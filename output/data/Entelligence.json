      "# [Entelligence Explore](https://docs.entelligence.ai/chat/explore)\nIntroduction\n\nUnderstanding a new codebase has always been a significant challenge for developers. Traditional code exploration tools often leave developers overwhelmed, providing raw access to code without context or guidance. They typically offer basic search functionality and documentation but lack the crucial element of guided discovery that developers need to truly understand complex codebases.\n\nEntelligence Explore addresses these limitations by offering an intelligent, guided approach to code exploration. Instead of leaving developers to navigate through countless files and folders blindly, our platform provides a structured, interactive journey through the codebase, combining visualization, explanation, and intelligent code navigation.\n\nWhy Entelligence Explore?\n\nTraditional approaches to code exploration face several challenges:\n\nLack of guided overview, forcing developers to piece together system architecture manually\n\nLimited context about how different components interact\n\nNo intelligent navigation between related code sections\n\nAbsence of visual representations for complex systems\n\nTime-consuming process of understanding implementation details\n\nEntelligence Explore solves these problems by providing:\n\nInteractive guided tours of codebases\n\nIntelligent code navigation and relationship mapping\n\nVisual representations of system architecture\n\nContextual explanations of implementation details\n\nSeamless integration of documentation, code, and visual elements\n\nSetting Up a New Codebase\n\nStep 1: Repository Addition\n\nNavigate to the intelligence repo and locate the repository addition interface. This is your starting point for bringing any codebase into the Entelligence ecosystem.\n\nDetailed Process:\n\nAccess the intelligence repo through your dashboard\n\nLook for the prominent \"Add Repository\" button in the top navigation\n\nThe interface provides clear visibility of all currently connected repositories\n\nStep 2: Repository URL Configuration\n\nEnter the URL of your target codebase. The platform accepts repositories from major version control systems including GitHub or GitLab. Choose the appropriate branch for analysis. While we recommend the main branch for stability, you can select any branch that best suits your needs.\n\nStep 3: Ingest all Issues and PRs for the codebase\n\nEntelligence provides you with the option to ingest all issues, PRs and documentation per codebase. This will index all the context for the codebase so that the advanced agent modes are able to retrieve relevant issues and PRs for a user's query. In the situation where your team stores issues through JIRA, Linear or another project management tool, you have the option to download all the relevant tickets from those platforms from the datasources. page.\n\nOnce the code base is set up, it's time to explore it:\n\nStep 1: Click on \"Onboard\". This provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the code base, highlighting the most important sections. This is only one of the multiple commands provided by Entelligence. All Entelligence queries use our custom trained model that identifies the key areas in the response that contain links to dive deeper into that section. Each section has the option to explain, find code or visualize that section.\n\nStep 2: Use the options to \"Explain\", \"Find the Implementation\", or \"Visualize\" any section of the code base.\n\nStep 3: Click on each section to understand how it's implemented or how it works. For instance, visualize the graph definition.\n\nStep 4: Visualize how the graph execution works. The system guides through each part, highlighting where in the code base to find an explanation.",
      "# [Entelligence AI Code Documentation](https://docs.entelligence.ai/documentation/ai-documentation)\nEntelligence supports generating automated codebase documentation complete with implementation details, code references, and automated diagrams.\n\nThe Entelligence codebase documentation agents automatically synthesize the codebase and generate a list of high level sections that break down the codebase into its key sections and then provide an architecture diagram, walkthrough and list of references for each section. Engineers in the team are then able to live edit and collaborate on the documentation to add or edit any extra details. Let's dive in and see how it works.\n\nStep 1: Generate the Documentation\n\nThe documentation tab lists out all of the codebases for which your organization has generated documentation and time of last update. Anyone in the organization can generate a documentation for any of the codebases available for the organization.\n\nStep 2: Understand the Architecture diagram\n\nEach key section in the codebase documentation includes an architecture diagram that explains the flow of the code. It's followed by a break down of the key components of this section with dynamic in line links. Each of these sections generate a live explanation of the section for a more thorough description of that section.\n\nThe documentation is always up-to-date with the latest commits. The AI agent deconstructs the large code base into key conceptual areas, providing a clear understanding of the code base.\n\nStep 3: Explore the Breakdown\n\nEach section is broken up into the key components. These are auto analyzed from the code hierarchy to combine all the important functions and functionality corresponding to each of the subsections. You can add a new subsection by hitting / and triggering a generation of a new section in the documentation.\n\nStep 4: Edit the Documentation\n\nYou're free to edit the documentation. For instance, if you want to add more explanation about how cycles work, go ahead and update it. The changes are saved live in our system. This allows for real time team collaboration and edits as well as enabling engineers to fill in any additional details or sections that might be missing in the original documentation.\n\nStep 5: Understand Specific Sections\n\nTo understand a particular section, click on it. The system will walk you through real-time updates of how cycles and lang graph are updated, including nodes, examples of a cycle, branching, different types of branching, and more.\n\nStep 6: Create Custom Sections\n\nThe document isn't static. You can create new custom sections and have the system walk through parts that it might not have captured on its own.\n\nStep 7: Refer to the Documentation\n\nAt the end of the process, you'll find the reference docs.\n\nYou can proceed to the next section by clicking on it.\n\nEach section follows this format of document, explanation, and interactive elements. You'll also find references that pull up the actual code snippets and files for better understanding of the section.\n\nStep 8: Try it Out\n\nWe're thrilled for you to try this out.\n\nEnjoy exploring this new feature!",

Styles Not Loading\n\nIf styles aren't appearing, ensure you've imported the CSS file:\n\nimport'@entelligence-ai/chat-widget/style.css';\n\nIf using Next.js, make sure the component is client-side:\n\n'use client'; import { EntelligenceChat } from'@entelligence-ai/chat-widget/react';\n\n2. SSR Issues\n\nFor Next.js SSR issues, use the following pattern:\n\nimport dynamic from'next/dynamic'; constEntelligenceChat=dynamic( () =>import('@entelligence-ai/chat-widget/react').then(mod =>mod.EntelligenceChat), { ssr:false } );\n\nCSS Requirements\n\nThe chat widget requires its stylesheet to function properly. The styles are packaged separately to:\n\nAllow better tree-shaking\n\nEnable custom styling\n\nSupport different bundler configurations\n\nImport Options\n\nIn JavaScript/TypeScript (Recommended)\n\n// At your app's entry point import'@entelligence-ai/chat-widget/style.css';\n\nIn HTML Head\n\n<linkrel=\"stylesheet\"href=\"node_modules/@entelligence-ai/chat-widget/style.css\">\n\nFramework-Specific Setup\n\nNext.js\n\n// pages/_app.tsx or app/layout.tsx import'@entelligence-ai/chat-widget/style.css'; exportdefaultfunctionApp({ Component, pageProps }) { return <Component {...pageProps} />; }\n\nVite\n\n// main.tsx or main.ts import'@entelligence-ai/chat-widget/style.css';\n\nWebpack\n\n// webpack.config.js module.exports= { module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.css$/, use: ['style-loader','css-loader'] } ] } };\n\nCommon Issues\n\nMissing Styles\n\nSymptoms: Widget appears unstyled or broken\n\nSolution: Ensure CSS is imported before widget initialization\n\nBuild Errors\n\nSymptoms: CSS import fails during build\n\nSolution: Configure bundler to handle CSS imports (see Webpack config above)\n\nSSR Issues\n\nSymptoms: Hydration warnings in Next.js\n\nSolution: Import CSS in _app.tsx or use next/dynamic with ssr: false\n\nBrowser Support\n\nChrome 60+\n\nFirefox 60+\n\nSafari 12+\n\nEdge 79+\n\nOpera 47+",
      "# [EntelligenceAI Docs](https://docs.entelligence.ai/getting-started/creating-team)\nCreating and Managing Teams in Entelligence\n\nThis guide provides a walkthrough on creating a team in Entelligence and outlines the functionalities available for admins and team members.\n\nStep 1:\n\nEntelligence provides support for individuals to configure their account for their own use as well as a part of a team. The left side bar includes a list of all the individual and organization codebases. Organization codebases can only be added by admins of the organization and will be visible to all members of the organization. Individual repositories can be added by anyone and are only visible to that individual.\n\nStep 2:\n\nAdd the code base to the 'Organization' category. It'll now be visible to all team members in that organization.\n\nStep 3:\n\nNavigate to the profile to view all teammates associated with this account. Each team member has access to the same code bases, docs, and resources by default.\n\nStep 4:\n\nAdmins have the ability to add new team members by clicking on Add Member.\n\nStep 5:\n\nTo add a new team member, simply input their email. This triggers an email to them. If they already have an account, they're automatically added to the organization. If not, they receive an email prompting them to create an account and join the organization. Once they have created an account, they will then be automatically added to the organization.",
      "# [Datasource Management](https://docs.entelligence.ai/getting-started/managing-datasources)\nIntroduction\n\nEntelligence offers powerful integration capabilities that allow you to connect and synchronize multiple data sources, enabling seamless management of code repositories, issues, and pull requests across various platforms. This guide explains how the data source management system works and walks you through the setup process.\n\nKey Features\n\nMulti-platform integration (GitHub, Jira, Linear, etc.)\n\nReal-time synchronization through webhooks\n\nAutomated PR review bot\n\nIntelligent issue solution suggestions\n\nContinuous updates and monitoring\n\nCentralized data source management\n\nHow Data Source Management Works\n\nEntelligence uses a centralized data source management system that:\n\nMaintains connections to your various development tools and platforms\n\nTracks the synchronization status of each data source\n\nProvides automated update mechanisms through webhooks\n\nEnsures data consistency across all integrated platforms\n\nCode Bases and Last Updated Time\n\nStep 1:\n\nAll datasource management can be found as a part of the user profile.\n\nStep 2:\n\nWithin the user profile, admins will have access to update the data sources tab. Each data source will list the last updated time as well as other relevant information such as the latest commit hash, PR number or issue number. You can setup continuous updates through a webhook for each of your codebases by clicking on the Continuous Updates button. This will configure the webhook to listen to all PR merge events in your Github repo and update Entelligence. This feature allows for continuous refreshing to keep all code bases, issues, and PRs current. Alternatively, you can click the refresh button to auto trigger a refresh for any datasource.\n\nPull Request Review Bot and Issue Solutions\n\nStep 3:\n\nFor each code base, enable the pull request review bot and issue solutions. These tools will directly respond to every issue in GitHub, Jira, or other product management tools. Please refer to the PR review bot section for detailed explanations for the review bot capabilities and configuration.\n\nStep 4:\n\nSet up continuous updates. This will establish a webhook to listen to real-time pushes made to the code base. The last updated time and commit id will be listed every time the refresh has been triggered. This will set up a webhook in your codebase which requires that we have webhook write permissions for the codebase.\n\nStep 5:\n\nApply the same steps for all issues and pull requests, regardless of whether they are in GitHub, Linear, Jira, etc.\n\nStep 6:\n\nConfirm the refresh status. For instance, the Princeton-nlp/SWE-agent is now entirely up to date.",

      "# [Entelligence.ai Dashboard](https://www.entelligence.ai/post/onboarding)\nGrok Large Codebases in Minutes\n\nBuilding features from scratch is an entirely different challenge compared to building features in large, gnarly codebases where you might have limited to no context. At Entelligence, we've thought through the onboarding process from the bottom up and built a system that works for engineers to get an understanding of the codebase at different levels of abstraction so that they understand both the overall architecture as well as where any part of code is implemented.\n\nCurrent Approaches to Onboarding:\n\nTraditional methods of onboarding to a new codebase are often time-consuming, frustrating, and inefficient. Let's break down the common approaches and their typical timelines:\n\nExploring the Codebase\n\n\"Navigating the codebase felt like piecing together a puzzle without a guide. I'd spend hours trying to understand the structure.\" - Raghav Dixit, Senior Developer\n\nDevelopers spend countless hours navigating through directories, trying to understand the project structure and relationships between different components. This process can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks, depending on the codebase's complexity.\n\nReading Documentation\n\n\"Onboarding to me is generally spending hours reading outdated docs and pestering my colleagues with questions regarding where I should be looking for things. The issue with products like Copilot is you need to know what to ask for it to be useful and early on you don't.\" - Mike Berdinis, Uber\n\nWhen documentation exists, it's often outdated or incomplete. Engineers might spend days sifting through wikis, READMEs, and comments, only to find that much of the information is no longer relevant.\n\nAsking Colleagues\n\n\"I feel like I'm constantly interrupting my teammates with questions. Our org is mostly remote so that ends up being sitting around waiting for people to reply on Slack. All around it honestly impacts everyone's productivity.\" - Alex Wang, Waymo\n\nNew team members often rely heavily on their colleagues for guidance, leading to frequent interruptions and reduced productivity across the team. This can continue for weeks or even months after joining.\n\nIn total, the traditional onboarding process can take anywhere from 3 to 8 weeks before a new developer becomes truly productive. This doesn't account for the ongoing learning curve that can extend for months as developers encounter new parts of the codebase.\n\nLimitation of Current Approaches AI-Powered Tools\n\nLimitations of Current AI-powered Tools While tools like GitHub Copilot, Codeium, or Cursor offer valuable assistance for specific coding tasks, they fall short in providing a comprehensive overview of the entire codebase. These tools are great for generating code snippets or offering suggestions, but they don't address the core challenges of understanding the overall architecture, relationships between components, or the \"big picture\" of how everything fits together. The result? Engineers are left without a clear understanding of the system as a whole, struggling to piece together the puzzle of a complex codebase. This fragmented approach not only extends the onboarding period but also increases the likelihood of introducing bugs or architectural inconsistencies in future development.\n\nThe Entelligence Philosophy\n\nAt Entelligence, we've reimagined the onboarding process with a revolutionary approach. Our philosophy is built on three key principles:\n\nAutomated Codebase Mapping: We instantly generate a comprehensive overview of the entire codebase, highlighting key modules, dependencies, and architectural patterns. This gives developers a clear \"big picture\" understanding from day one.\n\nInteractive Exploration: Our platform allows developers to click through different parts of the codebase, diving deeper into specific areas of interest. Each interaction provides context-aware explanations, making it easy to understand complex systems piece by piece.\n\nMulti-faceted Comprehension: We recognize that understanding code is a combination of visualization, explanation, and reading the code itself. Entelligence empowers engineers to seamlessly switch between these three modes of learning for any part of the codebase they're interested in, catering to different learning styles and depths of exploration.\n\nBy combining these principles, Entelligence provides a holistic understanding of codebases at various levels of abstraction. We empower developers to rapidly familiarize themselves with new projects, dramatically reducing onboarding time and enhancing overall productivity.\n\nWith Entelligence, engineers can:\n\nVisualize: See graphical representations of code structure, dependencies, and data flow.\n\nExplain: Get clear, context-aware explanations of code functionality and purpose.\n\nNavigate: Access the actual source code, with intelligent navigation and cross-referencing.\n\nThis flexible approach allows developers to engage with the codebase in the way that best suits their current needs and learning preferences, making the onboarding process more efficient and effective.\n\nUnleash Your Creativity and Exploration:\n\nWith Entelligence, you're not just reading about code - you're interacting with it. Our approach allows you to take your codebase creativity and exploration to new heights, making the onboarding process an exciting journey of discovery.\n\nCompetitor Comparison:\n\nWhile tools like Codeium, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor offer assistance in coding tasks, they fall short in providing a comprehensive onboarding experience. Here's how Entelligence stands out:\n\nFeatureEntelligenceGitHub CopilotCodeiumCursorDeep Dives✓✗✗✗Visualizations✓✗✗✗Comprehensive Overview✓✗✗✗Guided Exploration✓✗✗✗Easy Follow-ups✓✗✗✗\n\nSee It in Action:\n\nThe Technology Behind Entelligence:\n\n1. Advanced Code Graphs\n\nAt Entelligence, we've developed sophisticated graph algorithms that revolutionize how developers understand and navigate large codebases:\n\nOur system analyzes your codebase at every level of abstraction - from large directories down to individual classes and functions.\n\nThis multi-level approach allows us to capture a truly comprehensive overview of even the largest and most complex codebases.\n\nUsers can start with a high-level view and progressively drill deeper into specific areas of interest.\n\nThis unique capability sets Entelligence apart from other code exploration tools, which often struggle with large-scale codebases or only provide surface-level insights.\n\n2. Intelligent Hierarchy Analysis\n\nOur system goes beyond simple directory structures to provide a deep understanding of your code's hierarchical nature:\n\nWe meticulously map out all dependencies within your codebase, creating a web of interconnections.\n\nThis allows us to tie together all related parts of the code that are crucial for understanding a specific component or feature.\n\nWhen exploring a particular section, Entelligence can:\n\nPinpoint specific code chunks directly related to your area of focus.\n\nProvide a comprehensive overview of all dependencies, both direct and indirect.\n\nOffer intuitive navigation paths that follow the natural structure of your code.\n\nThis hierarchical understanding enables developers to quickly grasp the context and implications of any code they're working on.\n\n3. AI-Powered Visualizations\n\nEntelligence leverages cutting-edge AI to generate dynamic, context-aware visualizations of your code:\n\nOur system can create tailored diagrams for various levels of abstraction:\n\nIndividual classes or functions\n\nEntire files or modules\n\nFolder structures and their relationships\n\nHigh-level concepts and their implementations across the codebase\n\nThese visualizations adapt to your current needs, offering different types of concept maps depending on what's most relevant at the time.\n\nWhether you need a detailed class diagram, a high-level architecture overview, or a concept map showing how a feature is implemented across multiple modules, Entelligence can generate it on the fly.\n\nThis visual approach complements textual explanations and code snippets, catering to different learning styles and providing a more holistic understanding of the codebase.\n\nBy combining these three powerful technologies - Advanced Code Graphs, Intelligent Hierarchy Analysis, and AI-Powered Visualizations - Entelligence offers an unparalleled tool for code comprehension and navigation. It empowers developers to quickly familiarize themselves with new codebases, understand complex systems, and make informed decisions about code changes and architecture.",
      "# [Entelligence.ai Dashboard](https://www.entelligence.ai/post/pr-review)\nAnalysis Prompt\n\nYou are a senior staff engineer - analyze these code review comments and categorize each one into exactly ONE of:\n\nCRITICAL_BUG: Comments identifying serious issues that could cause crashes, data loss, security vulnerabilities, etc.\n\nNITPICK: Minor suggestions about style, formatting, variable names, or trivial changes that don't affect functionality\n\nOTHER: Everything else - general suggestions, questions, or feedback that don't fit the above.\n\nRespond with a JSON array where each object has:\n\n{ \"comment_index\": \"<index>\", \"Comment\": <comment>, \"category\": \"CRITICAL_BUG|NITPICK|OTHER\", \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation of why this category was chosen\" }\n\nIMPORTANT: Each comment MUST be categorized. The category field MUST be exactly one of CRITICAL_BUG, NITPICK, or OTHER.\n\nRemember: Only report issues that could actually break functionality or corrupt data at runtime.\n\nAttempt 1: Basic Classification\n\nUsed LLMs to categorize issues\n\nResult: Better than manual, but still subjective\n\nLimited by lack of context\n\nThis approach failed to actually improve the noise to real bug challenge. The review bot often ended up categorizing trivial issues as critical bugs without real backing. Additionally the review bot still lacked the proper awareness of the codebase in order to identify real issues versus trivial nits.\n\nAttempt 2: Full Context Analysis\n\nWe added:\n\nRepository-level context\n\nLanguage-based semantic parsing\n\nHistorical feedback learning\n\nThese changes allowed the PR to actually pull in the necessary method, class and function definitions from other parts of the codebase ensuring that the review is targeted and focused on real issues. In order to parse these file and function definitions efficiently, we use language based code parsing libraries to cross reference definitions within the rest of the code. This lead to more real actionable comments.\n\nAttempt 3: Multi-Layer Reflection\n\nBuilt a system that:\n\nAnalyzes the code change\n\nReviews its own analysis\n\nValidates against historical patterns\n\nFilters based on team preferences\n\nFinally this approach allows the PR review bot to include both the appropriate context from the codebase as well as learn from user feedback. This first narrows down real issues within the codebase and then further filters those issues regarding the user's prior behavior.",
      "# [Entelligence.AI](https://www.entelligence.ai/post/pr_review.html)\nI'm Aiswarya Sankar, founder of Entelligence.ai. We build AI-powered developer tools that help engineering teams ship better code faster. While building our AI code review system, we ran into a fundamental problem:\n\nThe Problem\n\nEvery major AI company has their own code review bot now. The market is getting crowded, but there's no standardized way to compare them. Everyone claims to catch 3x more bugs (a meaningless metric), others about time saved (hard to verify).\n\nWe needed answers to basic questions:\n\nAre these bots catching real bugs or just style nits?\n\nHow many of these issues matter to developers?\n\nHow many critical issues do they actually find?\n\nOur Approach: Build an Eval Framework\n\nWe decided to create the first open evaluation framework for code review bots. Here's how we did it:\n\nSet up multiple bots (including our own) on the same OSS codebases\n\nCollected 597 review comments across 5 different bots\n\nBuilt a classification system to categorize comments\n\nThe magic was in having multiple bots review identical PRs. This created a natural A/B test environment - we could see how different bots commented on exactly the same code changes, and more importantly, which comments developers actually addressed. We gathered data from over 200 PRs across these codebases, giving us a unique opportunity to compare bot effectiveness on a level playing field.\n\nChallenges in Building Good Evals\n\nBuilding effective evaluation systems for AI code review presents several significant challenges. One of the most fundamental issues is subjectivity - what constitutes a critical bug versus a simple nitpick can vary dramatically between different engineering teams and organizations. This variability makes it difficult to create standardized evaluation criteria that work across different contexts.\n\nCore challenges we identified:\n\nSubjectivity: What's a critical bug vs a nitpick varies by team\n\nContext Matters: Code reviews don't make sense in isolation\n\nFalse Positives: Bots often identify \"issues\" that aren't actually problems\n\nMeasurement Complexity: Simple metrics like \"number of comments\" aren't meaningful\n\nTo address these challenges, we implemented a systematic evaluation framework using large language models to ensure consistent classification across all reviews. This automated approach allowed us to apply identical criteria to every comment, eliminating the variability that often comes with human reviewers.\n\nEvaluation Methodology\n\nTo ensure consistent classification of code review comments, we developed an LLM-based evaluation system focused on functional and security issues. Here's our approach:\n\nFor each PR comment, we captured the comment text, related code, and developer response. This structured approach helped maintain consistency and focus on functional impact rather than style. We've open-sourced these evaluation criteria to help standardize industry practices.\n\nKey learnings:\n\nQuantity ≠ Quality: More comments often meant more noise\n\nContext is Crucial: Bots need codebase-wide context to make meaningful suggestions\n\nTeam Adaptation: Good review systems learn from team patterns\n\nFalse Positive Cost: Bad suggestions quickly lead to developers ignoring the bot\n\nWhat We Found\n\nMost code review bots have a major noise problem:\n\n45% of comments (on average) were pure style nits\n\nSome \"leading\" tools had up to 70% style comments\n\nOnly 20-40% of comments identified critical bugs",
      "# [Entelligence.ai Dashboard](https://www.entelligence.ai/post/scoble-interview)\nInterviewer:\n\nSo who are you?\n\nFounder:\n\nHey, I'm Aiswarya. I'm the founder of Entelligence.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nAnd what is that?\n\nFounder:\n\nAt Entelligence, we're working on building artificial engineering Entelligence. So a little bit about me first and how this came about - before starting Entelligence, I was at Uber for about four or five years and what I realized is that like a lot of tools right now - at Uber we were using Copilot for a while - and realized that all these tools are trying to replicate what engineers do. If you look at some of the top-performing engineers, what they were really excelling at was this kind of domain knowledge. They're people who are domain experts in different areas, which means they had a comprehensive understanding of how previous things were built, what different teams are doing, what teammates were doing, actually reviewing PRs and having a good understanding of the entire architecture and system. That simply isn't the case with current AI developer tools. So I wanted to set out to build this kind of system that would be able to help all engineers with the context and building things that they were doing at these large companies.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nAI engineering is a different ballgame than writing C++ code in the old world, right? This is a new world. Tell us a little bit about what you're seeing and what your company helps engineering teams with.\n\nFounder:\n\nI think there's been a few phases with using AI in engineering. I think as soon as ChatGPT came out, everyone was super excited that you could stick a chunk of code into GPT and get something else out, or you could ask it to write a basic app. It was able to come up with something remotely helpful, as well as you could ask it \"hey, this is some error message, what can you do about it?\" But all of this, I think people quickly realized - doing these things in isolation can make you a better Stack Overflow, but it's not going to actually help you build something in your system.\n\nThat was kind of the first phase, and then we saw the whole hype cycle around autocomplete solutions and Copilot and everything. What that was able to do is now it's obviously in your editor, it's able to kind of fill in a little bit about predicting what you're trying to do, understand some things around the before and after for that code.\n\nBut what people also started to realize is that in order to actually write real software engineering code, you need to understand a lot of things about how the system works, and none of these solutions right now are actually able to do that. I think now the next wave of these solutions are, as I said, how can you replicate how engineers are actually thinking about these solutions - which is understanding how this architecture works, knowing what these different components do, how different people are collaborating, and not only help write the code but help design the solutions, help review it, and kind of make sure the entire system is working together. So that's kind of the next phase of how AI can help engineers, and that's what we've been working on.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nI was talking to Dylan this morning - he runs an R&D group at Unity - and he's saying that this new world requires a different architecture, different thinking about architecture. Do you agree with that at all? And how does your system help get people into building? Like we're having to learn new ways to do things like RAG, retrieval systems. Give us a little taste of what you think of as new architectures.\n\nFounder:\n\nI would say there's really two large problems that pretty much any company building in the dev tool space has to learn and solve. One is this context awareness issue. There have been approaches with RAG, there's a lot of improvements obviously you have to make on top of it to make these systems work on top of code. We've seen a lot of things - one is integrating LSPs, being able to actually understand the code structure, being able to do graphical representation if you're trying to draw diagrams, how exactly are you doing the different layers for these code bases.\n\nSo that entire thing works into this context awareness, and it takes a few steps beyond just code. Again, if you look at current solutions, a lot of them do try to take in the entire codebase for context, but they're missing very critical things like time series awareness. If I work on a codebase, go work on something else, come back - I want to know what all has changed and how that's going to affect my future decisions. Getting recaps on the code, not only that but understanding when you're working in a team - it's very important to know what other people are doing. So is your system actually aware of individuals, how they're contributing, what's changing?\n\nAll of those things are a part of this first part of the problem, which is context awareness - do you understand how the codebase, how the org is working? If someone mentioned something in a PR or in Slack, does your system actually take that into account when it's making decisions? That's what engineers at engineering orgs do today, but most AI systems have none of that information.\n\nI think the second part of the problem is really planning - can you take that information that you now know about the system and use that to actually decide how to build things in a smart way? Both of these components are super critical to make systems that can actually work somewhat similar to how engineers are able to actually build things.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nYou're building like a pair programmer that would sit next to me, an AI that would interact with me right? Tell me what that pair programmer would do compared to a human pair programmer.\n\nFounder:\n\nYeah, so as I said, we really model this off of what I was seeing at these large companies. There's a few key tech leads that do this - they understand the entire system, they're the ones giving people feedback, mentorship, they're kind of the ones who review and sign off on different design decisions. And I was thinking how can we actually replicate something like that? Because if you think about it, they have a few key things that they're able to do.\n\nWe don't want just another human - we want an AI that actually has this full system awareness. There's a lot of simple low-hanging fruit there. If you think about it, a lot of times engineers that work at these large companies think about \"I want to build this feature\" - probably 10 people have done this before. Half of the problem there is just trying to find where those PRs are, who to reach out to, who to ask. That's one of the most common things that happens when you're trying to solve a new bug - finding who did it, asking someone, figuring out how to orient.\n\nRight now, yes, a tech lead who's been there 6-8 years probably knows that information, but if you can build an AI system that's actually robust enough to understand the entire time series of how this codebase has changed, what are those similar issues in PRs, it can point that out to you. So that's one of the things that we support now - you can search for similar issues or PRs in our platform and it will help you kind of walk through \"okay, this is something that's doing something similar to the ticket you're working on.\"\n\nOther low-hanging fruit, as mentioned - this isn't necessarily low-hanging fruit - but also being able to generate visualizations or diagrams. A lot of coding, I think in my first CS class in Berkeley they really highlight that coding is a lot about abstractions. If you're trying to look at the system as a whole, you do not want to understand how function A is implemented. There's kind of a lot of different abstraction layers, and when you're thinking about the system, you need to abstract away all the details you don't need to know so that you can focus on what's important and kind of go back and forth between these layers of abstraction.\n\nSo that's really something we also need to get our AI systems to be able to do. We've thought a lot about this when we generate diagrams - how can we use LSPs which will give you all the granular details about this function calls this with this class name under this thing, and actually zoom it out to a level that humans can understand like overall the big picture, and then kind of go in as needed.\n\nSo we don't want a pair programmer that just kind of like will walk you through \"okay this line of code doesn't seem right.\" We want actually something that can give you that overarching understanding of \"these are relevant things, this is how the system has been changing, if you want kind of an overview this is where you should look\" and that's kind of what we think engineers will want as they interact with AI and engineering.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nIt sounds like I use Limitless on my computer to record all my meetings and it really didn't become useful for a few weeks right because you had to get enough things in there for you to start seeing the usefulness of the search features and talking to it and stuff like that. And it sounds like the same thing is true here but also you're trying to - your AI system is trying to really understand the codebase over time. So first of all how long does it take to get set up for a team let's say I have five engineers and second of all how long does that team really have to give your tool to really get into it and understand it and for it to understand your codebase and really start working?\n\nFounder:\n\nThat's a good question. As I said, what we actually do is work with most companies that are not starting from scratch. We actually go in and ingest everything historical. The great thing about GitHub about code is that you have pretty much a sequential, an entire historical road map of how this code base came to be. So we're actually able to take all of that information into play so that if there is an issue in the past, we have access to that from day one.\n\nSo a lot of that kind of just knowledge, understanding of how your system came to be - we can just set it up from the very beginning and then as you keep developing on it we keep our entire thing up to date. But I think on top of that, just like everything that's in your code today, the other things is you're actually able to also feed it in things like your style guide, how you prefer code to be written, etc. All of those things also factor in so it's able to kind of understand what you're looking for in your codebase best practices.\n\nSo this really factors into our PR reviews and kind of issue solutions is understanding how you as a team, what you're looking for, so that it's able to kind of guide you the way you and your org have already found best.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nWill this comment your code as well? Because you know commenting is always a contention with developers - some people don't like to do it, some people really like to do it but they have their own style, and if you're working on a team you really need to stick with a standard way of commenting your code because somebody's going to have to use that code later.\n\nFounder:\n\nYeah, so what we found to do is - we've started off first just building those two core APIs that I mentioned which is the context awareness and planning and then now we've been over the last like month or two we've really been plugging that into all the interfaces that engineers need the most.\n\nIt started off with the website so if you're trying to onboard to the codebase we give you an entire onboarding guide you can understand like issues we do commented directly on your PRs. But recently we've also been expanding more of our VS Code interface. So within that you can have kind of all the functionality of highlight code explain it, add comments, you can visualize just a section of the code we have kind of very robust commands now.\n\nAs I said everything around search for an issue to search for relevant PR etc. are kind of all different commands that we've set up on our platform. So yeah, pretty much within your codebase you can also ask it to do and you can also build custom commands so if you want just something that goes in and comments every function, you can set up a custom command to go ahead and do that for you.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nSort of a similar question but a little bit deeper - what about testing and making sure that the system doesn't regress or anything like that? Do you write test cases for us and hook into a CI/CD? Do you work with other test suites? Because I know some teams have their own test suites that they hook into and stuff like that.\n\nFounder:\n\nYeah, yeah of course. How about I actually show you?\n\n[Demo section follows with VS Code walkthrough]\n\nInterviewer:\n\nWow all right so some things that are like - a lot of enterprises are really nervous about intellectual property and obviously you're giving it direct access to your intellectual property so tell us a little bit about how you think about privacy and do you use this to train another model in the future you know are you listening are you watching my screens you know all the kinds of conspiracy theories that people have \"oh my God I can't do this stuff not at work.\"\n\nFounder:\n\nI think as I said, security is super important in the space. I think as you mentioned, as soon as you mentioned code, that's kind of one of the first things that comes up. So we actually built our entire system from the very beginning to be fully self-hostable compatible. So essentially the entire thing right now you can either - we have an app on both AWS Marketplace and soon on other marketplaces so that the entire thing is kind of containerized and you can run it on your own servers.\n\nIf you are working at a larger company I think that's usually what works best. But in addition we're also in progress of getting our SOC 2. And how we look at security as far as fine-tuning models - again those are all kind of only per org. You get full access to the model. We do kind of tune on your previous issues and PRs in order to do the issue solutions because that is very customized per codebase per org. To become a domain expert you really need to fully understand that org setup but again obviously there's absolutely zero kind of sharing cross-org or cross domain and if you're self-hosting it we don't actually end up seeing those models.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nTell me a little bit about your business. Who are you working with, how many employees, how are you funded, the usual stuff about business?\n\nFounder:\n\nRight now we're a team of six based in San Francisco. Pretty small team - we just raised our seed actually so we will be disclosing our primary investors pretty soon. And yeah, we've been working with two design partners and we have several thousand engineers using the platform both on VS Code and our UI.\n\nWe actually recently kicked off a benchmark hackathon, so that's kind of where this agent list came out of - just helping engineers trying to understand all these different code bases. And with that we actually also put out our first these two APIs that I mentioned for if engineers want to continue to build on top of it.\n\nRight now as I said, our first design partners have really been focused on both the PR reviews so we have one of our customers does about 340 PRs a day using our system. VS Code is pretty new but we've been adding all these new functionality and are looking to start promoting it more very quickly.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nWhere do we learn more about you?\n\nFounder:\n\nYou can check us out at our website Entelligence.ai. I can drop links for our Discord."

      "# Post ID 1hl4kaf: How I used AI to understand how top AI agent codebases actually work! with +103 score by [(EntelligenceAI, Reddit, 2024-12-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1hl4kaf/how_i_used_ai_to_understand_how_top_ai_agent/)\nIf you're looking to learn how to build coding agents or multi agent systems, one of the best ways I've found to learn is by studying how the top OSS projects in the space are built. Problem is, that's way more time consuming than it should be.\n\nI spent days trying to understand how Bolt, OpenHands, and e2b really work under the hood. The docs are decent for getting started, but they don't show you the interesting stuff - like how Bolt actually handles its WebContainer management or the clever tricks these systems use for process isolation.\n\nGot tired of piecing it together manually, so I built a system of AI agents  to map out these codebases for me. Found some pretty cool stuff:\n\n**Bolt**\n\n* Their WebContainer system is clever - they handle client/server rendering in a way I hadn't seen before\n* Some really nice terminal management patterns buried in there\n* The auth system does way more than the docs let on\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1hu6ltm9sp8e1.png?width=2248&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd1f9ee6ae6a2f5f4707d0c5257cd7ab3902b192\n\nThe tool spits out architecture diagrams and dynamic explanations that update when the code changes.  Everything links back to the actual code so you can dive deeper if something catches your eye.  Here are the links for the codebases I've been exploring recently -\n\n\\- Bolt: [https://entelligence.ai/documentation/stackblitz&bolt.new](https://entelligence.ai/documentation/stackblitz&bolt.new)  \n\\- OpenHands: [https://entelligence.ai/documentation/All-Hands-AI&OpenHands](https://entelligence.ai/documentation/All-Hands-AI&OpenHands)  \n\\- E2B: [https://entelligence.ai/documentation/e2b-dev&E2B](https://entelligence.ai/documentation/e2b-dev&E2B)\n\nIt's somewhat expensive to generate these per codebase - but if there's a codebase you want to see it on please just tag me and the codebase below and happy to share the link!!  Also please share if you have ideas for making the documentation better :) Want to make understanding these codebases as easy as possible!\n\n## Comment ID m3ju1y1 with +7 score by [(femio, Reddit, 2024-12-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1hl4kaf/how_i_used_ai_to_understand_how_top_ai_agent/m3ju1y1/) (in reply to ID 1hl4kaf):\ni keep seeing posts that are similar to projects i've built myself wtf...3rd time since this weekend \n\none thing i'll share is that it really shouldn't be that expensive to create things like this. if you create a tool for an LLM that can grep a codebase's AST, you can generate some content using cheap LLMs (with some strategies for better accuracy like multiple passes) about each and perform RAG on those summaries. i did this just using 4o and 4o-mini for most of it, and Sonnet for the core documentation writing.\n\n### Comment ID m3nrfdr with +5 score by [(iudesigns, Reddit, 2024-12-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1hl4kaf/how_i_used_ai_to_understand_how_top_ai_agent/m3nrfdr/) (in reply to ID m3ju1y1):\nCould you expand more on what you mean by perform RAG on those summaries and etc… Legitimately curious (don’t have much background knowledge)\n\n### Comment ID m3w7owy with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-12-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1hl4kaf/how_i_used_ai_to_understand_how_top_ai_agent/m3w7owy/) (in reply to ID m3ju1y1):\nI’d be really interested in strategies you employ so I can better understand how to do that - cool stuff\n\n## Comment ID m3jtwpz with +4 score by [(qqpp_ddbb, Reddit, 2024-12-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1hl4kaf/how_i_used_ai_to_understand_how_top_ai_agent/m3jtwpz/) (in reply to ID 1hl4kaf):\nNICE JOB!\n\nDo the roo cline codebase:\nhttps://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Cline/\n\n### Comment ID m3jy7nd with +5 score by [(EntelligenceAI, Reddit, 2024-12-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1hl4kaf/how_i_used_ai_to_understand_how_top_ai_agent/m3jy7nd/) (in reply to ID m3jtwpz):\nDone u/qqpp\\_ddbb !

So like imagination. I’m pretty sure we have all the ingredients necessary for that with ML models and 3D graphics already.\n\nI think until we give an AI all the same sensory inputs that humans have, and make it look human, we’ll only be able to speculate until it’s obvious that it thinks the same way we do.\n\nBut will anything we make ever have qualia? That’s the big question. The only way to test it on a GAI would be to test it the same we do with humans. See if they say something, unprompted, that suggests that their experience of reality is subjective. Like if we gave a GAI some implicit motivations, make it do what ever required to recharge (which would involve becoming socialized with humans), then if it starts thinking philosophically on it’s own, and asks something like “is my red the same as your red?”. That seems like the only test that’s even physically possible.\n\n#### Comment ID ligw9qs with +4 score by [(666Emil666, Reddit, 2024-08-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/mathmemes/comments/1etqdop/all_hail_the_glorious_y_ax_e/ligw9qs/) (in reply to ID lifto0l):\n>and asks something like “is my red the same as your red?”.\n\nThis is also really complicated because most of AIs are feed large data sets, so long as they do that, any \"philosophical\" question or statement could just be the AI parroting what was in it's training data. \n\nAnd even if it generated a completely new statement that seems philosophical, how could we distinguish this from the AI simply forming a coherent sentence by chance?. This is similar to the \"talking animals\", where they aren't actually talking at all, and it's just a bunch of people seeing them make signs all day and wiring out whenever they happen to form a somewhat coherent set of signs together.\n\nI agree with you that we can't even talk about GAI until AI has robust freedom to experience to world or a part of it. And I believe that a major indicator of actual intelligence would be if the AI was actually capable of saying that it doesn't know something, forming \"opinions\" and arguing with the user.

We’ve only ever seen consciousness in biology, so parsimony says it’s only possibly through biology. \n\n2. Brains are decentralized frequency-based computers, whereas we only built centralized transistor-based computers.\n\n3.

If you do end up following up to this post with other model evals, please consider sharing more details about the statistical methodology, or making it easier to find if I am just missing it!\n\n## Comment ID mbucwpk with +2 score by [(Papabear3339, Reddit, 2025-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ikvj5w/i_compared_claude_sonnet_35_vs_deepseek_r1_on_500/mbucwpk/) (in reply to ID 1ikvj5w):\nUnsloth released a package that lets you add R1 style reasoning to any model.\n[https://unsloth.ai/blog/r1-reasoning](https://unsloth.ai/blog/r1-reasoning)\n\nIf claude simply released a \"3.6\" model where this was used on the 3.5 weights, I bet it would dramatically improve reasoning performance.\n\n## Comment ID mbuk7u9 with +2 score by [(subnohmal, Reddit, 2025-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ikvj5w/i_compared_claude_sonnet_35_vs_deepseek_r1_on_500/mbuk7u9/) (in reply to ID 1ikvj5w):\ni built a similar thing yesterday and it was buggy as hell. i do not trust an LLM with this type of analysis for now - at least, in a smaller scale experiment, with a local model, I was unable to replicate these results. got any picks for ollama? i’m scanning websites by IP, looking at the html and js bundle and scanning that with an llm instead. i am yet to read your blot posts, will come back to this\n\n## Comment ID mbumbfe with +2 score by [(OkBag8853, Reddit, 2025-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ikvj5w/i_compared_claude_sonnet_35_vs_deepseek_r1_on_500/mbumbfe/) (in reply to ID 1ikvj5w):\nOut of curiosity - how did you run DeepSeek?

What I'd like to know is: Does Sonnet perform better if it has R1's reasoning chain fed into it before going to work? My theory is that reasoning models allow the models attention to consider more aspects of the context by calling out these tokens effectively forcing the attention to consider these aspects. I've gotten great results feeding snippets of o1 onto Claude and letting Claude work as the Coding agent. Deepseek R1 should perform the same.\n\n\nYou could even test if Gemini Flash 2.0 Thinking yields similar results.

Some create chains with methods like CreateRetrievalChain and others construct them with LCEL. It’s not easy to translate between the two when I need to customize a retriever, for example. \n\nIt would be great to have a better comprehensive tutorial on how to *really customize* the elements in a pipeline. Like your RAG from scratch tutorials but with more of an explanation about which classes were used and *why*, and without using things like langhub or high level abstractions in a tutorial.\n\nThese are just little suggestions about what would make it easier for me to pick up your framework and use it, not issues.

I feel Langchain could benefit from more practical examples, especially around integrating LangChain with REST APIs, microservices, and vector databases. For example, I’ve been exploring how to structure chat history storage and retrieval using a vector database, and it’s been challenging to figure out the best practices for embedding and querying conversational context efficiently. \n\nAdditionally, I’m interested in using LangGraph with a RAG system within a dockerized vector database that can easily communicate with other applications via REST APIs. The goal is to store conversations efficiently while keeping only the relevant parts of the chat history and dynamically using RAG for additional context retrieval when needed. Concrete examples of such a setup would be invaluable—perhaps showing how LangGraph and LangChain could work together in a practical scenario like a chatbot or an analytics pipeline.\n\nIt would also be helpful to explore how to scale this setup for larger applications while maintaining performance, particularly when managing large volumes of chat history or embeddings. Are there any best practices or recommended patterns for balancing full chat histories and only keeping the relevant parts, especially in a vector database environment? Guidance on integrating these systems with external applications via REST APIs or microservices would also be incredibly valuable for developers working in multi-service environments.\n\nFor example, a detailed use case around multi-turn conversational agents with hybrid memory (local and RAG-based) could provide clarity on how to achieve this in a real-world application.\n\nLastly, I’ve noticed that when using class DesiredOutput(BaseModel) for structured LLM outputs, the depth and richness of the responses sometimes feel diminished. Is this a known behavior, or could I be implementing it incorrectly? Any insights on how to maintain the quality of responses in structured LLM?\n\n### Comment ID lyaq9z9 with +4 score by [(Fit_Influence_1576, Reddit, 2024-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1gwh09x/if_anyone_from_langchain_team_is_reading_this/lyaq9z9/) (in reply to ID ly9g1us):\nHonestly we’re at a point where the old version of the docs was actually better….\n\n### Comment ID lyagx1l with +3 score by [(Spiritual-End-3355, Reddit, 2024-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1gwh09x/if_anyone_from_langchain_team_is_reading_this/lyagx1l/) (in reply to ID ly9g1us):\nCan you add an example where routing to different sub graphs is handled based on user intent.

On a hackathon project, I was using an Anthropic model with structured output. When it needed to generate more than the default `max_tokens`, it would simply not generate one of the output fields and then it'd fail the structured output parsing so the error messages pointed me towards structuring issues. In contrast, OpenAI doesn't set a `max_tokens` so that situation is much less likely.\n\nThe information IS in the documentation it's just way down the page. It'd be great if the defaults could be included in \"Key init args\" section.\n\nThat said, I was in a rush so I take some blame. And it's also partly about inconsistent APIs.\n\nI also had some challenges in the tutorials for map-reduce summarization with `load_summarize_chain` around July or August but it looks like those docs have been updated.

      "# Post ID 1imq22r: Compared o3-mini, o1, sonnet3.5 and gemini-flash 2.5 on 500 PR reviews based on popular demand with +262 score by [(EntelligenceAI, Reddit, 2025-02-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1imq22r/compared_o3mini_o1_sonnet35_and_geminiflash_25_on/)\nI had earlier done an eval across deepseek and claude sonnet 3.5 across 500 PRs.  We got a lot of asks to include other models so we've expanded our evaluation to include o3-mini, o1, and Gemini flash!  Here are the complete results across all 5 models:\n\nCritical Bug Detection Rates:\n\n\\* Deepseek R1: 81.9%\n\n\\* o3-mini: 79.7%\n\n\\* Claude 3.5: 67.1%\n\n\\* o1: 64.3%\n\n\\* Gemini: 51.3%\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jxbynlv7pfie1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffab14e4f7ed18ed5a36965a30967b79fbcd9dfb\n\nSome interesting patterns emerged:\n\n1. The Clear Leaders: Deepseek R1 and o3-mini are notably ahead of the pack, with both catching >75% of critical bugs. What's fascinating is how they achieve this - both models excel at catching subtle cross-file interactions and potential race conditions, but they differ in their approach:- Deepseek R1 tends to provide more detailed explanations of the potential failure modes- o3-mini is more concise but equally accurate in identifying the core issues\n2. The Middle Tier: Claude 3.5 and o1 perform similarly (67.1% vs 64.3%). Both are strong at identifying security vulnerabilities and type mismatches, but sometimes miss more complex interaction bugs. However, they have the lowest \"noise\" rates - when they flag something as critical, it usually is.\n3. Different Strengths:- Deepseek R1 had the highest critical bug detection (81.9%) but also maintains a low nitpick ratio (4.6%)- o3-mini comes very close in bug detection (79.7%) with the lowest nitpick ratio (1.4%)- Claude 3.5 has moderate nitpick ratio (9.2%) but its critical findings tend to be very high precision- Gemini finds fewer critical issues but provides more general feedback (38% other feedback ratio)\n\nNotes on Methodology:\n\n\\- Same dataset of 500 real production PRs used across all models\n\n\\- Same evaluation criteria (race conditions, type mismatches, security vulnerabilities, logic errors)\n\n\\- All models were tested with their default settings\n\n\\- We used the most recent versions available as of February 2025\n\nWe'll be adding a full blog post eval as before to this post in a few hours! Stay tuned!\n\nOSS Repo:  [https://github.com/Entelligence-AI/code\\_review\\_evals](https://github.com/Entelligence-AI/code_review_evals)\n\nOur PR reviewer now supports all models!

TLDR: a lot of the bug reports created on curl's repo are just AI hallucinated slop. As far as I've heard DS has the highest hallucination rate and do you have anything to mitigate this issue from affecting your results?\n\n**EDIT:**   \nplease provide your methodology, I have checked your code on your linked github, as far as I know there is nothing regarding hallucination prevention, my questions will be\n\n1. How do you get these results (I.E the DeepSeek with 81.9%), how is it evaluated to these results\n2. Do you have a manual test or some sort of unit test from GH Actions on whether these repo actually have these issues to begin with, whether these issues are created artificially or not? And does the fix actually solve the problem?\n3. Are there any false positives? And do you have any sort of method to prevent them?\n\nI also noticed someone opened a discussion on your repo [https://github.com/Entelligence-AI/code\\_review\\_evals/issues/1](https://github.com/Entelligence-AI/code_review_evals/issues/1), this user's question is completely valid and it make sense, perhaps reply to his post or to mine or both. Because according to the curl repo, a lot of these AI hallucinated bug reports, they attempt to fix something that does not exist. And if your result has no safe-guard against these hallucinations, so due to this issue and as to my knowledge, the results will not be accurate or true. It means you have reached the wrong conclusion, hence the results are misleading in a way\n\nI know you put effort on this, and it probably exceeded your intended purpose, but then again I prefer that you respond to my comment or that user's discussion thread\n\n### Comment ID mdqs47m with +1 score by [(EntelligenceAI, Reddit, 2025-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1imq22r/compared_o3mini_o1_sonnet35_and_geminiflash_25_on/mdqs47m/) (in reply to ID mc4yv3v):\nhey u/Remicaster1 we used LLM's as a judge for this passing in the context of the comment, code chunk to determine if it is valid or not.

So far it seems like this is a case of \"How many bugs you can identify regardless\" rather than \"How many bugs that actually causes problem, can be identified accordingly\". Like the post I've listed above, where AI hallucinates a bug that is not existent in the codebase, there seems to be no measure from your end to identify this as a false positive and from your statement above, you have confirmed this, meaning there is no way to identify false positives created by hallucinations\n\nAlso, please reveal all of the methodology, from what I've seen in the github repo and the blog, the prompt was not according to the best practices of Anthrophic guidelines. Not all the analyzers were present as well such as DeepSeek and OpenAI ones. If a benchmark result cannot be reproduced, it is a bad benchmark because it does not have any validity, not reliable as no independent researchers can verify the results, and indicate your benchmarks have a lower confidence in terms of the results obtained. \n\nTo emphasize on the importance of the ability to replicate a benchmark, think of something like \"Rust is 80% faster than CPP across 1000 repos conducted\", but there is no way to know what types of repo are being analyzed, how it is analyzed, and how the results are being concluded and completely unable to replicate the result. It completely invalidates the benchmarks as it became a \"trust me bro\" moment\n\nI hope that you take this as a valid criticism to improve your benchmarks. Based on your username, i believe you are not acting on a solo individual, and on top of that you are selling this as a product service. It is important to have your benchmark to be reliable as your entire service is based on this product. And from what can be observed at the moment, it is not reliable.\n\n## Comment ID mc5hvkj with +3 score by [(inmyprocess, Reddit, 2025-02-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1imq22r/compared_o3mini_o1_sonnet35_and_geminiflash_25_on/mc5hvkj/) (in reply to ID 1imq22r):\nI truly thought that the coding benchmarks meant next to nothing as they are just algorithm puzzles (that can be grokked well cause they're perfect training data for LLMs) .. but your results are totally inline.

      "# [Box Office: How ‘Snow White’ Landed in Potential Bomb Territory by Pamela McClintock on 2025-03-25](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/is-snow-white-box-office-bomb-1236170816/)\nThe mood was grim Sunday on the Disney lot as Snow White opened behind expectations to an estimated $43 million domestically. Globally, the live-action remake of the iconic 1937 film was expected to clear $100 million, but instead came in at $87.3 million.\n\nFinal weekend numbers released Monday showed the domestic opening coming in lower at $42.2 million; ditto for global. The pic took in $43.9 million overseas for a global start of $86.1 million, according to Comscore.\n\nWhile those hauls wouldn’t normally spell disaster for a female-targeted pic, Snow White has found itself in potential bomb territory because of its hefty production budget of $270 million before another $100 million or so in marketing costs.\n\nBased on initial ticket sales and mixed word-of-mouth, Snow White may have trouble getting to $300 million or $400 million globally, well short of a box office safety net of $500 million or more, several rival studios execs and box office pundits tell THR. (Consider that 2019’s Dumbo, which debuted to $45 million domestically, topped out at $353 million against a $170 million budget.)\n\nDisney supporters would say if anyone is capable of pulling off a fairy-tale ending, it’s them. Case-in-point: Over Christmas 2024, many in the media immediately wrote off Mufasa: The Lion King when it opened to $35.4 million domestically. The live-action pic did seven times its opening number, a rare feat, to top out at nearly $718 million globally. Elemental was another movie that Disney rescued post-release with a five-time multiple before it became a streaming sensation.\n\nThe big difference: Those two films weren’t dogged by underwhelming reviews and so-so exit scores. Snow White is the rare Disney live-action remake that earned a B+ CinemaScore from audiences; almost every film has received some variation of an A grade.\n\nSnow White also had to contend with headlines related to Rachel Zegler, the young lead actress not afraid to speak her mind, even if it meant taking on President Donald Trump’s MAGA movement. Far-right conservatives have labeled the film “Snow Woke,” and sprang into action by disliking trailers and other advertising materials, along with calling for a boycott of the film after Zegler criticized the president’s deportation policies. Several days later, she apologized for the tone of the post.\n\nBut data shows the average moviegoers may be paying far less attention to the political dynamics than social media and news headlines would suggest.\n\nAccording to a poll conducted by Steve Buck’s research firm EnTelligence, 63 percent of ticket sales for family and animated films generally come from blue states, while 37 percent come from cinemas in red states. In the case of Snow White, it overindexed in red states at 40 percent.\n\nThe pattern for general audience followed the same trajectory. Cinemas in blue states generally account for 67 percent of all ticket sales, while red states account for 33 percent. In the case of Snow White, blue states came in behind the norm at 60 percent of all sales, while red states accounted for 40 percent.\n\n“In spite of prerelease concerns of a boycott in red leaning districts, there is no evidence to support that occurred,” says EnTelligence founder Buck.\n\nThough Snow White landed a rare B+ CinemaScore, on the plus side, female moviegoers and moviegoers under the age of 18 gave it an A- CinemaScore. And parents and kids polled by market leader PostTrack gave the film four out of five stars, compared to three out of five stars among general audiences. However, only 50 percent of kids said they would tell their friends to see the film right away.\n\nSnow White‘s budget steadily rose because of strict COVID protocols, 2023’s labor strikes and a fire on set. (One source says the pic was originally greenlit at between $200 million and $210 million.) There were also creative concerns that required additional work. Snow White was made by the previous regime at Disney’s live-action studio, which is now led by David Greenbaum, who suggested certain tweaks when taking the job a year ago.\n\nThe world has changed dramatically since Disney decided to make a live-action Snow White, which seemed like a safe bet considering the success of other Disney live-action princess remakes. Beauty and the Beast astounded when opening to $174.6 million domestically in mid-March 2017, not adjusted for inflation. In the spring of 2015, Cinderella debuted to $67.9 million domestically against a much more modest budget of $90 million; Maleficent launched to $69 million in May 2014 (the sequel, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, stalled at $37 million).\n\nComscore chief box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian acknowledges that given its hefty budget, Snow White didn’t get off to an ideal start. He says its fate in terms of profitability will depend on “its long-term playability in theaters, eventual streaming, merchandising, music revenue plus theme park tie-ins.”",

      "# [AI News #73: Week Ending 2025/02/21 with Executive Summary, Top 53 Links, and Helpful Visuals by ethanbholland on 2025-02-22](https://ethanbholland.com/2025/02/22/ai-news-73-week-ending-2025-02-21-with-executive-summary-top-53-links-and-helpful-visuals/)\nAbout This Week’s Covers\n\nThis week’s cover pays homage to the namesake of xAI’s flagship language model Grok. The big story this week is that Grok-3 was released, and the name Grok comes from the Robert Heinlein novel “Stranger in a Strange Land”. The word means to ‘to understand intuitively or by empathy’. This week’s cover is a robot remake of the original novel’s cover. I tried to have Grok make the cover, but it failed miserably. I ended up using flux pro. Claude sonnet 3.5 helped me identify the key descriptors to re-create the atmosphere of the image (below).\n\nThe covers this week were built, using the entire prompt from flux with the request to modify them into each particular category using Claude + Ideogram.\n\nThis Week By The Numbers\n\nTotal Organized Headlines: 634\n\nAGI: 18 stories\n\nAgents and Copilots: 132 stories\n\nAmazon: 1 story\n\nAnthropic: 12 stories\n\nApple: 7 stories\n\nAudio: 30 stories\n\nAugmented Reality (AR/VR): 24 stories\n\nBusiness and Enterprise: 41 stories\n\nChips and Hardware: 36 stories\n\nEducation: 6 stories\n\nEthics/Legal/Security: 56 stories\n\nGoogle: 32 stories\n\nImages: 27 stories\n\nInternational: 35 stories\n\nLocally Run: 3 stories\n\nMeta: 13 stories\n\nMicrosoft: 19 stories\n\nMobile: 3 stories\n\nMultimodal: 46 stories\n\nOpen Source: 109 stories\n\nOpenAI: 68 stories\n\nPerplexity: 23 stories\n\nPodcasts/YouTube: 1 story\n\nPublishing: 8 stories\n\nRAG: 2 stories\n\nRobotics Embodiment: 29 stories\n\nSafe Superintelligence: 1 story\n\nScience and Medicine: 31 stories\n\nTechnical and Dev: 76 stories\n\nVideo: 27 stories\n\nX: 66 stories\n\nThis Week’s Executive Summaries\n\nThe top story this week was that xAI launched Grok-3, which claimed the top spot in the AI model rankings. This puts the lag between X and OpenAI at about nine months. This is similar to the gap between DeepSeek and OpenAI. I’m not an expert, but my impression is that DeepSeek got to where they were through efficiencies and reinforcement learning, whereas X was able to get their results by throwing massive amounts of computing power and scale at the problem (see the Colossus supercomputer project). Part of me wonders what the next models will look like when you combine these two techniques: scale and reinforcement learning. The rumor is that Anthropic is going to launch a new version of Claude in the next week or two. OpenAI and Meta also have new updates coming soon. The horse race continues!\n\nThe second big story this week is that Microsoft has developed a completely new state of matter that they plan to use for quantum computing. My takeaway here is that while other companies are chipping away—no pun intended—at quantum computing using traditional techniques, Microsoft took a step back, like Tiger Woods relearning his swing, came out with a completely new architecture, and literally created a new type of matter!\n\nGoogle came out with a new AI research tool called Co-Scientist. A university researcher took 10 years of his own work and asked Co-Scientist what it thought the answer would be—without telling the system any details and using only a simple prompt. In 48 hours, Google’s system was able to recreate 10 years of research.\n\nThe New York Times has formally adopted AI in the newsroom, approving a variety of tools, including its own proprietary tool called Echo. This does not conflict with the NYT’s lawsuit against OpenAI, but it does show that AI is becoming widely embraced, even by the most traditional publishers.\n\nPerplexity has reconfigured the Chinese open model DeepSeek and turned it into a new tool called Deep Research, which is able to research and reason at almost the same level as OpenAI’s $200/month research model.\n\nPerplexity also retrained DeepSeek to remove its biases and censorship and has re-released DeepSeek as R1 1976.\n\nRobotics company Figure has released its own proprietary multi-modal model that allows robots to pick up objects they have never seen before and understand them simply by receiving natural language instructions. This comes only a few weeks after Figure announced that they would no longer partner with OpenAI. The new model for the robots runs at a spectacular 200 times per second and has been tested on thousands of household items that the robots had never seen before. Impressively, the system runs on regular computer chips.\n\nAnother big name from OpenAI announced a new company after several months of silence, presumably due to non-compete agreements. The former CTO of AI, Mira Murati, has founded Thinking Machines Lab.\n\nMicrosoft came out with a new system that can let any large language model understand computer interfaces by detecting everything that can be clicked on and mapping their functions back to language commands.\n\nGoogle announced that Gemini will now be able to remember all chat histories and converse between chats to give continuity and personality to users who want to resume where they left off or connect multiple chats.\n\nOpenAI created a benchmark to test models against actual programming tasks using the website Upwork. OpenAI found about 1,400 tasks that language models struggle to complete and will use this benchmark to track progress over time. The goal is to see when language models are able to achieve $1 million in productivity value across multiple projects.\n\nChatGPT-4 has been upgraded without being renamed and now holds the number one position in six major categories. Of course, this all comes at the same time as Grok and other releases, so it’s almost like following a bouncing ball with the leaderboard.\n\nxAI’s Grok-3 Claims Top Spot in AI Model Rankings\n\nxAI released Grok-3, which ranks first place on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard with a record-breaking 1400 score. Grok-3 outperforms leading models like GPT-4, Gemini 2 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on key benchmarks, particularly in math, science, and coding tasks. The model was trained using 200,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs – double the hardware used for Meta’s Llama 4. The system includes three specialized modes: Think, Big Brain, and DeepSearch, with the latter offering web search capabilities similar to recent offerings from Google and OpenAI. While Grok-3 hit impressive benchmarks, it will take a few weeks to know if Grok-3 prevails in real-world tasks. Audio input and output features are planned for the coming weeks. One take away that is consistent with the recent deep seek disruption is that the gap between closed models and open models is about 6-9 months, a relentless pace.\n\n“Grok 3 drops tomorrow night—xAI’s billion-dollar bet on scaling. Reminder: xAI built Colossus, the world’s most powerful AI training cluster (100,000+ NVIDIA H100s in just 122 days) to train Grok 3.

The breakthrough enables qubits that are 100 times smaller than current versions and could accelerate the timeline for practical quantum computers from decades to years. The microscopic qubits, measuring 1/100th of a millimeter, create a path to processors containing a million quantum bits. for now, there is not much practical use but scientifically and for the future this is a big deal. Microsoft decided to go the slower route and create an entirely new state of matter, as opposed to banging their head on the bottlenecks of existing structures.\n\nSatya Nadella on X: “A couple reflections on the quantum computing breakthrough we just announced… Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas.
