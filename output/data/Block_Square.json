  "summary_markdown": "# About Block\n\nBlock, Inc., formerly known as Square, Inc., is a prominent American technology company founded on February 1, 2009, by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/square). The company is headquartered in San Francisco and employs over 5,000 people as of 2023 [(Wikimedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.). Block operates in the financial technology sector, focusing on economic empowerment through its diverse range of platforms, including Square, Cash App, TIDAL, TBD, and Spiral [(Block, 2023)](https://block.xyz/).\n\nBlock's flagship product, Square, is a point-of-sale (POS) system that allows businesses to accept card payments and manage various operations such as e-commerce, inventory, payroll, and banking. As of 2024, Square is the market leader in POS systems in the U.S., with 4 million merchants using the platform [(Wikimedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\nThe company serves a broad customer base, including individual users of Cash App and businesses utilizing Square for payment processing. Block generates revenue through transaction fees, subscription services, and hardware sales. In 2023, Block reported an annual revenue of $21.9 billion [(Wikimedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\nBlock has expanded its service offerings through strategic acquisitions, such as the $29 billion acquisition of Afterpay, a buy now, pay later service, and a $297 million acquisition of a majority stake in TIDAL, a music streaming service [(Wikimedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Jack Dorsey**: Co-founder and CEO of Block, Inc. Dorsey is also known for co-founding Twitter. He has been instrumental in guiding Block's strategic direction, particularly following the company's rebranding [(Wikimedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n- **Amrita Ahuja**: Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Block, Inc. Ahuja plays a crucial role in managing the company's financial strategy during its growth phase and amid regulatory challenges [(Wikimedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n# News\n\n## Acquisitions and Partnerships\n\nBlock has been active in expanding its portfolio through acquisitions. The acquisition of Afterpay in January 2022 for $29 billion in stock was a significant move to enhance its financial services offerings [(Wikimedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).

The company is expected to see a return to double-digit growth in its Gross Payment Volume (GPV) by 2025, driven by international expansion and product innovation [(Tipranks, 2025)](https://www.tipranks.com/news/block-changes-ticker-to-xyz-to-give-a-holistic-business-appeal).\n\n## Service Issues and Regulatory Scrutiny\n\nIn 2023, Block experienced service outages affecting Square and Cash App, attributed to Domain Name System (DNS) issues. The company has since taken steps to prevent future disruptions [(Wikimedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.). Additionally, Block has faced regulatory scrutiny over compliance lapses, particularly with its Cash App platform. In January 2025, Block agreed to pay $175 million to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for failures related to user fraud on Cash App [(Hagens Berman, 2025)](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/31/3018947/32716/en/Block-Inc-XYZ-Faces-Securities-Class-Action-Regulators-Levy-Cash-App-Fines-Following-Investigations-Going-Back-to-Hindenburg-Report-Hagens-Berman.html).\n\n## Legal Challenges\n\nBlock is currently facing a securities class action lawsuit, with several law firms encouraging investors to secure counsel before important deadlines [(Morningstar, Inc., 2025)](https://www.morningstar.com/news/pr-newswire/20250203ny09372/the-gross-law-firm-notifies-shareholders-of-block-incsq-of-a-class-action-lawsuit-and-an-upcoming-deadline). The lawsuit is related to allegations of securities fraud and regulatory fines following investigations into the company's practices [(Morningstar, Inc., 2025)](https://www.morningstar.com/news/globe-newswire/9337486/block-inc-xyz-faces-securities-class-action-regulators-levy-cash-app-fines-following-investigations-going-back-to-hindenburg-report-hagens-berman).\n\n## Market Position and Future Outlook\n\nBlock's diverse portfolio, including Square, Cash App, Afterpay, and TIDAL, positions it strongly within the fintech landscape. Analysts have a \"Strong Buy\" consensus rating for Block, reflecting optimism about its growth potential [(Tipranks, 2025)](https://www.tipranks.com/news/block-changes-ticker-to-xyz-to-give-a-holistic-business-appeal).

For a site like [ui.introlix.xyz](http://ui.introlix.xyz), it can work if your target audience is tech-savvy or used to modern TLDs. However, if you’re aiming for a broader audience, upgrading to a .com could help with credibility and click-through rates.

The US Postal service has a domain that they use for everything so it seems like a no-brainer.  DO NOT click it or copy/paste, etc.   Now with that said, it's not simply a problem of any business using .xyz, but it is a problem with a sender claiming to be someone I do transact with asking me to follow a link to a domain that has a questionable address/URL.\n\nI am sure I am not the first to warn you about this kind of thing.\n\nCarry on and stay safe my friends.

      "# Post ID tbthjj: [PSA] Newer TP-Link Routers send ALL your web traffic to 3rd party servers... with +2025 score by [(ArmoredCavalry, Reddit, 2022-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/tbthjj/psa_newer_tplink_routers_send_all_your_web/)\nI recently enabled a DNS gateway to be able to see requests from my router, and network devices. Was surprised to find 80K + requests (in 24 hours) out to an Avira \"Safe Things\" subdomains `*.safethings.avira.com` (far more than any other server).\n\nDigging into this more, I found that it is related to the built-in router security \"Home Shield\" that ships with newer TP-Link routers - [https://oem.avira.com/en/solutions/safethings-for-router-manufacturers](https://oem.avira.com/en/solutions/safethings-for-router-manufacturers)\n\nHere is the kicker though, I have the Avira / Home Shield services completely turned off (I wasn't even subscribed to their paid service for it). The router doesn't care, and sends ALL your traffic to be \"analyzed\" anyhow. See this response from TP Link (towards bottom of review) from last year - [https://www.xda-developers.com/tp-link-deco-x68-review/#:\\~:text=TP%2DLink%20says%20the%20network%20activity](https://www.xda-developers.com/tp-link-deco-x68-review/#:~:text=TP%2DLink%20says%20the%20network%20activity) Update: I emailed reviewer to confirm TP-Link never updated him after.\n\nI contacted support about this again, and was given a non-answer about how the requests are to check subscription status. 80K + requests a day to check subscription status? Why would it even need to do 1 single subscription check, if I'm not enabling any functionality that is behind a subscription paywall? Also the rate of requests is not constant, it is higher when my internet traffic is higher. To me this lack of consistent answer / response from TP-Link is as concerning as the requests themselves.\n\nI'm not seeing much online about this issue, as I don't think many people realize it is even occurring (since traffic is outgoing straight from router, as opposed to an individual computer). Hoping to gain some attention on this issue and get a real answer / response from TP-Link about what exactly is going on here. As well as a **concrete timeline** and promise for a fix to stop these outgoing requests, when we aren't even using their anti-virus services.\n\nEdit: Additional details, this is on their WiFI 6 AX3000 (Archer AX55) Router. From the XDA Review looks like this is also happening on their Deco series. If you want to easily check your own router, you can use any DNS Gateway ([NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/), [Cloudflare Gateway](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/gateway/) Pi-Hole etc.) Just be sure to set the DNS servers under \"Advanced->Network->Internet->Advanced Settings\" because the DHCP DNS server setting will only apply to the devices inside the network, not the router itself.\n\nEdit #2: I've also contacted Avira directly regarding the endpoints, in the hope that they'll be more straightforward than TP-Link about the purpose. Will update here when I receive a response. Update: Avira support got back to me and said they couldn't answer any questions because I'm not a paying customer. So they can collect data, for free, but not tell me what the data is...\n\nEdit #3: If anyone knows of good industry contacts, who can dig into this more or get real answers, please send a message! I've seen GamerNexus brought up a few times, but don't see any contact method.\n\n# Update: Temporary Fix!\n\nDiscovered this late, but in case someone gets here from Google, etc. I noticed that if I block the `*.safethings.avira.com` subdomains, then **reboot the router**, this seems to prevent it going into the retry-loops when DNS lookup fails. There must be a flag that is set in-memory if the first time the router is ever able to successfully contact the domains? Rebooting after blocking prevents this flag ever getting set. So without the retries involved, this hugely reduced the router CPU usage when blocking for me. The router is actually now attempting requests less than when not blocked at all.\n\n# Beta Firmware Update\n\nTP-Link has posted links to beta firmware that claims to fix the issue. Note:  It hasn't been verified whether the update actually reduces requests to Avira, or simply caches the DNS query (then makes requests directly to IP) - [https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/3329/](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/3329/)\n\n# Press Release by TP-Link Korea\n\nThanks to /u/Lord_Buffum for sharing this - [https://www.tp-link.com/kr/press/news/19964/](https://www.tp-link.com/kr/press/news/19964/)\n\nEssentially they say that the *frequency* (not existence) of DNS requests is a bug that will be fixed, but never explain  **WHY** the router needs to contact Avira with HomeShield disabled. To me this adds almost no reassurance or new info. We already knew Avira is used for HomeShield, and that DNS lookups to Avira are to get the IP address. What we don't know is 1) Why the requests are being made with the service disabled, and 2) What data is even being sent in the requests (and why). Translated relevant bits below -\n\n1. TP-Link HomeShield uses AVIRA services to protect its customers' networks from cybersecurity threats. AVIRA is a global cybersecurity software company based in Germany, now a brand of the Norton LifeLock group ([www.avira.com](http://www.avira.com)).\n\n>Because this service operates by accessing the AVIRA Cloud service, the router periodically checks the AVIRA Cloud IP address. The router sent a DNS query to check this IP address. In order for the router to continue to use AVIRA cloud services, ***it is necessary to periodically send DNS queries as it must be able to access AVIRA's IP***.  \n>  \n>However, as a result of examining the software, we found a defect in the DNS request logic where requests occur frequently, and our TP-Link has optimized the software to reduce such frequent queries. Customers will be able to update the firmware of these products soon.  \n>  \n>2. DNS query is to query a domain name, and send a DNS request to request the domain name of the AVIRA server.  \n>  \n>As a DNS query, no personal information is included in these requests.\n\n## Comment ID i097j3i with +256 score by [(ArmoredCavalry, Reddit, 2022-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/tbthjj/psa_newer_tplink_routers_send_all_your_web/i097j3i/) (in reply to ID tbthjj):\nI also have tried blocking / redirecting the DNS queries, but this results in the router getting stuck in retry loop (thousands of requests a minute), and a big spike in router CPU usage as a side effect.

Just thinking about this makes me feel really bad and angry.\n\nBut then I'm used to ISPs routing all traffic to specific city hundreds of kilometers away as the \"gateway to the world\" so that the traffic can come back to city near me... Remote connecting to PC 10 km apart results in 100 ms of delay. Plus they scan all your requests and warn you when you try to open website that they think is malicious. Add the constant telemetry from everything including Windows, antiviruses etc and the TP-Link issue doesn't seem that outrageous...\n\nAt this point I think we NEED a law that forces companies to let you easily turn off ALL the traffic that is not essential to the device/app to work correctly. Same thing as cookies but extended for devices (like routers) and apps (like Windows and antiviruses).\n\n### Comment ID i0a176c with +48 score by [(CSFFlame, Reddit, 2022-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/tbthjj/psa_newer_tplink_routers_send_all_your_web/i0a176c/) (in reply to ID i09dvwu):\n> Plus they scan all your requests and warn you when you try to open website that they think is malicious.\n\nDon't use your ISP's DNS.\n\n#### Comment ID i0a7j9j with +12 score by [(CoUsT, Reddit, 2022-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/tbthjj/psa_newer_tplink_routers_send_all_your_web/i0a7j9j/) (in reply to ID i0a176c):\nOf course I changed that on my current network and setup. Still, anything leaving my network goes thru their main hub of some sort about 250 km away. I think DNS requests are not encrypted so they can still see them. My main issue is the poor routing though. It really sucks when I remote into my desktop PC and I have 100 ms. Or when I open Google Maps and it automatically opens the city they think I'm in - which is the city the traffic is routed to by ISP before going into internet.

You'd just trunk your vlans to the APs, and in the wireless controller set your SSIDs to use <x> tag for each network. Use PFSense to filter intervlan traffic and do the actual routing. If you have wired backhaul everywhere, might as well have good wifi coverage all throughout the house. \n\nYou can always just do baby steps.

As I was going thru the settings when I first got it (as I do with literally every electronic device I get - review every single setting of every single settings page), I noticed it had an IP address pre-programmed for the WAN DNS. I first set it to DHCP and then rebooted the router, only to find that IP was back in the WAN DNS after reboot. [pingtool.org](https://pingtool.org) revealed the IP is located in China. Next, I set the WAN DNS to [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) instead of the pre-programmed IP, rebooted and it saved the [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) setting after reboot. At least 190 other people bought the router, and it irks me that nearly all of them probably have no idea all their DNS requests are being routed thru China.\n\n### Comment ID i0cmpzd with +5 score by [(DarkWorld25, Reddit, 2022-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/tbthjj/psa_newer_tplink_routers_send_all_your_web/i0cmpzd/) (in reply to ID i0asb8o):\nLmao the manufacturer probably didn't expect that the product would even be exported.

The most that's changed is the company logo on the housing. I have wondered if they're harvesting DNS info for marketing analytics or at the behest of the PRC government.\n\nAdguard DNS is great for sure. However, I like nextdns.io subscription for the analytics/reporting and the fine tune control it has. The next best thing would be a pi-hole; but with nextdns.io, you can use it both at home and on the go. I like to think of nextdns.io as the best combination of Adguard plus comodo secure DNS but with added analytics/reporting and granular control.\n\n## Comment ID i09i4v8 with +11 score by [(cyberintel13, Reddit, 2022-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/tbthjj/psa_newer_tplink_routers_send_all_your_web/i09i4v8/) (in reply to ID tbthjj):\nOne more reason to run your own router with a pfSense box\n\n### Comment ID i09muc0 with +2 score by [(Catnip4Pedos, Reddit, 2022-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/tbthjj/psa_newer_tplink_routers_send_all_your_web/i09muc0/) (in reply to ID i09i4v8):\nCan I run that from a raspberry pi or does it need more power?

It correlates up / down depending on internet traffic. I'll add to this main post.\n\nI have two TP-Link routersP\n\nArcher C4000\n\nArcher AX4400\n\nThe C4000 is retired due to lack of firmware updates.  Got the AX4400 as my first WiFi 6 router.  It's a slightly slower version of the AX73.  The last firmware update was July 11, 2022.  As far as stability, I like TP-Link routers, my main concern was lack of firmware updates.  I replaced the AX4400 with an Asus RT-AX86U, but even as someone who's good with computers, and tech, and has some formal training, the Asus still feels overwhelming with all it's features.  So, I have kept the AX4400 (with updated firmware) as a backup in case I want to go back to a more simple setup.  Also I own a 6th Gen Airport Extreme router, and after doing some research on those, I found from various reports in the Macrumors forums that, they are still secure today, but the main hangup is because they are older hardware, their speed isn't up to modern ISP plans.  (especially over wireless) since it's a first gen WiFi 5 device.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I have two routers as alternatives.  I was also told by people on the smallnetbuilder forums that That I'd probably be more secure with my TP-Link router as Asus is targeted more in attacks.  So far the Asus has been working well, but it can have issues with my smart bulbs.  However, that seems to be pretty much resolved at this point.",

Generate a stack of images using a prompt file and choose one master preset to proceed with.\n4. Scroll down in the list to the 'subtle' versions of that master preset, which has small changes.

Similar to gradV and gradA but based on cosine, then scaling them to 0.25, 0.5 for a gentler effect.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jjrqy2s2qj3c1.png?width=955&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f61b03e1ed9b8fa9660b5f6b882b7854b899732\n\n### Comment ID kbgmkfr with +2 score by [(Luke2642, Reddit, 2023-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kbgmkfr/) (in reply to ID kbgb3ws):\nthere's gotta be a better way to name the master merge weight types?\n\ndoes anyone have any ideas or suggestions?\n\ncould be based on the maths, the symmetry, or their effect?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0s50c1z1k3c1.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=7969f484d157e8651227efdffd64609e6e339ae2\n\n#### Comment ID kbi4oyv with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kbi4oyv/) (in reply to ID kbgmkfr):\nI struggle with memorizing names of things so some sort of nickname, mathname, and description of effect would probably be the ideal pairing for me.\n\nit would look something like this (example is wrong because I'm ignorant, but it's a placeholder):\n\nBayesian, \"start here\", -smoothly blends between style and substance\n\n## Comment ID kbevanw with +4 score by [(Luke2642, Reddit, 2023-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kbevanw/) (in reply to ID 187kuzi):\nI'm looking for suggestions, tips & tricks regarding block merging of the U-Net.\n\nThe table image above shows the various presets available in many block merge tools, but, it is far from being comprehensive.\n\nWhat presets would you like to see?\n\nWhat workflow do you do when merging that you think is unique or powerful?\n\nDo you use add difference or something else to get cool results?\n\nI've generally found:\n\n1. GradV/GradA, Cosine/Reverse Cosine are more useful than all the rest of the presets. Occasionally the hermite - roughly 50/50 with a swish up or down at the start/end are useful.\n2. Often, the presets are too strong on their own. When they're too strong, they need scaling down, to make, for example, 'GradV mild' which starts at 0.5 and drops to 0.\n3. Often, the presets are too weak on their own, and need shifting up or down. A bit like combining WRAP with GradV or Cosine, so it rises to 1 then stays at 1 for the last 5 layers.\n4. Symmetry works well - if you include some weight in e.g OUT8, include some weight in IN3 and it seems to get stronger / more coherent, I guess due to skips.\n5. Smooth bumps work better than adjusting a group of layers to 1 or 0. WRAP/RING etc all need tapering to get coherent merges.\n6. Smoothstep variants are all confusing and don't seem to be particularly useful. If they had more memorable names and some were more symetrical, perhaps they'd be better?\n7. Ideally there would be a visual output, or a spline that you could drag up and down.\n\n### Comment ID kbfbr9d with +1 score by [(ShatalinArt, Reddit, 2023-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kbfbr9d/) (in reply to ID kbevanw):\nTo get a 0.5 merge effect, I use a trick like this.\n\nModel A merge Model B = Model C\n\nI usually use Cosine/Reverse Cosine\n\nThen:\n\nModel A merge Mode C = Model D\n\nModel D - will get a merge effect of about 0.5-0.6\n\n#### Comment ID kbfe4wu with +1 score by [(Luke2642, Reddit, 2023-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kbfe4wu/) (in reply to ID kbfbr9d):\nInteresting, thanks!\n\nSo if I understand, you like cosine/reverse cosine, but you find they're too strong.

Use runtime merge block weights and play with the sliders.\n\nPut a prompt in, set batch to 4 of 512x512 so you can iterate quickly. Fix the seed. Generate the same batch for two different models, two models that look very different, perhaps a cartoon and a photo real.\n\nHowever, you'll also notice the structure changes, the composition of each image in the batch will be different between the two models. Arms legs pose framing etc.\n\nSo, with the seed fixed, set A as cartoon and B as photo real, and slowly increase one slider at a time until you have a model that generates the composition of the original cartoon batch but looks photo real.\n\nWork your way down top to bottom on both sides at once, because the skip connections are really important. That's why FreeU has such a big impact.\n\nYou'll probably notice that the highest 1-5 layers can often be set 50-100% and the lowest 1-3 layers can be set quite high, something like 25% to 50%, but that somewhere in the lower half and middle, it'll be really sensitive for 3-4 layers on both the input and output. Raising those sliders suddenly gives B composition not A. You've identified \"structure\" versus \"detail\" for that pair of models, for that 1 prompt.\n\nIt can vary quite a bit across different prompts, depending on what each model was trained on, similar or different.\n\nFor most of the cartoon versus photoreal models you'll see a kind of approximate hour glass shape on both sides, but it varies enormously with spikes.\n\nYou can then save out that model, and then make softer mixes. Use it with a gradA, gradV, cosine, rev cosine, or flat strength mix with either of the original models to tone it up or down. \n\nHappy merging!\n\n## Comment ID kc3ubqy with +1 score by [(HarmonicDiffusion, Reddit, 2023-12-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kc3ubqy/) (in reply to ID 187kuzi):\nThank you for providing your research here, it has definitely made me think about some things in a new light!\n\n### Comment ID kc42l0m with +3 score by [(Luke2642, Reddit, 2023-12-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kc42l0m/) (in reply to ID kc3ubqy):\nNo problem, hope it is helpful! :-)\n\nAnother thing that helped improve my intuition was the slow process of trying to merge two checkpoints together, using the goal of \"the maximum amount of model 2 without changing X from model 1\"... testing using a batch of a few 512x512 seeds.\n\nX can be structure, colours, style, etc\n\nIt takes about 20 minutes of moving the sliders one at a time, generating and checking, one by one, up to 50%, then if that works, to 75%, but if it messes up the composition, down to 25%, then move on to the next slider.\n\nOnce you're done, if you merge the result in with model 2 at a low strength, like 20%, strength, you'll still get some of X from model 1 in a nice version of model 2 that hasn't been screwed up by a strong merge.\n\nThe thing I haven't figured out yet is how to use add difference more effectively. It's great for adding inpainting to a model but it mostly just screws up models even at low weights, even if you do know what model it was trained from, and use low weights. I'm sure there's more potential there.\n\n#### Comment ID ktiq004 with +1 score by [(HarmonicDiffusion, Reddit, 2024-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/ktiq004/) (in reply to ID kc42l0m):\nwould love to hear anything new you have discovered!  do you have a discord, blog, etc?",

I only did that direct deposit because you get paid 2 days earlier but I'm gonna switch back to capital one. Also, cash app is holding one of my deposits as a gas hold. It's really odd. I received a deposit while pumping gas and now that deposit is being held. Could be totally outside of cash app, but the other transactions from that day at that gas station cleared already. Of course I've filed a complaint with cash app as it doesn't make sense. But no avail. I formerly only used them to send other people's money and to obviously receive money but it was never a major app for me. In fact, I used apple pay more but I switched to Motorola at the end of July for the new Razr so that's part of why I've been using cash up much more frequently now too. \n\nAlso I noticed with my uptick in usage, lots of payments are being put on hold even tho the money is already gone? I've not ever experienced this before with cash app but I will also attribute some of that to my Google wallet.

The amount depends on the company. Usually it's about the cost of a half - full tank of gas. Since you're prepaying they don't know how much gas you're going to put in until you're finished so they put a hold on the funds beforehand. I always pay inside as I find it a bit much that the hold can last 3 - 7 days.\n\n#### Comment ID ls2gu7d with +2 score by [(simba_thegreatest, Reddit, 2024-10-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CashApp/comments/1g49cuh/spread_the_word_to_uninstall/ls2gu7d/) (in reply to ID ls2ek5l):\nIm aware of that but like I mentioned in my post, the other transactions from that day at that gas station have already cleared. I never got fuel with my new deposit but the deposit has a a hold on it as if it were a new transaction at the pump. That didn't happen. I'm confused about it and so is cash app. The gas station was Quick Trip. Holds usually last the time you pump gas. Even when paying at the pump which is why I prefer quick trip. They have a fuel hold of $175 but it literally last the length of you pulling gas. By the time I drive off the hold is gone. It's been 4 days. This isn't a normal hold. BUT I'm attributing this to using Google pay. That's the only way I can make sense of this right now.\n\n### Comment ID ls3qjqi with +2 score by [(SwimOk9629, Reddit, 2024-10-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CashApp/comments/1g49cuh/spread_the_word_to_uninstall/ls3qjqi/) (in reply to ID ls2bo2l):\nit's not cash app that's holding the deposit. don't swipe your card at the pump, always swipe it inside where you are buying other stuff. every gas station does this, its called a hold.\n\n#### Comment ID ls3ve88 with +1 score by [(simba_thegreatest, Reddit, 2024-10-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CashApp/comments/1g49cuh/spread_the_word_to_uninstall/ls3ve88/) (in reply to ID ls3qjqi):\nIdk how many times I need to explain this but, Quick Trip holds last as long as you pump the gas. This is literally why I use that gas station. Fuel holds are over the moment I drive off the lot. The other holds from that same night, were in store purchases. So no this has nothing to do with swiping my card inside or paying at the pump. I use Google pay for literally everything and rarely use a card. I had holds for in store payments at QT that cleared days ago. This hold is the only one there. The hold makes no sense as I was pretty much done refueling when I got the deposit. But this deposit is being held as if it were apart of a new transaction that never occured. It doesn't make any sense. And according to Quick Trip the max they'll hold money is 3 hours. So, not sure why this is happening. But also like the rest of my post says, nearly all my purchases end up as holds or pending transactions even after the money has been removed from the account and the product paid for. This has never happened before and I can only attribute this to Google pay as it's the medium between purchases.\n\n### Comment ID ls2ro2j with +1 score by [(dvyne2, Reddit, 2024-10-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CashApp/comments/1g49cuh/spread_the_word_to_uninstall/ls2ro2j/) (in reply to ID ls2bo2l):\nCapital One will pay you early as well,once your get direct deposit for a couple of months\n\n#### Comment ID ls2utml with +2 score by [(simba_thegreatest, Reddit, 2024-10-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CashApp/comments/1g49cuh/spread_the_word_to_uninstall/ls2utml/) (in reply to ID ls2ro2j):\nGood to know!

FromSoftware is like Black Sabbath. Black Sabbath took a lot of elements from here and there and turned it into something that had never been done before.

One of the Perks of the Various Stances is to Counter Attack.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/kywklfpcc8ad1.gif\n\nNotice that the Enemy's Stepping Attack is immediately countered by a special move.\n\nThat is one of the Special moves from the Stances.\n\nSo while your basic attack is going to be the same, changing stances does allow you to mix up gameplay besides unleashing Heavy Attack.\n\n5. The Heavy Attacks in the Game work differently from other games.\n\nIn most normal actions you'll be mixing light and heavy attacks into every combo.\n\nIn Black Myth, Heavy Attacks requires Attacking Enemies with Light attack/ Perfect Dodges/ Deflecting Projectiles to earn 'Combo Points' which you can spend on Heavy Attacks. These moves also usually does big damage and staggers the Enemy/Boss. You can also Charge up by HOLDING the Heavy Attack button, but this leaves you vulnerable.\n\n#### Comment ID lbeb3mg with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMythWukong/comments/1du54c4/black_myth_is_not_like_xyz_game_you_can_compare/lbeb3mg/) (in reply to ID lbeadph):\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9q5hci0we8ad1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ae1835c2eb92ce4049c7af2b009870261f72267\n\n6.

You can see it from the Steam Page. Part of the Reason why they went with 4 Spells Mapped to RT + The Face Buttons (Y,A,X,B) . The Game has a different philosophy, it's not Monster Hunter where you are going to juggle many different items. It's why the Heal button is mapped to a 'LB'.\n\nThis is all very intentional part of the game design.\n\n### Comment ID lbgymc7 with +2 score by [(Lupinos-Cas, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMythWukong/comments/1du54c4/black_myth_is_not_like_xyz_game_you_can_compare/lbgymc7/) (in reply to ID lbe80ub):\nYou sure light attack is the same regardless of stance? If that's true, that is highly disappointing. I like learning the controls are like your usual action game controls just like DmC / Nioh / Rise of the Ronin / etc. But it's already disappointing to know there's only the staff - if the light attack doesn't change between stances then that's pretty bad.\n\n## Comment ID lbed1tv with +3 score by [(Chosen_UserName217, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMythWukong/comments/1du54c4/black_myth_is_not_like_xyz_game_you_can_compare/lbed1tv/) (in reply to ID 1du54c4):\nI hate when X, Y, are the attack buttons.

I can't stand when attack buttons are on the shoulders, and if I can't change it to X and Y then I'm not likely to play the game.\n\nAt least for melee games. Shooters are the exception - but if you're using a melee weapon, you should be using X and Y imo. Maybe it's just because I started gaming before shoulder buttons exist - but it doesn't make any sense to me for them to not be X and Y.\n\nWhatever the rest of the controls are - X and Y are attack, A is jump, and if there's a block it should be LB, and if there's an aim it should be LT. And if I can't remap to this - I know I'm not going to play it.\n\n### Comment ID lbjyf4p with +1 score by [(thisiskyle77, Reddit, 2024-07-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMythWukong/comments/1du54c4/black_myth_is_not_like_xyz_game_you_can_compare/lbjyf4p/) (in reply to ID lbed1tv):\nAs an old gamer , I always re map attacks to Square and Triangle.

Leadership at all levels should embody the qualities that attract and retain top talent.\n\t•\tEnsure that hiring managers are well-versed in company culture and values. Leaders need to not only understand these principles but also actively model and communicate them.\n\t•\tFoster a culture where employees and candidates feel heard, respected, and valued—this starts with clear communication, mutual respect, and accountability.\n\t•\tCreate structures to encourage and embrace innovation, ensuring employees feel comfortable sharing new ideas without fear of them being dismissed.\n\nFinal Thought:\nSquare and Block have immense potential to lead by example in the fintech industry, and their mission is worth believing in. With its strong foundation, Square has the opportunity to not only excel in financial technology but also set the standard for inclusive, value-driven workplaces. With stronger alignment in leadership, a renewed focus on respect and innovation, and hiring managers who embody these principles, the company could create an even more impactful and inspiring environment for its teams and candidates.",

This lack of openness diminished trust in the process.\n\t•\tInnovation: Suggestions for thinking outside the box during a role-play exercise were dismissed outright, which seemed contradictory to Block’s emphasis on creativity.\n\t•\tKnowledge Gaps: One of the interviewers did not know how to answer when asked how they foster a positive company culture. This is a red flag, as fostering culture is fundamental to a company’s leadership and values.",

The entire company is constantly being reshuffled which has led to product not being prioritized (unless you manage the restaurants platform) and our industry specific competitors are eating us alive\n2. They have a goal to \"go upmarket\" but our product can barely handle a $10 million seller on it's own. Anything more than that, we need a partner to come in to save the day because we can't do our job\n3. Leadership within the org is a \"boys\" club. They all started around the same time and climbed their way to the top. Now, no one is held accountable because they all protect each other. There should have been some significant changes to certain leadership teams (BDR leaders for example) a while ago but instead they shifted the blame to our US Head of Sales and let them go. \n4. Speaking of BDR, they continue to over hire and underdeliver. They think the answer to their problem is to keep hiring people and firing them when they don't hit quota after 3 months. Apparently the org has a goal of closing a certain amount of GPV and we're extremely behind. So instead of focusing on the current reps, they think the easy way out is to keep hiring to get closer to that number.\n5. The product has become incredibly hard to sell. I'm not sure if it's because we are in an election year but this has been the worst year for Square sales.\n6. Leadership continues to say that they are listening to feedback yet it feels like it goes through one ear and comes out the other.",

You still have people who won’t give feedback, are not great at communication, and don’t fully see the value of their assistant. Block did one of the best jobs of managing this, and for the majority of the time we were seen as a significant part of company.\n\nUnfortunately, the head of the EO team has never been an EA herself and relies on the information given to her by her direct leads. These leads were like toxic high school students, they fought with each other, they use their own directs against each other, they blocked promotions, they over shared information that they should not have shared, and there was even an instance where one of them tried to get the other one fired for sharing privy information that she herself had shared with many people. Favoritism, bullying, and promoting people that didn’t deserve to get promoted were all prevalent. It made it very hard to work in collaboration across BUs and so much time and energy was wasted on petty drama. There was zero management training for most managers, and many were not good at feedback or managing their own emotions which spilled out into their directs. \n\nWith the RIF the EO team was gutted, and the change to titles and scope was unreal. There was so much upset but the leads refused feedback, and we were told in a meeting that we had “a choice to work here, so get over it”. The management team left are either in shock, or not very good but they are there through favoritism. Some of the managers who are still there are either compliant to the toxic approach and gossip, or on one lead’s good side, and are too scared to go against her. The few promotions we saw were friends with her and it was so obvious what was going on.\n\n I loved this job, or I thought I did, until this year when the toxicity got to be too much, and it’s so deep in leadership.",

There is a lot of change still settling there. It could turn out well now that there seems to be a bit more intentional corporate structure, but if you are interested in working there, really interview your hiring manager critically. I still believe strongly in the core product offering and wish them success, but it came with A LOT of extra headaches that were not worth it for me. I love solving hard product problems, but when you don't have the support of the organization and your own management to actually achieve that, it was time for me to go.",

They are more interested in playing office politics than in leading the team effectively. Feedback is often ignored or met with hostility.\nHigh Turnover: The company has an extremely high turnover rate, which speaks volumes about the underlying issues. Employees often leave within a year, leading to a lack of continuity and constant training of new hires.\nWork-Life Imbalance: Despite claims of supporting work-life balance, the reality is that you're expected to be available 24/7. Burnout is common, and there's little regard for personal time.\nLack of Growth Opportunities: There is little to no room for growth or career development. Promotions are rare and seem to be based on favoritism rather than merit.",

After the team favorites were promoted the promo rules magically changed. Now you need a \"business need\" for your promotion so you're essentially stuck in your level unless you switch roles or your exec is promoted; I supported some of the worst execs in my EA career at Block, Inc. which is crazy because Block has great people but some of the senior leaders (across the company) aren't so great and are instead super problematic with poor internal reputations. Before the layoffs, politics in the EO department was insane. Some leads give a lot of lip service and will act like they support you and are \"there\" for you but actually aren't. Some leads literally don't respect confidentiality and run their mouths like teenagers in high school.",

Speaking of BDR, they continue to over hire and underdeliver. They think the answer to their problem is to keep hiring people and firing them when they don't hit quota after 3 months. Apparently the org has a goal of closing a certain amount of GPV and we're extremely behind. So instead of focusing on the current reps, they think the easy way out is to keep hiring to get closer to that number.\n5. The product has become incredibly hard to sell.

Favoritism, bullying, and promoting people that didn’t deserve to get promoted were all prevalent. It made it very hard to work in collaboration across BUs and so much time and energy was wasted on petty drama. There was zero management training for most managers, and many were not good at feedback or managing their own emotions which spilled out into their directs. \n\nWith the RIF the EO team was gutted, and the change to titles and scope was unreal.

Leadership at all levels should embody the qualities that attract and retain top talent.\n\t•\tEnsure that hiring managers are well-versed in company culture and values. Leaders need to not only understand these principles but also actively model and communicate them.\n\t•\tFoster a culture where employees and candidates feel heard, respected, and valued—this starts with clear communication, mutual respect, and accountability.\n\t•\tCreate structures to encourage and embrace innovation, ensuring employees feel comfortable sharing new ideas without fear of them being dismissed.\n\nFinal Thought:\nSquare and Block have immense potential to lead by example in the fintech industry, and their mission is worth believing in. With its strong foundation, Square has the opportunity to not only excel in financial technology but also set the standard for inclusive, value-driven workplaces. With stronger alignment in leadership, a renewed focus on respect and innovation, and hiring managers who embody these principles, the company could create an even more impactful and inspiring environment for its teams and candidates.",

This lack of openness diminished trust in the process.\n\t•\tInnovation: Suggestions for thinking outside the box during a role-play exercise were dismissed outright, which seemed contradictory to Block’s emphasis on creativity.\n\t•\tKnowledge Gaps: One of the interviewers did not know how to answer when asked how they foster a positive company culture. This is a red flag, as fostering culture is fundamental to a company’s leadership and values.",

My experience with them was detailed, thorough, and professional, setting a high standard for candidate engagement.\n\t•\tSquare has created groundbreaking products that genuinely help businesses thrive. Being part of a company that prioritizes empowerment and accessibility is inspiring.\n\t•\tDuring the interview process, I encountered a leader who truly embodied the values of empathy, inclusion, and innovation.

      "# [Block, Inc. by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2010-05-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.)\nAmerican financial services company\n\n\"Square, Inc.\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Square (video game company).\n\nBlock, Inc. (formerly Square, Inc.[10]) is an American technology company that provides financial services to consumers and merchants.[11][12][13] Founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey, it is the U.S. market leader in point-of-sale systems.[14][15][16] As of 2023, Block’s services reach 56 million users and 4 million sellers,[17][18] processing $228 billion in payments annually.[4]\n\nBlock's inaugural product Square, launched in 2009, is a point-of-sale system.[14] It allows sellers to accept card payments and manage various operations, including bookings,[19] e-Commerce,[20] inventory,[21] payroll, shift scheduling,[22] banking, and obtaining business loans.[23] Additionally, Block's portfolio includes Cash App, a consumer-focused digital wallet introduced in 2013.[12][24] This wallet allows users to send, receive or save money,[25][26] access a debit card, invest in stocks and bitcoin,[27][28] apply for personal loans,[29] and file taxes.[30] Block also owns Afterpay, a buy now, pay later business;[31] Bitkey, a self-custody bitcoin wallet;[32][33] a hardware business in bitcoin mining;[34][35] and Tidal, a music streaming business.[36]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n2009: Conception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original inspiration for Block's first product \"Square\" occurred to Jack Dorsey in 2009 when his friend Jim McKelvey was unable to complete a $2,000 sale of his glass faucets and fittings because he could not accept credit cards.[37] Co-founders Dorsey—who also co-founded Twitter—and McKelvey began developing the company out of a small office in St. Louis.[38] The name \"Square\" derives from the company's square-shaped card reader product.[39][40]\n\n2010–2014: Early years\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to Forbes, Block, named Square, Inc. then, tested its payment method on 50,000 merchants in the summer of 2010, and was reporting a chargeback rate of less than 0.05 percent.[41] In February 2011, Square was reportedly valued at approximately US$240 million, signing up 100,000 new merchants every month.[42] In April 2011, Square announced that it has secured an investment from Visa.[43] In October 2011, the company stated that it was processing about US$2 billion per year in payments through its \"Square\" card readers, charging 2.75 percent per swipe.[44]\n\nIn 2012, Starbucks and Square announced a partnership that would allow Starbucks to use the Square payment technology to accept payments for coffee. In the same year, Starbucks also reportedly invested in Square at a valuation of US$25 million.[45] Square was handling an annual payment volume of around US$6 billion around that time.[46]\n\nIn 2013, Square launched Cash App, a peer to peer payment service.[26] In October 2014, the company launched the integration of a payroll feature into its Square payment processing system, following the integrations of a merchant cash advance offering, a customer feedback product and an invoicing service into the system.[47]\n\n2015–2020: Initial public offering, growth\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, Square stated that it processed about US$23.8 billion worth of payment volume in 2014.[48] In the same year, the company sold shares in its initial public offering for US$9 per share, giving itself a market capitalization of $2.9 billion.[49]\n\nIn 2018, Vox reported Square as stating that over 7 million people used the Cash App in December 2017. Vox also stated that Cash App was the \"No. 1 free finance app\" in Apple's U.S. iPhone App Store and was \"ahead\" of PayPal and Venmo.[24]\n\nIn October 2020, Square put approximately 1% of their total assets ($50 million) in Bitcoin (4,709 bitcoins), citing Bitcoin's \"potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future\" as their main reasoning.[50] The company purchased approximately 3,318 bitcoins in February 2021 for a cost of around $170 million, bringing Square's total holdings to around 8,027 bitcoins (equivalent to around US$500 million in 2021, around US$481 million as of July 2024).[51]\n\n2021–2022: Name change, acquisitions\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 2, 2021, Square reached an agreement to acquire majority ownership in Tidal. Square paid $297 million in cash and stock for Tidal, with Jay-Z joining the company's board of directors. Jay-Z, as well as other artists who currently own stock in Tidal, will remain stakeholders.[52][53][54]\n\nOn December 1, 2021, Square announced that it would change its company name to Block, Inc. on December 10.[55][56] The change was announced shortly after Dorsey resigned as CEO of Twitter.[57] On December 10, 2021, the name change took effect, and Square, Inc. became Block, Inc.[58] On December 16, less than a week into the rebrand, H&R Block, sued the company for trademark infringement, claiming that the name seeks to confuse customers by misappropriating the Block brand name, which H&R owns.[59] The lawsuit was resolved in April 2023 when the two companies jointly agreed to dismiss the suit.[60]\n\nOn January 31, 2022, Block completed its acquisition of Afterpay, an Australian buy now, pay later (BNPL) lender.[61]\n\n2023–present: Service issues, business realignment\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2023, Afterpay suffered a service issue which led to a sudden reduction in the spending limits for many users. At least 2000 users reported experiencing a difficulty with the service. Afterpay acknowledged the problem and said it was working on a fix.[62] On September 7 and 8, 2023, Square and Cash App experienced outages, affecting thousands of users. Card payment processing, peer-to-peer payments and other transactions were among the impacted operations. On September 8, 2023, Block informed that the service disruptions had been resolved and all systems were operational by the afternoon of that day. It also said the outage was caused by an issue with the company's Domain Name System (DNS), and did not stem from a cyberattack.[63][64] In the following week, Block apologized to its customers and acknowledged “this situation was made more difficult by our communication”. To reduce the risk of a similar outage in future, the company said it had deployed a new set of firewall and DNS server changes, expanded offline payment capabilities so merchants can still accept payments in offline mode, and put in place additional measures.[65] Later in the month, Block said in a regulatory filing that the CEO of its Square business, Alyssa Henry, was set to leave the company in October 2023, and that Jack Dorsey, serving then as the \"Block Head\" and Chairperson, would take on an additional role of \"Square Head\".[66]\n\nIn February 2024, Block reported an annual \"Gross Payment Volume\" of US$228 billion and an annual income of $9.8 million for the year 2023.[4] In April 2024, CNBC reported that Block announced it had finished the development of its own standalone three-nanometer bitcoin mining chip and was in the process of working through the design with a semiconductor foundry. The company was also reported to be developing a \"full bitcoin mining system\", stating that its goal was to both decentralize the supply of bitcoin mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate — a proxy for industry competition and mining difficulty. In this regard, according to CNBC, Block was solving a \"major barrier to entry\" posed by the relative difficulty in sourcing mining rigs, their high prices and unpredictable delivery.[35] In May 2024, the company's Square platform was found to be the market leader in point-of-sale systems in the U.S.[16][15] In July 2024, Block signed a \"large-scale crypto mining hardware pact\", agreeing to supply its chips to bitcoin miner \"Core Scientific\". The company did not disclose financial details of the pact.[34][67] In October 2024, Bitkey appeared in TIME's list of the \"best inventions of 2024\".[68][69] In November 2024, Fortune reported that Block was laying off many employees from its Tidal, TBD and Square services.[70] That same month, Block announced it was \"winding down\" TBD, \"scaling back\" investments in Tidal and focussing its resources on its bitcoin mining initiative as well as Bitkey, while adding that it was \"refining\" its investments based on progress.[71][72] Block changed its stock ticker from SQ to XYZ in January 2025.[73]\n\nSubsidiaries, products, services\n\n[edit]\n\nSquare\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Square (payment system)\n\nSquare is a payments platform that allows businesses to accept card payments and use smartphones or tablets or computers as payment registers for a point-of-sale system (POS).[74][14][75] The platform was founded in 2009 by Dorsey and McKelvey. Square also offers additional features to manage various operations including staff payroll and shift schedules,[22] customer bookings,[19][76] inventory,[21] e-Commerce,[20][77][78] banking and business loans.[23]\n\nIn 2022, a Protocol survey showed that 35% of U.S. small business owners used Square, a higher percentage than its competitors, while also highlighting the POS market's continued fragmentation.[79] In April 2023, Square was reported to have 4 million merchants as its customers.[80][17] Its client base includes small and medium-sized businesses as well as larger ones.[81][13][82] As of 2024, the platform is available in the U.S., Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Republic of Ireland, Spain and the U.K.,[83] and is the U.S. market leader in point-of-sale systems.[16][15]\n\nCash App\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Cash App\n\nLaunched in October 2013, Cash App (formerly Square Cash) is a digital wallet which allows sending and receiving money, investing in stocks or bitcoin, and filing taxes.[12][25][26] In March 2015, the firm introduced Square Cash for businesses, which includes the ability for individuals, organizations, and business owners to use a unique username, known as a $cashtag, to send and receive money.[84] As of 2023, Cash App also offers a savings account and a debit card, and services such as direct deposit and investing in stocks and Bitcoin.[27][28] In March 2023, USA Today reported that Cash App offered a free tax-filing service while cautioning that it didn't accommodate \"every tax situation\" and didn't offer \"live tax support\".[30] In October 2023, it was reported that Cash App also allowed users to borrow up to $200 from the app, and that \"not everyone is an eligible user for this feature\".[29]\n\nCash App has been found to be the preferred payment app among lower-income adults in the U.S.,[85] reporting 56 million \"monthly active users\" as of 2024.[18]\n\nAfterpay\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Afterpay\n\nAfterpay is an Australian digital payment platform in which a bought product can be paid off in four installments. This idea made in 2008 by a then eighteen-year-old Nick Molnar was geared towards millennials and inspired by the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Molnar and Partner/ Co-founder Anthony Eisen launched their platform in 2014 and in four years their product reached a market capitalization of around $3.3 billion. In February 2020, Afterpay was reported to have 3.6 million active customers in the US, 3.1 million in Australia and New Zealand, and 600,000 in the UK. According to ABC News (Australia) in August 2021, Afterpay had operations in the U.S., Canada and New Zealand, as well as in the U.K., France, Italy and Spain as Clearpay.[86] In the same month, Afterpay and Block announced that Afterpay would be acquired by Block.[87] Block paid US$29 billion in stock for the acquisition and the process was finalized in January 2022. Molnar and Eisen continued to lead Afterpay's merchant and consumer businesses following the acquisition.[61][31]\n\nAs of 2023, Afterpay serves 24 million users and 348,000 merchants,[88][89] processing US$27.3 billion in payments annually.[90] It also ranks among the three most-used BNPL services globally.[91]\n\nBitkey\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Bitkey\n\nIn December 2023, Block launched Bitkey, a self-custody Bitcoin hardware wallet, in 95 countries including the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Nigeria, Argentina, Mexico, and India. The wallet allows investors to own, manage and store their Bitcoin without relying on third-party exchanges or custodians. Bitkey includes a mobile app, hardware device, and a set of recovery tools in case the customer loses the phone, their hardware or both. The wallet cannot access or move a customer's Bitcoin without them.[32][33][92] In October 2024, TIME named Bitkey as one of the \"best inventions of 2024\".[68][69]\n\nBitcoin mining system\n\n[edit]\n\nIn April 2024, Block announced it had finished developing its own standalone three-nanometer bitcoin mining chip and was working through the design with a semiconductor foundry. The company reportedly aimed at building a \"full bitcoin mining system\", stating that its goal was to decentralize both the supply of bitcoin mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate.[35] In July 2024, Block signed an agreement to supply its chips to bitcoin miner \"Core Scientific\".[34][67]\n\nTidal\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Tidal (service)\n\nTidal is a high-definition music streaming service with a catalog of over 100 million songs across various genres. It offers both a subscription plan and an ad-supported free plan.[93][94] Originally launched in 2014 by Aspiro, a Norwegian company, Tidal was purchased in 2015 by American rapper Jay-Z for $56 million, reportedly to \"give artists more control over the distribution of their music\".[95][96] At that time, Tidal was available in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Republic of Ireland, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.[93] In 2021, Block took majority ownership of Tidal for $297 million,[36] stating it aimed to find \"new ways for artists to support their work\" and to create \"tools that can help support musicians' businesses\".[97][96] Tidal was then operating in a streaming market dominated by Spotify and others, and was paying \"better royalty rates\" to artists than its rivals including Spotify.[98][97] In May 2023, Wired reported that Tidal's “Direct Artist Payouts” scheme, in which up to 10 percent of a user's subscription fee was delivered to the artists they listened to most, had been discontinued in 2022. According to Wired, the scheme was \"thoughtful\" and supportive of bands and artists, and its closure reduced some of Tidal's market differentiation.[94] In November 2024, Block announced it was \"scaling back\" investments in Tidal after reports emerged that the company was laying off Tidal employees.[71][72][70][99] Block added it was eliminating Tidal's product management and product marketing functions entirely and that Tidal would become a smaller entity, focusing on fewer areas while emphasizing product development.[99]\n\nFinancials\n\n[edit]\n\nSquare received angel investments from Marissa Mayer, Kevin Rose, Biz Stone, Dennis Crowley, Shawn Fanning, MC Hammer, and Esther Dyson.[citation needed] Since then, it has raised several additional rounds of funding:\n\nSeries A funding from Khosla Ventures[100]\n\nSeries B funding from Sequoia Capital[100]\n\nSeries C funding from Kleiner Perkins[100]\n\nSeries D funding from Citi Ventures, Rizvi Traverse Management, and Starbucks[101]\n\nSeries E funding from Goldman Sachs, Rizvi Traverse Management, and GIC Private Limited[102]\n\nThe company's valuation in October 2014 was $6 billion.[103] On November 19, 2015, Square had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial valuation of $2.9 billion, down by more than half from its last valuation in October 2014 at $6 billion. The series E funding shares had different rights than the common shares sold at the IPO, therefore the $6 billion 'valuation' from October 2014 is wrong. Although the firm was yet to make a profit as of 2015 and had lost $420 million since 2012, it had decreased its losses from 44% of revenues to 16% in the six months leading up to its IPO.[104] For the fiscal year 2018, Square reported losses of US$38 million, with an annual revenue of US$3.299 billion, an increase of 49.0% over the previous fiscal cycle.\n\nYear[105] Revenue\n\nin mil.

In May 2020, Square announced that some of its workers would be allowed to be permanent remote workers.[111] As of 2021, although Block's real estate footprint remains intact, they no longer have a designated headquarters location.[2]\n\nFinancing and acquisitions\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2014, Victory Park Capital, an asset management firm, invested in Square Capital.[112] In May 2015, Square Capital raised additional funding, with Victory Park Capital tripling its initial investment.[113] As of 2016, Square had loaned $1 billion to companies through Square Capital since the program's inception.[114] On November 19, 2015, Square Inc. became a public company via an initial public offering.[115][116] On April 19, 2018, Square announced that it had acquired Zesty, a food delivery service that caters to corporate offices.[117][118] On April 26, 2018, Square announced that it would acquire Weebly, a website-building service, for $365 million.[119] In May 2019, Square announced that it had acquired Eloquent Labs, an artificial intelligence startup helping improve the customer service experience.[120]\n\nIn February 2020, Square announced that it had acquired Dessa, a Toronto-based deep learning company.[121] In November 2020, Square announced it was acquiring Credit Karma Tax, a free do-it-yourself tax-filing service, from Credit Karma for $50 million and would make it a part of its Cash App unit.[122] In March 2021, Square announced it was acquiring a significant majority in music streaming platform Tidal for $293 million in a deal of stock and cash.[123] In the same month, Square's Q1 sales surged 266% as transactions jumped amid economic recovery.[124] In August 2021, Square announced its acquisition of Afterpay, a company offering a \"buy now, pay later\" service. Square finalized the $29 billion stock deal on January 31, 2022.[125][61]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nAllegations of illegal activity\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 23, 2023, investment research firm Hindenburg Research disclosed a short position in Block, leading to a 15% drop in the company's shares that day. Hindenburg's accusations of Block included exaggerating user counts, failing to curb fraud and illegal activity on Cash App, and permitting impersonation of high-profile individuals. It also wrote in its report that Block \"embraced predatory offerings and compliance worst practices in order to fuel growth and profit from facilitation of fraud against consumers and the government.\"[126][127]\n\nBlock responded to the allegations in a press release saying, \"We intend to work with the SEC and explore legal action against Hindenburg Research for the factually inaccurate and misleading report they shared about our Cash App business today\".[128]\n\nNBC News reported in May 2024 that prosecutors at the Southern District of New York were examining financial transactions and internal practices at Block, stemming from alleged compliance lapses at its Square and Cash App units. According to the report, the company allegedly failed to collect adequate information from customers, processed transactions involving countries subject to economic sanctions, and processed cryptocurrency transactions for terrorist groups.[129] In November 2024, Block disclosed in its earnings report for July–September 2024 that it was negotiating a potential settlement with several state regulators that had probed the company's anti-money laundering program. Additionally, Block stated it was negotiating a potential settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in matters including those related to Cash App's handling of customer complaints and disputes. The company added it had accrued a liability for estimated amount in connection with each potential settlement and the amount was not material to the company's financial statements as of September 30, 2024.[130][131]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",

(XYZ) Faces Securities Class Action, Regulators Levy Cash App Fines Following Investigations Going Back to Hindenburg Report– Hagens Berman by Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP on 2025-01-31](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/31/3018947/32716/en/Block-Inc-XYZ-Faces-Securities-Class-Action-Regulators-Levy-Cash-App-Fines-Following-Investigations-Going-Back-to-Hindenburg-Report-Hagens-Berman.html)\nSAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Investors in Block, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) n/k/a (NYSE: XYZ) began to learn of potentially adverse information about the company and its Square and Cash App platforms on Mar. 23, 2023, when Hindenburg Research published a scathing report on the company.\n\nAfter a 2-year investigation, which included dozens of interviews with former employees, partners, and industry experts, Hindenburg concluded, in part, that Block had “wildly overstated its genuine user counts” and “[c]ore to the issue is that Block has embraced one traditionally ‘underbanked’ segment of the population: criminals.”\n\nOn February 4, 2024, NBC News reported that federal regulators were probing allegations of two Whistleblowers that Cash App performed inadequate due diligence on its users –including “‘no effective procedure to establish the[ir] identity’” – opening the door to potential money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illegal and illicit activities.\n\nThen, on May 1, 2024, NBC News reported that federal prosecutors were investigating Block due to allegations by a former employee that the Company had engaged in widespread and years-long compliance lapses at its two main units, Square and Cash App. Reportedly, the employee had provided prosecutors with internal Company documents demonstrating that Block had failed to conduct basic due diligence on its customers, that Square had processed thousands of transactions involving countries subject to economic sanctions (including Cuba, Iran, Russia, and Venezuela), and that Block had processed multiple cryptocurrency transactions for terrorist groups.\n\nThese developments have driven the price of Block shares significantly lower.

Then, on Jan. 16, 2025, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) ordered Block to pay $175 million and fix its failures on Cash App user fraud. The CFPB said Cash App attempted to avoid investigative obligations by tricking its users and that Cash App was vulnerable to criminals defrauding users.\n\nFurther related regulatory actions is possible. Block stated in its most recent Form 10-Q quarterly report filed in November, that it “also received inquiries from the SEC and Department of Justice (“DOJ”) shortly after the publication of a short seller report in March 2023. In July 2024, the Company received a follow-on inquiry from the SEC. The Company believes these inquiries primarily relate to the allegations raised in the short seller report, the Company’s compliance and risk practices, and related disclosures. The Company continues to cooperate with both agencies. The Company is unable to predict the likely outcome of these matters and cannot provide any assurance that the SEC or DOJ will not ultimately take legal action against the Company or that the outcome of any such action, if brought, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.”\n\nBlock, Inc.

      "# [Block Changes Ticker to “XYZ” to Give a Holistic Business Appeal by Sheryl Sheth, sheryl-sheth on 2025-01-10](https://www.tipranks.com/news/block-changes-ticker-to-xyz-to-give-a-holistic-business-appeal)\nJack Dorsey-led Block (SQ) is changing its ticker symbol to “XYZ” to give a more holistic business appeal. Block has a dual-listed structure, with its shares trading under the ticker “SQ” on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and under the symbol “SQ2” on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Both the tickers on NYSE and ASX will change and start trading under the symbol “XYZ” on January 21 and 22, respectively.\n\nMaximize Your Portfolio with Data Driven Insights:\n\nLeverage the power of TipRanks' Smart Score, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions.\n\nMonitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with Your Smart Portfolio\n\nThe rebranding efforts aim to bring Block’s diverse financial business under one roof. Block is a fintech company offering financial services under the brands Cash App, Square, Afterpay, and TIDAL. Along with the ticker symbol change, Block also announced the date for releasing its fourth quarter Fiscal 2024 results, to be reported on February 20, after the market closes. Interestingly, in 2021, Dorsey changed the company’s name from “Square” to “Block” to align with his interest in blockchain technology and make it more inclusive of the various businesses.\n\nAnalysts’ Expectations from Block in 2025\n\nRecently, analysts from two leading research firms reviewed their ratings and outlook on Block stock for 2025. Let’s take a quick look at their views:\n\nKBW analyst Sanjay Sakhrani lowered the price target on SQ stock to $100 from $105, implying 15.3% upside potential from current levels. The five-star analyst has a Hold rating on Block as part of his overall outlook for the fintech group. Sakhrani believes that the companies’ December quarter results and outlook for 2025 will be in focus and influence the stock’s movement. Even though macroeconomic headwinds such as currency and fuel prices persist, the analyst is optimistic about consumer spending trends, which have shown improvement since Q3 FY24.\n\nRaymond James analyst John Davis upgraded SQ stock to Buy from Hold and assigned a $115 price target, implying 32.6% upside. Davis is particularly encouraged by Block’s Seller GPV (gross payment volume) growth, which is expected to boost in 2025. He forecasts Seller GPV to return to double-digit figures this year, driven by easing comps, continued sales momentum, international expansion, and innovation in product offerings. Moreover, Davis believes that SQ stock is currently undervalued as compared to its peers and has scope for a recovery over time.\n\nAre Block Shares a Good Buy?\n\nWall Street remains highly bullish about Block stock’s trajectory. On TipRanks, SQ stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 23 Buys, four Holds, and one Sell rating. The average Block price target of $101.15 implies 16.6% upside potential from current levels. In the past year, Block shares have gained 27.8%.\n\nSee more SQ analyst ratings\n\nDisclosure",

    "# Comprehensive Report on Block, Inc. and Square\n\n## Company Overview\n\nBlock, Inc. (formerly Square, Inc.) is an American technology company founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey. It specializes in providing financial services to consumers and merchants, and as of 2023, it serves 56 million users and 4 million sellers, processing approximately $228 billion in payments annually [(Wikimedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.). The company is headquartered in San Francisco and employs over 5,000 people [(Wikimedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n## Product Overview: Square\n\nSquare is Block's flagship product, launched in 2009. It is a point-of-sale (POS) system that enables businesses to accept card payments and manage various operations, including e-commerce, inventory, payroll, and banking [(Wikimedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.). As of 2024, Square is the market leader in POS systems in the U.S., with a reported 4 million merchants using the platform [(Wikimedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Acquisitions and Partnerships\n\nBlock has made several strategic acquisitions to expand its service offerings. Notably, it acquired Afterpay, a buy now, pay later service, for $29 billion in stock, finalizing the deal in January 2022 [(Wikimedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.). Additionally, in March 2021, Block acquired a majority stake in Tidal, a music streaming service, for $297 million [(Wikimedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n### Financial Performance\n\nBlock's financial trajectory has shown significant growth. In 2023, the company reported an annual revenue of $21.9 billion, with a net income of $9.8 million [(Wikimedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.). The company has also seen a steady increase in its Gross Payment Volume (GPV), which is expected to return to double-digit growth in 2025, driven by international expansion and product innovation [(Tipranks, 2025)](https://www.tipranks.com/news/block-changes-ticker-to-xyz-to-give-a-holistic-business-appeal).\n\n### Service Issues and Regulatory Scrutiny\n\nIn 2023, Block faced service outages affecting both Square and Cash App, which led to disruptions in payment processing for thousands of users [(Wikimedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.). The company attributed these outages to issues with its Domain Name System (DNS) and has since implemented measures to prevent future occurrences.\n\nMoreover, Block has been under scrutiny from regulators following allegations of compliance lapses, particularly concerning its Cash App platform. Reports indicate that the company may have failed to conduct adequate due diligence on its users, leading to potential money laundering and other illegal activities [(Hagens Berman, 2025)](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/31/3018947/32716/en/Block-Inc-XYZ-Faces-Securities-Class-Action-Regulators-Levy-Cash-App-Fines-Following-Investigations-Going-Back-to-Hindenburg-Report-Hagens-Berman.html). In January 2025, Block agreed to pay $175 million to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for failures related to user fraud on Cash App [(Hagens Berman, 2025)](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/31/3018947/32716/en/Block-Inc-XYZ-Faces-Securities-Class-Action-Regulators-Levy-Cash-App-Fines-Following-Investigations-Going-Back-to-Hindenburg-Report-Hagens-Berman.html).\n\n## Executive Leadership\n\nJack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, serves as the CEO of Block. Following the company's rebranding, he has taken on additional responsibilities, including overseeing the Square business [(Wikimedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.). Amrita Ahuja serves as the CFO, guiding the company's financial strategy during a period of significant growth and regulatory challenges [(Wikimedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n## Market Position and Future Outlook\n\nBlock's diverse portfolio, which includes Square, Cash App, Afterpay, and Tidal, positions it well within the fintech landscape. Analysts remain optimistic about the company's future, with a consensus rating of \"Strong Buy\" based on recent performance and growth potential [(Tipranks, 2025)](https://www.tipranks.com/news/block-changes-ticker-to-xyz-to-give-a-holistic-business-appeal). The company is also set to change its stock ticker from SQ to XYZ in January 2025, reflecting its broader business strategy [(Tipranks, 2025)](https://www.tipranks.com/news/block-changes-ticker-to-xyz-to-give-a-holistic-business-appeal).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBlock, Inc. has established itself as a leader in the financial services sector through its innovative products and strategic acquisitions. However, it faces challenges related to regulatory scrutiny and service reliability. Prospective candidates and investors should consider both the growth potential and the risks associated with the company's current trajectory."
