      "# [How Emerging Technology Can Aid Displaced Businesses](https://block.xyz/ebrd)\nDisplacement and suffering due to conflict, persecution, and other crises affect millions of people globally. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that, as of 2023, 117.2 million people globally have been forcibly displaced or been made stateless. 1 This is further exacerbated by climate change, which has displaced more than 376 million since 2008. 2 Over 75% of adults living in countries with humanitarian crises remain outside of the formal financial system and struggle to cope financially with shocks and emergencies.3\n\nThe financial exclusion of displaced populations has long been recognised as a particularly complex issue for policy makers to address.4 Challenges compound, including damaged (or non-existent) physical and digital infrastructure, low levels of financial and digital literacy, and a lack of assets to use as collateral for loans to facilitate resumption of business. Additionally, displaced communities are often perceived as high-risk customers because of the difficulty in satisfying Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements, sometimes due to a lack of government-issued identity documents â but also due to unpredictability of incomes or earnings. This lack of access to financial products and services exacerbates other displacement challenges. It makes it difficult for individuals to rebuild their lives and destroys previously thriving businesses that do not have the documentation, or the data needed, to prove their creditworthiness.\n\nDuring times of diaspora and displacement, ethnically concentrated communities in host countries act as support networks, offering economic opportunities and social stability for those starting anew in a different country or city.5 Within these communities, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) become key channels for displaced people to access safe spaces, employment and economic opportunities.\n\nIn emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), MSMEs account on average for some 78% of employment.6 Displaced populations being unable to continue their businesses is detrimental to local and national economies; the lack of opportunity for employment can hinder migrant integration and contributeÂ to other local social problemsÂ such as homelessness.\n\nWhile, in general terms, access to financial services including payments and lending via mobile and digital technologies has grown in recent years, availability varies by country and can, in emerging economies, often rely on legacy infrastructures which can be difficult to access and prone to disruption.\n\nInnovative blockchain-based solutions, including digital assets like Bitcoin and stablecoins, can alleviate these difficulties because they do not rely on legacy financial market infrastructure. Solutions built on novel distributed ledger technology allow them to offer more reliable, affordable, and accessible solutions for displaced entrepreneurs. In the digital assets space, self-custody (i.e. through self-hosted wallets) enables safe cross-border storage and access to assets, empowering individuals and MSMEs to control their funds during conflicts or emergencies without needing physical banks or cash.7 The widely reported use of some of these solutions following Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine demonstrates their utility during a real-life crisis scenario.8\n\nThese solutions have the potential to improve economic security, inclusion, mobility and empowerment for displaced communities and their businesses globally. However, some of the barriersÂ to further take-up of these technologies include regulatory issues, financial education, and connectivity. To that end, public-private partnerships can help these technologies be more widely deployed by helping address some of the barriers to their broader use.\n\nDisplacement and suffering due to conflict, persecution, and other crises affect millions of people globally.

      "# [Partner Profiles: Hannah Brennan â Scarf by Block on 2024-08-15](https://block.xyz/inside/scarfcommunityinterview)\nPartner Profiles is an interview series that spotlights Blockâs community partners â both organizations and individuals â and the work they do to increase access to the economy.\n\nIn this installment of the series, we talk with Hannah Brennan, cofounder and CEO of Scarf, a community organization offering hospitality job training to young refugees and migrants in Australia.\n\nBack in 2010, Hannah Brennan and Jess Moran â two friends and coworkers in Melbourneâs hospitality industry â began working to reduce barriers preventing young refugees and migrants from gaining employment in Australia. While there were jobs to be filled, especially in the hospitality and service industries, roadblocks like hiring discrimination, limited knowledge of employment pathways, and lack of local experience and references kept many in the refugee community from landing work in their new home country. Frustrated by the disconnect, Hannah and Jess launched Scarf â a crash course, of sorts, designed to help newly arrived young people navigate and succeed in Australiaâs hospitality industry.\n\nIn the nearly 14 years since, Scarf has supported close to 350 young people in their journey to gain knowledge, skills, confidence, and networks. Theyâve accomplished this through hands-on hospitality training, mentoring, and paid work experience programs. Scarf graduates become part of a supportive new community â and around three-quarters of them land jobs within six months.\n\nFor this interview we talked with Hannah, Scarfâs cofounder and current CEO, to learn more about Scarfâs history, who the program helps, and how inclusive training and mentoring can break down barriers to the economy.\n\nIn your words, what is Scarfâs mission?\n\nWe exist to create a safe and supportive space for young people seeking asylum, and those from refugee and migrant backgrounds, to learn, make mistakes, be mentored, and begin their working lives in Australia. A big aim for us is to make the [hospitality] industry more equitable and accessible to potential employees. And, ideally, not just the cohorts we work with directly, but more broadly for all young people from migrant, refugee, and asylum-seeking backgrounds so that they're not locked out of jobs.\n\nHow did Scarf start?\n\nIt started just over 14 years ago. I was in my mid-twenties at the time. Iâd been working in hospitality for a few years, and I met Scarfâs other cofounder, Jess Moran, when we were working at a restaurant together. We both had a bit of an interest in giving back to the community and we started doing some volunteer work and meeting with young people from refugee backgrounds. And we found that we were hearing this really similar story: these young people wanted to be working, but no one would give them a shot. They couldnât get an interview.\n\nSo [Jess and I] felt this growing frustration, because we loved the hospitality industry â for us, people born in Australia with some experience working at a cafe or restaurant, it often felt like a very supportive and accessible space. But we were meeting these great people who wanted work but just couldnât get a job. Meanwhile, Jess and I were working at an events space that was desperate for staff. There was this disconnect.\n\nI look back now and think, we were so young and naive. We really didnât grasp how huge these barriers to work were for these young people. We came at it with this sort of simplistic lens of, âThere's a job here, thereâs a person here, but the person is locked out of it. That's not fair and we want to change that.â\n\nDid you and Jess have much experience in community development at that point?\n\nWe didnât. But I think thatâs one of the strengths of Scarf, that there was a lot we didnât know and we were really hopeful that we could change the status quo. And I speak for myself now â Jess will always be a cofounder of Scarf, but she stepped out of the organization in about the third year and moved on to study and other work in the community sector â Iâm still learning. Iâm still figuring out what good community development looks like, and I donât call myself a professional in that sense. Iâm a hospitality professional. But there are a lot of amazing and experienced people who have really helped the program develop over the years and get better and better.\n\nThese days the program is run by a small but mighty team of professionals who are smart, creative, and experienced, but we still welcome input from mentors, supervisors, board members, and beyond. And we have input from Graduate Voice, a group which is made up of young people whoâve gone through our program, and who advise us on how to make Scarf as practical, culturally safe, and valuable as possible for future trainees.\n\nCan you walk me through how the Scarf program works for participants?\n\nWe ran our pilot program back in 2010 with eight trainees. And basically, neither Jess or I have an education background. But we know hospitality. So we thought, okay, what are the key things someone would need to know to be able to walk into a cafe or restaurant and hit the ground running? We realized the training didnât need to be in depth â trainees didnât need to be experts on wine or coffee, but they did need to know how to properly pour a glass of wine and make a decent espresso coffee. So we basically just came up with a program and said, okay, weâll meet once a week and train for a few hours. And at the end of each weekly training session, we ran a dinner service in a friendâs restaurant that was closed â a lot of the customers were friends and family, and we had some donated stock from a friend who worked at a wine company or a local coffee roaster. Some of our really good friends that weâd made in hospitality came on board as mentors â pairing a trainee with a mentor has always been key in the program. The mentor is someone whoâs worked in hospitality for at least five years. Theyâre passionate about it and ready to share their skills to really help build a young personâs confidence just through walking alongside them as they train and as they serve real customers, which can be quite intimidating in the beginning. One of our graduates once described their mentor as âa friendly shadow.â\n\nThat pilot program was by no means perfect. Weâve done a lot of evaluation work and the program has evolved so much since then, and I think it just gets better every year. Weâre constantly asking trainees for feedback and gathering evidence of whatâs working well, what could be better. And I think thatâs another strength. Weâre like, the program is good, better than good, but it could always be better.\n\nHow does Square play into your training?\n\nWhen we go to a partner venue to run a Scarf event, we need to set up our own mini restaurant within that space. And we want to make the simulation as realistic as possible for the trainees. So the trainees learn how to use Square tools, and then during our events they actually use the products during service to input orders and take payments from diners. Itâs important that our graduates come out of the program knowing how to use the technology they are going to be working with in future hospitality jobs.\n\nWhat was Scarfâs initial purpose, and how did it evolve?\n\nIn the early days it was very much about training and jobs. We didnât really understand the part we played in creating a safe space for people who were new to Australia, who often had things going on in their lives that you canât see just by looking at them. Things that created almost insurmountable barriers to employment.\n\nWe have incredible trainers and mentors and we have a really specific way of inducting people, working within a trauma-informed framework, and making sure the program is a very welcoming space. As much as Scarf is about hospitality and learning and work, I would say itâs equally about community, connection, and creating friendships. Itâs about being a really integral part of someoneâs life as theyâre settling into a new country.\n\nPartner Profiles is an interview series that spotlights Blockâs community partners â both organizations and individuals â and the work they do to increase access to the economy.\n\nIn this installment of the series, we talk with Hannah Brennan, cofounder and CEO of Scarf, a community organization offering hospitality job training to young refugees and migrants in Australia.\n\nBack in 2010, Hannah Brennan and Jess Moran â two friends and coworkers in Melbourneâs hospitality industry â began working to reduce barriers preventing young refugees and migrants from gaining employment in Australia.

She understood that running a nonprofit is not for the faint of heart. CJ thought her calling was in the private sector. With degrees from UCLA, UC Berkeley School of Public Health, and Columbia University's Graduate School of Business, CJ had a background in real estate and a passion for deals, not nonprofits. But as she learned more about the organization and their plans for a hub in the neighborhood she grew up in, she realized it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. âWhat I came to understand,â she said, âis that this is a movement.\n\nIn 2019, CJ served as the Executive Director of the East Oakland Black Cultural Zone Collaborative and as the founding CEO of the Black Cultural Zone Community Development Corporation, a role sheâs held since 2020. As Executive Director, CJ led a coalition of Black residents, leaders, organizers, and advocates to keep a place for Black culture in a 50-square-block area in East Oakland. As CEO, CJ started and led an emerging community development corporation with a plan to build ten Black Cultural Zone hubs in East Oakland, partner with the collaborative to build a thriving community in East Oakland, and connect this movement with other Black Cultural destinations nationwide.\n\nEarlier this year, CJ and the BCZ collaborated with Block, Inc. (formerly Square, Inc.) to launch Uptown Market. The market is a retail space for vendors from Oaklandâs cultural markets, located on the ground floor of Blockâs downtown Oakland offices at 1955 Broadway. CJ talked to us from New Orleans (where she was attending a conference) about the Rise East Plan and commitment for East Oakland, her role with the BCZ, her vision for the Uptown Market, and more.\n\nBLOCK: What is the Black Cultural Zone? Whatâs the mission of the organization?\n\nCJ: The Black Cultural Zone is actually three things. Itâs a geographic area from High Street in Oakland to the border of the cities of San Leandro and Oakland, from the hills to the water. It's a community development corporation, and it's a collaboration of organizations that support the vision of the Black Cultural Zone. And so what that vision is, in Oakland, is for our legacy Black community to remain, return, and rise in a thriving area that honors, elevates, and protects our legacy and future in the town we love.\n\nI was born and raised in Oakland. In the late seventies, Oakland's population was 51 percent African-American, due primarily to redlining. Then the crack epidemic hit, predatory lending and subsequent foreclosures, and recently, the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. All kinds of things have led to our community being less than 20 percent [of the Oakland population] and projected to be less than 10 percent by 2040.\n\nAnd so we said, âWe need a Black Cultural Zone to anchor our presence in Oakland.\" That's how it got started. [We] really focused on commercial corridors, thinking that if you have business here and jobs here, people can afford to stay. And so I joined in 2019 with my real estate development background. What we envision is that there will be a Black cultural area in this legacy city that will keep the memory of Black people, and hopefully retain and return a strong presence of Black people in this legacy area of East Oakland. Our vision doesnât exclude other cultural groups, which, if you know Oakland, we love our cultural diversity. We just want to make sure we shall remain.\n\nThere are cultural zones all over this country that celebrate and elevate ethnic communities like Little Italy, Chinatown â people are used to that. But there has not been a safe, protected, and thriving Black Cultural Zone that celebrates our culture similarly in America. The history of African-Americans, it's different. We don't have the traditional immigrant story.\n\nBLOCK: What is a typical day for you as CEO of the Black Cultural Zone?\n\nCJ: On the move! After the BCZ was founded, it grew from three people to nearly 40 people. Now I spend more of my time looking outwards and building alliances, bringing in funding, and supporting our stakeholders, and also tend to the team that manages our programs.\n\nBLOCK: Tell me about Uptown Market and how that collaboration with Block came to be.\n\nCJ: Block has supported our economic development work. Again, I realized that we can't just build a marketplace without a pipeline of entrepreneurs; we have to incubate entrepreneurs who are able to sustain an actual brick-and-mortar presence. So, we started something called the AKOMA Market during the pandemic. We expanded that to taking those vendors on the road to festivals around Oakland.\n\nSo we'd been talking about a hub. [Block] asked if we'd be interested in using that space at Uptown Station to incubate and bring the best of Oakland cultural market vendors to that space. And it was like, absolutely! It gives our vendors an opportunity to see what it's like to have to get in at seven, and close at seven. [Editorâs note: Uptown Marketâs holiday hours are Wednesday through Friday, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.]\n\nBLOCK: Whatâs the response been since Uptown Market opened?\n\nCJ: From customers, they're always amazed when they come in. It's such a beautiful space. It's so colorful and lively and we have a mix of retail and food, which gives people a reason to come. And we have events. So it's an experience. Youâve got to get people out of the house after the pandemic. It's a different world. The sellers are excited to be there.\n\nBLOCK: As an East Oakland native, talk to me about the impact you've seen your work have?\n\nCJ: I think the best way I can describe it is believing. The site in East Oakland called Liberation Park used to be a part of a thriving mall complex when I was younger, which ultimately became a police station. And then they abandoned it and it was overrun with weeds. And now we have created an oasis. And I think when people would hear me say, âWe're going to have this roller-skating rink and outdoor movies at this abandoned site which was an eyesore,â they'd be like, âShe is out of her mind.â And now it's there.\n\nPartner Profiles is an interview series that spotlights Blockâs community partners â both organizations and individuals â and the work they do to increase access to the economy.\n\nIn the inaugural installment of the series, Carolyn Johnson, CEO of Black Cultural Zone, talks to us about Oakland's Uptown Market and more.\n\nWhen Oakland nonprofit EastSide Arts Alliance told Carolyn Johnson, known to colleagues and friends as âCJ,â that they were looking to hire an Executive Director for the East Oakland Black Cultural Zone Collaborative, she did not hesitate to suggest other people for the job.

      "# [Square, Inc. Changes Name to Block by Block on 2021-12-01](https://block.xyz/inside/press-release-block)\nSquare, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) announced today that it is changing its name to Block. Block will be the name for the company as a corporate entity. The Square name has become synonymous with the companyâs Seller business, which provides an integrated ecosystem of commerce solutions, business software, and banking services for sellers, and this move allows the Seller business to own the Square brand it was built for.\n\nThe change to Block acknowledges the companyâs growth. Since its start in 2009, the company has added Cash App, TIDAL, and TBD54566975 as businesses, and the name change creates room for further growth. Block is an overarching ecosystem of many businesses united by their purpose of economic empowerment, and serves many peopleâindividuals, artists, fans, developers, and sellers.\n\nThe name change to Block distinguishes the corporate entity from its businesses, or building blocks. There will be no organizational changes, and Square, Cash App, TIDAL, and TBD54566975 will continue to maintain their respective brands.

Made up of Square, Cash App, Spiral, TIDAL, and TBD54566975, we build tools to help more people access the economy. Square helps sellers run and grow their businesses with its integrated ecosystem of commerce solutions, business software, and banking services. With Cash App, anyone can easily send, spend, or invest their money in stocks or Bitcoin. Spiral (formerly Square Crypto) builds and funds free, open-source Bitcoin projects.

TBD54566975 is building an open developer platform to make it easier to access Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies without having to go through an institution.\n\nSquare, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) announced today that it is changing its name to Block. Block will be the name for the company as a corporate entity. The Square name has become synonymous with the companyâs Seller business, which provides an integrated ecosystem of commerce solutions, business software, and banking services for sellers, and this move allows the Seller business to own the Square brand it was built for.\n\nThe change to Block acknowledges the companyâs growth. Since its start in 2009, the company has added Cash App, TIDAL, and TBD54566975 as businesses, and the name change creates room for further growth. Block is an overarching ecosystem of many businesses united by their purpose of economic empowerment, and serves many peopleâindividuals, artists, fans, developers, and sellers.\n\nThe name change to Block distinguishes the corporate entity from its businesses, or building blocks. There will be no organizational changes, and Square, Cash App, TIDAL, and TBD54566975 will continue to maintain their respective brands. A foundational workforce, which includes teams such as Counsel, People, and Finance, will continue to help guide the ecosystem at the corporate level. As a result of the name change, Square Crypto, a separate initiative of the company dedicated to advancing Bitcoin, will change its name to Spiral.\n\nThe name has many associated meanings for the company â building blocks, neighborhood blocks and their local businesses, communities coming together at block parties full of music, a blockchain, a section of code, and obstacles to overcome.\n\nSquare, Inc. is referred to as âBlockâ in this press release.

The only downside of .xyz is, that its by default considered SPAM because a lot of people registered numeric .xyz and used it to SPAM the shit out of it, because they cost like a dollar per year.

Just today I got a text from a sender who claimed to be the US Postal Service about some package from outside the country being held up in customs.  The link that the text message instructed me to follow was \"us-usps-*jibberish*-.xyz/i\"   I am going to state here that any time the domain seems odd, its most likely a scam or phishing attempt.  The US Postal service has a domain that they use for everything so it seems like a no-brainer.  DO NOT click it or copy/paste, etc.   Now with that said, it's not simply a problem of any business using .xyz, but it is a problem with a sender claiming to be someone I do transact with asking me to follow a link to a domain that has a questionable address/URL.\n\nI am sure I am not the first to warn you about this kind of thing.\n\nCarry on and stay safe my friends.

Compare it to an electric field. If you are in between two plates of a capacitor, the individual point charges that surround you create a uniform electric field orthogonal to the plates. This is the same theoretical effect that can happen with gravity. \n\nImagine that the Minecraft world is flat (which it pretty much is), and there is a very large and dense plane of matter below the surface creating a gravitational field. This gravitational field is uniform (this is due to the fact that the plane of the earth is practically infinite in size in relation to the player). For all intents and purposes of the game, this gravitational field would be practically the same as if the player was on a spherical planet with a center of gravity. The only case where this representation is flawed is when dealing with other VERY large bodies of mass, such as planets, but there are no other planets in Minecraft. \n\nEffectively, the earth in this game is never in a frame of reference in which the planet itself is treated as a point charge, or point mass... I guess ;), so the center of gravity is essentially a non-factor.\n\n#### Comment ID dxtoem5 with +3 score by [(oscillating000, Reddit, 2018-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/8e5jeb/mind_blowing_explanation_as_to_why_1_block_in_the/dxtoem5/) (in reply to ID dxt1jw0):\nPick a point on the map, then move in a single direction.

For starters you could imagine that the source of gravity is a plane existing on a negative Y value. If you think further you'll come to a point where you notice that even this model doesn't work anymore, since gravity doesn't change for very high Y as it should. There is no escape velocity, so gravity in Minecraft is actually a force that affects you in the same way and amount no matter where in X Y Z you are.*\n\nThis also is the reason why your theory that the Minecraft world is spherical doesn't work. A sphere with a central source of gravitational force has an escape velocity. Minecraft doesn't.\n\n\\* Unsurprisingly that's how gravity works in the game engine/source code.\n\n## Comment ID dxsrafd with +198 score by [(yodathegiant, Reddit, 2018-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/8e5jeb/mind_blowing_explanation_as_to_why_1_block_in_the/dxsrafd/) (in reply to ID 8e5jeb):\nI didn't realize that this was mind blowing, I thought it was common sense. You can look *physically* at the game to see that there is void below bedrock in the overworld and in the nether, but if you look within the confines of the game without cheating, you find bedrock at the bottom of the overworld, and at the top of the nether with no way to pass between them. Since Minecraft is basically supposed to be earth (or some other planet, that's unimportant), *thematically* it's obvious that the nether is supposed to be closer to the center of the earth, and that's why you travel \"faster\" in the Nether, and when you portal up it places you 8 times further than you've traveled. \n\nYou can talk about how the game is coded, but ultimately there's a void below bedrock because of programming limitations.

With infinite (if you don't have the Farlands) surface area, radius, etc., except it doesn't go to the centre of the sphere.\n\nObviously this implies an infinitely large sphere, but that's why you can't physically go between the Overworld and the Nether, because the distance between their depths is also infinite.\n\nAnd here's the beautiful thing about this: every MC world can exist on the surface of the same infinite sphere. They never intersect, because it's infinite, but they're all there.\n\nAs to the End: apparently every one of the 128 End portals connects to just one portal in the End, so rather than being above the Overworld, the End is just further below the Nether, infinitely far below it. The End portal is at the point of the 'sector', which isn't really a sector because the point isn't at the centre of the sphere, but is at some point above the centre, given that each world's End is different.\n\nThis does mean that the sun & moon are travelling infinitely fast around the sphere (or the sphere's rotating infinitely fast around its axis), which does admittedly make me feel uncomfortable, but I can live with that.\n\nI do think that the sun & moon complicate things somewhat, as iirc, they travel across the sky directly overhead, which means they're both at an infinite distance from the sphere to make any travelling distance of the player negligible to their positions in the sky. And it's possible that instead of a sphere, the multiverse is a cylinder, with every world lined up, where the sun & moon rise on each world one after the other.\n\n## Comment ID dxtfday with +2 score by [(CounterSkil, Reddit, 2018-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/8e5jeb/mind_blowing_explanation_as_to_why_1_block_in_the/dxtfday/) (in reply to ID 8e5jeb):\nCheckmate Flat Earthers\n\n## Comment ID dxtj923 with +2 score by [(implicature, Reddit, 2018-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/8e5jeb/mind_blowing_explanation_as_to_why_1_block_in_the/dxtj923/) (in reply to ID 8e5jeb):\nSolution: Minecraft world is flat but [non-Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_half-plane_model)\n\n## Comment ID dxsl0vt with +3 score by [(PlatinumAltaria, Reddit, 2018-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/8e5jeb/mind_blowing_explanation_as_to_why_1_block_in_the/dxsl0vt/) (in reply to ID 8e5jeb):\nSeveral errors:\n\n1) The Minecraft world is objectively not round, its blocks are adjoined at 90° to each other.

It's a flat plain.\n\nYou could easily do similar on the face of the earth. With no more materials/tools than those available in minecraft for testing/measuring purposes (to get perfect cubes), you could indeed create a line of cubes that would wrap around the planet. And the minecraft \"sphere\" would be much bigger and closer to a flat surface.\n\nIn short, you have no in-world evidence that minecraft blocks are precisely 90 degrees AND that the gaps between them are consistent.\n\n> Underneath the Overworld is the Void, exactly what you see in the game.\n\nThis is also problematic. Only having overworld or nether loaded could be easily explained as the same reason chunks are loaded all the way out to the border. With the addition that crossing this border doesn't trigger loading because you're supposed to use portals to cross the bedrock so as to drastically reduce loaded blocks.\n\n3, I can agree with. It would make significantly more sense to have a nether 8 times smaller than the overworld and therefor the 1-to-8 mechanic could be explained by curving or stretching space. As it is, a portal at 0,0 links to a portal 0 blocks away while a portal at 30,000,000 links to one 26,250,000 away. Interestingly, I expected a nether portal at 30000000 to crash the game.\n\nStill, it's a game. It's wherever they say it is. All the theories on the internet won't convince either way without canon lore.\n\n#### Comment ID dxutytv with +1 score by [(PlatinumAltaria, Reddit, 2018-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/8e5jeb/mind_blowing_explanation_as_to_why_1_block_in_the/dxutytv/) (in reply to ID dxut09j):\n> You could easily do similar on the face of the earth.\n\nNo you couldn't. Take for instance railway tracks. They're made out of straight pieces of metal, right? Wrong, the tracks actually bend slightly (under gravity) to conform with the Earth's curvature. Minecraft blocks don't do this, they're perfect cubes all the time, and no curve is seen over all 60,000,000 square metres of the playable surface.\n\n>you have no in-world evidence that minecraft blocks are precisely 90 degrees\n\nThe model of the block is a perfect cube...\n\n>that the gaps between them are consistent.\n\nActually outside the edges of the world the apparent positions of blocks get skewed.\n\nThe only way your claim here would be correct is if spacetime itself were curved, which it probably isn't.\n\n### Comment ID dxsuuyv with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/8e5jeb/mind_blowing_explanation_as_to_why_1_block_in_the/dxsuuyv/) (in reply to ID dxsl0vt):\n1.

Bedrock is also placed on top of the pillars in the End, I presume you don't think those are tiny Overworlds? The bedrock is just there to bound the world, it doesn't mean that every piece of bedrock is the same position.\n\n4. Yes, I understand that in the real world it's a hardware limitation.

Vacuum definitely doesn’t have infinite mass. Then force is zero. Then vacuum doesn’t dispense. The vacuum cannot dispense.\n\n### Comment ID ffnas9m with +5 score by [(Denie7, Reddit, 2020-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftCommands/comments/eu8xs1/i_made_a_vacuum_dispenser/ffnas9m/) (in reply to ID ffna9rc):\nOr can it?\n\n#### Comment ID ffpd1sn with +3 score by [(bruhmoment3163, Reddit, 2020-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftCommands/comments/eu8xs1/i_made_a_vacuum_dispenser/ffpd1sn/) (in reply to ID ffnas9m):\nspot on answer\n\n### Comment ID ffpd3bw with +2 score by [(bruhmoment3163, Reddit, 2020-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftCommands/comments/eu8xs1/i_made_a_vacuum_dispenser/ffpd3bw/) (in reply to ID ffna9rc):\nwell you see it dis-a-pensin don’t ya!\n\n### Comment ID ffpedic with +2 score by [(ssolisv12, Reddit, 2020-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftCommands/comments/eu8xs1/i_made_a_vacuum_dispenser/ffpedic/) (in reply to ID ffna9rc):\nWhat did you just see, Miner_ChAI, what did you just see!?",
      "# Post ID 1bcntlv: Beacon range clarification with +3 score by [(Z010X, Reddit, 2024-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalminecraft/comments/1bcntlv/beacon_range_clarification/)\nMy understanding is the full power beacon is 50 blocks from the center that creates a square perimeter. My other understanding is that is within the Simulation 4 distance ie 50 < 64. My question is does that mean a sim distance of 4 DIAGNOALLY shuts off the beacon effects? \n\nI put the beacon down at 498, -54, 498. I aligned my base NW corner at 512,64,512. I noticed at 448, 71, 448 I have no effects which is within the distance of the square for a max beacon. Strangely if I goto 480, 71, 448 that works. 464, 71, 448 works too. I then checked 448, 71, 464 and that worked too.\n\nWhat is the issue with 448, 71, 448 not working? I literally have scaffolded a map with 16x16 deep slate lines to check this math (why can't we get an F3 debug on mobile?!)  \n\n## Comment ID kuh8oxs with +4 score by [(Willing_Ad_1484, Reddit, 2024-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalminecraft/comments/1bcntlv/beacon_range_clarification/kuh8oxs/) (in reply to ID 1bcntlv):\nIt does, it sucks, it's dumb. \n\nI had a friend go stand near a beacon for me and them getting close enough to load it gave me the effects too\n\n## Comment ID kuhasdy with +3 score by [(jerri_pi, Reddit, 2024-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalminecraft/comments/1bcntlv/beacon_range_clarification/kuhasdy/) (in reply to ID 1bcntlv):\nUnfortunately this simulation distance will indeed shut off the Beacon effect.\n\nThe simulation distance is a SPHERE centered on your player (foot level afaik) of 64 blocks, while the Beacon range is a SQUARE of 50 blocks from the Beacon.\n\nStanding at the corner 50 blocks in both the X and Z directions from the Beacon (putting you at the last block that should be within Beacon range) you are a distance of 70.7 blocks from the Beacon since the diagonal distance = &radic; ( 50^2 + 50^2 ) , which is greater than the simulation distance of 64.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: math symbols\n\nEdit 2: Simulation distance is a truncated diamond centered on the chunk you are standing in as others have pointed out\n\n### Comment ID kuhhc6z with +3 score by [(Z010X, Reddit, 2024-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalminecraft/comments/1bcntlv/beacon_range_clarification/kuhhc6z/) (in reply to ID kuhasdy):\nThank you for the concise answer.

The outlined chunks (red and blue) are the chunks where the beacon is close enough to have an effect in simulation distance 4. Oddly, it seems that it uses a (taxicab) radius of 5 chunks to determine this, rather than 4 as expected. You can see your test points in the Northwest corner, with black for (448, 448) and green for the two test points that worked.\n\nedit: TIL that sim 4 is actually a *truncated* diamond.

You can see it from the Steam Page. Part of the Reason why they went with 4 Spells Mapped to RT + The Face Buttons (Y,A,X,B) . The Game has a different philosophy, it's not Monster Hunter where you are going to juggle many different items. It's why the Heal button is mapped to a 'LB'.\n\nThis is all very intentional part of the game design.\n\n### Comment ID lbgymc7 with +2 score by [(Lupinos-Cas, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMythWukong/comments/1du54c4/black_myth_is_not_like_xyz_game_you_can_compare/lbgymc7/) (in reply to ID lbe80ub):\nYou sure light attack is the same regardless of stance? If that's true, that is highly disappointing.

I can't stand when attack buttons are on the shoulders, and if I can't change it to X and Y then I'm not likely to play the game.\n\nAt least for melee games. Shooters are the exception - but if you're using a melee weapon, you should be using X and Y imo. Maybe it's just because I started gaming before shoulder buttons exist - but it doesn't make any sense to me for them to not be X and Y.\n\nWhatever the rest of the controls are - X and Y are attack, A is jump, and if there's a block it should be LB, and if there's an aim it should be LT.

It seems that you have been having trouble with the newly added block states for Minecraft bedrock 1.19.70, this is a pre-typed message just to give an outline on how this stuff works since I already know there’s going to be too many people asking about this.\n\nFirst thing I’ll say is if you have a metadata of 0 for your command just replace it with a [] and you’ll be good, now if that isn’t the issue continue reading.\n\nNow, why were block states added? Because java also has them, and they wanted to have bedrock be more similar to Java so that java players can switch over to bedrock (which makes more money), and also probably because they were sick of people that kept asking for nbt.\n\nAs for why your command isn’t working, it is because the old system (metadata) has been replaced with a better one, aka block states, these are basically, well, the states that a block can be in. A good example of this can be seen below:\n\n```\nsetblock ~~~ stained_glass[“color”:”green”]\n```\n\nWhich will, as you would guess, set the defaulted position’s block to green stained glass. If you are wondering how one would get the block states you can go visit the following link (just make sure you use the ones labeled under bedrock edition):\n\nhttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Block_states\n\nThere can also be multiple block state arguments on one block, such as the “wood” block, in this case you would just separate it with a comma, an example of this is shown below:\n\n```\nsetblock ~~~ wood[“pillar_axis”:”z”,”stripped_bit”:true,”wood_type”:”spruce”]\n```\n\nNow, you might’ve noticed “hey, this won’t work, the true isn’t incased in quotation marks1!!1!!1!” and to that I say, very nicely observed, but you’re wrong, for true and false boolean and integer (aka number) inputs you do not put quotation marks because they are not string inputs.\n\nNow this should cover pretty much everything but you’re free to ping/reply to this if you still have SPECIFIC questions :D.\n\n### Comment ID jc9r0mt with +2 score by [(Haunting-Rent-4126, Reddit, 2023-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftCommands/comments/11rhbvk/11970_fill_command_changed/jc9r0mt/) (in reply to ID jc8x6m4):\nThanks. **I'll keep on trying.**\n\n### Comment ID jcaizu9 with +1 score by [(Artistic-Ad-3315, Reddit, 2023-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftCommands/comments/11rhbvk/11970_fill_command_changed/jcaizu9/) (in reply to ID jc8x6m4):\nIf i want to fill big walls with cut sandstone what is the command because /fill xyz xyz sandstone 2 doesn’t recognise “2” anymore.

I worked with a few horrible ones. \nInsane amount of middle management layers. Gossip was a mainstay especially within Executive Operations. Very easy to fall out of someone’s good graces. \nProximity bias is alive &amp; well especially in Exec Ops (i.e. if you go into the offices and pretended to be happy to grab lunches then that catapulted you in the eyes of the leads).

After the team favorites were promoted the promo rules magically changed. Now you need a \"business need\" for your promotion so you're essentially stuck in your level unless you switch roles or your exec is promoted; I supported some of the worst execs in my EA career at Block, Inc. which is crazy because Block has great people but some of the senior leaders (across the company) aren't so great and are instead super problematic with poor internal reputations. Before the layoffs, politics in the EO department was insane. Some leads give a lot of lip service and will act like they support you and are \"there\" for you but actually aren't. Some leads literally don't respect confidentiality and run their mouths like teenagers in high school.",

They are more interested in playing office politics than in leading the team effectively. Feedback is often ignored or met with hostility.\nHigh Turnover: The company has an extremely high turnover rate, which speaks volumes about the underlying issues. Employees often leave within a year, leading to a lack of continuity and constant training of new hires.\nWork-Life Imbalance: Despite claims of supporting work-life balance, the reality is that you're expected to be available 24/7. Burnout is common, and there's little regard for personal time.\nLack of Growth Opportunities: There is little to no room for growth or career development. Promotions are rare and seem to be based on favoritism rather than merit.",

After the team favorites were promoted the promo rules magically changed. Now you need a \"business need\" for your promotion so you're essentially stuck in your level unless you switch roles or your exec is promoted; I supported some of the worst execs in my EA career at Block, Inc. which is crazy because Block has great people but some of the senior leaders (across the company) aren't so great and are instead super problematic with poor internal reputations.

Likely unintentional, but not a good look, Square.\n\n6 months prior to the huge layoff, upper management had made vague announcements about upcoming layoffs, but with no specifics.

      "# [Block, Inc. by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2010-05-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.)\nAmerican financial services company\n\nThis article is about the parent company. For the business-facing financial services it operates, see Square (financial services).\n\n\"Square, Inc.\" redirects here. For the video game company, see Square (video game company).\n\nBlock, Inc. (formerly Square, Inc.[9]) is an American technology company offering financial services to consumers and businesses.[10][11][12] Founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey, it leads the U.S. point-of-sale systems market.[13][14][15] As of 2023, Block serves 56 million users and 4 million businesses,[16][17] processing $228 billion in payments annually.[3]\n\nBlock's inaugural product Square, launched in 2009, is a point-of-sale system.[13] It allows businesses to accept card payments and manage operations, including bookings,[18] e-Commerce,[19] inventory,[20] payroll, shift scheduling,[21] banking, and obtaining business loans.[22] Additionally, Block's portfolio includes Cash App, a consumer-focused digital wallet service introduced in 2013.[11][23] This service allows users to send, receive or save money,[24][25] access a debit card, invest in stocks and bitcoin,[26][27] apply for personal loans,[28] and file taxes.[29] Block also owns Afterpay, a buy now, pay later service;[30] Bitkey, a self-custody bitcoin wallet service;[31][32] and Tidal, a music streaming service.[33]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n2009: Conception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original inspiration for Block's first product \"Square\" occurred to Jack Dorsey in 2009 when his friend Jim McKelvey was unable to complete a $2,000 sale of his glass faucets and fittings because he could not accept credit cards.[34] Co-founders Dorsey—who also co-founded Twitter—and McKelvey began developing the company out of a small office in St. Louis.[35] The name \"Square\" derives from the company's square-shaped card reader product.[36][37]\n\n2010–2014: Early years\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to Forbes, Block, named Square, Inc. then, tested its payment method on 50,000 merchants in the summer of 2010, and was reporting a chargeback rate of less than 0.05 percent.[38] In February 2011, Square was reportedly valued at approximately US$240 million, signing up 100,000 new merchants every month.[39] In April 2011, Square announced that it has secured an investment from Visa.[40] In October 2011, the company stated that it was processing about US$2 billion per year in payments through its \"Square\" card readers, charging 2.75 percent per swipe.[41]\n\nIn 2012, Starbucks and Square announced a partnership that would allow Starbucks to use the Square payment technology to accept payments for coffee. In the same year, Starbucks also reportedly invested in Square at a valuation of US$25 million.[42] Square was handling an annual payment volume of around US$6 billion around that time.[43]\n\nIn 2013, Square launched Cash App, a peer to peer payment service.[25] In October 2014, the company launched the integration of a payroll feature into its Square payment processing system, following the integrations of a merchant cash advance offering, a customer feedback product and an invoicing service into the system.[44]\n\n2015–2020: Initial public offering, growth\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, Square stated that it processed about US$23.8 billion worth of payment volume in 2014.[45] In the same year, the company sold shares in its initial public offering for US$9 per share, giving itself a market capitalization of $2.9 billion.[46]\n\nIn 2018, Vox reported Square as stating that over 7 million people used the Cash App in December 2018. Vox also stated that Cash App was the \"No. 1 free finance app in Apple's U.S. iPhone App Store\" and was \"ahead\" of PayPal and Venmo.[23]\n\nIn October 2020, Square put approximately 1% of their total assets ($50 million) in Bitcoin (4,709 bitcoins), citing Bitcoin's \"potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future\" as their main reasoning.[47] The company purchased approximately 3,318 bitcoins in February 2021 for a cost of around $170 million, bringing Square's total holdings to around 8,027 bitcoins (equivalent to around US$500 million in 2021, around US$481 million as of July 2024).[48]\n\n2021–present: Name change, acquisitions\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 2, 2021, Square reached an agreement to acquire majority ownership in Tidal. Square paid $297 million in cash and stock for Tidal, with Jay-Z joining the company's board of directors. Jay-Z, as well as other artists who currently own stock in Tidal, will remain stakeholders.[49][50][51]\n\nOn December 1, 2021, Square announced that it would change its company name to Block, Inc. on December 10.[52][53] The change was announced shortly after Dorsey resigned as CEO of Twitter.[54] On December 10, 2021, the name change took effect, and Square, Inc. became Block, Inc.[55] On December 16, less than a week into the rebrand, H&R Block, sued the company for trademark infringement, claiming that the name seeks to confuse customers by misappropriating the Block brand name, which H&R owns.[56] The lawsuit was resolved in April 2023 when the two companies jointly agreed to dismiss the suit.[57]\n\nOn January 31, 2022, Block completed its acquisition of Afterpay.[58]\n\nOn September 7 and 8, 2023, Block's Square and Cash App experienced outages, affecting thousands of users. Card payment processing, peer-to-peer payments and other transactions were among the impacted operations. On September 8, 2023, Block informed that the service disruptions had been resolved and all systems were operational by the afternoon of that day. It also said the outage was caused by an issue with the company's Domain Name System (DNS), and did not stem from a cyberattack.[59][60] In the following week, Block apologized to its customers and acknowledged “this situation was made more difficult by our communication”. To reduce the risk of a similar outage in future, the company said it had deployed a new set of firewall and DNS server changes, expanded offline payment capabilities so merchants can still accept payments in offline mode, and put in place additional measures.[61] Later in the month, Block said in a regulatory filing that the CEO of its Square business, Alyssa Henry, was set to leave the company in October 2023, and that Jack Dorsey, serving then as the \"Block Head\" and Chairperson, would take on an additional role of \"Square Head\".[62]\n\nIn February 2024, Block reported an annual \"Gross Payment Volume\" of US$228 billion for the year 2023.[3] In May 2024, the company's Square platform was found to be the market leader in point-of-sale systems in the U.S.[15][14] In November 2024, Fortunte reported that Block was laying off many employees from its Tidal, TBD and Square services.[63] That same month, Block announced that it was \"winding down\" TBD as the company shuffled resources toward other cryptocurrency-focused ventures and that it was \"scaling back\" investments in Tidal. Block added it was refining its investments based on progress.[64]\n\nSubsidiaries, products, services\n\n[edit]\n\nSquare\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Square (payment system)\n\nSquare is a payments platform that allows businesses to accept card payments and use smartphones or tablets or computers as payment registers for a point-of-sale system (POS).[65][13][66] The platform was founded in 2009 by Dorsey and McKelvey. Square also offers additional features to manage various operations including staff payroll and shift schedules,[21] customer bookings,[18][67] inventory,[20] e-Commerce,[19][68][69] banking and business loans.[22]\n\nIn 2022, a Protocol survey showed that 35% of U.S. small business owners used Square, a higher percentage than its competitors, while also highlighting the POS market's continued fragmentation.[70] In April 2023, Square was reported to have 4 million merchants as its customers.[71][16] Its client base includes small and medium-sized businesses as well as larger ones.[72][12][73]\n\nCash App\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Cash App\n\nLaunched in October 2013, Cash App (formerly Square Cash) is a digital wallet which allows sending and receiving money, investing in stocks or bitcoin, and filing taxes.[11][24][25] In March 2015, the firm introduced Square Cash for businesses, which includes the ability for individuals, organizations, and business owners to use a unique username, known as a $cashtag, to send and receive money.[74] As of 2023, Cash App also offers a savings account and a debit card, and services such as direct deposit and investing in stocks and Bitcoin.[26][27] In March 2023, USA Today reported that Cash App offered a free tax-filing service while cautioning that it didn't accommodate \"every tax situation\" and didn't offer \"live tax support\".[29] In October 2023, it was reported that Cash App also allowed users to borrow up to $200 from the app, and that \"not everyone is an eligible user for this feature\".[28]\n\nIn February 2024, Block reported 56 million \"monthly active users\" for Cash App.[17]\n\nAfterpay\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Afterpay\n\nAfterpay is an Australian digital payment platform in which a bought product can be paid off in four installments. This idea made in 2008 by a then eighteen-year-old Nick Molnar was geared towards millennials and inspired by the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Molnar and Partner/ Co-founder Anthony Eisen launched their platform in 2014 and in four years their product reached a market capitalization of around $3.3 billion. In February 2020, Afterpay was reported to have 3.6 million active customers in the US, 3.1 million in Australia and New Zealand, and 600,000 in the UK. In August 2021, Afterpay and Square announced that Afterpay would be acquired by Square.[75] Block paid US$29 billion in stock for the acquisition and the process was finalized in January 2022.[58][30] Although Afterpay is now owned by Block inc., Molnar and Eisen still spearhead Afterpay's merchant and consumer businesses.\n\nTidal\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Tidal (service)\n\nTidal is a digital music streaming service that gives users access to over 80 million songs from genres and artists across the world.[76] Tidal was founded on the basis of artists getting paid rightfully for their work, meaningfully and directly instead of through traditional means. Tidal was first launched in 2014 by a Norwegian company called Aspiro. Aspiro was purchased by Jay-Z in 2015 for $56 million.[77] In early 2017, the Sprint Corporation purchased 33% of the company for $200 million and then in 2021 Square Inc. paid $297 million for a majority ownership of the company.[33] Tidal now operates in 61 countries worldwide.[76] In June 2022, through the disclosure of the Annual Stockholder Meeting 2022, Block reported that the stake acquired in the Tidal music service was 86.8%.[78]\n\nBitkey\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Bitkey\n\nIn December 2023, Block launched Bitkey, a self-custody Bitcoin hardware wallet, in 95 countries including the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Nigeria, Argentina, Mexico, and India. The wallet allows investors to own, manage and store their Bitcoin off exchanges. Bitkey includes a mobile app, hardware device, and a set of recovery tools in case the customer loses the phone, their hardware or both. The wallet cannot access or move a customer's Bitcoin without them.[31][32]\n\nFinancials\n\n[edit]\n\nSquare received angel investments from Marissa Mayer, Kevin Rose, Biz Stone, Dennis Crowley, Shawn Fanning, MC Hammer, and Esther Dyson.[citation needed] Since then, it has raised several additional rounds of funding:\n\nSeries A funding from Khosla Ventures[79]\n\nSeries B funding from Sequoia Capital[79]\n\nSeries C funding from Kleiner Perkins[79]\n\nSeries D funding from Citi Ventures, Rizvi Traverse Management, and Starbucks[80]\n\nSeries E funding from Goldman Sachs, Rizvi Traverse Management, and GIC Private Limited[81]\n\nThe company's valuation in October 2014 was $6 billion.[82] On November 19, 2015, Square had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial valuation of $2.9 billion, down by more than half from its last valuation in October 2014 at $6 billion. The series E funding shares had different rights than the common shares sold at the IPO, therefore the $6 billion 'valuation' from October 2014 is wrong. Although the firm was yet to make a profit as of 2015 and had lost $420 million since 2012, it had decreased its losses from 44% of revenues to 16% in the six months leading up to its IPO.[83] For the fiscal year 2018, Square reported losses of US$38 million, with an annual revenue of US$3.299 billion, an increase of 49.0% over the previous fiscal cycle.\n\nYear[84] Revenue\n\nin mil.

Hindenburg's accusations of Block included exaggerating user counts, failing to curb fraud and illegal activity on Cash App, and permitting impersonation of high-profile individuals. It also wrote in its report that Block \"embraced predatory offerings and compliance worst practices in order to fuel growth and profit from facilitation of fraud against consumers and the government.\"[105][106]\n\nBlock responded to the allegations in a press release saying, \"We intend to work with the SEC and explore legal action against Hindenburg Research for the factually inaccurate and misleading report they shared about our Cash App business today\".[107]\n\nNBC News reported in May 2024 that prosecutors at the Southern District of New York were examining financial transactions and internal practices at Block, stemming from alleged compliance lapses at its Square and Cash App units.

Bitkey, the self-custody bitcoin wallet built by Block, Inc. (NYSE: SQ), launched today in more than 95 countries across six continents, widening access to self-custody and empowering people around the world to truly own and manage their bitcoin easily and safely. Today, the vast majority of the millions of bitcoin owners keep their bitcoin in the custodial platforms or exchanges where they bought it, leaving them under the control of the custodian. Accessing self-custody solutions where people can truly own the keys to their bitcoin still often relies on a complex set of devices or long passwords that people need to remember to be able to recover their money in case of loss.\n\nBitkey includes a mobile app, hardware device, and a set of recovery tools in case the customer loses the phone, their hardware, or both. Built by the Proto team at Block, Bitkey is now available for pre-orders at bitkey.world, with shipping starting in early 2024. Thomas Templeton, who leads the Proto team, said:\n\nEase of use and peace of mind\n\nA critical part of making self-custody more accessible is providing forgiving recovery experiences that prioritize both simple and secure paths to help customers recover their money when something goes wrong, without the burden of having to remember long passwords. According to Lindsey Grossman, Business Lead for Bitkey:\n\nâPeople holding bitcoin on exchanges and custodial platforms today are often hesitant to move to self-custody wallets because they are nervous about making mistakes, especially with the historical requirement that you must safely guard 12 or 24-word long passwords called âseed phrasesâ. People have often felt stuck: worried about the lack of control they might experience on a custodial platform or exchange, yet also anxious about the unforgiving product experiences that exist in other self-custody wallets historically available. With Bitkey, we wanted to build a product that helps bring everyone to self-custody, combining robust security and recovery options, with a simple customer experience that puts them in control of their money.â\n\nBitkey addresses this with a unique 2-of-3 multi-signature design that doesnât require customers to remember long passwords or seed phrases: it uses three keys to secure bitcoin, and any two keys working together are needed to move bitcoin or approve other security-related actions like initiating recovery or modifying security settings.\n\nBitkey puts two keys in customersâ hands: one is in the mobile app, which enables customers to make bitcoin transactions easily on their mobile phone, track their balance, and manage security preferences; and the second customer-held key is in the hardware device, securely stored offline. The hardware key serves two main purposes: an extra layer of security to co-sign money movements (based on a customer-set limit); and enables recovery when customers lose their phone.\n\nA third key is on Bitkeyâs server and is used for only two things: to help customers move bitcoin with just their phone for the transactions they choose to make on the go without their hardware device, and to help customers recover their wallet if they lose their phone or hardware - or even both. Importantly, because Bitkey only has access to one, not two or three keys in this 2-of-3 multi-signature wallet, Bitkey cannot access or move a customerâs bitcoin without them. This puts customers in true control of their money, while giving them peace of mind that they can recover their money if they lose something (for more information on how Bitkeyâs 2-of-3 multi-signature design and recovery tools works, read âHow it works pageâ).\n\nHelping bring more bitcoin to self-custody\n\nPart of Bitkeyâs mission relies on connecting people across two worlds: the world of todayâs domestic or regional centralized fiat monetary systems, and bitcoinâs distributed, borderless financial system. In June 2023, coinciding with the kick-off of the external beta program that launched that month, Bitkey announced its first two partnerships with Coinbase, a leading global exchange, and Cash App, a leading financial services app and part of the Block ecosystem, to help people easily and transfer their bitcoin off exchanges and custodial platforms, making the journey to self-custody easier.\n\nThanks to these partnerships, Bitkey customers are able to choose a partner they would like to transfer or buy bitcoin with and then initiate a transfer from that partner to self-custody in their Bitkey wallet - all through a seamless integration. The transfer and buy+transfer features will roll out in a staggered approach, starting with the ability to transfer existing bitcoin from Coinbase and Cash App available immediately upon the productâs launch. These two partnerships are the first of more to come globally.\n\nAbout Bitkey\n\nBitkey is a self-custody bitcoin wallet with three parts â a mobile app to make transactions easily on the phone, a hardware device to protect savings securely offline, and a set of recovery tools in case customers lose their phone, hardware, or both.

      "# [Utilizing Machine Learning to Catch Social Media Scammers by Block on 2024-09-05](https://block.xyz/inside/utilizing-machine-learning-to-catch-social-media-scammers)\nSocial media has become the most common place for people to fall victim to scams. Thatâs why this year, Cash App rolled out a machine learning-powered tool designed to help customers avoid interactions with potential scammers. We achieve this by identifying and suppressing scam posts that interact with Cash App-related conversations related to our branded posts or social media accounts.\n\nCash App employs a suite of tools designed to protect our customers from fraud before they ever attempt to send a transaction (for example, our Scam Warnings tool we recently shared). Beyond our own platforms, we also take proactive action to limit scammersâ interactions with customers on our social media profiles. We call this our âSocial Media Guardian.â Hereâs how it works:\n\nWe employ a third-party social media monitoring service to identify and assess Cash App related conversations.\n\nThese conversations are ingested into an internal machine learning system that we purpose-built to evaluate whether a post is a scam. If the model is unsure, the post is reviewed manually by a member of our social experience optimization team.\n\nFor our modeling approach, we used BERTweet, which is a public language model pre-trained on X/Twitter data, since our first use case was to detect scams on Twitter. We further tuned BERTweet on our own labeled X dataset to improve the performance.\n\nWhen posts replying to our branded posts are identified as scams, they are hidden and the poster is permanently blocked from interacting with our social media accounts.\n\nUsing this model, weâve been able to identify and suppress with a high degree of accuracy more than 2,000 posts weekly across X and Instagram. That's in addition to the nearly 1,000 posts, on average, we report to X and Instagram each month for terms of service violations and brand impersonation, identified and submitted at scale using an AI-based detection platform. Financial platforms are often the last stop in the lifecycle of a scam, which is why we know itâs crucial that we remain diligent and invest in tools that protect our customers within Cash App and consumers at large.\n\nSocial media has become the most common place for people to fall victim to scams. Thatâs why this year, Cash App rolled out a machine learning-powered tool designed to help customers avoid interactions with potential scammers. We achieve this by identifying and suppressing scam posts that interact with Cash App-related conversations related to our branded posts or social media accounts.\n\nCash App employs a suite of tools designed to protect our customers from fraud before they ever attempt to send a transaction (for example, our Scam Warnings tool we recently shared). Beyond our own platforms, we also take proactive action to limit scammersâ interactions with customers on our social media profiles. We call this our âSocial Media Guardian.â Hereâs how it works:\n\nWe employ a third-party social media monitoring service to identify and assess Cash App related conversations.\n\nThese conversations are ingested into an internal machine learning system that we purpose-built to evaluate whether a post is a scam. If the model is unsure, the post is reviewed manually by a member of our social experience optimization team.\n\nFor our modeling approach, we used BERTweet, which is a public language model pre-trained on X/Twitter data, since our first use case was to detect scams on Twitter. We further tuned BERTweet on our own labeled X dataset to improve the performance.\n\nWhen posts replying to our branded posts are identified as scams, they are hidden and the poster is permanently blocked from interacting with our social media accounts.\n\nUsing this model, weâve been able to identify and suppress with a high degree of accuracy more than 2,000 posts weekly across X and Instagram. That's in addition to the nearly 1,000 posts, on average, we report to X and Instagram each month for terms of service violations and brand impersonation, identified and submitted at scale using an AI-based detection platform. Financial platforms are often the last stop in the lifecycle of a scam, which is why we know itâs crucial that we remain diligent and invest in tools that protect our customers within Cash App and consumers at large.",

      "# [Software Engineer, Business Identities](https://block.xyz/careers/jobs/4140679008)\nSince we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldnât work together.\n\nSo we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions â to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, weâve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.\n\nToday, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes â large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. Weâre building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same. .\n\nThe Role\n\nSquareâs purpose is economic empowerment; since the companyâs beginning, we have been helping numerous people start and manage their own businesses. During the pandemic, many small businesses struggled, as they scramble to adapt to going online to reach their customers.\n\nThe Identity Platform team cultivates trusted relationships with Sellers and businesses across the globe and supports their growth by seamlessly connecting them to the Square ecosystem. We do this by providing authentication and authorization mechanisms and delivering solutions that safeguard access to data while providing account-lifecycle management and session security. We also provide platform solutions for onboarding Sellers to the ecosystem, which includes verification of identity and business data, regulatory screening, qualifying their activation for payment methods, and supporting identity management throughout the lifecycle with Square. We strive to build an Identity platform that empowers both teams at Square and an ecosystem of third party developers.\n\nThis is an opportunity to help build the next generation platform for holistically understanding the real world identity of all participants in the Square ecosystem and beyond. You will be working with a team of highly engaged and passionate individuals on solving a wide range of problems including identity resolution, high availability and low latency and scalable integrations.

      "# [New report highlights opportunities for digital assets to empower businesses in displaced communities](https://www.ebrd.com/news/2024/new-report-highlights-opportunities-for-digital-assets-to-empower-businesses-in-displaced-communities.html)\nNew report by the EBRD and Block, Inc. shows digital assets and blockchain technologies can help support the financial inclusion of businesses in displaced communities\n\nUkrainian entrepreneurs use bitcoin and digital wallets to overcome financial displacement\n\nReport highlights public-private partnerships are needed to improve financial and digital literacy and expand digital financial infrastructure\n\nDigital Assets, including bitcoin and stablecoins, can foster financial inclusion for businesses in displaced communities, according to a new report by Block, Inc. and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).\n\nThe report, published today, addresses the critical issue of financial exclusion among displaced populations worldwide, and highlights the potential of mobile, digital, and digital asset-based financial services to support displaced businesses.\n\nAs the number of forcibly displaced individuals in 2023 reaches 117.2 million globally, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and with more than 376 million people displaced by climate-related disasters since 2008, the need for financial innovations that deliver economic empowerment to displaced communities has never been more pressing.\n\nThe report notes that more than 75 percent of adults in countries experiencing humanitarian crises live outside the formal financial system, leaving them unable to rebuild their lives or businesses, due to the lack of recognised assets or documentation to use as collateral.\n\n\"Displaced populations often face compounded challenges, including being perceived as high-risk by financial institutions due to difficulties in meeting identity requirements and the unpredictability of their incomes,\" the report notes. \"These challenges significantly hinder their ability to access essential financial services, exacerbating their already precarious situations.\"\n\nThe joint report from Block, Inc. and EBRD underscores the potential of digital assets, including bitcoin and stablecoins, to address some of these challenges. Unlike traditional financial systems, blockchain-based solutions do not rely on legacy infrastructure, which can make them more reliable, affordable, and accessible to displaced entrepreneurs. The report emphasises the benefits of self-custody wallets, which enable safe cross-border storage and access to funds, giving individuals and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) control over their assets during conflicts or emergencies - and provides real-life use cases from Ukrainian refugees.\n\n\"The successful use of digital assets following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine provides a powerful example of how these technologies can offer practical support in crisis situations,\" the report states.\n\nMicro, small, and medium sized businesses are highlighted in the report as crucial to economic growth and stability, especially within migrant, displaced, and diaspora communities. In emerging markets and developing economies, MSMEs account for approximately 78 percent of employment.\n\nHowever, the inability of displaced entrepreneurs to access financial services hinders migrant integration and exacerbates social issues such as homelessness.\n\nDespite the promise of these technologies, the report acknowledges the barriers to their widespread adoption, including regulatory challenges, financial education, and connectivity issues. The report advocates for public-private partnerships to overcome these obstacles by improving financial and digital literacy, expanding digital financial infrastructure, and creating enabling regulatory frameworks.\n\nPaul Mortby, Head of EMEA Policy for Block, Inc, stated “Today’s report highlights how emerging technologies and financial innovations can rise to meet some of the biggest challenges faced by nations today. As the number of displaced communities and climate change continues to grow, it is critical that we support the development of financial tools that restore agency and economic empowerment to those impacted, and help them to integrate into their new communities. The potential of emerging bitcoin and stablecoin solutions to help alleviate the challenges faced by displaced populations is significant.”\n\nJacek Kubas, Head of the Digital Hub at the EBRD said: “Innovative technologies such as digital wallets, online payment solutions and blockchain can play a crucial role in supporting unbanked populations and refugee communities. They are already proving invaluable in conflict zones such as Ukraine, where displaced MSMEs rely on them to maintain access to assets and to ensure business continuity. The EBRD is always exploring new ideas and products that could increase SMEs’ financial inclusion, access to finance and a greater integration with new markets, and as we expand into Sub-Saharan Africa, such insights will help guide our work and maximise impact there as well.”\n\nFor more information or to access the full report, please visit block.xyz/ebrd.\n\nBlock, Inc.

      "# [5 Companies Owned by Square (Block) by Matthew Johnston on 2020-12-17](https://www.investopedia.com/companies-owned-by-square-5092655)\nBlock Inc. (SQ), formerly Square, is a financial technology (fintech) company that provides mobile payment solutions. The startup was founded in 2009 by two veteran entrepreneurs, Twitter, Inc. (now X Corp.) co-founder Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey.\n\nBlock Inc. Background\n\nDorsey and McKelvey wanted to enable merchants to accept card payments electronically, a capability that had previously been inaccessible for many businesses. Square was an industry leader in creating technology capable of aggregating merchant services and mobile payments into a single, easy-to-use service.\n\nToday, Block operates both the Square ecosystem (formerly called the Seller ecosystem) and the Cash App ecosystem. The Square ecosystem helps sellers start, run, and grow their businesses by offering a range of tools, including point of sale, virtual terminal, invoice, and other types of business management and financial software.\n\nThe Cash App ecosystem provides financial products and services aimed at helping individuals manage their money. In fiscal year 2023, Block processed a total of $209.6 billion in gross payment volume generated by over four billion card payments. In the same year, the company posted a loss of $21.12 million in net income but $21.92 billion in net revenue. (In fiscal year 2022, the company posted a net loss of $553 million in net income on $17.53 billion in net revenue.)\n\nWhile still a relatively young company, Block has expanded its financial ecosystems over the years through a number of strategic acquisitions. Those acquisitions have helped to boost the company's global operations, diversify its product and service offerings, and expand its reach into next-generation technologies. Among the most recent is Block's acquisition of buy now, pay later company Afterpay in 2022.\n\nBelow, we look in more detail at five of Block's most important acquisitions. The company does not provide a breakdown of how much profit or revenue each acquisition currently contributes.\n\n1. Stitch Labs Inc.\n\nType of Business: Operations Management Software\n\nAcquisition Price: Financial terms not disclosed\n\nAcquisition Date: July 10, 2020\n\nTech startup Stitch Labs was founded in 2011 by Brandon Levey, Jake Gasaway, and Michelle Laham. The company operates a commerce operations management platform, providing businesses with inventory and order management, channel management, and fulfillment solutions.\n\nIn May 2014, Stitch Labs and Square began integrating their separate platforms. The partnership enabled businesses using Square's mobile payments platform to begin tracking inventory, invoices, and shipping information via Stitch Labs' platform.\n\nIn July 2020, Square acquired the startup for an undisclosed amount. Square continued offering Stitch Labs’ products until the spring of 2021, but did not accept new customers during that time.\n\n2. Weebly Inc.\n\nType of Business: Website Building Platform\n\nAcquisition Price: Approximately $272.5 million\n\nAcquisition Date: May 31, 2018\n\nWeebly, a San Francisco-based tech startup was founded in 2007. The company offers a global platform that simplifies for users the process of building a unique website, blog, or online store. Weebly currently serves millions of businesses on over 50 million sites globally.\n\nIn May 2018, Weebly was acquired by Square in a cash-and-stock deal worth $272.5 million. Square said that by combining Weebly’s web-building tools with its own in-person and online offerings, it will be able to provide merchants with the ability to start or expand an omnichannel business. The acquisition was meant to widen Square’s global customer base and provide a new recurring revenue stream.\n\n3. Verse Technologies Inc.\n\nType of Business: Mobile P2P Payments App\n\nAcquisition Price: Financial terms not disclosed.\n\nAcquisition Date: June 15, 2020\n\nVerse Technologies, a Spain-based tech startup offering mobile peer-to-peer (P2P) payment solutions, was founded in 2015. The company’s mobile payment app offers users a simple way to send money to their phone contacts for free. It also allows users to request payments from their contacts and to transfer balances from the app to their bank account.\n\nBy the time Verse was acquired by Square in June 2020, it already had raised $37.6 million of funding from various investors. Prior to the acquisition, Square’s own P2P payment app, named Cash App, was only available in the U.S. and the U.K.\n\nSquare said that its main priority going forward was to enable Verse to continue expanding throughout Europe, allowing it to continue operating as an independent business with no immediate change to current products, customers, or operations.\n\n4. Eloquent Labs\n\nType of Business: Conversational AI Software\n\nAcquisition Price: Financial terms not disclosed\n\nAcquisition Date: May 7, 2019\n\nEloquent Labs, a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) services startup, was founded in 2016 by two top researchers in natural language processing. The company’s software utilizes AI in place of live chat customer support agents employed by ecommerce companies.\n\nEloquent Labs was acquired by Square in May 2019. Square said that Eloquent's AI technology and team will help it to enhance messaging services across its payments ecosystem. Block has since continued to build upon Eloquent Labs' AI capabilities. In February 2020, the firm acquired Dessa, a Canada-based tech company that specializes in the research and development of emerging AI technologies.\n\n5. Third Party Trade LLC\n\nType of Business: Online Brokerage\n\nAcquisition Price: Financial terms not disclosed\n\nAcquisition Date: 2019\n\nThird Party Trade, an Oregon-based online brokerage, was founded in 2015 by Michael Giles. The company provides an application programming interface (API) platform for building investing-related financial applications. Financial media firm Benzinga reported in 2019 that, according to a source familiar with the matter, Third Party Trade was being acquired by Square.\n\nFollowing the acquisition, Third Party Trade was subsequently renamed Cash App Investing LLC, which is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIn October 2019, Square introduced free stock trading on its Cash App, to be administered through the newly formed Cash App Investing LLC.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBlock, Inc., formerly Square, is a fintech company that processes mobile payments. It operates two payment ecosystems. The Square ecosystem helps startups grow their business, while Cash App ecosystem provides financial products to individuals.\n\nBlock made several acquisitions from 2018 to 2023 that allowed it to expand its footprint in the fintech world and create more avenues for acquiring customers. These acquisitions include Stitch Labs, Weebly, Verse Technologies, Eloquent Labs, and Third Party Trade. After being acquired by Block, Third Party Trade was renamed Cash App Investing.",
      "# [TIDAL cuts 40 jobs, shifts its primary focus away from music by Mike_O_Neill (Mike O'Neill), Jim_F (Minimalist), Dennis_Mutsaers (Dennis Mutsaers), Tobias_Imbach (Tobias Imbach), CrystalGipsy (Resisting the flow!), Menzies-Old, Markus_Hubner (Banned), Zarbon (Knut Kosegutt), Dan_Herrmann (Dan Herrmann), OffRode (new user) on 2023-12-06](https://community.roonlabs.com/t/tidal-cuts-40-jobs-shifts-its-primary-focus-away-from-music/258545)\n\"The layoffs come as the US company shifts its primary focus away from music.\n\nOne anonymous source close to TIDAL told RA that this shows the company is making a clear shift from ‘being music-centric to product-centric–pushing tech initiatives instead of anything related to music, labels, distributors or artists.’\"\n\nGreat question. I remember there was a lot of speculation about Jack Dorsey’s motivations for acquiring a failing streaming business in 2021:\n\nTIDAL is owned by former Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s parent fin-tech company Block–now known as Square. Launched in 2009, the multinational conglomerate sells point-of-sale products and apps for processing electronic payments. Dorsey acquired TIDAL from US rap mogul Jay-Z for $297 million in 2021.\n\nMaybe the Tidal “product” that Dorsey was interested in is the royalty settlement system with the labels, especially if it can be repurposed to support more lucrative business models than music streaming which doesn’t really seem to be working for anyone.\n\n2 forgot KKBox , not very useful outside of Asia but there. For me it’s ZERO as Qobuz doesn’t cover South Africa , indeed Africa in general I think.\n\nI must investigate devious ways of getting Apple Music into my system other than Airplay\n\nI’ve had it running in my living room by connecting my MacBook Air to a DAC and from there to my amp. Remote login from my iPad. Cumbersome indeed. I’ve dropped Apple Music in favor of Tidal/Qobuz. But now it’s down to Qobuz as I had already dropped Tidal.\n\nI did pick up Spotify for a 3 month sub for 11 Euro. But not sure if I’ll stay with them. Might be better to reactivate Apple Music and use that next to Qobuz.\n\nI did have Apple Music running by using a lightening cable from an old iPad Mini to my Audiolab M-DAC via USB it worked fine but what a lash up. I must get one of the dual power/lightening camera kits as the mini battery is a bit doubtful\n\nMy current streamer (Naim Uniti Atom HE) has no USB input , why should it it’s a streamer, it has coax and optical so I could use my old (unused M-DAC or unused CXN) as a “bridge” and run coax to the Naim. Or I could simply put up with Airplay 2 which my streamer supports.\n\nFortunately I stream very little but I would miss the Discography function of Roon which only works/shows when you have an active streaming service\n\nIt’s doable if a little messy but I am trying to beat @Jim_F as the minimalist , One Server NUC, One Streamer , several headphones finished.\n\nWell I believe there are a handful of streamers with build in Apple Music app such as the Eversolo. That would work towards your minimalist approach. I’ll be sticking with my Cambridge set of equipment though. AirPray works, but sound quality wise it is less than ideal. The same thing can be said for Spotify. Spotify Connect is a lovely system, but Spotify’s mp3 quality sound is less lovely.\n\nI think the product is TIDAL (and TIDAL Connect), like Spotify wants you to use Spotify (and Spotify Connect). Let’s be optimistic and that the shift to a product centric TIDAL doesn’t mean dropping integration with 3rd parties like ROON too.\n\nI assume the “shift away from music” means dropping all the TIDAL curated playlists (and personnel that makes them). A feature I would not miss, I have more fun with the computer (AI?) generated playlists like Daily Discovery, My Mix, My New Arrivals.\n\nExactly, I wouldn’t be too negative about this neither … Tidal is also seeing itself as a platform for Artists, whatever that means exactly, but I guess it’s still all about publishing and streaming music. It’s becoming more like Spotify.\n\nAnd yes, this is what seems to happen, reading the RA article it looks very much like it’s the journalists/editors that are getting laid off. The Tidal magazine is / was actually high quality content, sad to see it go, same goes for the curated playlists. The algorithm based generated playlists are mostly terrible in my case, as much as everywhere else.\n\nTidals curated stuff was the best for me so that would be a shame to loose that side. I haven’t had it for over a year though. I think it’s safe or they would not have spent so much time and money switching over to flac from MQA if it was going away.\n\nA quick search online for average Tidal salaries is interesting.\n\nNot knowing if these figures I found are accurate or even true, a median of around $95,000 x 40 = $3.8m\n\nGive or take a few $100k, this doesn’t seem a massive saving based on the last revenue figures, again if accurate and true.\n\nThis does show a loss for the Q3 period since 2021.\n\nPlug the loss with a similar sized staff cut saving, and on paper it looks like it did back in 2021\n\nReady for selling maybe.\n\nAs said by others, I see the product as Tidal, Tidal Connect. A model that could be built upon to be equivalent to Roon, maybe.\n\nEyes open on Qobuz now?\n\nOthers like Apple Music, well, losses there could be covered by revenues elsewhere in Apple, maybe .\n\nMy thoughts are that the next 12 months for us using Roon, Tidal and other services will be interesting.\n\nFor the music industry, the artists I think it is more worrying for.\n\nI’m always surprised as to why music labels don’t create streaming services. Full subscription revenue goes to them.\n\nFrom a music lovers perspective, the above could be all wrong as I’m not that well business minded in this industry.\n\nJust food for thought.\n\nI’ve done some more reading on this. Appears to be a move by Jack Dorsey (Block) to cut expenses and increase profit.\n\nFrom the Block 3Q23 shareholder letter:\n\nMoving on to our ecosystem of ecosystems, our focus is to create a dynamic where we are serving different audiences and use cases to increase our total addressable market and to create overall resilience. We are now serving sellers with Square, individuals with Cash App, developers with TBD, and musicians with TIDAL. We believe we can benefit each audience through connected financial tools, and that each business will positively reinforce each other over time.\n\nhttps://investors.block.xyz/overview/default.aspx",

The company has undergone significant changes, including a name change in December 2021 and various acquisitions to expand its ecosystem and product offerings [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n## Financial Performance\n\nAs of October 2024, Block's market capitalization is approximately $44.31 billion, with a trailing P/E ratio of 43.10 and an EPS of 1.67 [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SQ/). In fiscal year 2023, Block reported a revenue of $21.92 billion, although it also posted a net loss of $21.12 million [(Investopedia, 2020)](https://www.investopedia.com/companies-owned-by-square-5092655).\n\n## Product Overview: Square\n\nSquare is Block's flagship product, launched in 2009 as a point-of-sale (POS) system that enables businesses to accept card payments and manage various operational tasks. The platform has evolved to include features for e-commerce, inventory management, payroll, and business loans [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.). \n\nIn 2022, a survey indicated that 35% of U.S. small business owners used Square, highlighting its popularity among small and medium-sized enterprises [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.). As of April 2023, Square had approximately 4 million merchants as customers [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n### Recent Developments\n\n1. **Acquisitions**: Block has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its offerings. Notably, it acquired Afterpay, a buy now, pay later service, for $29 billion in January 2022 [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n2. **New Product Launches**: In December 2023, Block launched Bitkey, a self-custody bitcoin wallet designed to empower users to manage their bitcoin securely. This product aims to simplify the self-custody experience by eliminating the need for complex seed phrases [(Block, 2023)](https://block.xyz/inside/press-release-bitkey-launch).\n\n3. **Service Outages**: In September 2023, Square and Cash App experienced outages affecting payment processing and peer-to-peer transactions. Block attributed the disruptions to a DNS issue and has since implemented measures to prevent future occurrences [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n4. **Leadership Changes**: In October 2023, Alyssa Henry, CEO of Square, announced her departure, with Jack Dorsey taking on additional responsibilities as \"Square Head\" [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n## Partnerships and Collaborations\n\nBlock has engaged in various partnerships to enhance its service offerings.

Reviews highlight management's transparency and the company's commitment to fostering an inclusive environment [(Fortune, 2023)](https://fortune.com/company/square/).\n\n## Challenges and Controversies\n\nBlock has faced scrutiny regarding its compliance practices, particularly concerning allegations of fraud and illegal activity on Cash App. In March 2023, Hindenburg Research accused Block of exaggerating user counts and failing to curb fraudulent activities, leading to a significant drop in stock price [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.). Additionally, regulatory investigations are ongoing regarding the company's financial practices [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBlock, Inc. is a dynamic player in the fintech space, with a robust ecosystem centered around its Square and Cash App products. The company continues to innovate and expand its offerings through strategic acquisitions and new product launches. However, it faces challenges related to compliance and market perception that could impact its future growth. Prospective candidates and investors should consider both the opportunities and risks associated with Block's evolving landscape. \n\nFor more information, visit [Block's official website](https://www.block.xyz)."
