  "summary_markdown": "# About Block\n\nBlock, Inc., formerly known as Square, Inc., is a prominent American technology and financial services company founded on February 1, 2009, by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey. The company is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Block's mission is centered around economic empowerment through innovative financial solutions, and it operates a diverse portfolio of platforms, including Square, Cash App, TIDAL, TBD, and Spiral, each contributing to its goal of enhancing financial accessibility and inclusivity [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/square).\n\nBlock serves a wide range of customers, including individual users, small businesses, and larger enterprises, offering both B2B and B2C services. The company generates revenue through transaction fees, subscription services, and sales of hardware and software solutions. As of 2024, Block serves approximately 57 million users and 4 million sellers, processing $241 billion in payments annually [(Wikimedia, 2010)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\nBlock's products are distributed through various channels, including direct sales, partnerships, and online platforms. The company has evolved significantly over time, expanding its product offerings through strategic acquisitions, such as TIDAL and Afterpay, and focusing on integrating its services to create a seamless financial ecosystem for users [(Wikimedia, 2010)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\nThird parties often describe Block as a leader in the fintech space, particularly in point-of-sale systems, while the company itself emphasizes its commitment to ethical practices and economic empowerment [(Block, 2025)](https://block.xyz/).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Jack Dorsey**: Co-founder and \"Block Head\" (CEO) of Block, Inc. Dorsey is also the Chairperson and has taken on the additional role of \"Square Head\" following leadership changes in 2024 [(Wikimedia, 2010)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n- **Alyssa Henry**: Former CEO of Square, who announced her departure in October 2023 [(Wikimedia, 2010)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n# News\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Acquisitions and Partnerships\n\nBlock has expanded its product offerings through notable acquisitions. In 2021, Block acquired TIDAL, a music streaming service, for $297 million, with Jay-Z joining the board of directors. In January 2022, Block completed its acquisition of Afterpay, a buy now, pay later service, for $29 billion, integrating it into the Cash App and Square ecosystems [(Wikimedia, 2010)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n### Financial Performance\n\nIn Q4 2024, Block reported revenues of $6.03 billion, a 4.5% increase year-over-year, although it fell short of analysts' expectations. The company reported a gross payment volume of $61.95 billion, exceeding estimates, and an adjusted EBITDA of $757 million, reflecting a 34.7% increase from the previous year. Despite these positive indicators, Block's stock experienced volatility, dropping 18% following the earnings report due to concerns over user growth and competition [(Sigalos, CNBC, 2025)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/20/block-xyz-earnings-q4-2024.html); [(Trefis Team, Forbes, 2025)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/02/24/xyz-stock-at-70-time-to-worry-or-opportunity-to-pounce/).\n\n### Leadership Changes\n\nIn September 2024, Block announced a leadership reshuffle, with Alyssa Henry, CEO of Square, set to leave the company in October 2023. Jack Dorsey will assume the additional role of \"Square Head\" [(Wikimedia, 2010)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n## Challenges and Controversies\n\nBlock has faced scrutiny regarding its compliance practices, particularly related to allegations of inadequate user verification on Cash App, leading to investigations by federal regulators. The company has acknowledged these issues and is working to improve its compliance measures [(Hagens Berman, 2025)](https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/block-inc-xyz-securities-class-action).\n\n## Future Outlook\n\nBlock aims to enhance its product offerings and expand its market presence. The company expects to achieve gross profit growth of at least 15% year-over-year in 2025, driven by new product launches and improved customer engagement strategies. Additionally, Block is focusing on integrating its services to create a seamless financial ecosystem for users, which could position it favorably against competitors [(Sigalos, CNBC, 2025)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/20/block-xyz-earnings-q4-2024.html).\n\n## Other News\n\n- Block rebranded Afterpay to Cash App Afterpay in March 2025, further integrating the service into its ecosystem [(Julie Muhn, 2025)](https://finovate.com/block-rebrands-afterpay-to-cash-app-afterpay/).\n- Block subsidiary secured FDIC approval for Cash App Borrow loans in March 2025, allowing the company to offer small, short-term loan products [(Bloomberg News, 2025)](https://bankautomationnews.com/allposts/payments/block-subsidiary-secures-fdic-approval-for-cash-app-borrow-loans/).\n- Block became the first company in North America to deploy the latest NVIDIA GB200 systems for frontier models in March 2025 [(Morningstar, Inc., 2025)](https://www.morningstar.com/news/business-wire/20250312684830/block-becomes-first-company-in-north-america-to-deploy-the-latest-nvidia-gb200-systems-for-frontier-models).\n\nBlock, Inc. continues to navigate the evolving financial landscape, balancing opportunities for growth with challenges related to compliance and competition.",

If you dont know how to figure out where earnings are headed, you are gambling, but its even worse, its like playing blackjack when you dont even know the rules.\n\nEven the smartest people have an incredibly difficult time figuring out where earnings will go, so most people should just buy indexes.  \n\nGambling wouldnt even be fun if you dont understand the rules, and even then it isnt all that fun anyway.\n\n## Comment ID mbbpcat with +29 score by [(tacotruck2112, Reddit, 2025-02-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ij7qq9/should_i_sell_my_xyz_stocks_at_a_loss/mbbpcat/) (in reply to ID 1ij7qq9):\nInvestment decisions are best made looking in front of you, not through the rear window where you came from.

You can sell some of it, try to see if the rest will go up, that way you’re not realizing all the losses but you can free some cash to put in a better place.\n\nTime cost: how long has it been down? How long would it take to recover, if ever? How long could a good fund recoup those losses if you sold and bought something else?\n\n\nThese drastic lump style trades are high risk and for no good reason, be patient and slow. You can sell slowly and move it into a more reliable fund that will presumably see gains, instead of waiting for something to recover to levels it may not go back to in a long time.\n\n### Comment ID mbgun2i with +1 score by [(HopeFox, Reddit, 2025-02-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ij7qq9/should_i_sell_my_xyz_stocks_at_a_loss/mbgun2i/) (in reply to ID mbbsgka):\n>All or nothing: you don’t need to hold all of it or sell all of it.\n\nYou kind of do, though.

Holding on to losers looking for them to rebound is almost always a bad strategy. Actually, come to think of it that applies to life in general not just stocks :)\n\nAnd remember, if you buy a stock at $100 and it drops to $50 that is a 50% loss. But to get back from $50 to $100 isn't a 50% increase, it is a 100% increase. That takes time.

As a whole, they have done well. But again, there are many losers. My worst has a cost basis of $11, and now trades around $0.0011.

In contrast, if you bought some shares of another company for $40 and they later went up to $90, then they're probably worth about $90.\n\nThere is no way to look at the prior history of a stock and use that information to predict its future movements. To the extent that such analysis is possible, smarter and richer people with more information and more supercomputers than you have already done it and captured all of the benefit that can be had from that analysis. All you can do is take the current market price of a stock as its most likely long-term value.\n\nTherefore, if capital gains taxes aren't a concern, there's no reason to sell one stock over another.

The problem with Jack is that he's a low key CEO that doesn't like to be in the public eye and therefore sucks at pumping his own stock. This is where we come in. Time to shed some light on how undervalued BLOCK is. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0jey95tnemde1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fade12885ceee25efd9999c9b81868c4b9fb794\n\nFirst, Block is becoming a player in the bitcoin mining space. They are developing their own chip/rig with Proto. Proto is a suite of bitcoin mining products and services designed to help decentralize the global supply of mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate. Proto works to increase builder access to bitcoin mining chips and rigs while increasing network resiliency and making everyday use of bitcoin secure and simple.\n\nBlock also has \\~8,211 BTC valued at \\~$862M.\n\nTRUMP loves crypto and has recently stated he plans to designate Cryptocurrency as a National Priority. He will enact pro-crypto executive orders on day 1 (that's why BTC is mooning right now).

      "# Post ID 169w5lq: Where do we go with Block Inc (SQ)? with +44 score by [(mjornir, Reddit, 2023-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/169w5lq/where_do_we_go_with_block_inc_sq/)\nBlock Inc’s (formerly known as Square) revenues are now past their peak during the pandemic and have climbed steadily since Q1 2022. However, their net income has remained practically flat during that time. The company seems to be growing, but I don’t have any insight as to why they aren’t profitable yet.\n\nAs for the intangibles, Dorsey as an owner can be characterized as innovative or mercurial, depending on your point of view. He infamously had Block buy Jay-Z’s failed streaming service Tidal for $300 million back in 2021, and has a particular affinity for NFTs/Crypto/the Blockchain. On the flip side, the company itself offers robust and highly popular merchant services through Square as well as Cash App (which is the most used payment service in the world if I remember right).\n\nAll that said, the stock is down to $58 from its ATH in early and again in late 2021 at around $275. Does this stock intrigue you as a buy-low opportunity with potential, or are you staying far away? If you’re bag holding (I am with a small position), what’s your strategy? Personally I like the business, but I think Dorsey’s a bit of a charlatan, so any investment is a gamble on him either staying out of the way or taking a back seat to someone else. So what are your thoughts?\n\n## Comment ID jz5qa4j with +30 score by [(DominatingLobster, Reddit, 2023-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/169w5lq/where_do_we_go_with_block_inc_sq/jz5qa4j/) (in reply to ID 169w5lq):\nI have no idea what to think about Dorsey. His eccentricities created Cash App which is a huge win. But then it also gives you things like Tidal. Personally it’s too hard of a decision for me since Dorsey is so unpredictable. I think I’d sleep better if I could put my money in something I have more certainty in.\n\n### Comment ID jz71md7 with +9 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/169w5lq/where_do_we_go_with_block_inc_sq/jz71md7/) (in reply to ID jz5qa4j):\nHim buying Tidal was one of the most stupid business decisions in business history.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt won't kill his company, and SQ will be fine long term....but Tidal was just such a god damn stupid investment and the app is practically 100% dead at this point.

The higher the strike, the less the call and the less you will make. However, the chances of ending in the money is less as well. So it depends on whether you want yo keep the stock or not. If the stock is something you want yo keep around, set your strike several strikes out of the money. Your weekly return will be less but you’ll keep the stock and can turn around and sell another covered call the next week. You’ll earn anywhere from $130 to as little as $20 each week per 100 shares.

      "# Post ID tam1nx: What Does Everyone See in Block (SQ)? with +57 score by [(marslunar, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tam1nx/what_does_everyone_see_in_block_sq/)\nBlock Stock has an awful risk/reward ratio.\n\nWithout Bitcoin Revenue and Cost of Bitcoin Revenue (A seemingly strange addition to a financial statement), Block has only 7.6b in revenue for FY21. While growth is still seemingly good, gross profit margins are 24.39%, and net margins are 0.93%. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPaypal on the other hand has a 47.38% gross margin and a 16.31% net margin, competing in similar fields (Clover deal for PoS). They are already a 20%+ free cash flow margin machine. Plus, they have an Amazon deal on the way. All the while, they are at 25b in annual revenue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBlock is focused too broadly, and it's becoming increasingly confusing on how to describe Block. Is it a PoS company? A crpyto company? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnterprise Value of PYPL: 128.8B\n\nEnterprise Value of SQ: 71.33B\n\nSeems like everyone has a lot of high hopes for SQ to execute on everything.\n\n## Comment ID i021sl6 with +41 score by [(pippo-rizzo, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tam1nx/what_does_everyone_see_in_block_sq/i021sl6/) (in reply to ID tam1nx):\nIt is all about Ecosystem and who has the best UI. Fintech is a race to the bottom of cost, the most integrated ecosystem and offering superior software and UI. \n\nBlock is ahead of the competition right now including PayPal in being innovative and in tune with what their customers want. They have a vision while most financial institutions are sitting at the board with fatcats trying to maintain the status quo. \n\nMost importantly is the ecosystem and having a full suite of products and services that your customers don’t need to go anywhere else. I think Block is the only one that has that. Profits come later.\n\nEdit: Also 15% back in Bitcoin when you use your cash card at Shake Shack\n\n### Comment ID i04ubq8 with +6 score by [(banditcleaner2, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tam1nx/what_does_everyone_see_in_block_sq/i04ubq8/) (in reply to ID i021sl6):\n15% back in btc sounds great but if its only at some shitty burger joint who cares lmao\n\n#### Comment ID i04wzrg with +8 score by [(pippo-rizzo, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tam1nx/what_does_everyone_see_in_block_sq/i04wzrg/) (in reply to ID i04ubq8):\nEat shitty burgers and get 15% back in btc or eat shitty burgers and don’t\n\nThe choice is yours. \n\nThis is likely just a taste of the benefits that will come from using this ecosystem\n\n### Comment ID i0264jr with +11 score by [(marslunar, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tam1nx/what_does_everyone_see_in_block_sq/i0264jr/) (in reply to ID i021sl6):\nYeah, but what ecosystem do they have built currently? They have cash app and square in its current state, but they’re allocating everything at speculative bets that we have yet to see play out. That screams risk.

And it’s a decade long play at least IMO. \n\nBut all these things are clearly being worked on and coming. Not as pie in the sky as you’d think. And yes they have a very successful existing business model \n\nI can understand your concern.

You have a closed loop.\n\nThis effectively allows transactions to go through at barely any cost and Block takes more profit with the transaction than any other company can.\n\nVisa charge fees and so on.\n\nSo that’s why AfterPay is so exciting cause not does it add more business exposure to both Square as well as 19m uses to cash app.\n\nThe main benefit is that it springs to life the third ecosystem of the overlap.\n\nCash app can directly promote Square sellers within the app like a market place. Whilst Block doesn’t have to worry about % fees.\n\nSo what’s the result?\n\nCash App buyers get a good deal due to a lower cost, Square sellers get a good deal due to a lower transaction fee. In turn, it creates a super fly wheel across both the buyer and seller segments.\n\nPeople will want to join cash app for the deals and businesses will want to join Square to tap into the cash app populace.\n\nClever as hell in my opinion.\n\n### Comment ID i04j0k4 with +7 score by [(marslunar, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/tam1nx/what_does_everyone_see_in_block_sq/i04j0k4/) (in reply to ID i03glnm):\nCan’t PayPal also do the same with Venmo to PayPal?

If one is bullish on the vision of distributed ledger technologies and \"web 3.0 economies\" one is bullish on companies like Block having a short-lived lifespan, sure they serve a great role at the moment, just like Infura does for the Ethereum ecosystem, but that means crypto is not delivering on its \"decentralize all the things\" promise and thus is just a more cumbersome, energy-intensive and inefficient solution that regular databases do infinitely better. \n\nIf you do believe DLT will be adopted in the mainstream over the next 5-10 years, Block should be viewed as a stepping stone towards that, not a foundational piece.

Leadership at all levels should embody the qualities that attract and retain top talent.\n\t•\tEnsure that hiring managers are well-versed in company culture and values. Leaders need to not only understand these principles but also actively model and communicate them.\n\t•\tFoster a culture where employees and candidates feel heard, respected, and valued—this starts with clear communication, mutual respect, and accountability.\n\t•\tCreate structures to encourage and embrace innovation, ensuring employees feel comfortable sharing new ideas without fear of them being dismissed.\n\nFinal Thought:\nSquare and Block have immense potential to lead by example in the fintech industry, and their mission is worth believing in. With its strong foundation, Square has the opportunity to not only excel in financial technology but also set the standard for inclusive, value-driven workplaces. With stronger alignment in leadership, a renewed focus on respect and innovation, and hiring managers who embody these principles, the company could create an even more impactful and inspiring environment for its teams and candidates.",

For example:\n\t•\tEmpathy: Some interactions during the interview process lacked basic engagement and respect, which felt at odds with the company’s commitment to this value.\n\t•\tTransparency: It was evident the position had already been filled before my interview, but this was not communicated. This lack of openness diminished trust in the process.\n\t•\tInnovation: Suggestions for thinking outside the box during a role-play exercise were dismissed outright, which seemed contradictory to Block’s emphasis on creativity.\n\t•\tKnowledge Gaps: One of the interviewers did not know how to answer when asked how they foster a positive company culture. This is a red flag, as fostering culture is fundamental to a company’s leadership and values.",

After the team favorites were promoted the promo rules magically changed. Now you need a \"business need\" for your promotion so you're essentially stuck in your level unless you switch roles or your exec is promoted; I supported some of the worst execs in my EA career at Block, Inc. which is crazy because Block has great people but some of the senior leaders (across the company) aren't so great and are instead super problematic with poor internal reputations. Before the layoffs, politics in the EO department was insane. Some leads give a lot of lip service and will act like they support you and are \"there\" for you but actually aren't. Some leads literally don't respect confidentiality and run their mouths like teenagers in high school.",

After the team favorites were promoted the promo rules magically changed. Now you need a \"business need\" for your promotion so you're essentially stuck in your level unless you switch roles or your exec is promoted; I supported some of the worst execs in my EA career at Block, Inc. which is crazy because Block has great people but some of the senior leaders (across the company) aren't so great and are instead super problematic with poor internal reputations. Before the layoffs, politics in the EO department was insane. Some leads give a lot of lip service and will act like they support you and are \"there\" for you but actually aren't.

Likely unintentional, but not a good look, Square.\n\n6 months prior to the huge layoff, upper management had made vague announcements about upcoming layoffs, but with no specifics.

Leadership at all levels should embody the qualities that attract and retain top talent.\n\t•\tEnsure that hiring managers are well-versed in company culture and values. Leaders need to not only understand these principles but also actively model and communicate them.\n\t•\tFoster a culture where employees and candidates feel heard, respected, and valued—this starts with clear communication, mutual respect, and accountability.\n\t•\tCreate structures to encourage and embrace innovation, ensuring employees feel comfortable sharing new ideas without fear of them being dismissed.\n\nFinal Thought:\nSquare and Block have immense potential to lead by example in the fintech industry, and their mission is worth believing in. With its strong foundation, Square has the opportunity to not only excel in financial technology but also set the standard for inclusive, value-driven workplaces. With stronger alignment in leadership, a renewed focus on respect and innovation, and hiring managers who embody these principles, the company could create an even more impactful and inspiring environment for its teams and candidates.",

This lack of openness diminished trust in the process.\n\t•\tInnovation: Suggestions for thinking outside the box during a role-play exercise were dismissed outright, which seemed contradictory to Block’s emphasis on creativity.\n\t•\tKnowledge Gaps: One of the interviewers did not know how to answer when asked how they foster a positive company culture. This is a red flag, as fostering culture is fundamental to a company’s leadership and values.",

My experience with them was detailed, thorough, and professional, setting a high standard for candidate engagement.\n\t•\tSquare has created groundbreaking products that genuinely help businesses thrive. Being part of a company that prioritizes empowerment and accessibility is inspiring.\n\t•\tDuring the interview process, I encountered a leader who truly embodied the values of empathy, inclusion, and innovation.

(formerly Square, Inc.[12]) is an American technology company and a financial services provider for consumers and merchants.[13][14][15] Founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey, it is the U.S. market leader in point-of-sale systems.[16][17][18] As of 2024, Block serves 57 million users and 4 million sellers,[19][20] processing $241 billion in payments annually.[4]\n\nBlock's inaugural product Square, launched in 2009, is a point-of-sale system.[16] It allows sellers to accept card payments and manage operations, including bookings,[21] e-Commerce,[22] inventory,[23] payroll,[24] banking, and obtaining business loans.[25] Additionally, Block's portfolio includes Cash App, a consumer-focused digital wallet introduced in 2013.[14][26] This app allows users to send, receive, save or borrow money,[27][28][29] access a debit card, invest in stocks and bitcoin,[30][31] and file taxes.[32] Block also owns Afterpay, a buy now, pay later business;[33] Bitkey, a self-custody bitcoin wallet;[34][35] Proto; a bitcoin mining system;[36][37] and Tidal, a music streaming business.[38]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n2009: Conception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original inspiration for Block's first product \"Square\" occurred to Jack Dorsey in 2009 when his friend Jim McKelvey was unable to complete a $2,000 sale of his glass faucets and fittings because he could not accept credit cards.[39] Co-founders Dorsey—who also co-founded Twitter—and McKelvey began developing the company out of a small office in St. Louis.[40] The name \"Square\" derives from the company's square-shaped card reader product.[41][42]\n\n2010–2014: Early years\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to Forbes, Block, named Square, Inc. then, tested its payment method on 50,000 merchants in the summer of 2010, and was reporting a chargeback rate of less than 0.05 percent.[43] In February 2011, Square was reportedly valued at approximately US$240 million, signing up 100,000 new merchants every month.[44] In April 2011, Square announced that it has secured an investment from Visa.[45] In October 2011, the company stated that it was processing about US$2 billion per year in payments through its \"Square\" card readers, charging 2.75 percent per swipe.[46]\n\nIn 2012, Starbucks and Square announced a partnership that would allow Starbucks to use the Square payment technology to accept payments for coffee. In the same year, Starbucks also reportedly invested in Square at a valuation of US$25 million.[47] Square was handling an annual payment volume of around US$6 billion around that time.[48]\n\nIn 2013, Square launched Cash App, a peer to peer payment service.[28] In October 2014, the company launched the integration of a payroll feature into its Square payment processing system, following the integrations of a merchant cash advance offering, a customer feedback product and an invoicing service into the system.[49]\n\n2015–2020: Initial public offering, growth\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, Square stated that it processed about US$23.8 billion worth of payment volume in 2014.[50] In the same year, the company sold shares in its initial public offering for US$9 per share, giving itself a market capitalization of $2.9 billion.[51]\n\nIn 2018, Vox reported Square as stating that over 7 million people used the Cash App in December 2017. Vox also stated that Cash App was the \"No. 1 free finance app\" in Apple's U.S. iPhone App Store and was \"ahead\" of PayPal and Venmo.[26]\n\nIn October 2020, Square put approximately 1% of their total assets ($50 million) in Bitcoin (4,709 bitcoins), citing Bitcoin's \"potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future\" as their main reasoning.[52] The company purchased approximately 3,318 bitcoins in February 2021 for a cost of around $170 million, bringing Square's total holdings to around 8,027 bitcoins (equivalent to around US$500 million in 2021, around US$481 million as of July 2024).[53]\n\n2021–2022: Name change, acquisitions\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 2, 2021, Square reached an agreement to acquire majority ownership in Tidal. Square paid $297 million in cash and stock for Tidal, with Jay-Z joining the company's board of directors. Jay-Z, as well as other artists who currently own stock in Tidal, will remain stakeholders.[54][55][56]\n\nOn December 1, 2021, Square announced that it would change its company name to Block, Inc. on December 10.[57][58] The change was announced shortly after Dorsey resigned as CEO of Twitter.[59] On December 10, 2021, the name change took effect, and Square, Inc. became Block, Inc.[60] On December 16, less than a week into the rebrand, H&R Block, sued the company for trademark infringement, claiming that the name seeks to confuse customers by misappropriating the Block brand name, which H&R owns.[61] The lawsuit was resolved in April 2023 when the two companies jointly agreed to dismiss the suit.[62]\n\nOn January 31, 2022, Block completed its acquisition of Afterpay, an Australian buy now, pay later (BNPL) lender.[63]\n\n2023–present: Business realignment\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2023, Afterpay suffered a service issue which led to a sudden reduction in the spending limits for many users. At least 2000 users reported experiencing a difficulty with the service. Afterpay acknowledged the problem and said it was working on a fix.[64] On September 7 and 8, 2023, Square and Cash App experienced outages, affecting thousands of users. Card payment processing, peer-to-peer payments and other transactions were among the impacted operations. On September 8, 2023, Block informed that the service disruptions had been resolved and all systems were operational by the afternoon of that day. It also said the outage was caused by an issue with the company's Domain Name System (DNS), and did not stem from a cyberattack.[65][66] In the following week, Block apologized to its customers and acknowledged “this situation was made more difficult by our communication”. To reduce the risk of a similar outage in future, the company said it had deployed a new set of firewall and DNS server changes, expanded offline payment capabilities so merchants can still accept payments in offline mode, and put in place additional measures.[67] Later in the month, Block said in a regulatory filing that the CEO of its Square business, Alyssa Henry, was set to leave the company in October 2023, and that Jack Dorsey, serving then as the \"Block Head\" and Chairperson, would take on an additional role of \"Square Head\".[68]\n\nIn February 2024, Block reported an annual \"Gross Payment Volume\" of US$228 billion and an annual income of $9.8 million for the year 2023.[6] In April 2024, CNBC reported that Block announced it had finished the development of its own standalone three-nanometer bitcoin mining chip and was in the process of working through the design with a semiconductor foundry. The company was also reported to be developing a \"full bitcoin mining system\", stating that its goal was to both decentralize the supply of bitcoin mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate — a proxy for industry competition and mining difficulty. In this regard, according to CNBC, Block was solving a \"major barrier to entry\" posed by the relative difficulty in sourcing mining rigs, their high prices and unpredictable delivery.[69] In May 2024, the company's Square platform was found to be the market leader in point-of-sale systems in the U.S.[18][17] In July 2024, Block signed a \"large-scale crypto mining hardware pact\", agreeing to supply its chips to bitcoin miner \"Core Scientific\". The company did not disclose financial details of the pact.[70][71] In September 2024, Block announced a leadership reshuffle, moving many longtime executives into more senior roles and creating a new position focused on customer safety. As part of these changes, Brian Grassadonia, formerly the CEO of Cash App,[72][73] was appointed as the company's new \"ecosystem lead\" to enhance coordination across Block's business sectors.[74]\n\nIn October 2024, Bitkey appeared in TIME's list of the \"best inventions of 2024\".[75][76] In November 2024, Fortune reported that Block was laying off many employees from its Tidal, TBD and Square services.[77] That same month, Block announced it was \"winding down\" TBD, \"scaling back\" investments in Tidal and focussing its resources on its bitcoin mining initiative as well as Bitkey, while adding that it was \"refining\" its investments based on progress.[78][79] The firm changed its stock ticker from SQ to XYZ in January 2025.[80][81]\n\nIn March 2025, Block announced to staff that they had plans to cut almost 1000 employees.[82]\n\nSubsidiaries, products, services\n\n[edit]\n\nSquare\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Square (payment system)\n\nSquare is a payments platform that allows businesses to accept card payments and use smartphones or tablets or computers as payment registers for a point-of-sale system (POS).[83][16][84] The platform was founded in 2009 by Dorsey and McKelvey. Square also offers additional features to manage various operations including staff payroll and shift schedules,[24] customer bookings,[21][85] inventory,[23] e-Commerce,[22][86][87] banking and business loans.[25]\n\nIn 2022, a Protocol survey showed that 35% of U.S. small business owners used Square, a higher percentage than its competitors, while also highlighting the POS market's continued fragmentation.[88] In April 2023, Square was reported to have 4 million merchants as its customers.[89][19] Its client base includes small and medium-sized businesses as well as larger ones.[90][15][91] As of 2024, the platform is available in the U.S., Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Republic of Ireland, Spain and the U.K.,[92] and is the U.S. market leader in point-of-sale systems.[18][17]\n\nCash App\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Cash App\n\nLaunched in October 2013, Cash App (formerly Square Cash) is a digital wallet which allows sending and receiving money, investing in stocks or bitcoin, and filing taxes.[14][27][28] In March 2015, the firm introduced Square Cash for businesses, which includes the ability for individuals, organizations, and business owners to use a unique username, known as a $cashtag, to send and receive money.[93] As of 2023, Cash App also offers a savings account and a debit card, and services such as direct deposit and investing in stocks and Bitcoin.[30][31] In March 2023, USA Today reported that Cash App offered a free tax-filing service while cautioning that it didn't accommodate \"every tax situation\" and didn't offer \"live tax support\".[32] In October 2023, it was reported that Cash App also allowed users to borrow up to $200 from the app, and that \"not everyone is an eligible user for this feature\".[29]\n\nCash App has been found to be the preferred payment app among lower-income adults in the U.S.,[94] reporting 57 million \"monthly active users\" as of 2024.[20][4]\n\nAfterpay\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Afterpay\n\nAfterpay is an Australian digital payment platform in which a bought product can be paid off in four installments. This idea made in 2008 by a then eighteen-year-old Nick Molnar was geared towards millennials and inspired by the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Molnar and Partner/ Co-founder Anthony Eisen launched their platform in 2014 and in four years their product reached a market capitalization of around $3.3 billion. In February 2020, Afterpay was reported to have 3.6 million active customers in the US, 3.1 million in Australia and New Zealand, and 600,000 in the UK. According to ABC News (Australia) in August 2021, Afterpay had operations in the U.S., Canada and New Zealand, as well as in the U.K., France, Italy and Spain as Clearpay.[95] In the same month, Afterpay and Block announced that Afterpay would be acquired by Block.[96] Block paid US$29 billion in stock for the acquisition and the process was finalized in January 2022. Molnar and Eisen continued to lead Afterpay's merchant and consumer businesses following the acquisition.[63][33] In 2024, Molnar was promoted to the role of the \"head of sales\", leading all sales activity at Block while reporting to Dorsey.[97][98][99]\n\nAs of 2023, Afterpay serves 24 million users and 348,000 merchants,[100][97] processing US$27.3 billion in payments annually.[101] It also ranks among the three most-used BNPL services globally.[102]\n\nBitkey\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Bitkey\n\nIn December 2023, Block launched Bitkey, a self-custody Bitcoin hardware wallet, in 95 countries including the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Nigeria, Argentina, Mexico, and India. The wallet allows investors to own, manage and store their Bitcoin without relying on third-party exchanges or custodians. Bitkey includes a mobile app, hardware device, and a set of recovery tools in case the customer loses the phone, their hardware or both. The wallet cannot access or move a customer's Bitcoin without them.[34][35][103] In October 2024, TIME named Bitkey as one of the \"best inventions of 2024\".[75][76]\n\nProto\n\n[edit]\n\nProto is Block's bitcoin mining system.[36][37] In April 2024, the company announced it was building a bitcoin mining system, aiming to decentralize both the supply of bitcoin mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate. The company also said it had finished developing its own standalone three-nanometer bitcoin mining chip and was finalizing the design with a semiconductor foundry.[69] In July 2024, Block signed an agreement to supply its chips to bitcoin miner \"Core Scientific\".[70][71] In February 2025, the company stated it was manufacturing chips with roll out plans later in the year, along with its mining system. The firm also said it was expecting Proto to contribute to Block's business growth in the second half of 2025.[36]\n\nTidal\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Tidal (service)\n\nTidal is a high-definition music streaming service with a catalog of over 100 million songs across various genres. It offers both a subscription plan and an ad-supported free plan.[104][105] Originally launched in 2014 by Aspiro, a Norwegian company, Tidal was purchased in 2015 by American rapper Jay-Z for $56 million, reportedly to \"give artists more control over the distribution of their music\".[106][107] At that time, Tidal was available in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Republic of Ireland, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.[104] In 2021, Block took majority ownership of Tidal for $297 million,[38] stating it aimed to find \"new ways for artists to support their work\" and to create \"tools that can help support musicians' businesses\".[108][107] Tidal was then operating in a streaming market dominated by Spotify and others, and was paying \"better royalty rates\" to artists than its rivals including Spotify.[109][108] In May 2023, Wired reported that Tidal's “Direct Artist Payouts” scheme, in which up to 10 percent of a user's subscription fee was delivered to the artists they listened to most, had been discontinued in 2022. According to Wired, the scheme was \"thoughtful\" and supportive of bands and artists, and its closure reduced some of Tidal's market differentiation.[105] In November 2024, Block announced it was \"scaling back\" investments in Tidal after reports emerged that the company was laying off Tidal employees.[78][79][77][110] Block added it was eliminating Tidal's product management and product marketing functions entirely and that Tidal would become a smaller entity, focusing on fewer areas while emphasizing product development.[110]\n\nFinancials\n\n[edit]\n\nBlock received angel investments from Marissa Mayer, Kevin Rose, Biz Stone, Dennis Crowley, Shawn Fanning, MC Hammer, and Esther Dyson.[citation needed] Since then, it has raised several additional rounds of funding:\n\nSeries A funding from Khosla Ventures[111]\n\nSeries B funding from Sequoia Capital[111]\n\nSeries C funding from Kleiner Perkins[111]\n\nSeries D funding from Citi Ventures, Rizvi Traverse Management, and Starbucks[112]\n\nSeries E funding from Goldman Sachs, Rizvi Traverse Management, and GIC Private Limited[113]\n\nThe company's valuation in October 2014 was $6 billion.[114] On November 19, 2015, Block had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial valuation of $2.9 billion, down by more than half from its last valuation in October 2014 at $6 billion. The series E funding shares had different rights than the common shares sold at the IPO, therefore the $6 billion 'valuation' from October 2014 is wrong. Although the firm was yet to make a profit as of 2015 and had lost $420 million since 2012, it had decreased its losses from 44% of revenues to 16% in the six months leading up to its IPO.[115] For the fiscal year 2018, Block reported losses of US$38 million, with an annual revenue of US$3.299 billion, an increase of 49.0% over the previous fiscal cycle. The company reported $24.12 billion in revenue, $892 million in operating income, $2.9 billion in net income and $240.81 billion in gross payment volume (GPV) for the year 2024. It also stated that it had 11,372 employees, $36.78 billion in total assets and $21.27 billion in total stockholders' equity by the end of the year.[4][5]\n\nYear[116] Revenue\n\nin mil.

In May 2020, Square announced that some of its workers would be allowed to be permanent remote workers.[122] As of 2021, although Block's real estate footprint remains intact, they no longer have a designated headquarters location.[2]\n\nFinancing and acquisitions\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2014, Victory Park Capital, an asset management firm, invested in Square Capital.[123] In May 2015, Square Capital raised additional funding, with Victory Park Capital tripling its initial investment.[124] As of 2016, Square had loaned $1 billion to companies through Square Capital since the program's inception.[125] On November 19, 2015, Square Inc. became a public company via an initial public offering.[126][127] On April 19, 2018, Square announced that it had acquired Zesty, a food delivery service that caters to corporate offices.[128][129] On April 26, 2018, Square announced that it would acquire Weebly, a website-building service, for $365 million.[130] In May 2019, Square announced that it had acquired Eloquent Labs, an artificial intelligence startup helping improve the customer service experience.[131]\n\nIn February 2020, Square announced that it had acquired Dessa, a Toronto-based deep learning company.[132] In November 2020, Square announced it was acquiring Credit Karma Tax, a free do-it-yourself tax-filing service, from Credit Karma for $50 million and would make it a part of its Cash App unit.[133] In March 2021, Square announced it was acquiring a significant majority in music streaming platform Tidal for $293 million in a deal of stock and cash.[134] In the same month, Square's Q1 sales surged 266% as transactions jumped amid economic recovery.[135] In August 2021, Square announced its acquisition of Afterpay, a company offering a \"buy now, pay later\" service. Square finalized the $29 billion stock deal on January 31, 2022.[136][63]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nAllegations of illegal activity\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 23, 2023, investment research firm Hindenburg Research disclosed a short position in Block, leading to a 15% drop in the company's shares that day. Hindenburg's accusations of Block included exaggerating user counts, failing to curb fraud and illegal activity on Cash App, and permitting impersonation of high-profile individuals. It also wrote in its report that Block \"embraced predatory offerings and compliance worst practices in order to fuel growth and profit from facilitation of fraud against consumers and the government.\"[137][138]\n\nBlock responded to the allegations in a press release saying, \"We intend to work with the SEC and explore legal action against Hindenburg Research for the factually inaccurate and misleading report they shared about our Cash App business today\".[139]\n\nNBC News reported in May 2024 that prosecutors at the Southern District of New York were examining financial transactions and internal practices at Block, stemming from alleged compliance lapses at its Square and Cash App units. According to the report, the company allegedly failed to collect adequate information from customers, processed transactions involving countries subject to economic sanctions, and processed cryptocurrency transactions for terrorist groups.[140] In November 2024, Block disclosed in its earnings report for July–September 2024 that it was negotiating a potential settlement with several state regulators that had probed the company's anti-money laundering program. Additionally, Block stated it was negotiating a potential settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in matters including those related to Cash App's handling of customer complaints and disputes. The company added it had accrued a liability for estimated amount in connection with each potential settlement and the amount was not material to the company's financial statements as of September 30, 2024.[141][142]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",

(NYSE: SQ) n/k/a (NYSE: XYZ) began to learn of potentially adverse information about the company and its Square and Cash App platforms on Mar. 23, 2023, when Hindenburg Research published a scathing report on the company.\n\nAfter a 2-year investigation, which included dozens of interviews with former employees, partners, and industry experts, Hindenburg concluded, in part, that Block had “wildly overstated its genuine user counts” and “[c]ore to the issue is that Block has embraced one traditionally ‘underbanked’ segment of the population: criminals.”\n\nOn February 4, 2024, NBC News reported that federal regulators were probing allegations of two Whistleblowers that Cash App performed inadequate due diligence on its users –including “‘no effective procedure to establish the[ir] identity’” – opening the door to potential money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illegal and illicit activities.\n\nThen, on May 1, 2024, NBC News reported that federal prosecutors were investigating Block due to allegations by a former employee that the Company had engaged in widespread and years-long compliance lapses at its two main units, Square and Cash App. Reportedly, the employee had provided prosecutors with internal Company documents demonstrating that Block had failed to conduct basic due diligence on its customers, that Square had processed thousands of transactions involving countries subject to economic sanctions (including Cuba, Iran, Russia, and Venezuela), and that Block had processed multiple cryptocurrency transactions for terrorist groups.\n\nThese developments have driven the price of Block shares significantly lower.

Then, on Jan. 16, 2025, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) ordered Block to pay $175 million and fix its failures on Cash App user fraud. The CFPB said Cash App attempted to avoid investigative obligations by tricking its users and that Cash App was vulnerable to criminals defrauding users.\n\nFurther related regulatory actions is possible. Block stated in its most recent Form 10-Q quarterly report filed in November, that it “also received inquiries from the SEC and Department of Justice (“DOJ”) shortly after the publication of a short seller report in March 2023. In July 2024, the Company received a follow-on inquiry from the SEC. The Company believes these inquiries primarily relate to the allegations raised in the short seller report, the Company’s compliance and risk practices, and related disclosures. The Company continues to cooperate with both agencies. The Company is unable to predict the likely outcome of these matters and cannot provide any assurance that the SEC or DOJ will not ultimately take legal action against the Company or that the outcome of any such action, if brought, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.”\n\nBlock, Inc.

      "# [Block shares fall on profit, revenue miss by MacKenzie Sigalos, www.facebook.com on 2025-02-20](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/20/block-xyz-earnings-q4-2024.html)\nBlock reported fourth-quarter results on Thursday that fell short of Wall Street expectations. The stock dropped more than 6% in extended trading.\n\nHere is how the company did, compared to analysts' consensus estimates from LSEG.\n\nEarnings per share: 71 cents adjusted vs. 87 cents expected\n\nRevenue: $6.03 billion vs. $6.29 billion expected\n\nRevenue increased about 4.5% from $5.77 billion a year earlier.\n\nBlock, formerly known as Square, posted $2.31 billion in gross profit, a 14% increase from $2.03 billion a year ago. The company, which was an early leader in providing point-of-sale systems for smaller businesses, faces increased competition from the likes of Toast and Fiserv's Clover unit.\n\nGross payment volume came in at $61.95 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $61.3 billion, according to StreetAccount. Block posted adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of $757 million, topping the $740 million average analyst estimate.\n\nBlock said it expects to deliver gross profit growth this year of 15% to $10.22 billion and adjusted operating income of $2.1 billion for a margin of 21%.\n\nBlock's payments business has expanded beyond traditional point-of-sale transactions to include lending and financial services. In 2021, the company acquired Australian buy now, pay later firm Afterpay for $29 billion, integrating the service into Cash App and Square's ecosystem. This week, Afterpay on the Cash App card begins rolling out.\n\nChief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja told CNBC the product launch aims to provide customers with more credit options and positions Cash App as a banking alternative for some customers.\n\nCEO Jack Dorsey said on the earnings call that combining more services like Cash App and Afterpay creates increased spending and engagement.\n\n\"We have a huge base of Cash Card customers that we can deploy this to,\" he said. \"We can do that extremely quickly. It's easy to roll out for us and alert people proactively of entirely new utility that they can use that day, instantly.\"\n\nAnalysts see lending as a key driver of future monetization, with some pointing to additional revenue opportunities in merchant services and advertising within Cash App. The unit recorded $1.38 billion in gross profit, a 16% year-over-year increase, exceeding the $1.36 billion average analyst estimate, according to StreetAccount.\n\nDorsey also articulated the long-term vision of integrating Cash App and Square into a single financial ecosystem, reducing the need for users to rely on multiple apps.\n\n\"There will be a significant reason to use Cash App and not have to go to the App Store for 10 different apps,\" he said. \"Everything is in one app, and that will be the Cash App.\"\n\nUnder Dorsey's leadership, Block made a big jump into bitcoin, including a years-long effort to design and build mining rigs.\n\nBlock's open bitcoin mining system is called Proto. Ahuja said on the earnings call that the company expects the initiative to start benefitting growth in the second half of 2025.\n\nDorsey has long said Block's goal is to open bitcoin mining up to the masses.\n\n\"We do think the market is large, and we do think we're poised to take a significant percentage of it,\" Dorsey said.\n\nHe added that Block is manufacturing chips that it plans to roll out this year, along with its full mining systems.\n\n\"This year is gonna be one of unexpected upside in this business, and one that we significantly change the market dynamics on because of just how well our system works and how configurable it is,\" he said.\n\n— CNBC's Robert Hum contributed to this report.",

Today's call will be 45 minutes. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Nikhil Dixit, head of investor relations. Please go ahead.\n\nNikhil Dixit -- Head of Investor Relations\n\nHi, everyone. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. We have Jack and Amrita with us today.

An audio replay of this call and the transcript for Jack and Amrita's opening remarks will be available on our website shortly. With that, I would like to turn it over to Jack.\n\nJack Dorsey -- Co-Founder, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks for joining. The letter this quarter walks through the progress we made in 2024. We expanded Square from a payments tool into a full commerce platform, enhanced Cash App's financial services offerings, and restructured our organization to move faster against our road map. Looking ahead, we're focused on connecting local communities, block by block through our neighborhood network strategy, investing in AI automation, open-source innovation, and Bitcoin infrastructure, all with the goal of expanding financial access globally.\n\nIf you haven't yet, please read our letter for more details. And with that, I'll turn it over to Amrita for some highlights from the quarter.\n\nAmrita Ahuja -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Jack. In 2024, we drove gross profit growth at scale while dramatically improving efficiency across our business. We ended 2024 with $8.89 billion in gross profit, representing 18% year-over-year growth with Square up 15% and Cash App up 21%. Similar to prior years, we saw gross profit retention of more than 100% in 2024 for both Square and Cash App as we deepen engagement with our customers.\n\nWe saw an acceleration in two key metrics as we exited the year. Square GPV grew 10% year over year in the fourth quarter with improvements in same-store sales and customer retention as year-over-year growth in the U.S. increased 200 basis points sequentially to 6.9%. For Cash App, paycheck deposit actives reached 2.5 million in December, growing 25% year over year, and we saw an increase in momentum in the second half of the year.\n\nOur focus on disciplined execution led to a significant increase in profitability and operating leverage in 2024. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.03 billion, up 69% year over year, and adjusted operating income was $1.61 billion, a more than 4.5 times increase on a year-over-year basis, delivering 13 points of margin expansion. And for the 12 months ending in December, adjusted free cash flow was $2.07 billion compared to $515 million a year ago. We achieved 36.5% on a Rule of 40 basis in 2024, up seven points from the year prior.\n\nLet's look ahead to our guidance for 2025 and share why we're excited about the trajectory of our business across both growth and profitability. Consistent with what we called out last quarter and assuming a stable macro environment, we expect strong gross profit growth of at least 15% year over year or at least $10.22 billion in gross profit. We're maintaining our gross profit guidance for 2025 despite absorbing an incremental 50 basis points of headwinds from FX rates compared to our preliminary guide in early November. Given the unique growth dynamics during the year, including lapping leap year last February and tougher FX comparisons in the early part of 2025, we expect our first quarter guide to be the low point for both gross profit growth and adjusted operating income throughout the year.\n\nOur full-year guidance implies a meaningful inflection in growth during the year, and we have clear visibility into the key drivers of that acceleration as we scale recent product launches and execute on go-to-market. We expect a more pronounced acceleration in Cash App as we broaden access to Cash App Borrow, launch and scale Afterpay on Cash App Card, and invest in marketing. Cash App has sustained strong gross profit growth for years by driving product velocity and successfully stacking new S curves onto its existing product set to deliver more value to customers. We believe we're at the start of another exciting growth phase as we bank our base and with the ability to stack future building blocks of growth from both Borrow and Afterpay on Cash App Card.\n\nWe ended 2024 with 5 million Cash App Borrow monthly actives. This year, we plan to expand to additional customers and offer higher limits by improving underwriting, refining unit economics, expanding to more states, and integrating Borrow with Direct Deposit. Afterpay on Cash App Card launched this week, and we are rolling it out to new customers now after a year of strong testing. We see this product as another way for customers to manage their money and to drive increased spending through Cash App Card.\n\nBeyond these specific products, we're focused on driving more customers to Cash App Card, a gateway to our broader banking offerings, and further growth in paycheck deposit actives. For Square, we expect both GPV and gross profit to improve throughout the year, driven by a combination of both retention and acquisition. We meaningfully ramped marketing investments in the second half of 2024, and the strong returns we have sustained here give us conviction that these will compound as the year progresses. We also continue to invest behind our partnership and field sales strategies, and we expect growth contributions from these initiatives to increase compared to 2024.\n\nThe platform investments we made last year across onboarding, orders, and single app are still expected -- are all expected to drive strength in Square this year. Many of the launches we highlighted this quarter were enabled by our recent platform enhancements. We have an extensive portfolio of growth initiatives across Square and Cash App, and we're excited for those to help drive accelerating growth in 2025. From a profitability perspective, we expect adjusted operating income of $2.1 billion or approximately 21% margin, expanding 240 basis points year over year, even as we grow acquisition spend by more than 20% year over year across Square and Cash App.\n\nWe remain committed to disciplined growth and driving cost efficiencies. We were below our 12,000-person cap at the end of the year, and we intend to remain below for the foreseeable future. In 2024, we built the foundation for our next era of growth, and we're excited about our momentum heading into 2025. Our goal across both Square and Cash App in the year ahead is to make sure we're balancing continued growth investments on product and go-to-market with increased efficiency across our organization.\n\nWith this, we expect to exit 2025 at a Rule of 40 run rate and remain on track to achieve our targeted Rule of 40 in 2026. As Jack said in his letter, we're excited to host you for an Investor Day in the second half of this year to show you more of our progress in these areas. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator instructions] We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thanks. Thanks a lot here. Jack, it feels like I've been thinking about Block a lot, and it feels like a big execution year for you guys in '25.\n\nYou talked about -- Amrita talked about building a foundation in '24. So, I'm curious from your standpoint, beyond the numbers and the guide and all that good stuff, what proof points are you focused on to gauge progress on execution in '25? And how might this year be different than the last couple of years from an execution standpoint?\n\nJack Dorsey -- Co-Founder, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. So, I mean, we intend to double our growth rate across our business, and a lot of that has to do with how we configure ourselves. So, as you said, we spent the majority of last year not only doing but talking about how we've reconfigured and reorganized the company and to set us up for rapid acceleration this year. And I guess the biggest proof point I would look toward is development velocity, how quickly we can now move and how quickly we can ship things, and how quickly we can see the impact or that they're not having impact, so we can make changes or end those things.\n\nI would point you to one early proof point, which is this project we released called codename goose, which is an AI assistant for engineers to start but it can expand to any discipline. We built this for ourselves internally. This team was less than 10 people. They did it in months and not years and we put it out.\n\nAnd we now have a pretty sizable ecosystem of developers building extensions for it and expanding it that we also get better for and we can use. And it points to a pretty foundational move for us where we are now in the conversation with a lot of these AI companies. And I think there's a few areas within that where we can take a leadership position as well. So, we're excited to take that on.\n\nBut that's all a function of us reorganizing our company. This would not be possible at the beginning of last year, but it is now. So, you should expect us to see those throughout the company and across all of our surface areas. We have much better go-to-market clarity and excellence in Nick and team, especially on Square, but certainly for Cash App as well.\n\nSo, we intend to flex that muscle significantly this year and pair it with our better products. We have reconsidered how we release products at Square. We want to be a lot more open with our road map so that we can give sellers time to decide and more information to decide us versus other competitors. And they can get a lot more predictability around installing us or upgrading certain aspects of our system.\n\nAnd then for the first time as a company, since we founded the company, we have a prioritized road map across our entire company and all of our product services and surface areas. This is stack ranked. We have a directly responsible individual on task for each one. That gives us a lot more accountability.\n\nIt gives us a lot more information around how we're investing internally, gives us a lot more clarity around what we're experimenting with and what we're trying to accelerate, and what we're trying to refine and make better. But most importantly, it also gives us clarity and the org clarity on what we need to stop and redeploy our resources, our people, our finances for things that we need to reconsider. So, I'm just running to the whole company and we're starting to run with it, but that will also help a lot with our execution, which will ultimately result in just much better product development velocity, much better learning so we can quickly adapt to the market and what our customers want and ideally be ahead of them with all these new tools that we're building, such as the AI agent systems we're focused on.\n\nAmrita Ahuja -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd Tien-Tsin, I'd just add a couple of thoughts on KPIs, metrics that we're going to be looking at and do look at on a daily and weekly basis. For our two most established businesses, I think it's very clearly acceleration in Square GPV, and for Cash App, it's the ramp of our paycheck deposit actives and then more broadly, engagement across each of those platforms with a broader set of products. From an investment framework perspective, so when we think about the enterprise across Block, we want to see two things. We're laser-focused on being a Rule of 40 company in 2026 and now believe that we can get to that run rate by the end of this year, and positive customer retention across each of our ecosystems.\n\nThat means our existing customers continue to grow, and we continue to add more and more value to them. And then finally, I'd say I think we want to see some build on the signals for our next big building blocks, the next S curves that we're stacking. And I think what you hear from us today is that there's some near-term S curve opportunities with Cash App Borrow and Afterpay on Cash App Card. And then the links between Square and Cash App, the neighborhood network will be laying important proof points behind in 2025, which should benefit us in the years to come.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thank you both for the thoughts.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Tim Chiodo with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTimothy Chiodo -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thank you. I want to talk about 2025 Square GPV growth. When we think about the major building blocks or components, they are same-store sales growth, churn or retention, the size of the new cohort coming on, and then lastly, the annualization of last year's cohort that was brought on.\n\nSo, you made some comments already around exiting the year with some good signs on improved same-store sales and some of the retention metrics getting a little bit better. And MKE may be a part of that if maybe that's getting better or maybe less bad. And then in terms of the size of the new cohort, clearly, there's the sales and marketing spend, there's the new partnerships, and some of the good signs you're seeing there. Cognizant, though, that that last part on the marketing, there's a little bit of a cumulative effect there, meaning it's a little bit more beneficial as it layers into the second half of the year.\n\nSo, putting that all together, I was hoping you could touch on some of those components and really what it means for the exit rate for GPV within the seller ecosystem as we look into the latter part of 2025.\n\nAmrita Ahuja -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nSure. Thanks for the question, Tim. So, let's start with where we exited the year with Square GPV in the fourth quarter up 10% year over year and U.S. growth of 6.9%, both an improvement from the third quarter sequentially, with U.S.\n\ngrowth up 200 basis points relative to where we were in the third quarter, and international growth up five points to 25% relative to where we were in the third quarter. That acceleration in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by two key metrics, same-store growth across our verticals as well as improved seller retention. The two verticals that I would call out in particular driving the acceleration are the two that we're most focused on, which is food and beverage and retail. When we look to 2025, assuming a stable macro environment, we expect GPV to accelerate from these current levels, driven by the product and go-to-market initiatives that we've been talking about for the past few quarters now.\n\nWe expect to see a meaningful uplift in customer acquisition as we move throughout the year and as these investments compound. Now, when we look at it from Q1 to Q4, there's a bit of noise in Q1. We expect Q1 Square GPV growth, when you isolate for that constant currency and leap year, to be in the high single digits, building to low double digits as we exit the year. As I said, there's some noise with that Q1 comparison because of FX and leap year, but we expect the core underlying growth of Square to be roughly in line with Q4 and to improve from here for the rest of the year on the back of a stable macro environment, driving better same-store growth, slightly better retention and stronger acquisition.\n\nMaybe just to quickly unpack what some of those customer acquisition and retention drivers are to accelerate growth. We've grown marketing spend significantly over the past two quarters with strong early ROIs, and we intend to invest behind that in 2025 as well. We expect continued investment across the combination of sales, marketing, and partnerships to drive new seller acquisition. We're seeing better-coordinated strategy across these three levers than we've seen before.\n\nOur retention is strong today, but we expect account management and investments into our product to increase that further. And then we believe we have the opportunity to gain wallet share and drive same-store growth higher. An example of that being Kiosk, which is a product that we expect to increase wallet share. And we'll have more that we expect to launch throughout 2025 to continue to drive that important retention metric for us.\n\nTimothy Chiodo -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller -- Analyst\n\nHey, guys. Thank you. Maybe I could just jump in quickly on Q4 first, the spread between GPV growth and the gross profit growth narrow. Just if you could help us understand a little bit of the dynamics there.\n\nBut then, more importantly, just the building blocks of the gross profit growth ramp expected through the year. I understand a lot of the initiatives will kick in. But if you're starting off, I think you said 11% for Q1, 15% for the year, maybe just help us a little bit more -- a little more granularity of the building blocks to get from that starting point to the 15% for the full year. Thanks, guys.\n\nAmrita Ahuja -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nSure, Darrin. Maybe just to quickly hit off on the first part of your question for Q4. Keep in mind, when you're thinking about GPV versus gross profit, the banking ecosystem had a tougher compare in the fourth quarter. So, we saw -- right.\n\nSo, we had 12% growth overall from a gross profit perspective in the fourth quarter. From a banking perspective, we had 13% growth in the fourth quarter. And as a reminder, our banking products grew by 28% in the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by some elevated loan volume growth. So, it's a tougher compare from a banking perspective.\n\nAs we look to this year, 2025, let me start with sort of the dynamics that we see in the first quarter. And then the line of sight, the clear visibility that we have to the drivers of gross profit accelerating throughout the year. So, first, we recognize the growth rate dynamics as we start the year unique for a couple of different reasons, some idiosyncratic headwinds like FX and leap year and then some tougher compares like the banking one I mentioned. So, in the first quarter, leap year is expected to create a roughly one-point headwind to gross profit growth for both Square and Cash App with an additional approximate one-point headwind to Square's gross profit growth from FX.\n\nAnd then in addition to that, we have Square Banking with an incredibly strong Q1 in '24, where it grew by 36% as we grew originations at an accelerated rate as a tougher comp for us this Q1. And then from a Cash App perspective, again, a tougher compare related to some pricing changes for Bitcoin, where we had the full quarter benefit of that last Q1 as well as some benefits from the price appreciation of Bitcoin. Now, with those Q1 dynamics in mind, let's turn to where we have confidence that we can build upon these compounding benefits that we see of our product and go-to-market initiatives into the remainder of the year. So, for Square, we expect gross profit growth trends to align closely with GPV trends in 2025.\n\nWe'd see GPV growth acceleration drivers that we've talked about, go-to-market investments, new products to gain traction and compound during the year and, as a result, expect to see gross profit accelerating off the Q1 levels. We're also growing our marketing spend here, again, behind strong ROIs and are continuing to add sales and partnership resources, all of which we expect to result in accelerating new customer acquisition. We have much higher expectations for our sales and partnership investments this year than we did last year. And we met and exceeded our targets last year, and we intend to do the same this year.\n\nFrom a Cash App perspective, we expect the acceleration throughout the year to be more pronounced, exiting 2025 well above the Q1 gross profit growth rate. We think we have a unique opportunity here on this next phase of growth for Cash App between Borrow and Afterpay on Cash App Card. Afterpay on Cash App Card, we are, after a year of sort of methodically testing this, now launching this week, allowing customers more ways to manage their money and giving them more optionality at checkout. Cash App Card at 25 million monthly actives in December is an amazing distribution surface for us to launch these sorts of product features into.\n\nAnd it's one that we saw really resonate with customers as we were in testing over this past year with nearly $150 million in originations just in the beta alone. And then for Borrow, this product that has scaled meaningfully in 2024, we believe that there is a tremendous amount of opportunity left for growth in a variety of different areas. This year, as I mentioned earlier, making Borrow available to more customers with higher limits by improved underwriting, better unit economics, and expanding into additional states. Also enabling Borrow to be a driver for paycheck deposits by creating greater integrations there.\n\nAnd then finally, I'd say, as I point to looking at our exit out of 2025 is that we'd expect to see Proto, our Bitcoin mining initiative, to start benefiting growth in the second half of the year as well.\n\nDarrin Peller -- Analyst\n\nThanks, Amrita.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Dolev -- Analyst\n\nHey, guys, great quarter. Thanks for taking my question. I have a long-term strategic question maybe for Jack on your -- on Proto, the open Bitcoin mining system, it looks really interesting. Could it -- maybe could it be the next Cash App? Like how big is the upside from that and what's the long-term vision and strategy for that product? Appreciate it.\n\nJack Dorsey -- Co-Founder, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. This is one we're really excited about. We do think the market is large, and we do think we're poised to take a significant percentage of it because there is one player really in this space, and customers want other options. We did a bunch of research.\n\nWe talked with a bunch of these mining customers, and we found that they didn't have the reliability they needed. They didn't have the customization they needed. They didn't have the ability to upgrade and build their own custom systems around their rigs. And some of them wanted just like a full system that just worked off the shelf, that was built in the U.S.\n\nAnd the fact that it's open source and were on a three-nanometer process allows us to have much better performance and a much stronger road map looking forward. So, we do think we're poised well. We're manufacturing our chips now. They're going to be rolling out this year along with our full systems.\n\nAnd this year is going to be one of, I think, like unexpected upside in this business and one that we significantly changed the market dynamics because of just how well our system works and how configurable it is. So, within this space, yes, I do think it's a massive opportunity and one that's well, well, well overdue.\n\nDan Dolev -- Analyst\n\nIt definitely seems like that. Thanks again, Jack.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Robby Bamberger with Baird.\n\nRobert Bamberger -- Baird -- Analyst\n\nYeah, thanks for taking my question. Cash App MAUs have been flattish at around 57 million the last several quarters. I guess what would it take for these to start growing again? Is it incremental marketing spend, new products, or something else?\n\nAmrita Ahuja -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nHey, I'm happy to start us off here. Thanks for the question, Robby. So, let's start -- I think the short answer is we think that there is significant opportunity for growth longer term. But there's some deliberate decisions that we've made as part of our banker-based strategy in the near term that have resulted in a consistent sort of 57 million monthly actives, which grew 2% year over year in December.\n\nThis is a part of our continuous enhancements to drive healthy customer engagement as we bank our base. We've made investments in critical areas like compliance support and risk. And as we've done that, we've progressed more of our actives through our identity verification process, which, in turn, unlocks greater access to those actives to our full suite of financial tools. So, as we've made those investments, we have seen benefits come through in a couple of different places.\n\nFirst, from a product growth perspective, we've seen that accrete to engagement and attach on products like Cash App Card, Direct Deposit, and Borrow, all of which you heard about today, obviously, but also accrete to benefits to our unit economics. Risk loss for us has been an area of operating expense leverage on both peer-to-peer and Cash App Card risk loss over the past year. And I think that's critically tied to the enhancements we've made to the platform here. In the near term, this year, we expect the biggest drivers of Cash App gross profit growth should be metrics like inflows per active and monetization rate or ARPU, whereas we'd expect actives growth to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis this year.\n\nNow, longer term, to your question, we see a significant opportunity to grow actives, particularly among that digital native audience like Millennial and Gen Zs. We also see powerful network effect connections across our audiences, among teams and families, and across our other brands. Afterpay customers, many of whom will be introduced to Cash App through the integrations like the one that we're launching this week with bringing Afterpay functionality into Cash App Card as well as Square buyers. The more we can execute on our neighborhood network strategy to connect these two ecosystems.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Bauch with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Bauch -- Analyst\n\nHey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to hit on the Cash App flywheel and how you've called out the rolling monetization opportunities by stacking these multiple S curves. And now that we have Afterpay functionality live in the Cash Card, I guess how would you characterize the potential of this S curve compared to innovation and products you've introduced in the past? And then if there are any high-level thoughts you could provide around goals for attach, monetization contributions, all would be super helpful. Thank you.\n\nJack Dorsey -- Co-Founder, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah, I can start this. I mean, I think it's a huge S curve because the entire company is focused on just this one thing. And what matters most for Cash App and the Cash App Card is that these all stack together, but they actually positively reinforce one another as well. So, we have, as Amrita said earlier, we have a huge base of Cash Card customers that we can deploy this to.\n\nWe can do that extremely quickly. It's easy to roll out for us and other people proactively of an entirely new utility that they can use that day in selling. And ultimately, that provides us flywheel into more spend and more usage of other adjacent aspects of Cash App, which we continue to look to deepen and broaden that ecosystem and ultimately connect it with the Square ecosystem, which speaks to what I believe is our two superpowers that we have both these ecosystems at scale with both sides of the counter. And now we can bring more financial tools and more financial utility that people can't find elsewhere as connected to every single person that's already using Cash App and the Cash App Card, but also there will be a significant reason to use Cash App and not have to go to the App Store for 10 different apps.\n\nEverything is in one app, and it will be the Cash App.\n\nAmrita Ahuja -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd I'll just add a couple of points to help contextualize as well, Andrew, both on Afterpay and Cash App Card, and then I want to speak a bit to Borrow. But similar to how we've ramped Cash App Borrow, with Afterpay and Cash App Card, as Jack said, we see a tremendous opportunity. As we always do, we'll start small, expecting millions of monthly actives to be eligible this year, and then ramp those offerings where we determine eligibility, obviously, based on adoption and improvements to our underwriting models as we gather more data. So, we'd expect Afterpay and Cash App Card to benefit gross profit and compound in that benefit throughout the year, benefiting our growth more in the second half of the year as we've called out related to the acceleration in Cash App gross profit throughout the year.\n\nI think it's also, if we're speaking about S curves for Cash App, important for us to talk about Cash App Borrow as well. And when you look at the growth and attraction that this product has achieved, what we're seeing is that our customers really value the optionality to manage their cash flows that Cash App Borrow provides. And I think that's similar to what Afterpay will provide as well in Cash App Card. But we shared last quarter in a recent survey, 43% of our Borrow actives, which we now ended the year with 5 million Cash App Borrow monthly actives, 43% reported that the loans helped them pay their bills, 38% said that these loans helped them smooth cash flows between paychecks.\n\nIt's a part of how they're managing their money. And products like Borrow help deepen that customer relationship. We've seen Borrow actives bring in 13% more inflows and conduct 6% more transactions than non-Borrow actives and drive 10% higher variable profit to us on a proactive basis, even excluding the profit generated from Borrow. So, we saw strong growth in Borrow this past year, but we think we have an opportunity to expand it further, as I've mentioned already, into 2025 and continue to compound the benefits beyond the 5 million Borrow monthly actives that we had at the end of the year.\n\nMaybe the final point I'll make here is in 2024, about 25% of actives chose to take out a Borrow loan after getting an offer. And that number is significantly higher for paycheck deposit actives, which gives us confidence that access to credit ultimately is an important part of our much broader banker-based strategy going forward.\n\nAndrew Bauch -- Analyst\n\nReally interesting. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Kupferberg -- Analyst\n\nYeah, hi, guys. I was hoping you could just put a finer point on the gross profit guide by segment for Q1 and for the full year. And then if you can just talk about maybe the top two or three Square initiatives that you really think will move the needle on GPV in 2025. Thank you.\n\nAmrita Ahuja -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nSure. Happy to start off on the gross profit question. As we said, we expect to see ramping gross profit growth through the year, with Cash App's acceleration throughout the year being more pronounced relative to Square's, albeit we expect to see growth trends improve throughout the year. And we expect Q1 to be the lower point throughout the year in terms of gross profit growth and profitability.\n\nAgain, some of the key initiatives that we've talked about in terms of sales and marketing, product launches, and the ramp of products like Borrow or Afterpay on Cash App Card are the key elements that compound that drive the more meaningful growth rate as we exit the year relative to where we start in Q1. On the second part, go for it, Jack.\n\nJack Dorsey -- Co-Founder, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nI'll take it. On the Square side in terms of drivers, as we talked about for quite some time, we want to really simplify our go-to-market and also add a lot of strength there. We've got a lot of strength by changing the team, making a lot more efficient, being more open to partnerships and new ways to market. And then we have a bunch of products in that initiatives that we think will help us clarify that message, including bringing the Square app into -- the five Square apps into one Square app so it's just much easier to onboard people and that it is customizable as you tell us more information, as you use it more, it flexes to your needs.\n\nSecond, like we are -- we've completed our transition from a technology sector perspective. That means far greater reliability. That means far greater development velocity. That means we're not just a payments platform, we're actually an orders and commerce platform, which gives us more flexibility in terms of what we can build.\n\nAnd just some examples of this, we have Bar Tabs, which we don't have forever. It went to GA. We rolled out Scan The Pay functionality, introduced house accounts, launched other features to bolster our food and beverage offerings, which is a big focus for us. And we rolled out Instant Payouts for marketplace delivery orders, which is helping customers with the task of managing their cash flow.\n\nBut the net of it is we have a much stronger go-to-market. We have a lot more focus and simpler call to action on that. We've completely changed our platform to allow us a lot more flexibility to build the features that we -- that have been gaps. And it will also allow us to create entirely new features that we're super excited about.\n\nAnother big driver that we talk a little bit about in the letter is going to be the neighborhood network. This is utilizing Cash App to drive more people than Cash App customers, in particular, to Square merchants, give them new tools to offer cash back instantly to their customers, build loyalty to do remote ordering, and that continues to be in beta and we will continue to expand it this year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nRamsey El-Assal -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\nHi, Jack and Amrita. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to actually follow up, Jack, on the last thing that you mentioned, which is the neighborhood network strategy. I'm trying to think through, maybe you could help us think through sizing the opportunity, how much investment or build is required here? And also, any thoughts on timing? So size, investment, and timing of the neighborhood network.\n\nThanks.\n\nJack Dorsey -- Co-Founder, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. Well, first and foremost, we're the only company at scale that have both sides of the counter like this, so we have the seller side and we have the individual side. And we've tried to do this in the past and really capitalize on the opportunity, but we just didn't have the scale on the consumer side to the degree that we needed. A lot of you who have been following us for quite some time might remember Square Wallet or what we called Card Case way back in the day.\n\nNow, we do have the scale on Cash App and now we can actually act on it. And we see a number of problems that sellers are facing with the current offerings for pickup, for reservations, for remote ordering that we can help with. We can also give them entirely new tools to give things like boosts or instant cashbacks immediately to their customers, which builds loyalty and to give them more discovery through the lens of the Cash App itself. This represents a very easy selling point for our sales team because it means that we're turning on this massive faucet of Cash App customers to potentially discover the business but also give them these great tools to retain their customers.\n\nAnd to your question of in terms of building entirely new things, most of this is more of a connection and just prioritizing the right connections to get the experience correct. A lot of the work is going to be more around converting our existing Square customers to online entities and that benefits us, and it benefits them and benefits their customers, and it certainly makes this neighborhood network a lot more possible. So, we're going to be thinking deeply about how to migrate folks easily and allow them to have a storefront that they're proud of, that can work with the system, and which allows more commerce and more sales on their side. In terms of timeline, we are in beta right now in a few cities.\n\nWe're making sure that we get the experience right before expanding it. And of course, we want it to be a lot more self-serve so that goes to that migration point that I was talking about. And ideally, one-button push so that sellers can just turn this on, and they're in business and they get new traffic. That's the goal.\n\nSo, look for more of these proof points early this year and all the way to the end of the year.\n\nAmrita Ahuja -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd Ramsey, I would just add on your question about investment, we've already got significant investment deployed across each of these ecosystems. It's really about bringing the strategy together in support of the two ecosystems working together. So, an example of that is in Square, we're already building a field sales team. We're hiring that out.\n\nWe've seeded our first territories. We're doing that in areas where we have strong partnership strategy, but we're also prioritizing cities with high Cash App density to drive the ecosystem connections. An example city would be Atlanta, where we see strong Square seller presence as well as Cash App presence. And the two can feed off of each other.\n\nSo, it's not even necessarily about incremental investments. It's about a coordinated approach and strategy as we deploy those investments.\n\nRamsey El-Assal -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\nGot it. Thank you. That's perfect.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Rayna Kumar with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nRayna Kumar -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\n\nHi, Jack and Amrita. Thanks for taking my question. Could you elaborate on any feedback that you're getting from vendors on your initial testing on your enhanced Square for Restaurants point-of-sale experience? Thank you.\n\nJack Dorsey -- Co-Founder, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. I mean, we're getting pretty good feedback from the focus. I mean, things like the Bar Tabs and everything that we've built to ship from just being a payments platform to a commerce platform are working because we're building the features that sellers before, especially food and beverage sellers could only find in our competitors. And the most important part of us being able to close those gaps is that we can introduce people to the broader Square ecosystem, including all of our banking.\n\nSquare, I think, continues to excel in our product offering because of our quality, because it is more self-serve and owners of these businesses, and their employees can do more of the things that they need to do without having to reach out to support or having a sales or executive account agent who's handholding them along the way. And that's where our technology-led approach leads and really matters. And we're going to continue to push that and give people better and better tools to help automate some of the more mechanical aspects of the business so they can really focus on their customers and building their business. But thus far, it's been good.\n\nWe have much stronger feedback loops now that we've functionalized the company between customer support and sales and our product teams and our development teams so that we can act on feedback much faster. And as I talked about in the first part of the call, what matters to us most is development velocity so that we can quickly make changes, we can learn from experiments much faster, and we can deploy technology in a way that addresses customer needs and hopefully predicts them ahead of their ask and also ahead of our competitors, which we intend to do.\n\nAmrita Ahuja -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, Rayna, I'll just add that I think what you see from us is a greater rate of product velocity as we shifted from a payments platform to an orders platform. And you see that firsthand in the restaurant point-of-sale enhancements that we've rolled out and are continuing to roll out to all of our sellers this year. Between Kiosks, Bar Tabs, Scan to Pay, House Accounts, item splitting, Instant Payouts, these are all launches over the past six months. And we've got more to come for this really critical vertical.\n\nAnd I think what you see is that when we're able to get that into people's hands and demonstrate, as we are with our field sales efforts, what a larger seller and in the food and beverage space can do. And even a QSR like Bluestone Lane that we mentioned in our letter, it's a pretty powerful demonstration and one that, frankly, flies in the face of the perception of Square being the little reader company. And so that's what we're doing with investing into our partnerships, field sales, and marketing approach to be able to expand and bring awareness to the much more expansive set of offerings that we have for QSR and FSR. And I think that's starting to bear fruit now with some of these larger seller wins, but there's a lot more for us to do behind that.\n\nAnd I expect you'll also see greater product velocity, again, behind that platform shift that we completed last year.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now take our last question from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Keane -- Analyst\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the strength in Afterpay in the quarter what you saw there. And as we think about the rollout of Afterpay on the Cash Card, I guess it's almost in lieu of a credit card.\n\nThe growth there can be pretty material, I assume, going forward. How do we think about the profitability of that card as we seriously ramp it this year and into next? Thanks.\n\nAmrita Ahuja -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nSure. Maybe I'll start on the last part of your question first, which is, first of all, we get to determine eligibility for Afterpay on the Cash App Card. So, we get to put -- create as an input based on what we see from risk loss rates, adoption rates, etc., how to pace the growth of Afterpay on Cash App Card. Based on what we saw during the beta with the strong attach rates and risk loss rates, we're excited for what we could be compounding here throughout the year.\n\nBut again, that's one that we can read the metrics on a daily basis and sort of tune the knobs based on the performance. And it is -- risk loss is an important investment area for us in some of these ramping lending products, be it Afterpay, Afterpay on Cash App Card or Cash App in the quarter, in the Q4 quarter, which obviously is a seasonally important quarter for us, GMV was up 19% year over year. Gross profit was up 23% year over year. Growth was primarily driven by our core pay in four offerings, which grew similarly to the prior quarters.\n\nGift cards growth accelerated in the second half and, in particular, in Q4 as we expanded eligibility for gift cards globally to the U.K. And as you noted, we've got a lot of opportunity ahead of us as we think about Buy Now, Pay Later. Afterpay to Cash App Card, obviously, which we're launching this week. Core Buy Now, Pay Later, we saw global revenue retention improve year over year with strong trends, especially in our enterprise segment.\n\nAnd in 2025, we have a number of enterprise merchants in our deal pipeline that we're continuing to sign as we go to expand the value proposition. And then gift cards, we've been expanding eligibility to more merchants in the U.K. late last year and in the U.S. in early 2025, all of this while we're maintaining strong loss rates in line with historical ranges for these products.\n\nLosses on consumer receivables were 0.97% of GMV in the fourth quarter, below our 1% target. So, continuing to ramp but do that responsibly.\n\nBryan Keane -- Analyst\n\nOK. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's program.

      "# [XYZ Stock At $70: Time To Worry Or Opportunity To Pounce? by Trefis Team on 2025-02-24](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/02/24/xyz-stock-at-70-time-to-worry-or-opportunity-to-pounce/)\nBlock Inc. (NYSE: XYZ) recently released its Q4 results, reporting earnings of $0.71 per share on sales of $6.03 billion, compared to consensus estimates of $0.87 per share and $6.29 billion in sales.\n\nBlock, formerly known as Square, is a fintech company that provides digital payments, point-of-sale hardware and software, along with other technology-driven financial services. From payment processing to loans and banking, Block now offers an expanded range of financial products. Furthermore, Block facilitates bitcoin trading by purchasing the cryptocurrency from private dealers and selling it to users at a modest markup.\n\nBlock stock, which has returned -12% since the beginning of 2024, has underperformed the S&P 500 index, which is up 28%. A tepid growth in gross payment volume and monthly active users did not satisfy investors and adversely affected its stock performance over the past year. If you are seeking an upside with a steadier ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved returns of over 91% since its inception.\n\nHow Did Block Perform in Q4?\n\nBlock’s revenue of $6.03 billion in Q4 demonstrated a 4.5% year-over-year increase. In terms of revenue segments, transaction revenue increased 5.1% to $1.7 billion, while subscription and services revenue experienced the strongest gains, rising 16.8% to $1.9 billion. Hardware revenue declined 4.3% to $31 million, and Bitcoin-related revenue decreased 3.7% to $2.4 billion. Key performance indicators for Block showed strong results, with gross payment volume reaching $61.95 billion—a 7.8% increase year-over-year. EBITDA also exceeded expectations, coming in at $757 million, up 34.7% from the previous year. Both GPV and EBITDA figures surpassed street estimates of $61.3 billion and $740 million, respectively.\n\nIn Q4, Block’s profitability surged, as adjusted operating margins climbed to 17%, marking an 800 basis point improvement over the prior year. Earnings per share increased by 51% to $0.71. The company’s guidance suggests continued growth, with Q1 gross profit anticipated to rise by 11% to $2.32 billion at a 19% operating margin, and 2025 forecasts projecting $10.22 billion in gross profit with 21% operating margins.\n\nWhat Does It Mean for Block Stock?\n\nBlock’s shares dropped 18% following the release of its Q4 results. However, such volatility is not unusual for Block stock. Over a slightly longer timeframe, XYZ stock has consistently underperformed the broader market, with returns of -26% in 2021, -61% in 2022, 23% in 2023, and 10% in 2024.\n\nPreserve & Grow Wealth with Risk-Focused Quality Portfolios\n\nIn contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, is notably less volatile. It has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, offering a less turbulent ride, as evidenced by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\n\nGiven the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, characterized by rate cuts and multiple conflicts, could XYZ face a similar scenario as in the past four years and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months—or will it experience a recovery?\n\nAt its current level of around $70, Block stock carries a price-to-sales ratio of 1.8x, which is below its four-year average of 2.8x. Although the recent results were disappointing, we believe that Block stock’s current valuation adequately reflects the challenges posed by increased competition and the company’s recent performance. We think that the current valuation provides an attractive entry point for robust long-term gains.\n\nWhile Block stock appears to have growth potential, it is useful to compare its performance with that of its peers on key metrics.
