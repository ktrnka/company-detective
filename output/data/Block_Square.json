      "# Post ID 1i3r3v5: Betting $1M on BLOCK ($SQ) as a bitcoin mining play  with +639 score by [(convexdominance6, Reddit, 2025-01-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i3r3v5/betting_1m_on_block_sq_as_a_bitcoin_mining_play/)\nJack Dorsey (dad) is the second biggest bitcoin dick rider after Saylor. The problem with Jack is that he's a low key CEO that doesn't like to be in the public eye and therefore sucks at pumping his own stock. This is where we come in. Time to shed some light on how undervalued BLOCK is. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0jey95tnemde1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fade12885ceee25efd9999c9b81868c4b9fb794\n\nFirst, Block is becoming a player in the bitcoin mining space. They are developing their own chip/rig with Proto. Proto is a suite of bitcoin mining products and services designed to help decentralize the global supply of mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate. Proto works to increase builder access to bitcoin mining chips and rigs while increasing network resiliency and making everyday use of bitcoin secure and simple.\n\nBlock also has \\~8,211 BTC valued at \\~$862M.\n\nTRUMP loves crypto and has recently stated he plans to designate Cryptocurrency as a National Priority. He will enact pro-crypto executive orders on day 1 (that's why BTC is mooning right now). He also stated he wants all bitcoin mining to be done in America.\n\nSecond, here is a graph of BLOCK's revenue growth vs share price (self-explanatory).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l3t5nfgyemde1.jpg?width=1127&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41dc53398278e88c4ba14ca451753559948a032a\n\nThird, from a TA perspective, the recent price action has been constructive (below) and the breakout from the 2 year base should be explosive. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bxiefs50fmde1.jpg?width=861&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0113aa101c8263f846ff3951afdba217c99e0d6d\n\n  \nNot sure how this hasn't caught on as a bitcoin play when all these other shitco's that do bitcoin mining or just have BTC on their balance sheet have absolutely rocketed in the past 4 months. When the hype catches up, we should see some explosive moves up to $100+.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l2ihr849fmde1.jpg?width=1206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9839f9029595f7084eff9a2943f65a2b7ba1421\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID m7pc62y with +363 score by [(ClandestineGK, Reddit, 2025-01-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i3r3v5/betting_1m_on_block_sq_as_a_bitcoin_mining_play/m7pc62y/) (in reply to ID 1i3r3v5):\nNice, I have the same expiry but 4,999 less contracts.\n\n### Comment ID m7pf08g with +98 score by [(DisgruntledTexan, Reddit, 2025-01-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i3r3v5/betting_1m_on_block_sq_as_a_bitcoin_mining_play/m7pf08g/) (in reply to ID m7pc62y):\nThat’s what margin is for\n\n#### Comment ID m7pgdbb with +21 score by [(Regular-Fish-8898, Reddit, 2025-01-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i3r3v5/betting_1m_on_block_sq_as_a_bitcoin_mining_play/m7pgdbb/) (in reply to ID m7pf08g):\nBanger\n\n### Comment ID m7ud15o with +6 score by [(DeepMeat9053, Reddit, 2025-01-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i3r3v5/betting_1m_on_block_sq_as_a_bitcoin_mining_play/m7ud15o/) (in reply to ID m7pc62y):\nCalling someone “dad” who lost 70% of the company’s value is crazy\n\n### Comment ID m7ylph3 with +1 score by [(LoudAndCuddly, Reddit, 2025-01-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i3r3v5/betting_1m_on_block_sq_as_a_bitcoin_mining_play/m7ylph3/) (in reply to ID m7pc62y):\nHahaha fkn <whip meme>\n\n## Comment ID m7p4y2w with +594 score by [(Qzy, Reddit, 2025-01-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i3r3v5/betting_1m_on_block_sq_as_a_bitcoin_mining_play/m7p4y2w/) (in reply to ID 1i3r3v5):\nOP stop taking pictures of homeless people.\n\n### Comment ID m7p6zib with +197 score by [(Jdmfookboi32, Reddit, 2025-01-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i3r3v5/betting_1m_on_block_sq_as_a_bitcoin_mining_play/m7p6zib/) (in reply to ID m7p4y2w):\nJack Dorsey looks like the CEO of Skid Row\n\n#### Comment ID m7qle8s with +51 score by [(KefirFan, Reddit, 2025-01-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i3r3v5/betting_1m_on_block_sq_as_a_bitcoin_mining_play/m7qle8s/) (in reply to ID m7p6zib):\nI've been offered meth by people dumpster diving that look more professional than Jack.\n\n#### Comment ID m7pa04o with +23 score by [(StrongDoor9459, Reddit, 2025-01-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i3r3v5/betting_1m_on_block_sq_as_a_bitcoin_mining_play/m7pa04o/) (in reply to ID m7p6zib):\nMore like skid mark amiright ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)\n\n#### Comment ID m7u71wg with +4 score by [(FederalExpressMan, Reddit, 2025-01-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i3r3v5/betting_1m_on_block_sq_as_a_bitcoin_mining_play/m7u71wg/) (in reply to ID m7p6zib):\nI mean SQ does own Cashapp\n\n### Comment ID m7q246v with +27 score by [(bmeisler, Reddit, 2025-01-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i3r3v5/betting_1m_on_block_sq_as_a_bitcoin_mining_play/m7q246v/) (in reply to ID m7p4y2w):\nIt’s been a weird SV flex for decades - dress like a bum, er, excuse me, unhoused person - while sporting a $100k watch.

Holding on to losers looking for them to rebound is almost always a bad strategy. Actually, come to think of it that applies to life in general not just stocks :)\n\nAnd remember, if you buy a stock at $100 and it drops to $50 that is a 50% loss.

In contrast, if you bought some shares of another company for $40 and they later went up to $90, then they're probably worth about $90.\n\nThere is no way to look at the prior history of a stock and use that information to predict its future movements. To the extent that such analysis is possible, smarter and richer people with more information and more supercomputers than you have already done it and captured all of the benefit that can be had from that analysis. All you can do is take the current market price of a stock as its most likely long-term value.\n\nTherefore, if capital gains taxes aren't a concern, there's no reason to sell one stock over another.

There's nothing wrong with receiving UI benefits in cash app, they just want to make sure someone didn't file on your behalf and you actually were eligible for the benefits.

It looks legit (or a highly advanced scam - which, I doubt) but it's not a subpoena to YOU. It is an information subpoena to Block/ Square. They are simply sending you a copy so that you are aware since your account might be included in the information request. \n\nIt appears to be an income investigation, perhaps on someone who has collected unemployment benefits. Let's say your brother was collecting unemployment checks and you sent him $100 for football tickets, to split a restaurant bill, or simply to help him out, you're both going to be fine. They are most likely looking for multiple large transaywhihc would be an indication that he's got a gig on the side which he didn't report as he is required to do.\n\nIf you did nothing wrong, you're not in any trouble so take that off your mind.

It can't be addressed to \"Dear Sir or Madam.\" It would need to have your actual name on it. And if your name is on the subpoena, then one would think that it would be on the letter.

When companies potentially run afoul of the law and are subject to discovery, they are required to notify their customers who may have their information provided as part of this process.  This letter is simply fulfilling the Block/Sqaure legal notification requirement.  There’s nothing for the OP to do unless they want to take legal action against Block/Square to prevent the release of this information.  I’d ignore the letter.

Some government agencies have subpoena power, in addition to courts and lawyers engaged in litigation.  This one appears to originate from an Indiana state agency.  \n2.  The OP hasn't shown the actual subpoena, only a cover letter explaining that a subpoena was enclosed, and the attachment specifying documents.  \n3.  The subpoena wasn't to the OP, but to some cash app that the OP uses.  There's no reason why the OP would be named in the subpoena.  As was fairly clear from the documents demanded in Attachment A, the demand to the cash app was related to all accounts.  \n4.  The parts of the correspondence shown by the OP are absolutely consistent with standard *subpoena duces tecum* language (a *subpoena duces tecum* is a subpoena for documents, rather than for a personal appearance).  It is completely consistent with such subpoenas from government agencies that my clients have been served with.  \n4.

If you think the company is thriving the stock price will eventually go up if that's true. May take many years. \n\nIt's also a good idea to make sure you're not overweight in that stock because you do work there.\n\n## Comment ID jom2av5 with +14 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14cmjxs/block_sq_positions_hold_or_sell/jom2av5/) (in reply to ID 14cmjxs):\nReddit sentiment is basically the trend of a stock. \n\nGoogle goes down? Chatgpt is taking shares. Sundar is a bad lead, it’s end of world for google \n\nFb? Same story\n\nGoogle goes back up? Best company in the world! Buy! \n\nIMO, block is way too oversold.

If you think Block is the best way to allocate your money then hold, if you have other positions you would like to enter then go for those. \n\nRather than thinking about the past think about where to best allocate for the future and rebalance accordingly. IMO do not make short term positions, buy and hold high conviction companies for min 2+ years.\n\nAdditionally are you trading or investing? If you invest into a company, typically it will take years for the team to execute their vision and business plan. Buying and selling short term is called trading.\n\nRemember there is Block share holders who have been in the company for many years and will likely continue to be in for the next many years.\n\n## Comment ID jolic1g with +11 score by [(cosmic_backlash, Reddit, 2023-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14cmjxs/block_sq_positions_hold_or_sell/jolic1g/) (in reply to ID 14cmjxs):\nI think Block has a great future. I generally think Dorsey has good visions, but I do not think he is a good CEO.

The big banks followed suit with their investments in Fintech services  to catch up and now every major big bank has a lot of Fintech saturated. The Fintech hype train has reached its eventual destination with valuations crashing down to earth and letting the normal course of business continue. Everyone with an idea got into it thinking they could replace visa and MasterCard getting those large margins forgetting that these duopolies have economies of scale and so much infrastructural scale. Square realized this eventually and renamed itself to get into the next big thing: Block. \n\nAnd now the crypto hype train has crashed too.\n\nThe hype is dead now. Valuations have fallen back to earth. The peak was when they bought tidal and got into buy now lose later. Same with Paypal...the peak was when their Fintech business got saturated and hyped up so much with a huge valuation that they even considered buying a totally unrelated business in Pinterest. \n\nNow that crypto is dead with no real world use case other than speculation and money laundering,  they should pivot to the next big thing which is AI:  BICS: Block Intelligent Cash Square.\n\n## Comment ID jolby9r with +2 score by [(MedPhys90, Reddit, 2023-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14cmjxs/block_sq_positions_hold_or_sell/jolby9r/) (in reply to ID 14cmjxs):\nIf you have > 100, why not sell calls each week?\n\n### Comment ID joltnkl with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14cmjxs/block_sq_positions_hold_or_sell/joltnkl/) (in reply to ID jolby9r):\nIf the OP is still employed there, they can't trade derivatives on SQ\n\n### Comment ID jolf21i with +3 score by [(Delicious-Bathroom17, Reddit, 2023-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14cmjxs/block_sq_positions_hold_or_sell/jolf21i/) (in reply to ID jolby9r):\nI’m not as familiar with calls as I should be.

The higher the strike, the less the call and the less you will make. However, the chances of ending in the money is less as well. So it depends on whether you want yo keep the stock or not. If the stock is something you want yo keep around, set your strike several strikes out of the money. Your weekly return will be less but you’ll keep the stock and can turn around and sell another covered call the next week. You’ll earn anywhere from $130 to as little as $20 each week per 100 shares. May not sound like a lot but do that week after week and it adds up.\n\n## Comment ID jolws73 with +2 score by [(ProfessionalDark3309, Reddit, 2023-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14cmjxs/block_sq_positions_hold_or_sell/jolws73/) (in reply to ID 14cmjxs):\nBetter opportunity cost elsewhere if you sell at a loss right now.\n\n## Comment ID joli5ym with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14cmjxs/block_sq_positions_hold_or_sell/joli5ym/) (in reply to ID 14cmjxs):\nHold - Blockchain is expected to grow at a CAGR of around ~60% per year until 2030.

Leadership at all levels should embody the qualities that attract and retain top talent.\n\t•\tEnsure that hiring managers are well-versed in company culture and values. Leaders need to not only understand these principles but also actively model and communicate them.\n\t•\tFoster a culture where employees and candidates feel heard, respected, and valued—this starts with clear communication, mutual respect, and accountability.\n\t•\tCreate structures to encourage and embrace innovation, ensuring employees feel comfortable sharing new ideas without fear of them being dismissed.\n\nFinal Thought:\nSquare and Block have immense potential to lead by example in the fintech industry, and their mission is worth believing in. With its strong foundation, Square has the opportunity to not only excel in financial technology but also set the standard for inclusive, value-driven workplaces. With stronger alignment in leadership, a renewed focus on respect and innovation, and hiring managers who embody these principles, the company could create an even more impactful and inspiring environment for its teams and candidates.",

For example:\n\t•\tEmpathy: Some interactions during the interview process lacked basic engagement and respect, which felt at odds with the company’s commitment to this value.\n\t•\tTransparency: It was evident the position had already been filled before my interview, but this was not communicated. This lack of openness diminished trust in the process.\n\t•\tInnovation: Suggestions for thinking outside the box during a role-play exercise were dismissed outright, which seemed contradictory to Block’s emphasis on creativity.\n\t•\tKnowledge Gaps: One of the interviewers did not know how to answer when asked how they foster a positive company culture. This is a red flag, as fostering culture is fundamental to a company’s leadership and values.",

After the team favorites were promoted the promo rules magically changed. Now you need a \"business need\" for your promotion so you're essentially stuck in your level unless you switch roles or your exec is promoted; I supported some of the worst execs in my EA career at Block, Inc. which is crazy because Block has great people but some of the senior leaders (across the company) aren't so great and are instead super problematic with poor internal reputations. Before the layoffs, politics in the EO department was insane. Some leads give a lot of lip service and will act like they support you and are \"there\" for you but actually aren't. Some leads literally don't respect confidentiality and run their mouths like teenagers in high school.",

After the team favorites were promoted the promo rules magically changed. Now you need a \"business need\" for your promotion so you're essentially stuck in your level unless you switch roles or your exec is promoted; I supported some of the worst execs in my EA career at Block, Inc. which is crazy because Block has great people but some of the senior leaders (across the company) aren't so great and are instead super problematic with poor internal reputations. Before the layoffs, politics in the EO department was insane. Some leads give a lot of lip service and will act like they support you and are \"there\" for you but actually aren't.

Likely unintentional, but not a good look, Square.\n\n6 months prior to the huge layoff, upper management had made vague announcements about upcoming layoffs, but with no specifics.

Leadership at all levels should embody the qualities that attract and retain top talent.\n\t•\tEnsure that hiring managers are well-versed in company culture and values. Leaders need to not only understand these principles but also actively model and communicate them.\n\t•\tFoster a culture where employees and candidates feel heard, respected, and valued—this starts with clear communication, mutual respect, and accountability.\n\t•\tCreate structures to encourage and embrace innovation, ensuring employees feel comfortable sharing new ideas without fear of them being dismissed.\n\nFinal Thought:\nSquare and Block have immense potential to lead by example in the fintech industry, and their mission is worth believing in. With its strong foundation, Square has the opportunity to not only excel in financial technology but also set the standard for inclusive, value-driven workplaces. With stronger alignment in leadership, a renewed focus on respect and innovation, and hiring managers who embody these principles, the company could create an even more impactful and inspiring environment for its teams and candidates.",

This lack of openness diminished trust in the process.\n\t•\tInnovation: Suggestions for thinking outside the box during a role-play exercise were dismissed outright, which seemed contradictory to Block’s emphasis on creativity.\n\t•\tKnowledge Gaps: One of the interviewers did not know how to answer when asked how they foster a positive company culture. This is a red flag, as fostering culture is fundamental to a company’s leadership and values.",

My experience with them was detailed, thorough, and professional, setting a high standard for candidate engagement.\n\t•\tSquare has created groundbreaking products that genuinely help businesses thrive. Being part of a company that prioritizes empowerment and accessibility is inspiring.\n\t•\tDuring the interview process, I encountered a leader who truly embodied the values of empathy, inclusion, and innovation.

      "# [Block, Inc. by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2010-05-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.)\nAmerican financial services company\n\n\"Square, Inc.\" redirects here; not to be confused with Square (video game company).\n\nBlock, Inc. (formerly Square, Inc.[12]) is an American technology company and a financial services provider for consumers and merchants.[13][14][15] Founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey, it is the U.S. market leader in point-of-sale systems.[16][17][18] As of 2024, Block serves 57 million users and 4 million sellers,[19][20] processing $241 billion in payments annually.[4]\n\nBlock's inaugural product Square, launched in 2009, is a point-of-sale system.[16] It allows sellers to accept card payments and manage operations, including bookings,[21] e-Commerce,[22] inventory,[23] payroll,[24] banking, and obtaining business loans.[25] Additionally, Block's portfolio includes Cash App, a consumer-focused digital wallet introduced in 2013.[14][26] This app allows users to send, receive, save or borrow money,[27][28][29] access a debit card, invest in stocks and bitcoin,[30][31] and file taxes.[32] Block also owns Afterpay, a buy now, pay later business;[33] Bitkey, a self-custody bitcoin wallet;[34][35] Proto; a bitcoin mining system;[36][37] and Tidal, a music streaming business.[38]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n2009: Conception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original inspiration for Block's first product \"Square\" occurred to Jack Dorsey in 2009 when his friend Jim McKelvey was unable to complete a $2,000 sale of his glass faucets and fittings because he could not accept credit cards.[39] Co-founders Dorsey—who also co-founded Twitter—and McKelvey began developing the company out of a small office in St. Louis.[40] The name \"Square\" derives from the company's square-shaped card reader product.[41][42]\n\n2010–2014: Early years\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to Forbes, Block, named Square, Inc. then, tested its payment method on 50,000 merchants in the summer of 2010, and was reporting a chargeback rate of less than 0.05 percent.[43] In February 2011, Square was reportedly valued at approximately US$240 million, signing up 100,000 new merchants every month.[44] In April 2011, Square announced that it has secured an investment from Visa.[45] In October 2011, the company stated that it was processing about US$2 billion per year in payments through its \"Square\" card readers, charging 2.75 percent per swipe.[46]\n\nIn 2012, Starbucks and Square announced a partnership that would allow Starbucks to use the Square payment technology to accept payments for coffee. In the same year, Starbucks also reportedly invested in Square at a valuation of US$25 million.[47] Square was handling an annual payment volume of around US$6 billion around that time.[48]\n\nIn 2013, Square launched Cash App, a peer to peer payment service.[28] In October 2014, the company launched the integration of a payroll feature into its Square payment processing system, following the integrations of a merchant cash advance offering, a customer feedback product and an invoicing service into the system.[49]\n\n2015–2020: Initial public offering, growth\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, Square stated that it processed about US$23.8 billion worth of payment volume in 2014.[50] In the same year, the company sold shares in its initial public offering for US$9 per share, giving itself a market capitalization of $2.9 billion.[51]\n\nIn 2018, Vox reported Square as stating that over 7 million people used the Cash App in December 2017. Vox also stated that Cash App was the \"No. 1 free finance app\" in Apple's U.S. iPhone App Store and was \"ahead\" of PayPal and Venmo.[26]\n\nIn October 2020, Square put approximately 1% of their total assets ($50 million) in Bitcoin (4,709 bitcoins), citing Bitcoin's \"potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future\" as their main reasoning.[52] The company purchased approximately 3,318 bitcoins in February 2021 for a cost of around $170 million, bringing Square's total holdings to around 8,027 bitcoins (equivalent to around US$500 million in 2021, around US$481 million as of July 2024).[53]\n\n2021–2022: Name change, acquisitions\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 2, 2021, Square reached an agreement to acquire majority ownership in Tidal. Square paid $297 million in cash and stock for Tidal, with Jay-Z joining the company's board of directors. Jay-Z, as well as other artists who currently own stock in Tidal, will remain stakeholders.[54][55][56]\n\nOn December 1, 2021, Square announced that it would change its company name to Block, Inc. on December 10.[57][58] The change was announced shortly after Dorsey resigned as CEO of Twitter.[59] On December 10, 2021, the name change took effect, and Square, Inc. became Block, Inc.[60] On December 16, less than a week into the rebrand, H&R Block, sued the company for trademark infringement, claiming that the name seeks to confuse customers by misappropriating the Block brand name, which H&R owns.[61] The lawsuit was resolved in April 2023 when the two companies jointly agreed to dismiss the suit.[62]\n\nOn January 31, 2022, Block completed its acquisition of Afterpay, an Australian buy now, pay later (BNPL) lender.[63]\n\n2023–present: Business realignment\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2023, Afterpay suffered a service issue which led to a sudden reduction in the spending limits for many users. At least 2000 users reported experiencing a difficulty with the service. Afterpay acknowledged the problem and said it was working on a fix.[64] On September 7 and 8, 2023, Square and Cash App experienced outages, affecting thousands of users. Card payment processing, peer-to-peer payments and other transactions were among the impacted operations. On September 8, 2023, Block informed that the service disruptions had been resolved and all systems were operational by the afternoon of that day. It also said the outage was caused by an issue with the company's Domain Name System (DNS), and did not stem from a cyberattack.[65][66] In the following week, Block apologized to its customers and acknowledged “this situation was made more difficult by our communication”. To reduce the risk of a similar outage in future, the company said it had deployed a new set of firewall and DNS server changes, expanded offline payment capabilities so merchants can still accept payments in offline mode, and put in place additional measures.[67] Later in the month, Block said in a regulatory filing that the CEO of its Square business, Alyssa Henry, was set to leave the company in October 2023, and that Jack Dorsey, serving then as the \"Block Head\" and Chairperson, would take on an additional role of \"Square Head\".[68]\n\nIn February 2024, Block reported an annual \"Gross Payment Volume\" of US$228 billion and an annual income of $9.8 million for the year 2023.[6] In April 2024, CNBC reported that Block announced it had finished the development of its own standalone three-nanometer bitcoin mining chip and was in the process of working through the design with a semiconductor foundry. The company was also reported to be developing a \"full bitcoin mining system\", stating that its goal was to both decentralize the supply of bitcoin mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate — a proxy for industry competition and mining difficulty. In this regard, according to CNBC, Block was solving a \"major barrier to entry\" posed by the relative difficulty in sourcing mining rigs, their high prices and unpredictable delivery.[69] In May 2024, the company's Square platform was found to be the market leader in point-of-sale systems in the U.S.[18][17] In July 2024, Block signed a \"large-scale crypto mining hardware pact\", agreeing to supply its chips to bitcoin miner \"Core Scientific\". The company did not disclose financial details of the pact.[70][71] In September 2024, Block announced a leadership reshuffle, moving many longtime executives into more senior roles and creating a new position focused on customer safety. As part of these changes, Brian Grassadonia, formerly the CEO of Cash App,[72][73] was appointed as the company's new \"ecosystem lead\" to enhance coordination across Block's business sectors.[74]\n\nIn October 2024, Bitkey appeared in TIME's list of the \"best inventions of 2024\".[75][76] In November 2024, Fortune reported that Block was laying off many employees from its Tidal, TBD and Square services.[77] That same month, Block announced it was \"winding down\" TBD, \"scaling back\" investments in Tidal and focussing its resources on its bitcoin mining initiative as well as Bitkey, while adding that it was \"refining\" its investments based on progress.[78][79] The firm changed its stock ticker from SQ to XYZ in January 2025.[80][81]\n\nIn March 2025, Block announced to staff that they had plans to cut almost 1000 employees.[82]\n\nSubsidiaries, products, services\n\n[edit]\n\nSquare\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Square (payment system)\n\nSquare is a payments platform that allows businesses to accept card payments and use smartphones or tablets or computers as payment registers for a point-of-sale system (POS).[83][16][84] The platform was founded in 2009 by Dorsey and McKelvey. Square also offers additional features to manage various operations including staff payroll and shift schedules,[24] customer bookings,[21][85] inventory,[23] e-Commerce,[22][86][87] banking and business loans.[25]\n\nIn 2022, a Protocol survey showed that 35% of U.S. small business owners used Square, a higher percentage than its competitors, while also highlighting the POS market's continued fragmentation.[88] In April 2023, Square was reported to have 4 million merchants as its customers.[89][19] Its client base includes small and medium-sized businesses as well as larger ones.[90][15][91] As of 2024, the platform is available in the U.S., Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Republic of Ireland, Spain and the U.K.,[92] and is the U.S. market leader in point-of-sale systems.[18][17]\n\nCash App\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Cash App\n\nLaunched in October 2013, Cash App (formerly Square Cash) is a digital wallet which allows sending and receiving money, investing in stocks or bitcoin, and filing taxes.[14][27][28] In March 2015, the firm introduced Square Cash for businesses, which includes the ability for individuals, organizations, and business owners to use a unique username, known as a $cashtag, to send and receive money.[93] As of 2023, Cash App also offers a savings account and a debit card, and services such as direct deposit and investing in stocks and Bitcoin.[30][31] In March 2023, USA Today reported that Cash App offered a free tax-filing service while cautioning that it didn't accommodate \"every tax situation\" and didn't offer \"live tax support\".[32] In October 2023, it was reported that Cash App also allowed users to borrow up to $200 from the app, and that \"not everyone is an eligible user for this feature\".[29]\n\nCash App has been found to be the preferred payment app among lower-income adults in the U.S.,[94] reporting 57 million \"monthly active users\" as of 2024.[20][4]\n\nAfterpay\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Afterpay\n\nAfterpay is an Australian digital payment platform in which a bought product can be paid off in four installments. This idea made in 2008 by a then eighteen-year-old Nick Molnar was geared towards millennials and inspired by the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Molnar and Partner/ Co-founder Anthony Eisen launched their platform in 2014 and in four years their product reached a market capitalization of around $3.3 billion. In February 2020, Afterpay was reported to have 3.6 million active customers in the US, 3.1 million in Australia and New Zealand, and 600,000 in the UK. According to ABC News (Australia) in August 2021, Afterpay had operations in the U.S., Canada and New Zealand, as well as in the U.K., France, Italy and Spain as Clearpay.[95] In the same month, Afterpay and Block announced that Afterpay would be acquired by Block.[96] Block paid US$29 billion in stock for the acquisition and the process was finalized in January 2022. Molnar and Eisen continued to lead Afterpay's merchant and consumer businesses following the acquisition.[63][33] In 2024, Molnar was promoted to the role of the \"head of sales\", leading all sales activity at Block while reporting to Dorsey.[97][98][99]\n\nAs of 2023, Afterpay serves 24 million users and 348,000 merchants,[100][97] processing US$27.3 billion in payments annually.[101] It also ranks among the three most-used BNPL services globally.[102]\n\nBitkey\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Bitkey\n\nIn December 2023, Block launched Bitkey, a self-custody Bitcoin hardware wallet, in 95 countries including the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Nigeria, Argentina, Mexico, and India. The wallet allows investors to own, manage and store their Bitcoin without relying on third-party exchanges or custodians. Bitkey includes a mobile app, hardware device, and a set of recovery tools in case the customer loses the phone, their hardware or both. The wallet cannot access or move a customer's Bitcoin without them.[34][35][103] In October 2024, TIME named Bitkey as one of the \"best inventions of 2024\".[75][76]\n\nProto\n\n[edit]\n\nProto is Block's bitcoin mining system.[36][37] In April 2024, the company announced it was building a bitcoin mining system, aiming to decentralize both the supply of bitcoin mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate. The company also said it had finished developing its own standalone three-nanometer bitcoin mining chip and was finalizing the design with a semiconductor foundry.[69] In July 2024, Block signed an agreement to supply its chips to bitcoin miner \"Core Scientific\".[70][71] In February 2025, the company stated it was manufacturing chips with roll out plans later in the year, along with its mining system. The firm also said it was expecting Proto to contribute to Block's business growth in the second half of 2025.[36]\n\nTidal\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Tidal (service)\n\nTidal is a high-definition music streaming service with a catalog of over 100 million songs across various genres. It offers both a subscription plan and an ad-supported free plan.[104][105] Originally launched in 2014 by Aspiro, a Norwegian company, Tidal was purchased in 2015 by American rapper Jay-Z for $56 million, reportedly to \"give artists more control over the distribution of their music\".[106][107] At that time, Tidal was available in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Republic of Ireland, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.[104] In 2021, Block took majority ownership of Tidal for $297 million,[38] stating it aimed to find \"new ways for artists to support their work\" and to create \"tools that can help support musicians' businesses\".[108][107] Tidal was then operating in a streaming market dominated by Spotify and others, and was paying \"better royalty rates\" to artists than its rivals including Spotify.[109][108] In May 2023, Wired reported that Tidal's “Direct Artist Payouts” scheme, in which up to 10 percent of a user's subscription fee was delivered to the artists they listened to most, had been discontinued in 2022. According to Wired, the scheme was \"thoughtful\" and supportive of bands and artists, and its closure reduced some of Tidal's market differentiation.[105] In November 2024, Block announced it was \"scaling back\" investments in Tidal after reports emerged that the company was laying off Tidal employees.[78][79][77][110] Block added it was eliminating Tidal's product management and product marketing functions entirely and that Tidal would become a smaller entity, focusing on fewer areas while emphasizing product development.[110]\n\nFinancials\n\n[edit]\n\nBlock received angel investments from Marissa Mayer, Kevin Rose, Biz Stone, Dennis Crowley, Shawn Fanning, MC Hammer, and Esther Dyson.[citation needed] Since then, it has raised several additional rounds of funding:\n\nSeries A funding from Khosla Ventures[111]\n\nSeries B funding from Sequoia Capital[111]\n\nSeries C funding from Kleiner Perkins[111]\n\nSeries D funding from Citi Ventures, Rizvi Traverse Management, and Starbucks[112]\n\nSeries E funding from Goldman Sachs, Rizvi Traverse Management, and GIC Private Limited[113]\n\nThe company's valuation in October 2014 was $6 billion.[114] On November 19, 2015, Block had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial valuation of $2.9 billion, down by more than half from its last valuation in October 2014 at $6 billion. The series E funding shares had different rights than the common shares sold at the IPO, therefore the $6 billion 'valuation' from October 2014 is wrong. Although the firm was yet to make a profit as of 2015 and had lost $420 million since 2012, it had decreased its losses from 44% of revenues to 16% in the six months leading up to its IPO.[115] For the fiscal year 2018, Block reported losses of US$38 million, with an annual revenue of US$3.299 billion, an increase of 49.0% over the previous fiscal cycle. The company reported $24.12 billion in revenue, $892 million in operating income, $2.9 billion in net income and $240.81 billion in gross payment volume (GPV) for the year 2024. It also stated that it had 11,372 employees, $36.78 billion in total assets and $21.27 billion in total stockholders' equity by the end of the year.[4][5]\n\nYear[116] Revenue\n\nin mil.

In May 2020, Square announced that some of its workers would be allowed to be permanent remote workers.[122] As of 2021, although Block's real estate footprint remains intact, they no longer have a designated headquarters location.[2]\n\nFinancing and acquisitions\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2014, Victory Park Capital, an asset management firm, invested in Square Capital.[123] In May 2015, Square Capital raised additional funding, with Victory Park Capital tripling its initial investment.[124] As of 2016, Square had loaned $1 billion to companies through Square Capital since the program's inception.[125] On November 19, 2015, Square Inc. became a public company via an initial public offering.[126][127] On April 19, 2018, Square announced that it had acquired Zesty, a food delivery service that caters to corporate offices.[128][129] On April 26, 2018, Square announced that it would acquire Weebly, a website-building service, for $365 million.[130] In May 2019, Square announced that it had acquired Eloquent Labs, an artificial intelligence startup helping improve the customer service experience.[131]\n\nIn February 2020, Square announced that it had acquired Dessa, a Toronto-based deep learning company.[132] In November 2020, Square announced it was acquiring Credit Karma Tax, a free do-it-yourself tax-filing service, from Credit Karma for $50 million and would make it a part of its Cash App unit.[133] In March 2021, Square announced it was acquiring a significant majority in music streaming platform Tidal for $293 million in a deal of stock and cash.[134] In the same month, Square's Q1 sales surged 266% as transactions jumped amid economic recovery.[135] In August 2021, Square announced its acquisition of Afterpay, a company offering a \"buy now, pay later\" service. Square finalized the $29 billion stock deal on January 31, 2022.[136][63]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nAllegations of illegal activity\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 23, 2023, investment research firm Hindenburg Research disclosed a short position in Block, leading to a 15% drop in the company's shares that day. Hindenburg's accusations of Block included exaggerating user counts, failing to curb fraud and illegal activity on Cash App, and permitting impersonation of high-profile individuals. It also wrote in its report that Block \"embraced predatory offerings and compliance worst practices in order to fuel growth and profit from facilitation of fraud against consumers and the government.\"[137][138]\n\nBlock responded to the allegations in a press release saying, \"We intend to work with the SEC and explore legal action against Hindenburg Research for the factually inaccurate and misleading report they shared about our Cash App business today\".[139]\n\nNBC News reported in May 2024 that prosecutors at the Southern District of New York were examining financial transactions and internal practices at Block, stemming from alleged compliance lapses at its Square and Cash App units. According to the report, the company allegedly failed to collect adequate information from customers, processed transactions involving countries subject to economic sanctions, and processed cryptocurrency transactions for terrorist groups.[140] In November 2024, Block disclosed in its earnings report for July–September 2024 that it was negotiating a potential settlement with several state regulators that had probed the company's anti-money laundering program. Additionally, Block stated it was negotiating a potential settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in matters including those related to Cash App's handling of customer complaints and disputes. The company added it had accrued a liability for estimated amount in connection with each potential settlement and the amount was not material to the company's financial statements as of September 30, 2024.[141][142]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",

(NYSE: SQ) n/k/a (NYSE: XYZ) began to learn of potentially adverse information about the company and its Square and Cash App platforms on Mar. 23, 2023, when Hindenburg Research published a scathing report on the company.\n\nAfter a 2-year investigation, which included dozens of interviews with former employees, partners, and industry experts, Hindenburg concluded, in part, that Block had “wildly overstated its genuine user counts” and “[c]ore to the issue is that Block has embraced one traditionally ‘underbanked’ segment of the population: criminals.”\n\nOn February 4, 2024, NBC News reported that federal regulators were probing allegations of two Whistleblowers that Cash App performed inadequate due diligence on its users –including “‘no effective procedure to establish the[ir] identity’” – opening the door to potential money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illegal and illicit activities.\n\nThen, on May 1, 2024, NBC News reported that federal prosecutors were investigating Block due to allegations by a former employee that the Company had engaged in widespread and years-long compliance lapses at its two main units, Square and Cash App. Reportedly, the employee had provided prosecutors with internal Company documents demonstrating that Block had failed to conduct basic due diligence on its customers, that Square had processed thousands of transactions involving countries subject to economic sanctions (including Cuba, Iran, Russia, and Venezuela), and that Block had processed multiple cryptocurrency transactions for terrorist groups.\n\nThese developments have driven the price of Block shares significantly lower.

Then, on Jan. 16, 2025, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) ordered Block to pay $175 million and fix its failures on Cash App user fraud. The CFPB said Cash App attempted to avoid investigative obligations by tricking its users and that Cash App was vulnerable to criminals defrauding users.\n\nFurther related regulatory actions is possible. Block stated in its most recent Form 10-Q quarterly report filed in November, that it “also received inquiries from the SEC and Department of Justice (“DOJ”) shortly after the publication of a short seller report in March 2023. In July 2024, the Company received a follow-on inquiry from the SEC. The Company believes these inquiries primarily relate to the allegations raised in the short seller report, the Company’s compliance and risk practices, and related disclosures. The Company continues to cooperate with both agencies. The Company is unable to predict the likely outcome of these matters and cannot provide any assurance that the SEC or DOJ will not ultimately take legal action against the Company or that the outcome of any such action, if brought, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.”\n\nBlock, Inc.

The stock dropped more than 6% in extended trading.\n\nHere is how the company did, compared to analysts' consensus estimates from LSEG.\n\nEarnings per share: 71 cents adjusted vs. 87 cents expected\n\nRevenue: $6.03 billion vs. $6.29 billion expected\n\nRevenue increased about 4.5% from $5.77 billion a year earlier.\n\nBlock, formerly known as Square, posted $2.31 billion in gross profit, a 14% increase from $2.03 billion a year ago. The company, which was an early leader in providing point-of-sale systems for smaller businesses, faces increased competition from the likes of Toast and Fiserv's Clover unit.\n\nGross payment volume came in at $61.95 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $61.3 billion, according to StreetAccount. Block posted adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of $757 million, topping the $740 million average analyst estimate.\n\nBlock said it expects to deliver gross profit growth this year of 15% to $10.22 billion and adjusted operating income of $2.1 billion for a margin of 21%.\n\nBlock's payments business has expanded beyond traditional point-of-sale transactions to include lending and financial services. In 2021, the company acquired Australian buy now, pay later firm Afterpay for $29 billion, integrating the service into Cash App and Square's ecosystem. This week, Afterpay on the Cash App card begins rolling out.\n\nChief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja told CNBC the product launch aims to provide customers with more credit options and positions Cash App as a banking alternative for some customers.\n\nCEO Jack Dorsey said on the earnings call that combining more services like Cash App and Afterpay creates increased spending and engagement.\n\n\"We have a huge base of Cash Card customers that we can deploy this to,\" he said. \"We can do that extremely quickly. It's easy to roll out for us and alert people proactively of entirely new utility that they can use that day, instantly.\"\n\nAnalysts see lending as a key driver of future monetization, with some pointing to additional revenue opportunities in merchant services and advertising within Cash App. The unit recorded $1.38 billion in gross profit, a 16% year-over-year increase, exceeding the $1.36 billion average analyst estimate, according to StreetAccount.\n\nDorsey also articulated the long-term vision of integrating Cash App and Square into a single financial ecosystem, reducing the need for users to rely on multiple apps.\n\n\"There will be a significant reason to use Cash App and not have to go to the App Store for 10 different apps,\" he said. \"Everything is in one app, and that will be the Cash App.\"\n\nUnder Dorsey's leadership, Block made a big jump into bitcoin, including a years-long effort to design and build mining rigs.\n\nBlock's open bitcoin mining system is called Proto. Ahuja said on the earnings call that the company expects the initiative to start benefitting growth in the second half of 2025.\n\nDorsey has long said Block's goal is to open bitcoin mining up to the masses.\n\n\"We do think the market is large, and we do think we're poised to take a significant percentage of it,\" Dorsey said.\n\nHe added that Block is manufacturing chips that it plans to roll out this year, along with its full mining systems.\n\n\"This year is gonna be one of unexpected upside in this business, and one that we significantly change the market dynamics on because of just how well our system works and how configurable it is,\" he said.\n\n— CNBC's Robert Hum contributed to this report.",

      "# [Hagens Berman National Law Firm on 2020-04-22](https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/block-inc-xyz-securities-class-action)\nHagens Berman has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for institutional and individual investors defrauded by unscrupulous management of publicly held corporations.\n\nSound investment decisions can only be made when you have full disclosure of accurate information. No money manager, retirement fund or individual investor should suffer undue risk or incur losses due to misrepresentations related to the investment at issue.\n\nHagens Berman is a leading provider of specialized securities litigation services to public, private and Taft-Hartley pension funds. We offer proprietary and unparalleled asset protection and recovery services to both foreign and domestic institutions. Our institutional services provide participants with the ability to identify, investigate and react to potential wrongdoing by companies they invest in. We represent investors under the federal securities laws and other investor-protection statutes created to recover funds lost due to fraudulent representations made to investors.\n\nSECURITIES LITIGATION\n\nHagens Berman represents shareholders in securities and financial fraud cases and is one of the nation’s leading firms in this area. Securities litigation has been one of the cornerstones of Hagens Berman’s practice since the inception of our firm. We have recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for institutional and individual investors defrauded by unscrupulous management of publicly held corporations.\n\nOur securities practice seeks to advise clients on both individual and class-action cases under the federal securities laws. We work for investors impacted by poor corporate governance, breach of fiduciary duties, or a failure of good faith, fair dealing or loyalty. The firm vigorously pursues fraud recovery litigation, forcing corporate officers, directors and fund managers to answer to their investors.\n\nHagens Berman has represented investors in securities litigation against some of the nation’s largest corporations. For instance, the firm was appointed lead counsel in a case representing Bank of America shareholders following a plunge in the banking giant’s stock price when it disclosed a $10 billion lawsuit threat from American International Group (AIG).\n\nA TRACK RECORD OF PROTECTING INVESTORS\n\nOne of our proudest cases in this area was the Charles Schwab Securities Litigation where we recovered 45 percent and 82 percent of investor losses for two different classes, totaling $245 million. Recoveries equal to such high percentages of losses are rare, and our competitors often settle for pennies on the dollar rather than what investors deserve.\n\nHagens Berman is currently involved in active securities litigation in a number of cases in various jurisdictions throughout the United States. Many securities firms settle early for a very small percentage, often less than five percent, of investors’ losses. Hagens Berman prosecutes cases with the goal of obtaining the greatest recovery possible, and has settled cases or obtained verdicts equal to a much greater percentage of losses.",

    "# Comprehensive Report on Block, Inc. and Square\n\n## Company Overview\n\nBlock, Inc. (formerly known as Square, Inc.) is an American technology and financial services company founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey. The company is headquartered in San Francisco and is recognized as a leader in point-of-sale systems in the U.S. As of 2024, Block serves approximately 57 million users and 4 million sellers, processing around $241 billion in payments annually [(Wikimedia, 2010-05-14)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\nBlock's portfolio includes several products, with Square being its inaugural offering. Square is a point-of-sale system that enables sellers to accept card payments and manage various business operations, including e-commerce, payroll, and inventory management. Other notable products include Cash App, Afterpay, Bitkey, and Proto, which focus on digital payments, buy now, pay later services, cryptocurrency management, and bitcoin mining, respectively [(Wikimedia, 2010-05-14)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n## Product Overview: Square\n\nSquare is a comprehensive payments platform that allows businesses to accept card payments and utilize smartphones, tablets, or computers as payment registers. The platform also offers features for managing payroll, customer bookings, inventory, and e-commerce [(Wikimedia, 2010-05-14)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.). As of 2024, Square is the market leader in point-of-sale systems in the U.S., with a reported 4 million merchants using the service [(Wikimedia, 2010-05-14)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Acquisitions and Partnerships\n\nBlock has made significant acquisitions to expand its service offerings. In 2021, the company acquired Tidal, a music streaming service, for $297 million, with Jay-Z joining Block's board of directors [(Wikimedia, 2010-05-14)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.). In January 2022, Block completed its acquisition of Afterpay, an Australian buy now, pay later service, for $29 billion, integrating it into the Cash App and Square ecosystem [(Wikimedia, 2010-05-14)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n### Financial Performance\n\nBlock's financial performance has shown growth, although it has faced challenges. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported revenue of $6.03 billion, which was below analysts' expectations of $6.29 billion. Despite this, gross payment volume reached $61.95 billion, exceeding estimates [(MacKenzie Sigalos, CNBC, 2025-02-20)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/20/block-xyz-earnings-q4-2024.html). For the fiscal year 2024, Block reported $24.12 billion in revenue and a net income of $2.9 billion, with a gross payment volume of $240.81 billion [(Wikimedia, 2010-05-14)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n### Leadership Changes\n\nIn September 2024, Block announced a leadership reshuffle, with Brian Grassadonia appointed as the new \"ecosystem lead\" to enhance coordination across Block's business sectors. Alyssa Henry, the CEO of Square, is set to leave the company in October 2023, with Jack Dorsey taking on additional responsibilities as \"Square Head\" [(Wikimedia, 2010-05-14)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n## Controversies and Challenges\n\nBlock has faced scrutiny and allegations regarding its compliance practices. In March 2023, Hindenburg Research published a report accusing Block of exaggerating user counts and failing to curb fraud on its Cash App platform. This led to a significant drop in the company's stock price [(Hagens Berman, 2025-01-27)](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/27/3015582/0/en/Block-Inc-XYZ-Faces-Securities-Class-Action-Regulators-Levy-Cash-App-Fines-Following-Investigations-Going-Back-to-Hindenburg-Report-Hagens-Berman.html). Additionally, federal regulators have been investigating Block for alleged compliance lapses, including inadequate due diligence on customers and processing transactions for individuals in sanctioned countries [(Hagens Berman, 2025-01-27)](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/27/3015582/0/en/Block-Inc-XYZ-Faces-Securities-Class-Action-Regulators-Levy-Cash-App-Fines-Following-Investigations-Going-Back-to-Hindenburg-Report-Hagens-Berman.html).\n\n## Future Outlook\n\nLooking ahead, Block aims to enhance its product offerings and streamline operations. CEO Jack Dorsey has emphasized the importance of integrating Cash App and Square into a single financial ecosystem, which could reduce the need for multiple applications for users [(MacKenzie Sigalos, CNBC, 2025-02-20)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/20/block-xyz-earnings-q4-2024.html). The company is also focusing on its bitcoin mining initiative, with plans to roll out new mining systems and chips in 2025 [(MacKenzie Sigalos, CNBC, 2025-02-20)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/20/block-xyz-earnings-q4-2024.html).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBlock, Inc. is a significant player in the financial technology sector, with a diverse range of products and a strong user base. However, it faces challenges related to compliance and competition. Prospective candidates and investors should consider both the growth potential and the risks associated with the company's operations and market position."
