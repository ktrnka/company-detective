The only downside of .xyz is, that its by default considered SPAM because a lot of people registered numeric .xyz and used it to SPAM the shit out of it, because they cost like a dollar per year.

Just today I got a text from a sender who claimed to be the US Postal Service about some package from outside the country being held up in customs.  The link that the text message instructed me to follow was \"us-usps-*jibberish*-.xyz/i\"   I am going to state here that any time the domain seems odd, its most likely a scam or phishing attempt.  The US Postal service has a domain that they use for everything so it seems like a no-brainer.  DO NOT click it or copy/paste, etc.   Now with that said, it's not simply a problem of any business using .xyz, but it is a problem with a sender claiming to be someone I do transact with asking me to follow a link to a domain that has a questionable address/URL.\n\nI am sure I am not the first to warn you about this kind of thing.\n\nCarry on and stay safe my friends.

      "# Post ID tbthjj: [PSA] Newer TP-Link Routers send ALL your web traffic to 3rd party servers... with +2029 score by [(ArmoredCavalry, Reddit, 2022-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/tbthjj/psa_newer_tplink_routers_send_all_your_web/)\nI recently enabled a DNS gateway to be able to see requests from my router, and network devices. Was surprised to find 80K + requests (in 24 hours) out to an Avira \"Safe Things\" subdomains `*.safethings.avira.com` (far more than any other server).\n\nDigging into this more, I found that it is related to the built-in router security \"Home Shield\" that ships with newer TP-Link routers - [https://oem.avira.com/en/solutions/safethings-for-router-manufacturers](https://oem.avira.com/en/solutions/safethings-for-router-manufacturers)\n\nHere is the kicker though, I have the Avira / Home Shield services completely turned off (I wasn't even subscribed to their paid service for it). The router doesn't care, and sends ALL your traffic to be \"analyzed\" anyhow. See this response from TP Link (towards bottom of review) from last year - [https://www.xda-developers.com/tp-link-deco-x68-review/#:\\~:text=TP%2DLink%20says%20the%20network%20activity](https://www.xda-developers.com/tp-link-deco-x68-review/#:~:text=TP%2DLink%20says%20the%20network%20activity) Update: I emailed reviewer to confirm TP-Link never updated him after.\n\nI contacted support about this again, and was given a non-answer about how the requests are to check subscription status. 80K + requests a day to check subscription status? Why would it even need to do 1 single subscription check, if I'm not enabling any functionality that is behind a subscription paywall? Also the rate of requests is not constant, it is higher when my internet traffic is higher. To me this lack of consistent answer / response from TP-Link is as concerning as the requests themselves.\n\nI'm not seeing much online about this issue, as I don't think many people realize it is even occurring (since traffic is outgoing straight from router, as opposed to an individual computer). Hoping to gain some attention on this issue and get a real answer / response from TP-Link about what exactly is going on here. As well as a **concrete timeline** and promise for a fix to stop these outgoing requests, when we aren't even using their anti-virus services.\n\nEdit: Additional details, this is on their WiFI 6 AX3000 (Archer AX55) Router. From the XDA Review looks like this is also happening on their Deco series. If you want to easily check your own router, you can use any DNS Gateway ([NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/), [Cloudflare Gateway](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/gateway/) Pi-Hole etc.) Just be sure to set the DNS servers under \"Advanced->Network->Internet->Advanced Settings\" because the DHCP DNS server setting will only apply to the devices inside the network, not the router itself.\n\nEdit #2: I've also contacted Avira directly regarding the endpoints, in the hope that they'll be more straightforward than TP-Link about the purpose. Will update here when I receive a response. Update: Avira support got back to me and said they couldn't answer any questions because I'm not a paying customer. So they can collect data, for free, but not tell me what the data is...\n\nEdit #3: If anyone knows of good industry contacts, who can dig into this more or get real answers, please send a message! I've seen GamerNexus brought up a few times, but don't see any contact method.\n\n# Update: Temporary Fix!\n\nDiscovered this late, but in case someone gets here from Google, etc. I noticed that if I block the `*.safethings.avira.com` subdomains, then **reboot the router**, this seems to prevent it going into the retry-loops when DNS lookup fails. There must be a flag that is set in-memory if the first time the router is ever able to successfully contact the domains? Rebooting after blocking prevents this flag ever getting set. So without the retries involved, this hugely reduced the router CPU usage when blocking for me. The router is actually now attempting requests less than when not blocked at all.\n\n# Beta Firmware Update\n\nTP-Link has posted links to beta firmware that claims to fix the issue. Note:  It hasn't been verified whether the update actually reduces requests to Avira, or simply caches the DNS query (then makes requests directly to IP) - [https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/3329/](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/3329/)\n\n# Press Release by TP-Link Korea\n\nThanks to /u/Lord_Buffum for sharing this - [https://www.tp-link.com/kr/press/news/19964/](https://www.tp-link.com/kr/press/news/19964/)\n\nEssentially they say that the *frequency* (not existence) of DNS requests is a bug that will be fixed, but never explain  **WHY** the router needs to contact Avira with HomeShield disabled. To me this adds almost no reassurance or new info. We already knew Avira is used for HomeShield, and that DNS lookups to Avira are to get the IP address. What we don't know is 1) Why the requests are being made with the service disabled, and 2) What data is even being sent in the requests (and why). Translated relevant bits below -\n\n1. TP-Link HomeShield uses AVIRA services to protect its customers' networks from cybersecurity threats. AVIRA is a global cybersecurity software company based in Germany, now a brand of the Norton LifeLock group ([www.avira.com](http://www.avira.com)).\n\n>Because this service operates by accessing the AVIRA Cloud service, the router periodically checks the AVIRA Cloud IP address. The router sent a DNS query to check this IP address. In order for the router to continue to use AVIRA cloud services, ***it is necessary to periodically send DNS queries as it must be able to access AVIRA's IP***.  \n>  \n>However, as a result of examining the software, we found a defect in the DNS request logic where requests occur frequently, and our TP-Link has optimized the software to reduce such frequent queries. Customers will be able to update the firmware of these products soon.  \n>  \n>2. DNS query is to query a domain name, and send a DNS request to request the domain name of the AVIRA server.  \n>  \n>As a DNS query, no personal information is included in these requests.\n\n## Comment ID i097j3i with +252 score by [(ArmoredCavalry, Reddit, 2022-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/tbthjj/psa_newer_tplink_routers_send_all_your_web/i097j3i/) (in reply to ID tbthjj):\nI also have tried blocking / redirecting the DNS queries, but this results in the router getting stuck in retry loop (thousands of requests a minute), and a big spike in router CPU usage as a side effect.

Including if the DNS query fails.\n\nI tried standing up my own fake server and redirecting the DNS queries to it, to try to inspect the requests, but it appears to do certificate validation and will refuse to connect (which in a way is *kinda* good...

Remote connecting to PC 10 km apart results in 100 ms of delay. Plus they scan all your requests and warn you when you try to open website that they think is malicious. Add the constant telemetry from everything including Windows, antiviruses etc and the TP-Link issue doesn't seem that outrageous...\n\nAt this point I think we NEED a law that forces companies to let you easily turn off ALL the traffic that is not essential to the device/app to work correctly.

Or when I open Google Maps and it automatically opens the city they think I'm in - which is the city the traffic is routed to by ISP before going into internet.

You probably should look into stepping up your game into actual small business/prosumer wireless gear. Aruba, Ubiquti, etc... \n\nGet a nice PoE switch in your garage rack, setup a wireless controller, and buy a few APs from them. I'm a fan of Unifi's in-wall aps. https://store.ui.com/products/unifi-in-wall-hd. You can probably figure out a nice clean mounting solution with your current ethernet jacks in each room. You'd just trunk your vlans to the APs, and in the wireless controller set your SSIDs to use <x> tag for each network. Use PFSense to filter intervlan traffic and do the actual routing. If you have wired backhaul everywhere, might as well have good wifi coverage all throughout the house. \n\nYou can always just do baby steps. Spin up a VM/Docker container (or buy their little hardware dongle controller) for the wireless controller, and just stick a single big AP where your current one is.

As I was going thru the settings when I first got it (as I do with literally every electronic device I get - review every single setting of every single settings page), I noticed it had an IP address pre-programmed for the WAN DNS. I first set it to DHCP and then rebooted the router, only to find that IP was back in the WAN DNS after reboot. [pingtool.org](https://pingtool.org) revealed the IP is located in China. Next, I set the WAN DNS to [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) instead of the pre-programmed IP, rebooted and it saved the [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) setting after reboot.

It correlates up / down depending on internet traffic. I'll add to this main post.\n\nI have two TP-Link routersP\n\nArcher C4000\n\nArcher AX4400\n\nThe C4000 is retired due to lack of firmware updates.  Got the AX4400 as my first WiFi 6 router.  It's a slightly slower version of the AX73.  The last firmware update was July 11, 2022.  As far as stability, I like TP-Link routers, my main concern was lack of firmware updates.  I replaced the AX4400 with an Asus RT-AX86U, but even as someone who's good with computers, and tech, and has some formal training, the Asus still feels overwhelming with all it's features.  So, I have kept the AX4400 (with updated firmware) as a backup in case I want to go back to a more simple setup.  Also I own a 6th Gen Airport Extreme router, and after doing some research on those, I found from various reports in the Macrumors forums that, they are still secure today, but the main hangup is because they are older hardware, their speed isn't up to modern ISP plans.  (especially over wireless) since it's a first gen WiFi 5 device.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I have two routers as alternatives.  I was also told by people on the smallnetbuilder forums that That I'd probably be more secure with my TP-Link router as Asus is targeted more in attacks.  So far the Asus has been working well, but it can have issues with my smart bulbs.  However, that seems to be pretty much resolved at this point.",

FromSoftware is like Black Sabbath. Black Sabbath took a lot of elements from here and there and turned it into something that had never been done before. Individually, those elements were not unique. But the final product was a sound that was new. Just like FromSoft games felt like nothing you had ever played before.   \n  \nBands came along and took a lot of influence from Sabbath over the years.  Judas Priest, Motorhead, Metallica, Pantera, Slipknot, At The Gates, Korn, System of a Down, Gojira, Mastodon....the list goes on. Many of those bands sound very little like each other. But they are all, undeniably, metal bands.\n\nBlack Myth Wukong is a soulslike. And there is nothing wrong with that. It's looking like it could be a Pantera level Soulslike too, turning the genre on it's head and making other developes (or bands in my analogy) think \"holy shit that is insane.\"\n\n## Comment ID lbe80ub with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMythWukong/comments/1du54c4/black_myth_is_not_like_xyz_game_you_can_compare/lbe80ub/) (in reply to ID 1du54c4):\n1.

One of the Perks of the Various Stances is to Counter Attack.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/kywklfpcc8ad1.gif\n\nNotice that the Enemy's Stepping Attack is immediately countered by a special move.\n\nThat is one of the Special moves from the Stances.\n\nSo while your basic attack is going to be the same, changing stances does allow you to mix up gameplay besides unleashing Heavy Attack.\n\n5. The Heavy Attacks in the Game work differently from other games.\n\nIn most normal actions you'll be mixing light and heavy attacks into every combo.\n\nIn Black Myth, Heavy Attacks requires Attacking Enemies with Light attack/ Perfect Dodges/ Deflecting Projectiles to earn 'Combo Points' which you can spend on Heavy Attacks. These moves also usually does big damage and staggers the Enemy/Boss. You can also Charge up by HOLDING the Heavy Attack button, but this leaves you vulnerable.\n\n#### Comment ID lbeb3mg with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMythWukong/comments/1du54c4/black_myth_is_not_like_xyz_game_you_can_compare/lbeb3mg/) (in reply to ID lbeadph):\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9q5hci0we8ad1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ae1835c2eb92ce4049c7af2b009870261f72267\n\n6.

Pick model A, model B. \n2. Choose the first 'master' preset that has the type of merge you imagine, e.g. \"Structure A, Detail B\" or \"Structure A, Style B\" or \"Roughly 50/50\", etc. \n3. Generate a stack of images using a prompt file and choose one master preset to proceed with.\n4. Scroll down in the list to the 'subtle' versions of that master preset, which has small changes. The variations are many because there are many possibilities:\n   1. general strength of model a/b +/- \n   2. structure / detail from model a/b +/- effectively moving the pattern by layer offset up, +/-1 layer\n   3. large structure / detail / style by 1st order asymmetry +/- across in/out\n   4. subtle structure / detail / style by 2nd order asymmetry +/- across in, across out, or both.\n5.

GradV/GradA, Cosine/Reverse Cosine are more useful than all the rest of the presets. Occasionally the hermite - roughly 50/50 with a swish up or down at the start/end are useful.\n2. Often, the presets are too strong on their own. When they're too strong, they need scaling down, to make, for example, 'GradV mild' which starts at 0.5 and drops to 0.\n3. Often, the presets are too weak on their own, and need shifting up or down. A bit like combining WRAP with GradV or Cosine, so it rises to 1 then stays at 1 for the last 5 layers.\n4. Symmetry works well - if you include some weight in e.g OUT8, include some weight in IN3 and it seems to get stronger / more coherent, I guess due to skips.\n5. Smooth bumps work better than adjusting a group of layers to 1 or 0. WRAP/RING etc all need tapering to get coherent merges.\n6. Smoothstep variants are all confusing and don't seem to be particularly useful. If they had more memorable names and some were more symetrical, perhaps they'd be better?\n7. Ideally there would be a visual output, or a spline that you could drag up and down.\n\n### Comment ID kbfbr9d with +1 score by [(ShatalinArt, Reddit, 2023-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kbfbr9d/) (in reply to ID kbevanw):\nTo get a 0.5 merge effect, I use a trick like this.\n\nModel A merge Model B = Model C\n\nI usually use Cosine/Reverse Cosine\n\nThen:\n\nModel A merge Mode C = Model D\n\nModel D - will get a merge effect of about 0.5-0.6\n\n#### Comment ID kbfe4wu with +1 score by [(Luke2642, Reddit, 2023-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kbfe4wu/) (in reply to ID kbfbr9d):\nInteresting, thanks!\n\nSo if I understand, you like cosine/reverse cosine, but you find they're too strong.

Use runtime merge block weights and play with the sliders.\n\nPut a prompt in, set batch to 4 of 512x512 so you can iterate quickly. Fix the seed. Generate the same batch for two different models, two models that look very different, perhaps a cartoon and a photo real.\n\nHowever, you'll also notice the structure changes, the composition of each image in the batch will be different between the two models. Arms legs pose framing etc.\n\nSo, with the seed fixed, set A as cartoon and B as photo real, and slowly increase one slider at a time until you have a model that generates the composition of the original cartoon batch but looks photo real.\n\nWork your way down top to bottom on both sides at once, because the skip connections are really important. That's why FreeU has such a big impact.\n\nYou'll probably notice that the highest 1-5 layers can often be set 50-100% and the lowest 1-3 layers can be set quite high, something like 25% to 50%, but that somewhere in the lower half and middle, it'll be really sensitive for 3-4 layers on both the input and output. Raising those sliders suddenly gives B composition not A. You've identified \"structure\" versus \"detail\" for that pair of models, for that 1 prompt.\n\nIt can vary quite a bit across different prompts, depending on what each model was trained on, similar or different.\n\nFor most of the cartoon versus photoreal models you'll see a kind of approximate hour glass shape on both sides, but it varies enormously with spikes.\n\nYou can then save out that model, and then make softer mixes. Use it with a gradA, gradV, cosine, rev cosine, or flat strength mix with either of the original models to tone it up or down. \n\nHappy merging!\n\n## Comment ID kc3ubqy with +1 score by [(HarmonicDiffusion, Reddit, 2023-12-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kc3ubqy/) (in reply to ID 187kuzi):\nThank you for providing your research here, it has definitely made me think about some things in a new light!\n\n### Comment ID kc42l0m with +3 score by [(Luke2642, Reddit, 2023-12-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kc42l0m/) (in reply to ID kc3ubqy):\nNo problem, hope it is helpful! :-)\n\nAnother thing that helped improve my intuition was the slow process of trying to merge two checkpoints together, using the goal of \"the maximum amount of model 2 without changing X from model 1\"... testing using a batch of a few 512x512 seeds.\n\nX can be structure, colours, style, etc\n\nIt takes about 20 minutes of moving the sliders one at a time, generating and checking, one by one, up to 50%, then if that works, to 75%, but if it messes up the composition, down to 25%, then move on to the next slider.\n\nOnce you're done, if you merge the result in with model 2 at a low strength, like 20%, strength, you'll still get some of X from model 1 in a nice version of model 2 that hasn't been screwed up by a strong merge.\n\nThe thing I haven't figured out yet is how to use add difference more effectively. It's great for adding inpainting to a model but it mostly just screws up models even at low weights, even if you do know what model it was trained from, and use low weights. I'm sure there's more potential there.\n\n#### Comment ID ktiq004 with +1 score by [(HarmonicDiffusion, Reddit, 2024-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/ktiq004/) (in reply to ID kc42l0m):\nwould love to hear anything new you have discovered!  do you have a discord, blog, etc?",

This is all still very new to me.  I may not have all my facts right.  I might not use the correct term for something.  If you know more than I do, let me know!  Put a correction in the comments, I’ll update this post to be as accurate as possible.\n\nDespite my n00bness, I’ve learned some interesting things through my explorations with Stable Diffusion, especially when it comes to the nature of seeds, and I hope that you find some of this worth your time.  In any case, I didn’t know what else to title this post, so A Seed Tutorial it is.\n\nBefore I go any further, I want to acknowledge u/wonderflex for their really great tutorial on how seed selection affects your final image.  It started me thinking about seeds and better image control and gave me the insight I needed to take their idea to the next level.  That post is located here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/x8szj9/tutorial\\_seed\\_selection\\_and\\_the\\_impact\\_on\\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/x8szj9/tutorial_seed_selection_and_the_impact_on_your/)\n\n\\[A quick side note:  For the purposes of the rest of this tutorial, I’m using Euler\\_a at 20 steps.\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo - What is a seed?\n\nI’ve read information on the web that describes a seed as “a number that controls all the randomness that happens during the generation”.  This is only partially true.  There’s nothing random about it except the seed you start with, and sometimes not even then.\n\n\" A seed is a number, but if you ask the computer to make you a random image made up of random pixels, then the image you receive will be entirely dependent on what seed you use immediately before asking for an image made up of random colors. If we use the same seed and then ask for the same width x height of random colors, we'll get exactly the same \"random\" image on our two different computers. In this way, the seed corresponds 1:1 with the starting image / noise that SD will start working with.\n\nThe seed number is turned into an image by determining the sequence of \"random\" numbers that will be used, and following a fixed procedure to turn random numbers into an image.  Each seed value produces a unique starting noise image. \"  -- Helpful Redditor\n\nThis is how you are able to generate the exact same image as another user by using the exact same settings with the same seed.  This could not happen if it were random.\n\nWhy is this an important distinction?  Because outside of numerology, we don’t attribute values, personalities, shapes or colors to numbers.  Images however, are different.  We can describe them using all those attributes.  u/wonderflex refers to this as the “flavor” or “theme” of the seed.  Again, why is this important?\n\n***Because the theme of a given seed may be completely incompatible with your prompt***\n\nThat doesn't mean you can't crank up the CFG (more on that later) to force it - but you probably will not be happy with the results.  When a sculptor carves a dragon out of stone, they don’t just choose any old piece of rock… they search for a piece that is the right size, right color, and has a shape similar to the final product.  They look to find a stone that already has a dragon within it, making their vision easier to attain.  But some pieces simply don’t have a dragon in them to begin with.  By the same token, some seeds don’t have a dragon in them either.\n\n***If you want an awesome dragon, it's easier if you start with a seed that might contain one.***\n\nSo now we get to the good stuff.  How do you find out the “theme” of a seed?  How do you see its initial image?  Luckily it’s super easy.  Just use your favorite txt2img generator, enter in the seed you’d like to see and hit generate, leaving the prompt blank.\n\nIf you do this right now and type in 8675309 for the seed at 1 step, you will get this image:\n\n[Seed 8675309 - 1 Step](https://preview.redd.it/0yz35whv0oo91.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd4b7775997dcbae425fcd9734da3512a063012e)\n\nAnd if you run it again at 20 steps, the computer has shaped it into this:\n\n[Seed 8675309 - 20 Steps](https://preview.redd.it/4bvodbbjyno91.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f57be0ca5e1f2c9187233f5e0620ddedecb5eaa)\n\nThese are not random images your computer spat out.  This is image seed #8675309 and it is the “theme” that forms the initial pass of every image generated from this seed.  (The amount of CFG, discussed in detail below, has no effect on the outcome since the prompt is blank).\n\nSo what do we notice about this theme?  What are its attributes?  Well at 1 step, it's hard to tell much of anything.  It's muted in color, hazy, has contrasting shadows and some sepia tones.  That's about it.\n\nBut look at the same image at Step 20.  Now we are seeing something!  And keep in mind, this is without any user input whatsoever... this is the way the AI wants to transform this seed.\n\nNow what do we know about it?  Well… it’s black and white.  It has a decent amount of ambient light.  It looks like the interior of a space… maybe a bedroom?  That could be a grid window in the background.  Left to its own devices, the AI wants this seed to represent a room of some kind at this step level.\n\nAt different step counts, the AI will continue to run progressive scans and modifying the image until you get to around 150 or so steps.  Just for fun, here's a grid of this seed taken from steps 10-200:\n\n[8675309 - Step Grid](https://preview.redd.it/6eyatyug4oo91.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c6c5fece20251508948d2157dc2393c468654ef)\n\nBecause the AI continues to modify the image, I'm going to only use steps 1 and 20 from here on, just to make things easier - especially if you're following along generating these same images yourself.\n\nSince it’s easier to describe things when we have other things to compare them to, let’s get several seeds at once.  Here are the images for seeds 0-5 at step 1, and then at step 20:\n\n[Seeds 0-5, Steps 1 & 20](https://preview.redd.it/ulc2f4sp5oo91.png?width=3456&format=png&auto=webp&s=610a52f43a8b74a253dc70389972cdad79a72669)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay NOW we have some stuff to talk about.  By comparing and contrasting them, we can more easily describe the theme of each seed.\n\nSeed 0:  This starts off like they all do - fuzzy.  It has some dramatic differences between light and dark.  By Step 20, the AI has decided to make the theme black and white and sorta want there to be... bottles? on a table maybe?  with a black couch and a window in a white room?\n\nSeed 1:  This theme starts off very brown, with openings and a platform / table / surface of some kind.  By 20, SD decided it should be what looks like the front of a stone church with arches in a square with a sandwich board sign? and people walking by a site wall and trees in the background.  Nice.\n\nSeed 2:  This starts out as a purple theme and stays that way.  While Step 1 reminds me for some reason of the tones H.R. Giger uses in his work, by Step 20, AI has gone a different route and decided it's purple clothing... or maybe a purple wig?\n\nSeed 3:  The AI took the muted colors from the 1 pass and by 20 has turned it into... what is that exactly... maybe an attic room with a window on the left and shelves on the right?  I dunno.\n\nSeed 4:  This is one of the most interesting of the Step 1 images.  It starts off looking like a super out-of-focus desert or prairie scene... could those be Saguaro cacti maybe?  And at step 20, we still have a very similar image.  Blue sky over plains with sand or a road and boulders maybe?  Looking like an impressionist / surrealist mashup here.  My guess is that given the persistence of this image, you would be hard pressed to get it to behave well if you wanted something with a radically different color or shape palette.\n\nSeed 5:  Starting off with a blurry possible high desert, red rocks & juniper tree look, it gets transformed into a patio with an L-shaped pool, a table with an umbrella maybe?  next to a house or some structure.  Nice little growie plant in the foreground right.\n\nSo now that we've analyzed that… how does each seed affect the generation of prompt output?This is where the CFG scale comes in.\n\nCFG stands for Classifier-Free Guidance (thanks you, u/bluevase1029), and while there are a lot of nebulous definitions floating around for what this actually does, in reality it is a setting that tells the AI *how much effort it should use to force your prompt onto the seed theme.*\n\nThe seed already has a theme, and if your prompt can be easily applied to that theme, then it can happen at fairly low CFGs.  But if your prompt is nothing like the theme, it requires a bit more force to make the damn AI listen to you, so the CFG needs to be raised.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo let's see this in action.  For the next several images, the top row is always going to be the theme - the blank AI-generated image based on the seed itself.  All images are create with 20 steps.  These are the prompts I used, in order:\n\n* young man, nature, city, anime, building\n\nI kept them intentionally vague because I'm trying to see how the AI will modify the original theme to fit my prompt.  By being overly descriptive, I influence things more than I want to at this point.  Also, this first image was created with a CFG of 1, so I'm giving the AI free reign to manipulate the theme as it sees fit to try and obey my prompt.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1o4nn4m9boo91.png?width=3456&format=png&auto=webp&s=63c53c8ee8ba8f4e3566444bfb4161942deabe08\n\nWow okay so check that out.  As a general comment, you'll see that every image stuck almost completely to the layout and composition of the original theme.  CFG 1 means the themes dictate creation completely.  The black-and-white scenes stayed black-and-white... the objects and shapes mostly retained their original positions.\n\nIf you're interested you can fine-tooth-comb that image and get all kinds of interesting data from it, but I'll highlight a couple.  With the \"young man\", it's fascinating how the AI created almost a papier-mâché version of a man from the highlights in seed 0.  Seed 1 has the \"young man\" as a daguerreotype due to the heavy influence of the brown / sepia tones.  Meanwhile the one in Seed 2 has retained the big purple hair from the blank.\n\nSeeds 1 & 4 lent themselves very well to the \"nature\" prompt already, and it's surprising how well Seed 2 did.  All of them made some super-interesting images of a \"city\", all sticking to their roots, but all having completely different solutions as to what a city might be.\n\nSo what does this tell you?\n\nWell what it tells me, is that if I want to create a desert-pueblo-style city, I would be much better off starting with Seed 4 than any of the others.  It would most likely give me better results faster, be more consistent, and not frustrate the hell out of me!\n\nNow let's see what happens when we punch up the CFG to 4.  Now we are telling the AI - do what you want, but do a little better at following my rules.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1f2v6nmwdoo91.png?width=3456&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c959d886a1afd9e475fcc77bd9208935610bd7b\n\nAgain, enlarge these images or generate these yourself if you want to really see what's happening, but here are a couple of my favorite results:\n\nThe \"young men\" all now look like young men, all still sticking with the theme for the most part - including in Seed 4, where the clothes and position of the man was completely dictated by the sand road in the seed!  It's a nice b&w portrait in Seed 3, which at this point tells me that if I'm looking for a vibrant color oil painting, I should avoid this seed completely - not only would you be fighting the b&w core of the theme, but this them obviously leans toward the photorealistic, unlike Seeds 2 or 4, which have a more painterly feel.\n\nI love what's happening with the anime at CFG 4.  Seed 2 has the same crazy purple hair going on, and the location of the sky and ground is consistent with the original seed image.  Following Seed 2 down to \"building\" I am completely fascinated by how the sky and ground maintained placement and the building is made of bricks with a purplish hue and vertical window bands mimicking the streaks in the original dress or wig.\n\nNotice how in the Seed 0 \"nature\" image, the road follows the position of the original table, and the sun and clouds are in the position of the bright window from the seed theme!\n\nFinally, for the prompt comparisons, CFG 8, which is a good default value for most things, and tells the AI to give your prompt the around the same weight as the seed theme:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dgfh4x9bhoo91.png?width=3456&format=png&auto=webp&s=81260d4aaaa7005296052bddd1ab5d4e9234cb9a\n\nNow THESE look like SD images.  Yet you can still *clearly* see the influence of the original seed theme even at this CFG setting.  It's not as obvious in every image anymore, but check out the general shapes, colors and lighting and compare them to the original.  Also, you begin to notice more subtle influences from the theme that go WAY beyond colors and shapes.  Do you notice how Seed 2 always puts people / anime in loose u-neck collars?  How the eye placement in Seed 0 stays the same and how it keeps the same zoom factor on the face?  You can use these to your advantage by doing a little research into seeds before starting your masterpiece.\n\nYou may be wondering - if I wanted a green \"nature\" scene and ended up with Seed 2, can I still force it to be green?  Yes, you can.  Sometimes with seeds it's easy and you just need to type in \"green nature\" or \"((green)) nature\".  Other times seeds fight you and you have to increase the CFG to make it listen.   And that raises another issue.  Do you notice how much more saturation and contrast these images have to the ones that were CFG 1 setting?  The reason the blank CFG 1 themes are so blurry and desaturated is because every level of CFG runs another layer multiplier of some amount.  That process increases the saturation and contrast.  Which is great for graphic comic bold line art with vibrant colors - crank that puppy up to 15!  But not so good for average images - especially any apocalyptic or dark futurism scenes (think Blade Runner) that need to be somewhat washed out and desaturated.\n\nAt the end of the day though, it’s much easier to generate a “man in a purple shirt” if purple is already a theme color.  It’s much harder to put a pool in your scene if there isn’t any blue in the theme.  And the more you force the prompt to take over, the more the AI will look to other objects in the image to imply a pool in ways you didn’t intend.\n\nLet's see an example of this, running the same seeds 0-5 at our three CFG values 1, 4 & 8, with the following prompt:\n\n* \"patio by a pool, table and chairs on the patio, at dusk\"\n\nNow I'm specifically using that exact wording because that's exactly what I think the theme for Seed 5 looks like, so I'm trying to stack the deck in its favor.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vk6twasbmoo91.png?width=3456&format=png&auto=webp&s=942b668990a8adbc2eb4119c8c57301ebaf16f0c\n\nAnd now we see that's exactly what happened.  Seed 5 maintained most of its original imagery, while the other seeds had to create the content where none necessarily existed.  They didn't do a bad job!  You could use any of them as a valid image, but if you were hoping to have a vantagepoint and a feel like the ones provided in Seeds 4 & 5, you're simple never going to get that from the other seeds.\n\nSeeds 1 and 4 had no idea what to do with the pool request in the CFG 1 images.  By CFG 4, they both gave up and stuck the pool somewhere.  Not bad and in fact they both successfully placed the pool well by CFG 8.  However if we wanted the pool in a specific location, starting with a seed that has blue in that location will result in an image more like the one we want.  (Notice how the house in Seed 2 still has a purple hue??)  And again, you CAN eliminate some of this by prompt engineering.  But that can be so tedious and sometimes you're just shouting at the wind.  Sometimes seeds simply won't behave.\n\nFinally, just to show you some of the images you can get as starter seeds, take a look at some of these (all 20-step images) that I got from random seeds with blank prompts...\n\nImagine wanting to end up with a portrait of a brown-haired woman.  Wouldn't it make it easier to start with seed 1003 or 1009?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tx9haxqsnoo91.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=176185a9fadf366dfe7d0f6d8ffe585d85488dd8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3jmzxmtnoo91.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ab1becaa7ddbea7fad7b0a7913ded7c4ab5820f\n\nNah, you say...

It’s easy to assume there’s a problem with weighting so you put tons of parentheses around the term, eventually ending up with a headache and a prompt that includes ((((vibrant colors)))) and the damn thing STILL doesn’t look good.  Sound familiar?\n\nWell now you have another tool to figure out how to fix it.\n\nANYWAY, I hope someone gets something out of all this typing.  I am not a writer and this took hours and hours and I have ZERO idea what inspired it.

This is only partially true. \n\nIt's entirely true. Computers can't \"be random\". They can spit out a string of numbers that, to humans, has no discernable, predictable pattern, but the computer is following a set of precise, deterministic instructions. The seed controls how that sequence is generated. For example, if I seed \"123\", I might ask the computer for five random numbers and get \"1, 7, 3, 4, 9\". If my friend Bob seeds it with \"123\" on his computer and asks for five numbers, he'll also get \"1, 7, 3, 4, 9\". The \"randomness\" is the fact that it gives us an unpredictable sequence of numbers instead of \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5\". However, the \"randomness\" is indeed entirely controlled by the seed that I give. Now imagine that instead of 5 numbers, I ask for enough numbers to fill an RGB image...\n\n> A seed is not a number, but an image. \n\nA seed is a number, but if you ask the computer to make you a random image made up of random pixels, then the image you receive will be entirely dependent on what seed you use immediately before asking for an image made up of random colors. If we use the same seed and then ask for the same width x height of random colors, we'll get exactly the same \"random\" image on our two different computers. In this way, the seed corresponds 1:1 with the starting image / noise that SD will start working with.\n\n> Or perhaps an image generated by a number. \n\nThis. It's exactly this.\n\n> This number is fixed in the SD ecosystem somehow by the model.ckpt file. \n\nNope, the seed number is turned into an image by determining the sequence of \"random\" numbers that will be used, and following a fixed procedure to turn random numbers into an image.\n\n> Ever wonder why that model file is so incredibly huge? This is why. \n\nNope, the model has nothing to do with the procedure to turn a seed into a starting image. The model is only used to iterate on the noise and make it progressively more like the prompt with every step.\n\n> Obviously the model.ckpt file cannot contain a quintillion images\n\nCorrect, it doesn't.\n\n> So either there’s a hell of a lot of repetition of themes among the seeds (I haven't come across any yet), \n\nEach seed value produces a unique starting noise image. The \"themes\" are just patterns you're perceiving, the computer nor SD have any perception of \"themes\" associated with starting noise.\n\n> or the model file contains explicit instructions for the computer on how to generate a theme image from a seed number in such a way that it will be identical to every other theme generated by the same number on any computer.\n\nThe computer is indeed following explicit instructions to generate the \"theme image\" from a seed number, but it is not dictated by the model. You've just described the nature of deterministic \"randomness\" that makes the above possible.\n\n### Comment ID ip0hgy1 with +6 score by [(kmullinax77, Reddit, 2022-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/xhsf8c/a_seed_tutorial/ip0hgy1/) (in reply to ID iozs8c2):\nFantastic.... thanks so much for the clarification - I'm updating that entire section with your information.\n\nMy only comment would be to say that while yes - \"the themes are just patterns you're perceiving, and the computer nor SD have any perception of themes associated with starting noise\" - they still exist.  If a theme is based on a purple hue... it's 100% accurate to say SD isn't aware of the theme or the purple or anything else we may see in it.  However, every generation taken from that seed will still use that image as a basis so will most likely carry the \"purple theme\" with it into future generated images - AND - I can count on every use of that seed in the future to contain the same purple theme.\n\nThe AI doesn't need to be aware of the theme for it to have an effect.\n\nI don't need the AI to be aware of it in order to use it to my advantage in image creation.\n\n### Comment ID iozze0p with +5 score by [(AnOnlineHandle, Reddit, 2022-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/xhsf8c/a_seed_tutorial/iozze0p/) (in reply to ID iozs8c2):\nGetting super technical, if somebody has added anything to the code which isn't using torch's random system then it won't be quite as (controllably) deterministic for them from then on (which is possible given all the various branches and scripts).\n\n#### Comment ID ip0i3wv with +2 score by [(Trakeen, Reddit, 2022-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/xhsf8c/a_seed_tutorial/ip0i3wv/) (in reply to ID iozze0p):\nDisco diffusion is a lot more random since the input seed is only used with some of the random number generators\n\n## Comment ID ip0engx with +8 score by [(Devalidating, Reddit, 2022-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/xhsf8c/a_seed_tutorial/ip0engx/) (in reply to ID xhsf8c):\nIt's more so due to the nature of diffusion models. They're essentially smart de-noising so it's forced to hallucinate the higher level more coherent aspects before the details and fine tuning that you see in later steps. The first couple steps are still pretty noisy so any detail information isn't meaningfully discernable from noise until later on. \n\nThe nature of breaking it up into \\~50 steps or so is that the image you feed into each step has a bigger effect on the output of it than the prompt/attention layers. When the computer generates a pseudorandom noise image from a formula using your seed, and feeds it into the first step, all the idiosyncrasies of that seed cascade down (the first step looks similar between prompts, which means the second does etc), meaning that different prompts can produce similar looking images with the same seed.\n\n## Comment ID iozmmko with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-09-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/xhsf8c/a_seed_tutorial/iozmmko/) (in reply to ID xhsf8c):\nWe are all learning here.

Moreover, if you want a specific composition/color profile, you can just draw some rough shapes in MS Paint and use it via img2img.\n\nEdit: adding a more detailed explaination.\n\nSD was trained to clean up \"noised\" images (images with random values added/subtracted to the pixels). SD generates new images by taking in a starting noise array that is randomly generated (seed determines what this randomly generated image will be) and \"de-noising\" it to fit the prompt.\n\nGenerating many \"seeds\" and picking one that you think gets you close to the image you want is a huge waste of time. Instead, you should rough out the kind of image you want in Paint and then use that as the input to img2img.\n\ntxt2img is just img2img with random noise used a the starting point.

You could imagine describing a whole game of AI vs AI chess as 1 seed number. Does it mean the number has any chess properties infused in it? No. It's more about the dumb code using the numbers.

I too notice how a seed seems to impose similar compositional elements over similar prompts, but I don't think it's because there is a sort of kantian noumena or underlying property/image to the seed. Rather I think what we are noticing is the interaction between the tokenized prompts, the model, and the seed number which provides noise. I think the word \"random\" isn't particularly helpful because seeds and the system are too complex to understand but purely deterministic. I think \"arbitrary\" is a better word for it since it makes noise that's consistent but not designed or predictable (by humans).\n\nI have run a lot of plot matrices like you have I think the seed characteristics you're noticing with blank prompts change unpredictability with your prompt. For example Ive been running timelines, so prompts of like \"a woman in 1980... 1990... 2000....\" Etc and as elements of the prompt changes it's clear that the denoising process (the model) changes things that appear to be coming from the seed (eg a block of red brown may be present in the seed for the eras of 1910-1960 but that block of red will slowly disappear as the prompt changes). Your experiments are interesting and I have had similar results, but I'm not convinced there is a fundamental quality to any seed, like seeds that make green landscapes with dark patches in one corner often end up morphing making portraits with dark centers and light corners depending on the prompts.\n\nEdit: spelling\n\n### Comment ID ip0kepj with +1 score by [(kmullinax77, Reddit, 2022-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/xhsf8c/a_seed_tutorial/ip0kepj/) (in reply to ID ip0jioh):\n>kaantian noumena\n\nI love this.\n\nThank you for your thoughtful response!\n\n#### Comment ID ip0nq59 with +1 score by [(Jcaquix, Reddit, 2022-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/xhsf8c/a_seed_tutorial/ip0nq59/) (in reply to ID ip0kepj):\nLol yeah sorry misspelling.

I think we need a seed library now, something like Lexica but just for empty prompts. And on the subject of image repositories that store seeds, this knowledge will be interesting to use when looking for a particular camera zoom and color style for instance.\n\nIf anyone is interested, here are the results using waifu diffusion model. Pretty cool to notice the differences and the similarities between both models.\n\n[CFG at 1](https://i.imgur.com/c0WAnBF.jpg)\n\n[CFG at 4](https://i.imgur.com/bPMP0cm.jpg)\n\n[CFG at 8](https://i.imgur.com/Kk1gQd7.jpg)\n\nI think danbooru's tags might be acting with too much strength on some of the prompts, particularly \"young man\" but it's nice to see the expected bias towards animation in raw output.\n\n### Comment ID ip0gnc7 with +2 score by [(kmullinax77, Reddit, 2022-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/xhsf8c/a_seed_tutorial/ip0gnc7/) (in reply to ID ip0forg):\nWOW what a great comment!  That is SO fascinating.\n\nThe Waifu difusion model absolutely and obviously skews artistic from your images, which is why it's so good with anime.

Just for curiosity I decided to [run it at 16 as well, here are the results](https://i.imgur.com/VZgZRdz.jpg), straying much further from default v1-4 model now...I don't even see where it is getting all of that stuff from but as you found out the base seed is still there.\n\nWith Automatic's gui you can use custom settings for your launcher to specify your models location, I have a few of them in a \"models\" folder and change them with a variable inside the bat file, you could also use arguments as well if you would prefer. This is my webui-user.bat\n\n    @echo off\n    \n    rem MODEL VARIABLES\n    set sd=sd-v1-4.ckpt\n    set wd=waifu_diffusion.ckpt\n    set t1=trinart2_step60000.ckpt\n    set t2=trinart2_step95000.ckpt\n    set t3=trinart2_step115000.ckpt\n    \n    set PYTHON=\n    set GIT=\n    set VENV_DIR=\n    set COMMANDLINE_ARGS=--medvram --opt-split-attention --ckpt models/%wd%\n    \n    call webui.bat    \nHopefully it's easy to understand what it does, but essentially you use --ckpt PATH_TO_MODEL on the COMMANDLINE_ARGS variable.\n\nWhen I want to change model I just use one of the variable names like sd, wd, t1, etc. I find it easier to manage this way.\n\nAlthough you do need to restart the server every time you change it in order for it to load at startup.\n\n## Comment ID iozwa8l with +1 score by [(GoldenRuleAlways, Reddit, 2022-09-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/xhsf8c/a_seed_tutorial/iozwa8l/) (in reply to ID xhsf8c):\nI’m a complete noob.

It can be a huge time save to simple use your prompt with as few as 4-7 steps to get a rough idea of how SD would then transform a seed-prompt pairing with 50 steps\n\nThis thereby allows discarding un-aesthetic seed-prompt pairings (again at low step count), and saving/diverting computation time to actually fine-tuning a promising seed-prompt with low steps into 50 steps + prompt tailoring.\n\nAlthough it can be annoying when adding additional words to the prompt also happens to mess with the pose/vantage point, but I can't really see a workaround for that other than to create the best prompt possible from the beginning.\n\n### Comment ID ip2gex5 with +2 score by [(kmullinax77, Reddit, 2022-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/xhsf8c/a_seed_tutorial/ip2gex5/) (in reply to ID ip0xi2i):\nI've noticed the same thing.

It makes sense that any non-uniformity or inclination in the initial noise will show up in the result because the algorithm has nothing else to go on so the properties of the initial starting noise dominate the result.\n\nIf you gave it a prompt with numerous keywords it'd be looking to \"recognize\" those numerous things in the noise rather than just 'playing with its food' of the initial noise.\n\nWhen I started running SD on my computer last week, one of the first things I thought to run was something like \"sea otter monster attacking a coastal city\" and so I got pics of large sea otter monsters emerging from oceans. Then I did \"sea otter octopus monster attacking a coastal city\" with the same seed and the composition of the images and the otters themselves were nearly the same, the otter just had tentacles below it, which made me think that the initial noise/seed was providing light and dark regions that were steering the algorithm to position the same or similar elements, or 'recognize' them, in different ways depending on how the light and dark blobs were arranged.\n\n## Comment ID ip8q9yz with +1 score by [(BrockVelocity, Reddit, 2022-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/xhsf8c/a_seed_tutorial/ip8q9yz/) (in reply to ID xhsf8c):\nThis is incredibly helpful and insightful - thanks so much for taking the time to type all of this up!\n\n## Comment ID j1q1xfc with +1 score by [(DrakenZA, Reddit, 2022-12-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/xhsf8c/a_seed_tutorial/j1q1xfc/) (in reply to ID xhsf8c):\nIf you are that worried about the initial noise  generated by the image, you can simply always do img2img, where you are providing the 'starting point' instead of it just being random torch noise.\n\n## Comment ID jcbi2le with +1 score by [(mikebrave, Reddit, 2023-03-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/xhsf8c/a_seed_tutorial/jcbi2le/) (in reply to ID xhsf8c):\nThanks for this, the core idea of matching a similar seed to what you want is sound. \n\nReminds me about hearing how they did the maps in star wars galaxies, basically used noise (similar to what our seeds do), then they cherry picked the ones that looked close to what they wanted the landscape to look like, then used a tool to layer important features on top of it. This made their map data miniscule since it only needed to save the original seed and the important details layered on top, which allowed them to have way more land in a video game than any other at the time.\n\n## Comment ID jzrgu1h with +1 score by [(dirtydevotee, Reddit, 2023-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/xhsf8c/a_seed_tutorial/jzrgu1h/) (in reply to ID xhsf8c):\nWell done! It is my opinion based on some early testing that seed knowledge can be quite valuable. For several days now, I've been accumulating renders based on the prompt \",\" and found that little things like the orientation of streets and the existence of columns reoccur in 90% of images created by said seed. If a hypothetical \"Seed X\" does rings, you will notice rings in many \"Seed X\" renders. If in the future you need a shot with a ring (or pipe/gun barrel/test tube) in it, knowing \"Seed X\" has such a proclivity means you can get the shot you want with minimal work in the prompt.  \n\n\nAs of today, it's a work in progress. But just in case I'm right, finding useful seeds could be a shortcut in your workflow."

Leadership at all levels should embody the qualities that attract and retain top talent.\n\t•\tEnsure that hiring managers are well-versed in company culture and values. Leaders need to not only understand these principles but also actively model and communicate them.\n\t•\tFoster a culture where employees and candidates feel heard, respected, and valued—this starts with clear communication, mutual respect, and accountability.\n\t•\tCreate structures to encourage and embrace innovation, ensuring employees feel comfortable sharing new ideas without fear of them being dismissed.\n\nFinal Thought:\nSquare and Block have immense potential to lead by example in the fintech industry, and their mission is worth believing in. With its strong foundation, Square has the opportunity to not only excel in financial technology but also set the standard for inclusive, value-driven workplaces. With stronger alignment in leadership, a renewed focus on respect and innovation, and hiring managers who embody these principles, the company could create an even more impactful and inspiring environment for its teams and candidates.",

This lack of openness diminished trust in the process.\n\t•\tInnovation: Suggestions for thinking outside the box during a role-play exercise were dismissed outright, which seemed contradictory to Block’s emphasis on creativity.\n\t•\tKnowledge Gaps: One of the interviewers did not know how to answer when asked how they foster a positive company culture. This is a red flag, as fostering culture is fundamental to a company’s leadership and values.",

They have a goal to \"go upmarket\" but our product can barely handle a $10 million seller on it's own. Anything more than that, we need a partner to come in to save the day because we can't do our job\n3. Leadership within the org is a \"boys\" club. They all started around the same time and climbed their way to the top. Now, no one is held accountable because they all protect each other. There should have been some significant changes to certain leadership teams (BDR leaders for example) a while ago but instead they shifted the blame to our US Head of Sales and let them go. \n4. Speaking of BDR, they continue to over hire and underdeliver. They think the answer to their problem is to keep hiring people and firing them when they don't hit quota after 3 months. Apparently the org has a goal of closing a certain amount of GPV and we're extremely behind. So instead of focusing on the current reps, they think the easy way out is to keep hiring to get closer to that number.\n5. The product has become incredibly hard to sell. I'm not sure if it's because we are in an election year but this has been the worst year for Square sales.\n6. Leadership continues to say that they are listening to feedback yet it feels like it goes through one ear and comes out the other.",

You still have people who won’t give feedback, are not great at communication, and don’t fully see the value of their assistant. Block did one of the best jobs of managing this, and for the majority of the time we were seen as a significant part of company.\n\nUnfortunately, the head of the EO team has never been an EA herself and relies on the information given to her by her direct leads. These leads were like toxic high school students, they fought with each other, they use their own directs against each other, they blocked promotions, they over shared information that they should not have shared, and there was even an instance where one of them tried to get the other one fired for sharing privy information that she herself had shared with many people. Favoritism, bullying, and promoting people that didn’t deserve to get promoted were all prevalent. It made it very hard to work in collaboration across BUs and so much time and energy was wasted on petty drama. There was zero management training for most managers, and many were not good at feedback or managing their own emotions which spilled out into their directs. \n\nWith the RIF the EO team was gutted, and the change to titles and scope was unreal. There was so much upset but the leads refused feedback, and we were told in a meeting that we had “a choice to work here, so get over it”. The management team left are either in shock, or not very good but they are there through favoritism. Some of the managers who are still there are either compliant to the toxic approach and gossip, or on one lead’s good side, and are too scared to go against her. The few promotions we saw were friends with her and it was so obvious what was going on.\n\n I loved this job, or I thought I did, until this year when the toxicity got to be too much, and it’s so deep in leadership.",

My first year or so, I couldn't imagine ever working anywhere else, but the it all went south. Massive and quick hiring, endless budget, and uncontrolled product offering/strategy spread led to lots of chaos, exec favoritism/cliques, org silos, product non-interoperability, territory grabs and inexperienced and unsupported management promotions causing a lot of unnecessary conflict and drama. There is a lot of change still settling there. It could turn out well now that there seems to be a bit more intentional corporate structure, but if you are interested in working there, really interview your hiring manager critically. I still believe strongly in the core product offering and wish them success, but it came with A LOT of extra headaches that were not worth it for me. I love solving hard product problems, but when you don't have the support of the organization and your own management to actually achieve that, it was time for me to go.",

The true test of character (for both people and companies) is when things get difficult.\n\nBlock talks a big game about economic empowerment and valuing its people. But their 2023 layoffs demonstrate that their rhetoric has become threadbare. When they are done with you they don’t hesitate to discard you with little to show for it. \n\nLayoffs are a fact of life. But decent companies treat their people decently, even when those people are on the way out. \n\nYes, the odds of you getting laid off are slim. But Block’s recent stingy exit packages are not consistent with their past. It is indicative of a cultural shift away from valuing people.\n\nHere is a table of the relative size of exit packages compared to the company’s size (a measure of the depth of their finances). The data are normalized so Block = 100%.\n\nBlock, Market cap = 100%, Exit package = 100% \nStripe, Market cap =125%, Exit package = 375% \nDoorDash, Market cap = 63%, Exit package = 288%\nPlaid, Market cap = 34%, Exit package = 325%\nLyft, Market cap = 10%, Exit package = 325%\nCoursera, Market cap = 5%, Exit package = 341%\n\n“Exit package” includes the notification period (period where you are no longer working but still on the payroll), any stock vested or bonus paid after notification of layoff, and severance.\n\nNaturally, Block’s package also pales in comparison to those of larger companies. Salesforce's severance was 6x Block's, Alphabet's was more than 4x, and Meta's was 3.5x Block's exit package.",

After the team favorites were promoted the promo rules magically changed. Now you need a \"business need\" for your promotion so you're essentially stuck in your level unless you switch roles or your exec is promoted; I supported some of the worst execs in my EA career at Block, Inc. which is crazy because Block has great people but some of the senior leaders (across the company) aren't so great and are instead super problematic with poor internal reputations. Before the layoffs, politics in the EO department was insane. Some leads give a lot of lip service and will act like they support you and are \"there\" for you but actually aren't.

Speaking of BDR, they continue to over hire and underdeliver. They think the answer to their problem is to keep hiring people and firing them when they don't hit quota after 3 months. Apparently the org has a goal of closing a certain amount of GPV and we're extremely behind. So instead of focusing on the current reps, they think the easy way out is to keep hiring to get closer to that number.\n5. The product has become incredibly hard to sell.

Favoritism, bullying, and promoting people that didn’t deserve to get promoted were all prevalent. It made it very hard to work in collaboration across BUs and so much time and energy was wasted on petty drama. There was zero management training for most managers, and many were not good at feedback or managing their own emotions which spilled out into their directs. \n\nWith the RIF the EO team was gutted, and the change to titles and scope was unreal.

Leadership at all levels should embody the qualities that attract and retain top talent.\n\t•\tEnsure that hiring managers are well-versed in company culture and values. Leaders need to not only understand these principles but also actively model and communicate them.\n\t•\tFoster a culture where employees and candidates feel heard, respected, and valued—this starts with clear communication, mutual respect, and accountability.\n\t•\tCreate structures to encourage and embrace innovation, ensuring employees feel comfortable sharing new ideas without fear of them being dismissed.\n\nFinal Thought:\nSquare and Block have immense potential to lead by example in the fintech industry, and their mission is worth believing in. With its strong foundation, Square has the opportunity to not only excel in financial technology but also set the standard for inclusive, value-driven workplaces. With stronger alignment in leadership, a renewed focus on respect and innovation, and hiring managers who embody these principles, the company could create an even more impactful and inspiring environment for its teams and candidates.",

This lack of openness diminished trust in the process.\n\t•\tInnovation: Suggestions for thinking outside the box during a role-play exercise were dismissed outright, which seemed contradictory to Block’s emphasis on creativity.\n\t•\tKnowledge Gaps: One of the interviewers did not know how to answer when asked how they foster a positive company culture. This is a red flag, as fostering culture is fundamental to a company’s leadership and values.",

My experience with them was detailed, thorough, and professional, setting a high standard for candidate engagement.\n\t•\tSquare has created groundbreaking products that genuinely help businesses thrive. Being part of a company that prioritizes empowerment and accessibility is inspiring.\n\t•\tDuring the interview process, I encountered a leader who truly embodied the values of empathy, inclusion, and innovation.

      "# [Block, Inc. by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2010-05-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.)\nAmerican financial services company\n\n\"Square, Inc.\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Square (video game company).\n\nBlock, Inc. (formerly Square, Inc.[10]) is an American technology company offering financial services to consumers and sellers.[11][12][13] Founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey, it is the U.S. market leader in point-of-sale systems.[14][15][16] As of 2023, Block serves 56 million users and 4 million sellers,[17][18] processing $228 billion in payments annually.[4]\n\nBlock's inaugural product Square, launched in 2009, is a point-of-sale system.[14] It allows businesses to accept card payments and manage operations, including bookings,[19] e-Commerce,[20] inventory,[21] payroll, shift scheduling,[22] banking, and obtaining business loans.[23] Additionally, Block's portfolio includes Cash App, a consumer-focused digital wallet introduced in 2013.[12][24] The wallet allows users to send, receive or save money,[25][26] access a debit card, invest in stocks and bitcoin,[27][28] apply for personal loans,[29] and file taxes.[30] Block also owns Afterpay, a buy now, pay later service;[31] Bitkey, a self-custody bitcoin wallet;[32][33] a bitcoin mining hardware business;[34][35] and Tidal, a music streaming service.[36]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n2009: Conception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original inspiration for Block's first product \"Square\" occurred to Jack Dorsey in 2009 when his friend Jim McKelvey was unable to complete a $2,000 sale of his glass faucets and fittings because he could not accept credit cards.[37] Co-founders Dorsey—who also co-founded Twitter—and McKelvey began developing the company out of a small office in St. Louis.[38] The name \"Square\" derives from the company's square-shaped card reader product.[39][40]\n\n2010–2014: Early years\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to Forbes, Block, named Square, Inc. then, tested its payment method on 50,000 merchants in the summer of 2010, and was reporting a chargeback rate of less than 0.05 percent.[41] In February 2011, Square was reportedly valued at approximately US$240 million, signing up 100,000 new merchants every month.[42] In April 2011, Square announced that it has secured an investment from Visa.[43] In October 2011, the company stated that it was processing about US$2 billion per year in payments through its \"Square\" card readers, charging 2.75 percent per swipe.[44]\n\nIn 2012, Starbucks and Square announced a partnership that would allow Starbucks to use the Square payment technology to accept payments for coffee. In the same year, Starbucks also reportedly invested in Square at a valuation of US$25 million.[45] Square was handling an annual payment volume of around US$6 billion around that time.[46]\n\nIn 2013, Square launched Cash App, a peer to peer payment service.[26] In October 2014, the company launched the integration of a payroll feature into its Square payment processing system, following the integrations of a merchant cash advance offering, a customer feedback product and an invoicing service into the system.[47]\n\n2015–2020: Initial public offering, growth\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, Square stated that it processed about US$23.8 billion worth of payment volume in 2014.[48] In the same year, the company sold shares in its initial public offering for US$9 per share, giving itself a market capitalization of $2.9 billion.[49]\n\nIn 2018, Vox reported Square as stating that over 7 million people used the Cash App in December 2017. Vox also stated that Cash App was the \"No. 1 free finance app\" in Apple's U.S. iPhone App Store and was \"ahead\" of PayPal and Venmo.[24]\n\nIn October 2020, Square put approximately 1% of their total assets ($50 million) in Bitcoin (4,709 bitcoins), citing Bitcoin's \"potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future\" as their main reasoning.[50] The company purchased approximately 3,318 bitcoins in February 2021 for a cost of around $170 million, bringing Square's total holdings to around 8,027 bitcoins (equivalent to around US$500 million in 2021, around US$481 million as of July 2024).[51]\n\n2021–present: Name change, acquisitions\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 2, 2021, Square reached an agreement to acquire majority ownership in Tidal. Square paid $297 million in cash and stock for Tidal, with Jay-Z joining the company's board of directors. Jay-Z, as well as other artists who currently own stock in Tidal, will remain stakeholders.[52][53][54]\n\nOn December 1, 2021, Square announced that it would change its company name to Block, Inc. on December 10.[55][56] The change was announced shortly after Dorsey resigned as CEO of Twitter.[57] On December 10, 2021, the name change took effect, and Square, Inc. became Block, Inc.[58] On December 16, less than a week into the rebrand, H&R Block, sued the company for trademark infringement, claiming that the name seeks to confuse customers by misappropriating the Block brand name, which H&R owns.[59] The lawsuit was resolved in April 2023 when the two companies jointly agreed to dismiss the suit.[60]\n\nOn January 31, 2022, Block completed its acquisition of Afterpay, an Australian buy now, pay later (BNPL) lender.[61]\n\nOn September 7 and 8, 2023, Block's Square and Cash App experienced outages, affecting thousands of users. Card payment processing, peer-to-peer payments and other transactions were among the impacted operations. On September 8, 2023, Block informed that the service disruptions had been resolved and all systems were operational by the afternoon of that day. It also said the outage was caused by an issue with the company's Domain Name System (DNS), and did not stem from a cyberattack.[62][63] In the following week, Block apologized to its customers and acknowledged “this situation was made more difficult by our communication”. To reduce the risk of a similar outage in future, the company said it had deployed a new set of firewall and DNS server changes, expanded offline payment capabilities so merchants can still accept payments in offline mode, and put in place additional measures.[64] Later in the month, Block said in a regulatory filing that the CEO of its Square business, Alyssa Henry, was set to leave the company in October 2023, and that Jack Dorsey, serving then as the \"Block Head\" and Chairperson, would take on an additional role of \"Square Head\".[65]\n\nIn February 2024, Block reported an annual \"Gross Payment Volume\" of US$228 billion and an annual income of $9.8 million for the year 2023.[4] In April 2024, CNBC reported that Block announced it had finished the development of its own standalone three-nanometer bitcoin mining chip and was in the process of working through the design with a semiconductor foundry. The company was also reported to be developing a \"full bitcoin mining system\", stating that its goal was to both decentralize the supply of bitcoin mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate — a proxy for industry competition and mining difficulty. In this regard, according to CNBC, Block was solving a \"major barrier to entry\" posed by the relative difficulty in sourcing mining rigs, their high prices and unpredictable delivery.[35] In May 2024, the company's Square platform was found to be the market leader in point-of-sale systems in the U.S.[16][15] In July 2024, Block signed a \"large-scale crypto mining hardware pact\", agreeing to supply its chips to bitcoin miner \"Core Scientific\". The company did not disclose financial details of the pact.[34][66] In October 2024, Bitkey appeared in TIME's list of the \"best inventions of 2024\".[67][68] In November 2024, Fortune reported that Block was laying off many employees from its Tidal, TBD and Square services.[69] That same month, Block announced it was \"winding down\" TBD, \"scaling back\" investments in Tidal and focussing its resources on its bitcoin mining initiative as well as Bitkey, while adding that it was \"refining\" its investments based on progress.[70][71]\n\nSubsidiaries, products, services\n\n[edit]\n\nSquare\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Square (payment system)\n\nSquare is a payments platform that allows businesses to accept card payments and use smartphones or tablets or computers as payment registers for a point-of-sale system (POS).[72][14][73] The platform was founded in 2009 by Dorsey and McKelvey. Square also offers additional features to manage various operations including staff payroll and shift schedules,[22] customer bookings,[19][74] inventory,[21] e-Commerce,[20][75][76] banking and business loans.[23]\n\nIn 2022, a Protocol survey showed that 35% of U.S. small business owners used Square, a higher percentage than its competitors, while also highlighting the POS market's continued fragmentation.[77] In April 2023, Square was reported to have 4 million merchants as its customers.[78][17] Its client base includes small and medium-sized businesses as well as larger ones.[79][13][80] As of 2024, the platform is available in the U.S., Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Republic of Ireland, Spain and the U.K.[81]\n\nCash App\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Cash App\n\nLaunched in October 2013, Cash App (formerly Square Cash) is a digital wallet which allows sending and receiving money, investing in stocks or bitcoin, and filing taxes.[12][25][26] In March 2015, the firm introduced Square Cash for businesses, which includes the ability for individuals, organizations, and business owners to use a unique username, known as a $cashtag, to send and receive money.[82] As of 2023, Cash App also offers a savings account and a debit card, and services such as direct deposit and investing in stocks and Bitcoin.[27][28] In March 2023, USA Today reported that Cash App offered a free tax-filing service while cautioning that it didn't accommodate \"every tax situation\" and didn't offer \"live tax support\".[30] In October 2023, it was reported that Cash App also allowed users to borrow up to $200 from the app, and that \"not everyone is an eligible user for this feature\".[29]\n\nIn February 2024, Block reported 56 million \"monthly active users\" for Cash App.[18]\n\nAfterpay\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Afterpay\n\nAfterpay is an Australian digital payment platform in which a bought product can be paid off in four installments. This idea made in 2008 by a then eighteen-year-old Nick Molnar was geared towards millennials and inspired by the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Molnar and Partner/ Co-founder Anthony Eisen launched their platform in 2014 and in four years their product reached a market capitalization of around $3.3 billion. In February 2020, Afterpay was reported to have 3.6 million active customers in the US, 3.1 million in Australia and New Zealand, and 600,000 in the UK. According to ABC News (Australia) in August 2021, Afterpay had operations in the U.S., Canada and New Zealand, as well as in the U.K., France, Italy and Spain as Clearpay.[83] In the same month, Afterpay and Block announced that Afterpay would be acquired by Block.[84] Block paid US$29 billion in stock for the acquisition and the process was finalized in January 2022. Molnar and Eisen continued to lead Afterpay's merchant and consumer businesses following the acquisition.[61][31]\n\nAs of 2023, Afterpay serves 24 million users and 348,000 merchants,[85][86] processing US$27.3 billion in payments annually.[87] It also ranks among the three most-used BNPL services globally.[88]\n\nBitkey\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Bitkey\n\nIn December 2023, Block launched Bitkey, a self-custody Bitcoin hardware wallet, in 95 countries including the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Nigeria, Argentina, Mexico, and India. The wallet allows investors to own, manage and store their Bitcoin without relying on third-party exchanges or custodians. Bitkey includes a mobile app, hardware device, and a set of recovery tools in case the customer loses the phone, their hardware or both. The wallet cannot access or move a customer's Bitcoin without them.[32][33][89] In October 2024, TIME named Bitkey as one of the \"best inventions of 2024\".[67][68]\n\nBitcoin mining system\n\n[edit]\n\nIn April 2024, Block announced it had finished developing its own standalone three-nanometer bitcoin mining chip and was working through the design with a semiconductor foundry. The company reportedly aimed at building a \"full bitcoin mining system\", stating that its goal was to decentralize both the supply of bitcoin mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate.[35] In July 2024, Block signed an agreement to supply its chips to bitcoin miner \"Core Scientific\".[34][66]\n\nTidal\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Tidal (service)\n\nTidal is a high-definition music streaming service with a catalog of over 100 million songs across various genres. It offers both a subscription plan and an ad-supported free plan.[90][91] Originally launched in 2014 by Aspiro, a Norwegian company, Tidal was purchased in 2015 by American rapper Jay-Z for $56 million, reportedly to \"give artists more control over the distribution of their music\".[92][93] At that time, Tidal was available in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Republic of Ireland, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.[90] In 2021, Block took majority ownership of Tidal for $297 million,[36] stating it aimed to find \"new ways for artists to support their work\" and to create \"tools that can help support musicians' businesses\".[94][93] Tidal was then operating in a streaming market dominated by Spotify and others, and was paying \"better royalty rates\" to artists than its rivals including Spotify.[95][94] In May 2023, Wired reported that Tidal's “Direct Artist Payouts” scheme, in which up to 10 percent of a user's subscription fee was delivered to the artists they listened to most, had been discontinued in 2022. According to Wired, the scheme was \"thoughtful\" and supportive of bands and artists, and its closure reduced some of Tidal's market differentiation.[91] In November 2024, Block announced it was \"scaling back\" investments in Tidal after reports emerged that the company was laying off Tidal employees.[70][71][69][96] Block added that it was eliminating Tidal's product management and product marketing functions entirely and that Tidal would become a smaller entity, focusing on fewer areas with a more sustained approach to product development.[96]\n\nFinancials\n\n[edit]\n\nSquare received angel investments from Marissa Mayer, Kevin Rose, Biz Stone, Dennis Crowley, Shawn Fanning, MC Hammer, and Esther Dyson.[citation needed] Since then, it has raised several additional rounds of funding:\n\nSeries A funding from Khosla Ventures[97]\n\nSeries B funding from Sequoia Capital[97]\n\nSeries C funding from Kleiner Perkins[97]\n\nSeries D funding from Citi Ventures, Rizvi Traverse Management, and Starbucks[98]\n\nSeries E funding from Goldman Sachs, Rizvi Traverse Management, and GIC Private Limited[99]\n\nThe company's valuation in October 2014 was $6 billion.[100] On November 19, 2015, Square had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial valuation of $2.9 billion, down by more than half from its last valuation in October 2014 at $6 billion. The series E funding shares had different rights than the common shares sold at the IPO, therefore the $6 billion 'valuation' from October 2014 is wrong. Although the firm was yet to make a profit as of 2015 and had lost $420 million since 2012, it had decreased its losses from 44% of revenues to 16% in the six months leading up to its IPO.[101] For the fiscal year 2018, Square reported losses of US$38 million, with an annual revenue of US$3.299 billion, an increase of 49.0% over the previous fiscal cycle.\n\nYear[102] Revenue\n\nin mil.

In May 2020, Square announced that some of its workers would be allowed to be permanent remote workers.[108] As of 2021, although Block's real estate footprint remains intact, they no longer have a designated headquarters location.[2]\n\nFinancing and acquisitions\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2014, Victory Park Capital, an asset management firm, invested in Square Capital.[109] In May 2015, Square Capital raised additional funding, with Victory Park Capital tripling its initial investment.[110] As of 2016, Square had loaned $1 billion to companies through Square Capital since the program's inception.[111] On November 19, 2015, Square Inc. became a public company via an initial public offering.[112][113] On April 19, 2018, Square announced that it had acquired Zesty, a food delivery service that caters to corporate offices.[114][115] On April 26, 2018, Square announced that it would acquire Weebly, a website-building service, for $365 million.[116] In May 2019, Square announced that it had acquired Eloquent Labs, an artificial intelligence startup helping improve the customer service experience.[117]\n\nIn February 2020, Square announced that it had acquired Dessa, a Toronto-based deep learning company.[118] In November 2020, Square announced it was acquiring Credit Karma Tax, a free do-it-yourself tax-filing service, from Credit Karma for $50 million and would make it a part of its Cash App unit.[119] In March 2021, Square announced it was acquiring a significant majority in music streaming platform Tidal for $293 million in a deal of stock and cash.[120] In the same month, Square's Q1 sales surged 266% as transactions jumped amid economic recovery.[121] In August 2021, Square announced its acquisition of Afterpay, a company offering a \"buy now, pay later\" service. Square finalized the $29 billion stock deal on January 31, 2022.[122][61]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nAllegations of illegal activity\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 23, 2023, investment research firm Hindenburg Research disclosed a short position in Block, leading to a 15% drop in the company's shares that day. Hindenburg's accusations of Block included exaggerating user counts, failing to curb fraud and illegal activity on Cash App, and permitting impersonation of high-profile individuals. It also wrote in its report that Block \"embraced predatory offerings and compliance worst practices in order to fuel growth and profit from facilitation of fraud against consumers and the government.\"[123][124]\n\nBlock responded to the allegations in a press release saying, \"We intend to work with the SEC and explore legal action against Hindenburg Research for the factually inaccurate and misleading report they shared about our Cash App business today\".[125]\n\nNBC News reported in May 2024 that prosecutors at the Southern District of New York were examining financial transactions and internal practices at Block, stemming from alleged compliance lapses at its Square and Cash App units. According to the report, the company allegedly failed to collect adequate information from customers, processed transactions involving countries subject to economic sanctions, and processed cryptocurrency transactions for terrorist groups.[126] In November 2024, Block disclosed in its earnings report for July-September 2024 that it was negotiating a potential settlement with several state regulators that had probed the company's anti-money laundering program. Additionally, Block stated it was negotiating a potential settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in matters including those related to Cash App’s handling of customer complaints and disputes. The company added it had accrued a liability for estimated amount in connection with each potential settlement and the amount was not material to the company's financial statements as of September 30, 2024.[127][128]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",

Under those laws, a business is the company that decides why and how to process personal information. A service provider processes personal information on behalf of a business in order to provide services. When Square processes Your Customers’ Data, we generally act as your service provider. In select cases, however, we may act as a business when we process Your Customers’ Data. For example, we act as a business when we use Your Customers’ Data to send your customers digital receipts directly from Square, or when we allow you to use Customer Directory or Square Marketing to contact your buyer using a masked email address (for example, j*****@gmail.com) that gets routed to them via Square. Your customers can visit the Privacy Notice for Square Buyer Features for more information on how Square processes their data when it is acting as a business.\n\nEven though you use our services while acting as an employee, owner, director, officer, or contractor of a company, partnership, sole proprietor of a business, nonprofit, or government agency, if you live in California, California law gives you the right to ask if we disclose your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes (we do not disclose your personal information for others’ direct marketing purposes).\n\nPlease see CCPA Privacy Requests Metrics for details on the number of Access, Deletion, and Do Not Share My Information requests that we received and processed in the last year.\n\nCHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY NOTICE\n\nWe reserve the right to change this Privacy Notice from time to time, as may be required.

If you disagree with these changes, you may cancel your account at any time.

Formerly known as Square, the company develops hardware and software to help business operations, including point-of-sale hardware, payments processing and analytics software, a business debit card called Square Card, and a peer-to-peer payment service called Cash App.\n\nThe company's top individual shareholders are Jack Dorsey, Alyssa Henry, and Roelof Botha.

Each of these forms provides a way for investors to track significant positions made by major investors.\n\nThe following figures are as of the company's proxy statement from April 2023 unless otherwise indicated.\n\nJack Dorsey\n\nJack Dorsey owns one million shares of Class A Block stock, representing about 0.2% of the total shares outstanding. He also owns about 47.85 million of the company's Class B stock or roughly 79% of the outstanding shares.\n\nDorsey, whose net worth as of February 2024 was approximately $4.9 billion, co-founded social networking company X (formerly Twitter) in 2006, before selling the company to Elon Musk in 2022 for $43 billion.

He is a partner at Sequoia Capital and was chief financial officer (CFO) at PayPal.\n\nTop 3 Institutional Shareholders\n\nInstitutional investors hold the majority of Block shares. Keep in mind that institutional doesn't necessarily mean a financial institution. The term refers to the type of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings used to track major investments.\n\nVanguard Group\n\nVanguard Group owns 35.51 million shares of Block representing 6.5% of shares outstanding of the company's Class A stock. The company is primarily a mutual fund and ETF management company with about $7.2 trillion in global assets under management (AUM).\n\nBlackRock\n\nBlackRock (BLK) owns 32.92 million shares of Block as of February 2024, which represents 5.36% of the total shares outstanding.
