      "# [Partner Profiles: Hannah Brennan â Scarf by Block on 2024-08-15](https://block.xyz/inside/scarfcommunityinterview)\nPartner Profiles is an interview series that spotlights Blockâs community partners â both organizations and individuals â and the work they do to increase access to the economy.\n\nIn this installment of the series, we talk with Hannah Brennan, cofounder and CEO of Scarf, a community organization offering hospitality job training to young refugees and migrants in Australia.\n\nBack in 2010, Hannah Brennan and Jess Moran â two friends and coworkers in Melbourneâs hospitality industry â began working to reduce barriers preventing young refugees and migrants from gaining employment in Australia. While there were jobs to be filled, especially in the hospitality and service industries, roadblocks like hiring discrimination, limited knowledge of employment pathways, and lack of local experience and references kept many in the refugee community from landing work in their new home country. Frustrated by the disconnect, Hannah and Jess launched Scarf â a crash course, of sorts, designed to help newly arrived young people navigate and succeed in Australiaâs hospitality industry.\n\nIn the nearly 14 years since, Scarf has supported close to 350 young people in their journey to gain knowledge, skills, confidence, and networks. Theyâve accomplished this through hands-on hospitality training, mentoring, and paid work experience programs. Scarf graduates become part of a supportive new community â and around three-quarters of them land jobs within six months.\n\nFor this interview we talked with Hannah, Scarfâs cofounder and current CEO, to learn more about Scarfâs history, who the program helps, and how inclusive training and mentoring can break down barriers to the economy.\n\nIn your words, what is Scarfâs mission?\n\nWe exist to create a safe and supportive space for young people seeking asylum, and those from refugee and migrant backgrounds, to learn, make mistakes, be mentored, and begin their working lives in Australia. A big aim for us is to make the [hospitality] industry more equitable and accessible to potential employees. And, ideally, not just the cohorts we work with directly, but more broadly for all young people from migrant, refugee, and asylum-seeking backgrounds so that they're not locked out of jobs.\n\nHow did Scarf start?\n\nIt started just over 14 years ago. I was in my mid-twenties at the time. Iâd been working in hospitality for a few years, and I met Scarfâs other cofounder, Jess Moran, when we were working at a restaurant together. We both had a bit of an interest in giving back to the community and we started doing some volunteer work and meeting with young people from refugee backgrounds. And we found that we were hearing this really similar story: these young people wanted to be working, but no one would give them a shot. They couldnât get an interview.\n\nSo [Jess and I] felt this growing frustration, because we loved the hospitality industry â for us, people born in Australia with some experience working at a cafe or restaurant, it often felt like a very supportive and accessible space. But we were meeting these great people who wanted work but just couldnât get a job. Meanwhile, Jess and I were working at an events space that was desperate for staff. There was this disconnect.\n\nI look back now and think, we were so young and naive. We really didnât grasp how huge these barriers to work were for these young people. We came at it with this sort of simplistic lens of, âThere's a job here, thereâs a person here, but the person is locked out of it. That's not fair and we want to change that.â\n\nDid you and Jess have much experience in community development at that point?\n\nWe didnât. But I think thatâs one of the strengths of Scarf, that there was a lot we didnât know and we were really hopeful that we could change the status quo. And I speak for myself now â Jess will always be a cofounder of Scarf, but she stepped out of the organization in about the third year and moved on to study and other work in the community sector â Iâm still learning. Iâm still figuring out what good community development looks like, and I donât call myself a professional in that sense. Iâm a hospitality professional. But there are a lot of amazing and experienced people who have really helped the program develop over the years and get better and better.\n\nThese days the program is run by a small but mighty team of professionals who are smart, creative, and experienced, but we still welcome input from mentors, supervisors, board members, and beyond. And we have input from Graduate Voice, a group which is made up of young people whoâve gone through our program, and who advise us on how to make Scarf as practical, culturally safe, and valuable as possible for future trainees.\n\nCan you walk me through how the Scarf program works for participants?\n\nWe ran our pilot program back in 2010 with eight trainees. And basically, neither Jess or I have an education background. But we know hospitality. So we thought, okay, what are the key things someone would need to know to be able to walk into a cafe or restaurant and hit the ground running? We realized the training didnât need to be in depth â trainees didnât need to be experts on wine or coffee, but they did need to know how to properly pour a glass of wine and make a decent espresso coffee. So we basically just came up with a program and said, okay, weâll meet once a week and train for a few hours. And at the end of each weekly training session, we ran a dinner service in a friendâs restaurant that was closed â a lot of the customers were friends and family, and we had some donated stock from a friend who worked at a wine company or a local coffee roaster. Some of our really good friends that weâd made in hospitality came on board as mentors â pairing a trainee with a mentor has always been key in the program. The mentor is someone whoâs worked in hospitality for at least five years. Theyâre passionate about it and ready to share their skills to really help build a young personâs confidence just through walking alongside them as they train and as they serve real customers, which can be quite intimidating in the beginning. One of our graduates once described their mentor as âa friendly shadow.â\n\nThat pilot program was by no means perfect. Weâve done a lot of evaluation work and the program has evolved so much since then, and I think it just gets better every year. Weâre constantly asking trainees for feedback and gathering evidence of whatâs working well, what could be better. And I think thatâs another strength. Weâre like, the program is good, better than good, but it could always be better.\n\nHow does Square play into your training?\n\nWhen we go to a partner venue to run a Scarf event, we need to set up our own mini restaurant within that space. And we want to make the simulation as realistic as possible for the trainees. So the trainees learn how to use Square tools, and then during our events they actually use the products during service to input orders and take payments from diners. Itâs important that our graduates come out of the program knowing how to use the technology they are going to be working with in future hospitality jobs.\n\nWhat was Scarfâs initial purpose, and how did it evolve?\n\nIn the early days it was very much about training and jobs. We didnât really understand the part we played in creating a safe space for people who were new to Australia, who often had things going on in their lives that you canât see just by looking at them. Things that created almost insurmountable barriers to employment.\n\nWe have incredible trainers and mentors and we have a really specific way of inducting people, working within a trauma-informed framework, and making sure the program is a very welcoming space. As much as Scarf is about hospitality and learning and work, I would say itâs equally about community, connection, and creating friendships. Itâs about being a really integral part of someoneâs life as theyâre settling into a new country.\n\nPartner Profiles is an interview series that spotlights Blockâs community partners â both organizations and individuals â and the work they do to increase access to the economy.\n\nIn this installment of the series, we talk with Hannah Brennan, cofounder and CEO of Scarf, a community organization offering hospitality job training to young refugees and migrants in Australia.\n\nBack in 2010, Hannah Brennan and Jess Moran â two friends and coworkers in Melbourneâs hospitality industry â began working to reduce barriers preventing young refugees and migrants from gaining employment in Australia.

      "# [Partner Profiles: Carolyn âCJâ Johnson â Black Cultural Zone by Block on 2023-12-19](https://block.xyz/inside/partner-profiles-CJ)\nPartner Profiles is an interview series that spotlights Blockâs community partners â both organizations and individuals â and the work they do to increase access to the economy.\n\nIn the inaugural installment of the series, Carolyn Johnson, CEO of Black Cultural Zone, talks to us about Oakland's Uptown Market and more.\n\nWhen Oakland nonprofit EastSide Arts Alliance told Carolyn Johnson, known to colleagues and friends as âCJ,â that they were looking to hire an Executive Director for the East Oakland Black Cultural Zone Collaborative, she did not hesitate to suggest other people for the job. She understood that running a nonprofit is not for the faint of heart. CJ thought her calling was in the private sector. With degrees from UCLA, UC Berkeley School of Public Health, and Columbia University's Graduate School of Business, CJ had a background in real estate and a passion for deals, not nonprofits. But as she learned more about the organization and their plans for a hub in the neighborhood she grew up in, she realized it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. âWhat I came to understand,â she said, âis that this is a movement.\n\nIn 2019, CJ served as the Executive Director of the East Oakland Black Cultural Zone Collaborative and as the founding CEO of the Black Cultural Zone Community Development Corporation, a role sheâs held since 2020. As Executive Director, CJ led a coalition of Black residents, leaders, organizers, and advocates to keep a place for Black culture in a 50-square-block area in East Oakland. As CEO, CJ started and led an emerging community development corporation with a plan to build ten Black Cultural Zone hubs in East Oakland, partner with the collaborative to build a thriving community in East Oakland, and connect this movement with other Black Cultural destinations nationwide.\n\nEarlier this year, CJ and the BCZ collaborated with Block, Inc. (formerly Square, Inc.) to launch Uptown Market. The market is a retail space for vendors from Oaklandâs cultural markets, located on the ground floor of Blockâs downtown Oakland offices at 1955 Broadway. CJ talked to us from New Orleans (where she was attending a conference) about the Rise East Plan and commitment for East Oakland, her role with the BCZ, her vision for the Uptown Market, and more.\n\nBLOCK: What is the Black Cultural Zone? Whatâs the mission of the organization?\n\nCJ: The Black Cultural Zone is actually three things. Itâs a geographic area from High Street in Oakland to the border of the cities of San Leandro and Oakland, from the hills to the water. It's a community development corporation, and it's a collaboration of organizations that support the vision of the Black Cultural Zone. And so what that vision is, in Oakland, is for our legacy Black community to remain, return, and rise in a thriving area that honors, elevates, and protects our legacy and future in the town we love.\n\nI was born and raised in Oakland. In the late seventies, Oakland's population was 51 percent African-American, due primarily to redlining. Then the crack epidemic hit, predatory lending and subsequent foreclosures, and recently, the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. All kinds of things have led to our community being less than 20 percent [of the Oakland population] and projected to be less than 10 percent by 2040.\n\nAnd so we said, âWe need a Black Cultural Zone to anchor our presence in Oakland.\" That's how it got started. [We] really focused on commercial corridors, thinking that if you have business here and jobs here, people can afford to stay. And so I joined in 2019 with my real estate development background. What we envision is that there will be a Black cultural area in this legacy city that will keep the memory of Black people, and hopefully retain and return a strong presence of Black people in this legacy area of East Oakland. Our vision doesnât exclude other cultural groups, which, if you know Oakland, we love our cultural diversity. We just want to make sure we shall remain.\n\nThere are cultural zones all over this country that celebrate and elevate ethnic communities like Little Italy, Chinatown â people are used to that. But there has not been a safe, protected, and thriving Black Cultural Zone that celebrates our culture similarly in America. The history of African-Americans, it's different. We don't have the traditional immigrant story.\n\nBLOCK: What is a typical day for you as CEO of the Black Cultural Zone?\n\nCJ: On the move! After the BCZ was founded, it grew from three people to nearly 40 people. Now I spend more of my time looking outwards and building alliances, bringing in funding, and supporting our stakeholders, and also tend to the team that manages our programs.\n\nBLOCK: Tell me about Uptown Market and how that collaboration with Block came to be.\n\nCJ: Block has supported our economic development work. Again, I realized that we can't just build a marketplace without a pipeline of entrepreneurs; we have to incubate entrepreneurs who are able to sustain an actual brick-and-mortar presence. So, we started something called the AKOMA Market during the pandemic. We expanded that to taking those vendors on the road to festivals around Oakland.\n\nSo we'd been talking about a hub. [Block] asked if we'd be interested in using that space at Uptown Station to incubate and bring the best of Oakland cultural market vendors to that space. And it was like, absolutely! It gives our vendors an opportunity to see what it's like to have to get in at seven, and close at seven. [Editorâs note: Uptown Marketâs holiday hours are Wednesday through Friday, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.]\n\nBLOCK: Whatâs the response been since Uptown Market opened?\n\nCJ: From customers, they're always amazed when they come in. It's such a beautiful space. It's so colorful and lively and we have a mix of retail and food, which gives people a reason to come. And we have events. So it's an experience. Youâve got to get people out of the house after the pandemic. It's a different world. The sellers are excited to be there.\n\nBLOCK: As an East Oakland native, talk to me about the impact you've seen your work have?\n\nCJ: I think the best way I can describe it is believing. The site in East Oakland called Liberation Park used to be a part of a thriving mall complex when I was younger, which ultimately became a police station. And then they abandoned it and it was overrun with weeds. And now we have created an oasis. And I think when people would hear me say, âWe're going to have this roller-skating rink and outdoor movies at this abandoned site which was an eyesore,â they'd be like, âShe is out of her mind.â And now it's there.\n\nPartner Profiles is an interview series that spotlights Blockâs community partners â both organizations and individuals â and the work they do to increase access to the economy.\n\nIn the inaugural installment of the series, Carolyn Johnson, CEO of Black Cultural Zone, talks to us about Oakland's Uptown Market and more.\n\nWhen Oakland nonprofit EastSide Arts Alliance told Carolyn Johnson, known to colleagues and friends as âCJ,â that they were looking to hire an Executive Director for the East Oakland Black Cultural Zone Collaborative, she did not hesitate to suggest other people for the job.

Block will be the name for the company as a corporate entity. The Square name has become synonymous with the companyâs Seller business, which provides an integrated ecosystem of commerce solutions, business software, and banking services for sellers, and this move allows the Seller business to own the Square brand it was built for.\n\nThe change to Block acknowledges the companyâs growth. Since its start in 2009, the company has added Cash App, TIDAL, and TBD54566975 as businesses, and the name change creates room for further growth. Block is an overarching ecosystem of many businesses united by their purpose of economic empowerment, and serves many peopleâindividuals, artists, fans, developers, and sellers.\n\nThe name change to Block distinguishes the corporate entity from its businesses, or building blocks.

As a result of the name change, Square Crypto, a separate initiative of the company dedicated to advancing Bitcoin, will change its name to Spiral.\n\nThe name has many associated meanings for the company â building blocks, neighborhood blocks and their local businesses, communities coming together at block parties full of music, a blockchain, a section of code, and obstacles to overcome.\n\nSquare, Inc. is referred to as âBlockâ in this press release. The legal name âSquare, Inc.â is expected to be legally changed to âBlock, Inc.â on or about December 10, 2021, upon satisfying all applicable legal requirements. The companyâs NYSE ticker symbol âSQâ will not change at this time. Any changes in the future will be publicly disclosed. No action is needed from current stockholders.

With Cash App, anyone can easily send, spend, or invest their money in stocks or Bitcoin. Spiral (formerly Square Crypto) builds and funds free, open-source Bitcoin projects. Artists use TIDAL to help them succeed as entrepreneurs and connect more deeply with fans. TBD54566975 is building an open developer platform to make it easier to access Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies without having to go through an institution.\n\nSquare, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) announced today that it is changing its name to Block. Block will be the name for the company as a corporate entity. The Square name has become synonymous with the companyâs Seller business, which provides an integrated ecosystem of commerce solutions, business software, and banking services for sellers, and this move allows the Seller business to own the Square brand it was built for.\n\nThe change to Block acknowledges the companyâs growth. Since its start in 2009, the company has added Cash App, TIDAL, and TBD54566975 as businesses, and the name change creates room for further growth. Block is an overarching ecosystem of many businesses united by their purpose of economic empowerment, and serves many peopleâindividuals, artists, fans, developers, and sellers.\n\nThe name change to Block distinguishes the corporate entity from its businesses, or building blocks. There will be no organizational changes, and Square, Cash App, TIDAL, and TBD54566975 will continue to maintain their respective brands. A foundational workforce, which includes teams such as Counsel, People, and Finance, will continue to help guide the ecosystem at the corporate level. As a result of the name change, Square Crypto, a separate initiative of the company dedicated to advancing Bitcoin, will change its name to Spiral.\n\nThe name has many associated meanings for the company â building blocks, neighborhood blocks and their local businesses, communities coming together at block parties full of music, a blockchain, a section of code, and obstacles to overcome.\n\nSquare, Inc. is referred to as âBlockâ in this press release. The legal name âSquare, Inc.â is expected to be legally changed to âBlock, Inc.â on or about December 10, 2021, upon satisfying all applicable legal requirements. The companyâs NYSE ticker symbol âSQâ will not change at this time. Any changes in the future will be publicly disclosed. No action is needed from current stockholders. The Companyâs Class A common stock will continue to be listed on NYSE and the CUSIP will not be changing.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.block.xyz or follow company news via Twitter @blocks and @blockIR.

      "# [A New Mural for Uptown Market by Block on 2024-05-07](https://block.xyz/inside/uptown-market-mural)\nPartner Profiles is an interview series that spotlights Blockâs community partners â both organizations and individuals â and the work they do to increase access to the economy.\n\nIn this installment, we talked with Timothy B, the artist behind the new mural in our Oakland Community Hub, commissioned by the Bay Area Mural Program (BAMP).\n\nIn March, the Bay Area Mural Program (BAMP) unveiled a colorful new mural in Oaklandâs Uptown Station building, which houses Blockâs downtown offices. The mural decorates Uptown Market in the buildingâs ground floor Oakland Community Hub, a Block-founded space dedicated to supporting local community groups, sellers, and artists. BAMP is a nonprofit program that fosters collaboration between local artists and the community â the organization also curates an art program throughout the community hub. For the Uptown Market mural, BAMP commissioned Oakland painter Timothy B to create a work celebrating the community. He delivered. We sat down with the artist to talk about creative inspiration, entrepreneurship, and the power of public art.\n\nWhat about Oakland inspires you, and how does it show up in your art?\n\nI think we have a very beautiful culture [in Oakland], from the music and fashion, to our language and how we communicate with one another, especially within certain communities. I don't know what that is, but [Oaklanders] just have our own style in the way that we go about everything. We really have a tribe mindset. So I'm inspired by how we express ourselves, how we talk, how we think, and the love that we show to one another.\n\nWhat led you to creating murals? I read somewhere that you started as a tattoo artist.\n\nIâve always had an entrepreneurial spirit. And when I was starting out, I was trying to figure out how to make money from my art. So I started drawing tattoos for people, but it wasnât until I saw someone come back with one of my designs as a tattoo that I thought, âOh, I bet I could do that.â Along with that, I went to a tattoo convention and it was my first time seeing a Black tattoo artist. I had been following their work before, but seeing them in person gave me the belief that I could be in this world.\n\nIt wasnât until I moved back to Oakland, started working at Oakland Ink, that I realized tattooing â working in a studio â wasnât for me. I wanted to be outside, be in the community. But also I wanted to see my art broadcasted for the world to see. Thatâs what got me exploring muraling. I met some guys who were painting a mural, and they invited me to come paint. And I fell in love with it instantly. And I never looked back.\n\nLooking at your work, I connect elements to Afrofuturism. Did that movement influence your style for this work?\n\nYes. I think itâs important for Black people to see themselves in the future, especially because in the past there were no depictions of us in the future. So itâs time to make change.\n\nAnother thing that inspired [this mural] was old school Oakland. I grew up during the hyphy movement. So remembering aspects of the movement, the dances, the fashion that came out during that time â I wanted to show reflections of that, and explore how it could look going forward. Because a lot of us are still hyphingâ¦we still have that creativity, that energy, that fire. And how do we preserve that culture now that our city is changing, the landscape and culture are changing?\n\nPartner Profiles is an interview series that spotlights Blockâs community partners â both organizations and individuals â and the work they do to increase access to the economy.\n\nIn this installment, we talked with Timothy B, the artist behind the new mural in our Oakland Community Hub, commissioned by the Bay Area Mural Program (BAMP).\n\nIn March, the Bay Area Mural Program (BAMP) unveiled a colorful new mural in Oaklandâs Uptown Station building, which houses Blockâs downtown offices.

The deciding factor for my uninstalling the game was when it ended a board by not providing any pieces that would allow the board to continue.

The only downside of .xyz is, that its by default considered SPAM because a lot of people registered numeric .xyz and used it to SPAM the shit out of it, because they cost like a dollar per year. Cheap is not always good. Paying 9$ more per year is often worth it.

Just today I got a text from a sender who claimed to be the US Postal Service about some package from outside the country being held up in customs.  The link that the text message instructed me to follow was \"us-usps-*jibberish*-.xyz/i\"   I am going to state here that any time the domain seems odd, its most likely a scam or phishing attempt.  The US Postal service has a domain that they use for everything so it seems like a no-brainer.  DO NOT click it or copy/paste, etc.   Now with that said, it's not simply a problem of any business using .xyz, but it is a problem with a sender claiming to be someone I do transact with asking me to follow a link to a domain that has a questionable address/URL.\n\nI am sure I am not the first to warn you about this kind of thing.\n\nCarry on and stay safe my friends.

But for some reason whenever I pass 'Z=76' the command completely stops working.\n\nThe command block is set to always active, Repeat.\n\nI've probably made a mistake somewhere but can someone please help me figure it out.\n\n## Comment ID fml4qto with +1 score by [(DanRileyCG, Reddit, 2020-04-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftCommands/comments/fvrspe/can_i_have_some_help_with_dx_dy_dz_commands/fml4qto/) (in reply to ID fvrspe):\nSo I'm confused... I wasted my time writing a complete response like 10ish hours ago in a duplicate thread by you and now the thread is gone and you never saw my comment??? What??\n\nHere's what I said:\n\nI have answers for you.\n\nDx, dy, and dz count from the designated x, y, z coordinates by whatever number you input. So if you started with an x=10,y=10,z=10 and use dx=20,dy=20,dz=20 it will basically count twenty blocks from the 10 (which is the same as adding 20 to the initial xyz values). So it would create a perfect square that would effectively span from the already mentioned xyz values to a second xyz value of x=30,y=30,z=30. So you're not inputting actual coordinates into dx, dy, dz but the number of blocks you want to check against from the initial xyz coordinates in either a positive or negative direction. If you want the square or rectangle shape (can't be prism even though you said prism) to reach a specific xyz coordinates you just have to use simple math. For example you can subtract the smaller xyz values from the larger ones and that will give you what you need for the dx, dy, dz. In this example, you could have worked backwards and if you knew you wanted the square to reach x, y, z = 30 you can subtract 10 from 30 and get 20 (the dx, dy, dz value).\n\nWhen you say you want payers to die when they go past y=175 I'm assuming that the players are all above this point and would never be below it or they'd end up dying, right? Assuming that's the case it's a very simple single line of code.\n\n    Execute @a[y=0,dy=175] ~~~ kill @p\n\nThe following code should work too...\n\n    kill @a[y=0,dy=175]\n\nThese codes will kill any player between y=0 and y=175 instantly.\n\nSo do you get it now?\n\n### Comment ID fmnyy8d with +1 score by [(Rando-Random, Reddit, 2020-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftCommands/comments/fvrspe/can_i_have_some_help_with_dx_dy_dz_commands/fmnyy8d/) (in reply to ID fml4qto):\nYeah, Sorry about that.

They both work flawlessly. Despite knowing that they should, I just tested them and they do work flawlessly. Either you typed them in wrong, don't have them in a repeating always active, unconditional block, or you were in creative mode when you tested them. You can't be killed even by commands in creative mode.\n\nIf you want a simple way to test them you can instead type this:\n\nEither will work:\n\nRepeating, always active, unconditional, 20 ticks of delay.\nExecute @a[y=0,dy=175] ~~~ say Working\n\nRepeating, always active, unconditional, 20 ticks of delay.\nMsg @a[y=0,dy=175] Working\n\nNow you can fly around and creative and will see that it stops working at y=176.\n\nIf you did the command that you suggested it would only be able to kill someone if they were exactly on y=175. Which if it's running fast enough should be enough. They shouldn't be able to fall through. But either way the code I suggested ensures there's no way that they can be below there.",

Compare it to an electric field. If you are in between two plates of a capacitor, the individual point charges that surround you create a uniform electric field orthogonal to the plates. This is the same theoretical effect that can happen with gravity. \n\nImagine that the Minecraft world is flat (which it pretty much is), and there is a very large and dense plane of matter below the surface creating a gravitational field. This gravitational field is uniform (this is due to the fact that the plane of the earth is practically infinite in size in relation to the player). For all intents and purposes of the game, this gravitational field would be practically the same as if the player was on a spherical planet with a center of gravity. The only case where this representation is flawed is when dealing with other VERY large bodies of mass, such as planets, but there are no other planets in Minecraft. \n\nEffectively, the earth in this game is never in a frame of reference in which the planet itself is treated as a point charge, or point mass... I guess ;), so the center of gravity is essentially a non-factor.\n\n#### Comment ID dxtoem5 with +3 score by [(oscillating000, Reddit, 2018-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/8e5jeb/mind_blowing_explanation_as_to_why_1_block_in_the/dxtoem5/) (in reply to ID dxt1jw0):\nPick a point on the map, then move in a single direction.

For starters you could imagine that the source of gravity is a plane existing on a negative Y value. If you think further you'll come to a point where you notice that even this model doesn't work anymore, since gravity doesn't change for very high Y as it should. There is no escape velocity, so gravity in Minecraft is actually a force that affects you in the same way and amount no matter where in X Y Z you are.*\n\nThis also is the reason why your theory that the Minecraft world is spherical doesn't work. A sphere with a central source of gravitational force has an escape velocity. Minecraft doesn't.\n\n\\* Unsurprisingly that's how gravity works in the game engine/source code.\n\n## Comment ID dxsrafd with +200 score by [(yodathegiant, Reddit, 2018-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/8e5jeb/mind_blowing_explanation_as_to_why_1_block_in_the/dxsrafd/) (in reply to ID 8e5jeb):\nI didn't realize that this was mind blowing, I thought it was common sense. You can look *physically* at the game to see that there is void below bedrock in the overworld and in the nether, but if you look within the confines of the game without cheating, you find bedrock at the bottom of the overworld, and at the top of the nether with no way to pass between them. Since Minecraft is basically supposed to be earth (or some other planet, that's unimportant), *thematically* it's obvious that the nether is supposed to be closer to the center of the earth, and that's why you travel \"faster\" in the Nether, and when you portal up it places you 8 times further than you've traveled. \n\nYou can talk about how the game is coded, but ultimately there's a void below bedrock because of programming limitations.

With infinite (if you don't have the Farlands) surface area, radius, etc., except it doesn't go to the centre of the sphere.\n\nObviously this implies an infinitely large sphere, but that's why you can't physically go between the Overworld and the Nether, because the distance between their depths is also infinite.\n\nAnd here's the beautiful thing about this: every MC world can exist on the surface of the same infinite sphere. They never intersect, because it's infinite, but they're all there.\n\nAs to the End: apparently every one of the 128 End portals connects to just one portal in the End, so rather than being above the Overworld, the End is just further below the Nether, infinitely far below it. The End portal is at the point of the 'sector', which isn't really a sector because the point isn't at the centre of the sphere, but is at some point above the centre, given that each world's End is different.\n\nThis does mean that the sun & moon are travelling infinitely fast around the sphere (or the sphere's rotating infinitely fast around its axis), which does admittedly make me feel uncomfortable, but I can live with that.\n\nI do think that the sun & moon complicate things somewhat, as iirc, they travel across the sky directly overhead, which means they're both at an infinite distance from the sphere to make any travelling distance of the player negligible to their positions in the sky. And it's possible that instead of a sphere, the multiverse is a cylinder, with every world lined up, where the sun & moon rise on each world one after the other.\n\n## Comment ID dxtfday with +2 score by [(CounterSkil, Reddit, 2018-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/8e5jeb/mind_blowing_explanation_as_to_why_1_block_in_the/dxtfday/) (in reply to ID 8e5jeb):\nCheckmate Flat Earthers\n\n## Comment ID dxtj923 with +2 score by [(implicature, Reddit, 2018-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/8e5jeb/mind_blowing_explanation_as_to_why_1_block_in_the/dxtj923/) (in reply to ID 8e5jeb):\nSolution: Minecraft world is flat but [non-Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_half-plane_model)\n\n\n\n## Comment ID dxsj00j with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/8e5jeb/mind_blowing_explanation_as_to_why_1_block_in_the/dxsj00j/) (in reply to ID 8e5jeb):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID dxsj73e with +13 score by [(TehNolz, Reddit, 2018-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/8e5jeb/mind_blowing_explanation_as_to_why_1_block_in_the/dxsj73e/) (in reply to ID dxsj00j):\n[That's not where \"Overworld\" comes from.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overworld)\n\n### Comment ID dxsojuk with +12 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-04-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/8e5jeb/mind_blowing_explanation_as_to_why_1_block_in_the/dxsojuk/) (in reply to ID dxsj00j):\nYou and I have different definitions of the word proof.

You can use a clock that will expose the villagers every 37 seconds to the hostile mob for a few seconds and then conceals the rest of the time.  I did this using a hopper clock with stack and half of items the led into a decay clock that removed glass block for duration of decay clock then put back.

I can't stand when attack buttons are on the shoulders, and if I can't change it to X and Y then I'm not likely to play the game.\n\nAt least for melee games. Shooters are the exception - but if you're using a melee weapon, you should be using X and Y imo. Maybe it's just because I started gaming before shoulder buttons exist - but it doesn't make any sense to me for them to not be X and Y.\n\nWhatever the rest of the controls are - X and Y are attack, A is jump, and if there's a block it should be LB, and if there's an aim it should be LT. And if I can't remap to this - I know I'm not going to play it.\n\n### Comment ID lbjyf4p with +1 score by [(thisiskyle77, Reddit, 2024-07-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMythWukong/comments/1du54c4/black_myth_is_not_like_xyz_game_you_can_compare/lbjyf4p/) (in reply to ID lbed1tv):\nAs an old gamer , I always re map attacks to Square and Triangle.

My team and hundreds of others had absolutely no notice we would be impacted before the end of January, when we received an email informing us it would be our last day. 2/9 people on my team kept their jobs: they were the only two white, straight men on the team. Likely unintentional, but not a good look, Square.\n\n6 months prior to the huge layoff, upper management had made vague announcements about upcoming layoffs, but with no specifics. Around that time, my department lost 3 major leaders - one laid off, one quit, and the other found a new job.",

After the team favorites were promoted the promo rules magically changed. Now you need a \"business need\" for your promotion so you're essentially stuck in your level unless you switch roles or your exec is promoted; I supported some of the worst execs in my EA career at Block, Inc. which is crazy because Block has great people but some of the senior leaders (across the company) aren't so great and are instead super problematic with poor internal reputations. Before the layoffs, politics in the EO department was insane. Some leads give a lot of lip service and will act like they support you and are \"there\" for you but actually aren't. Some leads literally don't respect confidentiality and run their mouths like teenagers in high school.",

They are more interested in playing office politics than in leading the team effectively. Feedback is often ignored or met with hostility.\nHigh Turnover: The company has an extremely high turnover rate, which speaks volumes about the underlying issues. Employees often leave within a year, leading to a lack of continuity and constant training of new hires.\nWork-Life Imbalance: Despite claims of supporting work-life balance, the reality is that you're expected to be available 24/7. Burnout is common, and there's little regard for personal time.\nLack of Growth Opportunities: There is little to no room for growth or career development. Promotions are rare and seem to be based on favoritism rather than merit.",

The true test of character (for both people and companies) is when things get difficult.\n\nBlock talks a big game about economic empowerment and valuing its people. But their 2023 layoffs demonstrate that their rhetoric has become threadbare. When they are done with you they don’t hesitate to discard you with little to show for it. \n\nLayoffs are a fact of life. But decent companies treat their people decently, even when those people are on the way out. \n\nYes, the odds of you getting laid off are slim. But Block’s recent stingy exit packages are not consistent with their past. It is indicative of a cultural shift away from valuing people.\n\nHere is a table of the relative size of exit packages compared to the company’s size (a measure of the depth of their finances). The data are normalized so Block = 100%.\n\nBlock, Market cap = 100%, Exit package = 100% \nStripe, Market cap =125%, Exit package = 375% \nDoorDash, Market cap = 63%, Exit package = 288%\nPlaid, Market cap = 34%, Exit package = 325%\nLyft, Market cap = 10%, Exit package = 325%\nCoursera, Market cap = 5%, Exit package = 341%\n\n“Exit package” includes the notification period (period where you are no longer working but still on the payroll), any stock vested or bonus paid after notification of layoff, and severance.\n\nNaturally, Block’s package also pales in comparison to those of larger companies. Salesforce's severance was 6x Block's, Alphabet's was more than 4x, and Meta's was 3.5x Block's exit package.",

I worked with a few horrible ones. \nInsane amount of middle management layers. Gossip was a mainstay especially within Executive Operations. Very easy to fall out of someone’s good graces. \nProximity bias is alive &amp; well especially in Exec Ops (i.e. if you go into the offices and pretended to be happy to grab lunches then that catapulted you in the eyes of the leads). People would outright say how they gamed this system for advancement. \nVery easy to get trapped in your level and/or your role (company-wide issue)\nExtreme &amp; unchecked pandemic hiring sent the company into equally extreme layoffs\nThere is an illusion of transparency",

My first year or so, I couldn't imagine ever working anywhere else, but the it all went south. Massive and quick hiring, endless budget, and uncontrolled product offering/strategy spread led to lots of chaos, exec favoritism/cliques, org silos, product non-interoperability, territory grabs and inexperienced and unsupported management promotions causing a lot of unnecessary conflict and drama. There is a lot of change still settling there. It could turn out well now that there seems to be a bit more intentional corporate structure, but if you are interested in working there, really interview your hiring manager critically. I still believe strongly in the core product offering and wish them success, but it came with A LOT of extra headaches that were not worth it for me. I love solving hard product problems, but when you don't have the support of the organization and your own management to actually achieve that, it was time for me to go.",

I still believe strongly in the core product offering and wish them success, but it came with A LOT of extra headaches that were not worth it for me. I love solving hard product problems, but when you don't have the support of the organization and your own management to actually achieve that, it was time for me to go.",

      "# [Is SQ Stock A Buy? Here's What The Fundamentals, Square Stock Chart Show by REINHARDT KRAUSE, Reinhardt-Krause, Investor's Business Daily on 2024-09-30](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sq-stock-buy-now/)\nSome fintech stocks are rebounding in 2024. Think PayPal Holdings (PYPL). But not Square parent Block (SQ). Both Cash App growth and the direction of the merchant business remain key to Square stock. Also, the Afterpay consumer financing business is key for SQ stock.\n\n↑ X NOW PLAYING From Artificial Intelligence To Interest Rate Cuts, Here's How Investors Can Win Big In 2024\n\nIn its core businesses, Square aims to build a two-sided digital payments ecosystem, with products designed for both merchant sellers and consumer buyers.\n\nPayPal Stock Rebounds, Square Still In Dog House\n\nUnder new Chief Executive Alex Chriss, PayPal has rebounded in 2024, advancing 26%. With the gain, PayPal stock trades above a 5% buy zone.\n\nMeanwhile, Square faces growing competition on many fronts. In 2023, Block replaced the head of its merchant Square business, Alyssa Henry, with Block and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey.\n\nDespite the leadership change, Square stock has retreated 13% in 2024.\n\nWhile Block's valuation has dropped, IBD doesn't put much weight on P/E ratios and other valuation metrics. On the other hand, here are some time-tested trading rules.\n\nFor the June quarter, Block reported EPS that topped estimates while revenue came in light. Gross profit and adjusted EBITDA beat Wall Street targets.\n\nFor 2024, the company raised its gross profit outlook to $8.89 billion, up from prior $8.78 billion. The company said Afterpay CEO and co-founder Nick Molnar will lead a new a centralized sales function.\n\nSQ Stock: Cash App Growth Key\n\nAlso, some investors fear potential weakness in Square's point-of-sale business amid growing competitive pressures from Toast (TOST) in restaurants and Fiserv's (FISV) Clover unit generally.\n\nThe Square Cash App helps individuals manage money, buy stocks and cryptocurrency, and more. New banking services may be key to Cash App's growth.\n\nBlock aims to bridge the Cash App and merchant ecosystems with consumer financing services from Afterpay. Buy now, pay later firm Afterpay competes with Affirm Holdings (AFRM) and many others. Affirm stock climbed on its fiscal 2025 outlook.\n\nThe Square Cash App, a peer-to-peer money-transfer service, competes with PayPal's Venmo, Zelle and others.\n\nIn late 2021, Square changed its name to Block, while retaining the ticker SQ. Meanwhile, the move reflected the company's commitment to blockchain technology, which underpins cryptocurrency.\n\nBlock has aimed to build infrastructure that enables bitcoin-based commerce on its merchant platform. In addition, Square created a new business line to help developers build financial services products focused on Bitcoin.\n\nIn January, Square said its Bitcoin digital wallet was available for Cash App users in 95 countries.\n\nSQ Stock: Afterpay Acquisition\n\nSquare and Marqeta (MQ) in 2023 said they have renewed their transaction services agreement for Cash App and Afterpay.\n\nIn 2023, Block sued Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) on antitrust grounds, alleging that both credit card networks are overcharging U.S. merchants through high cost interchange and merchant location fees.\n\nIn the event a U.S. recession eventually hits, one question is how resistant Square will be to a business downturn. The relatively low income levels of Square's customer base is one factor for investors to consider if the U.S. economy weakens, analysts say.\n\nIn a move to boost its Cash App business, Square in early 2022 closed the acquisition of Australia-based consumer lending startup Afterpay. \"Buy now, pay later\" (BNPL) companies such as Afterpay compete with credit card networks.\n\nIn another deal, Square acquired a majority stake in Jay-Z's Tidal music streaming service for $297 million in cash and stock.\n\nBlock Stock: Competition Heats Up\n\nIn 2023, Square management outlined a new long-term investment framework, which will put the company on the road to higher quality earnings under generally accepted accounting principles, often known as GAAP.\n\nOne bright spot: Square holds $5 billion on its balance sheet. In addition, Square stock uses a dual class structure of common stock, which gives insiders more voting power.\n\nWith multiple products, SQ stock faces stiff competition in both consumer financial apps and the small business market. Rivals include PayPal Holdings (PYPL), First Data's (FDC) Clover unit, Shopify (SHOP), merchant acquirers, and well-funded startup Stripe.\n\nFor merchants, Square makes credit-card readers that plug into mobile devices. Its Square Capital division provides loans to sellers.\n\nWith roots in serving such micro-merchants as food trucks and farm-stand vendors, Square has moved \"upmarket,\" targeting larger businesses.\n\nIn addition to selling credit-card readers, Square provides software for point-of-sale and back offices in order to manage inventory and other tasks.\n\nSquare recently focused on software products that can be used across many industries, such as invoicing, payroll and marketing. It also aims to integrate its payment tools into e-commerce platforms.\n\nIs SQ Stock A Buy Right Now?\n\nSquare's Relative Strength Rating stands at 45 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The best stocks tend to have an 80 or better RS Rating.\n\nThe relative strength line, the blue line in the chart above, compares a stock's price performance with that of the S&P 500. A downward-trending RS line tells you the stock is underperforming the general market.\n\nBlock stock holds an IBD Composite Rating of 72 out of a best possible 99.\n\nSQ stock, meanwhile, holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of C-plus. The rating runs from a best-possible A+ to a worst-possible E. The rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, SQ stock is not actionable. It needs to form a proper base.\n\nFollow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nWant To Trade Options?

      "# [Federal prosecutors are examining financial transactions at Block, owner of Cash App and Square by Gretchen Morgenson on 2024-05-01](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/prosecutors-examining-transactions-block-owner-cash-app-squarc-rcna147181)\nFederal prosecutors are digging into internal practices at Block, the financial technology firm launched by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, discussing with a former employee alleged widespread and yearslong compliance lapses at the company’s two main units, Square and Cash App, two people with direct knowledge of the contacts say.\n\nDuring the discussions, the former employee provided prosecutors from the Southern District of New York documents that they say show that insufficient information is collected from Square and Cash App customers to assess their risks, that Square processed thousands of transactions involving countries subject to economic sanctions and that Block processed multiple cryptocurrency transactions for terrorist groups.\n\nMost of the transactions discussed with prosecutors, involving credit card transactions, dollar transfers and Bitcoin, were not reported to the government as required, the former employee said. Block did not correct company processes when it was alerted to the breaches, the former employee told prosecutors and NBC News.\n\nRoughly 100 pages of documents the former employee provided to NBC News identify transactions, many in small dollar amounts, involving entities in countries subject to U.S. sanctions restrictions — Cuba, Iran, Russia and Venezuela — as recently as last year.\n\n“From the ground up, everything in the compliance section was flawed,” the former employee told NBC News. “It is led by people who should not be in charge of a regulated compliance program.”\n\nA second person with direct knowledge of Block’s monitoring programs and practices echoed that assessment; NBC News granted the former employee and the second person anonymity to guard against potential reprisals.\n\nThe Southern District of New York declined to comment.\n\nEdward Siedle, a former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer who represents the former employee and participated in the discussions with prosecutors, said, “It’s my understanding from the documents that compliance lapses were known to Block leadership and the board in recent years.”\n\nProsecutors met with the former employee after NBC News reported in mid-February that two other whistleblowers had told financial regulators about compliance failures at Cash App, the hugely popular mobile payment platform owned by Block. Cash App, introduced in 2013, allows users to send and receive money instantaneously among themselves and to buy stocks and Bitcoin. As of December, Cash App had 56 million active transacting accounts and $248 billion in inflows during the previous four quarters, the company said.\n\nAsked about the probe, a Block spokeswoman provided the following statement: “Block has a responsible and extensive compliance program and we regularly adapt our practices to meet emerging threats and an evolving sanctions regulatory environment. Our compliance program includes systems, tools, and processes for sanctions screening, as well as investigating and reporting on sanctions issues in accordance with our regulatory obligations. Continually improving the safety and security of our ecosystem is a top priority for Block. We have been and remain committed to building upon this work, as well as continuing to invest significantly in our compliance program.”\n\nThe company said it believed it had voluntarily reported the “thousands of transactions” described by the former employee to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, a department of the U.S. Treasury that enforces economic sanctions. But the former employee disputed that, saying thousands of different transactions were not reported.\n\nBlock’s voluntary self-disclosure to OFAC led the agency to issue a no-action letter, indicating the closure of the investigation with no administrative action. The letter identified Cash App transactions, the company said, adding that the resolution confirmed Block’s analysis of its controls and processes companywide.\n\nSquare, the other main business unit at Block, is a financial services platform used by millions of merchants. Documents provided to prosecutors and reviewed by NBC News identify instances at Square when it failed to conduct basic customer due diligence on its international merchant sellers and improperly reimbursed some of the merchants’ funds that had been frozen for sanctions violations. (Merchants are considered customers at Square, while users are considered customers at Cash App.) New customers at both Square and Cash App who triggered sanctions alerts at their initial screenings were permitted to conduct transactions before the alerts were resolved, the documents say. They also show instances of employees’ flagging that customer biography information, such as linked social media accounts, was not screened against sanctions keyword lists.\n\nCash App’s design increased the risk of compliance lapses, the documents indicate. “Due to the nature of the product,” a document said, “customers do not appear to leave stored balances in Cash App very long so our ability to block a stored balance or reject funds is limited. In virtually all situations, balances have been depleted by the time of review.”\n\nBlock said sanctions risk on Cash App is mitigated by compliance controls and the nature of the customer base, focused on U.S. customers.\n\nThe former employee also told prosecutors about the findings of an outside consultant Block hired to assess its internal systems for monitoring suspicious activities, rating customer risks and screening for sanctions violations. The consultant identified almost 50 deficiencies in those systems last year, the documents show.\n\nIn its response to NBC News, the company said the hiring of the consultant showed Block’s commitment to perform and improve compliance, adding that 50 deficiencies were not unusual given the report’s scope. The former employee’s interpretation of the report misconstrues its findings and their significance, the company said.\n\nThe company declined to answer questions about the specific deficiencies cited in the documents. It said that when deficiencies are identified, Block works “with our in-house legal team, as well as with outside counsel and consultants, to advise us on the issue and appropriate remediation.” The company conducts recurring sanctions screening on all merchants, it said, and its program includes the essential components expected by OFAC.\n\nOFAC administers and enforces economic sanctions to protect the nation against “targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists and terrorist organizations, weapons of mass destruction proliferators, narcotic traffickers, and others,” according to its website. It “strongly encourages” companies to develop, implement and routinely update sanctions compliance programs. “Senior management’s commitment to, and support of, an organization’s risk-based sanctions compliance program is one of the most important factors in determining its success,” OFAC says, and it is essential to fostering “a culture of compliance throughout the organization.”\n\nAlong with senior management, the Block board of directors was informed of extensive lapses at the company, the former employee told prosecutors. In recent months, Block has announced the unexpected departures of two directors: Lawrence Summers, the former U.S. treasury secretary and a Block director since 2011, resigned in February, and in April it said Sharon Rothstein, a director since 2022, will not stand for re-election at the company’s annual meeting in June.\n\nBlock said that Summers and Rothstein were leaving the board to devote more time to other professional and personal activities and that their departures were not “a result of any disagreements with the company on any matter relating to the company’s operations, policies or practices.”\n\nDuring his time on the board, Summers served on the audit committee, which is charged with reviewing and discussing with management the company’s program and policies on risk assessment and risk management. The committee is overseen by Lord Paul Deighton, a former Goldman Sachs executive who was commercial secretary to the treasury in the U.K. government from 2013 to 2015. NBC News requested interviews with Deighton and Summers, but they declined, forwarding the requests to Block’s corporate communications unit.\n\nBlock has encountered difficulties with regulators before. In late 2021, the Financial Market Supervisory Committee of the Bank of Lithuania ordered Verse Payments Lithuania UAB, the company’s European version of Cash App, to determine the identity of its existing clients whose identities had not been established or had been established out of compliance with the law on Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing.\n\nVerse and its former head were fined last year when the Bank of Lithuania inspected Verse and “found serious and systematic violations of the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing.” The top Verse executive “did not ensure the safe and reliable operation of the institution, did not take effective measures to eliminate violations and did not ensure the compliance of the institution’s activities with the established requirements, although information about the violations committed by the institution was known to him for a long time,” the Bank of Lithuania said at the time.\n\nBlock shut down Verse last year. On an earnings call in August, Dorsey said that Verse required significant investment and that its market had “not seen the growth and profitability we had expected.”\n\nMobile payment apps like Cash App, PayPal and Venmo are popular, with over three-quarters of U.S. adults using them, according to a study last year by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. Known as person-to-person payment platforms, the services pose risks to their users and to the financial system, regulators say. In recent years, for example, law enforcement officials have cited criminals’ use of payment apps to evade laws, such as laundering stolen Covid relief funds in 2020.\n\nCash App is not a bank, but it uses external banking partners to conduct various services. One is Sutton Bank, the small Ohio institution that issues Cash App’s prepaid Visa debit cards, allowing users to spend or withdraw their funds. Banks are required to know every one of their customers, but the Cash App program “had no effective procedure to establish the identity of its customers,” the previous whistleblowers said in their complaints to federal financial regulators.\n\nOn March 29, Sutton Bank settled a consent order with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. that echoed the whistleblowers’ allegations. In the order, the FDIC alleged “unsafe or unsound banking practices and violations of law or regulation” at Sutton, including those relating to the Bank Secrecy Act.\n\nUnder the order, Sutton agreed to revise its internal programs to “improve its supervision and direction” of its anti-money laundering and terrorism financing program and “to assure and maintain the Bank’s full compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act.” Sutton also agreed to look back to July 2020 “to ensure that all required customer identification program information has been obtained and the bank has formed a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity” of its customers.\n\nThe FDIC order cited Sutton Bank’s work with “third parties” or outside entities and required it to provide details about anti-money-laundering compliance and customer identification programs at the outside companies it works with. The FDIC did not name Cash App in the order, but it is the largest third party that Sutton Bank works with, according to its chief compliance officer. The FDIC order also required Sutton to provide quarterly reporting of “third-party compliance with legal, contractual, and service level responsibilities, and management actions to address anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism deficiencies.”\n\nJames Booker, senior counsel at Sutton Bank, said in an email that the bank is working closely with regulators and that the recent consent order “settled some longstanding issues concerning anti-money laundering controls” that had arisen “prior to the bank’s 2023 restructuring of its anti-money laundering program.”\n\nAs for Block, it said the Sutton consent order was not likely to affect Cash App’s ongoing business relationship with the bank.",

The company’s second quarter gross profit grew 20% year over year to $2.23 billion. Block’s Square business generated gross profit of $923 million, up 15% year over year, while Cash App generated gross profit of $1.3 billion, up 23% year over year.\n\nAnd the company used Thursday’s investor call to announce an internal reorganization designed to continue growth and accelerate go-to-market strength.\n\n“We are moving Block to a functional organization, meaning an employee’s discipline (e.g. engineering, design, product, or sales), will drive who they report to and how they work. In line with this change, Nick Molnar, co-founder of Afterpay, will be elevated to be our Head of Sales across Block,” the company said in a statement provided to PYMNTS.\n\n“We can realize better engineering, design and product by putting engineering, design and product at the top of the company,” Jack Dorsey, Block head, Square head, chairman and co-founder of Block, said to investors.\n\nRead also: Cash App Exiting UK to Increase Focus on US\n\nBlock Wants to be a Bank\n\nPer its materials, Block believes there is an opportunity to make Cash App the primary financial services partner of choice for families earning up to $150,000 by driving paycheck deposit adoption and increasing inflows.\n\nThe company refers to this as its “bank the base” strategy and recently started testing incentives to drive new paycheck deposit actives as a growth strategy.\n\n“The incentives matter here,” Dorsey said.\n\n“It is about making Cash App our base’s primary financial tool,” Block CFO Amrita Ahuja added. “Which ultimately leads to stronger engagement and stronger inflows.”\n\nThe Cash App Card reached 24 million monthly actives in June, up 13% year over year, while inflows per active user saw healthy growth, up 10% year over year in the quarter.\n\nBlock’s overall transaction-based revenue was $1.71 billion in the second quarter of 2024, up 5% year over year, and transaction-based gross profit was $713 million, up 4% year over year.\n\n“The most important thing is our platform and making sure we have something that is reliable. … We’ve taken hits in the past when the service goes down,” said Dorsey. “We do not want to take any time away from our businesses.”\n\nThe company’s subscription and services-based revenue was $1.79 billion in the second quarter of 2024, up 22% year over year, and subscription and services-based gross profit was $1.5 billion, up 27% year over year.\n\nRead more: Block Says Bitcoin Holdings Allow It to Study Technology’s Potential\n\nSquare’s card-present gross payment volume (GPV) was up 9% year over year, while card-not-present GPV was up 4% year over year. Square GPV is defined as the total dollar amount of all card payments processed by sellers using Square, net of refunds, and ACH transfers.\n\nGross profit from Square’s vertical point-of-sale solutions, including Square Appointments, Square for Restaurants, and Square for Retail, was up 21% year over year, while gross profit from Square’s banking products, which primarily include Square Loans, Instant Transfer, and Square Debit Card, grew 27% year over year.\n\nThis strength was driven by “continued strong demand for loans and our ability to find opportunities to deliver lending solutions to our customers while maintaining underwriting discipline,” the company noted in its materials. During the second quarter, Square Loans facilitated approximately 142,000 loans totaling $1.45 billion in originations, up 32% year over year.",

      "# [Walk Down the Block: Nubian Square ponders its past, present and future as Black Boston's center by Paris Alston, www.wgbh.org, paris-alston on 2023-11-13](https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2023-11-13/walk-down-the-block-nubian-square)\nLet’s take a walk down the block.\n\nToday, we’re in Nubian Square. We’re standing on the corner of Malcolm X Boulevard and Washington Street, right in front of the Faces of Dudley mural on the side of Silver Slipper Cafe, a neighborhood staple.\n\nIf you’ve ever driven through here or caught a bus at Nubian Station, you’ve likely seen it: A dreamy cloud of pink fills in the spaces between Black faces, looking sharp in their crisp white shirts and colorful suits.\n\nThe mural features faces of homegrown activists mixed in with everyday people playing chess, getting their hair done, or just passing through what was then called Dudley Station.\n\n“This has always just sort of captured what my neighborhood has meant,” said Rufus J. Faulk, who's lived in Roxbury most of his 41 years. “We got a picture of Brother Malcolm. A picture of Melnea Cass. Everything in between. It’s sort of the Roxbury I grew up with and love.”\n\nIn his lifetime, Faulk has seen a lot of changes, like the elevated railway being reduced to a bus terminal in the 1980s and voters renaming the area in 2019, from Dudley Square to Nubian Square, to better reflect the people who live and work here.\n\n“My earliest memories of Dudley, now Nubian Square, is riding in the elevated rail with my mother,” he said. “Once we hit this curve to go into the actual train station, it was like, sparks would fly, and it always felt like there was a lot of commotion. But once you got off the train, you saw local stores, you saw local people. It felt so vibrant. It felt like sort of the center of Black Boston.”\n\nBlack Boston has been a big topic this year, from the unveiling of The Embrace in January, a monument that honors Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King, to the NAACP National Convention in July.\n\nPlus, events like the Boston While Black Summit and Family Reunion, or the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts’ Mass Black Expo — all highlighting the city’s Black culture and power.\n\nBut what have they meant for this neighborhood, long-considered the center of Black culture in Boston?\n\nOf course, there are exceptions. But overall, there are notable socioeconomic differences between here and the rest of the city. In 2020, the American City Coalition found the area’s median household income is a little over $41,000 — nearly $30,000 lower than the city of Boston as a whole.\n\nWhile dozens of businesses here are Black-owned, many of them have been struggling since the pandemic. That's been true for Final Touch boutique, where we met Roxbury Main Streets Executive Director Robert George.\n\nBusinesses like these didn't get the foot traffic they were hoping for during events like the convention, he said.\n\n\"I heard basically from 90 to 95% of them that the NAACP conference had no effect on our community, and it was designed for, as some put it, elite Boston,” George said. “And Nubian Square and Roxbury is not considered elite Boston.\"\n\nThe Boston NAACP did organize a tour of Nubian Square during the convention and met with members of the community during their planning process.\n\nBut branch President Tanisha Sullivan said that for too long, a lack of investment in Nubian Square hasn't positioned it to support something like a national convention.\n\n“I want to celebrate Nubian Square and every opportunity I get, I will do so,” Sullivan said. “At the same time we've got to do more to hold both governments and the private sector accountable for making reinvestment in that particular part of the city so that it has something more to offer to folks when they're coming to Boston.\"\n\nSo whether it’s public art recognizing a global civil rights figure or the convening of the oldest and largest civil rights organization in the U.S., how can the momentum spark a shift here?\n\nIt may already be happening in the form of redevelopment.\n\nPrivate developers with ties to the neighborhood say projects like the long-awaited Parcel 3 will help revitalize the area. It’s set to break ground in the coming years just outside of Nubian Square.\n\nIt's also expected to bring affordable housing, retail and cultural spaces, such as the center promised by Embrace Boston to accompany the new monument on the Common.\n\nExecutive Director Imari Paris Jeffries said there's also a monument coming to Nubian Square.\n\n\"We hope to break ground in 18 months, and then 30 months after that we should be opening our doors,” Paris Jeffries said. “So there will be another monument, and I think those two monuments will be in relationship to each other. We’re creating a pipeline. One thing leads to something bigger and better, and I think the Embrace Center has the potential to be bigger than The Embrace.\"\n\nThere's also the new memorial to Justice Edward O. Gourdin in Veterans Memorial Park that was unveiled in August.\n\nPlus Nubian Ascends, a pedestrian-focused development set to come to Washington Street, promises life science labs and a new cultural center. And there’s another mixed-use development coming to the area, where the Boston NAACP branch plans to relocate its office from its current home in Roxbury's Washington Park Mall.\n\nBut with new development comes concerns about gentrification for residents and businesses alike.\n\nThat’s something Roxbury native and Councilor Tania Fernandes Anderson is trying to safeguard against. She’s also pushing for more investment from the city in this neighborhood.\n\nShe said it will take a lot more than fancy buildings for things to change.\n\n\"As long as you can build a box for me and you put me in it and all I have to come out to is clean kitchens and work your restaurants, then that is not real economic mobility,” Fernandes Anderson said. “I would say then that you would support a housing ecosystem, so that I live a higher quality of life.”\n\nWe met at Nubian Markets, a café and grocery store that opened this year offering Halal and other culturally specific foods.\n\nThe councilor sees businesses like these as vital to Nubian Square’s future. And she has a message for newcomers.\n\n“I would just say to my fellow gentrifiers: Welcome to Boston, but please partake in the mom and pop shops,” she said. “Please go to the bodegas, please, please invest in the small business in our corridors.\"\n\nWith recent talks about bringing a Black Wall Street to Boston, sparked by Celtics player Jaylen Brown, some are pointing to Nubian Square as its obvious home — not just for its potential future, but because of the wealth in its past.\n\nIt’s one that Rufus J. Faulk said any economic revival here should honor, especially since the familiar hustle and bustle has faded away.\n\n\"There aren’t as many stores, isn't as much activity,” he said. “But I think, I feel like there's so much potential to sort of rebuild that. So we talk about the old and the new: How do we bring the sort of traditions that made Roxbury what it was, and sort of update them so now we can sort of expand upon it to make sure that it's like the culture hasn't died?”\n\nKeeping that culture alive here could be the key to having it all over the city.",

Yesterday, we took a walk down the block in Roxbury's Nubian Square to talk about how momentum from a big year for Boston's Black communities can carry over there. Momentum sparked by the unveiling of The Embrace Monument on Boston Common, the NAACP convention and other events. One person thinking about the economic potential for the area is Nicole Obi, president and CEO of the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts. The organization recently moved its offices into Nubian Square. I spoke with Nicole recently in light of the conversation we've been having about the area and asked her what sort of investment is needed in Nubian Square to realize the future so many say is possible there?\n\nNicole Obi: The investment that's needed is really focused on making sure that Nubian Square evolves into a place to live, work and play. There's so much pent up potential in this area. We've invested quite a bit in life sciences and some of the other growth industries in other parts of Boston. We still have untapped potential there in Nubian Square. There are 50,000-plus residents in the area who can help us to meet the workforce demand to really drive us to accomplishing our climate sustainability goals and to help to keep Massachusetts at the top in the nation and in the world. But if we don't effectively engage this really rich opportunity, we're undermining our abilities to really become the Massachusetts that we all want to be.\n\nAlston: So Nicole, there's been a lot of discussion lately about bringing a Black Wall Street to Boston. Of course, this has been sparked by Celtics player Jaylen Brown stating that he wants to do that here. And I know that you and Aisha Francis of Franklin Cummings Tech recently penned an op-ed in The Globe, essentially calling for that to be in Nubian Square. I'm curious, has BECMA been in contact with him about this at all?\n\nObi: No, we haven't been in touch with Jaylen Brown about this concept. He's been talking about this for a while and we've been talking about building Black wealth for a while, and we want to work with other community players in the space. So right there in Nubian Square, besides Roxbury Community College and Franklin Cummings Tech, there's the Urban League, there's Twelfth Baptist Church, there are many other organizations that are there to support the evolution of this neighborhood to become what we believe that it can be.\n\nAlston: So lastly, Nicole, in the story we did through this block walk we took through Nubian Square, we've illustrated how these big moments have taken place in other parts of the city. And now one of the questions is how do we channel that back into our Black communities, as you're describing. What do you think brings all of those things together, and how can we use that momentum to build the bridges that we are hoping can bridge the divides that currently exist throughout our city?\n\nObi: What brings it all together, as I said: There's so many assets that this area has to build upon, and what's really needed is intentionality and a will to make it happen. The Seaport not too long ago was diametrically different than what it is today. And it took a movement to make it happen. But in a very short period of time it was realized. And I would say that Nubian Square actually has a lot more assets and has a lot to build upon to make it be a really thriving part of the city of Boston, without having it lose what makes it special, which to us is the Black people and our culture. So we're excited about being part of that. And we welcome our politicians and others to help us make this happen.\n\nAlston: Well, that is Nicole Obi, president and CEO of the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts. Nicole, thank you so much.\n\nObi: Thank you.",

He said he did not believe any new investigations had been opened. He also contended that the NBC report had initially omitted the company disclosing concerns to the government in 2022, and that Block had “robust” controls for its Bitcoin offering.\n\n“We continuously improve our compliance program based on a number of different inputs including self-identified issues, audits, and guidance from our regulators,” Dorsey said during the call.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nOakland, California-based Block is being investigated by prosecutors from the Department of Justice’s Southern District of New York, according to the NBC news report on Wednesday.\n\nA former employee, armed with internal company documents, has been working with the prosecutors to detail issues such as Block allegedly processing Bitcoin transactions for terrorist groups, and the company’s Square unit processing transactions for countries subject to U.S. economic sanctions.\n\nThe company is also facing potential federal investigations concerning its compliance program from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, an agency in the U.S. Treasury Department, as well as with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, based on complaints from two whistleblowers, according to a February NBC report.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau notified Block in February that it may take “legal action” against the company, based on customer service concerns related to the company’s peer-to-peer payment unit Cash App.\n\nWall Street analysts who follow the publicly-traded company seemed largely unconcerned about the legal concerns facing the payments company. During the earnings call, none of the questions touched on the NBC report, the government investigations or legal concerns.\n\n“We imagine (Block’s) procedures would have tightened up since” earlier reports regarding similar allegations, Baird Senior Research Analyst David Koning wrote in a Wednesday note to clients.\n\nBlock’s first-quarter net income climbed to $472 million, jumping more than five-fold from $98 million for the year-earlier quarter, according to the company’s shareholder letter. Net revenue for the quarter rose 19% to $5.96 billion. Excluding bitcoin revenue, revenue increased 14% to $3.23 billion.",
      "# [Muchnik-Led Petition to Block Walden Square Development Nears 1,000 Signatures on 2024-04-19](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/4/19/walden-street-petition-housing/)\nOne of Cambridge’s most vociferous opponents of high-rise affordable housing is mounting a protest against a proposal to build an additional 95 affordable units in the 240-unit Walden Square Apartments.\n\nUnder the city’s Affordable Housing Overlay — a policy which loosens the process for building affordable housing in Cambridge — apartment developers WinnDevelopment are in the design review process to build the 95 units across two buildings of six and seven stories each.\n\nBut Cambridge filmmaker Frederico Muchnik said recently that his petition to block the construction is now nearing its goal of 1,000 signatures.\n\nMuchnik’s petition raises concerns that the “industrial, oversized slab-style housing” will jeopardize the “character of Cambridge,” advocating instead for lower affordable housing developments that match the local building style. Muchnik made preventing the Walden Square development the centerpiece of his failed run for the Cambridge City Council last year.\n\nIn an initial 2021 proposal, WinnDevelopment had plans to construct a nine-story building. But after Muchnik and other residents objected, WinnDevelopment revised the proposal into two smaller buildings of six and seven stories each.\n\nStill, Muchnik’s objections to the development have persisted for a number of reasons — including diverting pedestrian traffic onto narrow paths, environmental impacts, and over-densification of the neighborhood.\n\n“The underpass continues to be a vexing, poorly designed idea at the wrong location,” Muchnik said. “I want folks who make the city run, people who don’t have wealth, to live here.”\n\nMuchnik’s opposition flies in the face of what many housing advocates have said is the only solution to Cambridge’s worsening affordable housing crisis: to build more.\n\nRebecca M. “Becca” Schofield, co-chair of housing advocacy organization A Better Cambridge, stressed the importance of building vertically to increase Cambridge’s limited housing supply in an emailed statement.\n\n“We don’t have much undeveloped land area left, so we need to go vertical to create more units — which is how we meet housing demand in an equitable way,” she wrote. “Furthermore, going higher means open space can be better preserved — buildings can be narrower and taller in order to create open space for residents and the public without sacrificing unit count.”\n\nIn spite of extensive changes to WinnDevelopment’s original proposal to accommodate many of these complaints — including lowering the height of the development — Muchnik has been unwavering in his stance that the solution is to stop the development altogether.\n\nHis petition encourages WinnDevelopment to “build elsewhere.”\n\n“There’s no lack of possibilities for additional public housing. So from my perspective, these buildings feel wedged into already a prohibitively tight and dense space that will degrade the quality of life for the people there and lead to long term quality of life issues for Walden residents as well,” he said.\n\n“This is an opportunity that a private developer is taking to collect city, state, and federal funds in the name of public housing to develop property and own it and then reap the benefits to rental income over X number of years,” Muchnik added.\n\nSchofield wrote that Muchnik’s campaign was an example of perennial efforts from Cambridge residents which would limit the amount of affordable housing available to low-income households.\n\n“There will always be neighborhood opposition from folks who already have secure housing and like the way their neighborhood is — but this position is typically exclusionary and limits housing options for lower-income families who need it,” Schofield wrote.\n\nStill, Muchnik insisted that his position was not exclusionary, writing in a text message that the development itself would exclude low-income and immigrant residents living in the area who “have no say in this.”\n\nHis proposal, he said in an interview, “is not about reducing, tempering, or diminishing the amount of low-income people,” which he said will “continue to grow — development or no development — at Walden Square for reasons having to do with culture, focus on family.”\n\nEd Cafasso, a spokesperson for WinnDevelopment wrote in an email that many current residents of the Walden Square Apartments have expressed a desire to move into the new units once they become available. There are currently 1,128 families on the waitlist, according to the webpage for the development.\n\nSchofield, whose group has pushed for the development, said that despite Muchnik’s objections, any new affordable housing would be a boon.\n\n“Especially in a well-resourced, transit-oriented city like Cambridge, we will always advocate for the developments that create more housing options and make our city more welcoming to more people,” she added.\n\n—Staff writer Jade Lozada can be reached at jade.lozada@thecrimson.com.",
      "# [Block to shrink workforce by Caitlin Mullen on 2023-11-03](https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/block-job-cuts-layoffs-jack-dorsey-square-cash-app-afterpay-earnings/698730/)\nDive Brief:\n\nDigital payments company Block, parent to Square and Cash App, plans to shrink its workforce by about 8% over the next year, its executives said Thursday. The company, which had about 13,000 employees as of the end of the third quarter, will cap its headcount at 12,000, Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said.\n\n“We expect to be a smaller team by the end of 2024, compared to where we are today,” Ahuja told analysts during the company’s third-quarter earnings conference call.\n\nSan Francisco-based Block will take steps to reach the headcount goal throughout the year, including through performance management and centralizing teams and functions to decrease duplication, said Ahuja, who is also Block’s chief operating officer.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nBlock’s third-quarter loss nearly doubled to $29 million, compared to the year-earlier quarter, according to the company’s shareholder letter. Net revenue for the quarter rose 24%, to $5.62 billion. Excluding bitcoin revenue, revenue increased 16% to $3.19 billion.\n\nThe move to pare the company’s workforce — expanding on job cuts Block confirmed last month — was mentioned as part of an increased focus on profitability and efficiency. Earlier this year, Block pledged to focus investments on customer retention as it pursues profitable growth over the long term.\n\nIn a Friday note to investor clients, Bank of America Securities Analyst Jason Kupferberg referred to the employee cuts as a “~10% reduction” compared to the company’s headcount as of the end of the Q3.\n\nThe company also aims to shave costs in areas such as corporate overhead, real estate, travel and vendor relationships, Ahuja said Thursday. The company’s third-quarter operating expenses jumped 18% year over year, to $1.91 billion, according to its quarterly shareholder letter.\n\n“We may incur expenses, including restructuring costs, in the short term to implement these initiatives, but we expect to benefit from these actions in future periods,” Block said in its quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nDuring Thursday’s call with analysts, Block Head Jack Dorsey laid out his priorities at merchant business Square, which he took the helm of last month following the departure of Square CEO Alyssa Henry. Those include doubling down on Square’s platform and its features, using artificial intelligence more effectively and taking a more local approach, such as with sales.\n\n“My first two weeks running Square was focused on, what are we working on and why?” Dorsey said. “To be very frank, I believe we were getting in our own way throughout the company,” Dorsey said. Since taking the helm of Square, Dorsey said he’s noticed “a lot of silos, a lot of redundancy, a lack of desire for teams to work together.”\n\nHe also discovered “unclear decision-making throughout the company, which led to a lot of slowness, especially on the Square side,” Dorsey said. Also under the Block umbrella are peer-to-peer payments business Cash App and Australian buy now, pay later provider Afterpay.\n\nIn the past, Square “has been hampered” by not taking more novel approaches to sales that its competitors have employed, Dorsey noted. The business is removing those constraints to learn more quickly and invest in proven approaches, he said.\n\nMuch of what’s holding Square back is its onboarding process, he mentioned. The business still obtains a significant chunk of seller customers through self-serve channels, whether that’s buying hardware on Square’s website or through e-commerce site Amazon, and Square’s onboarding flow for those merchants “just takes way too much time,” he said.\n\nIn seeking to improve that, Dorsey pledged “pretty quick results over the next year.”\n\nDorsey said he plans to lead Square until the business unit has made a “significant return to growth” and becomes more innovative and inventive. Square’s gross payment volume rose 11% for the third quarter, to $55.7 billion, the shareholder letter said. The share of Square clients that it considers its large merchants edged up one percentage point over the prior quarter, to 41% of its overall client base.\n\n“I’ll know when it’s time and when Square’s set up in a way that we look to find a dedicated lead,” he said. “But this move has enabled me to see a lot of the problems, not just within Square but across the company, and work to fix them very quickly.”",

The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality has issued an ozone alert for Friday, for the Tulsa metropolitan area. An ozone alert means that conditions are favorable for the buildup of ozone near the ground, to an unhealthy level. When winds are light, the vapors from fuels such as gasoline, exhaust from engines, and air pollutants from industrial activities remain trapped near the ground. If sunshine is abundant when these air pollutants build up, a chemical process is triggered that results in the development of ozone near the ground during the afternoon and evening hours.
