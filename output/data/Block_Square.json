The company is headquartered in San Francisco, California, and is recognized for its focus on financial services and economic empowerment. Block operates several platforms, including Square, Cash App, TIDAL, TBD, and Spiral, each catering to different aspects of financial transactions and services [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/square).\n\nBlock's primary product, Square, is a comprehensive point-of-sale system that allows businesses to accept card payments and manage various business operations. Other significant products include Cash App, a mobile payment service; TIDAL, a music streaming service; TBD, a decentralized finance platform; and Spiral, a project aimed at advancing Bitcoin adoption [(Wikimedia, 2010-05-14)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\nThe company serves a diverse customer base, including individual users, small businesses, and larger enterprises, making it a B2B and B2C company. Block generates revenue through transaction fees, subscription services, and sales of hardware products. As of 2023, Block serves approximately 56 million users and 4 million sellers, processing $228 billion in payments annually [(Wikimedia, 2010-05-14)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\nBlock has undergone significant changes over time, including rebranding from Square to Block to reflect its broader range of services. The company has also expanded its product offerings through acquisitions, such as Afterpay and TIDAL, to enhance its financial services ecosystem [(Wikimedia, 2010-05-14)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Jack Dorsey**: Co-founder and current CEO of Block, Inc. Dorsey is a well-known figure in the tech industry, having also co-founded Twitter. He is set to take on the additional role of \"Square Head\" following the departure of Alyssa Henry [(Wikimedia, 2010-05-14)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n- **Alyssa Henry**: Former CEO of Square, who is leaving the company in October 2023. Her departure marks a significant leadership change that may impact the strategic direction of Square [(Wikimedia, 2010-05-14)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n# News\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Acquisitions and Partnerships\n\n- In January 2022, Block completed its acquisition of Afterpay for $29 billion, enhancing its offerings in the buy now, pay later space [(Wikimedia, 2010-05-14)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n- Block acquired a majority stake in TIDAL in March 2021 for $297 million, aiming to provide artists with better tools to manage their careers [(Wikimedia, 2010-05-14)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n### Financial Performance\n\nBlock reported a gross payment volume of $228 billion and an annual income of $9.8 million for 2023. However, the company has experienced financial fluctuations, with a trailing 12-month revenue of $20.79 billion and a net income of -$282.12 million as of February 2024 [(Reiff, Investopedia, 2021-01-07)](https://www.investopedia.com/square-top-shareholders-5094562).\n\n### Leadership Changes\n\nAlyssa Henry's departure as CEO of Square in October 2023 will see Jack Dorsey taking on additional responsibilities, which may influence the company's strategic direction [(Wikimedia, 2010-05-14)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n## Opinions and Market Sentiment\n\nBlock's stock has experienced significant volatility, with shares losing over 80% of their value from their peak in 2021. Despite this, analysts remain optimistic about the company's potential for recovery, particularly under Dorsey's leadership. The stock is considered undervalued compared to its peers, with a consensus rating of \"Strong Buy\" based on 23 Buys, four Holds, and one Sell rating [(Sheth, Tipranks, 2025-01-10)](https://www.tipranks.com/news/block-changes-ticker-to-xyz-to-give-a-holistic-business-appeal).\n\n### Controversies\n\nBlock has faced scrutiny from Hindenburg Research, which accused the company of exaggerating user counts and failing to curb fraud on Cash App. Block has stated its intention to cooperate with the SEC regarding these allegations [(Wikimedia, 2010-05-14)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.).\n\n## Future Outlook\n\nBlock is set to change its ticker symbol from \"SQ\" to \"XYZ\" on January 21, 2025, as part of its rebranding efforts. Analysts expect that continued innovation in product offerings and international expansion will drive growth in the coming years [(Davis, Tipranks, 2025-01-10)](https://www.tipranks.com/news/block-changes-ticker-to-xyz-to-give-a-holistic-business-appeal).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBlock, Inc. is a key player in the fintech industry, with a strong product offering in Square and a growing ecosystem that includes Cash App, Afterpay, and TIDAL. Despite facing challenges, including leadership changes and scrutiny over its practices, the company is well-positioned for future growth, particularly as it continues to innovate and expand its services.

You can use volume detection, the dx dy dz trio. After that you need to perform a relative teleport on the player to move them to the correct position.

      "# Post ID tbthjj: [PSA] Newer TP-Link Routers send ALL your web traffic to 3rd party servers... with +2025 score by [(ArmoredCavalry, Reddit, 2022-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/tbthjj/psa_newer_tplink_routers_send_all_your_web/)\nI recently enabled a DNS gateway to be able to see requests from my router, and network devices. Was surprised to find 80K + requests (in 24 hours) out to an Avira \"Safe Things\" subdomains `*.safethings.avira.com` (far more than any other server).\n\nDigging into this more, I found that it is related to the built-in router security \"Home Shield\" that ships with newer TP-Link routers - [https://oem.avira.com/en/solutions/safethings-for-router-manufacturers](https://oem.avira.com/en/solutions/safethings-for-router-manufacturers)\n\nHere is the kicker though, I have the Avira / Home Shield services completely turned off (I wasn't even subscribed to their paid service for it). The router doesn't care, and sends ALL your traffic to be \"analyzed\" anyhow. See this response from TP Link (towards bottom of review) from last year - [https://www.xda-developers.com/tp-link-deco-x68-review/#:\\~:text=TP%2DLink%20says%20the%20network%20activity](https://www.xda-developers.com/tp-link-deco-x68-review/#:~:text=TP%2DLink%20says%20the%20network%20activity) Update: I emailed reviewer to confirm TP-Link never updated him after.\n\nI contacted support about this again, and was given a non-answer about how the requests are to check subscription status. 80K + requests a day to check subscription status? Why would it even need to do 1 single subscription check, if I'm not enabling any functionality that is behind a subscription paywall? Also the rate of requests is not constant, it is higher when my internet traffic is higher. To me this lack of consistent answer / response from TP-Link is as concerning as the requests themselves.\n\nI'm not seeing much online about this issue, as I don't think many people realize it is even occurring (since traffic is outgoing straight from router, as opposed to an individual computer). Hoping to gain some attention on this issue and get a real answer / response from TP-Link about what exactly is going on here. As well as a **concrete timeline** and promise for a fix to stop these outgoing requests, when we aren't even using their anti-virus services.\n\nEdit: Additional details, this is on their WiFI 6 AX3000 (Archer AX55) Router. From the XDA Review looks like this is also happening on their Deco series. If you want to easily check your own router, you can use any DNS Gateway ([NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/), [Cloudflare Gateway](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/gateway/) Pi-Hole etc.) Just be sure to set the DNS servers under \"Advanced->Network->Internet->Advanced Settings\" because the DHCP DNS server setting will only apply to the devices inside the network, not the router itself.\n\nEdit #2: I've also contacted Avira directly regarding the endpoints, in the hope that they'll be more straightforward than TP-Link about the purpose. Will update here when I receive a response. Update: Avira support got back to me and said they couldn't answer any questions because I'm not a paying customer. So they can collect data, for free, but not tell me what the data is...\n\nEdit #3: If anyone knows of good industry contacts, who can dig into this more or get real answers, please send a message! I've seen GamerNexus brought up a few times, but don't see any contact method.\n\n# Update: Temporary Fix!\n\nDiscovered this late, but in case someone gets here from Google, etc. I noticed that if I block the `*.safethings.avira.com` subdomains, then **reboot the router**, this seems to prevent it going into the retry-loops when DNS lookup fails. There must be a flag that is set in-memory if the first time the router is ever able to successfully contact the domains? Rebooting after blocking prevents this flag ever getting set. So without the retries involved, this hugely reduced the router CPU usage when blocking for me. The router is actually now attempting requests less than when not blocked at all.\n\n# Beta Firmware Update\n\nTP-Link has posted links to beta firmware that claims to fix the issue. Note:  It hasn't been verified whether the update actually reduces requests to Avira, or simply caches the DNS query (then makes requests directly to IP) - [https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/3329/](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/3329/)\n\n# Press Release by TP-Link Korea\n\nThanks to /u/Lord_Buffum for sharing this - [https://www.tp-link.com/kr/press/news/19964/](https://www.tp-link.com/kr/press/news/19964/)\n\nEssentially they say that the *frequency* (not existence) of DNS requests is a bug that will be fixed, but never explain  **WHY** the router needs to contact Avira with HomeShield disabled. To me this adds almost no reassurance or new info. We already knew Avira is used for HomeShield, and that DNS lookups to Avira are to get the IP address. What we don't know is 1) Why the requests are being made with the service disabled, and 2) What data is even being sent in the requests (and why). Translated relevant bits below -\n\n1. TP-Link HomeShield uses AVIRA services to protect its customers' networks from cybersecurity threats. AVIRA is a global cybersecurity software company based in Germany, now a brand of the Norton LifeLock group ([www.avira.com](http://www.avira.com)).\n\n>Because this service operates by accessing the AVIRA Cloud service, the router periodically checks the AVIRA Cloud IP address. The router sent a DNS query to check this IP address. In order for the router to continue to use AVIRA cloud services, ***it is necessary to periodically send DNS queries as it must be able to access AVIRA's IP***.  \n>  \n>However, as a result of examining the software, we found a defect in the DNS request logic where requests occur frequently, and our TP-Link has optimized the software to reduce such frequent queries. Customers will be able to update the firmware of these products soon.  \n>  \n>2. DNS query is to query a domain name, and send a DNS request to request the domain name of the AVIRA server.  \n>  \n>As a DNS query, no personal information is included in these requests.\n\n## Comment ID i097j3i with +256 score by [(ArmoredCavalry, Reddit, 2022-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/tbthjj/psa_newer_tplink_routers_send_all_your_web/i097j3i/) (in reply to ID tbthjj):\nI also have tried blocking / redirecting the DNS queries, but this results in the router getting stuck in retry loop (thousands of requests a minute), and a big spike in router CPU usage as a side effect.

Just thinking about this makes me feel really bad and angry.\n\nBut then I'm used to ISPs routing all traffic to specific city hundreds of kilometers away as the \"gateway to the world\" so that the traffic can come back to city near me... Remote connecting to PC 10 km apart results in 100 ms of delay. Plus they scan all your requests and warn you when you try to open website that they think is malicious. Add the constant telemetry from everything including Windows, antiviruses etc and the TP-Link issue doesn't seem that outrageous...\n\nAt this point I think we NEED a law that forces companies to let you easily turn off ALL the traffic that is not essential to the device/app to work correctly.

Or when I open Google Maps and it automatically opens the city they think I'm in - which is the city the traffic is routed to by ISP before going into internet.

Broadcom's chips are probably the most popular choice for consumer routers, but they're very not open-source friendly so getting the WiFi working on OpenWRT tends to be difficult or impossible.

You probably should look into stepping up your game into actual small business/prosumer wireless gear.

I'm a fan of Unifi's in-wall aps. https://store.ui.com/products/unifi-in-wall-hd. You can probably figure out a nice clean mounting solution with your current ethernet jacks in each room. You'd just trunk your vlans to the APs, and in the wireless controller set your SSIDs to use <x> tag for each network. Use PFSense to filter intervlan traffic and do the actual routing. If you have wired backhaul everywhere, might as well have good wifi coverage all throughout the house. \n\nYou can always just do baby steps.

I also agree, there's nothing in my analysis that proves that all the requests are related to network traffic.\n\nHowever, if you look at the wording of the reply (directly from TP-Link) to XDA in their review, I don't see how it could be interpreted any other way?

Muggles, and even a lot of tech saavy folks, never even think to check their router DNS settings. Also +1 for mentioning [nextdns.io](https://nextdns.io) A subscription to that is one of the best $20/yr you can spend. I'm in my 3rd year with nextdns and there have been many times it blocked something that uBlock origin and whatever PC security suite I use have missed.\n\nA couple of years ago, I bought a [cheap $35 router](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075V12B48/) from Amazon. As I was going thru the settings when I first got it (as I do with literally every electronic device I get - review every single setting of every single settings page), I noticed it had an IP address pre-programmed for the WAN DNS. I first set it to DHCP and then rebooted the router, only to find that IP was back in the WAN DNS after reboot. [pingtool.org](https://pingtool.org) revealed the IP is located in China. Next, I set the WAN DNS to [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) instead of the pre-programmed IP, rebooted and it saved the [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) setting after reboot. At least 190 other people bought the router, and it irks me that nearly all of them probably have no idea all their DNS requests are being routed thru China.\n\n### Comment ID i0cmpzd with +4 score by [(DarkWorld25, Reddit, 2022-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/tbthjj/psa_newer_tplink_routers_send_all_your_web/i0cmpzd/) (in reply to ID i0asb8o):\nLmao the manufacturer probably didn't expect that the product would even be exported.

However, I like nextdns.io subscription for the analytics/reporting and the fine tune control it has. The next best thing would be a pi-hole; but with nextdns.io, you can use it both at home and on the go.

It correlates up / down depending on internet traffic. I'll add to this main post.\n\nI have two TP-Link routersP\n\nArcher C4000\n\nArcher AX4400\n\nThe C4000 is retired due to lack of firmware updates.  Got the AX4400 as my first WiFi 6 router.  It's a slightly slower version of the AX73.  The last firmware update was July 11, 2022.  As far as stability, I like TP-Link routers, my main concern was lack of firmware updates.  I replaced the AX4400 with an Asus RT-AX86U, but even as someone who's good with computers, and tech, and has some formal training, the Asus still feels overwhelming with all it's features.  So, I have kept the AX4400 (with updated firmware) as a backup in case I want to go back to a more simple setup.  Also I own a 6th Gen Airport Extreme router, and after doing some research on those, I found from various reports in the Macrumors forums that, they are still secure today, but the main hangup is because they are older hardware, their speed isn't up to modern ISP plans.  (especially over wireless) since it's a first gen WiFi 5 device.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I have two routers as alternatives.  I was also told by people on the smallnetbuilder forums that That I'd probably be more secure with my TP-Link router as Asus is targeted more in attacks.

Pick model A, model B. \n2. Choose the first 'master' preset that has the type of merge you imagine, e.g. \"Structure A, Detail B\" or \"Structure A, Style B\" or \"Roughly 50/50\", etc. \n3. Generate a stack of images using a prompt file and choose one master preset to proceed with.\n4. Scroll down in the list to the 'subtle' versions of that master preset, which has small changes. The variations are many because there are many possibilities:\n   1. general strength of model a/b +/- \n   2. structure / detail from model a/b +/- effectively moving the pattern by layer offset up, +/-1 layer\n   3. large structure / detail / style by 1st order asymmetry +/- across in/out\n   4. subtle structure / detail / style by 2nd order asymmetry +/- across in, across out, or both.\n5. Upload it to civitai as a new version of your model :-D\n\nAnyway, here's a softer version of the structure / detail presets. Similar to gradV and gradA but based on cosine, then scaling them to 0.25, 0.5 for a gentler effect.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jjrqy2s2qj3c1.png?width=955&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f61b03e1ed9b8fa9660b5f6b882b7854b899732\n\n### Comment ID kbgmkfr with +2 score by [(Luke2642, Reddit, 2023-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kbgmkfr/) (in reply to ID kbgb3ws):\nthere's gotta be a better way to name the master merge weight types?\n\ndoes anyone have any ideas or suggestions?\n\ncould be based on the maths, the symmetry, or their effect?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0s50c1z1k3c1.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=7969f484d157e8651227efdffd64609e6e339ae2\n\n#### Comment ID kbi4oyv with +1 score by [(mikebrave, Reddit, 2023-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kbi4oyv/) (in reply to ID kbgmkfr):\nI struggle with memorizing names of things so some sort of nickname, mathname, and description of effect would probably be the ideal pairing for me.\n\nit would look something like this (example is wrong because I'm ignorant, but it's a placeholder):\n\nBayesian, \"start here\", -smoothly blends between style and substance\n\n## Comment ID kbevanw with +4 score by [(Luke2642, Reddit, 2023-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kbevanw/) (in reply to ID 187kuzi):\nI'm looking for suggestions, tips & tricks regarding block merging of the U-Net.\n\nThe table image above shows the various presets available in many block merge tools, but, it is far from being comprehensive.\n\nWhat presets would you like to see?\n\nWhat workflow do you do when merging that you think is unique or powerful?\n\nDo you use add difference or something else to get cool results?\n\nI've generally found:\n\n1. GradV/GradA, Cosine/Reverse Cosine are more useful than all the rest of the presets. Occasionally the hermite - roughly 50/50 with a swish up or down at the start/end are useful.\n2. Often, the presets are too strong on their own. When they're too strong, they need scaling down, to make, for example, 'GradV mild' which starts at 0.5 and drops to 0.\n3. Often, the presets are too weak on their own, and need shifting up or down. A bit like combining WRAP with GradV or Cosine, so it rises to 1 then stays at 1 for the last 5 layers.\n4. Symmetry works well - if you include some weight in e.g OUT8, include some weight in IN3 and it seems to get stronger / more coherent, I guess due to skips.\n5. Smooth bumps work better than adjusting a group of layers to 1 or 0. WRAP/RING etc all need tapering to get coherent merges.\n6. Smoothstep variants are all confusing and don't seem to be particularly useful. If they had more memorable names and some were more symetrical, perhaps they'd be better?\n7. Ideally there would be a visual output, or a spline that you could drag up and down.\n\n### Comment ID kbfbr9d with +1 score by [(ShatalinArt, Reddit, 2023-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kbfbr9d/) (in reply to ID kbevanw):\nTo get a 0.5 merge effect, I use a trick like this.\n\nModel A merge Model B = Model C\n\nI usually use Cosine/Reverse Cosine\n\nThen:\n\nModel A merge Mode C = Model D\n\nModel D - will get a merge effect of about 0.5-0.6\n\n#### Comment ID kbfe4wu with +1 score by [(Luke2642, Reddit, 2023-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kbfe4wu/) (in reply to ID kbfbr9d):\nInteresting, thanks!\n\nSo if I understand, you like cosine/reverse cosine, but you find they're too strong.

Green should be 50/50.\n\nDeeper layers do seem to control the structure, while the outer layers control the details. The topmost layers seem particularly sensitive though, as I guess they get the signal directly from the text encoder?\n\nThere's also a lot of merging choice in doing it symmetrically or asymmetrically. The style of A but the structure of B, etc, across in and out.\n\nBut, as you say, it really is a bit of an art, in that you have to experiment and just see which weights mix works the best, getting the brush strokes of A, or the realism of B, etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m7aim6gjfi3c1.png?width=1571&format=png&auto=webp&s=48dd064785adf2017859fececdb4dcb0271e8390\n\n#### Comment ID kbf5bh6 with +3 score by [(Luke2642, Reddit, 2023-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kbf5bh6/) (in reply to ID kbf3tgm):\nNow green is 0.5 :-D\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/id7e1958hi3c1.png?width=1599&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e0a8667bcea092c22d1f3cd3ca2325609b660cb\n\n### Comment ID kbf4zol with +3 score by [(Luke2642, Reddit, 2023-11-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kbf4zol/) (in reply to ID kbeyg11):\nAww man I wrote a reply and it somehow got lost in the tubes.

Use runtime merge block weights and play with the sliders.\n\nPut a prompt in, set batch to 4 of 512x512 so you can iterate quickly. Fix the seed. Generate the same batch for two different models, two models that look very different, perhaps a cartoon and a photo real.\n\nHowever, you'll also notice the structure changes, the composition of each image in the batch will be different between the two models. Arms legs pose framing etc.\n\nSo, with the seed fixed, set A as cartoon and B as photo real, and slowly increase one slider at a time until you have a model that generates the composition of the original cartoon batch but looks photo real.\n\nWork your way down top to bottom on both sides at once, because the skip connections are really important. That's why FreeU has such a big impact.\n\nYou'll probably notice that the highest 1-5 layers can often be set 50-100% and the lowest 1-3 layers can be set quite high, something like 25% to 50%, but that somewhere in the lower half and middle, it'll be really sensitive for 3-4 layers on both the input and output. Raising those sliders suddenly gives B composition not A. You've identified \"structure\" versus \"detail\" for that pair of models, for that 1 prompt.\n\nIt can vary quite a bit across different prompts, depending on what each model was trained on, similar or different.\n\nFor most of the cartoon versus photoreal models you'll see a kind of approximate hour glass shape on both sides, but it varies enormously with spikes.\n\nYou can then save out that model, and then make softer mixes. Use it with a gradA, gradV, cosine, rev cosine, or flat strength mix with either of the original models to tone it up or down. \n\nHappy merging!\n\n## Comment ID kc3ubqy with +1 score by [(HarmonicDiffusion, Reddit, 2023-12-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kc3ubqy/) (in reply to ID 187kuzi):\nThank you for providing your research here, it has definitely made me think about some things in a new light!\n\n### Comment ID kc42l0m with +3 score by [(Luke2642, Reddit, 2023-12-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/kc42l0m/) (in reply to ID kc3ubqy):\nNo problem, hope it is helpful! :-)\n\nAnother thing that helped improve my intuition was the slow process of trying to merge two checkpoints together, using the goal of \"the maximum amount of model 2 without changing X from model 1\"... testing using a batch of a few 512x512 seeds.\n\nX can be structure, colours, style, etc\n\nIt takes about 20 minutes of moving the sliders one at a time, generating and checking, one by one, up to 50%, then if that works, to 75%, but if it messes up the composition, down to 25%, then move on to the next slider.\n\nOnce you're done, if you merge the result in with model 2 at a low strength, like 20%, strength, you'll still get some of X from model 1 in a nice version of model 2 that hasn't been screwed up by a strong merge.\n\nThe thing I haven't figured out yet is how to use add difference more effectively. It's great for adding inpainting to a model but it mostly just screws up models even at low weights, even if you do know what model it was trained from, and use low weights. I'm sure there's more potential there.\n\n#### Comment ID ktiq004 with +1 score by [(HarmonicDiffusion, Reddit, 2024-03-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/187kuzi/merge_block_weights_do_you_have_ideas_suggestions/ktiq004/) (in reply to ID kc42l0m):\nwould love to hear anything new you have discovered!  do you have a discord, blog, etc?",

FromSoftware is like Black Sabbath. Black Sabbath took a lot of elements from here and there and turned it into something that had never been done before.

Just like FromSoft games felt like nothing you had ever played before.   \n  \nBands came along and took a lot of influence from Sabbath over the years.  Judas Priest, Motorhead, Metallica, Pantera, Slipknot, At The Gates, Korn, System of a Down, Gojira, Mastodon....the list goes on. Many of those bands sound very little like each other. But they are all, undeniably, metal bands.\n\nBlack Myth Wukong is a soulslike. And there is nothing wrong with that.

The Heavy Attacks in the Game work differently from other games.\n\nIn most normal actions you'll be mixing light and heavy attacks into every combo.\n\nIn Black Myth, Heavy Attacks requires Attacking Enemies with Light attack/ Perfect Dodges/ Deflecting Projectiles to earn 'Combo Points' which you can spend on Heavy Attacks. These moves also usually does big damage and staggers the Enemy/Boss.

      "# Post ID 1bcntlv: Beacon range clarification with +4 score by [(Z010X, Reddit, 2024-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalminecraft/comments/1bcntlv/beacon_range_clarification/)\nMy understanding is the full power beacon is 50 blocks from the center that creates a square perimeter. My other understanding is that is within the Simulation 4 distance ie 50 < 64. My question is does that mean a sim distance of 4 DIAGNOALLY shuts off the beacon effects? \n\nI put the beacon down at 498, -54, 498. I aligned my base NW corner at 512,64,512. I noticed at 448, 71, 448 I have no effects which is within the distance of the square for a max beacon. Strangely if I goto 480, 71, 448 that works. 464, 71, 448 works too. I then checked 448, 71, 464 and that worked too.\n\nWhat is the issue with 448, 71, 448 not working? I literally have scaffolded a map with 16x16 deep slate lines to check this math (why can't we get an F3 debug on mobile?!)  \n\n## Comment ID kuh8oxs with +4 score by [(Willing_Ad_1484, Reddit, 2024-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalminecraft/comments/1bcntlv/beacon_range_clarification/kuh8oxs/) (in reply to ID 1bcntlv):\nIt does, it sucks, it's dumb. \n\nI had a friend go stand near a beacon for me and them getting close enough to load it gave me the effects too\n\n## Comment ID kuhasdy with +4 score by [(jerri_pi, Reddit, 2024-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalminecraft/comments/1bcntlv/beacon_range_clarification/kuhasdy/) (in reply to ID 1bcntlv):\nUnfortunately this simulation distance will indeed shut off the Beacon effect.\n\nThe simulation distance is a SPHERE centered on your player (foot level afaik) of 64 blocks, while the Beacon range is a SQUARE of 50 blocks from the Beacon.\n\nStanding at the corner 50 blocks in both the X and Z directions from the Beacon (putting you at the last block that should be within Beacon range) you are a distance of 70.7 blocks from the Beacon since the diagonal distance = &radic; ( 50^2 + 50^2 ) , which is greater than the simulation distance of 64.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: math symbols\n\nEdit 2: Simulation distance is a truncated diamond centered on the chunk you are standing in as others have pointed out\n\n### Comment ID kuhhc6z with +3 score by [(Z010X, Reddit, 2024-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalminecraft/comments/1bcntlv/beacon_range_clarification/kuhhc6z/) (in reply to ID kuhasdy):\nThank you for the concise answer.

The outlined chunks (red and blue) are the chunks where the beacon is close enough to have an effect in simulation distance 4. Oddly, it seems that it uses a (taxicab) radius of 5 chunks to determine this, rather than 4 as expected. You can see your test points in the Northwest corner, with black for (448, 448) and green for the two test points that worked.\n\nedit: TIL that sim 4 is actually a *truncated* diamond. I always though it was 4 chunks in taxicab metric away from the center, but it's actually 5 chunks away except for the fifth chunk in each cardinal direction. Now I need to check higher sim distances too.\n\n### Comment ID kuhxfzu with +2 score by [(TriangularHexagon, Reddit, 2024-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalminecraft/comments/1bcntlv/beacon_range_clarification/kuhxfzu/) (in reply to ID kuhfzc0):\nit's the same process for higher simulation distances.  for sim distance n, the range of chunks is n+1 taxicab distance, with the very tips truncated\n\n#### Comment ID kuhxq4u with +1 score by [(PinpricksRS, Reddit, 2024-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalminecraft/comments/1bcntlv/beacon_range_clarification/kuhxq4u/) (in reply to ID kuhxfzu):\nThanks!

That way it minimizes damage outside of that radius.\n\nIm still new myself and trying to shove my puzzle piece where it might fit lol.

Leadership at all levels should embody the qualities that attract and retain top talent.\n\t•\tEnsure that hiring managers are well-versed in company culture and values. Leaders need to not only understand these principles but also actively model and communicate them.\n\t•\tFoster a culture where employees and candidates feel heard, respected, and valued—this starts with clear communication, mutual respect, and accountability.\n\t•\tCreate structures to encourage and embrace innovation, ensuring employees feel comfortable sharing new ideas without fear of them being dismissed.\n\nFinal Thought:\nSquare and Block have immense potential to lead by example in the fintech industry, and their mission is worth believing in. With its strong foundation, Square has the opportunity to not only excel in financial technology but also set the standard for inclusive, value-driven workplaces. With stronger alignment in leadership, a renewed focus on respect and innovation, and hiring managers who embody these principles, the company could create an even more impactful and inspiring environment for its teams and candidates.",

This lack of openness diminished trust in the process.\n\t•\tInnovation: Suggestions for thinking outside the box during a role-play exercise were dismissed outright, which seemed contradictory to Block’s emphasis on creativity.\n\t•\tKnowledge Gaps: One of the interviewers did not know how to answer when asked how they foster a positive company culture. This is a red flag, as fostering culture is fundamental to a company’s leadership and values.",

Anything more than that, we need a partner to come in to save the day because we can't do our job\n3. Leadership within the org is a \"boys\" club. They all started around the same time and climbed their way to the top. Now, no one is held accountable because they all protect each other. There should have been some significant changes to certain leadership teams (BDR leaders for example) a while ago but instead they shifted the blame to our US Head of Sales and let them go. \n4. Speaking of BDR, they continue to over hire and underdeliver. They think the answer to their problem is to keep hiring people and firing them when they don't hit quota after 3 months. Apparently the org has a goal of closing a certain amount of GPV and we're extremely behind. So instead of focusing on the current reps, they think the easy way out is to keep hiring to get closer to that number.\n5. The product has become incredibly hard to sell. I'm not sure if it's because we are in an election year but this has been the worst year for Square sales.\n6. Leadership continues to say that they are listening to feedback yet it feels like it goes through one ear and comes out the other.",

You still have people who won’t give feedback, are not great at communication, and don’t fully see the value of their assistant. Block did one of the best jobs of managing this, and for the majority of the time we were seen as a significant part of company.\n\nUnfortunately, the head of the EO team has never been an EA herself and relies on the information given to her by her direct leads. These leads were like toxic high school students, they fought with each other, they use their own directs against each other, they blocked promotions, they over shared information that they should not have shared, and there was even an instance where one of them tried to get the other one fired for sharing privy information that she herself had shared with many people. Favoritism, bullying, and promoting people that didn’t deserve to get promoted were all prevalent. It made it very hard to work in collaboration across BUs and so much time and energy was wasted on petty drama. There was zero management training for most managers, and many were not good at feedback or managing their own emotions which spilled out into their directs. \n\nWith the RIF the EO team was gutted, and the change to titles and scope was unreal. There was so much upset but the leads refused feedback, and we were told in a meeting that we had “a choice to work here, so get over it”. The management team left are either in shock, or not very good but they are there through favoritism. Some of the managers who are still there are either compliant to the toxic approach and gossip, or on one lead’s good side, and are too scared to go against her. The few promotions we saw were friends with her and it was so obvious what was going on.\n\n I loved this job, or I thought I did, until this year when the toxicity got to be too much, and it’s so deep in leadership.",

There is a lot of change still settling there. It could turn out well now that there seems to be a bit more intentional corporate structure, but if you are interested in working there, really interview your hiring manager critically. I still believe strongly in the core product offering and wish them success, but it came with A LOT of extra headaches that were not worth it for me. I love solving hard product problems, but when you don't have the support of the organization and your own management to actually achieve that, it was time for me to go.",

The true test of character (for both people and companies) is when things get difficult.\n\nBlock talks a big game about economic empowerment and valuing its people. But their 2023 layoffs demonstrate that their rhetoric has become threadbare. When they are done with you they don’t hesitate to discard you with little to show for it. \n\nLayoffs are a fact of life. But decent companies treat their people decently, even when those people are on the way out. \n\nYes, the odds of you getting laid off are slim. But Block’s recent stingy exit packages are not consistent with their past. It is indicative of a cultural shift away from valuing people.\n\nHere is a table of the relative size of exit packages compared to the company’s size (a measure of the depth of their finances). The data are normalized so Block = 100%.\n\nBlock, Market cap = 100%, Exit package = 100% \nStripe, Market cap =125%, Exit package = 375% \nDoorDash, Market cap = 63%, Exit package = 288%\nPlaid, Market cap = 34%, Exit package = 325%\nLyft, Market cap = 10%, Exit package = 325%\nCoursera, Market cap = 5%, Exit package = 341%\n\n“Exit package” includes the notification period (period where you are no longer working but still on the payroll), any stock vested or bonus paid after notification of layoff, and severance.\n\nNaturally, Block’s package also pales in comparison to those of larger companies. Salesforce's severance was 6x Block's, Alphabet's was more than 4x, and Meta's was 3.5x Block's exit package.",

Management does nothing to address this, and in some cases, they even encourage it.\nPoor Leadership: Leadership lacks vision, communication, and empathy. They are more interested in playing office politics than in leading the team effectively. Feedback is often ignored or met with hostility.\nHigh Turnover: The company has an extremely high turnover rate, which speaks volumes about the underlying issues. Employees often leave within a year, leading to a lack of continuity and constant training of new hires.\nWork-Life Imbalance: Despite claims of supporting work-life balance, the reality is that you're expected to be available 24/7. Burnout is common, and there's little regard for personal time.\nLack of Growth Opportunities: There is little to no room for growth or career development. Promotions are rare and seem to be based on favoritism rather than merit.",

After the team favorites were promoted the promo rules magically changed. Now you need a \"business need\" for your promotion so you're essentially stuck in your level unless you switch roles or your exec is promoted; I supported some of the worst execs in my EA career at Block, Inc. which is crazy because Block has great people but some of the senior leaders (across the company) aren't so great and are instead super problematic with poor internal reputations. Before the layoffs, politics in the EO department was insane. Some leads give a lot of lip service and will act like they support you and are \"there\" for you but actually aren't. Some leads literally don't respect confidentiality and run their mouths like teenagers in high school.",

Speaking of BDR, they continue to over hire and underdeliver. They think the answer to their problem is to keep hiring people and firing them when they don't hit quota after 3 months. Apparently the org has a goal of closing a certain amount of GPV and we're extremely behind. So instead of focusing on the current reps, they think the easy way out is to keep hiring to get closer to that number.\n5. The product has become incredibly hard to sell.

Favoritism, bullying, and promoting people that didn’t deserve to get promoted were all prevalent.

Employees often leave within a year, leading to a lack of continuity and constant training of new hires.\nWork-Life Imbalance: Despite claims of supporting work-life balance, the reality is that you're expected to be available 24/7.

Leadership at all levels should embody the qualities that attract and retain top talent.\n\t•\tEnsure that hiring managers are well-versed in company culture and values. Leaders need to not only understand these principles but also actively model and communicate them.\n\t•\tFoster a culture where employees and candidates feel heard, respected, and valued—this starts with clear communication, mutual respect, and accountability.\n\t•\tCreate structures to encourage and embrace innovation, ensuring employees feel comfortable sharing new ideas without fear of them being dismissed.\n\nFinal Thought:\nSquare and Block have immense potential to lead by example in the fintech industry, and their mission is worth believing in. With its strong foundation, Square has the opportunity to not only excel in financial technology but also set the standard for inclusive, value-driven workplaces. With stronger alignment in leadership, a renewed focus on respect and innovation, and hiring managers who embody these principles, the company could create an even more impactful and inspiring environment for its teams and candidates.",
        "cons": "Cons:\n\t•\tLeadership and company culture don’t always align with the values they promote. For example:\n\t•\tEmpathy: Some interactions during the interview process lacked basic engagement and respect, which felt at odds with the company’s commitment to this value.\n\t•\tTransparency: It was evident the position had already been filled before my interview, but this was not communicated. This lack of openness diminished trust in the process.\n\t•\tInnovation: Suggestions for thinking outside the box during a role-play exercise were dismissed outright, which seemed contradictory to Block’s emphasis on creativity.\n\t•\tKnowledge Gaps: One of the interviewers did not know how to answer when asked how they foster a positive company culture. This is a red flag, as fostering culture is fundamental to a company’s leadership and values.",

My experience with them was detailed, thorough, and professional, setting a high standard for candidate engagement.\n\t•\tSquare has created groundbreaking products that genuinely help businesses thrive. Being part of a company that prioritizes empowerment and accessibility is inspiring.\n\t•\tDuring the interview process, I encountered a leader who truly embodied the values of empathy, inclusion, and innovation. His engagement and thoughtfulness demonstrated what leadership at Square could and should look like, and it was inspiring to see these values in action.",

      "# [Block, Inc. by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2010-05-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc.)\nAmerican financial services company\n\n\"Square, Inc.\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Square (video game company).\n\nBlock, Inc. (formerly Square, Inc.[10]) is an American technology company that provides financial services to consumers and merchants.[11][12][13] Founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey, it is the U.S. market leader in point-of-sale systems.[14][15][16] As of 2023, Block serves 56 million users and 4 million sellers,[17][18] processing $228 billion in payments annually.[4]\n\nBlock's inaugural product Square, launched in 2009, is a point-of-sale system.[14] It allows sellers to accept card payments and manage various operations, including bookings,[19] e-Commerce,[20] inventory,[21] payroll, shift scheduling,[22] banking, and obtaining business loans.[23] Additionally, Block's portfolio includes Cash App, a consumer-focused digital wallet introduced in 2013.[12][24] This wallet allows users to send, receive or save money,[25][26] access a debit card, invest in stocks and bitcoin,[27][28] apply for personal loans,[29] and file taxes.[30] Block also owns Afterpay, a buy now, pay later service;[31] Bitkey, a self-custody bitcoin wallet;[32][33] a hardware business in bitcoin mining;[34][35] and Tidal, a music streaming service.[36]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n2009: Conception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original inspiration for Block's first product \"Square\" occurred to Jack Dorsey in 2009 when his friend Jim McKelvey was unable to complete a $2,000 sale of his glass faucets and fittings because he could not accept credit cards.[37] Co-founders Dorsey—who also co-founded Twitter—and McKelvey began developing the company out of a small office in St. Louis.[38] The name \"Square\" derives from the company's square-shaped card reader product.[39][40]\n\n2010–2014: Early years\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to Forbes, Block, named Square, Inc. then, tested its payment method on 50,000 merchants in the summer of 2010, and was reporting a chargeback rate of less than 0.05 percent.[41] In February 2011, Square was reportedly valued at approximately US$240 million, signing up 100,000 new merchants every month.[42] In April 2011, Square announced that it has secured an investment from Visa.[43] In October 2011, the company stated that it was processing about US$2 billion per year in payments through its \"Square\" card readers, charging 2.75 percent per swipe.[44]\n\nIn 2012, Starbucks and Square announced a partnership that would allow Starbucks to use the Square payment technology to accept payments for coffee. In the same year, Starbucks also reportedly invested in Square at a valuation of US$25 million.[45] Square was handling an annual payment volume of around US$6 billion around that time.[46]\n\nIn 2013, Square launched Cash App, a peer to peer payment service.[26] In October 2014, the company launched the integration of a payroll feature into its Square payment processing system, following the integrations of a merchant cash advance offering, a customer feedback product and an invoicing service into the system.[47]\n\n2015–2020: Initial public offering, growth\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, Square stated that it processed about US$23.8 billion worth of payment volume in 2014.[48] In the same year, the company sold shares in its initial public offering for US$9 per share, giving itself a market capitalization of $2.9 billion.[49]\n\nIn 2018, Vox reported Square as stating that over 7 million people used the Cash App in December 2017. Vox also stated that Cash App was the \"No. 1 free finance app\" in Apple's U.S. iPhone App Store and was \"ahead\" of PayPal and Venmo.[24]\n\nIn October 2020, Square put approximately 1% of their total assets ($50 million) in Bitcoin (4,709 bitcoins), citing Bitcoin's \"potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future\" as their main reasoning.[50] The company purchased approximately 3,318 bitcoins in February 2021 for a cost of around $170 million, bringing Square's total holdings to around 8,027 bitcoins (equivalent to around US$500 million in 2021, around US$481 million as of July 2024).[51]\n\n2021–2022: Name change, acquisitions\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 2, 2021, Square reached an agreement to acquire majority ownership in Tidal. Square paid $297 million in cash and stock for Tidal, with Jay-Z joining the company's board of directors. Jay-Z, as well as other artists who currently own stock in Tidal, will remain stakeholders.[52][53][54]\n\nOn December 1, 2021, Square announced that it would change its company name to Block, Inc. on December 10.[55][56] The change was announced shortly after Dorsey resigned as CEO of Twitter.[57] On December 10, 2021, the name change took effect, and Square, Inc. became Block, Inc.[58] On December 16, less than a week into the rebrand, H&R Block, sued the company for trademark infringement, claiming that the name seeks to confuse customers by misappropriating the Block brand name, which H&R owns.[59] The lawsuit was resolved in April 2023 when the two companies jointly agreed to dismiss the suit.[60]\n\nOn January 31, 2022, Block completed its acquisition of Afterpay, an Australian buy now, pay later (BNPL) lender.[61]\n\n2023–present: Service issues, business realignment\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2023, Afterpay suffered a service issue which led to a sudden reduction in the spending limits for many users. At least 2000 users reported experiencing a difficulty with the service. Afterpay acknowledged the problem and said it was working on a fix.[62] On September 7 and 8, 2023, Square and Cash App experienced outages, affecting thousands of users. Card payment processing, peer-to-peer payments and other transactions were among the impacted operations. On September 8, 2023, Block informed that the service disruptions had been resolved and all systems were operational by the afternoon of that day. It also said the outage was caused by an issue with the company's Domain Name System (DNS), and did not stem from a cyberattack.[63][64] In the following week, Block apologized to its customers and acknowledged “this situation was made more difficult by our communication”. To reduce the risk of a similar outage in future, the company said it had deployed a new set of firewall and DNS server changes, expanded offline payment capabilities so merchants can still accept payments in offline mode, and put in place additional measures.[65] Later in the month, Block said in a regulatory filing that the CEO of its Square business, Alyssa Henry, was set to leave the company in October 2023, and that Jack Dorsey, serving then as the \"Block Head\" and Chairperson, would take on an additional role of \"Square Head\".[66]\n\nIn February 2024, Block reported an annual \"Gross Payment Volume\" of US$228 billion and an annual income of $9.8 million for the year 2023.[4] In April 2024, CNBC reported that Block announced it had finished the development of its own standalone three-nanometer bitcoin mining chip and was in the process of working through the design with a semiconductor foundry. The company was also reported to be developing a \"full bitcoin mining system\", stating that its goal was to both decentralize the supply of bitcoin mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate — a proxy for industry competition and mining difficulty. In this regard, according to CNBC, Block was solving a \"major barrier to entry\" posed by the relative difficulty in sourcing mining rigs, their high prices and unpredictable delivery.[35] In May 2024, the company's Square platform was found to be the market leader in point-of-sale systems in the U.S.[16][15] In July 2024, Block signed a \"large-scale crypto mining hardware pact\", agreeing to supply its chips to bitcoin miner \"Core Scientific\". The company did not disclose financial details of the pact.[34][67] In October 2024, Bitkey appeared in TIME's list of the \"best inventions of 2024\".[68][69] In November 2024, Fortune reported that Block was laying off many employees from its Tidal, TBD and Square services.[70] That same month, Block announced it was \"winding down\" TBD, \"scaling back\" investments in Tidal and focussing its resources on its bitcoin mining initiative as well as Bitkey, while adding that it was \"refining\" its investments based on progress.[71][72]\n\nSubsidiaries, products, services\n\n[edit]\n\nSquare\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Square (payment system)\n\nSquare is a payments platform that allows businesses to accept card payments and use smartphones or tablets or computers as payment registers for a point-of-sale system (POS).[73][14][74] The platform was founded in 2009 by Dorsey and McKelvey. Square also offers additional features to manage various operations including staff payroll and shift schedules,[22] customer bookings,[19][75] inventory,[21] e-Commerce,[20][76][77] banking and business loans.[23]\n\nIn 2022, a Protocol survey showed that 35% of U.S. small business owners used Square, a higher percentage than its competitors, while also highlighting the POS market's continued fragmentation.[78] In April 2023, Square was reported to have 4 million merchants as its customers.[79][17] Its client base includes small and medium-sized businesses as well as larger ones.[80][13][81] As of 2024, the platform is available in the U.S., Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Republic of Ireland, Spain and the U.K.[82], and is the U.S. market leader in point-of-sale systems.[16][15]\n\nCash App\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Cash App\n\nLaunched in October 2013, Cash App (formerly Square Cash) is a digital wallet which allows sending and receiving money, investing in stocks or bitcoin, and filing taxes.[12][25][26] In March 2015, the firm introduced Square Cash for businesses, which includes the ability for individuals, organizations, and business owners to use a unique username, known as a $cashtag, to send and receive money.[83] As of 2023, Cash App also offers a savings account and a debit card, and services such as direct deposit and investing in stocks and Bitcoin.[27][28] In March 2023, USA Today reported that Cash App offered a free tax-filing service while cautioning that it didn't accommodate \"every tax situation\" and didn't offer \"live tax support\".[30] In October 2023, it was reported that Cash App also allowed users to borrow up to $200 from the app, and that \"not everyone is an eligible user for this feature\".[29]\n\nCash App has been found to be the preferred payment app among lower-income adults in the U.S.,[84] reporting 56 million \"monthly active users\" as of 2024.[18]\n\nAfterpay\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Afterpay\n\nAfterpay is an Australian digital payment platform in which a bought product can be paid off in four installments. This idea made in 2008 by a then eighteen-year-old Nick Molnar was geared towards millennials and inspired by the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Molnar and Partner/ Co-founder Anthony Eisen launched their platform in 2014 and in four years their product reached a market capitalization of around $3.3 billion. In February 2020, Afterpay was reported to have 3.6 million active customers in the US, 3.1 million in Australia and New Zealand, and 600,000 in the UK. According to ABC News (Australia) in August 2021, Afterpay had operations in the U.S., Canada and New Zealand, as well as in the U.K., France, Italy and Spain as Clearpay.[85] In the same month, Afterpay and Block announced that Afterpay would be acquired by Block.[86] Block paid US$29 billion in stock for the acquisition and the process was finalized in January 2022. Molnar and Eisen continued to lead Afterpay's merchant and consumer businesses following the acquisition.[61][31]\n\nAs of 2023, Afterpay serves 24 million users and 348,000 merchants,[87][88] processing US$27.3 billion in payments annually.[89] It also ranks among the three most-used BNPL services globally.[90]\n\nBitkey\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Bitkey\n\nIn December 2023, Block launched Bitkey, a self-custody Bitcoin hardware wallet, in 95 countries including the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Nigeria, Argentina, Mexico, and India. The wallet allows investors to own, manage and store their Bitcoin without relying on third-party exchanges or custodians. Bitkey includes a mobile app, hardware device, and a set of recovery tools in case the customer loses the phone, their hardware or both. The wallet cannot access or move a customer's Bitcoin without them.[32][33][91] In October 2024, TIME named Bitkey as one of the \"best inventions of 2024\".[68][69]\n\nBitcoin mining system\n\n[edit]\n\nIn April 2024, Block announced it had finished developing its own standalone three-nanometer bitcoin mining chip and was working through the design with a semiconductor foundry. The company reportedly aimed at building a \"full bitcoin mining system\", stating that its goal was to decentralize both the supply of bitcoin mining hardware and the distribution of hashrate.[35] In July 2024, Block signed an agreement to supply its chips to bitcoin miner \"Core Scientific\".[34][67]\n\nTidal\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Tidal (service)\n\nTidal is a high-definition music streaming service with a catalog of over 100 million songs across various genres. It offers both a subscription plan and an ad-supported free plan.[92][93] Originally launched in 2014 by Aspiro, a Norwegian company, Tidal was purchased in 2015 by American rapper Jay-Z for $56 million, reportedly to \"give artists more control over the distribution of their music\".[94][95] At that time, Tidal was available in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Republic of Ireland, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.[92] In 2021, Block took majority ownership of Tidal for $297 million,[36] stating it aimed to find \"new ways for artists to support their work\" and to create \"tools that can help support musicians' businesses\".[96][95] Tidal was then operating in a streaming market dominated by Spotify and others, and was paying \"better royalty rates\" to artists than its rivals including Spotify.[97][96] In May 2023, Wired reported that Tidal's “Direct Artist Payouts” scheme, in which up to 10 percent of a user's subscription fee was delivered to the artists they listened to most, had been discontinued in 2022. According to Wired, the scheme was \"thoughtful\" and supportive of bands and artists, and its closure reduced some of Tidal's market differentiation.[93] In November 2024, Block announced it was \"scaling back\" investments in Tidal after reports emerged that the company was laying off Tidal employees.[71][72][70][98] Block added it was eliminating Tidal's product management and product marketing functions entirely and that Tidal would become a smaller entity, focusing on fewer areas while emphasizing product development.[98]\n\nFinancials\n\n[edit]\n\nSquare received angel investments from Marissa Mayer, Kevin Rose, Biz Stone, Dennis Crowley, Shawn Fanning, MC Hammer, and Esther Dyson.[citation needed] Since then, it has raised several additional rounds of funding:\n\nSeries A funding from Khosla Ventures[99]\n\nSeries B funding from Sequoia Capital[99]\n\nSeries C funding from Kleiner Perkins[99]\n\nSeries D funding from Citi Ventures, Rizvi Traverse Management, and Starbucks[100]\n\nSeries E funding from Goldman Sachs, Rizvi Traverse Management, and GIC Private Limited[101]\n\nThe company's valuation in October 2014 was $6 billion.[102] On November 19, 2015, Square had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial valuation of $2.9 billion, down by more than half from its last valuation in October 2014 at $6 billion. The series E funding shares had different rights than the common shares sold at the IPO, therefore the $6 billion 'valuation' from October 2014 is wrong. Although the firm was yet to make a profit as of 2015 and had lost $420 million since 2012, it had decreased its losses from 44% of revenues to 16% in the six months leading up to its IPO.[103] For the fiscal year 2018, Square reported losses of US$38 million, with an annual revenue of US$3.299 billion, an increase of 49.0% over the previous fiscal cycle.\n\nYear[104] Revenue\n\nin mil.

In May 2020, Square announced that some of its workers would be allowed to be permanent remote workers.[110] As of 2021, although Block's real estate footprint remains intact, they no longer have a designated headquarters location.[2]\n\nFinancing and acquisitions\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2014, Victory Park Capital, an asset management firm, invested in Square Capital.[111] In May 2015, Square Capital raised additional funding, with Victory Park Capital tripling its initial investment.[112] As of 2016, Square had loaned $1 billion to companies through Square Capital since the program's inception.[113] On November 19, 2015, Square Inc. became a public company via an initial public offering.[114][115] On April 19, 2018, Square announced that it had acquired Zesty, a food delivery service that caters to corporate offices.[116][117] On April 26, 2018, Square announced that it would acquire Weebly, a website-building service, for $365 million.[118] In May 2019, Square announced that it had acquired Eloquent Labs, an artificial intelligence startup helping improve the customer service experience.[119]\n\nIn February 2020, Square announced that it had acquired Dessa, a Toronto-based deep learning company.[120] In November 2020, Square announced it was acquiring Credit Karma Tax, a free do-it-yourself tax-filing service, from Credit Karma for $50 million and would make it a part of its Cash App unit.[121] In March 2021, Square announced it was acquiring a significant majority in music streaming platform Tidal for $293 million in a deal of stock and cash.[122] In the same month, Square's Q1 sales surged 266% as transactions jumped amid economic recovery.[123] In August 2021, Square announced its acquisition of Afterpay, a company offering a \"buy now, pay later\" service. Square finalized the $29 billion stock deal on January 31, 2022.[124][61]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nAllegations of illegal activity\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 23, 2023, investment research firm Hindenburg Research disclosed a short position in Block, leading to a 15% drop in the company's shares that day. Hindenburg's accusations of Block included exaggerating user counts, failing to curb fraud and illegal activity on Cash App, and permitting impersonation of high-profile individuals. It also wrote in its report that Block \"embraced predatory offerings and compliance worst practices in order to fuel growth and profit from facilitation of fraud against consumers and the government.\"[125][126]\n\nBlock responded to the allegations in a press release saying, \"We intend to work with the SEC and explore legal action against Hindenburg Research for the factually inaccurate and misleading report they shared about our Cash App business today\".[127]\n\nNBC News reported in May 2024 that prosecutors at the Southern District of New York were examining financial transactions and internal practices at Block, stemming from alleged compliance lapses at its Square and Cash App units. According to the report, the company allegedly failed to collect adequate information from customers, processed transactions involving countries subject to economic sanctions, and processed cryptocurrency transactions for terrorist groups.[128] In November 2024, Block disclosed in its earnings report for July-September 2024 that it was negotiating a potential settlement with several state regulators that had probed the company's anti-money laundering program. Additionally, Block stated it was negotiating a potential settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in matters including those related to Cash App's handling of customer complaints and disputes. The company added it had accrued a liability for estimated amount in connection with each potential settlement and the amount was not material to the company's financial statements as of September 30, 2024.[129][130]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",

      "# [New report highlights opportunities for digital assets to empower businesses in displaced communities](https://www.ebrd.com/news/2024/new-report-highlights-opportunities-for-digital-assets-to-empower-businesses-in-displaced-communities.html)\nNew report by the EBRD and Block, Inc. shows digital assets and blockchain technologies can help support the financial inclusion of businesses in displaced communities\n\nUkrainian entrepreneurs use bitcoin and digital wallets to overcome financial displacement\n\nReport highlights public-private partnerships are needed to improve financial and digital literacy and expand digital financial infrastructure\n\nDigital Assets, including bitcoin and stablecoins, can foster financial inclusion for businesses in displaced communities, according to a new report by Block, Inc. and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).\n\nThe report, published today, addresses the critical issue of financial exclusion among displaced populations worldwide, and highlights the potential of mobile, digital, and digital asset-based financial services to support displaced businesses.\n\nAs the number of forcibly displaced individuals in 2023 reaches 117.2 million globally, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and with more than 376 million people displaced by climate-related disasters since 2008, the need for financial innovations that deliver economic empowerment to displaced communities has never been more pressing.\n\nThe report notes that more than 75 percent of adults in countries experiencing humanitarian crises live outside the formal financial system, leaving them unable to rebuild their lives or businesses, due to the lack of recognised assets or documentation to use as collateral.\n\n\"Displaced populations often face compounded challenges, including being perceived as high-risk by financial institutions due to difficulties in meeting identity requirements and the unpredictability of their incomes,\" the report notes. \"These challenges significantly hinder their ability to access essential financial services, exacerbating their already precarious situations.\"\n\nThe joint report from Block, Inc. and EBRD underscores the potential of digital assets, including bitcoin and stablecoins, to address some of these challenges. Unlike traditional financial systems, blockchain-based solutions do not rely on legacy infrastructure, which can make them more reliable, affordable, and accessible to displaced entrepreneurs. The report emphasises the benefits of self-custody wallets, which enable safe cross-border storage and access to funds, giving individuals and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) control over their assets during conflicts or emergencies - and provides real-life use cases from Ukrainian refugees.\n\n\"The successful use of digital assets following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine provides a powerful example of how these technologies can offer practical support in crisis situations,\" the report states.\n\nMicro, small, and medium sized businesses are highlighted in the report as crucial to economic growth and stability, especially within migrant, displaced, and diaspora communities. In emerging markets and developing economies, MSMEs account for approximately 78 percent of employment.\n\nHowever, the inability of displaced entrepreneurs to access financial services hinders migrant integration and exacerbates social issues such as homelessness.\n\nDespite the promise of these technologies, the report acknowledges the barriers to their widespread adoption, including regulatory challenges, financial education, and connectivity issues. The report advocates for public-private partnerships to overcome these obstacles by improving financial and digital literacy, expanding digital financial infrastructure, and creating enabling regulatory frameworks.\n\nPaul Mortby, Head of EMEA Policy for Block, Inc, stated “Today’s report highlights how emerging technologies and financial innovations can rise to meet some of the biggest challenges faced by nations today. As the number of displaced communities and climate change continues to grow, it is critical that we support the development of financial tools that restore agency and economic empowerment to those impacted, and help them to integrate into their new communities. The potential of emerging bitcoin and stablecoin solutions to help alleviate the challenges faced by displaced populations is significant.”\n\nJacek Kubas, Head of the Digital Hub at the EBRD said: “Innovative technologies such as digital wallets, online payment solutions and blockchain can play a crucial role in supporting unbanked populations and refugee communities. They are already proving invaluable in conflict zones such as Ukraine, where displaced MSMEs rely on them to maintain access to assets and to ensure business continuity. The EBRD is always exploring new ideas and products that could increase SMEs’ financial inclusion, access to finance and a greater integration with new markets, and as we expand into Sub-Saharan Africa, such insights will help guide our work and maximise impact there as well.”\n\nFor more information or to access the full report, please visit block.xyz/ebrd.\n\nBlock, Inc.

      "# [Block Changes Ticker to “XYZ” to Give a Holistic Business Appeal by Sheryl Sheth, sheryl-sheth on 2025-01-10](https://www.tipranks.com/news/block-changes-ticker-to-xyz-to-give-a-holistic-business-appeal)\nJack Dorsey-led Block (SQ) is changing its ticker symbol to “XYZ” to give a more holistic business appeal. Block has a dual-listed structure, with its shares trading under the ticker “SQ” on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and under the symbol “SQ2” on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Both the tickers on NYSE and ASX will change and start trading under the symbol “XYZ” on January 21 and 22, respectively.\n\nThe rebranding efforts aim to bring Block’s diverse financial business under one roof. Block is a fintech company offering financial services under the brands Cash App, Square, Afterpay, and TIDAL. Along with the ticker symbol change, Block also announced the date for releasing its fourth quarter Fiscal 2024 results, to be reported on February 20, after the market closes. Interestingly, in 2021, Dorsey changed the company’s name from “Square” to “Block” to align with his interest in blockchain technology and make it more inclusive of the various businesses.\n\nAnalysts’ Expectations from Block in 2025\n\nRecently, analysts from two leading research firms reviewed their ratings and outlook on Block stock for 2025. Let’s take a quick look at their views:\n\nKBW analyst Sanjay Sakhrani lowered the price target on SQ stock to $100 from $105, implying 15.3% upside potential from current levels. The five-star analyst has a Hold rating on Block as part of his overall outlook for the fintech group. Sakhrani believes that the companies’ December quarter results and outlook for 2025 will be in focus and influence the stock’s movement. Even though macroeconomic headwinds such as currency and fuel prices persist, the analyst is optimistic about consumer spending trends, which have shown improvement since Q3 FY24.\n\nRaymond James analyst John Davis upgraded SQ stock to Buy from Hold and assigned a $115 price target, implying 32.6% upside. Davis is particularly encouraged by Block’s Seller GPV (gross payment volume) growth, which is expected to boost in 2025. He forecasts Seller GPV to return to double-digit figures this year, driven by easing comps, continued sales momentum, international expansion, and innovation in product offerings. Moreover, Davis believes that SQ stock is currently undervalued as compared to its peers and has scope for a recovery over time.\n\nAre Block Shares a Good Buy?\n\nWall Street remains highly bullish about Block stock’s trajectory. On TipRanks, SQ stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 23 Buys, four Holds, and one Sell rating. The average Block price target of $101.15 implies 16.6% upside potential from current levels. In the past year, Block shares have gained 27.8%.\n\nSee more SQ analyst ratings",

      "# [Top Block (Square) Shareholders by Nathan Reiff on 2021-01-07](https://www.investopedia.com/square-top-shareholders-5094562)\nBlock (SQ) is an online payment and financial services company. Formerly known as Square, the company develops hardware and software to help business operations, including point-of-sale hardware, payments processing and analytics software, a business debit card called Square Card, and a peer-to-peer payment service called Cash App.\n\nThe company's top individual shareholders are Jack Dorsey, Alyssa Henry, and Roelof Botha. The top institutional shareholders of Block are the Vanguard Group, BlackRock, and FMR.\n\nBlock generates revenue through two reported segments: Cash App and Seller, the latter of which includes a variety of managed payment services, software, hardware, and other financial services. Its trailing 12-month (TTM) revenue is $20.79 billion, with a TTM net income of -$282.12 million. The company's market capitalization was $49.07 billion as of Feb. 23, 2024.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the top shareholders of Block.\n\nTop 3 Individual Insider Shareholders\n\nThe shares mentioned below are directly owned by individual insider shareholders and do not count shares held indirectly or accessed through stock options.\n\nWhen company insiders buy or sell company stock, they must file a Form 4 with the SEC disclosing the transaction. 13F forms are used for large money managers who hold more than $100 million in assets, while 13D or 13G forms are used for people or institutions that own more than 5% of a company's stock. Each of these forms provides a way for investors to track significant positions made by major investors.\n\nThe following figures are as of the company's proxy statement from April 2023 unless otherwise indicated.\n\nJack Dorsey\n\nJack Dorsey owns one million shares of Class A Block stock, representing about 0.2% of the total shares outstanding. He also owns about 47.85 million of the company's Class B stock or roughly 79% of the outstanding shares.\n\nDorsey, whose net worth as of February 2024 was approximately $4.9 billion, co-founded social networking company X (formerly Twitter) in 2006, before selling the company to Elon Musk in 2022 for $43 billion. He co-founded Block in 2009 and is the company's chief executive officer (CEO). He is also the chairman of the board.\n\nAlyssa Henry\n\nAlyssa Henry owns 755,712 shares of Block's Class A common stock. This represents less than 0.13% of shares. Like Dorsey, she also owns Class B stock—153,845 or 0.2% of the total outstanding shares.\n\nHenry joined the company as EVP of infrastructure of Square in 2014. She announced her retirement and left the company in 2023 Henry held leadership roles at Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nRoelof Botha\n\nRoelof Botha owns 713,608 Class A Block shares, representing less than 0.13% of shares.

      "# [2 Reasons to Buy Block Stock Like There's No Tomorrow by Ryan Vanzo, www.facebook.com on 2024-03-16](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/03/16/reasons-buy-block-stock-like-theres-no-tomorrow/)\nBlock's (SQ -0.64%) stock performance in 2020 helped mint a few millionaires. That pandemic-affected year, share prices zoomed higher, rising from $38 to $240.\n\nThen everything came crashing down at the end of 2021. In just six months, shares lost more than 80% of their value.\n\nFactoring in the decline and the potential this company has, right now is arguably the best time ever to buy Block stock. Two factors in particular stand out. First, shares are remarkably cheap for a company with such impressive growth rates. Second, this appears to be your last chance to secure a bargain valuation before the stock price takes off. Let me explain.\n\n1. Growth stocks rarely come this cheap\n\nGrowth stocks tend to be expensive. When companies have a proven record of growing revenue at double-digit rates for years at a time, the market prices shares accordingly.\n\nThere are two ways to buy growth stocks at a discount. The first is to invest early, before a track record of growth appears. The second is to buy growth stocks during a period of turmoil. That's the exact opportunity with Block stock today.\n\nAt its core, Block is a payments company. Its Square payment processing platform is used by millions of businesses every day. But the company also owns other notable assets, like Tidal, the music streaming platform founded by Jay-Z, and Cash App, the popular peer-to-peer money transfer service. With a tech-heavy approach to growing industries, Block has averaged revenue growth rates of nearly 50% annually.\n\nAs you can see in the chart above, Block's growth rates have come down in recent quarters. Still, over the past four quarters, revenue growth rates have ranged between 24% and 26%. This is still very much a company experiencing rapid growth.\n\nWhy, then, are shares priced so cheaply compared to the past? At just 2.4 times sales, Block stock trades at a cheaper valuation than at its IPO in 2015. Slower growth rates are partially to blame, but the biggest detractor appears to be an inability to remain profitable.\n\n2. This is the year Block's bargain valuation disappears\n\nWhen a company is growing quickly, the market is usually willing to backstop losses, sometimes for years at a time. Once growth slows, however, the market can quickly grow impatient.\n\nOn average, since its IPO in 2015, Block has just about broken even on an earnings-per-share basis. When the company turned profitable in 2020 and 2021, the share price raced higher to reflect this new reality: High growth rates and positive profits. When growth rates began to slow, however, these profits quickly reverted to losses -- a double whammy.\n\nLast fall, Block founder Jack Dorsey rejoined the company as CEO, promising a return to profitability. A few quarters later, his promises were realized, with Block posting its first quarterly profit in roughly two years.\n\nBlock's return to profitability has already been noticed by the markets. Since Dorsey stepped back into the ring, Block's share price, and thus most of its valuation metrics, have roughly doubled. But that doesn't mean Block stock is no longer a bargain.\n\nOn a forward basis -- that is, based on what analysts expect Block's sales to be one year from now -- the stock still trades at just 1.9 times sales. Few profitable companies growing sales at 20% to 25% per year are priced at such a valuation. A few years from now, today's stock price might even value the company below 1 times sales.\n\nThis is not a risk-free bet. Dorsey was able to return the company to profitability last quarter, but just barely so. Whether he can replicate this feat in the quarters to come remains to be seen. Plus, less than two years ago, the company actually posted a negative quarterly sales growth rate, although this came after its biggest growth spurt in company history. It is these caveats that keep the stock price at bargain levels.\n\nThe best time to buy Block stock was several quarters ago, before its turnaround started to become reality. The second best time, however, is right now. If Dorsey strings together another few profitable quarters, there should be considerable upside for investors.",
