      "# [Who We Are on 2023-09-05](https://logic2020.com/company/our-values/)\n“I know I can trust the culture and integrity of what my company stands for. I walk into work every day with a smile knowing I get to come back to a place where I feel respected and valued as an employee.”\n\nThe origin of our company values\n\nTo decide our values, we began by creating a small internal committee of diverse people from across our organization. This committee surveyed all our employees to understand the values that were most important to them in three categories: personal, internal (within our company), and external (to our clients). These included words like curiosity, integrity, improvement, dedication, and harmony, to name a few.\n\nWe then collated the responses and categorized them by general themes. With the themes pinpointed, we brought them together to form our three values. Both our leadership and consultants quickly championed these values in internal meetings and client relationships—and the rest is history.\n\n“Our Culture of We empowers me to make decisions that better the company, to spend time getting to know everyone at Logic20/20 on a first name basis, and to invest my time and resources in others.”",

Good people don't stick around. For a tech org, Logic20/20 operates like the 1990s. Old ways, old tech, old platform. Inefficient at best. Benefits are decent. 401k match is 1% which sucks compared to industry standards. The match is not paid until the next year and is not guaranteed if you leave. Every day is a fire drill based on what the C Suite feels priority is. Constant stress. Employees don't get acknowledged for good work or project completion. Always onto the next task. Fear based leadership = micromanaging. Careful with this. Seems innocent at first but it's not worth being apart of. They push surveys and goals to increase survey scores. Maybe look at the real problems and address them rather than force high ratings. When people leave, might or might not get severance or pto time. Subjective. Depends if leaders like them or not.",

My time spent interviewing was not worth the outcome. \r\nMany moving parts, skills/practice mismatch. No visibility on project opportunities to apply - you are basically left with trusting management to find a fit for your \"dream\" project. Noone is perfect, right? - look into the risk of not having a project, or filling in for just an ad-hoc project. Overall, you might end up underutilizing your potential and skills, or lacking knowledge leverage. They do offer free courses for different certs but it's not the same as the real experience. \r\nManagement invests heavily into marketing of its  \"We\" culture with lots of events and happy hours. It's all great but instead I'd rather have a better 401K match or unlimited free parking, especially with such a revenue growth rate!",

Logic20/20 is a certified minority owned business and certified by three separate bodies: the federal government, the state, and the NMSDC. The process to be certified is lengthy and rigorous.  Logic20/20 is committed to being a diverse employer and, at the time of this response, 40% of the workforce are female (well above industry norms).  Of a nine person senior leadership team, two are female and two are East Indian. \r\n\r\nThe work conditions are of great importance to us. We have been growing at a rapid pace which has, in turn, grown our consultant workforce and we are actively looking for the right space and location and hope to announce something in the coming months. \r\n\r\nCareer progression: every employee has a manager and career counselor, with the goal of providing support and guidance to achieve success. We empower and encourage our employees to take advantage of internal and external trainings that provide value to their career growth. \r\n\r\nAs with most local consulting models, there are a number of individual contributor roles for a variety of business reasons. Consistently, over many years, more than 70% of our projects are multi person teams with defined outcomes. Our clients range from multiple fortune 500 companies, recently funded start-ups, and state and local government.\r\n\r\nOur retention rate appears consistent with industry norm. We reviewed our records and at no time, going back over the past 24 months, has there been attrition as described by the reviewer.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact the HR team at HR@logic2020.com with any additional feedback as we always strive to find areas where we can improve.",

The leadership team at Logic20/20 is not only knowledgeable and experienced, but also genuinely invested in the growth and well-being of their employees - something I will admit, not all employees here may get the opportunity to experience. I feel lucky to live in the Seattle area, where I can go into the office and see our leadership team in-person, whenever I want. It's allowed me several opportunities to casually chat with them, and you can see the genuine authenticity in \"practicing what they preach\" about our company values. \n\nThere is also a strong emphasis on professional development and career autonomy here. I've benefited a lot from the learning opportunities I've had access to, but I'll be candid in stating \"autonomy is not for the weak-minded.\" Having autonomy to learn and grow with how I see my career advancing means not always having a written path to follow from management. I have plenty of support and access to tools, sure, but it's on me to be motivated enough to use those things to advance my career. If you're a self-starter, you're going to do so SO well here.",

          "advice": "Your \"Culture of We\" is moot with how you treat your consultants and analysts. Consultants are left holding the bag for everyone else even though we actually do the work contained within the RFPs and SoWs.\r\n\r\nIf something is a bonus, don't sic your HR dogs on me when I choose not to participate. Make it mandatory if you want it to be mandatory. Meaning, if I don't have a project to give you, then you should have a conversation with the sales team as to why they can't sell any projects, not come down on consultants because that's not our job. If your headhunter recruiters and TAs can't find anyone to work, that's their problem, not ours. Maybe they should spend less time making cute posts on LinkedIn and actually do something productive. I am working a project for you. The bonuses would be nice, and I would be happy to receive a referral bonus or the project generation bonus, but I can't just make things up out of thin air, and I am uncomfortable doing so because, and I know this is a foreign concept to most management and HR at this company, I have a moral compass and don't like to lie or cheat my way to the top. I work hard. Dang hard. And I'm smart, capable, and a quick learner. No matter how I feel or how you have treated me, you'll never take any of that away from me. That is my main job. Sales and recruitment doesn't get engaged when consultants need help on their projects, so why do sales and recruitment get catered to, and consultants are forced to do the catering? Also, why do consultants get the boot when recruitment and sales can't generate clients, employees, and projects?\r\n\r\nI can confidently say, after being furloughed and officially severed, I don't think anyone at this company ever gave a dang (I wish Glassdoor would let me use my four-letter words. Just assume them) about me or anyone else in my situation. No one is even helping me find new work after treating the others and me so poorly. They know how bad the job market is right now, and it's frightening that they still sleep soundly at night after how they've treated some of us.\r\n\r\nHowever, all of this said, this is just the culture in this god-awful country. I doubt you'll change anything, and I'm sure your HR pawn is going to come reply to this talking about all of those \"accolades\" given to you by companies run by other rich people and say a bunch of buzzwords to try and soften the blow. Yawn. Real people can see what working for you is like. I'm more mad at myself for trusting any of you to do the right thing. Thought I finally found a company that treats its workers with respect and would fight the good fight. Never again. Congrats Logic, I will never trust another company ever again in my life. Companies and corporations want to complain that no one is loyal anymore. Well, this kind of culture and business ethic is the cause. You know the scene in Billy Madison where they're doing the Jeopardy-esque competition, and Billy chooses Business Ethics for his opponent, and his opponent has a total meltdown because his opponent (the antagonist trying to take over Madison Hotels) has no moral compass to even have a grasp of what ethical behavior is within the context of running a business, and he's essentially just a greed-monger? That's a metaphor for the leadership, HR, and management at Logic.\r\n\r\nI find it very strange how many new hires I've seen with Logic recently on LinkedIn when you've just furloughed/severed so many good people. \"We always work hard to find projects for our consultants, but it can be difficult sometimes.\" as other replies have said. Riiiiight. Lots of hiring going on. The math ain't mathing! :) Keep towing that line, though, HR person.\r\n\r\nAlso, I noticed the most recent 4-star review was from a former employee that started at least 5 years ago and has subsequently moved on. Coincidentally, that review was submitted on August 7th, after your most recent mass layoff. A random ex employee coming to give a 3+ star review during a time of poor reviews isn't a good look when you're good at connecting dots, Logic. ;) Either you're creating fake reviews, or you're reaching out to old employees and begging them to offset the negative reviews because of your greedy, self-absorbed leadership/HR/management. Nice. Hey, maybe it's a coincidence. (Doubt it.)\r\n\r\n\"If you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life thinking it's stupid.\" Companies need to stop putting all of the load of training and upskilling on their employees and candidates. Most anyone can do anything with the right amount of guidance, training, and mentorship. Your company offers none. Your CDLs basically just say \"Here's this vague area you could upskill in\" and that's only if you're lucky with a CDL with some semblance of leadership and mentorship. That's not guidance. That's not training. That's acting like you're guiding people, and getting your \"dopamine candy\" and tricking your brain into believing you're actually doing something when you aren't, oh and fluffing your resume with a bogus title that you didn't actually do anything to earn.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "Where to begin:\r\n\r\n-As much as they claim in the replies, they don't value loyalty. They don't care how hard you work for them. You are on the chopping block at all times, and they'll make excuse after excuse about how \"hard\" it is to find projects for people. Interesting that a consulting firm's main barrier is... *checks notes* consulting projects. Maybe your sales team and TAs are just... bad at their jobs? If most of your replies say \"It's difficult to find projects for people\", then shouldn't you realize that the way your sales team goes about finding and securing projects is wrong? But that's another issue thrown onto the backs of the consultants. Essentially, if you want a project to work on, you have to generate it yourself while sales does... something? If I wanted to generate my own projects, I would be an independent consultant.\r\n\r\n-Don't let the day 1 smiles and camaraderie fool you. Lots of crossed fingers behind backs. There will come a time where you're thrown to the wolves, no matter how hard you worked for them.\r\n\r\n-Leadership is two-faced, and mid-management/HR tows the line, as evidenced by the other reviews gaslighting employees basically saying the \"you aren't good enough, and your job is to do better to serve your corporate masters\" schtick. Ironically, I would if they would just let me know what to train for them. They have no idea what they want you to do, so they can literally offer no guidance in how you can upskill, even if it's FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMPANY.\r\n\r\n-If you're furloughed or severed, you're hit with the classic corporate gaslight of \"think of the business\". I'll get right on that. I'm glad you're considering I don't know where my next mortgage payment is going to come from just because the execs want a bigger EoY bonus. My audaciousness in not \"thinking of the business\" is noted.\r\n\r\n-Speaking of execs, no matter how much they want to sing the praises of the CFO, she's clearly read too many Ayn Rand books, leading to cutthroat policies when things get a little difficult. \"Screw you, I got mine\" is the actual culture of this company, regardless of all of their virtue signaling and empty words.\r\n\r\n-Regardless of DEI/Volunteer policies, they WILL sever/furlough you as soon as it's inconvenient for them to keep you on payroll, no matter if you're a straight, white man or a BIPOC woman or anything in between. I worked with all types. And all types got furloughed/laid off. It's part of business, it's not necessary, but corporations act like it is. Their first and only concern is their bottom line. It's not even a publicly traded company, so they have no SEC laws holding them down with \"bUt ThE sHaReHoLdErS\" routines. The leadership and management could take a pay cut or a bonus reduction, any corporation could, but they'll never choose that path even though they're essentially running a dying business. \"Screw you, I got mine\" again. They basically make you feel secure in your job, everyone in your professional circle is totally unaware and thinks you're going to be benched, and then the day of a meeting titled \"Bench Sync\" they tell you you have 8 hours to decide whether you want to choose furlough or severance. The only difference is with severance, you get one extra paycheck on top of your eventual PTO payout (if you have any accrued), and with furlough, you don't get that paycheck but you keep your healthcare benefits for up to 90 days while they \"try to find a project for you\" and you're \"top priority\" for any projects that come about. So basically, you're given the choice of an extra paycheck to pay your bills for a slightly longer amount of time or rolling the dice and hoping that they find you a project. A DEI/Volunteer policy that is rendered null due to how quickly these people will throw you to the wolves when their exec bonuses are threatened.  They don't care about human beings. Therefore, they can't care about a subset of marginalized human beings. If you're given the option, just sever. They're not going to find you a project, and it's just better to hurt their wallet and hopefully try to teach them the way they're treating people is wrong.\r\n\r\n-They give you no warning. I knew my project was coming to an end, and I made the obviously terrible choice of trusting them to put me on the bench. I should have started to look for another job, but I trusted their golden smiles. Everyone around me was totally shocked to learn I was being furloughed/severed. However, they could have given me professional courtesy and said \"Hey, we don't have any spots on the bench. If we can't find you a project when this one ends, you'll probably be furloughed.\" And, to be clear, I wasn't the only person furloughed in this group. This is clearly a greed move. I got nothing but starry-eyed reviews from anyone involved in my circle - coworkers, CDL, and managers. It wasn't a performance-based layoff. When I pressed on this issue, their response was \"Well we don't want to lose our good people.\" Got it. So, your idea of \"not losing your best people\" is basically waiting until the last second to let someone know their mortgage is insecure. Honestly, this review wouldn't be half as scathing as it is if they had just given me a fair warning. But their chosen option is to spring a furlough on you at the flip of a switch. Disgusting. Again, a self-absorbed way to handle the situation. Profits over people. Yes, HR person replying to this, I know, I know - \"While we are continually looking to generate profits...\" Yawn. I can't be bothered to care. Ya know. Got that whole \"mortgage\" thing I'm worried about. Not that that moves any of you.\r\n\r\n-They celebrate tenured employees constantly at quarterly all-hands meetings. The problem with this is, unless you're part of the good ol' boys and girls club that came into the company from the UK/Australia with the CEO, it's pretty impossible to achieve any sort of tenure due to how easily they'll just furlough/sever people. And, at a certain point, your idea of celebrating tenure and loyalty becomes nothing more than patting yourselves on the back for furloughing people. They don't care how hard you work for them, they don't care how much effort you give, they will treat you like every other company in the US. \"Profits over people. Screw the workers. Make sure leadership stays rich.\" They claim they invest every dollar back into the company, but if that were true, they wouldn't be furloughing and severing people at a moment's notice. Leadership would take the hit, and create more bench space with money redirected from exec salaries and bonuses. They don't. You're worthless to them. A worm on a sidewalk.\r\n\r\n-As a consultant, you aren't just a consultant. You also have to do sales and recruitment as well. These roles are purported to be bonus ventures for consultants, but if you don't participate, you get to have a 1on1 with a snarky HR person and explain why you didn't participate and give out your friends' and family's personal information out for free. And \"I don't know anyone who has the power or money to pay for a consulting project\" isn't an acceptable answer. I had even referred a couple of friends already, but that didn't count. They wanted new names for their lists exactly when they demanded them. Do you all think we have gigantic social circles? Look up Dunbar's Number on Wikipedia and get back to me. I'm sure they'll turn around and gaslight me here and say, \"Well, you'd be on a project if you had found one for yourself.\" Then what do you pay the sales people for? If I'm expected to generate my own projects, then what's the point of even having a sales department?\r\n\r\n-They're extremely inconsiderate. You are just a pawn in their money game. An example of this is them pushing you to use up all of your PTO. At first glance, this sounds great. It sounds like the company cares about your well-being. What it really is, though, is insidiously pushing you to take vacations when you aren't prepared/don't want to so they don't have to pay out liquid cash when they inevitably find a reason to furlough/sever you.\r\n\r\n-Most revenue comes from Microsoft projects for staff aug. Basically, if you have an 18-6 badge from Microsoft, you're at extreme risk of losing your job if they don't find you another project when your 18 months is up. And they're putting all of their eggs in one basket. So, when, I don't know, hypothetically, if they tick off your Microsoft client, they're essentially sowing seeds of discontent within Microsoft. I know of a client that has sworn off entertaining any RFPs from Logic due to terrible management of a project coming from at least three steps above me. That cookie is going to crumble, no matter how many rugby matches the CEO wants to go play with Microsoft employees. Every disgruntled Microsoft client is a sown seed of discord that will bring that eventuality to pass. It's like they have no conception of how other people operate and function. If I'm someone's friend or trusted coworker, and they tell me \"Hey, I once worked with this firm and it was awful. I wouldn't advise\" there's no amount of cute sales pitches from Halo Effecters that is going to make me take them up on their offer. Plenty of consulting firms around to choose from. One bad review is a death knell, and an easy way to cross someone off a list. I know I've told everyone I know that I'd never work for them again, and I'd advise them not to work for Logic either. If I did, I'd be off-project ASAP after continuing looking for other forms of employment while on-project. If they want to treat me like a disposable peon, then I'll treat them like a paycheck. Nothing more. Nothing less. Logic doesn't deserve me or the people they've screwed over. They claim they're trying to break into other markets, but I wouldn't trust anything they say as far as I can throw a 100 pound rock at this point.\r\n\r\n-The career development is a ruse. They basically claim they help you develop your career, but it's all on paper. They give you no direction or guidance. They don't tell you what to learn or how you can better contribute, it's up to you to decide to go learn something, and if it's a skill they don't need for any potential projects in the pipeline you basically just wasted your time. If you're furloughed, there's no support to help you get back on your feet somewhere else. Not even a casual networking offer. They essentially want you to work for them or not at all even if you're not employed by them. And, let's just say they get REAL mad if your project is coming to an end and a consultant decides to jump ship instead of trusting them to do the right thing. EVERYTHING is a projection coming from the top, HR, and mid-management.\r\n\r\n-All furloughs and bad things happening are just \"flukes\" and \"bumps in the road\" every time the question is asked in quarterly all-hands meetings. The weird part is it's becoming a pattern that they won't acknowledge. And, rest assured, they NEVER \"foresee any further furloughs and layoffs coming. We really think the market is taking a turn for the better.\" It's always just a lie to keep you passive and lull you to sleep. If I was a betting person, I'd bet they're always looking for ways to furlough/sever people with how many times and people I've seen it happen to in the short time I was there. There's definitely a loose pattern that has been established.\r\n\r\n- I told my CDL that I was willing to learn anything and work any project. They said that's a good thing because some people are picky about their projects. I'm not. I'm really a great employee with a penchant for learning anything new that the company wants me to, but there's no direction. They have no pipelines to advise employees to tell them what to do to help better contribute. I just want a living wage and a decent work/life balance, and that's too much for Logic to handle.\r\n\r\n-They engage their non-compete clauses. I know that for a fact. Won't go further because I'm sure they'll come after me if I do.\r\n\r\n-Digital Transformation consultants! - If your project is coming to an end, they will put ONE of you on a massive project, make you take the heat from the client, and essentially turn you into a meat shield so mid and upper management doesn't have to. I felt awful for the DT consultant on my project. They worked that poor person to the bone...",

So, if it's low, I'll always side with my fellows in the working class as I don't tow the line or act as a lap dog like HR and mid-management does. It's low.\r\n\r\n- Non-management employees are a delight to work with that don't just tow the line and throw you under the bus when they can get ahead by doing so. Mid-management, HR, and leadership cannot be spoken for here.\r\n\r\n-Great place to get your foot in the door to better options. This is not a company you can spend a lot of time at as they will furlough/sever you at a moment's notice even when you bust your tail for them. (This is @ consultants only. Plenty of HR and mid-management that can \"water cooler talk\" and tow the line (aka bootlick) their way into staying for multiple years.

Fear based leadership = micromanaging. Careful with this. Seems innocent at first but it's not worth being apart of. They push surveys and goals to increase survey scores.

        "advice": "Your \"Culture of We\" is moot with how you treat your consultants and analysts. Consultants are left holding the bag for everyone else even though we actually do the work contained within the RFPs and SoWs.\r\n\r\nIf something is a bonus, don't sic your HR dogs on me when I choose not to participate. Make it mandatory if you want it to be mandatory. Meaning, if I don't have a project to give you, then you should have a conversation with the sales team as to why they can't sell any projects, not come down on consultants because that's not our job. If your headhunter recruiters and TAs can't find anyone to work, that's their problem, not ours. Maybe they should spend less time making cute posts on LinkedIn and actually do something productive. I am working a project for you. The bonuses would be nice, and I would be happy to receive a referral bonus or the project generation bonus, but I can't just make things up out of thin air, and I am uncomfortable doing so because, and I know this is a foreign concept to most management and HR at this company, I have a moral compass and don't like to lie or cheat my way to the top. I work hard. Dang hard. And I'm smart, capable, and a quick learner. No matter how I feel or how you have treated me, you'll never take any of that away from me. That is my main job. Sales and recruitment doesn't get engaged when consultants need help on their projects, so why do sales and recruitment get catered to, and consultants are forced to do the catering? Also, why do consultants get the boot when recruitment and sales can't generate clients, employees, and projects?\r\n\r\nI can confidently say, after being furloughed and officially severed, I don't think anyone at this company ever gave a dang (I wish Glassdoor would let me use my four-letter words. Just assume them) about me or anyone else in my situation. No one is even helping me find new work after treating the others and me so poorly. They know how bad the job market is right now, and it's frightening that they still sleep soundly at night after how they've treated some of us.\r\n\r\nHowever, all of this said, this is just the culture in this god-awful country. I doubt you'll change anything, and I'm sure your HR pawn is going to come reply to this talking about all of those \"accolades\" given to you by companies run by other rich people and say a bunch of buzzwords to try and soften the blow. Yawn. Real people can see what working for you is like. I'm more mad at myself for trusting any of you to do the right thing. Thought I finally found a company that treats its workers with respect and would fight the good fight. Never again. Congrats Logic, I will never trust another company ever again in my life. Companies and corporations want to complain that no one is loyal anymore. Well, this kind of culture and business ethic is the cause. You know the scene in Billy Madison where they're doing the Jeopardy-esque competition, and Billy chooses Business Ethics for his opponent, and his opponent has a total meltdown because his opponent (the antagonist trying to take over Madison Hotels) has no moral compass to even have a grasp of what ethical behavior is within the context of running a business, and he's essentially just a greed-monger? That's a metaphor for the leadership, HR, and management at Logic.\r\n\r\nI find it very strange how many new hires I've seen with Logic recently on LinkedIn when you've just furloughed/severed so many good people. \"We always work hard to find projects for our consultants, but it can be difficult sometimes.\" as other replies have said. Riiiiight. Lots of hiring going on. The math ain't mathing! :) Keep towing that line, though, HR person.\r\n\r\nAlso, I noticed the most recent 4-star review was from a former employee that started at least 5 years ago and has subsequently moved on. Coincidentally, that review was submitted on August 7th, after your most recent mass layoff. A random ex employee coming to give a 3+ star review during a time of poor reviews isn't a good look when you're good at connecting dots, Logic. ;) Either you're creating fake reviews, or you're reaching out to old employees and begging them to offset the negative reviews because of your greedy, self-absorbed leadership/HR/management. Nice. Hey, maybe it's a coincidence. (Doubt it.)\r\n\r\n\"If you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life thinking it's stupid.\" Companies need to stop putting all of the load of training and upskilling on their employees and candidates. Most anyone can do anything with the right amount of guidance, training, and mentorship. Your company offers none. Your CDLs basically just say \"Here's this vague area you could upskill in\" and that's only if you're lucky with a CDL with some semblance of leadership and mentorship. That's not guidance. That's not training. That's acting like you're guiding people, and getting your \"dopamine candy\" and tricking your brain into believing you're actually doing something when you aren't, oh and fluffing your resume with a bogus title that you didn't actually do anything to earn.",
        "cons": "Where to begin:\r\n\r\n-As much as they claim in the replies, they don't value loyalty. They don't care how hard you work for them. You are on the chopping block at all times, and they'll make excuse after excuse about how \"hard\" it is to find projects for people. Interesting that a consulting firm's main barrier is... *checks notes* consulting projects. Maybe your sales team and TAs are just... bad at their jobs? If most of your replies say \"It's difficult to find projects for people\", then shouldn't you realize that the way your sales team goes about finding and securing projects is wrong? But that's another issue thrown onto the backs of the consultants. Essentially, if you want a project to work on, you have to generate it yourself while sales does... something? If I wanted to generate my own projects, I would be an independent consultant.\r\n\r\n-Don't let the day 1 smiles and camaraderie fool you. Lots of crossed fingers behind backs. There will come a time where you're thrown to the wolves, no matter how hard you worked for them.\r\n\r\n-Leadership is two-faced, and mid-management/HR tows the line, as evidenced by the other reviews gaslighting employees basically saying the \"you aren't good enough, and your job is to do better to serve your corporate masters\" schtick. Ironically, I would if they would just let me know what to train for them. They have no idea what they want you to do, so they can literally offer no guidance in how you can upskill, even if it's FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMPANY.\r\n\r\n-If you're furloughed or severed, you're hit with the classic corporate gaslight of \"think of the business\". I'll get right on that. I'm glad you're considering I don't know where my next mortgage payment is going to come from just because the execs want a bigger EoY bonus. My audaciousness in not \"thinking of the business\" is noted.\r\n\r\n-Speaking of execs, no matter how much they want to sing the praises of the CFO, she's clearly read too many Ayn Rand books, leading to cutthroat policies when things get a little difficult. \"Screw you, I got mine\" is the actual culture of this company, regardless of all of their virtue signaling and empty words.\r\n\r\n-Regardless of DEI/Volunteer policies, they WILL sever/furlough you as soon as it's inconvenient for them to keep you on payroll, no matter if you're a straight, white man or a BIPOC woman or anything in between. I worked with all types. And all types got furloughed/laid off. It's part of business, it's not necessary, but corporations act like it is. Their first and only concern is their bottom line. It's not even a publicly traded company, so they have no SEC laws holding them down with \"bUt ThE sHaReHoLdErS\" routines. The leadership and management could take a pay cut or a bonus reduction, any corporation could, but they'll never choose that path even though they're essentially running a dying business. \"Screw you, I got mine\" again. They basically make you feel secure in your job, everyone in your professional circle is totally unaware and thinks you're going to be benched, and then the day of a meeting titled \"Bench Sync\" they tell you you have 8 hours to decide whether you want to choose furlough or severance. The only difference is with severance, you get one extra paycheck on top of your eventual PTO payout (if you have any accrued), and with furlough, you don't get that paycheck but you keep your healthcare benefits for up to 90 days while they \"try to find a project for you\" and you're \"top priority\" for any projects that come about. So basically, you're given the choice of an extra paycheck to pay your bills for a slightly longer amount of time or rolling the dice and hoping that they find you a project. A DEI/Volunteer policy that is rendered null due to how quickly these people will throw you to the wolves when their exec bonuses are threatened.  They don't care about human beings. Therefore, they can't care about a subset of marginalized human beings. If you're given the option, just sever. They're not going to find you a project, and it's just better to hurt their wallet and hopefully try to teach them the way they're treating people is wrong.\r\n\r\n-They give you no warning. I knew my project was coming to an end, and I made the obviously terrible choice of trusting them to put me on the bench. I should have started to look for another job, but I trusted their golden smiles. Everyone around me was totally shocked to learn I was being furloughed/severed. However, they could have given me professional courtesy and said \"Hey, we don't have any spots on the bench. If we can't find you a project when this one ends, you'll probably be furloughed.\" And, to be clear, I wasn't the only person furloughed in this group. This is clearly a greed move. I got nothing but starry-eyed reviews from anyone involved in my circle - coworkers, CDL, and managers. It wasn't a performance-based layoff. When I pressed on this issue, their response was \"Well we don't want to lose our good people.\" Got it. So, your idea of \"not losing your best people\" is basically waiting until the last second to let someone know their mortgage is insecure. Honestly, this review wouldn't be half as scathing as it is if they had just given me a fair warning. But their chosen option is to spring a furlough on you at the flip of a switch. Disgusting. Again, a self-absorbed way to handle the situation. Profits over people. Yes, HR person replying to this, I know, I know - \"While we are continually looking to generate profits...\" Yawn. I can't be bothered to care. Ya know. Got that whole \"mortgage\" thing I'm worried about. Not that that moves any of you.\r\n\r\n-They celebrate tenured employees constantly at quarterly all-hands meetings. The problem with this is, unless you're part of the good ol' boys and girls club that came into the company from the UK/Australia with the CEO, it's pretty impossible to achieve any sort of tenure due to how easily they'll just furlough/sever people. And, at a certain point, your idea of celebrating tenure and loyalty becomes nothing more than patting yourselves on the back for furloughing people. They don't care how hard you work for them, they don't care how much effort you give, they will treat you like every other company in the US. \"Profits over people. Screw the workers. Make sure leadership stays rich.\" They claim they invest every dollar back into the company, but if that were true, they wouldn't be furloughing and severing people at a moment's notice. Leadership would take the hit, and create more bench space with money redirected from exec salaries and bonuses. They don't. You're worthless to them. A worm on a sidewalk.\r\n\r\n-As a consultant, you aren't just a consultant. You also have to do sales and recruitment as well. These roles are purported to be bonus ventures for consultants, but if you don't participate, you get to have a 1on1 with a snarky HR person and explain why you didn't participate and give out your friends' and family's personal information out for free. And \"I don't know anyone who has the power or money to pay for a consulting project\" isn't an acceptable answer. I had even referred a couple of friends already, but that didn't count. They wanted new names for their lists exactly when they demanded them. Do you all think we have gigantic social circles? Look up Dunbar's Number on Wikipedia and get back to me. I'm sure they'll turn around and gaslight me here and say, \"Well, you'd be on a project if you had found one for yourself.\" Then what do you pay the sales people for? If I'm expected to generate my own projects, then what's the point of even having a sales department?\r\n\r\n-They're extremely inconsiderate. You are just a pawn in their money game. An example of this is them pushing you to use up all of your PTO. At first glance, this sounds great. It sounds like the company cares about your well-being. What it really is, though, is insidiously pushing you to take vacations when you aren't prepared/don't want to so they don't have to pay out liquid cash when they inevitably find a reason to furlough/sever you.\r\n\r\n-Most revenue comes from Microsoft projects for staff aug. Basically, if you have an 18-6 badge from Microsoft, you're at extreme risk of losing your job if they don't find you another project when your 18 months is up. And they're putting all of their eggs in one basket. So, when, I don't know, hypothetically, if they tick off your Microsoft client, they're essentially sowing seeds of discontent within Microsoft. I know of a client that has sworn off entertaining any RFPs from Logic due to terrible management of a project coming from at least three steps above me. That cookie is going to crumble, no matter how many rugby matches the CEO wants to go play with Microsoft employees. Every disgruntled Microsoft client is a sown seed of discord that will bring that eventuality to pass. It's like they have no conception of how other people operate and function. If I'm someone's friend or trusted coworker, and they tell me \"Hey, I once worked with this firm and it was awful. I wouldn't advise\" there's no amount of cute sales pitches from Halo Effecters that is going to make me take them up on their offer. Plenty of consulting firms around to choose from. One bad review is a death knell, and an easy way to cross someone off a list. I know I've told everyone I know that I'd never work for them again, and I'd advise them not to work for Logic either. If I did, I'd be off-project ASAP after continuing looking for other forms of employment while on-project. If they want to treat me like a disposable peon, then I'll treat them like a paycheck. Nothing more. Nothing less. Logic doesn't deserve me or the people they've screwed over. They claim they're trying to break into other markets, but I wouldn't trust anything they say as far as I can throw a 100 pound rock at this point.\r\n\r\n-The career development is a ruse. They basically claim they help you develop your career, but it's all on paper. They give you no direction or guidance. They don't tell you what to learn or how you can better contribute, it's up to you to decide to go learn something, and if it's a skill they don't need for any potential projects in the pipeline you basically just wasted your time. If you're furloughed, there's no support to help you get back on your feet somewhere else. Not even a casual networking offer. They essentially want you to work for them or not at all even if you're not employed by them. And, let's just say they get REAL mad if your project is coming to an end and a consultant decides to jump ship instead of trusting them to do the right thing. EVERYTHING is a projection coming from the top, HR, and mid-management.\r\n\r\n-All furloughs and bad things happening are just \"flukes\" and \"bumps in the road\" every time the question is asked in quarterly all-hands meetings. The weird part is it's becoming a pattern that they won't acknowledge. And, rest assured, they NEVER \"foresee any further furloughs and layoffs coming. We really think the market is taking a turn for the better.\" It's always just a lie to keep you passive and lull you to sleep. If I was a betting person, I'd bet they're always looking for ways to furlough/sever people with how many times and people I've seen it happen to in the short time I was there. There's definitely a loose pattern that has been established.\r\n\r\n- I told my CDL that I was willing to learn anything and work any project. They said that's a good thing because some people are picky about their projects. I'm not. I'm really a great employee with a penchant for learning anything new that the company wants me to, but there's no direction. They have no pipelines to advise employees to tell them what to do to help better contribute. I just want a living wage and a decent work/life balance, and that's too much for Logic to handle.\r\n\r\n-They engage their non-compete clauses. I know that for a fact. Won't go further because I'm sure they'll come after me if I do.\r\n\r\n-Digital Transformation consultants! - If your project is coming to an end, they will put ONE of you on a massive project, make you take the heat from the client, and essentially turn you into a meat shield so mid and upper management doesn't have to. I felt awful for the DT consultant on my project. They worked that poor person to the bone...",
        "lengthOfEmployment": 2,
        "pros": "-Decent benefits with 401k (2% match), healthcare premiums are covered, PTO, work/life balance (for the most part). According to other reviews, wages are lower than market value. When I pressed this, I was met with an incredulous reply. I was pretty ok where I was at, but workers need to band together and get what they're owed from the rich. So, if it's low, I'll always side with my fellows in the working class as I don't tow the line or act as a lap dog like HR and mid-management does. It's low.\r\n\r\n- Non-management employees are a delight to work with that don't just tow the line and throw you under the bus when they can get ahead by doing so. Mid-management, HR, and leadership cannot be spoken for here.\r\n\r\n-Great place to get your foot in the door to better options. This is not a company you can spend a lot of time at as they will furlough/sever you at a moment's notice even when you bust your tail for them. (This is @ consultants only. Plenty of HR and mid-management that can \"water cooler talk\" and tow the line (aka bootlick) their way into staying for multiple years. Nothing you can do as a consultant other than do your job well and hope you get to stay.",

I've benefited a lot from the learning opportunities I've had access to, but I'll be candid in stating \"autonomy is not for the weak-minded.\" Having autonomy to learn and grow with how I see my career advancing means not always having a written path to follow from management.

      "# [Renewable energy forecasting with AI and ML by timd@logic2020.com, Alex Lago on 2024-02-20](https://logic2020.com/insight/renewable-energy-forecasting-with-ai-and-machine-learning/)\nRenewable energy forecasting quick summary: Faced with the shortcomings of traditional forecasting methods in dealing with the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, utilities are uncovering new possibilities with AI- and machine learning–powered forecasting solutions.\n\nWhen we look to the future of energy production in the United States, it’s clear that renewables will play an ever-increasing role. Driven primarily by long-term environmental concerns, as well as cost issues and job creation, the U.S. government and more than 20 states have set time-bound goals of achieving carbon-free electricity. The utility industry is still playing catch-up in determining how to best manage a growing range of renewable energy resources, particularly in the area of forecasting.\n\nAccurate forecasting is vital for ensuring a safe, consistent flow of energy when and where it’s needed. The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources is highlighting some of the shortcomings of traditional forecasting methods; fortunately, AI and machine learning technologies are enabling utilities to close the gap and take their renewables forecasting to new levels of precision.\n\nDrivers for more accurate renewables forecasting\n\nThe U.S. government has set a goal of reaching 100 percent carbon pollution–free electricity by 2035, and 21 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have each set their own clean electricity goals, with target dates ranging from 2032 to 2050.\n\nBoth utilities and consumers are responding to these initiatives by adding new renewable energy sources. Solar made up 45% of new electricity generation capacity added in the United States through the first three quarters of 2022, and the nation’s wind industry installed over 13,000 MW of new wind capacity in 2021—the second-highest amount installed in a single year.\n\nThe upsurge in renewable energy sources is certainly good news for the environment. For utilities, however, it presents new challenges around integrating these sources into the existing grid, particularly when it comes to forecasting and scheduling.\n\nRisks of erroneous forecasting\n\nErrors in forecasting have consequences that go far beyond inconveniences. If forecasts are too low to meet demand, the imbalance could result in brownouts or blackouts. If they overshoot the mark, utilities—and, eventually, customers—wind up paying for excess capacity.\n\nAnother consequence of faulty forecasts is the risk of under- or overscheduling energy and ancillary services. When wholesale power markets procure energy, they rely on accurate schedules that incorporate all sources, including renewables. If those forecasts are off the mark, the resulting schedules will likely be inaccurate, which could cause operational problems and price fluctuations.\n\nThe unique challenge of renewables forecasting\n\nOne of the challenges of relying on renewables is that they’re inherently less predictable than gas and fossil fuels. Availability of renewable energy is highly intermittent and particularly sensitive to changing weather conditions.\n\nFor solar energy, the most obvious challenge is that it can only be created during daytime hours. During those hours, even a passing cloud can significantly impact a solar photovoltaic (PV) farm’s output. In winter, snow accumulation on PV panels can also cause production of solar power to plummet.\n\nOn the wind energy side, high-speed katabatic winds (such as the Santa Ana winds in California) can damage turbines and thus may require wind farms to shut down. Wintry conditions pose a challenge for wind as well, as ice formation on rotor blades or instrumentation can cause safety hazards and thus require temporary stoppages.\n\nHydroelectric energy sources are also at the mercy of Mother Nature, as drought conditions can cause water levels to drop, reducing the force of water pressure needed to spin hydro turbines.\n\nThe current state of energy storage\n\nEnergy storage systems—in the form of batteries, thermal storage, mechanical storage, hydrogen storage, and pumped hydropower—can bank up energy from renewable sources when production is high (typically during the daytime) and release the stored energy at night or during other low-production periods, thus resolving the problem of intermittent availability.\n\nWhile the U.S. energy storage market set a new record in the third quarter of 2022, with new system installations totaling 4,733 MWh, it’s not yet up to the task of managing all our renewable sources. Energy storage systems currently make up only about 2 percent of the total U.S. generation capacity.\n\nBridging the gap with AI and machine learning\n\nThe latest advances in AI and machine learning are enabling utilities to fill the gap between their renewable energy forecasting needs and what their systems can deliver. AI models can train on far less historical data than their statistical counterparts, often as little as one to two years’ worth. AI-based platforms can incorporate data from a massive array of sources, including current weather reports and forecasts, demand patterns, and data from distributed energy resources (DERs). These technologies also let utilities to send real-time instructions to utility operators, DERs, and microgrids, enabling rapid responses to changing conditions. Finally, machine learning enables models to self-teach and become more accurate over time.\n\nHow it works\n\nAI-driven platforms such as Splight work as multi-layer digital infrastructures that can connect to any physical device, collect data in real time in a wide range of protocols, process that data, and generate forecasts that can be used to operate assets in real-time.\n\nIn the case of forecasting wind energy, for example, Splight integrates multiple variables, including historical data, weather information, grid data, and any other relevant parameters that can be taken in real time. The forecasting algorithm can teach itself to distinguish the variables that can increase accuracy from those that are irrelevant. Because it can watch and learn from the operational environment, the platform is able to process data from the entire network instead of from a single asset or data point.",
      "# [Scaling enterprise AI beyond pilot projects by timd@logic2020.com, Paul Lee on 2024-03-16](https://logic2020.com/insight/enterprise-ai-scale-beyond-pilot/)\nQuick summary: To scale AI beyond the pilot phase, organizations must anticipate and overcome the most common roadblocks and incorporate proven best practices into their strategies.\n\nContents\n\nWhy scale AI now?\n\nWhat does AI at scale look like?\n\nRoadblocks to scaling enterprise AI\n\nEmployee resistance\n\nData gaps\n\nSkill gaps\n\nTechnology gaps\n\nCost- and time-related challenges\n\nSo, how do you scale AI in an organization? 3 best practices\n\n1. Choose the optimal area(s) for expansion\n\n2. Create a campaign for building momentum\n\n3. Build AI into the organization\n\nThe end goal: becoming an AI-driven company\n\nDriven by the falling costs and increased accessibility of AI platforms, besides the proven business benefits, more enterprises are integrating these technologies into their product innovation strategies. According to a recent survey, 62 percent of U.S. firms are reporting a “moderate” or “significant” increase in their AI investments.\n\nOnce an enterprise has successfully implemented AI in one area, the next logical step is replicating the initial success in other areas. However, Forrester reports that an astounding 90 percent of decision-makers admitted having difficulties in scaling the number of AI use cases across their organizations.\n\nWhy the speed bump between pilot and scaling, and what can businesses do about it? In this article, we’ll explore five of the most common roadblocks that can stall AI scaling strategies—and offer insights on how to overcome them—as well as some of the best practices that enterprises have leveraged in driving their initiatives forward.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nWhy scale AI now?\n\nIn recent years, many businesses faced a slowdown in customer buying behavior, and adjusting to this reality often requires layoffs. As a result, previous product innovation strategies that would have been fueled by an army of personnel are now out of the question.\n\nAI-driven technologies can enable teams across the organization to achieve more with the staff they have. By implementing an AI scaling strategy, enterprises can build on the momentum of their initial success, maximize the business value of their investments in the pilot, and leverage best practices while those “lessons learned” are still top of mind.\n\nScaling AI also uncovers opportunities to solidify and expand an organization’s competitive edge. According to Forrester, 50 percent of companies believe scaling AI will enable them to remain competitive, and 39 percent believe it will propel them to a leadership position in their industry.\n\nRoadblocks to scaling enterprise AI\n\nOnce an enterprise has a proven success in enhancing products with AI, the obvious next step is to replicate the success elsewhere, and yet this is where many organizations stall out. Here are five of the most common areas where roadblocks can stymie efforts to scale AI in the enterprise:\n\nEmployee resistance\n\nOne of the biggest potential roadblocks in scaling AI is people-focused: many employees are apprehensive about adopting artificial intelligence because they fear their jobs are in danger. At this time, we can assert that AI has not yet evolved to a point where it can replace humans completely. To cite just one instance supporting this claim, as reported by Fast Company, CNET has been facing criticism since news came out that the tech outlet was publishing AI-generated articles under the byline “CNET Money Staff.” To make matters worse, Futurism found that not only did many of the articles contain errors; they sometimes plagiarized the work of human writers.\n\nThis is just one story highlighting the enduring need for “humans in the loop” when AI is implemented. Not only need employees not fear broad-based job cuts, but they also have the opportunity to broaden their resumes with skills such as managing AI bots, exploring new use cases, and implementing best practices.\n\nThe more effectively an enterprise can communicate to its employees how AI will—and will not—affect their jobs, the more quickly it can overcome this potential roadblock to successful AI scaling.\n\nData gaps\n\nEnterprise AI systems rely on data, and if that data isn’t up to the task, efforts to innovate with artificial intelligence could hit a wall. At least half of businesses struggle with data-related roadblocks to AI scaling, according to the Forrester study:\n\n58 percent of organizations cite data quality as a major obstacle in scaling AI.\n\n50 percent struggle with data integration for data science/machine learning and analytics/business intelligence platforms.\n\n52 percent simply don’t know what their AI data needs are.\n\nOne error organizations make is thinking their data is ready for AI because they designed their data management capabilities to satisfy business intelligence requirements. While there is overlap between the two areas, there are also significant differences. To ensure readiness for AI, not only must data be clean and current, but it also must be\n\nContinuously sourced from enterprise applications\n\nGoverned and managed securely\n\nMade accessible to AI teams\n\nSkill gaps\n\nAlongside the right data, successful enterprise AI scaling requires the right people to implement, integrate, and manage the technology. Data engineering, data science, and developer skills are all in short supply; to fill the gap, firms are challenged to either upskill their existing personnel or hire from outside.\n\nThis is one area where establishing an AI center of excellence (see below) can ease the burden. By centralizing AI-focused talent in a hub designed to support all areas of the organization, businesses can make the most efficient use of the personnel they have—and free individual departments from the need to compete for their own talent.\n\nTechnology gaps\n\nOf course, people need the right tools with which to work, and the gap between what enterprises have and what they need can be a hindrance to AI scaling. Fifty-eight percent of organizations say they lack the tools and platforms needed to build advanced analytics and machine learning models; 50 percent lack the solutions to operationalize these models, and another 50 percent lack the solutions to monitor models in production.\n\nFortunately, firms that have already executed a successful AI implementation will have at least some tools necessary to scale. When deciding which area to focus on next, enterprises may want to prioritize those that can easily leverage existing technologies.\n\nCost- and time-related challenges\n\nAs successful as an enterprise’s pilot program may have been, some outcomes may cause hesitation in implementing AI elsewhere. In the Forrester study, 56 percent of respondents noted that the project cost of their initial AI implementation was higher than expected, and 41 percent affirmed that the project was delivered late.\n\nInstead of allowing time and budget overruns to become a hindrance to scaling, businesses can chalk them up to “lessons learned” and incorporate this knowledge into their project plans for the next enterprise AI implementation.\n\nSo, how do you scale AI in an organization? 3 best practices\n\nWhen we work with clients on scaling AI in their organizations, we implement proven best practices that can advance progress towards their goals while making the most efficient use of their resources.\n\n1. Choose the optimal area(s) for expansion\n\nWhen enterprises look at scaling AI, the obvious first question is “where next?” To maximize the chances of success, we look for areas where AI\n\nWould be easy to implement\n\nIs likely to be accepted by employees\n\nHas enough data avaiable for model training\n\nHas the potential to deliver solid business value\n\n2. Create a campaign for building momentum\n\nWith an AI scaling plan in place, the next step is to “take the show on the road” and start building support across the organization. Build a pitch deck documenting the successes of the pilot project, with an emphasis on how AI is making team members’ lives easier (for employees) and/or how it’s delivering business value (for leadership). Then meet with key stakeholders at all levels, beginning with leadership, and build a team of evangelizers who will help carry the AI message.\n\nThis support will be critical not only in procuring the necessary funding for the next enterprise AI implementation, but for initiating a cultural shift in which employees embrace AI as a net good that can improve the employee experience, create happier customers, and deliver solid benefits to the bottom line.",
      "# [The AI call center: How artificial intelligence empowers customer service reps to generate revenue by Rachel Parker, Paul Lee on 2024-05-10](https://logic2020.com/insight/ai-call-center-generates-revenue/)\nQuick summary: Call center AI tools enable customer service organizations to empower their reps and evolve from cost centers to revenue generators.\n\nContents\n\nMeet your new sales force\n\nWill AI replace call center agents?\n\n10 AI call center use cases for empowering customer service reps to generate revenue\n\n1. Uncovering customer intent\n\n2. Suggesting the next best action\n\n3. Delivering automatic summaries\n\n4. Recommending knowledge base content\n\n5. Delegating to virtual assistants\n\n6. Offering payment arrangement widgets\n\n7. Empowering agents with response suggestions\n\n8. Improving call routing\n\n9. Gaining access to predictive analytics\n\n10. Helping detect fraud\n\nAI delivers real results in customer service KPIs\n\nTaking the customer care rep experience to a new level\n\nThe future of AI in call center applications\n\nMany customer service organizations are already familiar with the cost-saving benefits of call center AI technologies. Gartner predicts that, by 2026, conversational AI within contact centers will reduce costs by $80 billion. However, today’s enterprises are looking beyond cost cutting and recognizing how empowering agents with AI can transform customer service organizations from cost centers into revenue-generating assets.\n\nMeet your new sales force\n\nThrough call center AI applications, customer service reps tap into valuable insights that empower them to turn customer interactions into selling opportunities. And because AI bots can handle low-level requests such as password resets, human reps have more time to spend on revenue-generating conversations instead of rushing to pick up the next call.\n\nWhen a major telecom enterprise put this principle into practice, they found it quite easy to train their customer service reps in the art of selling products and services. Call center reps deal with customers directly day in and day out, so it’s only natural that they become experts in the problems and aspirations surrounding the customer experience. This expertise forms a solid foundation for reps to capitalize on opportunities for discussing the organization’s latest promotions, new products, upgrade offers, and more.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nWill call center AI replace agents?\n\nThe short answer is no. The fact is that call center AI technology is still limited in its capabilities. It’s unlikely that call center AI software will replace human agents anytime soon.\n\nOne big reason is that AI isn’t empathetic yet, meaning it can’t deal with human emotions like a customer service rep can. Thus, a virtual agent cannot replicate the most critical functions of a human agent, such as building rapport, detecting customer sentiment, and creating an authentic connection with the caller.\n\nAnother reason is that AI can’t think on its feet. It can only solve problems and deal with the situations it’s trained to. Human agents, on the other hand, can adapt to any situation and come up with creative solutions.\n\nAdditionally, AI, like any technology, can make mistakes. AI systems, particularly those based on machine learning, rely heavily on its training data. The AI’s responses might be inaccurate or inappropriate if the training data is limited or biased.\n\nThe bottom line is that customer interactions are complex, nuanced, and unpredictable. AI still lacks the genuine care and human touch essential to fostering trust in a call center environment.\n\nIt’s important to note that AI and human agents often work best in tandem. AI can handle routine, repetitive tasks efficiently, freeing human agents to deal with more nuanced or creative problem-solving tasks. This combination can lead to a more efficient and effective problem-solving process overall.\n\n6 call center AI use cases for empowering customer service reps to generate revenue\n\nCustomer service organizations are leveraging artificial intelligence for call centers in various ways to accelerate the resolution of customer issues and to deliver context-based insights to human agents. Both these outcomes help call centers transform into revenue generators by\n\nAllowing the reps more time for discussing products and services\n\nProviding customer-specific information that reveals selling opportunities\n\n1. Uncovering customer intent\n\nIn traditional customer service interactions, it often takes the rep several minutes of question-and-answer to discover the caller’s true intent. AI and machine learning–based intent prediction models can analyze call content in real time and compare it with known “trigger topics.” They can then pinpoint the reason for the customer’s call with high accuracy and deliver the exact resources the agent needs to resolve the issue promptly.\n\n2. Suggesting the next best action\n\nBecause call center AI technologies enable real-time analysis of calls, they can use this data as context in recommending to the rep the right solution for the customer at the right time.\n\n3. Delivering automatic summaries\n\nCustomer service agents have historically spent considerable time taking notes during customer calls, which not only diverts their attention from the conversation but also involves a high risk of error. Call center AI enables the creation of summaries automatically at the end of each call, which can then be stored in the customer record as context for the next interaction.\n\n4. Recommending knowledge base content\n\nCustomer service representatives can spend as much as 5 to 10 minutes per call searching through the organization’s knowledge base for information they need regarding promotions, troubleshooting steps, internal system notifications, etc. AI models can be trained to predict and deliver the most relevant knowledge base articles for resolving the specific issue based on the customer’s profile and/or activity.\n\n5. Delegating to virtual assistants\n\nBy implementing AI-powered virtual assistants (“chatbots”), organizations offer customers the opportunity to self-serve for simple tasks like resetting a password or changing an address. More requests handled by call center AI means fewer calls and messages going to human agents, who are then freed up to spend more time on revenue-driving activities.\n\n6. Offering payment arrangement widgets\n\nFor some organizations, many of their customer service interactions center around bill payments, and many of these can be resolved by offering the customer a payment arrangement. By building payment arrangement widgets into their virtual assistant platforms, organizations can leverage AI to\n\n1. Auto-detect the customer intent from inputs such as “I can’t pay my bill this month.”\n\n2. Determine which payment arrangement(s) are available to the customer based on their profile.\n\n3. Deliver a link to a self-service form where the customer can review terms and choose a payment plan.\n\n7. Empowering agents with response suggestions\n\nThe best use case of call center AI is utilizing it to supplement an agent’s capabilities instead of replacing them. Response suggestion is a fantastic example.\n\nHere, AI generates a set of recommended responses that a human agent can use. These are based on real-time conversation analysis, historical data, and predefined patterns.\n\nThe benefit is that agents can deliver more accurate, timely, and effective responses, improving the agent’s performance. In addition, it improves the chance of novice agents saying the right things even without too much training.\n\nAI can even suggest personalizations based on the caller’s profile, purchase history, and demographics. For instance, AI can bring up a product the customer bought before so that the human agent can suggest something similar.\n\n8. Improving call routing\n\nCall center AI can be used before an agent has even lifted the phone through a process called routing.\n\nTraditionally, calls in contact centers are routed to agents based on set criteria. For instance, a long-term customer or VIP can be directed towards the senior agents on the customer service team.\n\nAI optimizes this process significantly by making routing decisions faster and on the fly. These can be based on customer data gathered from multiple channels such as chat, email, and the company database.\n\nFor instance, AI can identify that a customer has a specific need based on their history or language. The system can then route the call to an agent who’s skilled at tackling that particular customer issue.\n\nAI can even route calls to another channel. If a customer says he prefers chat, then AI can automatically connect them to a chatbot or agent.\n\n9. Gaining access to predictive analytics\n\nPredictive analytics is a powerful tool that lets call center AI make operational suggestions for the call center based on history.\n\nThe common application to this is call volume forecasting. In this case, AI predicts the volume of calls based on historical data and seasonal patterns. Therefore, it can recommend adding or removing agents accordingly, enabling the center to meet demand while reducing costs.\n\nAI tools can also make churn predictions, identifying “at-risk” callers more prone to complaining or dropping out. Call centers can use this information to adopt a better approach or implement targeted retention strategies.\n\nPredictive analytics also helps segment customers based on criteria such as purchasing behavior, demographics, or interaction history. This lets agents tailor-fit their approach for a better customer experience.\n\n10. Helping detect fraud\n\nAI can pick up on the subtle hints that could indicate that a caller is involved in fraud. Plus, it has instant access to a wide range of data to detect anomalies much faster.\n\nFor instance, voice biometrics can analyze the caller’s voice and match that with a saved voice clip from a legitimate user. If AI detects inconsistencies, it will flag it as fraud.\n\nCall center AI can also analyze the speech patterns of the caller and uncover any deviations in language, tone, or behavior. Sudden changes, such as nervousness, may trigger the caller as a potential fraud. AI can even compare voices from a database of known fraudsters.\n\nThe good news is that, over time, machine learning algorithms can train AI to spot inconsistencies much better. It can also analyze new data to adapt to new fraud techniques.",
