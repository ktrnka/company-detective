You had all these dreams of being a leader, with a seat at the table, driving real change.\n\nBut things haven’t turned out quite like you planned. You’ve been stuck in a relationship that’s been holding you back.\n\nOver the years you’ve made excuses for it. “Maybe this is how it’s supposed to be.” “Everyone else seems to put up with it.” “They say relationships take a lot of work.”\n\nBut let’s get one thing straight: It’s not you. It’s your HR software.\n\nIt doesn’t respect your time. It takes hours and hours of manual work just to get simple things done. And then there are the empty promises. “We’re always improving.” Oh yeah? When’s the last time it shipped a new product for you? 2019? Your work friends hate it, too. Sorry. They won’t say it, but they find your software inaccessible and off-putting.\n\nWe’re only bringing this up, because we think you could do better.

Online version you can see tasks (maybe if you have a joint admin account not sure about regular users) the app does not feature a task icon on iphone or android, so unless you pay attention to e mails they give you to your work or personal email you wont know what tasks need to be done.\n\n3. The app learning management is different than online, feels a little too bunched up trying to do questionnaires and watch videos. \n\n4. The app sometimes for some users just logs them in, and it is up to the user to navigate and fill things out, making HR have to walk each employee through the process of on boarding. Needs better flow, maybe even call to actions to walk employees through onboarding each section.\n\n5. When it comes to loading documents, on android it has problems sometimes saying error when accessing camera to take a photo, you need to exit app take a photo and then use photo upload. \n\n6. It shows the entire company, and if you have your personal phone number uploaded on on boarding, it shows it to the company employees too. Some people dont want personal information like that available to everyone in the company and you cant manually change it otherwise the company wont have information for you either. \n\n7. Some companies do not issue work e mails, so \nIf you have a personal one, it wont show, maybe a plus maybe not?\n\n8. They have an emergency contact section but only for one person and one number, would be great to have up to 3 people and 1 mobile and alternate for both. Would be nice if it showed a relation field too so i could put mom, dad, uncle, cousin, s/o or something as well, if i call and that person doesnt know who i am to someone they may hang up.

You end up playing this game proxying communication through your HR person to rippling’s support team because they are the only ones able to get an actual phone number for humans on the other end.\n\nThat’s not the worst part - Eventually rippling’s website updated to show my policy and a few months later my health insurance was cancelled with no notification or warning! I had the pleasure of finding out I was uninsured when I went to go get a vaccine. As a matter of fact rippling’s website showed it was still good until Nov (this was in July) and they took no accountability to admit they were wrong when I verified it with BCBS. A little notice would’ve been nice. What’s great is I couldn’t communicate with any humans on rippling’s side! Literally no phone number, all communication is through your company’s HR person. My HR person didn’t know what was going on and assured me it was probably a glitch on rippling’s side since their website said the policy was still active. I couldn’t patch BCBS to Rippling to verify it was an error on their side because of the whole no humans thing so at the end of the day I was left without health insurance for a month while waiting for my policy on the private market to activate. \n\nRippling is a totally dishonest company that takes zero accountability for critical faults on their end. Come on rippling this isn’t a fun todo list app startup, it’s people’s lives. Put some humans on the phone…",

      "# Difficult app, 3 stars [(mrsuggestions, Apple App Store, 2022-08-25)](https://apple/9016485397)\nDifficult app on the end user side - some issues below:\n\n1. The app works better on iphone than android\n\n2. Online version you can see tasks (maybe if you have a joint admin account not sure about regular users) the app does not feature a task icon on iphone or android, so unless you pay attention to e mails they give you to your work or personal email you wont know what tasks need to be done.\n\n3. The app learning management is different than online, feels a little too bunched up trying to do questionnaires and watch videos. \n\n4. The app sometimes for some users just logs them in, and it is up to the user to navigate and fill things out, making HR have to walk each employee through the process of on boarding. Needs better flow, maybe even call to actions to walk employees through onboarding each section.\n\n5. When it comes to loading documents, on android it has problems sometimes saying error when accessing camera to take a photo, you need to exit app take a photo and then use photo upload. \n\n6. It shows the entire company, and if you have your personal phone number uploaded on on boarding, it shows it to the company employees too. Some people dont want personal information like that available to everyone in the company and you cant manually change it otherwise the company wont have information for you either. \n\n7. Some companies do not issue work e mails, so \nIf you have a personal one, it wont show, maybe a plus maybe not?\n\n8. They have an emergency contact section but only for one person and one number, would be great to have up to 3 people and 1 mobile and alternate for both. Would be nice if it showed a relation field too so i could put mom, dad, uncle, cousin, s/o or something as well, if i call and that person doesnt know who i am to someone they may hang up.

Recently had a situation where I needed to use my work’s COBRA policy and got no help whatsoever from rippling. Had to communicate with BCBS directly and fix errors made on rippling’s side. Unlike gusto or literally any other benefits company, you can’t communicate with any humans on Rippling’s side, which is infuriating to both the employee and health insurance provider. Who thought that was a good idea?? Having a dedicated HR person at your company doesn’t replace having someone at rippling if they don’t have access to what rippling does. You end up playing this game proxying communication through your HR person to rippling’s support team because they are the only ones able to get an actual phone number for humans on the other end.\n\nThat’s not the worst part - Eventually rippling’s website updated to show my policy and a few months later my health insurance was cancelled with no notification or warning! I had the pleasure of finding out I was uninsured when I went to go get a vaccine. As a matter of fact rippling’s website showed it was still good until Nov (this was in July) and they took no accountability to admit they were wrong when I verified it with BCBS. A little notice would’ve been nice. What’s great is I couldn’t communicate with any humans on rippling’s side! Literally no phone number, all communication is through your company’s HR person. My HR person didn’t know what was going on and assured me it was probably a glitch on rippling’s side since their website said the policy was still active. I couldn’t patch BCBS to Rippling to verify it was an error on their side because of the whole no humans thing so at the end of the day I was left without health insurance for a month while waiting for my policy on the private market to activate. \n\nRippling is a totally dishonest company that takes zero accountability for critical faults on their end. Come on rippling this isn’t a fun todo list app startup, it’s people’s lives. Put some humans on the phone…",

      "# Post ID vcfyu7: I chose Rippling and highly regret it with +256 score by [(Rlvantage, Reddit, 2022-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/)\nThis is actually my first post here, but you guys are an amazing, helpful community and I wanted to share my experience so others are aware of how r/Rippling operates. I did my research before choosing Rippling, but apparently not enough. I went over my contract in depth before signing with Rippling, but apparently not good enough. Hopefully by reading my cautionary tale, I can prevent someone from making the same mistake. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nWe started with Rippling in March, and at first everything was going great. They actually have a really good setup to streamline the HR side of things with small businesses, and have some good extra technology features (for a cost) that I have not seen similar companies offer. We had 9 employees to start, and were told that Rippling charges per employee per month. So if at any time we hired more employees, we would obviously pay more that month for the additonal employees, which we were fine with. After several Zoom sessions with our Account Executive, we signed a 15mos contract.\n\nSince March we have gained and lost employees (due to us re-structuring the company), leaving our current total number of employees at 15. Well this month we were charged $800 more than what our usual bill is. When we reached out because we were obviously confused, we were told the higher charge was because Rippling is charging us for the number of employees we have, which is 25. We quickly said no that is not correct, we only have 15 employees. To which the response from Rippling was, \"well you once had 25 employees, so you need to continue to pay for 25 employees even if you don't have 25 employees\". \n\nWell seeing how Rippling is now telling us we have to pay an extra $800 per month for employees we do not have, and do not plan on getting for the next 12 Months, we wanted to find out if there was a way to possibly just reduce our head count back to 9. We figured we could just go back to Gusto with the rest of our employees, as they were always great and upfront about fees and cost. \n\nWhen we inquired about reducing our head count back to the original number, as we are a small business and cannot afford that extra cost per month, we were told that the  only way possible to do that is if we sign a 2-3 years additional contract with Rippling. We also were told that if we wanted to keep the employee count at 15, and just pay for the current number of employees we have, we would have to sign an additional 2-3 year contract to do so. \n\nSo apparently we are either stuck figuring out how to pay them an additional $800 per month for the next year, or stuck dealing with them for an additional 2-3 years no matter what happens with our business. \n\nI feel like Rippling is preying on my business and I don't know what to do. You can't speak to anyone by phone, only by email. What sucks about that is the person we've been communicating with only replies once every 24 hours, and just reiterates the same thing over and over again. I've asked legitimate questions as to why this is happening, and never get a direct answer. Worst part is the person I'm speaking to is an Account Executive with the company, so he is definitely trying to push us hard to sign this extended 2-3 year contract, even though we've only been with the company for 3 months. \n\nPlease don't make the mistake we did!\n\n\nTL;DR - Rippling baited and switched on us after being with them for 3 months. Payment for using their services went up over $800 per month unexpectedly on our 3rd month of using them. Rippling stated this is due to us having 25 employees at one point (started with 9, currently at 15), and that for the next 12 months our company will be charged for 25 employees whether we have them or not. The only way for us to be charged for the correct number of employees we have is to sign an additonal 2-3year contract with them, even though we just signed a 15 month contract with them 3 mos ago.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID icero9l with +97 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icero9l/) (in reply to ID vcfyu7):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID icff78j with +31 score by [(Rlvantage, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icff78j/) (in reply to ID icero9l):\nSmart!

After signing you went up to 9. If thier logic stands you shouldn't have to pay for the extra ee's.

I haven't seen anyone attempt to explain to you why your contract is structured the way it is. Everyone seems to just be acting like it's unreasonable. I'm not saying it isn't, but I'll add context from 20 years in managed services. \n\nYou engaged in a fixed fee contract for services. You should have signed a scope that explained the services that would be provided, options to scale up, and a term. You alluded to most of that in your op. Once you signed that, the company began work to onboard you into the technology, and subsequently hired people (account execs, help desk techs, sys admins, payroll professionals, etc.) based on having to support 9 users for your business for the next 15 months. \n\nThen, somehow, you restructured within 3 months, going from 9 to 25 employees and back down to 15. \n\nMost managed services companies deal with this in a handful of ways. \n\n1. They up your contracted number of users. Ie: they onboard new users for no upfront cost, and they hire additional personnel to meet the scope you signed originally. You can scale up, you can't scale down. \n2. They continue to bill for the 9, but t&m the shit out of you for everything else. Ie: you'd have probably paid several thousand for the amount of movement you had in 2 months. \n\nYou characterized this well when you said you made a mistake. You got into a managed services contract before you really had your business dialed in, and because you were unfamiliar with how they work, you're in a rough situation. \n\nMy advice: Tell the account exec in email that you did not understand the scaling terms in the contract, and that you do now. You're not going to pay them an extra $800/month for the next 12 months, but you would like to better understand how to avoid this situation for flux/temp staff in the future. If they have no options, execute whatever cancellation terms are in the contract, and inform them of your new provider. \n\nSide note: they're probably going to charge you to transition the services to a new provider. That work is usually not within the scope of the agreement. \n\nTL;DR - You oofed. Own it, look for reasonable resolution. Don't make the same mistake in the future. Exit if they can't be amenable to that.\n\n### Comment ID icg9tpj with +3 score by [(Rlvantage, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icg9tpj/) (in reply to ID icg4jq3):\nAppreciate the advice!

Glad to see you're reading all this stuff!\n\nRe: onboarding\n\nThere are two types of onboarding and offboarding activities. \n\n1. Onboarding of the operation - this is when you first start your relationship. The firm will come out and document all kinds of things about your operation that they need to perform their scope of work and roll out any technology tool sets that are required. This is either invoiced as a one time line item with a lower per user rate over the term of the agreement, or it is included in the rate over the term of the agreement. If it's included in the per user rate, that will impact drawdown schedules for early termination. Offboardings, likewise are not part of the service. Transfer of accounts, documentation, removal of toolsets, or decommission of assets. All of that requires labor not contemplated in the agreement. \n2. User/employee onboarding/offboardings - this is what happens when you hire/terminate personnel. Documentation updates, account provisioning/termination, workstation set up, training, etc. Non stable state activity. Again, some services may include these at different rates, or give you x amount of these per month/year for free, but you pay after. It sounded (and I could have this wrong) like you didn't have to pay anything when you ramped up to 25 users, you just had the higher rate.\n\nI couldn't find your email comment, but if they aren't willing to accept that you didn't understand the terms, and you do now, then move on.\n\nGood luck with your business!\n\n## Comment ID icej7s5 with +6 score by [(fernguitars, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icej7s5/) (in reply to ID vcfyu7):\nJust get rid of 'em.

For clarification for everyone, the way the contract works is if you add an employee, you are basically signing up for that license for the rest of the contract term (whatever is remaining out of the 15 months, where typically the first 3 were free.) That is an un-ideal situation if you are a seasonal employer and may peak during some months and then go back down. User licenses can be re-assigned, but you would need to terminate/offboard an employee before hiring a new one for that to work effectively. So it sounds as though as one time the poster did have a full 25 employees, but now has no use for the excess licenses.  We try to time our start dates if we know someone else is leaving to avoid being stuck with these dead licenses for the rest of the contract term. The quantity reset back down to the actual number of employees as the start of the next contract term, but I agree it is a deeply negative part of their contracts, especially when all services are stacked on top of each other, you end up having to pay for seats for every module whether you use them or not.  If you expect to have a highly fluctuating headcount, It would probably be best to stay away from Rippling or see if you can negotiate a different deal... but unlikely.\n\n## Comment ID kzvjg7s with +1 score by [(RudeEnd8411, Reddit, 2024-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/kzvjg7s/) (in reply to ID vcfyu7):\n**Does anyone have a phone number Rippling?

They help companies achieve SOC2 and other security/privacy certifications. The Vanta agent which gets installed on workstations collects a bunch of information about the configuration of your workstation and reports back to their platform, which is then used as compliance evidence for their regular audits.\n\nThe MDM likely doesn't do any tracking by default - they're there mostly to enforce certain configuration parameters (disk encryption, screen lock timeouts, etc). That said, it's trivial for them to be able to use the MDM to push out any other type of monitoring that is deemed appropriate by company leadership.\n\nI am not a fan of dragnet-style monitoring, but I have in a few cases, been asked by company leadership to perform some more detailed monitoring on a case-by-case basis - things like collecting browser history, etc. Once an MDM is installed, things like this are very easy.\n\n### Comment ID mjljs9w with +1 score by [(finish_thinking, Reddit, 2025-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/mjljs9w/) (in reply to ID jgmo3wn):\nI'd also agree that Vanta is pretty light weight.

Listing reasons below.\n\n1. Before even reading this, please read the reviews on [Blind](https://www.teamblind.com/company/Rippling/reviews) especially the ones for shit wlb, management, and culture.\n2. You won't be overworked as an intern(6-7 hrs daily for me), but you will **suffer** as a full timer. My mentor said multiple times hes worked weekends + 12+ hour days to get stuff done and said multiple times he's overloaded and \"dying\" (obv in quotes)\n   1. I've talked with multiple other teams about potential work and **all** of them looked like they wanted out and lost so much hair\n3. You think you're gonna learn stuff because its a unicorn? No fucking way here.\n   1. **Everything** and I mean **Everything** is based on output and getting shit done. No one gives a **fuck** about code quality and all you are is a code monkey.\n   2. There are multiple severe incidents a week and people have gotten fired for causing too many incidents\n      1. An incident where some IC helped => manager didn't like looking bad => the goddamn IC gets fired for helping FFS IMFAO\n   3. Oh yea no one gives a fuck about scaling here. We've lost a significant amount of customers because the product was too slow\n4. You know how Citadel has clawbacks for bonuses if you leave within the first year? Its kind of similar to Rippling but for ur paper stocks. Leave within 1 year and you get nada.\n   1. People have been fired before vesting in order not to pay out.\n5. Management is **draconian.**\n   1. If you're higher up and Parker/C Suite/EM's/PM's don't like you, you're out the door\n   2. Multiple good EM's have been fired\n   3. The new CTO is laying off EM's in order for his previous coworkers to come in and become the first \"VPs\"\n      1. We also fired our past CTO G.B. after a few months lol. Like a horse trying to lead donkeys on redbull to the moon\n6. Your manager does not give a **fuck** about you. You exist for your managers benefit and to look good. They can sideswipe you at any time.\n7. Ripplings RSU share prices given to new hires right now is absolutely overvalued.\n8. People in the India office are completly overworked(everything here is SF related however). Pretty common to see them online at 10-11pm. Was curious a few times late night and saw a few coworkers online at 2-3am.\n9. You may think hey there are no layoffs so it must be good like those overvalued startups.\n   1. We don't have layoffs we have PIPs and random firings instead\n10. You might think the wlb rating  [here](https://www.rippling.com/life) on their website is high and accurate you say?\n11. Those surveys they send arent anonymous. Disagree too much and you get fired. You don't need to include them in the data if they're fired rofl\n12. You think a \"high\" TC is better than all this? Here's the cherry on top\n13. Guess what the CTO doesn't believe in signing bonuses any more and RSU was reduced such that ur TC is around 20% lower. (230-250K tc => 190-210k tc \\[150 base is the same\\]).\n14. Go fucking work for Citadel pay if you want Citadel culture and management lol. No way 150 in base is enough to justify this shit.\n\n### Comment ID j6tqicc with +5 score by [(throwawaynoturtwin, Reddit, 2023-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zmyzdk/what_is_the_consensus_on_rippling/j6tqicc/) (in reply to ID j0eh1zo):\ncurrent FT, obligatory i think experience is very team dependent.

The shares cannot be sold (sometimes you can on equity zen, but does not seem guaranteed), so while you have $X worth of stock, you can't turn that into money.\n\nWhen the company stock IPOs two things happen: the stock can now be sold for cash, and (one would hope) the value of the stock increases. So people that were getting a bunch of 'paper money' (levels.fyi says EM's get about 600k per year) can now turn that into real money, assuming it vested, and if the valuation goes up so does your TC, effectively. A success story is Warby Parker, which seems to have doubled in valuation in the year leading up to their IPO: in this example, the EM's stock would go from 600k to 1.2 million.\n\nThis can go the other way though: sometimes stocks tank. If someone were to sign an offer at Roblox just preIPO (they direct listed, but still), 2/3rds of their RSU has now halved in price.\n\nTL;DR (because I am super rambly)\n\npre-IPO stock is not worth any real money, so companies give it out more freely. When the company IPOs, this fake money becomes real money, and now you have a lot of money.\n\n## Comment ID j0foi0v with +1 score by [(doubletagged, Reddit, 2022-12-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zmyzdk/what_is_the_consensus_on_rippling/j0foi0v/) (in reply to ID zmyzdk):\nIt is definitely not big tech/manga adjacent",

We have had constant issues with FSA and HSA contributions and employees are unable to contact them directly. We are also in Canada that has its own issues outside of the listed items.\n\n## Comment ID ln0hqdr with +7 score by [(Zealousideal_Lab_410, Reddit, 2024-09-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Payroll/comments/1fg8ct5/rippling_payroll_system/ln0hqdr/) (in reply to ID 1fg8ct5):\nYou should check out Workday\n\n### Comment ID ln3fcfj with +2 score by [(OddEmergency8587, Reddit, 2024-09-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Payroll/comments/1fg8ct5/rippling_payroll_system/ln3fcfj/) (in reply to ID ln0hqdr):\nWill do thanks!

I would NOT recommend Rippling for any construction, sub-contracting business AT ALL. \n\nIf your employees’ work includes multiple rates in the same pay period Rippling will not work for you at all. The reports are shit- they’re really just basic spreadsheets and make it difficult to look through if you have multiple jobs or projects codes. The demo people will promise you the world and deliver very little. Compared to other systems your account manager is very unhelpful. Most help needs to be through their chatbot and the chatbot WILL give you false information and once you speak to a real person you’ll finally find out what you want is impossible with Rippling but “that’s a new feature that will be available soon” \n\nI think the Time & Attendance app is nice and easy so it makes clocking in and out manageable for employees. You get lots of options on customization and workflow automations. Garnishments, reimbursements, deductions are easy to input especially if your health insurance is one that integrates with Rippling. \n\nDepending on your needs it could be a good system but we are moving back to our previous payroll system after 5 months with Rippling and couldn’t be happier leaving. We are a subcontractor who does PLA/PW/DB work so it’s not a good fit for us but could be for you.\n\n### Comment ID lnzk1qh with +1 score by [(OddEmergency8587, Reddit, 2024-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Payroll/comments/1fg8ct5/rippling_payroll_system/lnzk1qh/) (in reply to ID lnul80g):\nWe are in the support sector in heath care.

We're a US-based company with no international employees, but I can underscore the other comments here about the nightmare that is their tax setup / payroll reports and agency fees. Our company was charged over $3,000 just in 2024 for missing tax agency account numbers. \n\nDue to an issue with our previous bookkeeper, Rippling wouldn't file our employee W2s, year end tax forms and 941s, and then we had to negotiate with them to even get access to the data so we could file ourselves.... They blamed it on the fact that they bulk process tax payments and their developers hadn't built a mechanism to pull individual company data... big oversight IMO. Made it seem like they were doing us a huge favor by giving us access to the data we pay them (a lot of money) to prepare. \n\n  \nAlso underscoring the fact that Sales will promise A LOT of things that are \"coming soon\" before you sign a contract, then go pretty much MIA once they have your money.

I hope your supervisors note that this small company was a trial run with your payroll company. There was really nothing that has gone well with this trial run; the online platform was very difficult to maneuver, the customer service lacked knowledge and  did not follow through to finding an experienced agent to resolve the issues, the online instructions were severely lacking when forced to do myself, the lack of a customer service phone number is very frustrating (and also causes problems to go from a 6 hour problem to a 15 day problem, and now I am being charged for a correction that should have been done well before the w2’s were issued.

Rippling also has an automated system where you can automate your work process. For example, depending on the qualifying life event, an employees request for time off will trigger a string of emails & notifications to the appropriate team members. Same system is triggered when health insurance comes into play - especially useful when you have employees across the country.\n\nDown-side of Rippling: it's expensive. They continously upsell on all their 3rd party apps & upgrades. Customer service is not immediate either, especially when it comes to fixing tax related issues.\n\nIf you want something similar to Rippling, Paylocity is so much better & you ca speak with a human being ASAP when you need assistance. Rippling outsourced their summer service to outside the country, so good luck.\n\n## Comment ID m2q7a3p with +1 score by [(mandalayx, Reddit, 2024-12-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1glee9d/rippling_vs_bamboohr_na/m2q7a3p/) (in reply to ID 1glee9d):\nRippling is weird in the sense that you have to submit payroll by Monday for a Friday payroll.

Paper quality is critical to wc painting. Paint just behaves very differently.\n\nTape it down to a board before painting. That will prevent most buckling, unless you are doing very wet washes.\n\nYou can learn about soaking and stretching your paper before hand, and either stapling it or taping it, but it’s not really necessary, at least at this stage.\n\nRegular painter’s tape will do (although coloured tapes interfere somewhat with your pigment choices.) There is something called Artist’s Tape, but it is more expensive.\n\nBefore you use the tape though, stick it to your jeans etc 1-2x to remove excess glue. Then tape down your paper.\n\nWhen done and you remove the tape, keep it at a 45° angle and pull slowly. If there’s any sign of tearing, just use a blowdryer to heat up the tape as you remove it.\n\nHave fun!\n\n#### Comment ID j380390 with +3 score by [(BabyImafool, Reddit, 2023-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watercolor/comments/104hq4j/new_to_watercolor_how_to_block_paper_to_avoid/j380390/) (in reply to ID j35c39r):\nYou can also watercolor on some art canvas.

It’s like a watercolor sketch pad but instead of just the top/side being sealed to the spine, all of it is sealed down to prevent buckling. When it’s dry you just take it off of the pad and it’s much less bumpy than normal paper. The Arches watercolor blocks are 10/10. Lower quality watercolor paper or non watercolor paper will pretty much always do that though, regardless of whether you tape it down or not.

Arches will certainly do so.  Increasing the gsm will help.  That is a 90-lb paper will always buckle more than a 140 lb and a 300 lb paper will rarely buckle.\n\nThe art books for watercolor frequently are about a 90 pound.\n\nStonehenge Legion will very rarely buckle even at 140 lb.  Frequently cheaper than Arches because only 1 side is usable.\n\nTwinrocker 140 lb will not buckle but Twin Rocker is $17 for a 22\"x30\" sheet.  I'm still in learning mode, so this brand is out of my affordability.\n\nGenuinely stretching paper is a bit challenging but if you've got a technique down for that, even 90 lb paper won't buckle.  Basically you soak the paper until soft, then clamp firmly into place so it shrinks as it dries.  The clamping (or your preferred method) forces it to dry taut as a drum head.\n\n### Comment ID j37sg17 with +2 score by [(Old-Basil-5567, Reddit, 2023-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watercolor/comments/104hq4j/new_to_watercolor_how_to_block_paper_to_avoid/j37sg17/) (in reply to ID j35hkx9):\nIve done this like one does a canvas over a frame.

We are currently on a platform called Mosyle and it really isn’t working for us at this point. The system feels too juvenile and is too buggy and also feels super limited. Their security options also sucks, we need a full and capable EDR. \n\nRippling seems relatively new compared to Jamf which seems to be the leading competitor in this market. I have seen some pretty bad reviews with rippling but it all seems pretty outdated. Their current features look cool, and they’re also compatible with windows products so that is a huge plus for us in the long run. That being said Jamf of course looks great as well and even costs less. \n\nBoth platforms seem to be great options but I was wondering if you guys could share some of your experiences here. I’m overall looking for a platform that is easy to navigate, has great security options, and is easy to use for onboarding devices. \n\nSome other things I’d want to have is being able to assign credentials to a device ahead of time, being able to manage device passwords through a hub, tracking device activities, and remote capabilities. \n\nHopefully I was clear enough here, but I’d appreciate some help and insight from you all! \n\n## Comment ID mcoc88q with +10 score by [(ProZak27, Reddit, 2025-02-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/1iosx7m/rippling_mdm_vs_jamf_mdm/mcoc88q/) (in reply to ID 1iosx7m):\nDon’t use Rippling.

Its only going spread the oils from your finger around on the build plate.  Take some windex and clean the bed plate very good, once done don't touch plate. The oils from your fingers is creating the problem. Trust me on this. I do this trick after each print and I have perfect layers every time. I recommend also using blue paper towels.

      "# Post ID uwmxg4: Bad rippling along Y with +3 score by [(Arakon, Reddit, 2022-05-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/klippers/comments/uwmxg4/bad_rippling_along_y/)\nI'm getting severe ripples on the Y axis. Higher speeds make them space apart further. Anyone have any idea? This is with IS already active (pressure advance wasn't enabled for that print, so don't mind the blobby edges). It's a Tronxy X5SA with linear rails that I got used. All corners have metal brackets. The rails feel fairly smooth, X more than Y, but no obvious harsh bumps on any. I tried several different belt tensions, from floppy to nearly tearing the motors off.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1z0i8gy98e191.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bb1121f963ead576863caf021de506e951682d8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzsg3hy98e191.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bd3c2731c2daa6907c74d50befb517d0169da59\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5a9jil8f8e191.jpg?width=1561&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=56d0dfa79bdcfe58f8e080951e9f5e089faddc05\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o19xil8f8e191.jpg?width=1182&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=194b3b7f851759f7933c37d93d0ebe4745b7d1b9\n\n## Comment ID i9svlvs with +5 score by [(DopeBoogie, Reddit, 2022-05-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/klippers/comments/uwmxg4/bad_rippling_along_y/i9svlvs/) (in reply to ID uwmxg4):\nWow that's an impressively messed up cube!\n\nWhatever is happening here, it's not because of (or related to) Klipper.\n\nThis is almost 100% certainly a mechanical issue.\n\nCheck your belts and wheels are tightened and aligned properly (eccentric nuts baby!)\n\nThen (with the printer off) manually move it back and forth on each axis and feel for binding or grinding. You may have to do this multiple times from different positions. (Move the Y-axis to one extreme and then move X back and forth, then move Y to another position and repeat, etc. Pay special attention to the coordinates where this defect is occurring. \n\nMy guess is a belt or a wheel is skipping/binding in that spot and causing this effect.\n\n## Comment ID i9shkvp with +2 score by [(Explorer_Unlikely, Reddit, 2022-05-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/klippers/comments/uwmxg4/bad_rippling_along_y/i9shkvp/) (in reply to ID uwmxg4):\nPush the gantry in Y and see if x carriage moves to one side while you do that.

I did a complete teardown of the rails, de-greased and deeply cleaned, replaced the bearings,  repacked with the proper grease, this led to buttery smooth motion on both carriages, but once they were coupled together onto the bed, the motion wasn't as smooth due to minuscule misalignment between the both (you'll feel the waves happen if you lay your hands flat on the bed and slowly move it back and forth), so this led me back to realigning the rails by the slightest measurements along with less torque on the carriage screws attaching the bed. This, along with getting the belt tension just right, got these ripples to mostly disappear.  Very annoying process to deal with since the printer wasn't originally designed for rails, but I am now happy with the results. Hopefully some of this might help you.\n\n## Comment ID i9t60a5 with +1 score by [(IRIX-6, Reddit, 2022-05-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/klippers/comments/uwmxg4/bad_rippling_along_y/i9t60a5/) (in reply to ID uwmxg4):\nI would guess belt tension on the y.

Online version you can see tasks (maybe if you have a joint admin account not sure about regular users) the app does not feature a task icon on iphone or android, so unless you pay attention to e mails they give you to your work or personal email you wont know what tasks need to be done.\n\n3. The app learning management is different than online, feels a little too bunched up trying to do questionnaires and watch videos. \n\n4. The app sometimes for some users just logs them in, and it is up to the user to navigate and fill things out, making HR have to walk each employee through the process of on boarding. Needs better flow, maybe even call to actions to walk employees through onboarding each section.\n\n5. When it comes to loading documents, on android it has problems sometimes saying error when accessing camera to take a photo, you need to exit app take a photo and then use photo upload. \n\n6. It shows the entire company, and if you have your personal phone number uploaded on on boarding, it shows it to the company employees too. Some people dont want personal information like that available to everyone in the company and you cant manually change it otherwise the company wont have information for you either. \n\n7. Some companies do not issue work e mails, so \nIf you have a personal one, it wont show, maybe a plus maybe not?\n\n8. They have an emergency contact section but only for one person and one number, would be great to have up to 3 people and 1 mobile and alternate for both. Would be nice if it showed a relation field too so i could put mom, dad, uncle, cousin, s/o or something as well, if i call and that person doesnt know who i am to someone they may hang up. Better to start the call off indicating how i know them and who and why i am calling.",

          "content": "One star because payroll works, but wow this is the worst benefits software I’ve ever used. Recently had a situation where I needed to use my work’s COBRA policy and got no help whatsoever from rippling. Had to communicate with BCBS directly and fix errors made on rippling’s side. Unlike gusto or literally any other benefits company, you can’t communicate with any humans on Rippling’s side, which is infuriating to both the employee and health insurance provider. Who thought that was a good idea?? Having a dedicated HR person at your company doesn’t replace having someone at rippling if they don’t have access to what rippling does. You end up playing this game proxying communication through your HR person to rippling’s support team because they are the only ones able to get an actual phone number for humans on the other end.\n\nThat’s not the worst part - Eventually rippling’s website updated to show my policy and a few months later my health insurance was cancelled with no notification or warning! I had the pleasure of finding out I was uninsured when I went to go get a vaccine. As a matter of fact rippling’s website showed it was still good until Nov (this was in July) and they took no accountability to admit they were wrong when I verified it with BCBS. A little notice would’ve been nice. What’s great is I couldn’t communicate with any humans on rippling’s side! Literally no phone number, all communication is through your company’s HR person. My HR person didn’t know what was going on and assured me it was probably a glitch on rippling’s side since their website said the policy was still active. I couldn’t patch BCBS to Rippling to verify it was an error on their side because of the whole no humans thing so at the end of the day I was left without health insurance for a month while waiting for my policy on the private market to activate. \n\nRippling is a totally dishonest company that takes zero accountability for critical faults on their end. Come on rippling this isn’t a fun todo list app startup, it’s people’s lives. Put some humans on the phone…",

My experience was unfortunately very disappointing and short-lived.\n\nThe training program was severely lacking and did not align with industry standards. Despite my extensive background, I was only included in 4-5 meetings total before termination. During the very first meeting, my direct supervisor made negative assumptions about my potential performance before I had any opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities.\n\nThe workplace culture was concerning. My attempts to provide feedback on industry-standard practices were met with hostility. Questions asked during training were viewed negatively rather than as engagement in the learning process. Colleagues were dismissive of formal education in the field, creating an uncomfortable work environment.\n\nManagement was casual to the point of unprofessionalism. Despite having limited interaction opportunities, I was criticized for \"not engaging with peers\" while simultaneously being dismissed when attempting to contribute to professional discussions.\n\nThe company's business travel practices deviated significantly from industry standards, and any attempt to provide constructive feedback based on experience was unwelcome.",

We've been told for almost 2 years that \"career progression\" documentation was coming and it never does. There are very unfair (possibly illegal) hiring and promotion practices that rely strongly on favoritism. \n\nNo work life balance and job descriptions are not accurate. People are hired as EDI Analysts and then do a customer service role nearly full time. It's very strange to hire people to do one job and then ask them to do something entirely different.

Their actions set the cultural tone and significantly impact morale, reputation, and retention.\n\n-Develop clear, fair, and transparent territory assignment processes to provide equal opportunities for all employees.\n\n-Provide management training that emphasizes accountability for team success, employee retention, and morale. Acknowledge systemic issues instead of placing blame solely on individuals.\n\nGenuinely listen to and act upon employee feedback and concerns.

If partners don’t have clients actively needing solutions, your quota attainment and earning potential become severely limited, regardless of your personal effort.\n\n-Inconsistent territory assignments and unequal opportunities: Territory assignments feel random and lack transparency, creating significant disadvantages for some reps while favoring others. Success often feels like it's determined by luck rather than merit, with leadership not addressing the inherent inequality in opportunities.\n\n-Toxic and unprofessional leadership: Senior leadership regularly demonstrates unprofessional and disrespectful behavior, both internally and externally, including inappropriate language and publicly confronting competitors on platforms like LinkedIn. These actions harm employee morale and damage Rippling’s external reputation.\n\n-Zero work-life balance: Expectations for availability outside typical working hours are unrealistic and unfair, driven by the chaotic nature of the role and the lack of strategic clarity from leadership.\n\n-Complete lack of managerial support: When issues such as insufficient lead volume or inadequate SDR support are repeatedly raised, leadership either ignores or deflects responsibility. The common managerial advice is to simply \"send an email or make a call at exactly the right time,\" implying success is entirely dependent on luck due to their inability to define a clear path to success.\n\n-No job security: Employees have been openly replaced before being officially notified, creating an environment of anxiety, mistrust, and constant stress.",

Very transactional organization.\n\n100% inbound leads- they will eventually go to outbound which will change numbers drastically as no one “outbounds,” now this sounds great, but it’s luck of the draw with what inbound leads you get which dictates your number, most of the inbound leads are atrocious like a low level not DM taking the meeting for a Stanley cup. I’ve seen great sales rep get let go from just getting these atrocious leads, it’s truly luck of the draw. \n\nIf you’re looking for stability, Rippling is not the place.

On top of that, there's a strong collaborative vibe- Folks are willing to help and enable each other, even on a 1:1 basis, away from our many Slack channels.\n\nLast but not least, Rippling is able to count many well-known and up companies among its client base, and they are jam-packed with incredible end-users as well.",

The demand for quick results and constant change may lead to a high-pressure environment.\n\nWork-Life Balance Challenges: Due to the dynamic and ambitious culture, some employees may find it difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Long hours and the expectation to remain responsive can occasionally interfere with personal time.\n\nRole Ambiguity: As with many fast-growing companies, there may be some uncertainty about job roles and responsibilities, particularly in the early stages of employment or in newly created positions. Employees may need to adapt quickly to shifting expectations.\n\nHeavy Workload: Some employees report that the workload can be intense, particularly during peak periods. This can lead to burnout if not managed effectively.\n\nLimited Remote Opportunities for Some Roles: While Rippling does offer remote work options for many positions, some roles might require employees to work from the office, limiting flexibility for those seeking full-time remote opportunities.\n\nGrowing Pains: As a company experiencing rapid growth, Rippling may face some challenges related to scalability, including potential inefficiencies in processes, evolving company policies, and a lack of formalized structures in some areas.\n\nHigh Expectations: Rippling hires driven, ambitious individuals, and the high expectations placed on employees may not suit everyone. People looking for a more laid-back or less demanding work environment may find this culture difficult to adapt to.\n\nLimited Focus on Employee Perks: While Rippling offers solid compensation and benefits, some employees may feel that certain perks or initiatives, like wellness programs or additional employee benefits, are not as robust compared to other tech companies.\n\nThese cons are worth considering when evaluating Rippling as an employer, especially if work-life balance or clear structure are important to you. However, many employees thrive in the company's fast-paced and dynamic environment, so the experience can vary depending on role and individual preferences.",

They also have lots of office hours and extra training sessions, as well as Slack channels to help answer questions and further your knowledge.\n\nThe system is so user friendly that you and clients can figure out a lot on their own.

You are interacting with really smart people and teams on a day to day basis, and hence learning and growing.\n\nOpen and improved engineering culture: There aren't any boundaries on people to go and learn, major engineering projects are put in open for others to discuss and learn. The engineering team and culture has improved vastly in the last 2 years, with a lot of seasoned staff and senior staff engineers in the org.\n\nProduct and revenue growth: Rippling's clarity in what they want to build had been astonishing from day 1. Some of the products that we recently launched are things that comp any had in their plan from day 1. There is so much conviction and clarity into all the product and engineering investment that most of our products launched scale from 0 to few millions of revenue within their first year. The revenue growth has been astonishing, not derailed by many macro economic crisis. The revenue stream is diversified and proven to be resilient to so many external factors.",

If you care about upward mobility while also being able to be great at what you do, this isn't the place. \n\nRevolving door of senior leadership in product/eng up to the CTO, to the point where it's hard to feel like the caliber needed to really execute on the valuation will be willing to work here. We're at an inflection point where either executive leadership will exhibit a pivot from the small startup mentality to one that understands how to attract, retain and build top talent, or we'll stagnate and lose to the bigger companies that have already figured this out. \n\nFor an HR-focused company to have extremely uncompetitive benefits, no budget for teams to bond outside of work, etc. and no career development/enablement opportunities beyond true SMB is a bit strange. Like most high growth companies, the job is grueling and requires long hours and there's very little to offset that. For high performers, it's unfortunately extremely easy to find better opportunities elsewhere.",

At year-end, the pressure to deliver results is relentless, creating an extremely stressful environment filled with micromanagement and unreasonable demands. On top of that, the department supervisor is completely disconnected from the team’s reality, adding unnecessary stress and making the workplace feel more like a boot camp than a professional environment.\n\nThe engineering team, in particular, has been a major frustration. Instead of efficiently resolving tickets, they often send them back asking for additional information, creating unnecessary back-and-forth and delays. It’s been one of the most difficult teams I’ve ever worked with.\n\nOverall, I wouldn’t recommend this role—it lacks proper support, effective leadership, and a functional process for getting things done.",

I have talked to numerous people, friends in other departments, this company is particular who they pay well and generally don't pay the rest that well. \n- Implementation the worst attitude I've ever worked with. Working with some teams were nearly hostile in every interaction (rude, not helpful, blaming). CS too, very hot and cold, only friendly if you can benefit them but unwilling to help when you need something from them! \n\nClearly everyone is overwhelmed. I think it's sad when employees/leaders decide to blame and attack each other than find a productive solution to all of this. I think it's alarming for years this has been going on and management goes along with it, they're just as rude and to blame here. this is for management teams across all departments, like they're unapproachable and unwilling. \n\n- finally, the CEO.. do your research. The CEO created an illegal script which allowed the sales team to sell illegally. His company got sued and hundreds of people lost jobs for the negligence. It's a nearly identical replica of the current company.. The ceo, also hostile at times, a bad attitude and very protective of his engineers, which is great unless you're on the other side.",

I earned a bonus during this time but was told I conveniently didn't meet the threshold after I had quit Rippling.\n-Leadership doesn’t care about their ICs at all. Responding to slack messages at 2AM is seen as honorable and encouraged. Their “don’t care” attitude is very obvious to all who work for them. \n-I interviewed with a completely different team (except 1 person) than who I was actually going to be working with. I was told I was interviewing for a different position the whole time, then I was placed in a position I didn’t want after I had turned down other options. I also showed up and had a completely different manager on my first day, whom I had never met. \n-Rippling switched health insurance mid year. This left my son seemingly without coverage for at least 3 doctors appts, no idea how long it actually was. You have to message a PUBLIC slack channel to ask for insurance help in which you are told to “call blue cross”. I spent 3 hours on the phone trying to get my bills paid. \n-high turnover\n-lack of integrity - moving targets. \n-processes constantly changing at break neck speed, no one knows the true processes. \n-employees are not trained on certain product areas but then are thrown into calls or projects where they are supposed to be the subject matter expert. \n-Definitely the least integrity I’ve experienced from a sales team. This leads to implementation taking angry customers almost daily. This is a support role, not project management.\n-No acknowledgement for good work\n-High expectations, little reward.\n-PTO is almost not an option because you have weekly deadlines, and management makes it difficult for you to go on PTO purposefully by not helping you prep for out of office. So you have to awkwardly ask your colleagues for help or just opt out of PTO.",

Work-life balance can be difficult to maintain due to high turnover in the implementation department, often resulting in additional workload.\n\nMorale remains a concern, and there is a noticeable disconnect with the sales organization. The frequent turnover and assignment of implementation managers who may require further development in technical, project management, and soft skills pose challenges in maintaining a cohesive team environment. We did have an off-site though, and it was good to connect in person.\n\nThe recent departure of our VP of Implementation, similar to the previous VP's exit, has led to more concerns about the health of the organization. Unfortunately, this will lead to the promotion of a senior director who ultimately drove all of the senior managers and directors away over a year ago.",

I have talked to numerous people, friends in other departments, this company is particular who they pay well and generally don't pay the rest that well. \n- Implementation the worst attitude I've ever worked with.

I think it's alarming for years this has been going on and management goes along with it, they're just as rude and to blame here. this is for management teams across all departments, like they're unapproachable and unwilling. \n\n- finally, the CEO.. do your research. The CEO created an illegal script which allowed the sales team to sell illegally. His company got sued and hundreds of people lost jobs for the negligence.

There are HUGE communication issues that have been raised for years with no solution. Every time you bring up a systemic issue with managers, they have no idea what to do about it other than bring it to their manager. Then we hear nothing.\n\nCareer growth is abysmal. We've been told for almost 2 years that \"career progression\" documentation was coming and it never does. There are very unfair (possibly illegal) hiring and promotion practices that rely strongly on favoritism. \n\nNo work life balance and job descriptions are not accurate. People are hired as EDI Analysts and then do a customer service role nearly full time. It's very strange to hire people to do one job and then ask them to do something entirely different.

My experience was unfortunately very disappointing and short-lived.\n\nThe training program was severely lacking and did not align with industry standards. Despite my extensive background, I was only included in 4-5 meetings total before termination. During the very first meeting, my direct supervisor made negative assumptions about my potential performance before I had any opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities.\n\nThe workplace culture was concerning. My attempts to provide feedback on industry-standard practices were met with hostility. Questions asked during training were viewed negatively rather than as engagement in the learning process. Colleagues were dismissive of formal education in the field, creating an uncomfortable work environment.\n\nManagement was casual to the point of unprofessionalism. Despite having limited interaction opportunities, I was criticized for \"not engaging with peers\" while simultaneously being dismissed when attempting to contribute to professional discussions.\n\nThe company's business travel practices deviated significantly from industry standards, and any attempt to provide constructive feedback based on experience was unwelcome.",

Their actions set the cultural tone and significantly impact morale, reputation, and retention.\n\n-Develop clear, fair, and transparent territory assignment processes to provide equal opportunities for all employees.\n\n-Provide management training that emphasizes accountability for team success, employee retention, and morale. Acknowledge systemic issues instead of placing blame solely on individuals.\n\nGenuinely listen to and act upon employee feedback and concerns. Ignoring valid complaints will only exacerbate turnover and continue to harm Rippling’s future growth potential.",
        "cons": "-Severely misleading hiring practices: The expectations set during interviews—such as inbound lead volume, quota attainability, and team success rates—are vastly misrepresented, \n\n-Alarming turnover rate: Extremely high turnover across the team within a short period (nearly 100% in less than a year), clearly signaling major systemic and leadership issues rather than isolated performance problems.\n\n-Partner-dependent sales model: Your pipeline and overall success are almost entirely outside your control. If partners don’t have clients actively needing solutions, your quota attainment and earning potential become severely limited, regardless of your personal effort.\n\n-Inconsistent territory assignments and unequal opportunities: Territory assignments feel random and lack transparency, creating significant disadvantages for some reps while favoring others. Success often feels like it's determined by luck rather than merit, with leadership not addressing the inherent inequality in opportunities.\n\n-Toxic and unprofessional leadership: Senior leadership regularly demonstrates unprofessional and disrespectful behavior, both internally and externally, including inappropriate language and publicly confronting competitors on platforms like LinkedIn. These actions harm employee morale and damage Rippling’s external reputation.\n\n-Zero work-life balance: Expectations for availability outside typical working hours are unrealistic and unfair, driven by the chaotic nature of the role and the lack of strategic clarity from leadership.\n\n-Complete lack of managerial support: When issues such as insufficient lead volume or inadequate SDR support are repeatedly raised, leadership either ignores or deflects responsibility. The common managerial advice is to simply \"send an email or make a call at exactly the right time,\" implying success is entirely dependent on luck due to their inability to define a clear path to success.\n\n-No job security: Employees have been openly replaced before being officially notified, creating an environment of anxiety, mistrust, and constant stress.",

      "# [Rippling’s Parker Conrad on the company's new round, new SF lease and, also, its newest critic by Connie Loizos on 2024-04-22](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/ripplings-parker-conrad-on-the-companys-brand-new-round-its-brand-new-sf-lease-and-also-its-brand-new-critic/)\nLast week, TechCrunch broke the news that the workforce management software outfit Rippling was on the cusp of closing a new, $200 million round of funding at a hefty $13.4 billion valuation led by Coatue. We also reported that the round featured a separate, $670 million secondary component meant to give some of the company’s investors a bigger bite of the company, while letting Rippling’s employees — some of whom joined at the outset in 2016 — cash out some of their shares.\n\nRippling declined to comment at the time, but in an interview Friday afternoon, founder Parker Conrad confirmed our information, adding that the secondary component is actually a $590 million tender, with $200 million available for employees and $390 million available for seed and other investors.\n\nThe round, Rippling’s Series F, is also almost entirely an inside round. Coatue is an earlier investor in Rippling, along with other backers in this round that have been investing all along, including Founders Fund and Greenoaks. The only new member on the cap table is Dragoneer, a growth-stage investment firm in San Francisco.\n\nOf course, we were interested in much more than Rippling’s new fundraise, so while we had Conrad on the phone, we talked turnover. We discussed the company’s new office lease in San Francisco (right now, it’s the second-biggest lease to be signed this year in the city). Conrad also shared why Rippling is relatively “free” of AI. You can hear that full conversation in podcast form; if you prefer to read it, excerpts of that conversation follow, edited for length.\n\nSo why raise this money?\n\nHonestly, it started out as just an employee tender. We wanted to find a way to get some liquidity for early employees, so we went to market, looking really to do about $200 million for employees that wanted to sell some stock. [But] we got a lot of investor interest, so we expanded it first to include a small amount of primary [capital] — mostly as a way to get more ownership for investors that were looking to buy more — and then beyond that, we ended up expanding into seed investors as well.\n\nWhat does this secondary sale say about your plans to eventually go public? An IPO is a little bit in the distance?\n\nI definitely think it’s a bit in the distance, but it’s not like a way of delaying [anything]. If anything, it’s probably nice if there are people who want to buy a house or [want more cash] because life happens. It’s great to relieve some of that pressure before you go public so that you don’t have tons of people selling as soon as they can in the public markets.\n\nIs this the first time employees have been able to sell some shares?\n\nIt’s not. We did something in 2021. But it was smaller and the company was smaller, and it was a long time ago.\n\nDo you worry about employees leaving after cashing out?\n\nOne of the things that we talked about internally when we launched it was, we said, ‘Look, the first rule of an employee tender is that you don’t talk about the tender internally or publicly.’ We don’t want to see anyone spiking the football, or something like that. And the second rule of the employee tender is, ‘see the first rule.’ This is a very private, personal thing, and I’m thrilled for everyone [participating]; if this makes a difference in [their] life, that’s great. But it’s not the destination. The game’s not over.\n\nHow do you feel about turnover more generally? Some people don’t like to see it; other managers think it’s for the best. Elon Musk seems to be a fan, given the rate at which he turns over his executive team at Tesla.\n\nThe executive team at Rippling has been remarkably stable for a long time. A lot of the people on the team are people who I originally hired for those roles. Some of them are people I have long work histories with, even before this company. And certainly I always like to keep people. I mean, every once in a while, there’s an early Rippling employee who leaves the company, and I find it always just emotionally really sad when that happens, even if the company is going to be fine and they want to do something else or, you know, in some cases just kind of hang out. On a personal level, that’s always very difficult for me.\n\nYou newly leased 123,000 square feet in San Francisco for local employees, who are now back three days a week. How did you settle on that policy, and do you worry about retention or hiring?\n\nWe just think there’s an enormous amount of value of people being in the office together. We were never a company that was going remote. When we went remote temporarily during the pandemic, we said, this is for three weeks, and then we’re going back to the office. Of course, it was unfortunately a lot longer than that, but we were back in the office as soon as we could be. I think it’s possible for some companies to be fully remote, but it’s sort of like playing the game on hard mode. I think it’s a lot easier if people can get together in person; you get a lot done.\n\nIn the meantime, workforce management software is super crowded. You’re going up against a company that you famously co-founded and ran, Zenefits. There’s Paycor, Workday, Gusto, to name a few . . .\n\nThe weird thing is that Rippling is not actually a [human capital management] HCM company. Everyone who has been building business software believes that the way to build the best business software is to build these extremely narrow, focused deep products. And I think it’s completely wrong. I think the way you build the best business software is to build a really broad product suite of deeply integrated and seamlessly interoperable products. Yes, we have a very strong HR and payroll suite, but we also have an IT and security suite; we have a spend management suite, where we do things like corporate cards and bill pay and expense reimbursements. Actually, we’re using the primary capital that we raised in this round to fund the R&D efforts for a new, fourth cloud that we intend to launch in a completely different area.\n\nThe classic example of a company that builds software in this way is Microsoft. Microsoft is like the OG of compound software businesses.\n\nSpeaking of Microsoft, what is your “AI strategy”?\n\nWe are a company that is relatively free of any AI products right now. There’s some stuff that we’re working on. But I am always very skeptical of things that are, like, super trendy in Silicon Valley. So I can tell you what [our AI strategy] is not. I’m super skeptical of these chatbots. I don’t think anyone wants to chat with their HR software.\n\nI have to ask about a tweet related to our story about your new round. I saw [Benchmark general partner] Bill Gurley chimed in that “Anti-focus ain’t cheap.” I wasn’t sure if that was laudatory or a dig. Do you know?\n\nI assume given that it came from Bill that it’s a dig. And he’s not wrong that taking this opposite approach is expensive, particularly on the R&D side. If you look at Rippling financially, the thing that really stands out is how we spend on R&D. If you compare us to other HCM competitors — because you talked about the crowded HCM space — they spend an average of 10% of their revenue on R&D. Next year, Rippling is going to spend as much on R&D as [three rival companies] combined, and we have a much lower revenue footprint than the three. It’s definitely true that there’s a huge upfront investment phase in building what we’re building that obviously over time, as a percent of revenue, should come down. So he’s not wrong, but it’s a very explicit part of our strategy. What Bill might not totally understand is the benefit that you get from building software in this way; much higher upfront R&D costs [later result in] much higher sales and marketing efficiency.\n\nHas Bill ever done business with you?\n\nNo, I’ve never met Bill. He’s sort of a constant, low-grade antagonist, but I’ve never actually met him.\n\nI know he doesn’t get along very well with Marc Andreessen.\n\nThen Bill and I have that in common. Maybe we should meet up and grab a beer over that particular thing.",

      "# [Rippling Announces Series F Fundraising & Tender Offer by Parker Conrad on 2024-04-22](https://www.rippling.com/blog/rippling-announces-series-f-fundraising-and-tender-offer)\nWe’re pleased to announce Rippling has raised $200M in new financing, and signed agreements with investors to repurchase up to $590M of equity from current employees, former employees, and early investors. The financing was led by Coatue with participation from Founders Fund, Greenoaks, and other existing investors. Dragoneer is joining the round as a new investor.\n\nThe financing values the company at $13.5 billion.\n\nWe’re grateful for these investors’ conviction in Rippling, for the employees that have gotten us to this point, and for our clients, without whom none of this would be possible.\n\nRippling’s core thesis is that employee data is critical to a surprisingly large number of business systems, including the ones well outside of HR.\n\nMaintaining the fidelity of the same employee data across all these disconnected systems—effectively, across multiple separate databases—is the reason it’s a lot of work for companies to have many different business systems in the first place. Rippling solves this problem by giving companies and employees a single place to make changes, which then propagate everywhere automatically.\n\nThe system that does this isn’t just a time-saver—we believe it will be a critical primitive for business software going forward.\n\nProducts that are built on top of a rich graph of data about the organization, employees, their devices and apps aren’t just easier to manage. They are better as software products—with more intelligent workflows and approvals, better role-based policies and permissions, and more powerful analytics.\n\nThis system we’ve built helps companies run more efficiently and achieve their business goals faster than their competitors. We will continue to expand in new markets and invest deeply in R&D to enhance our current offering and build new products to support our clients.\n\nTo better understand Rippling’s approach and where we’re headed, you can read a lightly redacted version of the memo I wrote for investors ahead of this financing.",
      "# [16 Tax Deductions for Independent Contractors [2025] by The Rippling Team on 2024-07-23](https://www.rippling.com/blog/independent-contractor-tax-deductions)\nSelf-employed workers typically use their own equipment, find their own office space, and make their own retirement contributions. This all takes time. And costs money.\n\nThe good news is that if you're an independent contractor, sole proprietor, or another form of self-employed worker, many of your business expenses are tax-deductible.\n\nThese deductions, also known as write-offs, are subtracted from your taxable income, which lowers your tax bill. While a deduction won't provide a dollar-for-dollar refund for an expense, it’ll likely lessen the amount you owe to the IRS.\n\nIt pays for self-employed workers in the US to know what is and isn't tax-deductible. While you should consult a certified public accountant (CPA), attorney, or another tax professional to get a comprehensive view of which expenses qualify, consider this your starter guide, complete with common self-employed tax deductions to keep in mind and strategies for recording them.\n\n16 independent contractor tax deductions\n\nBelow, you'll find some of the most common 1099 tax deductions for self-employed workers, along with where to claim the expenses on your tax forms. This list is not exhaustive, and the exact provisions are constantly changing, so you should consult tax professionals and check the IRS' Self-Employed Individuals Tax Center for more information.\n\n1. Self-employment tax deduction\n\nContractors can deduct half of the self-employment tax from their net income. Since you're your own boss when you're self-employed, the IRS allows you to treat this tax as a business expense.\n\nPaperwork: Fill out a Schedule SE, then record half of the tax determined on Line 15 of your Schedule 1.\n\n2. Home office deduction\n\nIf you work from home, you can deduct some of your housing costs from your taxes. This includes:\n\nRent\n\nMortgage interest\n\nHome depreciation\n\nUtilities\n\nHomeowners insurance\n\nMaintenance and repairs\n\nSuppose you rent (rather than own) your home office space and quality for the home office deduction. In that case, you can deduct a percentage of your monthly rent equal to the percentage of your home’s square footage regularly and exclusively used for work. If your home office takes up 15% of your home, you can also deduct 15% of your annual utilities, like electricity.\n\nAdditional office-related expenses you can deduct include office supplies and furniture. If you maintain an office outside your home, incidental maintenance costs and a portion of utilities may also be tax deductible.\n\nPaperwork: The standard way to deduct your home office expenses is by filling out IRS Form 8829. Additionally, you can record home office expenses on Line 30 of your Schedule C. Record deductions for additional office-related expenses between lines 18 and 27 on your Schedule C.\n\n3. Cell phone and internet bills\n\nYou can write off the parts of your phone and internet expenses you use for your business. For example, you can write off any extra costs of long-distance business calls. You can also deduct the entire cost of a second phone line so long as it's exclusively dedicated to your business.\n\nWriting off internet use is similar. You can deduct costs associated with hosting a business website but not bills for personal internet use. Once you delineate which portions of your phone and internet bills are for business and which are personal, you can fully deduct the former.\n\nPaperwork: Business-related cell phone expenses go in Part V of your Schedule C. Internet expenses go in the utilities section on Line 25.\n\n4. Insurance\n\nHealth insurance. You can deduct your health, dental, and long-term care premiums so long as you're not qualified for a plan through your spouse's employer. If you have a spouse, children, or dependents age 26 or younger, you can also deduct health insurance premiums you paid on their behalf.\n\nBusiness insurance. You can deduct premiums for fire insurance, credit insurance, business liability insurance, and car insurance (if the vehicle is used for business).\n\nPaperwork: Health insurance costs go on Line 17 of your Schedule 1, and business insurance costs go on Line 15 of your Schedule C.\n\n5. Travel expenses\n\nYou can deduct travel-related expenses from your taxes if you have a specific, business-related purpose for your trip, which has to be outside of the general area of your home. This includes costs of:\n\nPlane, train, or bus tickets\n\nTaxis and rideshares during your trip\n\nBaggage fees (including shipping)\n\nCar expenses on your trip, including rentals, tolls, and parking fees\n\nLodging\n\nWhile you don't always have to pick the cheapest travel options, you should stay away from writing off any lavish expenses (e.g., booking a first-class flight) for your business trip.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 24.\n\n6. Advertising\n\nAny cost you put up to advertise your business is tax-deductible. This includes:\n\nOnline ads (like Facebook or Google)\n\nTV commercials\n\nRadio spots\n\nMail fliers\n\nBillboards\n\nThis also includes deducting fees from any PR or advertising agencies. You can also write off ads that encourage charitable giving that have your company's name on them.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 8.\n\n7. Meals\n\nYou can also write off half the cost of any meals from business-related travel. Other eligible meals include:\n\nLunch or dinner with clients\n\nFood from a business conference\n\nCatering for promotional events\n\nYou can deduct 50% of the actual cost of the meal with a receipt or take the standard meal allowance—which is pegged to the per diem for federal workers.\n\nPaperwork: Record your meals under travel expenses on Line 24 of your Schedule C.\n\n8. Vehicle expenses\n\nIndependent contractors can claim tax deductions for car expenses when they use the vehicle for business-related reasons, like driving to meet a new client or attending a seminar. Commuting to and from work is never tax-deductible.\n\nThe IRS sets a new standard mileage rate every year that you can record to figure out your deduction. In 2024, the rate is $0.67 cents per mile.\n\nWhile it's slightly more complicated, you can also figure out the percentage portion of business-related driving you did in the past year and multiply it by your car's operating expenses. For example, if you spend $4,000 on maintaining a car you used for work 20% of the time, you could write off $800. That said, there are significant record-keeping requirements for this deduction that you can learn more about here.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 9.\n\n9. Interest expenses\n\nYou can also write off any interest incurred from business loans, like business credit cards, equipment loans, and business lines of credit. If you take out a loan for business and personal reasons, you're only eligible for a deduction for the business portion. So keep careful track of where those funds are going.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that these deductions won't pay off all of your business-related interest. It's always better to pay debts off in full yourself as soon as you can instead of relying on write-offs.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 16.\n\n10. Dues and publications\n\nSelf-employed contractors can also deduct costs from trade magazines and journals directly related to their business—e.g., Graphic Arts Monthly if you're a web designer.\n\nYou can also deduct fees for belonging to groups related to your business, so long as they're not recreational (e.g., no country clubs). According to the IRS, these can include:\n\nBusiness leagues\n\nChambers of commerce\n\nCivic or public service organizations\n\nProfessional organizations (such as bar associations and medical associations)\n\nReal estate boards\n\nTrade associations\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Part V.\n\n11. Education expenses\n\nAny education related to your field of business is tax-deductible. You can claim credit on tuition expenses and get comped for webinars, online courses, and textbooks. But you can't write off any education expenses if you're pursuing a new career path separate from your current line of work.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Part V.\n\n12. Retirement plan contributions\n\nIf you're a self-employed small business owner, contributions to certain employee retirement accounts are tax-deductible. These include:\n\n401(k)s\n\nSimplified employee pension individual retirement accounts (SEP-IRAs)\n\nSavings incentive match plan for employees (SIMPLE) IRAs\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 19.\n\n13. Business licenses and taxes\n\nIf your business requires any special certifications (a real estate license, for instance), you can write off any associated fees on your tax return. The same goes for any regulatory taxes specific to your business.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 23.\n\n14. Business startup costs\n\nIn your first year of a new business, you can claim up to $5,000 in startup cost tax deductions from your taxes. This can apply to things like market research, location scouting, and attorney fees. You can also write off filing fees associated with setting up an LLC.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Part V.\n\n15. Equipment depreciation\n\nYou can deduct the cost of the wear and tear of your work tools as they age. The IRS requires that the eligible property be:\n\nSomething you own\n\nUsed for your business\n\nGoing to become obsolete\n\nExpected to last more than a year\n\nThe easiest way to calculate depreciation is by subtracting the equipment's expected value at the end of its life from its original cost while also determining how long you plan to use the equipment. There are other methods, and if you don't have expert accounting chops, you may want to seek the help of a professional.\n\nPaperwork: Line 13 of your Schedule C.\n\n16. Legal, accounting, and tax services\n\nTo keep track of all potential tax deductions from your business (and avoid any of the pitfalls), you should strongly consider soliciting help from CPAs, attorneys, or other tax professionals. These expenses are also tax-deductible.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 17.\n\n4 Tips for self-employed tax deductions\n\nThere are scores of tax write-offs that independent contractors and other self-employed workers can take advantage of. But if not done correctly, you run the risk of an IRS audit. So, before you make any big spending decisions banking on a tax deduction, here are some important guidelines to bear in mind.\n\nSeparate business and personal\n\nThe best way to improve your bookkeeping: clearly delineating business expenses from personal ones. Those lines are often blurred when you're self-employed.\n\nTax deductions are only for business expenses. You can't write off the cost of your bed because you messaged a client from it. The more you draw a clear line, the easier time you'll have claiming deductions. A simple way to do this is to have credit cards and bank accounts that are solely for your business.\n\nKeep great records\n\nProper bookkeeping makes deductions infinitely easier to claim come tax day—it's also your first line of defense in case of an audit. This means keeping and organizing receipts for anything you consider to be a business expense required to perform your line of work.\n\nSome deductions benefit from even more detailed record-keeping. For instance, if you're driving for business, you should record the date, mileage, and purpose of every trip. If you work out of a home office, you should have the dimensions of the workspace to calculate how much you write off.\n\n\"Is this an ordinary and necessary business expense?\"\n\nThis is the question you should always ask yourself before expecting a tax write-off—if the answer is yes, you can often claim a deduction. There are exceptions, such as capital expenses and the cost of goods sold. If the answer is no, the expense is likely non-deductible.\n\nAccording to the IRS: \"An ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in your industry. A necessary expense is one that is helpful and appropriate for your trade or business.\"\n\nThis means you shouldn't deduct any expenses outside your line of work. It also means that while you don't have to pick the cheapest possible options to claim a deduction (a motel stay on a business trip), you shouldn't pick any luxurious options (a five-star resort) either, as these will draw IRS scrutiny.\n\nPaperwork and deadlines\n\nIf you've made over $600 from a client, they'll send you a Form 1099-NEC by the end of January. This form will help you establish your gross income.\n\nSelf-employed workers use their own equipment, find their own office space, and make their own retirement contributions. It all takes time. And costs money.\n\nThe good news is that if you're an independent contractor, sole proprietor, or another form of self-employed worker, many of your business expenses are tax-deductible.\n\nThese deductions, also known as write-offs, are subtracted from your taxable income, which lowers your tax bill. While a deduction won't provide a dollar-for-dollar refund for an expense, it’ll likely lessen the amount you owe to the IRS.\n\nIt pays for self-employed workers in the US to know what is and isn't tax-deductible. While you should consult a certified public accountant (CPA), attorney, or another tax professional to get a comprehensive view of which expenses qualify, consider this your starter guide, complete with common write-offs to keep in mind and strategies for recording them.\n\nThe best way to send tax documents (and payments) to contractors\n\nContractors already face uphill battles filing their own quarterly taxes and documenting their own expenses for write-offs. The task is even trickier when clients are slow to send out 1099s and other forms that help them determine their taxable income.",

      "# [Rippling Rolls Out AI-Powered Employee Evaluation Tool by PYMNTS, www.facebook.com on 2024-09-25](https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2024/rippling-rolls-out-ai-powered-employee-evaluation-tool/)\nWould you trust artificial intelligence-powered tools to conduct your employee evaluation?\n\nBusiness software startup Rippling hopes the answer is yes.\n\nThe company is launching a product called Talent Signal, which uses AI to gauge employee performance based on task-specific metrics, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (Sept. 25).\n\nThe tool can spot patterns a manager might not notice, helping companies better use resources while determining which employees may need fast-tracking or additional guidance, the report said.\n\n“In the ideal case, the manager would pull up a chair next to the employee and spend 90 days with them,” coaching them, said Rippling Chief Operating Officer Matt MacInnis, per the report.\n\nWhile few managers have time for that sort of effort, AI does, the report added. Those who have tested Talent Signal said the tool lets them set aside preconceived notions and look objectively as they evaluate an employee’s performance.\n\nMacInnis acknowledged some people might find the product unsettling, but it’s no less strange than a manager tracking a new employee, and it offers less bias, the report said.\n\nThe standard 90-day evaluation “can’t be about the vibe,” MacInnis said, per the report. “It’s got to be about the facts.”\n\nRippling’s workforce management platform combines human resources, informational technology and finance functions to create what it calls a “single source of truth” for employee data. The company raised $200 million in a Series F round in April that valued Rippling at $13.5 billion.\n\n“Rippling’s core thesis is that employee data is critical to a surprisingly large number of business systems, including the ones well outside of HR,” CEO Parker Conrad said at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, experts interviewed by PYMNTS have stressed the need for a balanced approach to AI that includes human intervention. Gillian Laging, co-founder of Scopey, a scope management platform, argued for built-in human oversight, pointing to her firm’s practice of having users review AI-drafted scopes of work before passing them on to clients.\n\n“This approach acknowledges that while AI can dramatically speed up certain processes, human judgment remains invaluable,” PYMNTS reported this month. “For instance, an AI might draft a comprehensive project scope, but a seasoned professional can spot nuances, potential issues or client-specific considerations that the AI might miss.”",

      "# [Rippling Launches Performance Management by People Center Inc. dba Rippling on 2024-05-08](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/05/08/2877869/0/en/Rippling-Launches-Performance-Management.html)\nSAN FRANCISCO, May 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rippling, the leading unified workforce management platform, today launched Performance Management. With Performance Management, Rippling customers can run global performance review cycles with 360º feedback, calibrate ratings confidentially, and run compensation processes including bonus payments. They can set up merit matrices and push changes directly to payroll. Rippling also supports year-round performance with triggered milestone reviews, goal setting, and soon, 1:1s.\n\nUnlike point solutions or legacy all-in-one systems, Performance Management is customizable to the business’s needs. And since all Rippling apps are natively built on top of the unified platform, clients can seamlessly connect performance data with other Rippling applications like Recruiting and Payroll as well as past cycle feedback and historical changes. As a result, reviews are always based on up-to-date employee attributes and can even be triggered at specific moments in the individual employee's lifecycle– all while ensuring complete control over who has access to performance data.\n\n“For HR leaders, unlocking employee talent is a top priority. But too often, they’re forced to design the performance management process around rigid, disconnected systems, rather than around the culture and the business’s needs,” said Darcy Mackay, Rippling’s SVP of HR and Client Services. “We want companies to stop managing spreadsheets and spend more time developing their people. Our Performance Management solution does just that.”\n\n“By removing the worry and arduousness of traditional review cycles, Rippling has helped us turn our performance management process into a strategic asset. We’re able to easily run an equitable, thorough, ongoing performance process for our team members and we’re already seeing the impact on our business,” said Laura Downey, LightForce’s HR Manager.\n\nRippling’s new Performance Management solution addresses the most common performance management pain points:\n\nAligning Employee Performance with Business Goals\n\nShared organizational goals are usually stored in a different system or locked in static documents, making it time-consuming to set and track an individual’s objectives and their progress against them. With Rippling, managers can quickly create goals, cascade them through their reporting line, and allocate ownership to specific members of their team. Likewise, instead of logging into a separate system, employees can review their goals regularly, using a system they’re in every day. And, because the Performance Management product connects to Rippling’s Employee Graph, business leaders can report on goal outcomes and trends alongside any other data in Rippling—including department, tenure, level and engagement surveys.\n\nLaunching Review Cycles\n\nTraditionally, launching a review cycle takes hours of manual work, especially if any customization is required. Because Rippling already understands a company’s roles and reporting structures, set-up is simplified and customization is painless. For example, you can create a full 360º review with upward, downward, and peer reviews. Within that cycle, you can decide how many peer reviews you want for each employee, specify unique questions for each department or reviewer, and even set rules about who should do the review if an employee transitioned managers during the review period.\n\nManaging Calibrations\n\nEnsuring reviews are consistent and fair usually requires hours of meetings and a plethora of spreadsheets– both in an effort to make sure no manager can view sensitive reviews and ratings information outside their scope. Because Rippling is built around one central source of truth for your organization, the system already knows which managers and HR business partners should have access to which employees’ information. It automatically handles all permissions, allowing appropriate managers and HR to compare and calibrate ratings directly in the app in either tabular or graphical format without having to use a single spreadsheet, eliminating the risk of confidential information falling into the wrong hands.\n\nStreamlining Compensation & Rewards\n\nAfter a typical review cycle, companies struggle not only with defining rewards schedules but also with sticking to their overall budget. Once compensation decisions are made, propagating those changes to a payroll system in an error-free manner is, at best, difficult and at worst, not even possible. This process often takes significant time after a review cycle, requiring endless spreadsheets and analysts to complete, resulting in review processes that can take many months to complete.\n\nRippling streamlines this entire process with built-in, customizable merit matrices, a real-time multi-currency view of a company’s overall rewards budget and dynamic policies that ensure an equitable process to help retain talent. This means any merit or level changes reflect automatically across the system, including payroll.\n\nConnecting Everything Together\n\nThe problem of disconnected systems is widespread. More than half of HR teams use seven or more point solutions. Legacy all-in-one systems, on the other hand, may share a common interface, but they lack configurability, preventing HR teams from tailoring review cycles to meet their particular organization’s needs. Often, privacy and data protection concerns are to blame for the fragmentation. But with Rippling’s Employee Graph at the core of every one of its products, including Performance Management, permissioning is already built in.\n\nAbout Rippling\n\nRippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance—globally. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, identity & access management, and device management. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.\n\nBased in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1.4B from the world's top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, and Bedrock.\n\nFor more information, visit Rippling.com.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nKristina Leal\n\nFirebrand Communications for Rippling\n\n415.848.9175\n\nrippling@firebrand.marketing"
