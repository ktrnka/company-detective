You had all these dreams of being a leader, with a seat at the table, driving real change.\n\nBut things haven’t turned out quite like you planned. You’ve been stuck in a relationship that’s been holding you back.\n\nOver the years you’ve made excuses for it. “Maybe this is how it’s supposed to be.” “Everyone else seems to put up with it.” “They say relationships take a lot of work.”\n\nBut let’s get one thing straight: It’s not you. It’s your HR software.\n\nIt doesn’t respect your time. It takes hours and hours of manual work just to get simple things done. And then there are the empty promises. “We’re always improving.” Oh yeah? When’s the last time it shipped a new product for you? 2019? Your work friends hate it, too. Sorry. They won’t say it, but they find your software inaccessible and off-putting.\n\nWe’re only bringing this up, because we think you could do better.

      "# Worthless Junk, Please Fix, 1 stars [(Bdfinlay, Apple App Store, 2023-06-08)](https://apple/10012130182)\nLogin on the mobile app doesn’t work, at all. And worse, two factor auth requires the user to leave the app and dig up the code from an authenticator app, then manually enter into Rippling. Why SMS or notifications haven’t been implemented for this I have no idea. But regardless, after entering valid creds the auth screen just closes and redirects the user back to the login screen. Attempting the same steps again gives the same results. In short, the app is completely broken and useless.",

It does not automatically update rates nor do they check to make sure that the agency they are paying taxes to is correct. My (now ex) accountant set the system up, did not give me total access, and then the Rippling system did not actually look into verifying any information. The other issue we had was that taxes were not paid on time A LOT *or* to the wrong agency *or* (this one is impressive) to the wrong account. How is this company even legal?? On top of that nothing is intuitive on their platform- I don’t think the developers have ever actually ran payroll based on how this app is laid our.

      "# Post ID vcfyu7: I chose Rippling and highly regret it with +250 score by [(Rlvantage, Reddit, 2022-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/)\nThis is actually my first post here, but you guys are an amazing, helpful community and I wanted to share my experience so others are aware of how r/Rippling operates. I did my research before choosing Rippling, but apparently not enough. I went over my contract in depth before signing with Rippling, but apparently not good enough. Hopefully by reading my cautionary tale, I can prevent someone from making the same mistake. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nWe started with Rippling in March, and at first everything was going great. They actually have a really good setup to streamline the HR side of things with small businesses, and have some good extra technology features (for a cost) that I have not seen similar companies offer. We had 9 employees to start, and were told that Rippling charges per employee per month. So if at any time we hired more employees, we would obviously pay more that month for the additonal employees, which we were fine with. After several Zoom sessions with our Account Executive, we signed a 15mos contract.\n\nSince March we have gained and lost employees (due to us re-structuring the company), leaving our current total number of employees at 15. Well this month we were charged $800 more than what our usual bill is. When we reached out because we were obviously confused, we were told the higher charge was because Rippling is charging us for the number of employees we have, which is 25. We quickly said no that is not correct, we only have 15 employees. To which the response from Rippling was, \"well you once had 25 employees, so you need to continue to pay for 25 employees even if you don't have 25 employees\". \n\nWell seeing how Rippling is now telling us we have to pay an extra $800 per month for employees we do not have, and do not plan on getting for the next 12 Months, we wanted to find out if there was a way to possibly just reduce our head count back to 9. We figured we could just go back to Gusto with the rest of our employees, as they were always great and upfront about fees and cost. \n\nWhen we inquired about reducing our head count back to the original number, as we are a small business and cannot afford that extra cost per month, we were told that the  only way possible to do that is if we sign a 2-3 years additional contract with Rippling. We also were told that if we wanted to keep the employee count at 15, and just pay for the current number of employees we have, we would have to sign an additional 2-3 year contract to do so. \n\nSo apparently we are either stuck figuring out how to pay them an additional $800 per month for the next year, or stuck dealing with them for an additional 2-3 years no matter what happens with our business. \n\nI feel like Rippling is preying on my business and I don't know what to do. You can't speak to anyone by phone, only by email. What sucks about that is the person we've been communicating with only replies once every 24 hours, and just reiterates the same thing over and over again. I've asked legitimate questions as to why this is happening, and never get a direct answer. Worst part is the person I'm speaking to is an Account Executive with the company, so he is definitely trying to push us hard to sign this extended 2-3 year contract, even though we've only been with the company for 3 months. \n\nPlease don't make the mistake we did!\n\n\nTL;DR - Rippling baited and switched on us after being with them for 3 months. Payment for using their services went up over $800 per month unexpectedly on our 3rd month of using them. Rippling stated this is due to us having 25 employees at one point (started with 9, currently at 15), and that for the next 12 months our company will be charged for 25 employees whether we have them or not. The only way for us to be charged for the correct number of employees we have is to sign an additonal 2-3year contract with them, even though we just signed a 15 month contract with them 3 mos ago.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID icero9l with +95 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icero9l/) (in reply to ID vcfyu7):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID icff78j with +32 score by [(Rlvantage, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icff78j/) (in reply to ID icero9l):\nSmart!

After signing you went up to 9. If thier logic stands you shouldn't have to pay for the extra ee's. If they want to charge you more then they need to produce a new contract at that point you can tell them they don't meet your needs anymore.

There are always lessons to be learned in business, and this lesson is challenging and complicated and I absolutely hate it. But ultimately it will help us moving forward so we can hopefully avoid anything close to this happening in the future.\n\nAlso, I originally made this post so if someone else down the road uses this sub like I do for research and feedback, they would be able to at least have a warning of what could happen if they considered going with Rippling.

For example: a money back guarantee for 30 days, but they respond to you with vague emails 2 or 3 times during the span of three weeks. There's no way to call them, no way of contacting them except by email. \n\nYou're just wasting time and they know that. \n\nBottom line, stop thinking about it and get legal help.

I haven't seen anyone attempt to explain to you why your contract is structured the way it is. Everyone seems to just be acting like it's unreasonable. I'm not saying it isn't, but I'll add context from 20 years in managed services. \n\nYou engaged in a fixed fee contract for services. You should have signed a scope that explained the services that would be provided, options to scale up, and a term. You alluded to most of that in your op. Once you signed that, the company began work to onboard you into the technology, and subsequently hired people (account execs, help desk techs, sys admins, payroll professionals, etc.) based on having to support 9 users for your business for the next 15 months. \n\nThen, somehow, you restructured within 3 months, going from 9 to 25 employees and back down to 15. \n\nMost managed services companies deal with this in a handful of ways. \n\n1. They up your contracted number of users. Ie: they onboard new users for no upfront cost, and they hire additional personnel to meet the scope you signed originally. You can scale up, you can't scale down. \n2. They continue to bill for the 9, but t&m the shit out of you for everything else. Ie: you'd have probably paid several thousand for the amount of movement you had in 2 months. \n\nYou characterized this well when you said you made a mistake. You got into a managed services contract before you really had your business dialed in, and because you were unfamiliar with how they work, you're in a rough situation. \n\nMy advice: Tell the account exec in email that you did not understand the scaling terms in the contract, and that you do now. You're not going to pay them an extra $800/month for the next 12 months, but you would like to better understand how to avoid this situation for flux/temp staff in the future. If they have no options, execute whatever cancellation terms are in the contract, and inform them of your new provider. \n\nSide note: they're probably going to charge you to transition the services to a new provider. That work is usually not within the scope of the agreement. \n\nTL;DR - You oofed. Own it, look for reasonable resolution. Don't make the same mistake in the future. Exit if they can't be amenable to that.\n\n### Comment ID icg9tpj with +3 score by [(Rlvantage, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icg9tpj/) (in reply to ID icg4jq3):\nAppreciate the advice!

Glad to see you're reading all this stuff!\n\nRe: onboarding\n\nThere are two types of onboarding and offboarding activities. \n\n1. Onboarding of the operation - this is when you first start your relationship. The firm will come out and document all kinds of things about your operation that they need to perform their scope of work and roll out any technology tool sets that are required. This is either invoiced as a one time line item with a lower per user rate over the term of the agreement, or it is included in the rate over the term of the agreement. If it's included in the per user rate, that will impact drawdown schedules for early termination. Offboardings, likewise are not part of the service. Transfer of accounts, documentation, removal of toolsets, or decommission of assets. All of that requires labor not contemplated in the agreement. \n2. User/employee onboarding/offboardings - this is what happens when you hire/terminate personnel. Documentation updates, account provisioning/termination, workstation set up, training, etc. Non stable state activity. Again, some services may include these at different rates, or give you x amount of these per month/year for free, but you pay after. It sounded (and I could have this wrong) like you didn't have to pay anything when you ramped up to 25 users, you just had the higher rate.\n\nI couldn't find your email comment, but if they aren't willing to accept that you didn't understand the terms, and you do now, then move on.\n\nGood luck with your business!\n\n## Comment ID icej7s5 with +7 score by [(fernguitars, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icej7s5/) (in reply to ID vcfyu7):\nJust get rid of 'em. Number one rule in business is when someone screws up or screws around with the money, there are no second chances.

For clarification for everyone, the way the contract works is if you add an employee, you are basically signing up for that license for the rest of the contract term (whatever is remaining out of the 15 months, where typically the first 3 were free.) That is an un-ideal situation if you are a seasonal employer and may peak during some months and then go back down. User licenses can be re-assigned, but you would need to terminate/offboard an employee before hiring a new one for that to work effectively. So it sounds as though as one time the poster did have a full 25 employees, but now has no use for the excess licenses.  We try to time our start dates if we know someone else is leaving to avoid being stuck with these dead licenses for the rest of the contract term. The quantity reset back down to the actual number of employees as the start of the next contract term, but I agree it is a deeply negative part of their contracts, especially when all services are stacked on top of each other, you end up having to pay for seats for every module whether you use them or not.  If you expect to have a highly fluctuating headcount, It would probably be best to stay away from Rippling or see if you can negotiate a different deal... but unlikely.\n\n## Comment ID kzvjg7s with +1 score by [(RudeEnd8411, Reddit, 2024-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/kzvjg7s/) (in reply to ID vcfyu7):\n**Does anyone have a phone number Rippling?

That does mean that the count could be different than the actual number of people working.  That does not sound like a Rippling Issue to me.  When you restructure there are costs and those are part of the costs.    At least if you are actually paying them each month.

They help companies achieve SOC2 and other security/privacy certifications. The Vanta agent which gets installed on workstations collects a bunch of information about the configuration of your workstation and reports back to their platform, which is then used as compliance evidence for their regular audits.\n\nThe MDM likely doesn't do any tracking by default - they're there mostly to enforce certain configuration parameters (disk encryption, screen lock timeouts, etc). That said, it's trivial for them to be able to use the MDM to push out any other type of monitoring that is deemed appropriate by company leadership.\n\nI am not a fan of dragnet-style monitoring, but I have in a few cases, been asked by company leadership to perform some more detailed monitoring on a case-by-case basis - things like collecting browser history, etc. Once an MDM is installed, things like this are very easy.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID jgnl5rp with +1 score by [(alephthirteen, Reddit, 2023-04-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/jgnl5rp/) (in reply to ID 12pi5k6):\nTL;DR Getting a tablet or Chromebook or even a new MacBook Air to browse the web is going to be way cheaper and less disruptive to your life than ***getting a new job***. Don't think about how likely it is they'll catch you. That's the wrong framework. Think about whether being fired would be a hassle. I imagine it would be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like you are in a remote work situation? They probably aren't filming your house--some companies do demand the webcam stays on, but not many--but everything on the device should be **assumed** to be company monitored. Their money, after all.\n\n\\- They quite possibly can see your web history. Not via the MDM itself, but any number of VPNs or filtering softwares do this.- They almost certainly can tell what apps you install.- Whatever security/endpoint software they install could have tons of other capabilities, too. Keystroke monitoring, logging what devices you plug in, etc.\n\nI'm in IT and the guy in charge of keeping the Macs compliant, so I need to be walking the walk. I'm a big fan of watching a YouTube or two in the breakroom over lunch, so people don't chase me down for tickets. I put my iPad in my bag and leave it off until I'm at lunch, put my phone in hotspot, then pull up whatever and watch it. Full division. Not their WiFi network. Not their gear. No one disturbed (except perhaps by my weird laugh).\n\nIf it's something that needs something more power than say, a basic iPad, Android tablet or Chromebook can do, I'd recommend you take a step back and think again, not about whether they'll catch you but whether you should be doing it on company time. Pull out your phone and make a note of the URL if it's a cool article you want to read, then read it later. If it's music, do it on your phone. Other things, maybe just do it after work.\n\nBut I wouldn't be doing Photoshop freelancing or playing Civ 6 or development in Docker containers or whatever on company time, and I can't think what else might need that much power. Most things that might be legit background stuff for WFH could also be done by your phone.\n\nIf you're freelancing, first, check if your contract allows it. And if your contract allows it, you should ***absolutely not*** be doing that on hardware they paid for.\n\n## Comment ID jgoibku with +1 score by [(slykido999, Reddit, 2023-04-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/jgoibku/) (in reply to ID 12pi5k6):\nIf ever you’re concerned about what IT can do to the computer you’re using, you should do it on your own personally owned computer without MDM.\n\n## Comment ID k08fcay with +1 score by [(ratatouille_artist, Reddit, 2023-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/k08fcay/) (in reply to ID 12pi5k6):\nI just installed Vanta myself and luckily it doesn't seem too intrusive.

Listing reasons below.\n\n1. Before even reading this, please read the reviews on [Blind](https://www.teamblind.com/company/Rippling/reviews) especially the ones for shit wlb, management, and culture.\n2. You won't be overworked as an intern(6-7 hrs daily for me), but you will **suffer** as a full timer. My mentor said multiple times hes worked weekends + 12+ hour days to get stuff done and said multiple times he's overloaded and \"dying\" (obv in quotes)\n   1. I've talked with multiple other teams about potential work and **all** of them looked like they wanted out and lost so much hair\n3. You think you're gonna learn stuff because its a unicorn? No fucking way here.\n   1. **Everything** and I mean **Everything** is based on output and getting shit done. No one gives a **fuck** about code quality and all you are is a code monkey.\n   2. There are multiple severe incidents a week and people have gotten fired for causing too many incidents\n      1. An incident where some IC helped => manager didn't like looking bad => the goddamn IC gets fired for helping FFS IMFAO\n   3. Oh yea no one gives a fuck about scaling here. We've lost a significant amount of customers because the product was too slow\n4. You know how Citadel has clawbacks for bonuses if you leave within the first year? Its kind of similar to Rippling but for ur paper stocks. Leave within 1 year and you get nada.\n   1. People have been fired before vesting in order not to pay out.\n5. Management is **draconian.**\n   1. If you're higher up and Parker/C Suite/EM's/PM's don't like you, you're out the door\n   2. Multiple good EM's have been fired\n   3. The new CTO is laying off EM's in order for his previous coworkers to come in and become the first \"VPs\"\n      1. We also fired our past CTO G.B. after a few months lol. Like a horse trying to lead donkeys on redbull to the moon\n6. Your manager does not give a **fuck** about you. You exist for your managers benefit and to look good. They can sideswipe you at any time.\n7. Ripplings RSU share prices given to new hires right now is absolutely overvalued.\n8. People in the India office are completly overworked(everything here is SF related however). Pretty common to see them online at 10-11pm. Was curious a few times late night and saw a few coworkers online at 2-3am.\n9. You may think hey there are no layoffs so it must be good like those overvalued startups.\n   1. We don't have layoffs we have PIPs and random firings instead\n10. You might think the wlb rating  [here](https://www.rippling.com/life) on their website is high and accurate you say?\n11. Those surveys they send arent anonymous. Disagree too much and you get fired. You don't need to include them in the data if they're fired rofl\n12. You think a \"high\" TC is better than all this? Here's the cherry on top\n13. Guess what the CTO doesn't believe in signing bonuses any more and RSU was reduced such that ur TC is around 20% lower. (230-250K tc => 190-210k tc \\[150 base is the same\\]).\n14. Go fucking work for Citadel pay if you want Citadel culture and management lol. No way 150 in base is enough to justify this shit.\n\n### Comment ID j6tqicc with +6 score by [(throwawaynoturtwin, Reddit, 2023-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zmyzdk/what_is_the_consensus_on_rippling/j6tqicc/) (in reply to ID j0eh1zo):\ncurrent FT, obligatory i think experience is very team dependent.

The shares cannot be sold (sometimes you can on equity zen, but does not seem guaranteed), so while you have $X worth of stock, you can't turn that into money.\n\nWhen the company stock IPOs two things happen: the stock can now be sold for cash, and (one would hope) the value of the stock increases. So people that were getting a bunch of 'paper money' (levels.fyi says EM's get about 600k per year) can now turn that into real money, assuming it vested, and if the valuation goes up so does your TC, effectively. A success story is Warby Parker, which seems to have doubled in valuation in the year leading up to their IPO: in this example, the EM's stock would go from 600k to 1.2 million.\n\nThis can go the other way though: sometimes stocks tank. If someone were to sign an offer at Roblox just preIPO (they direct listed, but still), 2/3rds of their RSU has now halved in price.\n\nTL;DR (because I am super rambly)\n\npre-IPO stock is not worth any real money, so companies give it out more freely. When the company IPOs, this fake money becomes real money, and now you have a lot of money.\n\n## Comment ID j0foi0v with +1 score by [(doubletagged, Reddit, 2022-12-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zmyzdk/what_is_the_consensus_on_rippling/j0foi0v/) (in reply to ID zmyzdk):\nIt is definitely not big tech/manga adjacent",

Today we'll be continuing the technique discussion series with Ophelia's Rippling Sword!

Actually I was under the impression (and for a very long time) that it may have worked like a sort of electric chainsaw technique in the way the sword could vibrate, and therefore it would also give it an improved cutting aspect. Now that I read these panels again more carefully, it's definitely not the point, and as correctly pointed out in the OP, it works more in the vein or principle of the undulating illusion, indeed similar to the \"rubber pencil trick\".\n\nI wonder if I was the only one under this impression? Anyway, it's a tricky technique, specially  for someone like Clare when she faced Ophelia... not only was Ophelia much stronger for Clare to handle, she had a pretty big counter-move for Clare's ace at the time (her pre-emptive yoki detection).\n\nThe technique on the whole seems quite strong, according to the databooks, it has a mid-moderate to high yoki input (45-66%) and is almost dead center in the graph of speed and power (or more towards power if looking at the pointers). Compared to other similar techniques in the databook graph, It was comparatively stronger and faster than Clare's own Quicksword pre-timeskip, but lagged behind Flora's Windcutter (both aspects), Irene's Quicksword (much slower but about the same in power) and Clare's combined Quicksword + Pre-emptive yoki detection (in both aspects).\n\nI'd say the advantages of the technique are a) very effective against orthodox or simple/normal sword strikes, blocks and parries due to the circumventing nature of the rippling or undulating strike; b) it can catch anyone with no previous knowledge quite off-guard; c) as the case with Clare, it can work really well against opponents who have the particular fighting style of using or relying heavily on their senses. \n\nBasically the closer you allow or let Ophelia continuously engage with that kind of movement, the more advantageous her position will be. In that sense the technique also reminds of a snake, that sticks close and gradually suffocates its victim to death. That would go for advantage d) I guess and also the ideal combat condition for it: an edge thus for very close exchanges. If the move isn't conclusive, the contiual exchanges and defense penetrating strikes would eventually weigh on the receiving end of the Rippling Sword.\n\nWith all that said, I also think the technique is counterable. And it may not necessarily take another fanciful technique like the Quicksword to do it.\n\nThe first way is by out-reaching it, however that may be. Awakened beings can easily do this by using their multitude of elongating appendages, and some techniques can have a better range/reach than others. I think the reason the Quicksword is able to counter Ophelia's Rippling Sword is not because it's necessarily \"superior\" in some sense, but because it can certainly out-reach it (either by range or by move initiative) so it avoids the penetrating effect where the Rippling Sword can be deadly.\n\nThe other way I imagine it could be countered, and using just simple sword strikes and swordsmanship skill  (granted it would probably take a very gifted or skilled warrior to pull it out), would be by trying to always guesstimate and target the contact more towards the tip or the extreme of the sword \"ripple\". In doing so and combining with a good adjusted range it could potentially repel the strike before it \"penetrates\" or not giving it room for the blade to slide. It would take a lot of adjusting too (both on range and strike contact) but that's when skill and experience comes in.\n\nAs for how the Rippling Sword relates or match Ophelia: as it was stated before and by others, in many ways the movement and technique reminds of a snake, and so does Ophelia. Ophelia's own awakened form is one that resembles a snake, snakewoman or lamia.\n\nOphelia is treacherous and a very predatory individual. Her atittude towards awakened, the way she sees them as her prey, the thrill she feels when fighting them, and also the way she often makes games and plays with her victims when they're completely overwhelmed is incredibly cruel and predatory. Surprisingly, that extends not only to awakened but also even to her own comrades and humans. Ophelia may be a victim in the grand scheme of things and a very traumatized person, but because of that she ended up becoming a very twisted and feared individual.\n\nLastly, another thing that striked me while re-reading these chapters with Ophelia, and that is something that's probably not limited to Ophelia but probably the most likely way most techniques are created, is that she actually sought to create the technique so she could make a name for herself, influenced by some of her contemporaries who already had one (Phantom Miria and Dark Alicia for instance). I find it interesting how Claymores actively try to create something that sets them apart, and gives them some sort of identity.\n\nAfter all, besides their purpose of ridding human of the plague of yoma and AB's, these are warriors that live for the sword and the battleground. This is their lives, their way... living among many of similarly groomed contemporaries, and countless others that have came before them. Things like the prestige of a high rank or the notoriety of a catchy and well justified moniker/nickname are pretty huge deals for these girls.\n\n### Comment ID cvp2bcr with +2 score by [(DekuNut, Reddit, 2015-10-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/claymore/comments/3mv9tn/technique_talk_tuesdays_rippling_sword/cvp2bcr/) (in reply to ID cvlkcwj):\nYoo sorry for the last response. I've been meaning to reply for a while but just haven't gotten around to it :(\n  \nInteresting first impression of the Rippling Sword! That would indeed be pretty devastating, and I wonder if the insane number of undulations per second wouldn't add some sort of additional offensive power your her blade.\n \nI'm not surprised at it's power/speed output according to those data books. Ophelia was strong, no doubt, and she developed the Rippling Sword purely for offensive. And being number 4, she obviously was comfortable pouring a moderate amount of Yoki into one arm to use the technique. But I felt that her technique was rather rough, as in, not optimized nearly as much as it could have been, like she thought of and created it within a day. So, it's strong and fast on the surface, but when compared to later techniques, or techniques created by other strong warriors, it lagged behind.\n \nIt's sort of like that one bandit's Falcon Sword, as it catches the unsuspected off guard (at least that's what I've always compared it to). I liked your comparison of the Rippling Sword to a snake's constriction! It's a shame the only two receivers of the technique were either much less skilled than Ophelia, or much more skilled. Though I think your interpretation of how a close fight would go is pretty good.\n \nOutreaching is definitely a good way to counter it. In fact, I think it's implied that Ophelia didn't create the technique to fight Awakened Beings, but rather those with swords...so she probably never took into account the weakness to ranged attacks. I see what you're saying about the second method of defense, too. Almost like using the sword's own momentum against itself. Thee is one warrior later on (Audrey, I think) who's main method of fighting is \"using her sword to reflect her opponent's attack using minimal strength to create a defense which counteracts her opponent's attacks. \" So I'd like to see a fight between Audrey and Ophelia!\n\nAbout your last point, that's a very clever observation. I suppose a large part of creating a technique that's all your own is to set yourself apart, make yourself known. When your in an organization where all your comrades are simply known by their symbol and ranking, having something that possibly reflects your individuality along with (literally making a name for yourself on the battleground...it must be a goal some strive to reach. I think part of it also is simply developing a technique to ensure your own chances of survival against enemies is increased.\n\n#### Comment ID cvpd6pj with +2 score by [(Rikugo, Reddit, 2015-10-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/claymore/comments/3mv9tn/technique_talk_tuesdays_rippling_sword/cvpd6pj/) (in reply to ID cvp2bcr):\nNo problem! I'm like that too sometimes, taking way too long to reply to some messages.\n\nYeah, even if it's probably innacurate looking at Ophelia's case, the effect I thought the technique had with that first impression would eventually be applied to Alicia's awakened form, with the small vibrating blades that add to her scythes cutting power.\n\nI also get a similar impression given the told story of Ophelia's Rippling Sword. Something that looks more designed to be shown to her fellow warriors (which in most occasions wouldn't bode well for them). The observation of how it's relatively ill suited against awakened beings is a good one. And Audrey is a good call, she would fit well with this second mold of warrior I was describing. Doesn't seem to have a very flashy technique (Soft Sword I suppose), but looks very refined in skill and focused on her swordsmanship. I think that would make for a very balanced contest, with Audrey having no qualms to hold back and show her craft and ability by adapting, adjusting and hopefully overcoming the Rippling Sword with her praised sword skills.\n\n## Comment ID cviertd with +1 score by [(mortal_sword, Reddit, 2015-09-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/claymore/comments/3mv9tn/technique_talk_tuesdays_rippling_sword/cviertd/) (in reply to ID 3mv9tn):\nHaha yes, I've been waiting for this!

If this is true it makes her far more impressive, and makes Ilena more impressive for blocking it.\n\nThe other possibility is that it simply slides under the opponent's blade by having her blade move liquidly around it... This logically makes more sense but makes less sense physically - her sword would have simply struck Clare's from the other side after \"slipping\" around it if it were vibrating so fast. We also haven't seen the swords be able to bend/break whatsoever so it's a littler unbelievable that Ophelia could do so.\n\n### Comment ID cviykms with +1 score by [(DekuNut, Reddit, 2015-09-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/claymore/comments/3mv9tn/technique_talk_tuesdays_rippling_sword/cviykms/) (in reply to ID cvigj3h):\nI *think* the trick with the technique is that the sword is making such quick, minute movements, that it only *appears* to be vibrating/moving liquidly.

(lbs or gsm)\n\nIf it is watercolour paper (100% cotton) it can be flattened. If not, I’m afraid it may not be fixable.\n\nAlso, heavier paper (300lb) doesn’t need to be taped. It will bend/curve, but it won’t buckle. Great for very wet or multiple washes. Expensive though and not really needed unless your technique uses lots of water.\n\n### Comment ID j35c39r with +11 score by [(ScarletAutumn_xo, Reddit, 2023-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watercolor/comments/104hq4j/new_to_watercolor_how_to_block_paper_to_avoid/j35c39r/) (in reply to ID j35btdi):\nIt’s definitely not watercolor paper.

Paper quality is critical to wc painting. Paint just behaves very differently.\n\nTape it down to a board before painting. That will prevent most buckling, unless you are doing very wet washes.\n\nYou can learn about soaking and stretching your paper before hand, and either stapling it or taping it, but it’s not really necessary, at least at this stage.\n\nRegular painter’s tape will do (although coloured tapes interfere somewhat with your pigment choices.) There is something called Artist’s Tape, but it is more expensive.\n\nBefore you use the tape though, stick it to your jeans etc 1-2x to remove excess glue. Then tape down your paper.\n\nWhen done and you remove the tape, keep it at a 45° angle and pull slowly. If there’s any sign of tearing, just use a blowdryer to heat up the tape as you remove it.\n\nHave fun!\n\n#### Comment ID j380390 with +3 score by [(BabyImafool, Reddit, 2023-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watercolor/comments/104hq4j/new_to_watercolor_how_to_block_paper_to_avoid/j380390/) (in reply to ID j35c39r):\nYou can also watercolor on some art canvas.

It’s like a watercolor sketch pad but instead of just the top/side being sealed to the spine, all of it is sealed down to prevent buckling. When it’s dry you just take it off of the pad and it’s much less bumpy than normal paper. The Arches watercolor blocks are 10/10. Lower quality watercolor paper or non watercolor paper will pretty much always do that though, regardless of whether you tape it down or not. I just also want to say though that this piece is wonderful in the way you did it! Great job.\n\n## Comment ID j35hkx9 with +6 score by [(Hawkthree, Reddit, 2023-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watercolor/comments/104hq4j/new_to_watercolor_how_to_block_paper_to_avoid/j35hkx9/) (in reply to ID 104hq4j):\nEven some great quality watercolor papers will buckle if doing a lot of wet work.  Arches will certainly do so.  Increasing the gsm will help.  That is a 90-lb paper will always buckle more than a 140 lb and a 300 lb paper will rarely buckle.\n\nThe art books for watercolor frequently are about a 90 pound.\n\nStonehenge Legion will very rarely buckle even at 140 lb.  Frequently cheaper than Arches because only 1 side is usable.\n\nTwinrocker 140 lb will not buckle but Twin Rocker is $17 for a 22\"x30\" sheet.  I'm still in learning mode, so this brand is out of my affordability.\n\nGenuinely stretching paper is a bit challenging but if you've got a technique down for that, even 90 lb paper won't buckle.  Basically you soak the paper until soft, then clamp firmly into place so it shrinks as it dries.  The clamping (or your preferred method) forces it to dry taut as a drum head.\n\n### Comment ID j37sg17 with +2 score by [(Old-Basil-5567, Reddit, 2023-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watercolor/comments/104hq4j/new_to_watercolor_how_to_block_paper_to_avoid/j37sg17/) (in reply to ID j35hkx9):\nIve done this like one does a canvas over a frame.

Most help needs to be through their chatbot and the chatbot WILL give you false information and once you speak to a real person you’ll finally find out what you want is impossible with Rippling but “that’s a new feature that will be available soon” \n\nI think the Time & Attendance app is nice and easy so it makes clocking in and out manageable for employees. You get lots of options on customization and workflow automations. Garnishments, reimbursements, deductions are easy to input especially if your health insurance is one that integrates with Rippling. \n\nDepending on your needs it could be a good system but we are moving back to our previous payroll system after 5 months with Rippling and couldn’t be happier leaving. We are a subcontractor who does PLA/PW/DB work so it’s not a good fit for us but could be for you.\n\n### Comment ID lnzk1qh with +1 score by [(OddEmergency8587, Reddit, 2024-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Payroll/comments/1fg8ct5/rippling_payroll_system/lnzk1qh/) (in reply to ID lnul80g):\nWe are in the support sector in heath care. So lots of people going to different locations, some have multiple positions and wages that happen in the same pay period. Having complex union rules added into the mix. And not all employees are unionized. \n\nThe scheduling piece is what would have worked so well for us. I just read too many mentions of compliance issues. We are a non profit so those kind of mistakes could be detrimental to us.

No windows open and no breeze anywhere. Printed at default PrusaSlicer settings for .2mm quality 0.4mm Hotend with brand new prusa black pla. Also bed was cleaned with IPA before printing. Any ideas how to stop this since I have no control over first layer??\n\n## Comment ID jt0bswg with +18 score by [(adam3dp, Reddit, 2023-07-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/prusa3d/comments/156gzc6/mk4_first_layer_rippling/jt0bswg/) (in reply to ID 156gzc6):\nI had this exact same issue on my MK4 kit.  It happened with Prusament using the Prusament preset in Prusa Slicer, and again with Hatchbox PLA using the Hatchbox PLA preset.  The only thing that seemed to help a little was using live adjust Z while printing, but the MK4 does not save that setting between prints.  After speaking with Prusa support multiple times and verifying lots of sensor values, it looks like the loadcel sensor is not returning expected values, which would certainly impact bed leveling and result in this type of issue.  I am currently waiting for Prusa support to investigate and get back to me with a solution.\n\n### Comment ID jt0c03b with +5 score by [(EquivalentTip4103, Reddit, 2023-07-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/prusa3d/comments/156gzc6/mk4_first_layer_rippling/jt0c03b/) (in reply to ID jt0bswg):\nThanks Adam.

A full bed first layer with Prusament PLA is about 99% perfect now, and Hatchbox PLA gets an acceptable first layer by dropping the nozzle temperature to 200C.

I would recommend evaluating [Scalefusion MDM](https://scalefusion.com/mobile-device-management?utm_campaign=Scalefusion%20Promotion&utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_term=AL), it has a very intuitive dashboard with relatively good customer support at a very affordable price.\n\n## Comment ID i300atq with +1 score by [(TemporaryObjective27, Reddit, 2022-04-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/i5k8sc/anyone_have_experience_with_rippling/i300atq/) (in reply to ID i5k8sc):\nI work for an MSP and rollout MDM all the time.We decided to try Rippling MDM as a cost savings strategy for a client that wanted to use it for HR.I do not recommend!The enrollment experience is tough. It takes like 25 minutes to manually enroll a device in Rippling and if a user doesn't wait or clicks the wrong things then the configuration gets messed up and there are errors.The more concerning drawback, is that we have all of these reports of the log in screen getting stuck and also the computer getting stuck in sleep mode where the only way to release is through clicking the power button.I've followed up with Rippling support on these issues and there has been no legitimate support. No one who works in support really understands the backend of the tool.",

Is there a specific reason you're sacrificing print quality by adding layer lines across the design and make wobbling an issue? \n\nLike I can't see one good reason to print them like this unless it doesn't fit the bed.\n\n### Comment ID ktrabqe with +1 score by [(PROCANNONDUDE, Reddit, 2024-03-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ender3/comments/1b8bs7u/why_are_these_tpu_prints_rippling_or_wavy/ktrabqe/) (in reply to ID ktr0heu):\nIm trying to get the design with most quality actually and printing flat makes the design literally NOT look good. because of how large horizontal lines are for design. (see photo) Sure I might end up finding it difficult to print vertically. But by looking at other comments I’ve actually fixed this ghosting issue. However You look like you might know more about printing horizontally rather, so is there a special cura setting that allows to print smaller lines for a more intricate design printing horizontally, or something I am missing?  Let me know because I’m curious.\n\nimg\n\n#### Comment ID ktrfvcc with +2 score by [(TwistedxBoi, Reddit, 2024-03-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ender3/comments/1b8bs7u/why_are_these_tpu_prints_rippling_or_wavy/ktrfvcc/) (in reply to ID ktrabqe):\nI'm not sure about Cura(haven't used it in a long time),but Orcaslicer allows you to turn on Arachne wall generator. That basically gives you variable line width to get smaller details that would be impossible with a static line width. You can get great detail even with a 0.4 nozzle. But you will of course get further with a 0.2. You said you have one so you could get great detail with.\n\nAlso, ironing the top layers should absolutely help fill in the tiny gaps that can still happen\n\n## Comment ID ktovocl with +1 score by [(Dekatater, Reddit, 2024-03-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ender3/comments/1b8bs7u/why_are_these_tpu_prints_rippling_or_wavy/ktovocl/) (in reply to ID 1b8bs7u):\n>(no I will not print horizontally)\n\n\nThen no, you will not solve this issue. TPU is a soft filament and by nature is very flexible. If you print this extremely thin model like this, the thing is going to wobble when it's printing, which is going to cause ringing and z banding.\n\n### Comment ID ktrctcu with +1 score by [(PROCANNONDUDE, Reddit, 2024-03-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ender3/comments/1b8bs7u/why_are_these_tpu_prints_rippling_or_wavy/ktrctcu/) (in reply to ID ktovocl):\nId 100% be willing to print horizontally, however this design is small enough to where I need to print it with smaller lines. I have a photo-v. So vertical layers end up being more helpful in making the design look better and more intricate. I was wondering though, If I could get similar results printing horizontally. If there is a cura setting or something that makes horizontal lines less pressed to already placed lines, to create smaller diameter lines for a more intricate looking print. Do you happen to know?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sniyq282twmc1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a13a6131d76d6b503036e2cd1b0bd1ea5bea8b7\n\n#### Comment ID ktrga4u with +2 score by [(Dekatater, Reddit, 2024-03-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ender3/comments/1b8bs7u/why_are_these_tpu_prints_rippling_or_wavy/ktrga4u/) (in reply to ID ktrctcu):\nWell, I know using Arachne as your perimeter generator helps, which is usually the default. You could also turn on ironing, which drastically smooths the top layers. I see why you want to print it vertically, it will not look the same otherwise. I would try adding something in the slicer like a box to the backside of the print and see if that helps keep it from wiggling, then remove when done. Kind of like making your own supports"

The other issue we had was that taxes were not paid on time A LOT *or* to the wrong agency *or* (this one is impressive) to the wrong account. How is this company even legal?? On top of that nothing is intuitive on their platform- I don’t think the developers have ever actually ran payroll based on how this app is laid our.

At this point, the company is really no longer a start-up, yet still has this start up mentality internally. You're constantly fixing mistakes from inept managers/sales teams who can't think on a broader level. \n- Micromanagement: You will be micro managed. For as much autonomy as you are theoretically given, Rippling doesn't have the engineering/product resources to actually execute solutions, so you'll end up with a project proposal that either gets ignored or pushed to Q4. So when all is said and done, you'll be blamed for not being able to fix an issue, even though you tried. \n- No career growth: Sure, if you work in sales maybe you'll get promoted to senior, or manager, but outside that? Good luck. \n- No yearly salary increases: Said what I said. Don't expect to make more money once you start so negotiate that salary hard. \n- Horrific wlb: You're always on. Holidays, days off, sick days. You are always on.",

The frequent turnover and assignment of implementation managers who may require further development in technical, project management, and soft skills pose challenges in maintaining a cohesive team environment. We did have an off-site though, and it was good to connect in person.\n\nThe recent departure of our VP of Implementation, similar to the previous VP's exit, has led to more concerns about the health of the organization.

You are interacting with really smart people and teams on a day to day basis, and hence learning and growing.\n\nOpen and improved engineering culture: There aren't any boundaries on people to go and learn, major engineering projects are put in open for others to discuss and learn. The engineering team and culture has improved vastly in the last 2 years, with a lot of seasoned staff and senior staff engineers in the org.\n\nProduct and revenue growth: Rippling's clarity in what they want to build had been astonishing from day 1. Some of the products that we recently launched are things that comp any had in their plan from day 1. There is so much conviction and clarity into all the product and engineering investment that most of our products launched scale from 0 to few millions of revenue within their first year. The revenue growth has been astonishing, not derailed by many macro economic crisis. The revenue stream is diversified and proven to be resilient to so many external factors.",

Consequently, they face different challenges than Rippling. For companies that are just starting, the problems they encounter are often too early to be fully addressed. For large, established companies, the issues they face have typically been resolved and any improvements are merely incremental. Rippling, however, finds itself in a middle ground where it continuously encounters new and evolving challenges. As a result, there is no end to impact if someone is up for it.",

Instead, it has been incredibly refreshing as a member of the legal and compliance team to get a running head start on nearly all projects, so that we can pull together the right compliance infrastructure for our products, and be deeply embedded in our product initiatives, often dogfooding and testing what we've advised on and built. Our team has also gotten to be true advocates, fiercely defend our employees from aggressive competitor tactics, pulling together a first rate immigration program for our team, commanding one of the most efficient sales/commercial processes. In short, it is really fun (and rare) to help win as a business, while also doing it the right way and with flair. And we have fun :) \n\nRippling is also one of the most transparent places that I have worked in that, top down and bottoms up, people actually say what they are thinking and have discussions. While candor can take some getting used to (and for some, may seem like a con), it has meant that this has been the least political and bureaucratic place that I have ever worked. There's simply has been no room for politics (giving off appearance instead of reality) because people say whats on their mind, ask a lot of questions, and \"go and see\" what the truth/reality is.",

I finally found a home. \n\nStarting in sales, I was impressed by the supportive team dynamic and Rippling's commitment to my success. I was fortunate to be promoted to a leadership role, which speaks volumes about Rippling's investment in its employees' growth and career trajectory opportunities. \n\nThe culture here is bar none. It's fast-paced and innovative, but also incredibly collaborative and supportive. Everyone is passionate about what they do, and that energy is contagious. You get to talk about the best platform in the game on a daily basis as Rippling is a true \"game changer\" in the industry, \n\nIf you're looking for a place to challenge yourself, learn from talented colleagues, and be part of something truly special, Rippling is definitely worth considering. \n\nThe executive team is first class all around and they truly care about everyone here, all while building something special. From Parker Conrad, to Matt Plank to Matt MacInnis to Paul Barber. They are some of the most genuine leaders I have seen and worked with.",

The best way I can describe the culture is unkind and untrusting.\n-benefits are trash, and more importantly, leadership is pretty clear that they don’t care or intend to improve this. The overall vibe at Rippling is “you are lucky to work here, so you take what you’re given.” This has worked for them so far in the startup phase, but I see this crumbling in the near future. You can’t have the turnover this company has and execute a successful longterm strategy.\n-generally, middle managers are inexperienced and aren’t on your side\n-work-life balance is non-existent and in fact, the CEO has said in so many words that he doesn’t believe in it\n-there doesn’t seem to be an overall vision or strategy: for the product, for company initiatives, for any part of Rippling. Again, this is possible when you are a series A/B/C, but I’m not sure how this works out in the long run.",

The reviews that state work life balance is awful are 100% true, and unfortunately, you will likely burn out before the company reaches their IPO anyway. This isn’t necessarily Ripplings fault entirely, it’s just that payroll, benefits, Hr is a grueling awful vertical to play in. You’ll quickly get tired of clients complaining about almost every aspect of the product. Trust me, it brings your life down so much that you’ll start questioning your career path. The executive team in this company needs to realize that sometimes building new SKU’s for the sake of new SKU’s is not going to sit well with your current client base. Current client enhancements can go often ignored… I expect a relatively high client churn rate for the next few years, before management gets the clue and maybe 180’s their strategy. They’ll need to do this before it’s too late and total ARR starts moving in the wrong direction. Product is struggling to scale to enterprise level/quality, but that’s a challenge at all SaaS companies. If you’re okay grinding and saying goodbye to your friends and family, then this may be an okay place for you. Otherwise, find a better SaaS vertical to play in.",

I never have and dont think i ever will work somewhere as stressful as Rippling. It seemed random when certain employees were let go and it was never consistent in terms of performance and how long someone may be underperforming for. On top of that, my leaders would see how stressed I was, and never asked how I was doing, the only thing was whats the next task or deal, never time to breathe. Offer clear expectations and promotion paths, stop changing pay and making it confusing to the point where reps have 5+ calls to understand it, and take better care of your employees cause they aren’t a number and I can guarantee a huge number of them are burnt out.",

For some promotions seem easy and happen quick, and for others, its seems impossible. I was over 110% quota for a 12-14 month period and those performing below me and those with less tenure got interviews and roles in segments higher than me. On top of that, they kept giving me more responsibilities on top of the hundreds of accounts I managed (300-600 accounts). Those responsibilities included training 3 new hires at the same time, helping those I was not assigned too because some managers wouldn’t help them, and even training people at the management level. Not once did I get a pay raise (only decreases), or even an interview for an up segment role even though I voiced my want for that and a pay raise my last 6+months there. Managing that many accounts also leaved almost no time to get work done but management is constantly hounding you to have everything up to date. When you have 7 sales calls a day and about 50 emails coming in every day its almost impossible. I was working from 8-8 almost every day, and only to be thanked by pay decrease, confusing quota changes that decreased pay, and not a single look or real conversation about my future.",

          "cons": "Fast-Paced Environment: Rippling is a rapidly growing company, and the fast-paced nature of the work can be overwhelming for some employees. The demand for quick results and constant change may lead to a high-pressure environment.\n\nWork-Life Balance Challenges: Due to the dynamic and ambitious culture, some employees may find it difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Long hours and the expectation to remain responsive can occasionally interfere with personal time.\n\nRole Ambiguity: As with many fast-growing companies, there may be some uncertainty about job roles and responsibilities, particularly in the early stages of employment or in newly created positions. Employees may need to adapt quickly to shifting expectations.\n\nHeavy Workload: Some employees report that the workload can be intense, particularly during peak periods. This can lead to burnout if not managed effectively.\n\nLimited Remote Opportunities for Some Roles: While Rippling does offer remote work options for many positions, some roles might require employees to work from the office, limiting flexibility for those seeking full-time remote opportunities.\n\nGrowing Pains: As a company experiencing rapid growth, Rippling may face some challenges related to scalability, including potential inefficiencies in processes, evolving company policies, and a lack of formalized structures in some areas.\n\nHigh Expectations: Rippling hires driven, ambitious individuals, and the high expectations placed on employees may not suit everyone. People looking for a more laid-back or less demanding work environment may find this culture difficult to adapt to.\n\nLimited Focus on Employee Perks: While Rippling offers solid compensation and benefits, some employees may feel that certain perks or initiatives, like wellness programs or additional employee benefits, are not as robust compared to other tech companies.\n\nThese cons are worth considering when evaluating Rippling as an employer, especially if work-life balance or clear structure are important to you. However, many employees thrive in the company's fast-paced and dynamic environment, so the experience can vary depending on role and individual preferences.",

A lot of people who work here are kind and cool people but everyone is running around with their heads chopped off. -If you want to be so stressed out of your mind that you stop eating, lose your quality of life, then work here.

This isn’t necessarily Ripplings fault entirely, it’s just that payroll, benefits, Hr is a grueling awful vertical to play in. You’ll quickly get tired of clients complaining about almost every aspect of the product. Trust me, it brings your life down so much that you’ll start questioning your career path. The executive team in this company needs to realize that sometimes building new SKU’s for the sake of new SKU’s is not going to sit well with your current client base. Current client enhancements can go often ignored… I expect a relatively high client churn rate for the next few years, before management gets the clue and maybe 180’s their strategy. They’ll need to do this before it’s too late and total ARR starts moving in the wrong direction. Product is struggling to scale to enterprise level/quality, but that’s a challenge at all SaaS companies. If you’re okay grinding and saying goodbye to your friends and family, then this may be an okay place for you. Otherwise, find a better SaaS vertical to play in.",

Those responsibilities included training 3 new hires at the same time, helping those I was not assigned too because some managers wouldn’t help them, and even training people at the management level. Not once did I get a pay raise (only decreases), or even an interview for an up segment role even though I voiced my want for that and a pay raise my last 6+months there. Managing that many accounts also leaved almost no time to get work done but management is constantly hounding you to have everything up to date. When you have 7 sales calls a day and about 50 emails coming in every day its almost impossible.

Long hours and the expectation to remain responsive can occasionally interfere with personal time.\n\nRole Ambiguity: As with many fast-growing companies, there may be some uncertainty about job roles and responsibilities, particularly in the early stages of employment or in newly created positions. Employees may need to adapt quickly to shifting expectations.\n\nHeavy Workload: Some employees report that the workload can be intense, particularly during peak periods. This can lead to burnout if not managed effectively.\n\nLimited Remote Opportunities for Some Roles: While Rippling does offer remote work options for many positions, some roles might require employees to work from the office, limiting flexibility for those seeking full-time remote opportunities.\n\nGrowing Pains: As a company experiencing rapid growth, Rippling may face some challenges related to scalability, including potential inefficiencies in processes, evolving company policies, and a lack of formalized structures in some areas.\n\nHigh Expectations: Rippling hires driven, ambitious individuals, and the high expectations placed on employees may not suit everyone. People looking for a more laid-back or less demanding work environment may find this culture difficult to adapt to.\n\nLimited Focus on Employee Perks: While Rippling offers solid compensation and benefits, some employees may feel that certain perks or initiatives, like wellness programs or additional employee benefits, are not as robust compared to other tech companies.\n\nThese cons are worth considering when evaluating Rippling as an employer, especially if work-life balance or clear structure are important to you.

For as much autonomy as you are theoretically given, Rippling doesn't have the engineering/product resources to actually execute solutions, so you'll end up with a project proposal that either gets ignored or pushed to Q4. So when all is said and done, you'll be blamed for not being able to fix an issue, even though you tried. \n- No career growth: Sure, if you work in sales maybe you'll get promoted to senior, or manager, but outside that? Good luck. \n- No yearly salary increases: Said what I said. Don't expect to make more money once you start so negotiate that salary hard. \n- Horrific wlb: You're always on.

      "# [Rippling Announces Series F Fundraising & Tender Offer by Parker Conrad on 2024-04-22](https://www.rippling.com/blog/rippling-announces-series-f-fundraising-and-tender-offer)\nWe’re pleased to announce Rippling has raised $200M in new financing, and signed agreements with investors to repurchase up to $590M of equity from current employees, former employees, and early investors. The financing was led by Coatue with participation from Founders Fund, Greenoaks, and other existing investors. Dragoneer is joining the round as a new investor.\n\nThe financing values the company at $13.5 billion.\n\nWe’re grateful for these investors’ conviction in Rippling, for the employees that have gotten us to this point, and for our clients, without whom none of this would be possible.\n\nRippling’s core thesis is that employee data is critical to a surprisingly large number of business systems, including the ones well outside of HR.\n\nMaintaining the fidelity of the same employee data across all these disconnected systems—effectively, across multiple separate databases—is the reason it’s a lot of work for companies to have many different business systems in the first place. Rippling solves this problem by giving companies and employees a single place to make changes, which then propagate everywhere automatically.\n\nThe system that does this isn’t just a time-saver—we believe it will be a critical primitive for business software going forward.\n\nProducts that are built on top of a rich graph of data about the organization, employees, their devices and apps aren’t just easier to manage. They are better as software products—with more intelligent workflows and approvals, better role-based policies and permissions, and more powerful analytics.\n\nThis system we’ve built helps companies run more efficiently and achieve their business goals faster than their competitors. We will continue to expand in new markets and invest deeply in R&D to enhance our current offering and build new products to support our clients.\n\nTo better understand Rippling’s approach and where we’re headed, you can read a lightly redacted version of the memo I wrote for investors ahead of this financing.",

It is integrated with more than 500 apps and helps businesses execute more efficiently.\n\n“Rippling’s core thesis is that employee data is critical to a surprisingly large number of business systems, including the ones well outside of HR,” Conrad wrote in the post.\n\nBy providing a single place where companies and employees can make changes, which then propagate everywhere automatically, Rippling solves the challenge of maintaining the accuracy of employee data across disconnected systems, according to the post.\n\nThis not only saves time but also enables more intelligent workflows and approvals, better role-based policies and permissions, and more powerful analytics, the post said.\n\n“The system we’ve built helps companies run more efficiently and achieve their business goals faster than their competitors,” Conrad wrote in the post. “We will continue to expand in new markets and invest deeply in R&D to enhance our current offering and build new products to support our clients.”\n\nIt was reported April 16 that Rippling was in discussions about a funding round that would value it at $13.4 billion. The company had already raised a total of $1.2 billion, TechCrunch reported at the time.\n\nRippling’s Series F round comes about a year after it raised $500 million in Series E financing and was valued at $11.25 billion. That valuation was about the same as its Series D financing in May 2022, the company said in a March 17 blog post.",

      "# [Rippling Launches Performance Management by People Center Inc. dba Rippling on 2024-05-08](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/05/08/2877869/0/en/Rippling-Launches-Performance-Management.html)\nSAN FRANCISCO, May 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rippling, the leading unified workforce management platform, today launched Performance Management. With Performance Management, Rippling customers can run global performance review cycles with 360º feedback, calibrate ratings confidentially, and run compensation processes including bonus payments. They can set up merit matrices and push changes directly to payroll. Rippling also supports year-round performance with triggered milestone reviews, goal setting, and soon, 1:1s.\n\nUnlike point solutions or legacy all-in-one systems, Performance Management is customizable to the business’s needs. And since all Rippling apps are natively built on top of the unified platform, clients can seamlessly connect performance data with other Rippling applications like Recruiting and Payroll as well as past cycle feedback and historical changes. As a result, reviews are always based on up-to-date employee attributes and can even be triggered at specific moments in the individual employee's lifecycle– all while ensuring complete control over who has access to performance data.\n\n“For HR leaders, unlocking employee talent is a top priority. But too often, they’re forced to design the performance management process around rigid, disconnected systems, rather than around the culture and the business’s needs,” said Darcy Mackay, Rippling’s SVP of HR and Client Services. “We want companies to stop managing spreadsheets and spend more time developing their people. Our Performance Management solution does just that.”\n\n“By removing the worry and arduousness of traditional review cycles, Rippling has helped us turn our performance management process into a strategic asset. We’re able to easily run an equitable, thorough, ongoing performance process for our team members and we’re already seeing the impact on our business,” said Laura Downey, LightForce’s HR Manager.\n\nRippling’s new Performance Management solution addresses the most common performance management pain points:\n\nAligning Employee Performance with Business Goals\n\nShared organizational goals are usually stored in a different system or locked in static documents, making it time-consuming to set and track an individual’s objectives and their progress against them. With Rippling, managers can quickly create goals, cascade them through their reporting line, and allocate ownership to specific members of their team. Likewise, instead of logging into a separate system, employees can review their goals regularly, using a system they’re in every day. And, because the Performance Management product connects to Rippling’s Employee Graph, business leaders can report on goal outcomes and trends alongside any other data in Rippling—including department, tenure, level and engagement surveys.\n\nLaunching Review Cycles\n\nTraditionally, launching a review cycle takes hours of manual work, especially if any customization is required. Because Rippling already understands a company’s roles and reporting structures, set-up is simplified and customization is painless. For example, you can create a full 360º review with upward, downward, and peer reviews. Within that cycle, you can decide how many peer reviews you want for each employee, specify unique questions for each department or reviewer, and even set rules about who should do the review if an employee transitioned managers during the review period.\n\nManaging Calibrations\n\nEnsuring reviews are consistent and fair usually requires hours of meetings and a plethora of spreadsheets– both in an effort to make sure no manager can view sensitive reviews and ratings information outside their scope. Because Rippling is built around one central source of truth for your organization, the system already knows which managers and HR business partners should have access to which employees’ information. It automatically handles all permissions, allowing appropriate managers and HR to compare and calibrate ratings directly in the app in either tabular or graphical format without having to use a single spreadsheet, eliminating the risk of confidential information falling into the wrong hands.\n\nStreamlining Compensation & Rewards\n\nAfter a typical review cycle, companies struggle not only with defining rewards schedules but also with sticking to their overall budget. Once compensation decisions are made, propagating those changes to a payroll system in an error-free manner is, at best, difficult and at worst, not even possible. This process often takes significant time after a review cycle, requiring endless spreadsheets and analysts to complete, resulting in review processes that can take many months to complete.\n\nRippling streamlines this entire process with built-in, customizable merit matrices, a real-time multi-currency view of a company’s overall rewards budget and dynamic policies that ensure an equitable process to help retain talent. This means any merit or level changes reflect automatically across the system, including payroll.\n\nConnecting Everything Together\n\nThe problem of disconnected systems is widespread. More than half of HR teams use seven or more point solutions. Legacy all-in-one systems, on the other hand, may share a common interface, but they lack configurability, preventing HR teams from tailoring review cycles to meet their particular organization’s needs. Often, privacy and data protection concerns are to blame for the fragmentation. But with Rippling’s Employee Graph at the core of every one of its products, including Performance Management, permissioning is already built in.\n\nAbout Rippling\n\nRippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance—globally. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, identity & access management, and device management. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.\n\nBased in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1.4B from the world's top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, and Bedrock.\n\nFor more information, visit Rippling.com.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nKristina Leal\n\nFirebrand Communications for Rippling\n\n415.848.9175\n\nrippling@firebrand.marketing",

      "# [Rippling Rolls Out AI-Powered Employee Evaluation Tool by PYMNTS, www.facebook.com on 2024-09-25](https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2024/rippling-rolls-out-ai-powered-employee-evaluation-tool/)\nWould you trust artificial intelligence-powered tools to conduct your employee evaluation?\n\nBusiness software startup Rippling hopes the answer is yes.\n\nThe company is launching a product called Talent Signal, which uses AI to gauge employee performance based on task-specific metrics, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (Sept. 25).\n\nThe tool can spot patterns a manager might not notice, helping companies better use resources while determining which employees may need fast-tracking or additional guidance, the report said.\n\n“In the ideal case, the manager would pull up a chair next to the employee and spend 90 days with them,” coaching them, said Rippling Chief Operating Officer Matt MacInnis, per the report.\n\nWhile few managers have time for that sort of effort, AI does, the report added. Those who have tested Talent Signal said the tool lets them set aside preconceived notions and look objectively as they evaluate an employee’s performance.\n\nMacInnis acknowledged some people might find the product unsettling, but it’s no less strange than a manager tracking a new employee, and it offers less bias, the report said.\n\nThe standard 90-day evaluation “can’t be about the vibe,” MacInnis said, per the report. “It’s got to be about the facts.”\n\nRippling’s workforce management platform combines human resources, informational technology and finance functions to create what it calls a “single source of truth” for employee data. The company raised $200 million in a Series F round in April that valued Rippling at $13.5 billion.\n\n“Rippling’s core thesis is that employee data is critical to a surprisingly large number of business systems, including the ones well outside of HR,” CEO Parker Conrad said at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, experts interviewed by PYMNTS have stressed the need for a balanced approach to AI that includes human intervention. Gillian Laging, co-founder of Scopey, a scope management platform, argued for built-in human oversight, pointing to her firm’s practice of having users review AI-drafted scopes of work before passing them on to clients.\n\n“This approach acknowledges that while AI can dramatically speed up certain processes, human judgment remains invaluable,” PYMNTS reported this month. “For instance, an AI might draft a comprehensive project scope, but a seasoned professional can spot nuances, potential issues or client-specific considerations that the AI might miss.”",
