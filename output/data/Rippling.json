It’s a powerful set of core capabilities, including workflow automation, analytics, permissions, and policies. These components sit inside every product we build, and their functionality can be reconfigured to address a wide array of problems. With this foundation in place, we skip building the most primitive parts of each product over and over.\n\nSince we’re not building from scratch, our engineers can focus on the most interesting—and challenging—parts of their particular product. They spend their time understanding the business processes, decision-making, and workflows specific to what they’re building and determining which abstractions are right for supporting its most complex use cases.

      "# [Highnoon uses Rippling to onboard employees 10x faster](https://www.rippling.com/customers/highnoon)\nHighnoon is a full-service marketing, advertising, consulting, and technology agency that helps medium to large organizations “turn their bold visions into reality.” As the agency’s Managing Partner, Scott Kaufmann sets the vision for the company and oversees daily operations.\n\n“Rippling helps minimize the administrative work on the HR and IT side, which means I can spend more time on what I enjoy most: helping clients solve problems with innovative strategies,” he explains.\n\nAutomating HR operations and technology management\n\nAt his previous agency, Scott used a combination of Zenefits for people operations and Quickbooks Payroll for payroll. Prior to starting Highnoon, he knew he wanted to stick with a platform that could automate the HR portion. Scott evaluated a few competitors, like BambooHR, but it became clear that they were missing crucial portions of what Highnoon needed, like the ability to integrate with their 401(k) and time tracking software. Scott ended up choosing Rippling for Highnoon because he was excited by the platform’s ability not only to automate HR operations, but also to handle the IT side with app and device management. “At my previous agency, we had an issue where our people operations were automated, but our technology systems weren’t,” he said. “Rippling would finally be able to solve that for us.” Implementing Rippling was seamless and took about two months. Highnoon decided to take their time with the implementation; they knew they needed payroll and benefits on day one, but everything else could come later. “We actually ended up getting much more than that on the first day of work. We were able to connect several different systems into Rippling, including our office suite and project minutes, which was great,” Scott told us.\n\nAn all-in-one system that feels like\n\nan enterprise product\n\n“With Rippling’s added layer of technology management, the platform is able to harmonize both the HR and the IT side. Rippling has also continued to mature and add new features over time; it’s an all-in-one system that feels like an enterprise product,” said Scott. “Our employees are already used to seamless and intuitive experiences in their consumer technology—so we’re happy we can match that standard with Rippling’s modern payroll and benefits platform.”\n\nScott Kaufmann\n\nOther highlights include:\n\n50% time savings with identity and device management:\n\n“By automating the technology management side, Rippling has saved us 50% more time compared to what we used at my previous agency. I love that we can provision devices with cascading permissions based on role, in addition to things like device ID tracking and managing SSO for all our different apps.\n\n10x faster employee onboarding:\n\n“At our previous company, provisioning employee devices with access was a heavy administrative burden and could take five hours. With Rippling, it takes 30 minutes at most.”\n\nIntuitive, easy-to-use payroll:\n\n“Rippling is more intuitive and easier to use than other payroll providers I’ve used, like ADP. I also appreciate their thoughtful touches that improve the employee experience, including providing digital copies of W-2s inside the Rippling portal, making them much easier to keep track of and easier for employees to access.”\n\nImproved benefits management process:\n\n“Rippling gives our employees a clear understanding of how much different insurance plans will cost, making it easy for them to be informed about which benefits to choose.”\n\n400+ integrations to help automate admin work:\n\n“It’s great that Rippling integrates with so many of our existing systems, including Cylance, a security suite that helps prevent malware and viruses.”\n\nDifferent levels of access so everyone can take care of what they need to:\n\n“Rippling provides us with just the right amount of granularity in terms of access for all of our different users. For example, we have a people ops manager and health insurance broker as admins with different levels of permissions, in addition to department leads who can manage the people processes and approvals for their teams autonomously.”",
      "# [What Is a P11D?](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/p11d)\nWhat is a P11D form used for?\n\nA P11D form is used by UK employers to report taxable benefits in kind (BIK) they provide to employees on top of their regular wages or salaries.\n\nThese are benefits or perks that employees receive in addition to their regular pay, such as company cars, private medical insurance, or interest-free loans. The P11D form is submitted to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) so they can calculate the tax the employee owes on the benefits.\n\nIn some cases, employee benefits can be payrolled through the “payrolling benefits in kind” system, but if not, they are reported on a P11D. The form may also affect an employee's self-assessment tax return or the tax code they’re assigned for the following tax year.\n\nWho gets a P11D?\n\nAny employee or director who receives taxable benefits from their employer should receive a P11D. This applies to individuals who have received perks or benefits that are not directly included in their wages or salaries. The form helps calculate the income tax they owe on these benefits.\n\nWho files a P11D?\n\nIt is the employer’s responsibility to file the P11D form with HMRC. They must also provide a copy to the employee so they can check the information and use it when filing their personal tax returns.\n\nWhen are P11D forms due?\n\nEmployers are required to file the P11D forms by the 6th of July following the end of the tax year, which runs from April 6 to April 5. This gives both HMRC and employees enough time to prepare returns and make needed adjustments.\n\nWhat information is included on a P11D?\n\nA P11D form includes details that allow HMRC to determine how much tax is due on benefits an employee received throughout the tax year, including the value of the benefits, the cash equivalent (if applicable), and how these figures were calculated.\n\nThe form also includes spaces for reporting specific types of taxable benefits, described below.\n\nTypes of benefits reportable on a P11D\n\nThe following are common benefits that are reportable on a P11D:\n\nCredit cards provided by the company\n\nVouchers or gifts\n\nSubscriptions to clubs or professional bodies\n\nInterest-free loans from the employer\n\nMileage allowance for personal vehicle use\n\nChildcare benefits not exempt from tax\n\nGym memberships paid by the employer\n\nPrivate medical insurance\n\nRail season tickets (including season ticket loans) provided as a benefit\n\nP11D exemptions\n\nCertain benefits and expenses—including business travel, entertainment, fees, and subscription—are exempt from being reported on a P11D form. These are not taxable and don't need to be included on the form as long as they meet the required criteria set by HMRC.\n\nP11D and taxes\n\nThe P11D form plays a crucial role at tax time.\n\nDoes the P11D form affect National Insurance contributions?\n\nYes, the P11D form does affect National Insurance contributions (NICs), but not for the employees. Employees don’t pay NICs on benefits reported on a P11D. Instead, employers are required to pay NICs on most taxable benefits. The total value of the benefits is used to calculate the NICs owed by the employer.\n\nWho pays P11D tax?\n\nEmployees are required to pay tax on the benefits reported in their P11D form. This tax is generally collected through adjustments to their tax code or via a self-assessment tax return. Employers, on the other hand, are responsible for paying the Class 1A NICs on the value of the benefits.\n\nHow is P11D tax calculated?\n\nThe P11D tax is calculated based on the value of the benefits provided, also known as the cash equivalent. Each benefit is assigned a taxable value, which is added to the employee's overall income for the year. The employee then pays tax on this total income according to their tax bracket.\n\nHow to file a P11D form\n\nEmployers can file a P11D form online through PAYE Online Service or using payroll software that is compatible with the service. Manual filing on paper is no longer accepted.\n\nFrequently asked questions about P11D forms\n\nP11D vs. P11D(b)\n\nThe P11D form reports the taxable benefits provided to employees, while the P11D(b) is used by employers to declare how much they owe in Class 1A National Insurance contributions (Class 1A NICs) on those benefits. Employers are required to submit both forms to HMRC to ensure compliance with tax laws and NIC obligations.\n\nDo self-employed workers need to file a P11D?\n\nNo, self-employed workers, also known as freelancers or sole traders, do not need to file a P11D. These forms are for employees who receive benefits from their employer. Self-employed individuals report their income and business expenses through the self-assessment process instead.\n\nDo business expenses get reported on P11D forms?\n\nBusiness expenses that are incurred solely for work purposes and meet specific criteria set by HMRC do not need to be reported on a P11D form. However, if expenses are considered personal benefits or perks, such as personal travel or non-business-related entertainment, they must be reported.",

      "# [What Is a 401(k)?](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/401k)\n401(k) vs. other investment accounts\n\nIf you’re planning for retirement, you’re probably wondering how a 401(k) compares to other investment options. The 401(k) offers unique tax advantages, particularly in how contributions and earnings are treated, which might make it a more attractive option than other accounts depending on your financial goals.\n\n401(k) vs. pension\n\nPension: A retirement plan typically funded and managed by an employer, where the employee receives a fixed monthly benefit upon retirement. The amount is usually based on salary and years of service.\n\n401(k): A defined contribution plan, meaning the employee (and sometimes the employer) contributes money into the account, but the retirement benefits depend on the investment options chosen and the account's performance.\n\nPensions provide guaranteed income. On the other hand, 401(k)s offer more flexibility and potential growth, but also come with investment risks.\n\n401(k) vs. IRA\n\nBoth 401(k)s and IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts) are tax-advantaged retirement accounts, but they differ in contribution limits, tax treatment, and eligibility.\n\nA 401(k) is typically employer-sponsored, allows higher contribution limits, and often includes employer matching contributions.\n\nAn IRA, which can be a traditional or Roth IRA, is opened independently by the individual, offering more investment options but lower contribution limits. A Roth IRA, specifically, offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, unlike a traditional 401(k), where withdrawals are taxed. The choice between a 401(k) and an IRA often depends on whether the account holder needs higher contribution limits or wants employer contributions.\n\n401(k) vs. brokerage account\n\nA brokerage account is a taxable account where you can buy and sell a wide range of investments, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Unlike a 401(k), contributions to a brokerage account are not tax-advantaged, meaning you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains each year. However, brokerage accounts offer more flexibility in terms of investment options and access to funds, making them useful for short- to medium-term financial goals, while a 401(k) is typically more suited for long-term retirement savings due to its tax benefits and penalties for early withdrawal.\n\nWho is a 401(k) for?\n\nA 401(k) is designed for employees in America who want to save for retirement while taking advantage of tax benefits. It is particularly beneficial for those whose employers offer matching contributions, as this essentially provides free money toward retirement savings.\n\nThe 401(k) is suitable for individuals who are willing to invest their contributions in a range of funds, understanding that their retirement income will depend on how their investments perform.\n\nPros and cons of a 401(k)\n\nHow does a 401(k) work?\n\nNow that you know what a 401(k) is, how does it work?\n\nA 401(k) is a retirement savings plan that allows employees to contribute a portion of their salary into a tax-advantaged account, often with matching employer contributions. This type of plan is known as a defined contribution plan, meaning that the retirement benefits are based on the amount contributed and the performance of the investments chosen.\n\nAmericans use 401(k) plans as a primary method for building retirement savings, typically through employer-sponsored programs. Depending on the type of plan, employee contributions can be made on a pre-tax basis, meaning they reduce the employee’s taxable income for the year. The contributions then grow tax-deferred, with taxes paid only upon withdrawal in retirement.\n\nEmployer contributions to your 401(k) may be subject to a vesting schedule, meaning you need to remain employed with the company for a certain period before you fully own those contributions.\n\nWhat is a traditional 401(k)?\n\nA traditional 401(k) is a type of retirement savings account where contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your current taxable income. The funds grow tax-deferred, and you pay income tax on withdrawals during retirement.\n\nPlan contribution limits: For 2024, the annual contribution limit is $23,000 for individuals under 50. Those 50 and older can make an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500, for a total annual contribution of $30,500.\n\nEmployer matching: Cannot exceed the lesser of $69,000 for individuals under 50 (pr $76,500 for those 50 and up) or 100% of the employee’s annual compensation.\n\nRequired minimum distributions (RMDs): Once you reach age 73, you are required to start taking minimum distributions from your traditional 401(k) each year. The amount is calculated based on your life expectancy.\n\nPros and cons of a traditional 401(k)\n\nWhat is a Roth 401(k)?\n\nA Roth 401(k) is similar to a traditional 401(k) but with a key difference in tax treatment. Contributions to a Roth 401(k) are made with after-tax dollars, meaning they do not reduce your current taxable income. However, withdrawals during retirement are tax-free, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nPlan contribution limits: For 2024, the annual contribution limit is $23,000 for individuals under 50. Those 50 and older can make an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500, for a total annual contribution of $30,500.\n\nEmployer matching: Cannot exceed the lesser of $69,000 for individuals under 50 (pr $76,500 for those 50 and up) or 100% of the employee’s annual compensation.\n\nRequired minimum distributions (RMDs): None.\n\nPros and cons of a Roth 401(k)\n\nHow do you start a 401(k)?\n\nIndividuals generally can’t start a 401(k) on their own—you need to enroll in your employer’s retirement plan during the onboarding process or an open enrollment period. Eligibility requirements vary by employer, but most plans allow employees to begin contributing once they have met certain employment criteria, such as a specific length of service.\n\nTo enroll, you’ll need to fill out the necessary forms provided by your employer, choose your contribution rate, and select your investment options from those offered within the plan.\n\nHow does a 401(k) earn money?\n\nA 401(k) earns money through the growth of the investments chosen by the plan participants.\n\nThese can include:\n\nMutual funds\n\nTarget date funds\n\nStocks\n\nBonds\n\nOther securities\n\nThe account balance grows over time as the account investments generate returns, such as dividends or capital gains. The specific investment strategy you choose, based on your risk tolerance and retirement goals, will influence how much your 401(k) earns. Diversified investments can help manage risk and maximize growth potential over the long term.\n\nHow and when do you withdraw from a 401(k)?\n\nWithdrawals from a 401(k) are, as a rule, only allowed once the account owner reaches age 59½, though plan participants may take early withdrawals under certain conditions—often with penalties.\n\nQualified distributions from traditional 401(k) accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified distributions from Roth accounts are tax-free.\n\nAll IRS rules about 401(k) distributions (and their tax treatment) can be found in Publication 575, Pension and Annuity Income.\n\nFrequently asked questions about 401(k)s\n\nStill have questions about 401(k)s? Learn more in the FAQs below.\n\nCan you take early withdrawals from a 401(k)?\n\nYou can take early withdrawals from a 401(k), but it’s important to understand the potential penalties and tax implications. Generally, withdrawing funds before age 59½ will result in a 10% early withdrawal penalty in addition to the regular income tax on the withdrawn amount. However, there are exceptions for specific circumstances, such as a hardship withdrawal, which may allow you to avoid the penalty but still require you to pay income taxes on the amount. Consulting with a financial advisor before taking an early withdrawal can help you understand your options and minimize financial consequences.\n\nWhat happens to your 401(k) if you leave your job?\n\nIf you leave your job, you have several options for your 401(k). You can leave the funds in your former employer’s plan, if allowed, or you can roll over the balance into a new employer’s 401(k) plan or an IRA. Rolling over your 401(k) can help you consolidate your retirement savings and maintain control over your investments, but it’s important to handle the rollover process correctly to avoid taxes and penalties.\n\nAre 401(k)s taxed?\n\nIf you have a traditional 401(k), you make pre-tax contributions, allowing your investments to grow until you withdraw them in retirement (also known as tax deferral). Upon withdrawal, the funds are taxed as ordinary income.\n\nIf you have a Roth 401(k), contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so withdrawals during retirement are tax-free, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nWhat is a solo 401(k)?\n\nA Solo 401(k) is a retirement savings plan designed for self-employed individuals or small business owners with no full-time employees other than the business owner and their spouse. This plan allows for higher contribution limits than traditional 401(k) plans because the business owner can contribute both as an employer and an employee. A Solo 401(k) can be an excellent option for small business owners looking to maximize their retirement savings.",
      "# [Sierra uses Rippling to Deliver an Employee Experience as Delightful as Their Customer Experience](https://www.rippling.com/customers/sierra)\nAs a leading platform of conversational AI agents, Sierra helps businesses “elevate [their] customer experience.” And this dedication to providing swift, reliable, and empathetic help extends to the company’s own workforce.\n\n“I think of our employees as my customers,” said Natasha Clare, Sierra’s Head of Operations. “We want everyone that joins Sierra to feel like they had a high touch onboarding experience.” While this was easy enough when Natasha joined the recently formed company in May 2023, Sierra grew tenfold within a year and expects continued, fast-paced hiring in the months ahead.\n\nNatasha and Business Ops team member Nittai Malchin handle onboarding, compliance, benefits, payroll, and countless other People tasks for Sierra’s workforce. They want to maintain a high level of employee support as Sierra aims to hit its ambitious growth goals. There is no room for slow and clunky processes across a patchwork of different software systems.\n\nSierra joined Rippling PEO and united HR functions across payroll, onboarding, compliance, and benefits administration alongside device and expense management support.\n\nNow, Sierra’s administrators can hire, manage, and pay its growing workforce efficiently. And employees get a comprehensive HR experience that sets them up for success.\n\nWe couldn’t function without Rippling.\n\nBret Taylor\n\nCEO of Sierra, Chairman of OpenAI, Former CEO of Salesforce\n\n01\n\nA better employee experience\n\nRippling allows Natasha to deliver on her goal of providing a premium onboarding process for every new team member, even as Sierra quickly scales. “It’s a really streamlined, centralized experience for employees,” Natasha said. “Our employees appreciate having one centralized location for healthcare enrollment, payroll, and employee information. It really is a one-stop shop.”\n\nShe also said employees find Rippling’s Expense Management feature easy to use, since their direct deposit information is already in the system and linked to payroll, which allows the team to get quickly reimbursed for business purchases.\n\nAccording to Clay Bavor, Sierra’s co-founder, Rippling’s ease-of-use helps the company promote its culture. “One of our company values is craftsmanship,” he said. “While we think of that through the lens of what our product looks like, it applies to all of our operations, including the tools we use and vendors we partner with. We really care about what we put in front of our teams and we love the look and feel of Rippling.”\n\n02\n\nAll-in-one workforce management\n\nInstead of cobbling together different point solutions for different processes, “our entire HR function is run on Rippling,” Natasha said. She uses Rippling for every step of the onboarding process, including distributing and storing tax documents and confidentiality agreements, setting new hires up for payroll, enrolling them in healthcare and 401(k) plans, and running background checks.\n\n“There’s no other platform that we use that’s central in the same way,” Natasha said. “Rippling is our one HR platform that every single employee uses.”\n\nIn addition to unifying HR systems, Sierra takes even further advantage of Rippling’s all-in-one platform by unifying employee processes across IT and finance. This includes using Device Management to provision laptops during onboarding and Expense Management to process employee reimbursements.\n\n\"We've been growing fast and Rippling's had no issues keeping pace. It gives every new hire peace of mind so we can focus on supporting our customers,” said Clay.\n\n03\n\nEfficiency gains for admins\n\nThe upshot of having so many systems under the same roof? Automated workflows that yield massive time-savings for Sierra’s HR team.\n\nNatasha appreciates that Rippling serves as a repository for all employee data, which eliminates the need for any manual payroll calculations. And while she used to manually register remote employees for state taxes, Rippling PEO now handles it without her lifting a finger.\n\n“I’m in Rippling every day,” she said. “It’s nice to have a dashboard checklist of things I need to accomplish as an admin. Rippling helps keep me on track.”\n\nAnd Nittai (on Sierra’s Business Ops team) finds Rippling to be a welcome upgrade from Gusto, which he used in prior roles at other companies but had to supplement with other systems (like Kandji for device management and a separate payroll provider for international contractors) to manage and pay his workforce. “We felt the overhead of having separate systems. You’re basically duplicating the same amount of work,” he said. “I’m a fan of being able to centralize.”\n\nRippling provides the two-person ops team “time savings and efficiency,” Natasha said. “I think it’s a really convenient platform.”\n\nOur entire HR function is run on Rippling… There’s no other platform we use that’s central in the same way.\n\nNatasha Clare\n\nHead of Operations at Sierra",
      "# [What Is Payroll?](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/payroll)\nWhat payroll entails\n\nThe key purpose of payroll is to make sure your employees are paid accurately and on time while complying with various legal requirements. More specifically, that means:\n\nCalculating wages\n\nDetermine the correct amount of pay for each employee based on their hours worked, salary, wage, or commission structure. This also includes accounting for overtime, bonuses, and any other compensation.\n\nCalculating and filing taxes\n\nCalculate, withhold, and remit the correct taxes, which can include federal, state, and local taxes, depending on where your business and your employee(s) are located. Employers are required to file payroll taxes with the appropriate agencies and provide employees with the necessary tax documents by the correct deadlines.\n\nCompliance\n\nAdhere to federal, state, and local labor and employment laws, including minimum wage requirements, overtime pay regulations, workers’ compensation enrollment, and proper classification of employees and independent contractors. It’s up to employers to stay up-to-date on these laws and any changes to legislation to avoid potential penalties.\n\nRecordkeeping\n\nMaintain accurate records of employee hours, wages, tax withholdings, and other payroll-related information. These records are important to have on hand for tax filings and in case you get audited or need to resolve any payroll disputes.\n\nRunning payroll: 2 methods\n\nThere are two primary methods for running payroll: manually calculating payroll or using a payroll system. Each method has its own benefits and considerations, which we’ll explore in more detail below.\n\nCalculating payroll manually\n\nCalculating payroll manually involves using spreadsheets or other manual methods to track employee hours, calculate wages, and determine tax withholdings. This method is most often used by small businesses with a limited number of employees.\n\nHow to run payroll manually\n\nGather employee information. Collect necessary payroll information such as hours worked, salary rates, and any bonuses or commissions.\n\nReview and approve time sheets. If your employees are paid hourly and not salaried, review their time sheets and compare them to employee schedules to check for errors.\n\nCalculate gross pay. Multiply the hours worked by the hourly rate, or use the salary amount, adding any bonuses or commissions.\n\nCalculate and withhold income taxes. Calculate income tax withholdings (federal, state, and local, if applicable based on where the employee lives and their allowances. You can use the IRS Withholding Estimator to determine how much to withhold for federal income tax, and check with your employee’s state tax assessor’s office for the correct state income tax withholding rate, if they have a state income tax.\n\nCalculate other deductions. Calculate Social Security taxes, Medicare, federal and state unemployment taxes, and any other payroll deductions (e.g., retirement plan contributions, health insurance).\n\nCalculate net pay. Subtract the total deductions from the gross pay to determine the net pay.\n\nPay employees. Issue payments to employees each payday. You can pay them via paper checks, by direct deposit into their bank accounts, or by whatever payment method you mutually agree upon.\n\nRecordkeeping. Maintain accurate records of all payroll calculations and payments, and give pay stubs to employees for their own records.\n\nUsing a payroll system\n\nA payroll system automates the payroll process, reducing the risk of errors and saving time. Payroll systems can handle calculations, tax filings, direct deposits, and recordkeeping. Some even have time tracking, employee benefits like PTO and sick time, integrations with accounting software, garnishments, and other convenient features that make payroll easier for everyone from startups to small business owners to enterprise companies.\n\nTypes of payroll systems\n\nThere are several different types of payroll systems businesses can choose from, based on their needs and resources.\n\nProfessional payroll services\n\nProfessional payroll services provide full-service solutions for managing payroll, which can be a good choice for businesses that either don’t have a full human resources team, or have limited in-house HR resources.\n\nBy outsourcing payroll to a professional service, businesses can have a complete hands-off experience that includes all aspects of payroll processing: wage calculations, deductions, direct deposits, and generating payroll reports. Additionally, full-service payroll providers often offer HR support, such as managing employee benefits, handling workers' comp, and assisting with compliance, giving your business more flexibility to focus on its core operations.\n\nPayroll software\n\nPayroll software allows businesses to manage payroll in-house using automated tools. These modern payroll solutions can typically handle calculations, tax filings, and direct deposits, giving businesses flexibility and control while saving them time and effort.\n\nHybrid payroll systems\n\nHybrid payroll systems combine elements of both professional services and payroll software. Businesses can use software for routine tasks while relying on professional services for complex issues or compliance support.\n\nHow to choose a payroll system\n\nWhen choosing a payroll system, consider factors such as the size of your business, your budget, the complexity of your payroll needs, and the level of expertise you need to manage your payroll. Carefully evaluate the features, costs, and support options of different systems to find the best fit for your business.\n\nWhat to consider when selecting a payroll system\n\n1. Your business needs\n\nSize of your business: Small businesses might benefit from simple, self-service payroll solutions, while larger organizations may require comprehensive, full-service options.\n\nComplexity of your payroll needs: Consider the complexity of your payroll needs, such as multiple pay rates, bonuses, commissions, and overtime calculations.\n\n2. Payroll providers\n\nReputation and reliability: Research payroll providers and read reviews to make sure they have a good track record of reliability and customer satisfaction.\n\nServices offered: Look for providers that offer the payroll management features you need, like tax filing, compliance, or human resources support.\n\n3. Pricing\n\nCost structure: Understand the pricing model of each payroll provider or software. Some charge a flat fee per month, while others may charge per payroll run or per employee you onboard.\n\nHidden fees: Be aware of any additional costs, such as fees for tax filing, direct deposits, or customer support.\n\n4. Integrations\n\nAccounting software: Does the payroll system integrate with your existing accounting software?\n\nTime tracking systems: If the payroll software doesn’t offer time tracking as a feature, make sure it integrates with a time tracking system to automate the process of calculating hours worked.\n\n5. User experience\n\nIntuitive interface: The payroll system should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for your HR team to navigate and use.\n\nSelf-service options: Self-service features, like an app or employee dashboard, allow employees to access their pay stubs and tax forms, and update personal information without needing HR intervention.\n\n6. Customer support\n\nAvailability: See if the payroll provider offers reliable customer support to assist with any issues or questions that may arise.\n\nResources: Look for additional resources such as training materials, webinars, and tutorials to help your team get the most out of the system.\n\nPayroll taxes\n\nPayroll taxes are the mandatory contributions that employers and employees make to fund various government programs. It’s usually up to employers to deduct them from employees’ paychecks and file and pay them on employees’ behalf. Here’s a breakdown of the different types of payroll taxes you’ll need to know.\n\nFICA taxes\n\nFICA, a type of federal tax, includes Social Security and Medicare. Both employers and employees contribute to these taxes. The current rates are 6.2% for Social Security and 1.45% for Medicare, with employers matching these contributions.\n\nUnemployment taxes\n\nUnemployment taxes fund state and federal unemployment insurance programs. Employers are responsible for paying these taxes, which vary based on the state and the employer's experience rating.\n\nIncome taxes\n\nIncome taxes are withheld from employees' wages and paid to federal, state, and local tax authorities. Employers must accurately calculate and withhold these taxes based on employees' earnings and tax withholdings.\n\nFrequently asked questions about payroll\n\nStill have questions about payroll? Learn more in the FAQs below.\n\nWhat is the difference between gross pay and net pay?\n\nGross pay is the total amount of money earned by an employee before any deductions, such as taxes, health insurance, and retirement contributions. Net pay is the amount of money an employee takes home after all deductions have been subtracted from the gross pay.\n\nHow often should payroll be processed?\n\nPayroll can be processed on various schedules, including weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly. The frequency depends on the employer's policies and the nature of the business. Consistency in payroll runs helps ensure timely payment to employees and compliance with labor laws.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using a payroll service provider?\n\nUsing a payroll service provider can save time and reduce errors by automating payroll calculations, tax filings, and compliance tasks. It also ensures that payroll is processed accurately and on time, helps maintain compliance with labor laws, and provides support for human resources functions.\n\nHow do payroll systems integrate with accounting software?\n\nPayroll systems can integrate with accounting software to streamline financial management. This integration allows for automatic synchronization of payroll data with the company's general ledger, reducing the need for manual data entry and minimizing the risk of errors.\n\nWhy is payroll tax compliance important?\n\nPayroll tax compliance is crucial to avoid legal penalties and fines. Employers must accurately calculate, withhold, and remit federal, state, and local taxes. Compliance with tax regulations ensures that employees receive accurate tax forms and that the business adheres to legal requirements.\n\nWhat are the potential penalties for payroll errors?\n\nPenalties for payroll errors can include fines, interest on unpaid taxes, and legal action. Errors such as incorrect tax withholdings, late tax payments, or misclassification of employees can result in significant financial and legal consequences for the business.",
      "# [Commitment to clients by The Rippling Team on 2024-04-03](https://www.rippling.com/blog/jpmorgan)\nOn March 9, 2023, in response to a regional banking crisis, the FDIC froze the accounts of Silicon Valley Bank, Rippling's then-financial services provider, and the clock was ticking to get clients the money they needed to pay their employees. Without hesitation, Rippling authorized the release of $130 million of the company’s own capital as a stopgap, but there was still the matter of actually issuing the payments. Thankfully Rippling had a contingency plan in place, which included an existing partnership with J.P. Morgan. Together, Rippling and J.P. Morgan established secure payment rails, beat the clock, and paid everyone on time.\n\nThe process of moving money across international borders for payroll and other transactions involves navigating myriad country-specific regulations and banking systems, each with its own unique requirements for currency exchange and tax compliance. This complexity necessitates a banking partner that can provide extensive global coverage and a sophisticated suite of services to handle the intricacies of navigating international payments. In these matters, there is arguably no better partner of choice than J.P. Morgan.\n\nTheir truly exceptional client service solidified Rippling’s confidence in J.P.

      "# [What is Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)?](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/byod)\nIn the era of smartphones, tablets, and ultraportable laptops, the line between personal and work devices is blurring. Employees increasingly expect to use their own devices for work, whether in the office or remotely. This trend, known as Bring Your Own Device (BYOD), has taken the business world by storm—but what exactly is BYOD, and how can organizations navigate its benefits and challenges?\n\nThis piece takes a deep dive into the world of BYOD. Whether you're an IT professional, a business leader, or an employee looking to understand BYOD better, this guide has you covered.\n\nWhat is BYOD?\n\nBYOD refers to the policy of allowing employees to use their personal devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, personal computers, or even smartwatches, for work purposes. This can include accessing company email, documents, and applications on their own devices rather than using company-provided equipment.\n\nBYOD has become increasingly popular in recent years, with 82% of organizations allowing it and 68% of them seeing a boost in productivity after implementation. This tells you how significant the impact of BYOD can be on workplace efficiency and flexibility. The trend reflects the growing consumerization of IT, where powerful and ubiquitous mobile devices are driving changes in the workplace.\n\nHistory of BYOD\n\nThe BYOD trend began to gain traction in the late 2000s with the rise of smartphones and tablets. As these devices became more capable and affordable, employees started using them for work tasks.\n\nIn 2009, Intel became one of the first major companies to embrace BYOD. They allowed employees to use their own smartphones for work, as long as they adhered to security policies. Other companies soon followed suit, and BYOD became a hot topic in the tech industry. Today, BYOD is commonplace, with many companies having formal policies and management strategies in place.\n\nBenefits of BYOD\n\nBYOD offers several potential benefits for both employees and employers:\n\nIncreased productivity: Employees are often more comfortable and proficient with their own devices, which can lead to increased efficiency and productivity. They can work more flexibly and responsively, without being limited by corporate-issued devices. One study found that BYOD employees work an average of two extra hours per day.\n\nCost savings: By allowing employees to use their own phones and devices, companies can reduce hardware and support costs. They can avoid the upfront costs of purchasing devices and the ongoing expenses of maintaining and upgrading them. Another study by Cisco found that companies can save an average of $350 per employee per year with BYOD.\n\nEmployee satisfaction: BYOD programs can contribute to higher employee satisfaction and morale, as they provide more flexibility and autonomy in how work gets done. Employees appreciate the ability to choose their own devices and work in a way that suits them best. For instance, an Android user may prefer the customization options compared to a company-mandated iPhone.\n\nBusiness agility: BYOD can enable more responsive and agile workflows, as employees can access work resources from anywhere at any time. This is particularly valuable for remote workers and those who travel frequently.\n\nChallenges and risks of BYOD\n\nDespite its benefits, BYOD also introduces some challenges and risks:\n\nSecurity risks: Personal devices may lack the same level of device security as company-managed devices, increasing the risk of data breaches, malware infections, vulnerabilities, and unauthorized access. Employees may not have the latest security patches or may use unsecured Wi-Fi networks, exposing corporate data to threats.\n\nCompliance issues: BYOD can make it harder to ensure compliance with data privacy and industry regulations, as corporate data resides on personal devices and may intermingle with personal data. This is particularly challenging for heavily regulated industries like healthcare and finance.\n\nSupport complexity: Supporting a wide range of devices and platforms can be challenging for IT teams, leading to increased workload and costs. They may need to troubleshoot issues on unfamiliar devices and ensure compatibility with corporate apps and systems.\n\nEmployee privacy concerns: BYOD blurs the line between personal and work data, raising concerns about employee privacy and the extent of employer access to personal information. Employees may worry about their company monitoring their personal activities or accessing private data.\n\nDeveloping effective BYOD policies\n\nTo mitigate the risks and challenges of BYOD, organizations need to develop clear and comprehensive BYOD policies. Key elements of a BYOD policy include:\n\nAcceptable use guidelines\n\nClearly define what employees can and cannot do with their devices when accessing corporate resources. This may include restrictions on certain apps, websites, or activities. The device policy could also cover both company-provided SIM cards and employee-owned SIMs/eSIMs.\n\nSecurity requirements\n\nSpecify the minimum security measures for BYOD devices, such as passcode requirements, encryption, and antivirus software. Also, outline the processes for reporting lost or stolen devices. The IT department should tailor requirements to the various device types, operating systems like iOS and Android, and ownership models.\n\nData ownership and privacy\n\nClarify who owns the data on BYOD devices (personal vs. corporate) and the extent of the company's access to employee personal information. Be transparent about any monitoring or management of personal devices.\n\nSupport and maintenance\n\nDefine the level of technical support provided for BYOD devices and the employee's responsibility for maintaining and updating their device. Specify any reimbursement or stipend policies for work-related device expenses.\n\nTermination procedures\n\nOutline the steps taken when an employee leaves the company or is terminated, such as revoking access to corporate resources and wiping corporate data from the device.\n\nAn effective BYOD policy should strike a balance between security and usability, protecting corporate data while minimizing the burden on employees. It's also crucial to involve key stakeholders, such as IT, HR, and legal in the policy development process to ensure all perspectives are considered.\n\nImplementing BYOD security solutions\n\nTo secure BYOD devices and protect corporate data, organizations can implement various security solutions:\n\nMobile device management (MDM)\n\nMDM software allows IT to manage, monitor, and secure employee-owned devices centrally. MDM can enforce policies, remotely wipe data, and segregate personal and corporate data. Examples of MDM solutions include Rippling, JumpCloud, and Jamf.\n\nEnterprise mobility management (EMM)\n\nEMM is a comprehensive approach to securing and managing mobile devices, apps, and content. It includes MDM, mobile application management (MAM), and mobile content management (MCM) capabilities. EMM solutions help organizations enforce cybersecurity policies, distribute corporate apps, and protect sensitive data.\n\nUnified endpoint management (UEM)\n\nUEM takes EMM a step further by providing a single platform to manage and secure all endpoint devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. UEM solutions offer features like app management, content management, and identity management.\n\nIdentity and access management (IAM)\n\nIAM solutions help secure access to corporate resources by enforcing strong authentication, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), and controlling access based on user identity and device posture. IAM solutions can integrate with MDM/UEM/EMM platforms to provide an additional layer of security.\n\nVirtual private networks (VPNs)\n\nVPNs create a secure, encrypted tunnel between BYOD devices and corporate networks, protecting data in transit from interception and unauthorized access. Many MDM/UEM/EMM solutions include VPN capabilities, or organizations can use standalone VPN solutions.\n\nData loss prevention (DLP)\n\nDLP solutions help organizations identify, monitor, and protect sensitive data across endpoints, networks, and cloud services. DLP can prevent accidental data leaks and intentional data theft by blocking unauthorized access, copying, or sharing of sensitive information.\n\nBest practices for managing BYOD programs\n\nSuccessfully managing a BYOD program requires ongoing effort and attention. Some best practices include:\n\nEducate employees: Provide regular training and communication on BYOD policies, security best practices, and the importance of protecting corporate data. Make sure employees understand their responsibilities and the consequences of non-compliance.\n\nStreamline onboarding: Make the BYOD enrollment process as simple and user-friendly as possible. Provide clear instructions and support to help employees get set up quickly and securely.\n\nMonitor and enforce policies: Regularly monitor BYOD devices for compliance with security policies and take prompt action on any violations. Use MDM and other tools to automate policy enforcement and alert on potential issues.\n\nKeep policies up to date: Regularly review and update BYOD policies to keep pace with new threats, technologies, and business needs. Involve key stakeholders in the review process and communicate any changes to employees.\n\nFoster collaboration: Encourage open communication and collaboration between IT, HR, legal, and other teams involved in BYOD management. Regular meetings and shared goals can help ensure everyone is working together effectively.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nIs BYOD good or bad?\n\nBYOD has both advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, it can increase employee satisfaction and productivity, reduce hardware costs for the company, and enable more flexible working arrangements. However, BYOD also introduces security risks, compliance challenges, and support complexities that organizations need to carefully manage.\n\nWhat does BYOD cover?\n\nBYOD policies typically cover several key areas, including:\n\nAcceptable devices and use guidelines\n\nSecurity requirements and incident reporting procedures\n\nData ownership and privacy expectations\n\nSupport and maintenance responsibilities\n\nOnboarding and termination processes\n\nWhat are the minimum requirements for BYOD?\n\nThe minimum requirements for BYOD typically include:\n\nA compatible device (e.g., smartphone, tablet, laptop) that meets the company's security standards.\n\nAgreeing to the company's BYOD policy and acceptable use guidelines.\n\nInstalling required security software, such as MDM clients or endpoint protection.\n\nKeeping the device updated with the latest operating system and security patches.\n\nUsing strong authentication methods, such as MFA, to access corporate resources.\n\nWhat does BYOD have to do with authentication?\n\nAuthentication is a critical component of BYOD security. When employees use personal devices for work, it's essential to ensure that only authorized users can access company data. This typically involves implementing MFA which requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access. For example, an employee might need to enter a password and a one-time code sent to their registered mobile device. This helps prevent unauthorized access even if a password is compromised.",
      "# [What Is a P60?](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/p60)\nWhat is a P60 used for?\n\nA P60 End of Year Certificate serves multiple purposes:\n\nProof of income\n\nA record of the amount of tax an employee paid during the year\n\nProof of how much tax was deducted for employees seeking tax rebates after overpaying\n\nA supporting document when filing a self-assessment tax return\n\nEmployers issue P60s to their employees each year. This important document can be used to prove income when applying for loans, mortgages, or other financial purposes, or for claiming a tax refund, or applying for tax credits.\n\nWhere do employees get their P60?\n\nEmployees receive their P60 from their current employer at the end of the financial year. They can also access their P60 information online via their HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) personal tax account. Employers are required by law to provide this document.\n\nWhen do employees get their P60?\n\nEmployees typically receive their P60 after the end of the tax year, which runs from April 6 to April 5 of the following year. Employers are required to issue the P60 no later than 31st May following the end of the tax year, which gives employees enough time to handle their tax affairs.\n\nWhere do employers get P60s to give their employees?\n\nEmployers can use payroll software to quickly and easily generate P60 forms—as well as payslips and other tax documents—for their employees. Most modern payroll systems automatically generate P60s for all employees at the end of the tax year. Employers may also access P60 templates through HMRC or third-party PAYE tools if needed.\n\nWhat information is on a P60 form?\n\nA P60 form contains crucial details about an employee's earnings and the taxes paid during the year. It includes:\n\nThe employee’s personal details, including their name, tax code, payroll number, and National Insurance number\n\nThe employee’s gross earnings, take-home pay, and income tax paid\n\nIf the employee changed jobs during the tax year, their gross earnings and tax paid for both jobs\n\nThe employee’s National Insurance contributions\n\nAny statutory payments the employee received, such as maternity pay (or paternity pay) or statutory sick pay\n\nStudent loan repayments the employee made (or any other untaxed loan deductions, if applicable)\n\nWhat should an employer do if they make a mistake on a P60?\n\nIf an employer makes a mistake on a P60, they or their payroll department can issue a new copy of the form with the error(s) corrected. But the employee should also carefully examine the P60 and contact HMRC to notify them of the mistake. That way, HMRC can provide guidance and make sure the employee’s tax records are updated across the board.\n\nWhat happens if an employee loses their P60?\n\nIf an employee loses their P60, they should first request a replacement from their employer, who may be able to issue a copy. However, employers are not legally required to provide duplicates. Alternatively, employees can view their P60 information through their HMRC personal tax account.\n\nFrequently asked questions about P60s\n\nIs a P60 different from a P45?\n\nYes. A P60 is issued at the end of the tax year and reflects the total tax paid, while a P45 form is given to an employee who is leaving their job. It shows the tax paid up to their leaving date with their previous employer and helps their new employer set up their payroll with the correct tax information.\n\nDo self-employed workers get P60s?\n\nUsually, no. Self-employed workers, also known as independent contractors or sole traders, are responsible for completing their own tax returns and are not issued a P60 by any employer. The exception is those who operate a limited company and pay themselves a salary. In that case, they should generate a P60 for themselves at the end of the tax year.\n\nDo retirees get P60s?\n\nP60s keep a record of taxable income, so if a retiree receives money from their pension contributions that’s taxable in their retirement, they’ll still receive a P60. In this case, though, they’ll generally receive the P60 from their pension provider, not an employer.\n\nWhat happens if an employer doesn’t issue a P60 to an employee?\n\nIf an employer fails to issue a P60, the employee should contact the employer and request one. If the issue persists, the employee can report it to HMRC. Providing a P60 is a legal obligation for employers, and failure to deliver the forms to your employees on time may lead to fines from HMRC—£300 initially when P60s are issued late, with £60 added every day until employees receive their tax documents.\n\nWhat is a Starter Checklist?\n\nA Starter Checklist is used by a new employer to gather key tax information when someone starts a new job. It helps determine the correct tax code to apply and is used when a P45 is not available.",
      "# [What Is Overtime?](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/overtime)\nWhat are overtime hours?\n\nOvertime hours refer to any hours worked by an employee beyond their standard work schedule. In most cases, this is defined as working more than 40 hours in a single workweek. Some industries or employers might have different thresholds for overtime, such as daily overtime for working more than 8 hours in a day, depending on local labor laws and company policies.\n\nWhat is overtime pay?\n\nOvertime pay is the additional compensation qualifying employees receive for working overtime hours. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is an American law that mandates that non-exempt employees must be paid at least one and a half times their regular hourly rate for any hours worked over 40 in a workweek. This higher rate is commonly referred to as \"time and a half.\"\n\nWho is eligible for overtime pay?\n\nEligibility for overtime pay depends on the employee's classification under overtime laws, most notably the FLSA.\n\nExempt employees\n\nExempt employees are typically not eligible for overtime pay (or minimum wage). These employees fall into categories such as executive, administrative, professional, outside sales, and certain computer employees. To qualify as exempt, these employees must meet specific criteria regarding their job duties and receive a salary that meets or exceeds a certain threshold set by the Department of Labor. The FLSA also doesn’t require agricultural workers to receive overtime pay.\n\nNon-exempt employees\n\nNon-exempt employees are eligible for overtime pay. These employees are usually paid on an hourly basis and do not meet the exemption criteria. Non-exempt employees must receive overtime pay at a rate of at least one and a half times their regular hourly wage for any hours worked over 40 in a workweek.\n\nIndependent contractors\n\nIndependent contractors are not eligible for overtime pay under the FLSA. They are considered self-employed and are typically paid per project or assignment rather than by the hour. As such, they are responsible for negotiating their rates and managing their work hours.\n\nHow to calculate overtime pay\n\nCalculating overtime pay is usually pretty straightforward:\n\nDetermine the employee’s regular rate of pay: Identify the employee's regular hourly wage. For salaried employees, divide their weekly salary by the number of hours they are expected to work per week (typically 40 hours).\n\nCalculate the overtime rate: Multiply the regular hourly rate by 1.5 to find the overtime rate. For example, if the regular hourly rate is $20, the overtime rate would be $20x1.5, or $30.\n\nCalculate how many overtime hours the employee worked: Determine the number of hours of overtime worked. This is the total hours worked in the week minus 40 hours.\n\nCalculate the employee’s overtime pay: Multiply the overtime hours by the overtime rate. For example, if an employee worked 45 hours in a week with a regular hourly rate of $20, the calculation would be:\n\nOvertime hours = 45-40 = 5 hours\n\nOvertime pay = 5 hours x $30 (overtime rate) = $150\n\nCalculate the employee’s total pay: Add the regular pay and the overtime pay. For the example above:\n\nRegular pay = 40 hours x $20 (regular pay rate) = $800\n\nOvertime pay = $150\n\nTotal pay = $800 + $150 = $950\n\nState laws regarding overtime\n\nWhile the FLSA covers all of America, states have made their own laws to increase protections or make more specific rules about who is eligible for overtime pay and when.\n\nCalifornia has the strictest overtime laws, requiring employers to pay double an employee’s regular pay rate if they work more than 12 hours in a day or more than eight hours on their seventh consecutive day of work.\n\nThese states have daily overtime rules:\n\nAlaska: 1.5 times the regular pay rate if an employee works more than eight hours in a day.\n\nCalifornia: 1.5 times the regular pay rate if an employee works more than eight hours in a day.\n\nColorado: 1.5 times the regular pay rate if an employee works more than 12 hours in a day or 12 consecutive hours.\n\nFlorida: Overtime pay is required for manual laborers who work more than 10 hours in a day.\n\nNevada: 1.5 times the regular pay rate if an employee works more than eight hours in a day and earns less than 1.5 times the minimum wage.\n\nOregon: 1.5 times the regular pay rate if an employee works more than 10 hours a day in mill, factory, or manufacturing jobs, or eight hours a day in timber jobs.\n\nFrequently asked questions about overtime\n\nWhat counts as overtime hours?\n\nOvertime hours typically refer to any hours worked beyond the standard 40-hour workweek. However, some states or employers may have different thresholds, such as requiring overtime pay for hours worked over 8 in a single day. It’s important to check local labor laws and company policies for specific definitions of overtime hours.\n\nAre salaried employees eligible for overtime pay?\n\nNot all salaried employees are exempt from overtime. Eligibility depends on the specific job duties and salary level. Exempt employees, such as those in executive, administrative, or professional roles, generally don’t qualify for overtime pay.\n\nHow do nondiscretionary bonuses affect overtime pay?\n\nNondiscretionary bonuses are bonuses that are promised or expected as part of an employee’s compensation. These bonuses are included in the calculation of the regular rate of pay, but under the FLSA, they don’t count toward determining overtime pay.\n\nDo part-time employees receive overtime pay?\n\nPart-time employees are entitled to overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours in a workweek. The same rules that apply to full-time employees also apply to part-time employees regarding overtime eligibility and compensation.\n\nWhere can employers and employees learn more about overtime laws?\n\nThe Department of Labor (dol.gov) has multiple fact sheets available about overtime and overtime pay.",

      "# [What Is an Applicant Tracking System (ATS)?](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/ats)\nHow do applicant tracking systems work?\n\nApplicant tracking systems (ATS) are software solutions designed to streamline the recruitment process by helping hiring teams manage and organize candidate information.\n\nApplicant tracking software is typically cloud-based. These platforms allow recruiters and HR professionals to store and track candidate information, like resumes, cover letters, and job applications, in one centralized location. By automating many aspects of the hiring process, an ATS helps companies quickly identify the best candidates and attract top talent in their fields.\n\nThe system works by analyzing resumes and applications, comparing them to job descriptions, and ranking candidates based on how well they meet the criteria for open positions. Talent acquisition teams can then use the ATS to manage candidate communication, schedule interviews, and track each applicant’s progress through the hiring pipeline.\n\nSome ATS systems also generate reports and real-time analytics to help companies optimize their recruitment strategies.\n\nHow do employers use applicant tracking systems to find candidates?\n\nEmployers use applicant tracking systems to streamline the process of finding and hiring the right candidates. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how ATS can be used to recruit new hires:\n\nCreating and posting job listings. Employers start by creating job postings within the ATS. The system makes it easier to distribute job listings across multiple job boards, career sites, and social media platforms like LinkedIn, so they can reach a broader audience and attract a larger pool of candidates.\n\nCollecting applications. As candidates apply, the ATS automatically collects their information. The system then parses resumes and organizes them into candidate profiles, making it easier for hiring managers and human resources teams to review applications.\n\nScreening and assessing candidates. ATS systems often come with tools for initial candidate assessments, which can include keyword searches that match resumes against job requirements, or scoring algorithms that rank candidates based on their qualifications.\n\nManaging communication. Throughout the process, the ATS helps manage communication with candidates. Automated messaging features can be used to send updates, schedule interviews, and keep candidates engaged and informed.\n\nTracking progress. The ATS allows hiring teams to track each candidate's progress through the recruitment pipeline, from the application stage to sending offer letters. The system also facilitates team collaboration by allowing hiring managers and HR to share notes and feedback on each candidate.\n\nOnboarding. Once a candidate is selected, the ATS should, ideally, assist with the onboarding process by making sure you already have a head start on gathering your new hire’s information and documentation.\n\nWhat features should an applicant tracking system have?\n\nWhen selecting an applicant tracking system, look for features that will support and improve every part of your recruitment process. Here are some key features to look for:\n\nHeadcount planning you can sync across your organization\n\nJob description templates you can customize\n\nJob posting across multiple job boards and career sites\n\nEmployee referrals and referral management\n\nResume parsing for efficient candidate screening\n\nCandidate assessments and scoring algorithms\n\nInterview scheduling tools to coordinate with candidates and hiring teams\n\nMessaging for candidate communication\n\nAutomated workflows to eliminate time-consuming administrative work (like re-entering candidate information at different steps)\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) features to optimize candidate matching\n\nData and metrics for tracking recruitment performance\n\nMany modern recruiting teams consider ATS software to be one of their most essential tools. By automating the process of tracking and screening applicants, an ATS helps companies focus on finding the most qualified candidates for their job openings.\n\nFor candidates\n\nATS solutions offer both advantages and drawbacks for job seekers:\n\nFor recruiters\n\nSimilarly, ATS software provides benefits and drawbacks for recruiting teams:\n\nHow to choose an applicant tracking system\n\nWhen selecting recruiting software, look for a solution that aligns with your organization's needs and your overall hiring strategy. The steps below should help you get started.\n\n1. Assess your needs\n\nBefore choosing an ATS, thoroughly evaluate your organization’s needs.\n\nGather input from key stakeholders within the HR and recruitment teams, as well as other departments that may interact with the system. Understanding the unique challenges your company faces in recruitment will help you identify the most important features you need in an ATS. Keep in mind that selecting and implementing an ATS can be time-consuming, so it’s important to choose a system that meets both your immediate and long-term needs.\n\n2. Set a budget\n\nConsider the pricing of different ATS options and how they fit within your company’s financial constraints. Weigh the cost of the software against the potential return on investment, such as improved efficiency and reduced time-to-hire.\n\n3. Review options\n\nOnce you have assessed your needs and set a budget, you’re ready to start reviewing your options.\n\nLook for a system that offers functionality that aligns with your recruitment goals and offers these key features:\n\nIntegrations with other tools in your HR tech stack, like your HRIS or HCM software, background check software, or talent management platform\n\nEase of use, so it doesn’t require extensive training or have a high learning curve for different team members in your organization to use it\n\nHolistic improvement across your entire recruitment process, including the candidate experience. The goal is for your ATS software to make recruitment better for your employees and candidates, so a good user experience from both sides is key.\n\nFrequently asked questions about applicant tracking systems\n\nStill have questions about ATS providers? Learn more in the FAQs below.\n\nWhat’s the difference between an ATS and a CRM?\n\nAn Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is primarily used to manage the recruitment process, from posting jobs to tracking applications and managing candidate information. A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, on the other hand, is designed to manage interactions with clients or customers. In recruitment, a CRM can be used to build and maintain relationships with passive candidates, nurture talent pools, and engage potential hires over time, complementing the functions of an ATS.\n\nCan an ATS help with diversity hiring initiatives?\n\nYes, many ATS platforms include features that support diversity hiring initiatives, like blind recruitment tools that remove identifying information from resumes and analytics to track diversity metrics.\n\nIs an ATS suitable for small businesses?\n\nYes, an ATS can be beneficial for small businesses by helping to streamline the recruitment process, save time, and improve candidate management. Many ATS providers offer scalable solutions with flexible pricing, making them accessible to small businesses with varying recruitment needs."

      "# Post ID vcfyu7: I chose Rippling and highly regret it with +246 score by [(Rlvantage, Reddit, 2022-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/)\nThis is actually my first post here, but you guys are an amazing, helpful community and I wanted to share my experience so others are aware of how r/Rippling operates. I did my research before choosing Rippling, but apparently not enough. I went over my contract in depth before signing with Rippling, but apparently not good enough. Hopefully by reading my cautionary tale, I can prevent someone from making the same mistake. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nWe started with Rippling in March, and at first everything was going great. They actually have a really good setup to streamline the HR side of things with small businesses, and have some good extra technology features (for a cost) that I have not seen similar companies offer. We had 9 employees to start, and were told that Rippling charges per employee per month. So if at any time we hired more employees, we would obviously pay more that month for the additonal employees, which we were fine with. After several Zoom sessions with our Account Executive, we signed a 15mos contract.\n\nSince March we have gained and lost employees (due to us re-structuring the company), leaving our current total number of employees at 15. Well this month we were charged $800 more than what our usual bill is. When we reached out because we were obviously confused, we were told the higher charge was because Rippling is charging us for the number of employees we have, which is 25. We quickly said no that is not correct, we only have 15 employees. To which the response from Rippling was, \"well you once had 25 employees, so you need to continue to pay for 25 employees even if you don't have 25 employees\". \n\nWell seeing how Rippling is now telling us we have to pay an extra $800 per month for employees we do not have, and do not plan on getting for the next 12 Months, we wanted to find out if there was a way to possibly just reduce our head count back to 9. We figured we could just go back to Gusto with the rest of our employees, as they were always great and upfront about fees and cost. \n\nWhen we inquired about reducing our head count back to the original number, as we are a small business and cannot afford that extra cost per month, we were told that the  only way possible to do that is if we sign a 2-3 years additional contract with Rippling. We also were told that if we wanted to keep the employee count at 15, and just pay for the current number of employees we have, we would have to sign an additional 2-3 year contract to do so. \n\nSo apparently we are either stuck figuring out how to pay them an additional $800 per month for the next year, or stuck dealing with them for an additional 2-3 years no matter what happens with our business. \n\nI feel like Rippling is preying on my business and I don't know what to do. You can't speak to anyone by phone, only by email. What sucks about that is the person we've been communicating with only replies once every 24 hours, and just reiterates the same thing over and over again. I've asked legitimate questions as to why this is happening, and never get a direct answer. Worst part is the person I'm speaking to is an Account Executive with the company, so he is definitely trying to push us hard to sign this extended 2-3 year contract, even though we've only been with the company for 3 months. \n\nPlease don't make the mistake we did!\n\n\nTL;DR - Rippling baited and switched on us after being with them for 3 months. Payment for using their services went up over $800 per month unexpectedly on our 3rd month of using them. Rippling stated this is due to us having 25 employees at one point (started with 9, currently at 15), and that for the next 12 months our company will be charged for 25 employees whether we have them or not. The only way for us to be charged for the correct number of employees we have is to sign an additonal 2-3year contract with them, even though we just signed a 15 month contract with them 3 mos ago.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID icero9l with +95 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icero9l/) (in reply to ID vcfyu7):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID icff78j with +31 score by [(Rlvantage, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icff78j/) (in reply to ID icero9l):\nSmart!

After signing you went up to 9. If thier logic stands you shouldn't have to pay for the extra ee's. If they want to charge you more then they need to produce a new contract at that point you can tell them they don't meet your needs anymore.

Think extremely anal and you can also bombard their support with requests.\n\nWhen they fail to respond or resolve all issues, move away to another provider.\n\nDocument everything they fail to do, support request on x day for xy issue had no response, etc.\n\nBy doing this you will be legally protected should they try to go after you for breach of contract.\n\n### Comment ID icf4ien with +7 score by [(Rlvantage, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icf4ien/) (in reply to ID icf39tv):\nThank you for that information\n\n## Comment ID icedjx5 with +39 score by [(CdnPoster, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icedjx5/) (in reply to ID vcfyu7):\nYour company needs to speak with a contract lawyer immediately.\n\nGood luck!!!\n\n### Comment ID icefu07 with +9 score by [(Rlvantage, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icefu07/) (in reply to ID icedjx5):\nThank you!

I haven't seen anyone attempt to explain to you why your contract is structured the way it is. Everyone seems to just be acting like it's unreasonable. I'm not saying it isn't, but I'll add context from 20 years in managed services. \n\nYou engaged in a fixed fee contract for services. You should have signed a scope that explained the services that would be provided, options to scale up, and a term. You alluded to most of that in your op. Once you signed that, the company began work to onboard you into the technology, and subsequently hired people (account execs, help desk techs, sys admins, payroll professionals, etc.) based on having to support 9 users for your business for the next 15 months. \n\nThen, somehow, you restructured within 3 months, going from 9 to 25 employees and back down to 15. \n\nMost managed services companies deal with this in a handful of ways. \n\n1. They up your contracted number of users. Ie: they onboard new users for no upfront cost, and they hire additional personnel to meet the scope you signed originally. You can scale up, you can't scale down. \n2. They continue to bill for the 9, but t&m the shit out of you for everything else. Ie: you'd have probably paid several thousand for the amount of movement you had in 2 months. \n\nYou characterized this well when you said you made a mistake. You got into a managed services contract before you really had your business dialed in, and because you were unfamiliar with how they work, you're in a rough situation. \n\nMy advice: Tell the account exec in email that you did not understand the scaling terms in the contract, and that you do now. You're not going to pay them an extra $800/month for the next 12 months, but you would like to better understand how to avoid this situation for flux/temp staff in the future. If they have no options, execute whatever cancellation terms are in the contract, and inform them of your new provider. \n\nSide note: they're probably going to charge you to transition the services to a new provider.

Glad to see you're reading all this stuff!\n\nRe: onboarding\n\nThere are two types of onboarding and offboarding activities. \n\n1. Onboarding of the operation - this is when you first start your relationship. The firm will come out and document all kinds of things about your operation that they need to perform their scope of work and roll out any technology tool sets that are required. This is either invoiced as a one time line item with a lower per user rate over the term of the agreement, or it is included in the rate over the term of the agreement. If it's included in the per user rate, that will impact drawdown schedules for early termination. Offboardings, likewise are not part of the service. Transfer of accounts, documentation, removal of toolsets, or decommission of assets. All of that requires labor not contemplated in the agreement. \n2. User/employee onboarding/offboardings - this is what happens when you hire/terminate personnel. Documentation updates, account provisioning/termination, workstation set up, training, etc. Non stable state activity. Again, some services may include these at different rates, or give you x amount of these per month/year for free, but you pay after. It sounded (and I could have this wrong) like you didn't have to pay anything when you ramped up to 25 users, you just had the higher rate.\n\nI couldn't find your email comment, but if they aren't willing to accept that you didn't understand the terms, and you do now, then move on.\n\nGood luck with your business!\n\n## Comment ID icej7s5 with +6 score by [(fernguitars, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icej7s5/) (in reply to ID vcfyu7):\nJust get rid of 'em. Number one rule in business is when someone screws up or screws around with the money, there are no second chances.

For clarification for everyone, the way the contract works is if you add an employee, you are basically signing up for that license for the rest of the contract term (whatever is remaining out of the 15 months, where typically the first 3 were free.) That is an un-ideal situation if you are a seasonal employer and may peak during some months and then go back down. User licenses can be re-assigned, but you would need to terminate/offboard an employee before hiring a new one for that to work effectively. So it sounds as though as one time the poster did have a full 25 employees, but now has no use for the excess licenses.  We try to time our start dates if we know someone else is leaving to avoid being stuck with these dead licenses for the rest of the contract term. The quantity reset back down to the actual number of employees as the start of the next contract term, but I agree it is a deeply negative part of their contracts, especially when all services are stacked on top of each other, you end up having to pay for seats for every module whether you use them or not.  If you expect to have a highly fluctuating headcount, It would probably be best to stay away from Rippling or see if you can negotiate a different deal... but unlikely.\n\n## Comment ID kzvjg7s with +1 score by [(RudeEnd8411, Reddit, 2024-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/kzvjg7s/) (in reply to ID vcfyu7):\n**Does anyone have a phone number Rippling?

These MDM systems are designed to help make sure that the computer is updated and that certain things like system encryption are enabled. ￼￼That said, these MDM systems allow Admins to install additional programs, potentially silently, which may be able to track that sort of information should the CEO or law-enforcement deem it necessary. ￼ \n\nIf you don’t want work to know about it, don’t do it on your work computer or using your work accounts. ￼\n\n### Comment ID jgnubve with +7 score by [(Heteronymous, Reddit, 2023-04-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/jgnubve/) (in reply to ID jgmh87v):\nThis, 💯\nOP: Stop being foolish by fishing for answers that are telling you want you want to hear !\n\nu/briancanfixit nailed the truth of it. \n[edit to fix typos]\n\n### Comment ID lo8gyzo with +1 score by [(Okay_sounding, Reddit, 2024-09-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/lo8gyzo/) (in reply to ID jgmh87v):\nThis is great.

They help companies achieve SOC2 and other security/privacy certifications. The Vanta agent which gets installed on workstations collects a bunch of information about the configuration of your workstation and reports back to their platform, which is then used as compliance evidence for their regular audits.\n\nThe MDM likely doesn't do any tracking by default - they're there mostly to enforce certain configuration parameters (disk encryption, screen lock timeouts, etc). That said, it's trivial for them to be able to use the MDM to push out any other type of monitoring that is deemed appropriate by company leadership.\n\nI am not a fan of dragnet-style monitoring, but I have in a few cases, been asked by company leadership to perform some more detailed monitoring on a case-by-case basis - things like collecting browser history, etc. Once an MDM is installed, things like this are very easy.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID jgnl5rp with +1 score by [(alephthirteen, Reddit, 2023-04-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/jgnl5rp/) (in reply to ID 12pi5k6):\nTL;DR Getting a tablet or Chromebook or even a new MacBook Air to browse the web is going to be way cheaper and less disruptive to your life than ***getting a new job***. Don't think about how likely it is they'll catch you. That's the wrong framework. Think about whether being fired would be a hassle. I imagine it would be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like you are in a remote work situation? They probably aren't filming your house--some companies do demand the webcam stays on, but not many--but everything on the device should be **assumed** to be company monitored. Their money, after all.\n\n\\- They quite possibly can see your web history. Not via the MDM itself, but any number of VPNs or filtering softwares do this.- They almost certainly can tell what apps you install.- Whatever security/endpoint software they install could have tons of other capabilities, too. Keystroke monitoring, logging what devices you plug in, etc.\n\nI'm in IT and the guy in charge of keeping the Macs compliant, so I need to be walking the walk. I'm a big fan of watching a YouTube or two in the breakroom over lunch, so people don't chase me down for tickets. I put my iPad in my bag and leave it off until I'm at lunch, put my phone in hotspot, then pull up whatever and watch it. Full division. Not their WiFi network. Not their gear. No one disturbed (except perhaps by my weird laugh).\n\nIf it's something that needs something more power than say, a basic iPad, Android tablet or Chromebook can do, I'd recommend you take a step back and think again, not about whether they'll catch you but whether you should be doing it on company time. Pull out your phone and make a note of the URL if it's a cool article you want to read, then read it later. If it's music, do it on your phone. Other things, maybe just do it after work.\n\nBut I wouldn't be doing Photoshop freelancing or playing Civ 6 or development in Docker containers or whatever on company time, and I can't think what else might need that much power. Most things that might be legit background stuff for WFH could also be done by your phone.\n\nIf you're freelancing, first, check if your contract allows it. And if your contract allows it, you should ***absolutely not*** be doing that on hardware they paid for.\n\n## Comment ID jgoibku with +1 score by [(slykido999, Reddit, 2023-04-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/jgoibku/) (in reply to ID 12pi5k6):\nIf ever you’re concerned about what IT can do to the computer you’re using, you should do it on your own personally owned computer without MDM.\n\n## Comment ID k08fcay with +1 score by [(ratatouille_artist, Reddit, 2023-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/k08fcay/) (in reply to ID 12pi5k6):\nI just installed Vanta myself and luckily it doesn't seem too intrusive.

Listing reasons below.\n\n1. Before even reading this, please read the reviews on [Blind](https://www.teamblind.com/company/Rippling/reviews) especially the ones for shit wlb, management, and culture.\n2. You won't be overworked as an intern(6-7 hrs daily for me), but you will **suffer** as a full timer. My mentor said multiple times hes worked weekends + 12+ hour days to get stuff done and said multiple times he's overloaded and \"dying\" (obv in quotes)\n   1. I've talked with multiple other teams about potential work and **all** of them looked like they wanted out and lost so much hair\n3. You think you're gonna learn stuff because its a unicorn? No fucking way here.\n   1. **Everything** and I mean **Everything** is based on output and getting shit done. No one gives a **fuck** about code quality and all you are is a code monkey.\n   2. There are multiple severe incidents a week and people have gotten fired for causing too many incidents\n      1. An incident where some IC helped => manager didn't like looking bad => the goddamn IC gets fired for helping FFS IMFAO\n   3. Oh yea no one gives a fuck about scaling here. We've lost a significant amount of customers because the product was too slow\n4. You know how Citadel has clawbacks for bonuses if you leave within the first year? Its kind of similar to Rippling but for ur paper stocks. Leave within 1 year and you get nada.\n   1. People have been fired before vesting in order not to pay out.\n5. Management is **draconian.**\n   1. If you're higher up and Parker/C Suite/EM's/PM's don't like you, you're out the door\n   2. Multiple good EM's have been fired\n   3. The new CTO is laying off EM's in order for his previous coworkers to come in and become the first \"VPs\"\n      1. We also fired our past CTO G.B. after a few months lol. Like a horse trying to lead donkeys on redbull to the moon\n6. Your manager does not give a **fuck** about you. You exist for your managers benefit and to look good. They can sideswipe you at any time.\n7. Ripplings RSU share prices given to new hires right now is absolutely overvalued.\n8. People in the India office are completly overworked(everything here is SF related however). Pretty common to see them online at 10-11pm. Was curious a few times late night and saw a few coworkers online at 2-3am.\n9. You may think hey there are no layoffs so it must be good like those overvalued startups.\n   1. We don't have layoffs we have PIPs and random firings instead\n10. You might think the wlb rating  [here](https://www.rippling.com/life) on their website is high and accurate you say?\n11. Those surveys they send arent anonymous. Disagree too much and you get fired. You don't need to include them in the data if they're fired rofl\n12. You think a \"high\" TC is better than all this? Here's the cherry on top\n13. Guess what the CTO doesn't believe in signing bonuses any more and RSU was reduced such that ur TC is around 20% lower. (230-250K tc => 190-210k tc \\[150 base is the same\\]).\n14. Go fucking work for Citadel pay if you want Citadel culture and management lol. No way 150 in base is enough to justify this shit.\n\n### Comment ID j6tqicc with +6 score by [(throwawaynoturtwin, Reddit, 2023-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zmyzdk/what_is_the_consensus_on_rippling/j6tqicc/) (in reply to ID j0eh1zo):\ncurrent FT, obligatory i think experience is very team dependent.

The shares cannot be sold (sometimes you can on equity zen, but does not seem guaranteed), so while you have $X worth of stock, you can't turn that into money.\n\nWhen the company stock IPOs two things happen: the stock can now be sold for cash, and (one would hope) the value of the stock increases. So people that were getting a bunch of 'paper money' (levels.fyi says EM's get about 600k per year) can now turn that into real money, assuming it vested, and if the valuation goes up so does your TC, effectively. A success story is Warby Parker, which seems to have doubled in valuation in the year leading up to their IPO: in this example, the EM's stock would go from 600k to 1.2 million.\n\nThis can go the other way though: sometimes stocks tank. If someone were to sign an offer at Roblox just preIPO (they direct listed, but still), 2/3rds of their RSU has now halved in price.\n\nTL;DR (because I am super rambly)\n\npre-IPO stock is not worth any real money, so companies give it out more freely. When the company IPOs, this fake money becomes real money, and now you have a lot of money.\n\n## Comment ID j0foi0v with +1 score by [(doubletagged, Reddit, 2022-12-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zmyzdk/what_is_the_consensus_on_rippling/j0foi0v/) (in reply to ID zmyzdk):\nIt is definitely not big tech/manga adjacent",

It takes like 25 minutes to manually enroll a device in Rippling and if a user doesn't wait or clicks the wrong things then the configuration gets messed up and there are errors.The more concerning drawback, is that we have all of these reports of the log in screen getting stuck and also the computer getting stuck in sleep mode where the only way to release is through clicking the power button.I've followed up with Rippling support on these issues and there has been no legitimate support. No one who works in support really understands the backend of the tool.",
      "# Post ID 1dschf3: Classical pieces that feature rippling, dreamy arpeggios. (advanced level piano) with +26 score by [(DifferentSky, Reddit, 2024-06-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/1dschf3/classical_pieces_that_feature_rippling_dreamy/)\nHi all, I am interested in working on my arpeggios this summer and wondering what pieces really feature arps. I was thinking there is probably something in the Debussy/Ravel world. But really looking for anything that sounds beautiful, dreamy and also harmonically rich and sophisticated, ect. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!\n\n  \nUpdate: I didn’t expect so many wonderful replies! I can’t thank everyone enough for the great suggestions. I will listen to everything that’s been mentioned. I am thinking of creating a playlist of all of the suggestions!\n\nRealistically, I have to manage my expectations of what I can accomplish and dedicate time to. I am a slow reader and nowhere near being a “concert-level” performer—not even close.\n\nFor the moment, I am thinking of relearning Chopin’s 25/1 and 10/1, for starters. Then, I will examine one or two of the Ravel/Debussy pieces mentioned. \n\nI also want to explore some of the other lesser-known (to me) pieces, even if only for analysis purposes (Rautavaara, Kapustin, Bartok).\n\nI could see myself learning the Bach and Sibelius for calming, more meditative practice. This community is truly amazing!\n\n## Comment ID lb1hjiv with +20 score by [(idion_, Reddit, 2024-06-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/1dschf3/classical_pieces_that_feature_rippling_dreamy/lb1hjiv/) (in reply to ID 1dschf3):\nUne barque sur l'ocean\n\n### Comment ID lb1ina6 with +7 score by [(DifferentSky, Reddit, 2024-06-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/piano/comments/1dschf3/classical_pieces_that_feature_rippling_dreamy/lb1ina6/) (in reply to ID lb1hjiv):\nomg...THIS!

If you are slightly over extruding it will cause those. Sometimes speed is a factor to, needs to be slowed down. Manually calibrate your flow rate first and see if that helps. Make sure when you start a new print the auto calibrate is off. Then try slowing it down. If that doesn't help look into how to tram your bed and or adjust z height. From looking thru some of the other posts here most of them ended up being flow rate.\n\n## Comment ID lflffmo with +6 score by [(Pystawf, Reddit, 2024-07-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BambuLab/comments/1efexnk/rippling_on_first_layer_on_a1/lflffmo/) (in reply to ID 1efexnk):\nThere are 3 screws behind the heatbreak after you remove the nozzle.\n\nTighten them.\n\n### Comment ID lfm154i with +3 score by [(Namelok, Reddit, 2024-07-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BambuLab/comments/1efexnk/rippling_on_first_layer_on_a1/lfm154i/) (in reply to ID lflffmo):\nUnscrew them and look behind the part that pops off.\n\n Mine was broken on the back and a little screw was loose causing the nozzle to push forward a little and the filament to skip in the extruder. \n\nPut that screw back in right and then tighten the three mentioned above and it’s smooth sailing.\n\n#### Comment ID lhue4xx with +3 score by [(bearwhiz, Reddit, 2024-08-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BambuLab/comments/1efexnk/rippling_on_first_layer_on_a1/lhue4xx/) (in reply to ID lfm154i):\nThis is your answer.

It happened with Prusament using the Prusament preset in Prusa Slicer, and again with Hatchbox PLA using the Hatchbox PLA preset.

After speaking with Prusa support multiple times and verifying lots of sensor values, it looks like the loadcel sensor is not returning expected values, which would certainly impact bed leveling and result in this type of issue.

It’s still doing it’s job. The board will start to leech ink from the comic eventually, though. Swap that out in 5-10 years (although I’ve had boards still be fine after 20 years). When you swap the boards, swap the bags too. Now, that being said, for this book in particular, I would follow the rest of the advice here and use Mylar. However, I don’t think that should be a default choice for most collections as it’s expensive. If you just collect keys, sure, that makes sense. If you’re a dollar bin guy collecting complete runs, mylites and halfbacks are just going to add up to a fortune on books most people won’t ever care about individually.\n\nAlso: great book!

Some of these I'd re-bag, and in another 6+ months, the bags would be rippled again. Interestingly, the vast majority of the comics were IDW series, primarily TMNT and GI JOE along with a few others. I've had many more IDW and Image and other indie books get rippled bags than Big Two books, especially in the short term.  All that said, my conclusion is that the bags are affected by some quality or aspect of the cover paper or the ink, or some part of the printing process that might be used or more heavily used, at least, by IDW for example but not Marvel and DC.\n\n## Comment ID jzq3wpp with +2 score by [(Comic_Books_Forever, Reddit, 2023-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookcollecting/comments/16d77a5/why_are_my_bags_rippling_like_this/jzq3wpp/) (in reply to ID 16d77a5):\nAll printed items off-gas because there is acidity involved.

Unless it really is the first appearance of Paul.\n\n## Comment ID jzoz2bq with +1 score by [(timetodance42, Reddit, 2023-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookcollecting/comments/16d77a5/why_are_my_bags_rippling_like_this/jzoz2bq/) (in reply to ID 16d77a5):\nSome bags will just do this, others will do it when they get old (which these may be old, just newly putchased) and sometimes this will happen if the books are stuffed in too tightly to one another.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID jzock4g with +1 score by [(i3onesaw, Reddit, 2023-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookcollecting/comments/16d77a5/why_are_my_bags_rippling_like_this/jzock4g/) (in reply to ID 16d77a5):\nAnyone have a recommendation for where to buy mylar bags and boards in bulk for a personal collection?

The head of the department, who previously worked at Meta, has exhibited concerning leadership practices, including firing direct reports with little to no warning, mishandling equity distribution in ways that have caused frustration among employees, and routinely withholding important information from his direct reports. This lack of transparency has set up his team for failure on several occasions, with employees later being blamed for outcomes that were beyond their control.\n\nHis inability to collaborate effectively with other leaders has also led to a significant reduction in his scope. This change came after a series of failed initiatives, during which he threw his team under the bus rather than accepting responsibility for poor outcomes.\n\nFurthermore, this leader’s behavior during company events has raised additional concerns. At several documented team happy hours, he has made inappropriate comments about other leaders while inebriated. These incidents have been observed by multiple employees, further calling into question his professionalism and judgment.\n\nWhile Rippling is doing well from a business standpoint, and there are many talented and friendly individual contributors (ICs) on the team, the leadership in the data science department creates an unnecessarily hostile and unstable environment. I would recommend exercising caution when considering a role under this leadership until meaningful changes are made.",

There is none. You'll continue to do more work, with no pay increase because you should be happy to be a part of such a fast paced and revolutionary company. \nBenefits - Not that good for a company that offers benefits. No stipend towards wellness, and what insurance covers still means you have to pay out of pocket even when you're working in-network. My therapy co-pay went up by $25 when I moved to their plans. \nWork Life Balance - Expect your boss to slack you after hours, and expect to reply. Expect to work when you're sick. Expect that you'll work weekends. The disregard for your personal time is horrendous. Oh, and that unlimited PTO? It's capped at 3 weeks. Don't expect more.",

On top of that, my leaders would see how stressed I was, and never asked how I was doing, the only thing was whats the next task or deal, never time to breathe.

I was over 110% quota for a 12-14 month period and those performing below me and those with less tenure got interviews and roles in segments higher than me. On top of that, they kept giving me more responsibilities on top of the hundreds of accounts I managed (300-600 accounts). Those responsibilities included training 3 new hires at the same time, helping those I was not assigned too because some managers wouldn’t help them, and even training people at the management level. Not once did I get a pay raise (only decreases), or even an interview for an up segment role even though I voiced my want for that and a pay raise my last 6+months there. Managing that many accounts also leaved almost no time to get work done but management is constantly hounding you to have everything up to date. When you have 7 sales calls a day and about 50 emails coming in every day its almost impossible. I was working from 8-8 almost every day, and only to be thanked by pay decrease, confusing quota changes that decreased pay, and not a single look or real conversation about my future.",

You are interacting with really smart people and teams on a day to day basis, and hence learning and growing.\n\nOpen and improved engineering culture: There aren't any boundaries on people to go and learn, major engineering projects are put in open for others to discuss and learn. The engineering team and culture has improved vastly in the last 2 years, with a lot of seasoned staff and senior staff engineers in the org.\n\nProduct and revenue growth: Rippling's clarity in what they want to build had been astonishing from day 1. Some of the products that we recently launched are things that comp any had in their plan from day 1. There is so much conviction and clarity into all the product and engineering investment that most of our products launched scale from 0 to few millions of revenue within their first year. The revenue growth has been astonishing, not derailed by many macro economic crisis. The revenue stream is diversified and proven to be resilient to so many external factors.",

Excuses are tools for incompetence. I’ve worked at start ups who already had such systems created early in the process and actually support their employees. How can you expect customers to have a good experience when you’re not even supporting the people who are client-facing at this company?

A lot of people who work here are kind and cool people but everyone is running around with their heads chopped off. -If you want to be so stressed out of your mind that you stop eating, lose your quality of life, then work here.

The reviews that state work life balance is awful are 100% true, and unfortunately, you will likely burn out before the company reaches their IPO anyway. This isn’t necessarily Ripplings fault entirely, it’s just that payroll, benefits, Hr is a grueling awful vertical to play in. You’ll quickly get tired of clients complaining about almost every aspect of the product. Trust me, it brings your life down so much that you’ll start questioning your career path. The executive team in this company needs to realize that sometimes building new SKU’s for the sake of new SKU’s is not going to sit well with your current client base. Current client enhancements can go often ignored… I expect a relatively high client churn rate for the next few years, before management gets the clue and maybe 180’s their strategy. They’ll need to do this before it’s too late and total ARR starts moving in the wrong direction. Product is struggling to scale to enterprise level/quality, but that’s a challenge at all SaaS companies. If you’re okay grinding and saying goodbye to your friends and family, then this may be an okay place for you. Otherwise, find a better SaaS vertical to play in.",

Instead, it has been incredibly refreshing as a member of the legal and compliance team to get a running head start on nearly all projects, so that we can pull together the right compliance infrastructure for our products, and be deeply embedded in our product initiatives, often dogfooding and testing what we've advised on and built. Our team has also gotten to be true advocates, fiercely defend our employees from aggressive competitor tactics, pulling together a first rate immigration program for our team, commanding one of the most efficient sales/commercial processes. In short, it is really fun (and rare) to help win as a business, while also doing it the right way and with flair. And we have fun :) \n\nRippling is also one of the most transparent places that I have worked in that, top down and bottoms up, people actually say what they are thinking and have discussions. While candor can take some getting used to (and for some, may seem like a con), it has meant that this has been the least political and bureaucratic place that I have ever worked. There's simply has been no room for politics (giving off appearance instead of reality) because people say whats on their mind, ask a lot of questions, and \"go and see\" what the truth/reality is.",

Currently, there is a pervasive sense of fear and disillusionment among employees, often surfacing within the first 1-3 months of their tenure.\n\nWhile the company offers a competitive base salary, the subpar benefits package is hindering our ability to attract and retain top talent. Other employers, even with a slightly lower base compensation, are luring prospective employees with superior benefits, including affordable health insurance for dependents, 401k matching, office amenities, wellness programs, and professional development stipends.\n\nRippling holds great potential to become a leading tech company, but urgent attention is needed to address the toxic burnout culture, enhance overall benefits, and stabilize product quality for sustained success.",

The overall vibe at Rippling is “you are lucky to work here, so you take what you’re given.” This has worked for them so far in the startup phase, but I see this crumbling in the near future. You can’t have the turnover this company has and execute a successful longterm strategy.\n-generally, middle managers are inexperienced and aren’t on your side\n-work-life balance is non-existent and in fact, the CEO has said in so many words that he doesn’t believe in it\n-there doesn’t seem to be an overall vision or strategy: for the product, for company initiatives, for any part of Rippling.

A lot of people who work here are kind and cool people but everyone is running around with their heads chopped off. -If you want to be so stressed out of your mind that you stop eating, lose your quality of life, then work here.

This isn’t necessarily Ripplings fault entirely, it’s just that payroll, benefits, Hr is a grueling awful vertical to play in. You’ll quickly get tired of clients complaining about almost every aspect of the product. Trust me, it brings your life down so much that you’ll start questioning your career path. The executive team in this company needs to realize that sometimes building new SKU’s for the sake of new SKU’s is not going to sit well with your current client base. Current client enhancements can go often ignored… I expect a relatively high client churn rate for the next few years, before management gets the clue and maybe 180’s their strategy. They’ll need to do this before it’s too late and total ARR starts moving in the wrong direction. Product is struggling to scale to enterprise level/quality, but that’s a challenge at all SaaS companies. If you’re okay grinding and saying goodbye to your friends and family, then this may be an okay place for you. Otherwise, find a better SaaS vertical to play in.",

Our team has also gotten to be true advocates, fiercely defend our employees from aggressive competitor tactics, pulling together a first rate immigration program for our team, commanding one of the most efficient sales/commercial processes. In short, it is really fun (and rare) to help win as a business, while also doing it the right way and with flair.

Rippling, however, finds itself in a middle ground where it continuously encounters new and evolving challenges. As a result, there is no end to impact if someone is up for it.",

My therapy co-pay went up by $25 when I moved to their plans. \nWork Life Balance - Expect your boss to slack you after hours, and expect to reply. Expect to work when you're sick.

      "# [What's new in Rippling — August '24 Release by The Rippling Team on 2024-08-23](https://www.rippling.com/blog/august-2024-product-updates)\nNew tools to help you find exactly what you need in Rippling\n\nNavigate Rippling faster with enhanced search\n\nNow, you can search across the entire system using Rippling’s new, improved search bar. Pull up employee profiles, open your favorite reports, and find candidate profiles with just a keystroke. With this upgrade, you can jump exactly where you want to go in Rippling without clicking into and navigating apps. Plus, you can access the search bar anywhere by simply hitting the ‘/’ key.\n\nSeamlessly move through Rippling with the upgraded mobile app\n\nIn the Rippling mobile app, the new navbar places search, home, and employee profile at the bottom of your screen—no matter where you go in the app—helping you navigate with ease.\n\nCreate custom folders in the Documents app\n\nNow, you have the ability to create custom folders and subfolders in the Documents app, so you can organize your documents any way you like.\n\nHire and pay employees in Denmark, New Zealand, and Switzerland\n\nRippling EOR lets you hire and pay employees abroad, without the hassle of setting up a local entity. Most recently, we’ve expanded EOR to Denmark, New Zealand, and Switzerland—with more countries on the way.\n\nGet a single view of your global tax credits balance\n\nTracking accumulated credits with multiple local tax agencies from pay run corrections is hard. That’s why Rippling now offers a consolidated view of your global credits balance to help manage what you’re owed and request refunds as needed.\n\nManage your global payroll with increased financial flexibility\n\nFunding your international pay runs just got easier. You’re now able to locally fund every pay run via bank transfers in 14 currencies: USD, CAD, GBP, EUR, AUD, HKD, JPY, NZD, SGD, CHF, SEK, DKK, NOK, and PLN.\n\nAdd additional employees to pre-existing off-cycle pay runs\n\nPreviously, you could not add additional employees after creating an off-cycle pay run. Now you can add employees to an off-cycle pay run without having to create a separate off-cycle pay run.\n\nDo more globally with country-specific enhancements\n\nWe’re always expanding the coverage of Rippling for your international teams. This month we launched:\n\n🇮🇳 Tax withholding for global contractor payments for Indian companies\n\n🇬🇧 Support for attachment of earnings orders for UK payroll\n\n🇫🇷 French Benefits Administration can import Fiche de paramétrage DSN\n\nNew expansions to employee benefits that’ll save you time\n\nGive employees with Flex and COBRA direct access to support\n\nNow, employees actively enrolled or in the process of enrolling in COBRA, or needing help with Flex Benefits claims, can contact Rippling Support directly. This helps your team save time, answering questions around claims or COBRA payments, solving transaction issues, and much more.\n\nBroaden your employees’ benefits options\n\nExpand your benefits portfolio without directly integrating with carriers, thanks to custom benefits. Rippling now offers support for a variety of new benefits and plan structures, giving your employees access to pet insurance, mental health services, fertility options, and more.\n\nNew features that make your candidate and employee data more useful & usable\n\nRecruiting: Discover top talent with our new candidate database\n\nSearch through a database of every candidate who has applied to your company using attributes like skills or previous experience. This helps you rediscover past prospects or build attribute-based campaigns to attract talent at scale. Plus, you can make each search as precise as you’d like by adding search logics like ‘AND’, and ‘OR’.\n\nReverse common mistakes when updating employee records\n\nPreviously, it was difficult to undo a change that was applied to an employee’s record. Now you can undo the most recently applied change and reapply the correct change if needed—ensuring you always have an accurate employee history.\n\nNew additions that give you flexibility and control over corporate spend\n\nBill Pay: Pay vendors faster with 2-day ACH\n\nBill Pay now supports 2-day ACH payments, giving you more flexibility to pay vendors faster, whenever you want.\n\nCorporate Cards: Get more control over card spend with transaction approvals\n\nYou can now automatically flag card transactions for approval, getting more oversight across card spend than ever before. This will help you stay compliant and request repayment if a transaction lands out of policy.\n\nReimburse employees outside of a pay run\n\nPreviously, employee expense reimbursements were always paid through payroll. Now, you can reimburse expenses to employees who aren’t on Rippling Payroll using direct deposit. This also allows companies to pay out reimbursements to more employees between pay runs.\n\nNew protections for your systems and devices\n\nStrengthen your security with passkeys\n\nRippling now supports passkeys, making it easier for employees to sign into their accounts with a more secure method than traditional passwords. Passkeys are phishing-resistant, protecting your company against the number one cause of data breaches while reducing support requests for resets and account lockouts.\n\nExplore our expanded Windows MDM software catalog\n\nWe’ve expanded our Windows MDM software catalog to include 100+ new titles. These allow you to make software updates for employees automatically from Rippling MDM. If you don't see your software of choice, you can easily request new titles to be added directly from the Rippling catalog.\n\nRippling + Gable: On-demand workspaces around the globe\n\nRippling is excited to announce a new integration with Gable, an all-in-one platform where remote and hybrid teams can access a network of vetted workspaces around the globe. With a one-click integration, you can now bring Rippling data into Gable to streamline account creation and removal, automatically set user roles and policies, access robust and comprehensive reporting, and more.\n\nStay tuned for what’s next\n\nWe’ll be back next month with our latest and greatest. If you’re curious about what we’re up to next, schedule time with us to get a sneak preview of our platform improvements.\n\nSee you next month!\n\nFollow us on LinkedIn",

      "# [Rippling Announces Series F Fundraising & Tender Offer by Parker Conrad on 2024-04-22](https://www.rippling.com/blog/rippling-announces-series-f-fundraising-and-tender-offer)\nWe’re pleased to announce Rippling has raised $200M in new financing, and signed agreements with investors to repurchase up to $590M of equity from current employees, former employees, and early investors. The financing was led by Coatue with participation from Founders Fund, Greenoaks, and other existing investors. Dragoneer is joining the round as a new investor.\n\nThe financing values the company at $13.5 billion.\n\nWe’re grateful for these investors’ conviction in Rippling, for the employees that have gotten us to this point, and for our clients, without whom none of this would be possible.\n\nRippling’s core thesis is that employee data is critical to a surprisingly large number of business systems, including the ones well outside of HR.\n\nMaintaining the fidelity of the same employee data across all these disconnected systems—effectively, across multiple separate databases—is the reason it’s a lot of work for companies to have many different business systems in the first place. Rippling solves this problem by giving companies and employees a single place to make changes, which then propagate everywhere automatically.\n\nThe system that does this isn’t just a time-saver—we believe it will be a critical primitive for business software going forward.\n\nProducts that are built on top of a rich graph of data about the organization, employees, their devices and apps aren’t just easier to manage. They are better as software products—with more intelligent workflows and approvals, better role-based policies and permissions, and more powerful analytics.\n\nThis system we’ve built helps companies run more efficiently and achieve their business goals faster than their competitors. We will continue to expand in new markets and invest deeply in R&D to enhance our current offering and build new products to support our clients.\n\nTo better understand Rippling’s approach and where we’re headed, you can read a lightly redacted version of the memo I wrote for investors ahead of this financing.",

The deal, a Series F investment, also saw the participation of several other institutional backers including Greenoaks, which led Rippling’s previous $500 million round last March. The software maker’s total outside funding now stands at about $1.4 billion.\n\nIn conjunction with the new financing round, Rippling announced a secondary sale worth up to $590 million. The transaction will allow current and former employees, as well as early investors, to sell some of their equity.\n\nRippling’s flagship offering is a cloud platform designed to help human resources teams carry out their work more efficiently. The platform’s feature set covers payroll administration, employee onboarding and other day-to-day HR tasks. A built-in automation tool allows users to create workflows that can perform repetitive chores without manual input.\n\nAlongside its core HR platform, Rippling offers two other software-as-a-service products. The first targets accounting departments, while the other is geared towards information technology professionals.\n\nRippling’s accounting platform is designed to streamline tasks such as planning budgets and issuing corporate credit cards. Its service for IT teams, in turn, reduces the amount of work required to set up employee devices. The latter offering also lends itself to several related use cases including application access management and compromised device detection.\n\n“Rippling’s core thesis is that employee data is critical to a surprisingly large number of business systems, including the ones well outside of HR,” Chief Executive Officer Parker Conrad wrote in a blog post today. “Products that are built on top of a rich graph of data about the organization, employees, their devices and apps aren’t just easier to manage. They are better as software products.”\n\nRippling disclosed after its previous funding round last March that it was generating more than $100 million in annual recurring revenue. Last month, the Information reported that this number has since jumped to over $350 million. It’s believed the company’s expansion beyond HR software to the IT and accounting segments is one of the contributors to this growth.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, Rippling will use its latest funding round to bolster its product portfolio with a fourth cloud service. Conrad told the publication that the offering will target a “completely different area” without elaborating. He added that Rippling plans to equip its software with more artificial intelligence features.\n\nImage: Rippling",

      "# [Rippling’s Parker Conrad on the company's new round, new SF lease and, also, its newest critic by Connie Loizos on 2024-04-22](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/ripplings-parker-conrad-on-the-companys-brand-new-round-its-brand-new-sf-lease-and-also-its-brand-new-critic/)\nLast week, TechCrunch broke the news that the workforce management software outfit Rippling was on the cusp of closing a new, $200 million round of funding at a hefty $13.4 billion valuation led by Coatue. We also reported that the round featured a separate, $670 million secondary component meant to give some of the company’s investors a bigger bite of the company, while letting Rippling’s employees — some of whom joined at the outset in 2016 — cash out some of their shares.\n\nRippling declined to comment at the time, but in an interview Friday afternoon, founder Parker Conrad confirmed our information, adding that the secondary component is actually a $590 million tender, with $200 million available for employees and $390 million available for seed and other investors.\n\nThe round, Rippling’s Series F, is also almost entirely an inside round. Coatue is an earlier investor in Rippling, along with other backers in this round that have been investing all along, including Founders Fund and Greenoaks. The only new member on the cap table is Dragoneer, a growth-stage investment firm in San Francisco.\n\nOf course, we were interested in much more than Rippling’s new fundraise, so while we had Conrad on the phone, we talked turnover. We discussed the company’s new office lease in San Francisco (right now, it’s the second-biggest lease to be signed this year in the city). Conrad also shared why Rippling is relatively “free” of AI. You can hear that full conversation in podcast form; if you prefer to read it, excerpts of that conversation follow, edited for length.\n\nSo why raise this money?\n\nHonestly, it started out as just an employee tender. We wanted to find a way to get some liquidity for early employees, so we went to market, looking really to do about $200 million for employees that wanted to sell some stock. [But] we got a lot of investor interest, so we expanded it first to include a small amount of primary [capital] — mostly as a way to get more ownership for investors that were looking to buy more — and then beyond that, we ended up expanding into seed investors as well.\n\nWhat does this secondary sale say about your plans to eventually go public? An IPO is a little bit in the distance?\n\nI definitely think it’s a bit in the distance, but it’s not like a way of delaying [anything]. If anything, it’s probably nice if there are people who want to buy a house or [want more cash] because life happens. It’s great to relieve some of that pressure before you go public so that you don’t have tons of people selling as soon as they can in the public markets.\n\nIs this the first time employees have been able to sell some shares?\n\nIt’s not. We did something in 2021. But it was smaller and the company was smaller, and it was a long time ago.\n\nDo you worry about employees leaving after cashing out?\n\nOne of the things that we talked about internally when we launched it was, we said, ‘Look, the first rule of an employee tender is that you don’t talk about the tender internally or publicly.’ We don’t want to see anyone spiking the football, or something like that. And the second rule of the employee tender is, ‘see the first rule.’ This is a very private, personal thing, and I’m thrilled for everyone [participating]; if this makes a difference in [their] life, that’s great. But it’s not the destination. The game’s not over.\n\nHow do you feel about turnover more generally? Some people don’t like to see it; other managers think it’s for the best. Elon Musk seems to be a fan, given the rate at which he turns over his executive team at Tesla.\n\nThe executive team at Rippling has been remarkably stable for a long time. A lot of the people on the team are people who I originally hired for those roles. Some of them are people I have long work histories with, even before this company. And certainly I always like to keep people. I mean, every once in a while, there’s an early Rippling employee who leaves the company, and I find it always just emotionally really sad when that happens, even if the company is going to be fine and they want to do something else or, you know, in some cases just kind of hang out. On a personal level, that’s always very difficult for me.\n\nYou newly leased 123,000 square feet in San Francisco for local employees, who are now back three days a week. How did you settle on that policy, and do you worry about retention or hiring?\n\nWe just think there’s an enormous amount of value of people being in the office together. We were never a company that was going remote. When we went remote temporarily during the pandemic, we said, this is for three weeks, and then we’re going back to the office. Of course, it was unfortunately a lot longer than that, but we were back in the office as soon as we could be. I think it’s possible for some companies to be fully remote, but it’s sort of like playing the game on hard mode. I think it’s a lot easier if people can get together in person; you get a lot done.\n\nIn the meantime, workforce management software is super crowded. You’re going up against a company that you famously co-founded and ran, Zenefits. There’s Paycor, Workday, Gusto, to name a few . . .\n\nThe weird thing is that Rippling is not actually a [human capital management] HCM company. Everyone who has been building business software believes that the way to build the best business software is to build these extremely narrow, focused deep products. And I think it’s completely wrong. I think the way you build the best business software is to build a really broad product suite of deeply integrated and seamlessly interoperable products. Yes, we have a very strong HR and payroll suite, but we also have an IT and security suite; we have a spend management suite, where we do things like corporate cards and bill pay and expense reimbursements. Actually, we’re using the primary capital that we raised in this round to fund the R&D efforts for a new, fourth cloud that we intend to launch in a completely different area.\n\nThe classic example of a company that builds software in this way is Microsoft. Microsoft is like the OG of compound software businesses.\n\nSpeaking of Microsoft, what is your “AI strategy”?\n\nWe are a company that is relatively free of any AI products right now. There’s some stuff that we’re working on. But I am always very skeptical of things that are, like, super trendy in Silicon Valley. So I can tell you what [our AI strategy] is not. I’m super skeptical of these chatbots. I don’t think anyone wants to chat with their HR software.\n\nI have to ask about a tweet related to our story about your new round. I saw [Benchmark general partner] Bill Gurley chimed in that “Anti-focus ain’t cheap.” I wasn’t sure if that was laudatory or a dig. Do you know?\n\nI assume given that it came from Bill that it’s a dig. And he’s not wrong that taking this opposite approach is expensive, particularly on the R&D side. If you look at Rippling financially, the thing that really stands out is how we spend on R&D. If you compare us to other HCM competitors — because you talked about the crowded HCM space — they spend an average of 10% of their revenue on R&D. Next year, Rippling is going to spend as much on R&D as [three rival companies] combined, and we have a much lower revenue footprint than the three. It’s definitely true that there’s a huge upfront investment phase in building what we’re building that obviously over time, as a percent of revenue, should come down. So he’s not wrong, but it’s a very explicit part of our strategy. What Bill might not totally understand is the benefit that you get from building software in this way; much higher upfront R&D costs [later result in] much higher sales and marketing efficiency.\n\nHas Bill ever done business with you?\n\nNo, I’ve never met Bill. He’s sort of a constant, low-grade antagonist, but I’ve never actually met him.\n\nI know he doesn’t get along very well with Marc Andreessen.\n\nThen Bill and I have that in common. Maybe we should meet up and grab a beer over that particular thing.",

The company, which will occupy 69,000 square feet on the 59th and 60th floors of 4 World Trade Center, is expanding its operations to harness New York City's exceptional workforce talent and benefit from its leadership in the tech and innovation economy, fueling further growth through substantial investments in research and development. Rippling’s expansion in New York City builds on Governor Hochul’s commitment to attracting innovative businesses to New York State, building a 21st century economy, and creating good jobs for New Yorkers.\n\n\"New York is investing in innovative businesses like Rippling that are driving growth in new industries, creating good jobs for New Yorkers, and securing the economic future for our state,” Governor Hochul said. “Rippling’s commitment to tripling its footprint here and investing millions over the next decade to support research and development is proof that our efforts are working, and my administration will continue to support the industry leaders whose breakthrough technologies in AI and other sectors will move our economy forward.”\n\nRippling has committed to creating at least 390 new jobs across its marketing, finance, legal, sales, operations, and engineering teams while retaining 173 full-time employees, supported by up to $3.5 million in performance-based Excelsior Jobs Program tax credits from Empire State Development. The expansion also enables Rippling to invest more than $29 million in research and development spending in New York State over 10 years to build new products and advance its market-leading Spend Management platform, which helps companies manage expenses more efficiently.\n\nEmpire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight said, \"Investing in high-growth companies like Rippling strengthens New York's reputation as a global tech hub, sparking innovation and creating good-paying jobs. ESD is thrilled to support Rippling's expansion as part of our ongoing efforts to cultivate a thriving 21st-century economic landscape. By nurturing tomorrow's industries today, we are unlocking promising futures and fueling inclusive prosperity for all New Yorkers.\"\n\nRippling Co-Founder and CEO Parker Conrad said, \"Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance, bringing together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. By consolidating all of a company's employee data and tools into one system, Rippling enables our clients to achieve their goals faster and more efficiently​. We're grateful for Governor Hochul's leadership ​as we grow the team ​to support our expanding business. 4 World Trade Center is the ideal location as we expand our footprint in New York City.\"\n\nTech:NYC President & CEO Julie Samuels said, “Rippling’s expansion and hiring plans confirm what tens of thousands of other tech companies know: New York City is one of the most attractive places in the world to build and grow a tech company. The tech sector remains committed to powering the region’s economy, and we’re thrilled that leading innovators like Rippling are choosing New York to create jobs, source top talent, and further bolster the city’s position as a global hub for innovation.”\n\nFounded in 2016, Rippling streamlines human resources, information technology, and finance on a unified platform tailored for businesses with 2-2000+ employees, including through the use of artificial intelligence. Rippling consolidates employee management into a single system by centralizing payroll, benefits, device management, and more. This consolidation enables seamless, swift onboarding—allowing companies to configure payroll, corporate cards, devices, and apps for new hires in minutes. With its New York City expansion set to accommodate hundreds of additional hires, Rippling will leverage the larger footprint to keep pace with rapidly accelerating demand while cultivating an in-person work environment.\n\nThe company’s expansion in New York complements Governor Hochul’s State of the State proposal to secure New York’s place at the forefront of the artificial intelligence transformation. The Governor announced the creation of Empire AI, a consortium that will create and launch a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence computing center in Upstate New York to be used by New York’s leading institutions to promote responsible research and development, create jobs, and unlock AI opportunities focused on public good.\n\nIt also represents one of several cutting-edge companies contributing to the acceleration of New York City’s innovation economy under Governor Hochul. With New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Governor Hochul announced progress on SPARC Kips Bay, a first-of-its-kind life sciences career and education hub that will anchor the industry in New York; opened the $700 million state-of-the-art TaysteeLab Building and $9 million expansion of Harlem Biospace in West Harlem; announced Schrödinger, Inc’s $7.6 million expansion in Times Square; the $3 million expansion of communications company MetTel, and the selection of New York City as the future home of the $300 million Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Biohub.",

This all takes time. And costs money.\n\nThe good news is that if you're an independent contractor, sole proprietor, or another form of self-employed worker, many of your business expenses are tax-deductible.\n\nThese deductions, also known as write-offs, are subtracted from your taxable income, which lowers your tax bill. While a deduction won't provide a dollar-for-dollar refund for an expense, it’ll likely lessen the amount you owe to the IRS.\n\nIt pays for self-employed workers in the US to know what is and isn't tax-deductible. While you should consult a certified public accountant (CPA), attorney, or another tax professional to get a comprehensive view of which expenses qualify, consider this your starter guide, complete with common self-employed tax deductions to keep in mind and strategies for recording them.\n\n16 independent contractor tax deductions\n\nBelow, you'll find some of the most common 1099 tax deductions for self-employed workers, along with where to claim the expenses on your tax forms. This list is not exhaustive, and the exact provisions are constantly changing, so you should consult tax professionals and check the IRS' Self-Employed Individuals Tax Center for more information.\n\n1. Self-employment tax deduction\n\nContractors can deduct half of the self-employment tax from their net income. Since you're your own boss when you're self-employed, the IRS allows you to treat this tax as a business expense.\n\nPaperwork: Fill out a Schedule SE, then record half of the tax determined on Line 15 of your Schedule 1.\n\n2. Home office deduction\n\nIf you work from home, you can deduct some of your housing costs from your taxes. This includes:\n\nRent\n\nMortgage interest\n\nHome depreciation\n\nUtilities\n\nHomeowners insurance\n\nMaintenance and repairs\n\nSuppose you rent (rather than own) your home office space and quality for the home office deduction. In that case, you can deduct a percentage of your monthly rent equal to the percentage of your home’s square footage regularly and exclusively used for work. If your home office takes up 15% of your home, you can also deduct 15% of your annual utilities, like electricity.\n\nAdditional office-related expenses you can deduct include office supplies and furniture. If you maintain an office outside your home, incidental maintenance costs and a portion of utilities may also be tax deductible.\n\nPaperwork: The standard way to deduct your home office expenses is by filling out IRS Form 8829. Additionally, you can record home office expenses on Line 30 of your Schedule C. Record deductions for additional office-related expenses between lines 18 and 27 on your Schedule C.\n\n3. Cell phone and internet bills\n\nYou can write off the parts of your phone and internet expenses you use for your business. For example, you can write off any extra costs of long-distance business calls. You can also deduct the entire cost of a second phone line so long as it's exclusively dedicated to your business.\n\nWriting off internet use is similar. You can deduct costs associated with hosting a business website but not bills for personal internet use. Once you delineate which portions of your phone and internet bills are for business and which are personal, you can fully deduct the former.\n\nPaperwork: Business-related cell phone expenses go in Part V of your Schedule C. Internet expenses go in the utilities section on Line 25.\n\n4. Insurance\n\nHealth insurance. You can deduct your health, dental, and long-term care premiums so long as you're not qualified for a plan through your spouse's employer. If you have a spouse, children, or dependents age 26 or younger, you can also deduct health insurance premiums you paid on their behalf.\n\nBusiness insurance. You can deduct premiums for fire insurance, credit insurance, business liability insurance, and car insurance (if the vehicle is used for business).\n\nPaperwork: Health insurance costs go on Line 17 of your Schedule 1, and business insurance costs go on Line 15 of your Schedule C.\n\n5. Travel expenses\n\nYou can deduct travel-related expenses from your taxes if you have a specific, business-related purpose for your trip, which has to be outside of the general area of your home. This includes costs of:\n\nPlane, train, or bus tickets\n\nTaxis and rideshares during your trip\n\nBaggage fees (including shipping)\n\nCar expenses on your trip, including rentals, tolls, and parking fees\n\nLodging\n\nWhile you don't always have to pick the cheapest travel options, you should stay away from writing off any lavish expenses (e.g., booking a first-class flight) for your business trip.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 24.\n\n6. Advertising\n\nAny cost you put up to advertise your business is tax-deductible. This includes:\n\nOnline ads (like Facebook or Google)\n\nTV commercials\n\nRadio spots\n\nMail fliers\n\nBillboards\n\nThis also includes deducting fees from any PR or advertising agencies. You can also write off ads that encourage charitable giving that have your company's name on them.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 8.\n\n7. Meals\n\nYou can also write off half the cost of any meals from business-related travel. Other eligible meals include:\n\nLunch or dinner with clients\n\nFood from a business conference\n\nCatering for promotional events\n\nYou can deduct 50% of the actual cost of the meal with a receipt or take the standard meal allowance—which is pegged to the per diem for federal workers.\n\nPaperwork: Record your meals under travel expenses on Line 24 of your Schedule C.\n\n8. Vehicle expenses\n\nIndependent contractors can claim tax deductions for car expenses when they use the vehicle for business-related reasons, like driving to meet a new client or attending a seminar. Commuting to and from work is never tax-deductible.\n\nThe IRS sets a new standard mileage rate every year that you can record to figure out your deduction. In 2024, the rate is $0.67 cents per mile.\n\nWhile it's slightly more complicated, you can also figure out the percentage portion of business-related driving you did in the past year and multiply it by your car's operating expenses. For example, if you spend $4,000 on maintaining a car you used for work 20% of the time, you could write off $800. That said, there are significant record-keeping requirements for this deduction that you can learn more about here.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 9.\n\n9. Interest expenses\n\nYou can also write off any interest incurred from business loans, like business credit cards, equipment loans, and business lines of credit. If you take out a loan for business and personal reasons, you're only eligible for a deduction for the business portion. So keep careful track of where those funds are going.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that these deductions won't pay off all of your business-related interest. It's always better to pay debts off in full yourself as soon as you can instead of relying on write-offs.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 16.\n\n10. Dues and publications\n\nSelf-employed contractors can also deduct costs from trade magazines and journals directly related to their business—e.g., Graphic Arts Monthly if you're a web designer.\n\nYou can also deduct fees for belonging to groups related to your business, so long as they're not recreational (e.g., no country clubs). According to the IRS, these can include:\n\nBusiness leagues\n\nChambers of commerce\n\nCivic or public service organizations\n\nProfessional organizations (such as bar associations and medical associations)\n\nReal estate boards\n\nTrade associations\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Part V.\n\n11. Education expenses\n\nAny education related to your field of business is tax-deductible. You can claim credit on tuition expenses and get comped for webinars, online courses, and textbooks. But you can't write off any education expenses if you're pursuing a new career path separate from your current line of work.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Part V.\n\n12. Retirement plan contributions\n\nIf you're a self-employed small business owner, contributions to certain employee retirement accounts are tax-deductible. These include:\n\n401(k)s\n\nSimplified employee pension individual retirement accounts (SEP-IRAs)\n\nSavings incentive match plan for employees (SIMPLE) IRAs\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 19.\n\n13. Business licenses and taxes\n\nIf your business requires any special certifications (a real estate license, for instance), you can write off any associated fees on your tax return. The same goes for any regulatory taxes specific to your business.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 23.\n\n14. Business startup costs\n\nIn your first year of a new business, you can claim up to $5,000 in startup cost tax deductions from your taxes. This can apply to things like market research, location scouting, and attorney fees. You can also write off filing fees associated with setting up an LLC.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Part V.\n\n15. Equipment depreciation\n\nYou can deduct the cost of the wear and tear of your work tools as they age. The IRS requires that the eligible property be:\n\nSomething you own\n\nUsed for your business\n\nGoing to become obsolete\n\nExpected to last more than a year\n\nThe easiest way to calculate depreciation is by subtracting the equipment's expected value at the end of its life from its original cost while also determining how long you plan to use the equipment. There are other methods, and if you don't have expert accounting chops, you may want to seek the help of a professional.\n\nPaperwork: Line 13 of your Schedule C.\n\n16. Legal, accounting, and tax services\n\nTo keep track of all potential tax deductions from your business (and avoid any of the pitfalls), you should strongly consider soliciting help from CPAs, attorneys, or other tax professionals. These expenses are also tax-deductible.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 17.\n\n4 Tips for self-employed tax deductions\n\nThere are scores of tax write-offs that independent contractors and other self-employed workers can take advantage of. But if not done correctly, you run the risk of an IRS audit. So, before you make any big spending decisions banking on a tax deduction, here are some important guidelines to bear in mind.\n\nSeparate business and personal\n\nThe best way to improve your bookkeeping: clearly delineating business expenses from personal ones. Those lines are often blurred when you're self-employed.\n\nTax deductions are only for business expenses. You can't write off the cost of your bed because you messaged a client from it. The more you draw a clear line, the easier time you'll have claiming deductions. A simple way to do this is to have credit cards and bank accounts that are solely for your business.\n\nKeep great records\n\nProper bookkeeping makes deductions infinitely easier to claim come tax day—it's also your first line of defense in case of an audit. This means keeping and organizing receipts for anything you consider to be a business expense required to perform your line of work.\n\nSome deductions benefit from even more detailed record-keeping. For instance, if you're driving for business, you should record the date, mileage, and purpose of every trip. If you work out of a home office, you should have the dimensions of the workspace to calculate how much you write off.\n\n\"Is this an ordinary and necessary business expense?\"\n\nThis is the question you should always ask yourself before expecting a tax write-off—if the answer is yes, you can often claim a deduction. There are exceptions, such as capital expenses and the cost of goods sold. If the answer is no, the expense is likely non-deductible.\n\nAccording to the IRS: \"An ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in your industry. A necessary expense is one that is helpful and appropriate for your trade or business.\"\n\nThis means you shouldn't deduct any expenses outside your line of work. It also means that while you don't have to pick the cheapest possible options to claim a deduction (a motel stay on a business trip), you shouldn't pick any luxurious options (a five-star resort) either, as these will draw IRS scrutiny.\n\nPaperwork and deadlines\n\nIf you've made over $600 from a client, they'll send you a Form 1099-NEC by the end of January. This form will help you establish your gross income.\n\nSelf-employed workers use their own equipment, find their own office space, and make their own retirement contributions. It all takes time. And costs money.\n\nThe good news is that if you're an independent contractor, sole proprietor, or another form of self-employed worker, many of your business expenses are tax-deductible.\n\nThese deductions, also known as write-offs, are subtracted from your taxable income, which lowers your tax bill. While a deduction won't provide a dollar-for-dollar refund for an expense, it’ll likely lessen the amount you owe to the IRS.\n\nIt pays for self-employed workers in the US to know what is and isn't tax-deductible. While you should consult a certified public accountant (CPA), attorney, or another tax professional to get a comprehensive view of which expenses qualify, consider this your starter guide, complete with common write-offs to keep in mind and strategies for recording them.\n\nThe best way to send tax documents (and payments) to contractors\n\nContractors already face uphill battles filing their own quarterly taxes and documenting their own expenses for write-offs. The task is even trickier when clients are slow to send out 1099s and other forms that help them determine their taxable income.",
      "# [Rippling Launches Performance Management by People Center Inc. dba Rippling on 2024-05-08](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/05/08/2877869/0/en/Rippling-Launches-Performance-Management.html)\nSAN FRANCISCO, May 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rippling, the leading unified workforce management platform, today launched Performance Management. With Performance Management, Rippling customers can run global performance review cycles with 360º feedback, calibrate ratings confidentially, and run compensation processes including bonus payments. They can set up merit matrices and push changes directly to payroll. Rippling also supports year-round performance with triggered milestone reviews, goal setting, and soon, 1:1s.\n\nUnlike point solutions or legacy all-in-one systems, Performance Management is customizable to the business’s needs. And since all Rippling apps are natively built on top of the unified platform, clients can seamlessly connect performance data with other Rippling applications like Recruiting and Payroll as well as past cycle feedback and historical changes. As a result, reviews are always based on up-to-date employee attributes and can even be triggered at specific moments in the individual employee's lifecycle– all while ensuring complete control over who has access to performance data.\n\n“For HR leaders, unlocking employee talent is a top priority. But too often, they’re forced to design the performance management process around rigid, disconnected systems, rather than around the culture and the business’s needs,” said Darcy Mackay, Rippling’s SVP of HR and Client Services. “We want companies to stop managing spreadsheets and spend more time developing their people. Our Performance Management solution does just that.”\n\n“By removing the worry and arduousness of traditional review cycles, Rippling has helped us turn our performance management process into a strategic asset. We’re able to easily run an equitable, thorough, ongoing performance process for our team members and we’re already seeing the impact on our business,” said Laura Downey, LightForce’s HR Manager.\n\nRippling’s new Performance Management solution addresses the most common performance management pain points:\n\nAligning Employee Performance with Business Goals\n\nShared organizational goals are usually stored in a different system or locked in static documents, making it time-consuming to set and track an individual’s objectives and their progress against them. With Rippling, managers can quickly create goals, cascade them through their reporting line, and allocate ownership to specific members of their team. Likewise, instead of logging into a separate system, employees can review their goals regularly, using a system they’re in every day. And, because the Performance Management product connects to Rippling’s Employee Graph, business leaders can report on goal outcomes and trends alongside any other data in Rippling—including department, tenure, level and engagement surveys.\n\nLaunching Review Cycles\n\nTraditionally, launching a review cycle takes hours of manual work, especially if any customization is required. Because Rippling already understands a company’s roles and reporting structures, set-up is simplified and customization is painless. For example, you can create a full 360º review with upward, downward, and peer reviews. Within that cycle, you can decide how many peer reviews you want for each employee, specify unique questions for each department or reviewer, and even set rules about who should do the review if an employee transitioned managers during the review period.\n\nManaging Calibrations\n\nEnsuring reviews are consistent and fair usually requires hours of meetings and a plethora of spreadsheets– both in an effort to make sure no manager can view sensitive reviews and ratings information outside their scope. Because Rippling is built around one central source of truth for your organization, the system already knows which managers and HR business partners should have access to which employees’ information. It automatically handles all permissions, allowing appropriate managers and HR to compare and calibrate ratings directly in the app in either tabular or graphical format without having to use a single spreadsheet, eliminating the risk of confidential information falling into the wrong hands.\n\nStreamlining Compensation & Rewards\n\nAfter a typical review cycle, companies struggle not only with defining rewards schedules but also with sticking to their overall budget. Once compensation decisions are made, propagating those changes to a payroll system in an error-free manner is, at best, difficult and at worst, not even possible. This process often takes significant time after a review cycle, requiring endless spreadsheets and analysts to complete, resulting in review processes that can take many months to complete.\n\nRippling streamlines this entire process with built-in, customizable merit matrices, a real-time multi-currency view of a company’s overall rewards budget and dynamic policies that ensure an equitable process to help retain talent. This means any merit or level changes reflect automatically across the system, including payroll.\n\nConnecting Everything Together\n\nThe problem of disconnected systems is widespread. More than half of HR teams use seven or more point solutions. Legacy all-in-one systems, on the other hand, may share a common interface, but they lack configurability, preventing HR teams from tailoring review cycles to meet their particular organization’s needs. Often, privacy and data protection concerns are to blame for the fragmentation. But with Rippling’s Employee Graph at the core of every one of its products, including Performance Management, permissioning is already built in.\n\nAbout Rippling\n\nRippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance—globally. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, identity & access management, and device management. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.\n\nBased in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1.4B from the world's top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, and Bedrock.\n\nFor more information, visit Rippling.com.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nKristina Leal\n\nFirebrand Communications for Rippling\n\n415.848.9175\n\nrippling@firebrand.marketing",

      "# [Rippling launches in the United Kingdom by The Rippling Team on 2024-03-18](https://www.rippling.com/blog/rippling-launch-uk)\nRippling is now available for companies headquartered in the United Kingdom! As the first truly all-in-one workforce platform with built-in payroll, HRIS, benefits and more, Rippling offers access to over a dozen products that support your UK and global employees.\n\nThe problem with payroll and HR in the UK today\n\nToday, most businesses in the UK utilise a variety of disconnected systems and outsource payroll. They send emails, spreadsheets and bankfiles back and forth with their payroll provider (and their accountant, if they have one). Since these payroll services aren’t connected to an HR system, those same businesses have to manually update any changes to their employees’ data, like salaries, leave and deductions. If they don’t make these updates in time, those items aren’t reconciled until the following pay period. By the time funds hit your employees’ bank account, it’s often 10-15 days later than when you started. Needless to say, this process is rigid, error-prone and incredibly slow. And if you’re the one managing it, it’s stressful, too.\n\nOutsourcing payroll and HR also limits your reporting. Your workforce data lives outside of your company, fragmented across multiple systems, so you can’t just run a report. Instead, you’re forced to make requests and manually piece together data to understand your own business.\n\nPayroll is one example. But these limitations drag down every employee system in UK businesses.\n\nWith technology advancing in so many other fields, how has payroll and HR stayed untouched?\n\nFor starters, there is no all-in-one system in the UK with HR, payroll, benefits, and all the other tools you need to manage your employees. As a result, businesses like yours are forced to use spreadsheet uploads or simple integrations.\n\nOn top of that, no payroll provider in the UK has automated the movement of funds from their system to your bank to pay your employees.\n\nThis means the current payroll process includes multiple parties tackling a laborious series of steps, like data entry, manual calculations and file transfers.\n\nBut there’s good news: something better has arrived.\n\nIntroducing the UK’s first automated payroll system that runs itself\n\nRippling Payroll is deeply integrated with everything that touches payroll, including time tracking, benefits, pension and leave. That means all of your employee data, like salary increases, new starters, hours, deductions, leave and more automatically sync with payroll for a completely seamless experience.\n\nWhen it’s time to run payroll, you can review all of your payroll inputs in a matter of minutes, then click “Run payroll”. Rippling automatically calculates your taxes, pays your employees, and sends taxes to HMRC.\n\nIn other words, you don’t need to spend days trying to run payroll yourself. You just review and approve, and Rippling runs it for you.\n\nHRIS: Rippling’s HRIS is the source of truth for all of your employee data. By bringing all of your employee data together, you can manage and automate every step of the employee lifecycle, from onboarding to transitions to offboarding. Employees can self-serve, too. You no longer need to punch in sensitive employee data during onboarding, update their bank account details when they change, or manage their leave requests and balances manually out of spreadsheets or separate systems.\n\nReporting: When you manage your entire workforce in one system with Rippling, reporting becomes a breeze. You no longer have to export data from a dozen systems into Excel to get the answers you need. With Rippling, you can report on every piece of employee data – salary, equity, expenses, survey results and thousands of other data points – in a single system. If you have global employees, Rippling even converts currencies inside of reports – no manual number-crunching.\n\nBenefits administration: Rippling makes it easy for your new hires to enroll in benefits, like private medical coverage in the UK. We partner with top local brokers to bring you directly to the source. Already have a preferred broker? No problem. They can also integrate your plans into Rippling Benefits Administration so you can manage deductions, employee changes and open enrollment – all in one simple, online experience.\n\nTime tracking: Rippling Time & Attendance syncs seamlessly with Rippling Payroll, so you never have to track or enter hours outside of your HRIS.\n\nPolicy management: Rippling empowers you to design policies that can be applied company-wide or to groups of employees in specific locations. For example, you can design a global annual leave policy that gives all employees five weeks of paid holiday and an additional day per year of tenure.\n\nCompliance: We’ve built compliance rules into every product throughout Rippling to help you protect your business. For example, we’ll prevent you from hiring a 23-year-old employee for less than £10.42 per hour, so you don’t run afoul of the UK’s minimum wage law. We’ll also flag if you’ve added an employee to a non-compliant sick leave policy and provide guidance on how to fix that policy.\n\nExpense reimbursements: Rippling lets you build reimbursement policies based on employee data. As a result, it can automatically approve, block and flag expenses faster than other systems. You can also drill down into reimbursement requests directly in payroll. This lets you quickly answer the question of why somebody spent £500, without having to personally put them on the spot.\n\nAnd if you have a global team, you can use Rippling to manage them, too. Everything in Rippling – from onboarding and offboarding to compliance rules and policies – is automatically localised based on each employee’s location. That means you’ll never have to use siloed HR systems again.\n\nWith this launch, we’ve come one step closer to our goal of freeing smart people to work on hard problems. We can’t wait for UK businesses like yours to experience the power of Rippling.",
