App updates multiple times a week with no difference in performance. Freezes every clock in/clock out. Any positive reviews on here seem fake. As you can tell, Rippling doesn't respond to any reviews, just like they won't respond to any issues you have. Can't see paystub until payday. Worst payroll app I've ever used.",

      "# Post ID vcfyu7: I chose Rippling and highly regret it with +252 score by [(Rlvantage, Reddit, 2022-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/)\nThis is actually my first post here, but you guys are an amazing, helpful community and I wanted to share my experience so others are aware of how r/Rippling operates. I did my research before choosing Rippling, but apparently not enough. I went over my contract in depth before signing with Rippling, but apparently not good enough. Hopefully by reading my cautionary tale, I can prevent someone from making the same mistake. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nWe started with Rippling in March, and at first everything was going great. They actually have a really good setup to streamline the HR side of things with small businesses, and have some good extra technology features (for a cost) that I have not seen similar companies offer. We had 9 employees to start, and were told that Rippling charges per employee per month. So if at any time we hired more employees, we would obviously pay more that month for the additonal employees, which we were fine with. After several Zoom sessions with our Account Executive, we signed a 15mos contract.\n\nSince March we have gained and lost employees (due to us re-structuring the company), leaving our current total number of employees at 15. Well this month we were charged $800 more than what our usual bill is. When we reached out because we were obviously confused, we were told the higher charge was because Rippling is charging us for the number of employees we have, which is 25. We quickly said no that is not correct, we only have 15 employees. To which the response from Rippling was, \"well you once had 25 employees, so you need to continue to pay for 25 employees even if you don't have 25 employees\". \n\nWell seeing how Rippling is now telling us we have to pay an extra $800 per month for employees we do not have, and do not plan on getting for the next 12 Months, we wanted to find out if there was a way to possibly just reduce our head count back to 9. We figured we could just go back to Gusto with the rest of our employees, as they were always great and upfront about fees and cost. \n\nWhen we inquired about reducing our head count back to the original number, as we are a small business and cannot afford that extra cost per month, we were told that the  only way possible to do that is if we sign a 2-3 years additional contract with Rippling. We also were told that if we wanted to keep the employee count at 15, and just pay for the current number of employees we have, we would have to sign an additional 2-3 year contract to do so. \n\nSo apparently we are either stuck figuring out how to pay them an additional $800 per month for the next year, or stuck dealing with them for an additional 2-3 years no matter what happens with our business. \n\nI feel like Rippling is preying on my business and I don't know what to do. You can't speak to anyone by phone, only by email. What sucks about that is the person we've been communicating with only replies once every 24 hours, and just reiterates the same thing over and over again. I've asked legitimate questions as to why this is happening, and never get a direct answer. Worst part is the person I'm speaking to is an Account Executive with the company, so he is definitely trying to push us hard to sign this extended 2-3 year contract, even though we've only been with the company for 3 months. \n\nPlease don't make the mistake we did!\n\n\nTL;DR - Rippling baited and switched on us after being with them for 3 months. Payment for using their services went up over $800 per month unexpectedly on our 3rd month of using them. Rippling stated this is due to us having 25 employees at one point (started with 9, currently at 15), and that for the next 12 months our company will be charged for 25 employees whether we have them or not. The only way for us to be charged for the correct number of employees we have is to sign an additonal 2-3year contract with them, even though we just signed a 15 month contract with them 3 mos ago.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID icero9l with +98 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icero9l/) (in reply to ID vcfyu7):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID icff78j with +33 score by [(Rlvantage, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icff78j/) (in reply to ID icero9l):\nSmart!

After signing you went up to 9. If thier logic stands you shouldn't have to pay for the extra ee's. If they want to charge you more then they need to produce a new contract at that point you can tell them they don't meet your needs anymore.

For example: a money back guarantee for 30 days, but they respond to you with vague emails 2 or 3 times during the span of three weeks. There's no way to call them, no way of contacting them except by email. \n\nYou're just wasting time and they know that. \n\nBottom line, stop thinking about it and get legal help.

I haven't seen anyone attempt to explain to you why your contract is structured the way it is. Everyone seems to just be acting like it's unreasonable. I'm not saying it isn't, but I'll add context from 20 years in managed services. \n\nYou engaged in a fixed fee contract for services. You should have signed a scope that explained the services that would be provided, options to scale up, and a term. You alluded to most of that in your op. Once you signed that, the company began work to onboard you into the technology, and subsequently hired people (account execs, help desk techs, sys admins, payroll professionals, etc.) based on having to support 9 users for your business for the next 15 months. \n\nThen, somehow, you restructured within 3 months, going from 9 to 25 employees and back down to 15. \n\nMost managed services companies deal with this in a handful of ways. \n\n1. They up your contracted number of users. Ie: they onboard new users for no upfront cost, and they hire additional personnel to meet the scope you signed originally. You can scale up, you can't scale down. \n2. They continue to bill for the 9, but t&m the shit out of you for everything else. Ie: you'd have probably paid several thousand for the amount of movement you had in 2 months. \n\nYou characterized this well when you said you made a mistake. You got into a managed services contract before you really had your business dialed in, and because you were unfamiliar with how they work, you're in a rough situation. \n\nMy advice: Tell the account exec in email that you did not understand the scaling terms in the contract, and that you do now. You're not going to pay them an extra $800/month for the next 12 months, but you would like to better understand how to avoid this situation for flux/temp staff in the future. If they have no options, execute whatever cancellation terms are in the contract, and inform them of your new provider. \n\nSide note: they're probably going to charge you to transition the services to a new provider. That work is usually not within the scope of the agreement. \n\nTL;DR - You oofed. Own it, look for reasonable resolution. Don't make the same mistake in the future. Exit if they can't be amenable to that.\n\n### Comment ID icg9tpj with +3 score by [(Rlvantage, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icg9tpj/) (in reply to ID icg4jq3):\nAppreciate the advice!

Glad to see you're reading all this stuff!\n\nRe: onboarding\n\nThere are two types of onboarding and offboarding activities. \n\n1. Onboarding of the operation - this is when you first start your relationship. The firm will come out and document all kinds of things about your operation that they need to perform their scope of work and roll out any technology tool sets that are required. This is either invoiced as a one time line item with a lower per user rate over the term of the agreement, or it is included in the rate over the term of the agreement. If it's included in the per user rate, that will impact drawdown schedules for early termination. Offboardings, likewise are not part of the service. Transfer of accounts, documentation, removal of toolsets, or decommission of assets. All of that requires labor not contemplated in the agreement. \n2. User/employee onboarding/offboardings - this is what happens when you hire/terminate personnel. Documentation updates, account provisioning/termination, workstation set up, training, etc. Non stable state activity. Again, some services may include these at different rates, or give you x amount of these per month/year for free, but you pay after. It sounded (and I could have this wrong) like you didn't have to pay anything when you ramped up to 25 users, you just had the higher rate.\n\nI couldn't find your email comment, but if they aren't willing to accept that you didn't understand the terms, and you do now, then move on.\n\nGood luck with your business!\n\n## Comment ID icej7s5 with +6 score by [(fernguitars, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icej7s5/) (in reply to ID vcfyu7):\nJust get rid of 'em. Number one rule in business is when someone screws up or screws around with the money, there are no second chances.

For clarification for everyone, the way the contract works is if you add an employee, you are basically signing up for that license for the rest of the contract term (whatever is remaining out of the 15 months, where typically the first 3 were free.) That is an un-ideal situation if you are a seasonal employer and may peak during some months and then go back down. User licenses can be re-assigned, but you would need to terminate/offboard an employee before hiring a new one for that to work effectively. So it sounds as though as one time the poster did have a full 25 employees, but now has no use for the excess licenses.  We try to time our start dates if we know someone else is leaving to avoid being stuck with these dead licenses for the rest of the contract term. The quantity reset back down to the actual number of employees as the start of the next contract term, but I agree it is a deeply negative part of their contracts, especially when all services are stacked on top of each other, you end up having to pay for seats for every module whether you use them or not.  If you expect to have a highly fluctuating headcount, It would probably be best to stay away from Rippling or see if you can negotiate a different deal... but unlikely.\n\n## Comment ID kzvjg7s with +1 score by [(RudeEnd8411, Reddit, 2024-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/kzvjg7s/) (in reply to ID vcfyu7):\n**Does anyone have a phone number Rippling?

Taping to a solid surface  it all the way around the perimeter helps but doesn’t stop it.

Paper quality is critical to wc painting. Paint just behaves very differently.\n\nTape it down to a board before painting. That will prevent most buckling, unless you are doing very wet washes.\n\nYou can learn about soaking and stretching your paper before hand, and either stapling it or taping it, but it’s not really necessary, at least at this stage.\n\nRegular painter’s tape will do (although coloured tapes interfere somewhat with your pigment choices.) There is something called Artist’s Tape, but it is more expensive.\n\nBefore you use the tape though, stick it to your jeans etc 1-2x to remove excess glue. Then tape down your paper.\n\nWhen done and you remove the tape, keep it at a 45° angle and pull slowly. If there’s any sign of tearing, just use a blowdryer to heat up the tape as you remove it.\n\nHave fun!\n\n#### Comment ID j380390 with +3 score by [(BabyImafool, Reddit, 2023-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watercolor/comments/104hq4j/new_to_watercolor_how_to_block_paper_to_avoid/j380390/) (in reply to ID j35c39r):\nYou can also watercolor on some art canvas.

It’s like a watercolor sketch pad but instead of just the top/side being sealed to the spine, all of it is sealed down to prevent buckling. When it’s dry you just take it off of the pad and it’s much less bumpy than normal paper. The Arches watercolor blocks are 10/10. Lower quality watercolor paper or non watercolor paper will pretty much always do that though, regardless of whether you tape it down or not.

Arches will certainly do so.  Increasing the gsm will help.  That is a 90-lb paper will always buckle more than a 140 lb and a 300 lb paper will rarely buckle.\n\nThe art books for watercolor frequently are about a 90 pound.\n\nStonehenge Legion will very rarely buckle even at 140 lb.  Frequently cheaper than Arches because only 1 side is usable.\n\nTwinrocker 140 lb will not buckle but Twin Rocker is $17 for a 22\"x30\" sheet.  I'm still in learning mode, so this brand is out of my affordability.\n\nGenuinely stretching paper is a bit challenging but if you've got a technique down for that, even 90 lb paper won't buckle.  Basically you soak the paper until soft, then clamp firmly into place so it shrinks as it dries.  The clamping (or your preferred method) forces it to dry taut as a drum head.\n\n### Comment ID j37sg17 with +2 score by [(Old-Basil-5567, Reddit, 2023-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watercolor/comments/104hq4j/new_to_watercolor_how_to_block_paper_to_avoid/j37sg17/) (in reply to ID j35hkx9):\nIve done this like one does a canvas over a frame.

Listing reasons below.\n\n1. Before even reading this, please read the reviews on [Blind](https://www.teamblind.com/company/Rippling/reviews) especially the ones for shit wlb, management, and culture.\n2. You won't be overworked as an intern(6-7 hrs daily for me), but you will **suffer** as a full timer. My mentor said multiple times hes worked weekends + 12+ hour days to get stuff done and said multiple times he's overloaded and \"dying\" (obv in quotes)\n   1. I've talked with multiple other teams about potential work and **all** of them looked like they wanted out and lost so much hair\n3. You think you're gonna learn stuff because its a unicorn? No fucking way here.\n   1. **Everything** and I mean **Everything** is based on output and getting shit done. No one gives a **fuck** about code quality and all you are is a code monkey.\n   2. There are multiple severe incidents a week and people have gotten fired for causing too many incidents\n      1. An incident where some IC helped => manager didn't like looking bad => the goddamn IC gets fired for helping FFS IMFAO\n   3. Oh yea no one gives a fuck about scaling here. We've lost a significant amount of customers because the product was too slow\n4. You know how Citadel has clawbacks for bonuses if you leave within the first year? Its kind of similar to Rippling but for ur paper stocks. Leave within 1 year and you get nada.\n   1. People have been fired before vesting in order not to pay out.\n5. Management is **draconian.**\n   1. If you're higher up and Parker/C Suite/EM's/PM's don't like you, you're out the door\n   2. Multiple good EM's have been fired\n   3. The new CTO is laying off EM's in order for his previous coworkers to come in and become the first \"VPs\"\n      1. We also fired our past CTO G.B. after a few months lol. Like a horse trying to lead donkeys on redbull to the moon\n6. Your manager does not give a **fuck** about you. You exist for your managers benefit and to look good. They can sideswipe you at any time.\n7. Ripplings RSU share prices given to new hires right now is absolutely overvalued.\n8. People in the India office are completly overworked(everything here is SF related however). Pretty common to see them online at 10-11pm. Was curious a few times late night and saw a few coworkers online at 2-3am.\n9. You may think hey there are no layoffs so it must be good like those overvalued startups.\n   1. We don't have layoffs we have PIPs and random firings instead\n10. You might think the wlb rating  [here](https://www.rippling.com/life) on their website is high and accurate you say?\n11. Those surveys they send arent anonymous. Disagree too much and you get fired. You don't need to include them in the data if they're fired rofl\n12. You think a \"high\" TC is better than all this? Here's the cherry on top\n13. Guess what the CTO doesn't believe in signing bonuses any more and RSU was reduced such that ur TC is around 20% lower. (230-250K tc => 190-210k tc \\[150 base is the same\\]).\n14. Go fucking work for Citadel pay if you want Citadel culture and management lol. No way 150 in base is enough to justify this shit.\n\n### Comment ID j6tqicc with +5 score by [(throwawaynoturtwin, Reddit, 2023-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zmyzdk/what_is_the_consensus_on_rippling/j6tqicc/) (in reply to ID j0eh1zo):\ncurrent FT, obligatory i think experience is very team dependent.

The shares cannot be sold (sometimes you can on equity zen, but does not seem guaranteed), so while you have $X worth of stock, you can't turn that into money.\n\nWhen the company stock IPOs two things happen: the stock can now be sold for cash, and (one would hope) the value of the stock increases. So people that were getting a bunch of 'paper money' (levels.fyi says EM's get about 600k per year) can now turn that into real money, assuming it vested, and if the valuation goes up so does your TC, effectively. A success story is Warby Parker, which seems to have doubled in valuation in the year leading up to their IPO: in this example, the EM's stock would go from 600k to 1.2 million.\n\nThis can go the other way though: sometimes stocks tank. If someone were to sign an offer at Roblox just preIPO (they direct listed, but still), 2/3rds of their RSU has now halved in price.\n\nTL;DR (because I am super rambly)\n\npre-IPO stock is not worth any real money, so companies give it out more freely. When the company IPOs, this fake money becomes real money, and now you have a lot of money.\n\n## Comment ID j0foi0v with +1 score by [(doubletagged, Reddit, 2022-12-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zmyzdk/what_is_the_consensus_on_rippling/j0foi0v/) (in reply to ID zmyzdk):\nIt is definitely not big tech/manga adjacent",

They help companies achieve SOC2 and other security/privacy certifications. The Vanta agent which gets installed on workstations collects a bunch of information about the configuration of your workstation and reports back to their platform, which is then used as compliance evidence for their regular audits.\n\nThe MDM likely doesn't do any tracking by default - they're there mostly to enforce certain configuration parameters (disk encryption, screen lock timeouts, etc). That said, it's trivial for them to be able to use the MDM to push out any other type of monitoring that is deemed appropriate by company leadership.\n\nI am not a fan of dragnet-style monitoring, but I have in a few cases, been asked by company leadership to perform some more detailed monitoring on a case-by-case basis - things like collecting browser history, etc. Once an MDM is installed, things like this are very easy.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID jgnl5rp with +1 score by [(alephthirteen, Reddit, 2023-04-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/jgnl5rp/) (in reply to ID 12pi5k6):\nTL;DR Getting a tablet or Chromebook or even a new MacBook Air to browse the web is going to be way cheaper and less disruptive to your life than ***getting a new job***. Don't think about how likely it is they'll catch you. That's the wrong framework. Think about whether being fired would be a hassle. I imagine it would be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like you are in a remote work situation? They probably aren't filming your house--some companies do demand the webcam stays on, but not many--but everything on the device should be **assumed** to be company monitored. Their money, after all.\n\n\\- They quite possibly can see your web history. Not via the MDM itself, but any number of VPNs or filtering softwares do this.- They almost certainly can tell what apps you install.- Whatever security/endpoint software they install could have tons of other capabilities, too. Keystroke monitoring, logging what devices you plug in, etc.\n\nI'm in IT and the guy in charge of keeping the Macs compliant, so I need to be walking the walk. I'm a big fan of watching a YouTube or two in the breakroom over lunch, so people don't chase me down for tickets. I put my iPad in my bag and leave it off until I'm at lunch, put my phone in hotspot, then pull up whatever and watch it. Full division. Not their WiFi network. Not their gear. No one disturbed (except perhaps by my weird laugh).\n\nIf it's something that needs something more power than say, a basic iPad, Android tablet or Chromebook can do, I'd recommend you take a step back and think again, not about whether they'll catch you but whether you should be doing it on company time. Pull out your phone and make a note of the URL if it's a cool article you want to read, then read it later. If it's music, do it on your phone. Other things, maybe just do it after work.\n\nBut I wouldn't be doing Photoshop freelancing or playing Civ 6 or development in Docker containers or whatever on company time, and I can't think what else might need that much power. Most things that might be legit background stuff for WFH could also be done by your phone.\n\nIf you're freelancing, first, check if your contract allows it. And if your contract allows it, you should ***absolutely not*** be doing that on hardware they paid for.\n\n## Comment ID jgoibku with +1 score by [(slykido999, Reddit, 2023-04-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/jgoibku/) (in reply to ID 12pi5k6):\nIf ever you’re concerned about what IT can do to the computer you’re using, you should do it on your own personally owned computer without MDM.\n\n## Comment ID k08fcay with +1 score by [(ratatouille_artist, Reddit, 2023-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/k08fcay/) (in reply to ID 12pi5k6):\nI just installed Vanta myself and luckily it doesn't seem too intrusive.

Today we'll be continuing the technique discussion series with Ophelia's Rippling Sword!

Actually I was under the impression (and for a very long time) that it may have worked like a sort of electric chainsaw technique in the way the sword could vibrate, and therefore it would also give it an improved cutting aspect. Now that I read these panels again more carefully, it's definitely not the point, and as correctly pointed out in the OP, it works more in the vein or principle of the undulating illusion, indeed similar to the \"rubber pencil trick\".\n\nI wonder if I was the only one under this impression? Anyway, it's a tricky technique, specially  for someone like Clare when she faced Ophelia... not only was Ophelia much stronger for Clare to handle, she had a pretty big counter-move for Clare's ace at the time (her pre-emptive yoki detection).\n\nThe technique on the whole seems quite strong, according to the databooks, it has a mid-moderate to high yoki input (45-66%) and is almost dead center in the graph of speed and power (or more towards power if looking at the pointers). Compared to other similar techniques in the databook graph, It was comparatively stronger and faster than Clare's own Quicksword pre-timeskip, but lagged behind Flora's Windcutter (both aspects), Irene's Quicksword (much slower but about the same in power) and Clare's combined Quicksword + Pre-emptive yoki detection (in both aspects).\n\nI'd say the advantages of the technique are a) very effective against orthodox or simple/normal sword strikes, blocks and parries due to the circumventing nature of the rippling or undulating strike; b) it can catch anyone with no previous knowledge quite off-guard; c) as the case with Clare, it can work really well against opponents who have the particular fighting style of using or relying heavily on their senses. \n\nBasically the closer you allow or let Ophelia continuously engage with that kind of movement, the more advantageous her position will be. In that sense the technique also reminds of a snake, that sticks close and gradually suffocates its victim to death. That would go for advantage d) I guess and also the ideal combat condition for it: an edge thus for very close exchanges. If the move isn't conclusive, the contiual exchanges and defense penetrating strikes would eventually weigh on the receiving end of the Rippling Sword.\n\nWith all that said, I also think the technique is counterable. And it may not necessarily take another fanciful technique like the Quicksword to do it.\n\nThe first way is by out-reaching it, however that may be. Awakened beings can easily do this by using their multitude of elongating appendages, and some techniques can have a better range/reach than others. I think the reason the Quicksword is able to counter Ophelia's Rippling Sword is not because it's necessarily \"superior\" in some sense, but because it can certainly out-reach it (either by range or by move initiative) so it avoids the penetrating effect where the Rippling Sword can be deadly.\n\nThe other way I imagine it could be countered, and using just simple sword strikes and swordsmanship skill  (granted it would probably take a very gifted or skilled warrior to pull it out), would be by trying to always guesstimate and target the contact more towards the tip or the extreme of the sword \"ripple\". In doing so and combining with a good adjusted range it could potentially repel the strike before it \"penetrates\" or not giving it room for the blade to slide. It would take a lot of adjusting too (both on range and strike contact) but that's when skill and experience comes in.\n\nAs for how the Rippling Sword relates or match Ophelia: as it was stated before and by others, in many ways the movement and technique reminds of a snake, and so does Ophelia. Ophelia's own awakened form is one that resembles a snake, snakewoman or lamia.\n\nOphelia is treacherous and a very predatory individual. Her atittude towards awakened, the way she sees them as her prey, the thrill she feels when fighting them, and also the way she often makes games and plays with her victims when they're completely overwhelmed is incredibly cruel and predatory. Surprisingly, that extends not only to awakened but also even to her own comrades and humans. Ophelia may be a victim in the grand scheme of things and a very traumatized person, but because of that she ended up becoming a very twisted and feared individual.\n\nLastly, another thing that striked me while re-reading these chapters with Ophelia, and that is something that's probably not limited to Ophelia but probably the most likely way most techniques are created, is that she actually sought to create the technique so she could make a name for herself, influenced by some of her contemporaries who already had one (Phantom Miria and Dark Alicia for instance). I find it interesting how Claymores actively try to create something that sets them apart, and gives them some sort of identity.\n\nAfter all, besides their purpose of ridding human of the plague of yoma and AB's, these are warriors that live for the sword and the battleground. This is their lives, their way... living among many of similarly groomed contemporaries, and countless others that have came before them. Things like the prestige of a high rank or the notoriety of a catchy and well justified moniker/nickname are pretty huge deals for these girls.\n\n### Comment ID cvp2bcr with +2 score by [(DekuNut, Reddit, 2015-10-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/claymore/comments/3mv9tn/technique_talk_tuesdays_rippling_sword/cvp2bcr/) (in reply to ID cvlkcwj):\nYoo sorry for the last response. I've been meaning to reply for a while but just haven't gotten around to it :(\n  \nInteresting first impression of the Rippling Sword! That would indeed be pretty devastating, and I wonder if the insane number of undulations per second wouldn't add some sort of additional offensive power your her blade.\n \nI'm not surprised at it's power/speed output according to those data books. Ophelia was strong, no doubt, and she developed the Rippling Sword purely for offensive. And being number 4, she obviously was comfortable pouring a moderate amount of Yoki into one arm to use the technique. But I felt that her technique was rather rough, as in, not optimized nearly as much as it could have been, like she thought of and created it within a day. So, it's strong and fast on the surface, but when compared to later techniques, or techniques created by other strong warriors, it lagged behind.\n \nIt's sort of like that one bandit's Falcon Sword, as it catches the unsuspected off guard (at least that's what I've always compared it to). I liked your comparison of the Rippling Sword to a snake's constriction! It's a shame the only two receivers of the technique were either much less skilled than Ophelia, or much more skilled. Though I think your interpretation of how a close fight would go is pretty good.\n \nOutreaching is definitely a good way to counter it. In fact, I think it's implied that Ophelia didn't create the technique to fight Awakened Beings, but rather those with swords...so she probably never took into account the weakness to ranged attacks. I see what you're saying about the second method of defense, too. Almost like using the sword's own momentum against itself. Thee is one warrior later on (Audrey, I think) who's main method of fighting is \"using her sword to reflect her opponent's attack using minimal strength to create a defense which counteracts her opponent's attacks. \" So I'd like to see a fight between Audrey and Ophelia!\n\nAbout your last point, that's a very clever observation. I suppose a large part of creating a technique that's all your own is to set yourself apart, make yourself known. When your in an organization where all your comrades are simply known by their symbol and ranking, having something that possibly reflects your individuality along with (literally making a name for yourself on the battleground...it must be a goal some strive to reach. I think part of it also is simply developing a technique to ensure your own chances of survival against enemies is increased.\n\n#### Comment ID cvpd6pj with +2 score by [(Rikugo, Reddit, 2015-10-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/claymore/comments/3mv9tn/technique_talk_tuesdays_rippling_sword/cvpd6pj/) (in reply to ID cvp2bcr):\nNo problem! I'm like that too sometimes, taking way too long to reply to some messages.\n\nYeah, even if it's probably innacurate looking at Ophelia's case, the effect I thought the technique had with that first impression would eventually be applied to Alicia's awakened form, with the small vibrating blades that add to her scythes cutting power.\n\nI also get a similar impression given the told story of Ophelia's Rippling Sword. Something that looks more designed to be shown to her fellow warriors (which in most occasions wouldn't bode well for them). The observation of how it's relatively ill suited against awakened beings is a good one. And Audrey is a good call, she would fit well with this second mold of warrior I was describing. Doesn't seem to have a very flashy technique (Soft Sword I suppose), but looks very refined in skill and focused on her swordsmanship. I think that would make for a very balanced contest, with Audrey having no qualms to hold back and show her craft and ability by adapting, adjusting and hopefully overcoming the Rippling Sword with her praised sword skills.\n\n## Comment ID cviertd with +1 score by [(mortal_sword, Reddit, 2015-09-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/claymore/comments/3mv9tn/technique_talk_tuesdays_rippling_sword/cviertd/) (in reply to ID 3mv9tn):\nHaha yes, I've been waiting for this!

If this is true it makes her far more impressive, and makes Ilena more impressive for blocking it.\n\nThe other possibility is that it simply slides under the opponent's blade by having her blade move liquidly around it... This logically makes more sense but makes less sense physically - her sword would have simply struck Clare's from the other side after \"slipping\" around it if it were vibrating so fast. We also haven't seen the swords be able to bend/break whatsoever so it's a littler unbelievable that Ophelia could do so.\n\n### Comment ID cviykms with +1 score by [(DekuNut, Reddit, 2015-09-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/claymore/comments/3mv9tn/technique_talk_tuesdays_rippling_sword/cviykms/) (in reply to ID cvigj3h):\nI *think* the trick with the technique is that the sword is making such quick, minute movements, that it only *appears* to be vibrating/moving liquidly.

It seems to be a combination of too low z height and a bed that's too uneven for Prusa's bed leveling to compensate for, even on 7x7. \nI applied the nylock leveling method to my bed and was able to get the variance down to 0.02mm. After that it was much easier to set a correct layer height that works across the whole bed and it seems to have done the trick.",

It happened with Prusament using the Prusament preset in Prusa Slicer, and again with Hatchbox PLA using the Hatchbox PLA preset.  The only thing that seemed to help a little was using live adjust Z while printing, but the MK4 does not save that setting between prints.  After speaking with Prusa support multiple times and verifying lots of sensor values, it looks like the loadcel sensor is not returning expected values, which would certainly impact bed leveling and result in this type of issue.

Some of these I'd re-bag, and in another 6+ months, the bags would be rippled again. Interestingly, the vast majority of the comics were IDW series, primarily TMNT and GI JOE along with a few others. I've had many more IDW and Image and other indie books get rippled bags than Big Two books, especially in the short term.  All that said, my conclusion is that the bags are affected by some quality or aspect of the cover paper or the ink, or some part of the printing process that might be used or more heavily used, at least, by IDW for example but not Marvel and DC.\n\n## Comment ID jzq3wpp with +2 score by [(Comic_Books_Forever, Reddit, 2023-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookcollecting/comments/16d77a5/why_are_my_bags_rippling_like_this/jzq3wpp/) (in reply to ID 16d77a5):\nAll printed items off-gas because there is acidity involved. That is why you will have sometimes a musty, vinegar like smell to some books. It’s affecting the bag a bit but it’s not as major nowadays.

My clients appreciate them as do I for the most part.\n\nBambooHR, unfortunately, my experience has not been as kind, but I also don't have appropriate market experience. My only client with them grew from 10 employees to 3,000 and never left Bamboo (but started with just HRIS, nor HRIS+Payroll), and has tried to cobble together APIs with other platforms to keep costs down. It's tough at the moment. Biggest pain with Bamboo (IMO) is the complete inability to just pick up the phone and call someone that can help you.\n\nNo direct account manager/or pod, everything is email/ticket/wait for a call/email back.\n\n### Comment ID lvu78fc with +4 score by [(shinyseashells22, Reddit, 2024-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1glee9d/rippling_vs_bamboohr_na/lvu78fc/) (in reply to ID lvtrm5p):\nI use Bamboo and have to disagree, they have the most helpful customer service and I call them up.

Rippling also has an automated system where you can automate your work process. For example, depending on the qualifying life event, an employees request for time off will trigger a string of emails & notifications to the appropriate team members. Same system is triggered when health insurance comes into play - especially useful when you have employees across the country.\n\nDown-side of Rippling: it's expensive. They continously upsell on all their 3rd party apps & upgrades. Customer service is not immediate either, especially when it comes to fixing tax related issues.\n\nIf you want something similar to Rippling, Paylocity is so much better & you ca speak with a human being ASAP when you need assistance. Rippling outsourced their summer service to outside the country, so good luck.\n\n## Comment ID m2q7a3p with +1 score by [(mandalayx, Reddit, 2024-12-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/1glee9d/rippling_vs_bamboohr_na/m2q7a3p/) (in reply to ID 1glee9d):\nRippling is weird in the sense that you have to submit payroll by Monday for a Friday payroll.

At this point, the company is really no longer a start-up, yet still has this start up mentality internally. You're constantly fixing mistakes from inept managers/sales teams who can't think on a broader level. \n- Micromanagement: You will be micro managed. For as much autonomy as you are theoretically given, Rippling doesn't have the engineering/product resources to actually execute solutions, so you'll end up with a project proposal that either gets ignored or pushed to Q4. So when all is said and done, you'll be blamed for not being able to fix an issue, even though you tried. \n- No career growth: Sure, if you work in sales maybe you'll get promoted to senior, or manager, but outside that? Good luck. \n- No yearly salary increases: Said what I said. Don't expect to make more money once you start so negotiate that salary hard. \n- Horrific wlb: You're always on. Holidays, days off, sick days. You are always on.",

Work-life balance can be difficult to maintain due to high turnover in the implementation department, often resulting in additional workload.\n\nMorale remains a concern, and there is a noticeable disconnect with the sales organization. The frequent turnover and assignment of implementation managers who may require further development in technical, project management, and soft skills pose challenges in maintaining a cohesive team environment. We did have an off-site though, and it was good to connect in person.\n\nThe recent departure of our VP of Implementation, similar to the previous VP's exit, has led to more concerns about the health of the organization. Unfortunately, this will lead to the promotion of a senior director who ultimately drove all of the senior managers and directors away over a year ago.",

You are interacting with really smart people and teams on a day to day basis, and hence learning and growing.\n\nOpen and improved engineering culture: There aren't any boundaries on people to go and learn, major engineering projects are put in open for others to discuss and learn. The engineering team and culture has improved vastly in the last 2 years, with a lot of seasoned staff and senior staff engineers in the org.\n\nProduct and revenue growth: Rippling's clarity in what they want to build had been astonishing from day 1. Some of the products that we recently launched are things that comp any had in their plan from day 1. There is so much conviction and clarity into all the product and engineering investment that most of our products launched scale from 0 to few millions of revenue within their first year.

I suspect this sentiment extends to others I have yet to speak with, mirroring the prevailing mood among the 10-15 individuals I regularly engage with over the past six months.\n\nIt is crucial to invest in cultivating a culture of trust that encourages employees to remain engaged beyond the initial hiring phase. Currently, there is a pervasive sense of fear and disillusionment among employees, often surfacing within the first 1-3 months of their tenure.\n\nWhile the company offers a competitive base salary, the subpar benefits package is hindering our ability to attract and retain top talent. Other employers, even with a slightly lower base compensation, are luring prospective employees with superior benefits, including affordable health insurance for dependents, 401k matching, office amenities, wellness programs, and professional development stipends.\n\nRippling holds great potential to become a leading tech company, but urgent attention is needed to address the toxic burnout culture, enhance overall benefits, and stabilize product quality for sustained success.",

Our team has also gotten to be true advocates, fiercely defend our employees from aggressive competitor tactics, pulling together a first rate immigration program for our team, commanding one of the most efficient sales/commercial processes. In short, it is really fun (and rare) to help win as a business, while also doing it the right way and with flair. And we have fun :) \n\nRippling is also one of the most transparent places that I have worked in that, top down and bottoms up, people actually say what they are thinking and have discussions. While candor can take some getting used to (and for some, may seem like a con), it has meant that this has been the least political and bureaucratic place that I have ever worked. There's simply has been no room for politics (giving off appearance instead of reality) because people say whats on their mind, ask a lot of questions, and \"go and see\" what the truth/reality is.",

I was fortunate to be promoted to a leadership role, which speaks volumes about Rippling's investment in its employees' growth and career trajectory opportunities. \n\nThe culture here is bar none. It's fast-paced and innovative, but also incredibly collaborative and supportive. Everyone is passionate about what they do, and that energy is contagious. You get to talk about the best platform in the game on a daily basis as Rippling is a true \"game changer\" in the industry, \n\nIf you're looking for a place to challenge yourself, learn from talented colleagues, and be part of something truly special, Rippling is definitely worth considering. \n\nThe executive team is first class all around and they truly care about everyone here, all while building something special.

The overall vibe at Rippling is “you are lucky to work here, so you take what you’re given.” This has worked for them so far in the startup phase, but I see this crumbling in the near future. You can’t have the turnover this company has and execute a successful longterm strategy.\n-generally, middle managers are inexperienced and aren’t on your side\n-work-life balance is non-existent and in fact, the CEO has said in so many words that he doesn’t believe in it\n-there doesn’t seem to be an overall vision or strategy: for the product, for company initiatives, for any part of Rippling.

How can you expect customers to have a good experience when you’re not even supporting the people who are client-facing at this company?

The reviews that state work life balance is awful are 100% true, and unfortunately, you will likely burn out before the company reaches their IPO anyway. This isn’t necessarily Ripplings fault entirely, it’s just that payroll, benefits, Hr is a grueling awful vertical to play in. You’ll quickly get tired of clients complaining about almost every aspect of the product. Trust me, it brings your life down so much that you’ll start questioning your career path. The executive team in this company needs to realize that sometimes building new SKU’s for the sake of new SKU’s is not going to sit well with your current client base. Current client enhancements can go often ignored… I expect a relatively high client churn rate for the next few years, before management gets the clue and maybe 180’s their strategy. They’ll need to do this before it’s too late and total ARR starts moving in the wrong direction. Product is struggling to scale to enterprise level/quality, but that’s a challenge at all SaaS companies. If you’re okay grinding and saying goodbye to your friends and family, then this may be an okay place for you. Otherwise, find a better SaaS vertical to play in.",

It seemed random when certain employees were let go and it was never consistent in terms of performance and how long someone may be underperforming for. On top of that, my leaders would see how stressed I was, and never asked how I was doing, the only thing was whats the next task or deal, never time to breathe. Offer clear expectations and promotion paths, stop changing pay and making it confusing to the point where reps have 5+ calls to understand it, and take better care of your employees cause they aren’t a number and I can guarantee a huge number of them are burnt out.",

For some promotions seem easy and happen quick, and for others, its seems impossible. I was over 110% quota for a 12-14 month period and those performing below me and those with less tenure got interviews and roles in segments higher than me. On top of that, they kept giving me more responsibilities on top of the hundreds of accounts I managed (300-600 accounts). Those responsibilities included training 3 new hires at the same time, helping those I was not assigned too because some managers wouldn’t help them, and even training people at the management level. Not once did I get a pay raise (only decreases), or even an interview for an up segment role even though I voiced my want for that and a pay raise my last 6+months there. Managing that many accounts also leaved almost no time to get work done but management is constantly hounding you to have everything up to date. When you have 7 sales calls a day and about 50 emails coming in every day its almost impossible. I was working from 8-8 almost every day, and only to be thanked by pay decrease, confusing quota changes that decreased pay, and not a single look or real conversation about my future.",

The demand for quick results and constant change may lead to a high-pressure environment.\n\nWork-Life Balance Challenges: Due to the dynamic and ambitious culture, some employees may find it difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Long hours and the expectation to remain responsive can occasionally interfere with personal time.\n\nRole Ambiguity: As with many fast-growing companies, there may be some uncertainty about job roles and responsibilities, particularly in the early stages of employment or in newly created positions. Employees may need to adapt quickly to shifting expectations.\n\nHeavy Workload: Some employees report that the workload can be intense, particularly during peak periods. This can lead to burnout if not managed effectively.\n\nLimited Remote Opportunities for Some Roles: While Rippling does offer remote work options for many positions, some roles might require employees to work from the office, limiting flexibility for those seeking full-time remote opportunities.\n\nGrowing Pains: As a company experiencing rapid growth, Rippling may face some challenges related to scalability, including potential inefficiencies in processes, evolving company policies, and a lack of formalized structures in some areas.\n\nHigh Expectations: Rippling hires driven, ambitious individuals, and the high expectations placed on employees may not suit everyone. People looking for a more laid-back or less demanding work environment may find this culture difficult to adapt to.\n\nLimited Focus on Employee Perks: While Rippling offers solid compensation and benefits, some employees may feel that certain perks or initiatives, like wellness programs or additional employee benefits, are not as robust compared to other tech companies.\n\nThese cons are worth considering when evaluating Rippling as an employer, especially if work-life balance or clear structure are important to you. However, many employees thrive in the company's fast-paced and dynamic environment, so the experience can vary depending on role and individual preferences.",

If you are a great figure-outer and can do your own research, you will do well at Rippling. They also have lots of office hours and extra training sessions, as well as Slack channels to help answer questions and further your knowledge.\n\nThe system is so user friendly that you and clients can figure out a lot on their own.

A lot of people who work here are kind and cool people but everyone is running around with their heads chopped off. -If you want to be so stressed out of your mind that you stop eating, lose your quality of life, then work here.

This isn’t necessarily Ripplings fault entirely, it’s just that payroll, benefits, Hr is a grueling awful vertical to play in. You’ll quickly get tired of clients complaining about almost every aspect of the product. Trust me, it brings your life down so much that you’ll start questioning your career path. The executive team in this company needs to realize that sometimes building new SKU’s for the sake of new SKU’s is not going to sit well with your current client base. Current client enhancements can go often ignored… I expect a relatively high client churn rate for the next few years, before management gets the clue and maybe 180’s their strategy. They’ll need to do this before it’s too late and total ARR starts moving in the wrong direction. Product is struggling to scale to enterprise level/quality, but that’s a challenge at all SaaS companies. If you’re okay grinding and saying goodbye to your friends and family, then this may be an okay place for you. Otherwise, find a better SaaS vertical to play in.",

Our team has also gotten to be true advocates, fiercely defend our employees from aggressive competitor tactics, pulling together a first rate immigration program for our team, commanding one of the most efficient sales/commercial processes. In short, it is really fun (and rare) to help win as a business, while also doing it the right way and with flair.

      "# [Rippling Announces Series F Fundraising & Tender Offer by Parker Conrad on 2024-04-22](https://www.rippling.com/blog/rippling-announces-series-f-fundraising-and-tender-offer)\nWe’re pleased to announce Rippling has raised $200M in new financing, and signed agreements with investors to repurchase up to $590M of equity from current employees, former employees, and early investors. The financing was led by Coatue with participation from Founders Fund, Greenoaks, and other existing investors. Dragoneer is joining the round as a new investor.\n\nThe financing values the company at $13.5 billion.\n\nWe’re grateful for these investors’ conviction in Rippling, for the employees that have gotten us to this point, and for our clients, without whom none of this would be possible.\n\nRippling’s core thesis is that employee data is critical to a surprisingly large number of business systems, including the ones well outside of HR.\n\nMaintaining the fidelity of the same employee data across all these disconnected systems—effectively, across multiple separate databases—is the reason it’s a lot of work for companies to have many different business systems in the first place. Rippling solves this problem by giving companies and employees a single place to make changes, which then propagate everywhere automatically.\n\nThe system that does this isn’t just a time-saver—we believe it will be a critical primitive for business software going forward.\n\nProducts that are built on top of a rich graph of data about the organization, employees, their devices and apps aren’t just easier to manage. They are better as software products—with more intelligent workflows and approvals, better role-based policies and permissions, and more powerful analytics.\n\nThis system we’ve built helps companies run more efficiently and achieve their business goals faster than their competitors. We will continue to expand in new markets and invest deeply in R&D to enhance our current offering and build new products to support our clients.\n\nTo better understand Rippling’s approach and where we’re headed, you can read a lightly redacted version of the memo I wrote for investors ahead of this financing.",

      "# [Rippling Launches Performance Management by People Center Inc. dba Rippling on 2024-05-08](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/05/08/2877869/0/en/Rippling-Launches-Performance-Management.html)\nSAN FRANCISCO, May 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rippling, the leading unified workforce management platform, today launched Performance Management. With Performance Management, Rippling customers can run global performance review cycles with 360º feedback, calibrate ratings confidentially, and run compensation processes including bonus payments. They can set up merit matrices and push changes directly to payroll. Rippling also supports year-round performance with triggered milestone reviews, goal setting, and soon, 1:1s.\n\nUnlike point solutions or legacy all-in-one systems, Performance Management is customizable to the business’s needs. And since all Rippling apps are natively built on top of the unified platform, clients can seamlessly connect performance data with other Rippling applications like Recruiting and Payroll as well as past cycle feedback and historical changes. As a result, reviews are always based on up-to-date employee attributes and can even be triggered at specific moments in the individual employee's lifecycle– all while ensuring complete control over who has access to performance data.\n\n“For HR leaders, unlocking employee talent is a top priority. But too often, they’re forced to design the performance management process around rigid, disconnected systems, rather than around the culture and the business’s needs,” said Darcy Mackay, Rippling’s SVP of HR and Client Services. “We want companies to stop managing spreadsheets and spend more time developing their people. Our Performance Management solution does just that.”\n\n“By removing the worry and arduousness of traditional review cycles, Rippling has helped us turn our performance management process into a strategic asset. We’re able to easily run an equitable, thorough, ongoing performance process for our team members and we’re already seeing the impact on our business,” said Laura Downey, LightForce’s HR Manager.\n\nRippling’s new Performance Management solution addresses the most common performance management pain points:\n\nAligning Employee Performance with Business Goals\n\nShared organizational goals are usually stored in a different system or locked in static documents, making it time-consuming to set and track an individual’s objectives and their progress against them. With Rippling, managers can quickly create goals, cascade them through their reporting line, and allocate ownership to specific members of their team. Likewise, instead of logging into a separate system, employees can review their goals regularly, using a system they’re in every day. And, because the Performance Management product connects to Rippling’s Employee Graph, business leaders can report on goal outcomes and trends alongside any other data in Rippling—including department, tenure, level and engagement surveys.\n\nLaunching Review Cycles\n\nTraditionally, launching a review cycle takes hours of manual work, especially if any customization is required. Because Rippling already understands a company’s roles and reporting structures, set-up is simplified and customization is painless. For example, you can create a full 360º review with upward, downward, and peer reviews. Within that cycle, you can decide how many peer reviews you want for each employee, specify unique questions for each department or reviewer, and even set rules about who should do the review if an employee transitioned managers during the review period.\n\nManaging Calibrations\n\nEnsuring reviews are consistent and fair usually requires hours of meetings and a plethora of spreadsheets– both in an effort to make sure no manager can view sensitive reviews and ratings information outside their scope. Because Rippling is built around one central source of truth for your organization, the system already knows which managers and HR business partners should have access to which employees’ information. It automatically handles all permissions, allowing appropriate managers and HR to compare and calibrate ratings directly in the app in either tabular or graphical format without having to use a single spreadsheet, eliminating the risk of confidential information falling into the wrong hands.\n\nStreamlining Compensation & Rewards\n\nAfter a typical review cycle, companies struggle not only with defining rewards schedules but also with sticking to their overall budget. Once compensation decisions are made, propagating those changes to a payroll system in an error-free manner is, at best, difficult and at worst, not even possible. This process often takes significant time after a review cycle, requiring endless spreadsheets and analysts to complete, resulting in review processes that can take many months to complete.\n\nRippling streamlines this entire process with built-in, customizable merit matrices, a real-time multi-currency view of a company’s overall rewards budget and dynamic policies that ensure an equitable process to help retain talent. This means any merit or level changes reflect automatically across the system, including payroll.\n\nConnecting Everything Together\n\nThe problem of disconnected systems is widespread. More than half of HR teams use seven or more point solutions. Legacy all-in-one systems, on the other hand, may share a common interface, but they lack configurability, preventing HR teams from tailoring review cycles to meet their particular organization’s needs. Often, privacy and data protection concerns are to blame for the fragmentation. But with Rippling’s Employee Graph at the core of every one of its products, including Performance Management, permissioning is already built in.\n\nAbout Rippling\n\nRippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance—globally. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, identity & access management, and device management. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.\n\nBased in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1.4B from the world's top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, and Bedrock.\n\nFor more information, visit Rippling.com.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nKristina Leal\n\nFirebrand Communications for Rippling\n\n415.848.9175\n\nrippling@firebrand.marketing",

      "# [Rippling Rolls Out AI-Powered Employee Evaluation Tool by PYMNTS, www.facebook.com on 2024-09-25](https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2024/rippling-rolls-out-ai-powered-employee-evaluation-tool/)\nWould you trust artificial intelligence-powered tools to conduct your employee evaluation?\n\nBusiness software startup Rippling hopes the answer is yes.\n\nThe company is launching a product called Talent Signal, which uses AI to gauge employee performance based on task-specific metrics, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (Sept. 25).\n\nThe tool can spot patterns a manager might not notice, helping companies better use resources while determining which employees may need fast-tracking or additional guidance, the report said.\n\n“In the ideal case, the manager would pull up a chair next to the employee and spend 90 days with them,” coaching them, said Rippling Chief Operating Officer Matt MacInnis, per the report.\n\nWhile few managers have time for that sort of effort, AI does, the report added. Those who have tested Talent Signal said the tool lets them set aside preconceived notions and look objectively as they evaluate an employee’s performance.\n\nMacInnis acknowledged some people might find the product unsettling, but it’s no less strange than a manager tracking a new employee, and it offers less bias, the report said.\n\nThe standard 90-day evaluation “can’t be about the vibe,” MacInnis said, per the report. “It’s got to be about the facts.”\n\nRippling’s workforce management platform combines human resources, informational technology and finance functions to create what it calls a “single source of truth” for employee data. The company raised $200 million in a Series F round in April that valued Rippling at $13.5 billion.\n\n“Rippling’s core thesis is that employee data is critical to a surprisingly large number of business systems, including the ones well outside of HR,” CEO Parker Conrad said at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, experts interviewed by PYMNTS have stressed the need for a balanced approach to AI that includes human intervention. Gillian Laging, co-founder of Scopey, a scope management platform, argued for built-in human oversight, pointing to her firm’s practice of having users review AI-drafted scopes of work before passing them on to clients.\n\n“This approach acknowledges that while AI can dramatically speed up certain processes, human judgment remains invaluable,” PYMNTS reported this month. “For instance, an AI might draft a comprehensive project scope, but a seasoned professional can spot nuances, potential issues or client-specific considerations that the AI might miss.”",

With the rise of remote work—and as companies continue to compete for top talent—people are joining teams from all over the world.\n\nAccess new markets to sell your product in. Some companies may start selling internationally to add new revenue streams, diversify their customer base, and get an edge over the competition.\n\nConsider your reasons for expanding globally—what goals are you hoping to achieve? At first, Rippling was motivated by talent—we wanted to hire more engineers and other roles from markets with deep talent pools and attractive cost dynamics. We also wanted to cover different timezones so we could support customers 24/7. In 2017, we opened our India office, which continues to be one of our major talent hubs, with around 800 people working there today.\n\nBut that’s a story for another day. We’ll focus this one on our journey expanding to new markets and serving customers around the world.\n\n2. Determine if it’s the right time to expand globally\n\nMany venture-backed companies feel pressure to scale into new markets before they’re set up to succeed internationally. Others expand too late and lag behind competitors. Timing is everything—but how do you know when the time is right?\n\nAt Rippling, we made the intentional decision to get our US engine set up and humming before taking it to new international markets. While serving global customers was our vision from day one, we wanted to iron out our core products, go-to-market messaging, and growth engine first. More importantly, we didn’t want to divert our resources or attention away from our HQ market (the US) until we had built a solid product and go-to-market foundation. By 2021, we were ready.\n\n3. Make sure you choose the right market\n\nOnce you decide to take your startup to a new market, how do you choose the right one?\n\nWe considered four key factors in our decision:\n\nExisting demand: When our US-based customers would expand into new markets, they’d ask us if Rippling could support them there. We recognized the massive opportunity in front of us to not only meet the demand of our existing customers but also our future ones.\n\nCompetitive landscape: We looked at the competition—both the legacy providers and the newer startups—in the markets we were exploring. Was there a clear and identifiable opportunity for Rippling to do it better?\n\nMarket size: A top-down analysis told us how large a market was but it didn’t tell us if it was a good fit for Rippling. A bottom-up approach, however, showed us the number of companies that fit our ideal customer profile (ICP) in a market.\n\nMarket complexity: Every country handles employment, wages, payroll taxes, and employee benefits differently. We had to evaluate the lift to localize our product and navigate complex new regulatory environments. The markets that are least similar to your HQ market are the hardest to take on. For our many target countries where English was not the primary language, we needed to not only consider our product but also how our team would interact with locals.\n\nOnce we ticked the boxes for the first three, we zeroed in on market complexity. Often, there are two options: pursue the markets most similar to the US or venture into the unknown. Expanding into similar markets is easier, but there’s one issue: our competitors think the same way. That’s why we decided to not only go after similar markets, but pour more into complex markets, like India. This is where we saw a bigger opportunity and less copycat competition.\n\nIn India, it’s very difficult to move money into the country due to exchange control and other rules from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It’s also complex to correctly calculate, pay, and manage accounting for monthly payroll and taxes. All of this made India an unusually complicated market to navigate, and most payroll providers, big or small, shied away from this challenge.\n\nBut we saw a massive opportunity to do business in India, so we did the hard work and built a payroll product that allows businesses to pay full-time employees in India. We didn’t just solve for contractor payroll in India and Employer of Record (EOR) arrangements, which we also offer, but also for paying full-time employees under local Indian entities.\n\n4. Decide if you need a local team in your new market\n\nDepending on the market you choose, you may need to build a local team there. If you have a small SaaS startup and the majority of your sales come from growth marketing, you might be able to get away with running your operations from home.\n\nBut if you’re selling to larger enterprises, being near them in the local market is crucial to your success. You’ll likely need a local go-to-market team that speaks the language, can price and position your product strategically, and understands all the competitive nuances of the market.\n\n5. Operate like a global team, not a siloed one\n\nExpanding into new markets involves more than localizing your product and hiring a local team; it requires a cultural shift, too. We had to find a way to keep thousands of global Rippling employees connected to each other.\n\nThis mindset shift needs to come from the top down. Our CEO Parker Conrad launched an internal operation—which we framed as a “global blitz”—where we rallied a team of Rippling leaders to get employees excited about driving globalization. We needed our employees to start thinking about Rippling as a global business and make every decision going forward with that lens in mind. We also needed everyone to understand how serious going global is and the weight of getting it right; once you decide to go global and start landing in new markets, you can’t easily take it back.\n\nOur Dublin, Ireland office (Rippling’s EMEA HQ), for example, started with just two people and has grown to 125 over the last year and a half. From the get-go, we not only hired local talent but also brought over experienced Rippling employees from our US HQ. I personally moved to Dublin for over a year with my family, joined by our VP of Sales and a few go-to-market leads. This decision to populate the Dublin office with people who knew Rippling inside and out helped us maintain a cohesive culture and employee experience across borders. It also helped new local hires ramp up more quickly, learn about the product, and understand how to tell our unique story.\n\nReady to take your company global?\n\nExpanding into new markets is exciting, but it’s also one of the most daunting things you can do as a business with a lot of potential pitfalls.\n\nAs a startup, you need to test new markets and get things off the ground quickly. But for long-term global success, you need systems in place that will support this rapid growth as you double down on investments into new markets. You may not need every tool in Rippling’s suite of HR, payroll, spend, and IT products now, but in the future, you will. And when the time comes, ripping and replacing your systems will create messy, unusable data and a logistical nightmare.\n\nRippling has taken all the painful learnings from our own global expansion and poured that knowledge into our products. Now, we’re helping other companies take their first steps into international markets. With Rippling, you can onboard global employees in minutes, pay them accurately and on time, and automate compliance with complicated foreign labor and tax laws.\n\nSo join Rippling and come on in, the international waters are nice and warm!",
      "# [16 Tax Deductions for Independent Contractors [2024] by The Rippling Team on 2024-07-23](https://www.rippling.com/blog/independent-contractor-tax-deductions)\nSelf-employed workers typically use their own equipment, find their own office space, and make their own retirement contributions. This all takes time. And costs money.\n\nThe good news is that if you're an independent contractor, sole proprietor, or another form of self-employed worker, many of your business expenses are tax-deductible.\n\nThese deductions, also known as write-offs, are subtracted from your taxable income, which lowers your tax bill. While a deduction won't provide a dollar-for-dollar refund for an expense, it’ll likely lessen the amount you owe to the IRS.\n\nIt pays for self-employed workers in the US to know what is and isn't tax-deductible. While you should consult a certified public accountant (CPA), attorney, or another tax professional to get a comprehensive view of which expenses qualify, consider this your starter guide, complete with common self-employed tax deductions to keep in mind and strategies for recording them.\n\n16 independent contractor tax deductions\n\nBelow, you'll find some of the most common 1099 tax deductions for self-employed workers, along with where to claim the expenses on your tax forms. This list is not exhaustive, and the exact provisions are constantly changing, so you should consult tax professionals and check the IRS' Self-Employed Individuals Tax Center for more information.\n\n1. Self-employment tax deduction\n\nContractors can deduct half of the self-employment tax from their net income. Since you're your own boss when you're self-employed, the IRS allows you to treat this tax as a business expense.\n\nPaperwork: Fill out a Schedule SE, then record half of the tax determined on Line 15 of your Schedule 1.\n\n2. Home office deduction\n\nIf you work from home, you can deduct some of your housing costs from your taxes. This includes:\n\nRent\n\nMortgage interest\n\nHome depreciation\n\nUtilities\n\nHomeowners insurance\n\nMaintenance and repairs\n\nSuppose you rent (rather than own) your home office space and quality for the home office deduction. In that case, you can deduct a percentage of your monthly rent equal to the percentage of your home’s square footage regularly and exclusively used for work. If your home office takes up 15% of your home, you can also deduct 15% of your annual utilities, like electricity.\n\nAdditional office-related expenses you can deduct include office supplies and furniture. If you maintain an office outside your home, incidental maintenance costs and a portion of utilities may also be tax deductible.\n\nPaperwork: The standard way to deduct your home office expenses is by filling out IRS Form 8829. Additionally, you can record home office expenses on Line 30 of your Schedule C. Record deductions for additional office-related expenses between lines 18 and 27 on your Schedule C.\n\n3. Cell phone and internet bills\n\nYou can write off the parts of your phone and internet expenses you use for your business. For example, you can write off any extra costs of long-distance business calls. You can also deduct the entire cost of a second phone line so long as it's exclusively dedicated to your business.\n\nWriting off internet use is similar. You can deduct costs associated with hosting a business website but not bills for personal internet use. Once you delineate which portions of your phone and internet bills are for business and which are personal, you can fully deduct the former.\n\nPaperwork: Business-related cell phone expenses go in Part V of your Schedule C. Internet expenses go in the utilities section on Line 25.\n\n4. Insurance\n\nHealth insurance. You can deduct your health, dental, and long-term care premiums so long as you're not qualified for a plan through your spouse's employer. If you have a spouse, children, or dependents age 26 or younger, you can also deduct health insurance premiums you paid on their behalf.\n\nBusiness insurance. You can deduct premiums for fire insurance, credit insurance, business liability insurance, and car insurance (if the vehicle is used for business).\n\nPaperwork: Health insurance costs go on Line 17 of your Schedule 1, and business insurance costs go on Line 15 of your Schedule C.\n\n5. Travel expenses\n\nYou can deduct travel-related expenses from your taxes if you have a specific, business-related purpose for your trip, which has to be outside of the general area of your home. This includes costs of:\n\nPlane, train, or bus tickets\n\nTaxis and rideshares during your trip\n\nBaggage fees (including shipping)\n\nCar expenses on your trip, including rentals, tolls, and parking fees\n\nLodging\n\nWhile you don't always have to pick the cheapest travel options, you should stay away from writing off any lavish expenses (e.g., booking a first-class flight) for your business trip.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 24.\n\n6. Advertising\n\nAny cost you put up to advertise your business is tax-deductible. This includes:\n\nOnline ads (like Facebook or Google)\n\nTV commercials\n\nRadio spots\n\nMail fliers\n\nBillboards\n\nThis also includes deducting fees from any PR or advertising agencies. You can also write off ads that encourage charitable giving that have your company's name on them.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 8.\n\n7. Meals\n\nYou can also write off half the cost of any meals from business-related travel. Other eligible meals include:\n\nLunch or dinner with clients\n\nFood from a business conference\n\nCatering for promotional events\n\nYou can deduct 50% of the actual cost of the meal with a receipt or take the standard meal allowance—which is pegged to the per diem for federal workers.\n\nPaperwork: Record your meals under travel expenses on Line 24 of your Schedule C.\n\n8. Vehicle expenses\n\nIndependent contractors can claim tax deductions for car expenses when they use the vehicle for business-related reasons, like driving to meet a new client or attending a seminar. Commuting to and from work is never tax-deductible.\n\nThe IRS sets a new standard mileage rate every year that you can record to figure out your deduction. In 2024, the rate is $0.67 cents per mile.\n\nWhile it's slightly more complicated, you can also figure out the percentage portion of business-related driving you did in the past year and multiply it by your car's operating expenses. For example, if you spend $4,000 on maintaining a car you used for work 20% of the time, you could write off $800. That said, there are significant record-keeping requirements for this deduction that you can learn more about here.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 9.\n\n9. Interest expenses\n\nYou can also write off any interest incurred from business loans, like business credit cards, equipment loans, and business lines of credit. If you take out a loan for business and personal reasons, you're only eligible for a deduction for the business portion. So keep careful track of where those funds are going.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that these deductions won't pay off all of your business-related interest. It's always better to pay debts off in full yourself as soon as you can instead of relying on write-offs.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 16.\n\n10. Dues and publications\n\nSelf-employed contractors can also deduct costs from trade magazines and journals directly related to their business—e.g., Graphic Arts Monthly if you're a web designer.\n\nYou can also deduct fees for belonging to groups related to your business, so long as they're not recreational (e.g., no country clubs). According to the IRS, these can include:\n\nBusiness leagues\n\nChambers of commerce\n\nCivic or public service organizations\n\nProfessional organizations (such as bar associations and medical associations)\n\nReal estate boards\n\nTrade associations\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Part V.\n\n11. Education expenses\n\nAny education related to your field of business is tax-deductible. You can claim credit on tuition expenses and get comped for webinars, online courses, and textbooks. But you can't write off any education expenses if you're pursuing a new career path separate from your current line of work.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Part V.\n\n12. Retirement plan contributions\n\nIf you're a self-employed small business owner, contributions to certain employee retirement accounts are tax-deductible. These include:\n\n401(k)s\n\nSimplified employee pension individual retirement accounts (SEP-IRAs)\n\nSavings incentive match plan for employees (SIMPLE) IRAs\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 19.\n\n13. Business licenses and taxes\n\nIf your business requires any special certifications (a real estate license, for instance), you can write off any associated fees on your tax return. The same goes for any regulatory taxes specific to your business.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 23.\n\n14. Business startup costs\n\nIn your first year of a new business, you can claim up to $5,000 in startup cost tax deductions from your taxes. This can apply to things like market research, location scouting, and attorney fees. You can also write off filing fees associated with setting up an LLC.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Part V.\n\n15. Equipment depreciation\n\nYou can deduct the cost of the wear and tear of your work tools as they age. The IRS requires that the eligible property be:\n\nSomething you own\n\nUsed for your business\n\nGoing to become obsolete\n\nExpected to last more than a year\n\nThe easiest way to calculate depreciation is by subtracting the equipment's expected value at the end of its life from its original cost while also determining how long you plan to use the equipment. There are other methods, and if you don't have expert accounting chops, you may want to seek the help of a professional.\n\nPaperwork: Line 13 of your Schedule C.\n\n16. Legal, accounting, and tax services\n\nTo keep track of all potential tax deductions from your business (and avoid any of the pitfalls), you should strongly consider soliciting help from CPAs, attorneys, or other tax professionals. These expenses are also tax-deductible.\n\nPaperwork: Schedule C, Line 17.\n\n4 Tips for self-employed tax deductions\n\nThere are scores of tax write-offs that independent contractors and other self-employed workers can take advantage of. But if not done correctly, you run the risk of an IRS audit. So, before you make any big spending decisions banking on a tax deduction, here are some important guidelines to bear in mind.\n\nSeparate business and personal\n\nThe best way to improve your bookkeeping: clearly delineating business expenses from personal ones. Those lines are often blurred when you're self-employed.\n\nTax deductions are only for business expenses. You can't write off the cost of your bed because you messaged a client from it. The more you draw a clear line, the easier time you'll have claiming deductions. A simple way to do this is to have credit cards and bank accounts that are solely for your business.\n\nKeep great records\n\nProper bookkeeping makes deductions infinitely easier to claim come tax day—it's also your first line of defense in case of an audit. This means keeping and organizing receipts for anything you consider to be a business expense required to perform your line of work.\n\nSome deductions benefit from even more detailed record-keeping. For instance, if you're driving for business, you should record the date, mileage, and purpose of every trip. If you work out of a home office, you should have the dimensions of the workspace to calculate how much you write off.\n\n\"Is this an ordinary and necessary business expense?\"\n\nThis is the question you should always ask yourself before expecting a tax write-off—if the answer is yes, you can often claim a deduction. There are exceptions, such as capital expenses and the cost of goods sold. If the answer is no, the expense is likely non-deductible.\n\nAccording to the IRS: \"An ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in your industry. A necessary expense is one that is helpful and appropriate for your trade or business.\"\n\nThis means you shouldn't deduct any expenses outside your line of work. It also means that while you don't have to pick the cheapest possible options to claim a deduction (a motel stay on a business trip), you shouldn't pick any luxurious options (a five-star resort) either, as these will draw IRS scrutiny.\n\nPaperwork and deadlines\n\nIf you've made over $600 from a client, they'll send you a Form 1099-NEC by the end of January. This form will help you establish your gross income.\n\nSelf-employed workers use their own equipment, find their own office space, and make their own retirement contributions. It all takes time. And costs money.\n\nThe good news is that if you're an independent contractor, sole proprietor, or another form of self-employed worker, many of your business expenses are tax-deductible.\n\nThese deductions, also known as write-offs, are subtracted from your taxable income, which lowers your tax bill. While a deduction won't provide a dollar-for-dollar refund for an expense, it’ll likely lessen the amount you owe to the IRS.\n\nIt pays for self-employed workers in the US to know what is and isn't tax-deductible. While you should consult a certified public accountant (CPA), attorney, or another tax professional to get a comprehensive view of which expenses qualify, consider this your starter guide, complete with common write-offs to keep in mind and strategies for recording them.\n\nThe best way to send tax documents (and payments) to contractors\n\nContractors already face uphill battles filing their own quarterly taxes and documenting their own expenses for write-offs. The task is even trickier when clients are slow to send out 1099s and other forms that help them determine their taxable income.",
      "# [Rippling’s Parker Conrad on the company's new round, new SF lease and, also, its newest critic by Connie Loizos on 2024-04-22](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/ripplings-parker-conrad-on-the-companys-brand-new-round-its-brand-new-sf-lease-and-also-its-brand-new-critic/)\nLast week, TechCrunch broke the news that the workforce management software outfit Rippling was on the cusp of closing a new, $200 million round of funding at a hefty $13.4 billion valuation led by Coatue. We also reported that the round featured a separate, $670 million secondary component meant to give some of the company’s investors a bigger bite of the company, while letting Rippling’s employees — some of whom joined at the outset in 2016 — cash out some of their shares.\n\nRippling declined to comment at the time, but in an interview Friday afternoon, founder Parker Conrad confirmed our information, adding that the secondary component is actually a $590 million tender, with $200 million available for employees and $390 million available for seed and other investors.\n\nThe round, Rippling’s Series F, is also almost entirely an inside round. Coatue is an earlier investor in Rippling, along with other backers in this round that have been investing all along, including Founders Fund and Greenoaks. The only new member on the cap table is Dragoneer, a growth-stage investment firm in San Francisco.\n\nOf course, we were interested in much more than Rippling’s new fundraise, so while we had Conrad on the phone, we talked turnover. We discussed the company’s new office lease in San Francisco (right now, it’s the second-biggest lease to be signed this year in the city). Conrad also shared why Rippling is relatively “free” of AI. You can hear that full conversation in podcast form; if you prefer to read it, excerpts of that conversation follow, edited for length.\n\nSo why raise this money?\n\nHonestly, it started out as just an employee tender. We wanted to find a way to get some liquidity for early employees, so we went to market, looking really to do about $200 million for employees that wanted to sell some stock. [But] we got a lot of investor interest, so we expanded it first to include a small amount of primary [capital] — mostly as a way to get more ownership for investors that were looking to buy more — and then beyond that, we ended up expanding into seed investors as well.\n\nWhat does this secondary sale say about your plans to eventually go public? An IPO is a little bit in the distance?\n\nI definitely think it’s a bit in the distance, but it’s not like a way of delaying [anything]. If anything, it’s probably nice if there are people who want to buy a house or [want more cash] because life happens. It’s great to relieve some of that pressure before you go public so that you don’t have tons of people selling as soon as they can in the public markets.\n\nIs this the first time employees have been able to sell some shares?\n\nIt’s not. We did something in 2021. But it was smaller and the company was smaller, and it was a long time ago.\n\nDo you worry about employees leaving after cashing out?\n\nOne of the things that we talked about internally when we launched it was, we said, ‘Look, the first rule of an employee tender is that you don’t talk about the tender internally or publicly.’ We don’t want to see anyone spiking the football, or something like that. And the second rule of the employee tender is, ‘see the first rule.’ This is a very private, personal thing, and I’m thrilled for everyone [participating]; if this makes a difference in [their] life, that’s great. But it’s not the destination. The game’s not over.\n\nHow do you feel about turnover more generally? Some people don’t like to see it; other managers think it’s for the best. Elon Musk seems to be a fan, given the rate at which he turns over his executive team at Tesla.\n\nThe executive team at Rippling has been remarkably stable for a long time. A lot of the people on the team are people who I originally hired for those roles. Some of them are people I have long work histories with, even before this company. And certainly I always like to keep people. I mean, every once in a while, there’s an early Rippling employee who leaves the company, and I find it always just emotionally really sad when that happens, even if the company is going to be fine and they want to do something else or, you know, in some cases just kind of hang out. On a personal level, that’s always very difficult for me.\n\nYou newly leased 123,000 square feet in San Francisco for local employees, who are now back three days a week. How did you settle on that policy, and do you worry about retention or hiring?\n\nWe just think there’s an enormous amount of value of people being in the office together. We were never a company that was going remote. When we went remote temporarily during the pandemic, we said, this is for three weeks, and then we’re going back to the office. Of course, it was unfortunately a lot longer than that, but we were back in the office as soon as we could be. I think it’s possible for some companies to be fully remote, but it’s sort of like playing the game on hard mode. I think it’s a lot easier if people can get together in person; you get a lot done.\n\nIn the meantime, workforce management software is super crowded. You’re going up against a company that you famously co-founded and ran, Zenefits. There’s Paycor, Workday, Gusto, to name a few . . .\n\nThe weird thing is that Rippling is not actually a [human capital management] HCM company. Everyone who has been building business software believes that the way to build the best business software is to build these extremely narrow, focused deep products. And I think it’s completely wrong. I think the way you build the best business software is to build a really broad product suite of deeply integrated and seamlessly interoperable products. Yes, we have a very strong HR and payroll suite, but we also have an IT and security suite; we have a spend management suite, where we do things like corporate cards and bill pay and expense reimbursements. Actually, we’re using the primary capital that we raised in this round to fund the R&D efforts for a new, fourth cloud that we intend to launch in a completely different area.\n\nThe classic example of a company that builds software in this way is Microsoft. Microsoft is like the OG of compound software businesses.\n\nSpeaking of Microsoft, what is your “AI strategy”?\n\nWe are a company that is relatively free of any AI products right now. There’s some stuff that we’re working on. But I am always very skeptical of things that are, like, super trendy in Silicon Valley. So I can tell you what [our AI strategy] is not. I’m super skeptical of these chatbots. I don’t think anyone wants to chat with their HR software.\n\nI have to ask about a tweet related to our story about your new round. I saw [Benchmark general partner] Bill Gurley chimed in that “Anti-focus ain’t cheap.” I wasn’t sure if that was laudatory or a dig. Do you know?\n\nI assume given that it came from Bill that it’s a dig. And he’s not wrong that taking this opposite approach is expensive, particularly on the R&D side. If you look at Rippling financially, the thing that really stands out is how we spend on R&D. If you compare us to other HCM competitors — because you talked about the crowded HCM space — they spend an average of 10% of their revenue on R&D. Next year, Rippling is going to spend as much on R&D as [three rival companies] combined, and we have a much lower revenue footprint than the three. It’s definitely true that there’s a huge upfront investment phase in building what we’re building that obviously over time, as a percent of revenue, should come down. So he’s not wrong, but it’s a very explicit part of our strategy. What Bill might not totally understand is the benefit that you get from building software in this way; much higher upfront R&D costs [later result in] much higher sales and marketing efficiency.\n\nHas Bill ever done business with you?\n\nNo, I’ve never met Bill. He’s sort of a constant, low-grade antagonist, but I’ve never actually met him.\n\nI know he doesn’t get along very well with Marc Andreessen.\n\nThen Bill and I have that in common. Maybe we should meet up and grab a beer over that particular thing.",

Finance departments using Rippling reported needing 40% fewer staff to execute the same activities, simplifying management as companies grow.\n\n“Unlike existing corporate cards in Canada, the Rippling corporate card integrates a company’s employee records, enabling real-time spending monitoring and control, payroll linking, and custom analytics. Our deep platform automations enhance efficiency and cost savings. Other corporate cards don’t have the access to employee records to be able to do that,” explains Rippling COO Matt MacInnis. “This system automates spend oversight, ensures policy compliance, eliminates unauthorized spending and manual tracking, empowering smarter financial decisions and saving money.”",
