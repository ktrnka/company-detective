Enter data once and the system propagates changes everywhere. Say goodbye to clunky bulk uploads, manual data entry, hand-calculated prorations, and last-minute client changes.\n\nPerfect payroll transparency\n\nFix client mistakes before they snowball. Fully configurable payroll reports give you the insight to answer any questions about current or past pay runs. Need more detail? Jump straight to an employee’s record to audit their pay, time, or benefits history.\n\nSet-it-and-forget-it T&A and accounting integrations\n\nSync payroll data to a client’s general ledger in the exact format you need, including details like class and job code. Avoid manual manipulation in every monthly close. Integrations with Quickbooks Online, NetSuite, Sage Intacct, and Xero run themselves after easy setup. If your clients choose not to use Rippling Time & Attendance to track time, we also integrate with other time tools, like QuickBooks Time and Deputy.\n\nNever manually enter pay rates again\n\nHardcoded time splits are allocated to employee wages before you ever get the time sheet. Skip the pivot tables or exports to manually split and calculate employee hours. Instead, Rippling auto-calculates pay rates for you.\n\nPayroll that can handle the unique complexities of each client\n\nWith Rippling, there’s no need to trade ease of use for the ability to handle complex client needs. For clients with hourly workers, use custom job dimensions to auto-adjust pay rates by job function, even within a single shift. Or, if employees work in multiple states in a single pay period, Rippling can auto-calculate tax rates by store location.\n\nCustom job codes take the grunt work out of job costing\n\nFor clients with project-based work—like construction companies, professional services organizations, and non-profits—use custom job dimensions to track hours and headcount spend on each project.

Plus, Rippling’s app store gives clients access to exclusive discounts on third-party software like Zoom and Expensify.\n\nReal resolutions in real time\n\nIf you have an urgent client issue, don’t spend hours on hold only to get an unsatisfactory non-answer.

Everybody at Rippling deeply believes in what we’re building. It’s common for somebody to notice a problem outside their purview and take the initiative to solve it.

That’s kind of our thing.\n\nCommitted to growth\n\nWe’ve always known that Rippling could be big. At times the challenge of building something ambitious has surprised us.

We’ll continue to hire people in time zones across the globe, because we want to collaborate with the very best. But we’ll also continue to listen and improve, wherever necessary. Growth is a two-way street.\n\nWork-life flexible\n\nThe amount of work ahead means Rippling won’t always be a 9-to-5. But our employees’ lives are like jigsaw puzzles.

      "# [Highnoon uses Rippling to onboard employees 10x faster](https://www.rippling.com/customers/highnoon)\nHighnoon is a full-service marketing, advertising, consulting, and technology agency that helps medium to large organizations “turn their bold visions into reality.” As the agency’s Managing Partner, Scott Kaufmann sets the vision for the company and oversees daily operations.\n\n“Rippling helps minimize the administrative work on the HR and IT side, which means I can spend more time on what I enjoy most: helping clients solve problems with innovative strategies,” he explains.\n\nAutomating HR operations and technology management\n\nAt his previous agency, Scott used a combination of Zenefits for people operations and Quickbooks Payroll for payroll. Prior to starting Highnoon, he knew he wanted to stick with a platform that could automate the HR portion. Scott evaluated a few competitors, like BambooHR, but it became clear that they were missing crucial portions of what Highnoon needed, like the ability to integrate with their 401(k) and time tracking software. Scott ended up choosing Rippling for Highnoon because he was excited by the platform’s ability not only to automate HR operations, but also to handle the IT side with app and device management. “At my previous agency, we had an issue where our people operations were automated, but our technology systems weren’t,” he said. “Rippling would finally be able to solve that for us.” Implementing Rippling was seamless and took about two months. Highnoon decided to take their time with the implementation; they knew they needed payroll and benefits on day one, but everything else could come later. “We actually ended up getting much more than that on the first day of work. We were able to connect several different systems into Rippling, including our office suite and project minutes, which was great,” Scott told us.\n\nAn all-in-one system that feels like\n\nan enterprise product\n\n“With Rippling’s added layer of technology management, the platform is able to harmonize both the HR and the IT side. Rippling has also continued to mature and add new features over time; it’s an all-in-one system that feels like an enterprise product,” said Scott. “Our employees are already used to seamless and intuitive experiences in their consumer technology—so we’re happy we can match that standard with Rippling’s modern payroll and benefits platform.”\n\nScott Kaufmann\n\nOther highlights include:\n\n50% time savings with identity and device management:\n\n“By automating the technology management side, Rippling has saved us 50% more time compared to what we used at my previous agency. I love that we can provision devices with cascading permissions based on role, in addition to things like device ID tracking and managing SSO for all our different apps.\n\n10x faster employee onboarding:\n\n“At our previous company, provisioning employee devices with access was a heavy administrative burden and could take five hours. With Rippling, it takes 30 minutes at most.”\n\nIntuitive, easy-to-use payroll:\n\n“Rippling is more intuitive and easier to use than other payroll providers I’ve used, like ADP. I also appreciate their thoughtful touches that improve the employee experience, including providing digital copies of W-2s inside the Rippling portal, making them much easier to keep track of and easier for employees to access.”\n\nImproved benefits management process:\n\n“Rippling gives our employees a clear understanding of how much different insurance plans will cost, making it easy for them to be informed about which benefits to choose.”\n\n400+ integrations to help automate admin work:\n\n“It’s great that Rippling integrates with so many of our existing systems, including Cylance, a security suite that helps prevent malware and viruses.”\n\nDifferent levels of access so everyone can take care of what they need to:\n\n“Rippling provides us with just the right amount of granularity in terms of access for all of our different users. For example, we have a people ops manager and health insurance broker as admins with different levels of permissions, in addition to department leads who can manage the people processes and approvals for their teams autonomously.”",

      "# [What Is a 401(k)?](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/401k)\n401(k) vs. other investment accounts\n\nIf you’re planning for retirement, you’re probably wondering how a 401(k) compares to other investment options. The 401(k) offers unique tax advantages, particularly in how contributions and earnings are treated, which might make it a more attractive option than other accounts depending on your financial goals.\n\n401(k) vs. pension\n\nPension: A retirement plan typically funded and managed by an employer, where the employee receives a fixed monthly benefit upon retirement. The amount is usually based on salary and years of service.\n\n401(k): A defined contribution plan, meaning the employee (and sometimes the employer) contributes money into the account, but the retirement benefits depend on the investment options chosen and the account's performance.\n\nPensions provide guaranteed income. On the other hand, 401(k)s offer more flexibility and potential growth, but also come with investment risks.\n\n401(k) vs. IRA\n\nBoth 401(k)s and IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts) are tax-advantaged retirement accounts, but they differ in contribution limits, tax treatment, and eligibility.\n\nA 401(k) is typically employer-sponsored, allows higher contribution limits, and often includes employer matching contributions.\n\nAn IRA, which can be a traditional or Roth IRA, is opened independently by the individual, offering more investment options but lower contribution limits. A Roth IRA, specifically, offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, unlike a traditional 401(k), where withdrawals are taxed. The choice between a 401(k) and an IRA often depends on whether the account holder needs higher contribution limits or wants employer contributions.\n\n401(k) vs. brokerage account\n\nA brokerage account is a taxable account where you can buy and sell a wide range of investments, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Unlike a 401(k), contributions to a brokerage account are not tax-advantaged, meaning you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains each year. However, brokerage accounts offer more flexibility in terms of investment options and access to funds, making them useful for short- to medium-term financial goals, while a 401(k) is typically more suited for long-term retirement savings due to its tax benefits and penalties for early withdrawal.\n\nWho is a 401(k) for?\n\nA 401(k) is designed for employees in America who want to save for retirement while taking advantage of tax benefits. It is particularly beneficial for those whose employers offer matching contributions, as this essentially provides free money toward retirement savings.\n\nThe 401(k) is suitable for individuals who are willing to invest their contributions in a range of funds, understanding that their retirement income will depend on how their investments perform.\n\nPros and cons of a 401(k)\n\nHow does a 401(k) work?\n\nNow that you know what a 401(k) is, how does it work?\n\nA 401(k) is a retirement savings plan that allows employees to contribute a portion of their salary into a tax-advantaged account, often with matching employer contributions. This type of plan is known as a defined contribution plan, meaning that the retirement benefits are based on the amount contributed and the performance of the investments chosen.\n\nAmericans use 401(k) plans as a primary method for building retirement savings, typically through employer-sponsored programs. Depending on the type of plan, employee contributions can be made on a pre-tax basis, meaning they reduce the employee’s taxable income for the year. The contributions then grow tax-deferred, with taxes paid only upon withdrawal in retirement.\n\nEmployer contributions to your 401(k) may be subject to a vesting schedule, meaning you need to remain employed with the company for a certain period before you fully own those contributions.\n\nWhat is a traditional 401(k)?\n\nA traditional 401(k) is a type of retirement savings account where contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your current taxable income. The funds grow tax-deferred, and you pay income tax on withdrawals during retirement.\n\nPlan contribution limits: For 2024, the annual contribution limit is $23,000 for individuals under 50. Those 50 and older can make an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500, for a total annual contribution of $30,500.\n\nEmployer matching: Cannot exceed the lesser of $69,000 for individuals under 50 (pr $76,500 for those 50 and up) or 100% of the employee’s annual compensation.\n\nRequired minimum distributions (RMDs): Once you reach age 73, you are required to start taking minimum distributions from your traditional 401(k) each year. The amount is calculated based on your life expectancy.\n\nPros and cons of a traditional 401(k)\n\nWhat is a Roth 401(k)?\n\nA Roth 401(k) is similar to a traditional 401(k) but with a key difference in tax treatment. Contributions to a Roth 401(k) are made with after-tax dollars, meaning they do not reduce your current taxable income. However, withdrawals during retirement are tax-free, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nPlan contribution limits: For 2024, the annual contribution limit is $23,000 for individuals under 50. Those 50 and older can make an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500, for a total annual contribution of $30,500.\n\nEmployer matching: Cannot exceed the lesser of $69,000 for individuals under 50 (pr $76,500 for those 50 and up) or 100% of the employee’s annual compensation.\n\nRequired minimum distributions (RMDs): None.\n\nPros and cons of a Roth 401(k)\n\nHow do you start a 401(k)?\n\nIndividuals generally can’t start a 401(k) on their own—you need to enroll in your employer’s retirement plan during the onboarding process or an open enrollment period. Eligibility requirements vary by employer, but most plans allow employees to begin contributing once they have met certain employment criteria, such as a specific length of service.\n\nTo enroll, you’ll need to fill out the necessary forms provided by your employer, choose your contribution rate, and select your investment options from those offered within the plan.\n\nHow does a 401(k) earn money?\n\nA 401(k) earns money through the growth of the investments chosen by the plan participants.\n\nThese can include:\n\nMutual funds\n\nTarget date funds\n\nStocks\n\nBonds\n\nOther securities\n\nThe account balance grows over time as the account investments generate returns, such as dividends or capital gains. The specific investment strategy you choose, based on your risk tolerance and retirement goals, will influence how much your 401(k) earns. Diversified investments can help manage risk and maximize growth potential over the long term.\n\nHow and when do you withdraw from a 401(k)?\n\nWithdrawals from a 401(k) are, as a rule, only allowed once the account owner reaches age 59½, though plan participants may take early withdrawals under certain conditions—often with penalties.\n\nQualified distributions from traditional 401(k) accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified distributions from Roth accounts are tax-free.\n\nAll IRS rules about 401(k) distributions (and their tax treatment) can be found in Publication 575, Pension and Annuity Income.\n\nFrequently asked questions about 401(k)s\n\nStill have questions about 401(k)s? Learn more in the FAQs below.\n\nCan you take early withdrawals from a 401(k)?\n\nYou can take early withdrawals from a 401(k), but it’s important to understand the potential penalties and tax implications. Generally, withdrawing funds before age 59½ will result in a 10% early withdrawal penalty in addition to the regular income tax on the withdrawn amount. However, there are exceptions for specific circumstances, such as a hardship withdrawal, which may allow you to avoid the penalty but still require you to pay income taxes on the amount. Consulting with a financial advisor before taking an early withdrawal can help you understand your options and minimize financial consequences.\n\nWhat happens to your 401(k) if you leave your job?\n\nIf you leave your job, you have several options for your 401(k). You can leave the funds in your former employer’s plan, if allowed, or you can roll over the balance into a new employer’s 401(k) plan or an IRA. Rolling over your 401(k) can help you consolidate your retirement savings and maintain control over your investments, but it’s important to handle the rollover process correctly to avoid taxes and penalties.\n\nAre 401(k)s taxed?\n\nIf you have a traditional 401(k), you make pre-tax contributions, allowing your investments to grow until you withdraw them in retirement (also known as tax deferral). Upon withdrawal, the funds are taxed as ordinary income.\n\nIf you have a Roth 401(k), contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so withdrawals during retirement are tax-free, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nWhat is a solo 401(k)?\n\nA Solo 401(k) is a retirement savings plan designed for self-employed individuals or small business owners with no full-time employees other than the business owner and their spouse. This plan allows for higher contribution limits than traditional 401(k) plans because the business owner can contribute both as an employer and an employee. A Solo 401(k) can be an excellent option for small business owners looking to maximize their retirement savings.",
      "# [Sierra uses Rippling to Deliver an Employee Experience as Delightful as Their Customer Experience](https://www.rippling.com/customers/sierra)\nAs a leading platform of conversational AI agents, Sierra helps businesses “elevate [their] customer experience.” And this dedication to providing swift, reliable, and empathetic help extends to the company’s own workforce.\n\n“I think of our employees as my customers,” said Natasha Clare, Sierra’s Head of Operations. “We want everyone that joins Sierra to feel like they had a high touch onboarding experience.” While this was easy enough when Natasha joined the recently formed company in May 2023, Sierra grew tenfold within a year and expects continued, fast-paced hiring in the months ahead.\n\nNatasha and Business Ops team member Nittai Malchin handle onboarding, compliance, benefits, payroll, and countless other People tasks for Sierra’s workforce. They want to maintain a high level of employee support as Sierra aims to hit its ambitious growth goals. There is no room for slow and clunky processes across a patchwork of different software systems.\n\nSierra joined Rippling PEO and united HR functions across payroll, onboarding, compliance, and benefits administration alongside device and expense management support.\n\nNow, Sierra’s administrators can hire, manage, and pay its growing workforce efficiently. And employees get a comprehensive HR experience that sets them up for success.\n\nWe couldn’t function without Rippling.\n\nBret Taylor\n\nCEO of Sierra, Chairman of OpenAI, Former CEO of Salesforce\n\n01\n\nA better employee experience\n\nRippling allows Natasha to deliver on her goal of providing a premium onboarding process for every new team member, even as Sierra quickly scales. “It’s a really streamlined, centralized experience for employees,” Natasha said. “Our employees appreciate having one centralized location for healthcare enrollment, payroll, and employee information. It really is a one-stop shop.”\n\nShe also said employees find Rippling’s Expense Management feature easy to use, since their direct deposit information is already in the system and linked to payroll, which allows the team to get quickly reimbursed for business purchases.\n\nAccording to Clay Bavor, Sierra’s co-founder, Rippling’s ease-of-use helps the company promote its culture. “One of our company values is craftsmanship,” he said. “While we think of that through the lens of what our product looks like, it applies to all of our operations, including the tools we use and vendors we partner with. We really care about what we put in front of our teams and we love the look and feel of Rippling.”\n\n02\n\nAll-in-one workforce management\n\nInstead of cobbling together different point solutions for different processes, “our entire HR function is run on Rippling,” Natasha said. She uses Rippling for every step of the onboarding process, including distributing and storing tax documents and confidentiality agreements, setting new hires up for payroll, enrolling them in healthcare and 401(k) plans, and running background checks.\n\n“There’s no other platform that we use that’s central in the same way,” Natasha said. “Rippling is our one HR platform that every single employee uses.”\n\nIn addition to unifying HR systems, Sierra takes even further advantage of Rippling’s all-in-one platform by unifying employee processes across IT and finance. This includes using Device Management to provision laptops during onboarding and Expense Management to process employee reimbursements.\n\n\"We've been growing fast and Rippling's had no issues keeping pace. It gives every new hire peace of mind so we can focus on supporting our customers,” said Clay.\n\n03\n\nEfficiency gains for admins\n\nThe upshot of having so many systems under the same roof? Automated workflows that yield massive time-savings for Sierra’s HR team.\n\nNatasha appreciates that Rippling serves as a repository for all employee data, which eliminates the need for any manual payroll calculations. And while she used to manually register remote employees for state taxes, Rippling PEO now handles it without her lifting a finger.\n\n“I’m in Rippling every day,” she said. “It’s nice to have a dashboard checklist of things I need to accomplish as an admin. Rippling helps keep me on track.”\n\nAnd Nittai (on Sierra’s Business Ops team) finds Rippling to be a welcome upgrade from Gusto, which he used in prior roles at other companies but had to supplement with other systems (like Kandji for device management and a separate payroll provider for international contractors) to manage and pay his workforce. “We felt the overhead of having separate systems. You’re basically duplicating the same amount of work,” he said. “I’m a fan of being able to centralize.”\n\nRippling provides the two-person ops team “time savings and efficiency,” Natasha said. “I think it’s a really convenient platform.”\n\nOur entire HR function is run on Rippling… There’s no other platform we use that’s central in the same way.\n\nNatasha Clare\n\nHead of Operations at Sierra",
      "# [What Is Payroll?](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/payroll)\nWhat payroll entails\n\nThe key purpose of payroll is to make sure your employees are paid accurately and on time while complying with various legal requirements. More specifically, that means:\n\nCalculating wages\n\nDetermine the correct amount of pay for each employee based on their hours worked, salary, wage, or commission structure. This also includes accounting for overtime, bonuses, and any other compensation.\n\nCalculating and filing taxes\n\nCalculate, withhold, and remit the correct taxes, which can include federal, state, and local taxes, depending on where your business and your employee(s) are located. Employers are required to file payroll taxes with the appropriate agencies and provide employees with the necessary tax documents by the correct deadlines.\n\nCompliance\n\nAdhere to federal, state, and local labor and employment laws, including minimum wage requirements, overtime pay regulations, workers’ compensation enrollment, and proper classification of employees and independent contractors. It’s up to employers to stay up-to-date on these laws and any changes to legislation to avoid potential penalties.\n\nRecordkeeping\n\nMaintain accurate records of employee hours, wages, tax withholdings, and other payroll-related information. These records are important to have on hand for tax filings and in case you get audited or need to resolve any payroll disputes.\n\nRunning payroll: 2 methods\n\nThere are two primary methods for running payroll: manually calculating payroll or using a payroll system. Each method has its own benefits and considerations, which we’ll explore in more detail below.\n\nCalculating payroll manually\n\nCalculating payroll manually involves using spreadsheets or other manual methods to track employee hours, calculate wages, and determine tax withholdings. This method is most often used by small businesses with a limited number of employees.\n\nHow to run payroll manually\n\nGather employee information. Collect necessary payroll information such as hours worked, salary rates, and any bonuses or commissions.\n\nReview and approve time sheets. If your employees are paid hourly and not salaried, review their time sheets and compare them to employee schedules to check for errors.\n\nCalculate gross pay. Multiply the hours worked by the hourly rate, or use the salary amount, adding any bonuses or commissions.\n\nCalculate and withhold income taxes. Calculate income tax withholdings (federal, state, and local, if applicable based on where the employee lives and their allowances. You can use the IRS Withholding Estimator to determine how much to withhold for federal income tax, and check with your employee’s state tax assessor’s office for the correct state income tax withholding rate, if they have a state income tax.\n\nCalculate other deductions. Calculate Social Security taxes, Medicare, federal and state unemployment taxes, and any other payroll deductions (e.g., retirement plan contributions, health insurance).\n\nCalculate net pay. Subtract the total deductions from the gross pay to determine the net pay.\n\nPay employees. Issue payments to employees each payday. You can pay them via paper checks, by direct deposit into their bank accounts, or by whatever payment method you mutually agree upon.\n\nRecordkeeping. Maintain accurate records of all payroll calculations and payments, and give pay stubs to employees for their own records.\n\nUsing a payroll system\n\nA payroll system automates the payroll process, reducing the risk of errors and saving time. Payroll systems can handle calculations, tax filings, direct deposits, and recordkeeping. Some even have time tracking, employee benefits like PTO and sick time, integrations with accounting software, garnishments, and other convenient features that make payroll easier for everyone from startups to small business owners to enterprise companies.\n\nTypes of payroll systems\n\nThere are several different types of payroll systems businesses can choose from, based on their needs and resources.\n\nProfessional payroll services\n\nProfessional payroll services provide full-service solutions for managing payroll, which can be a good choice for businesses that either don’t have a full human resources team, or have limited in-house HR resources.\n\nBy outsourcing payroll to a professional service, businesses can have a complete hands-off experience that includes all aspects of payroll processing: wage calculations, deductions, direct deposits, and generating payroll reports. Additionally, full-service payroll providers often offer HR support, such as managing employee benefits, handling workers' comp, and assisting with compliance, giving your business more flexibility to focus on its core operations.\n\nPayroll software\n\nPayroll software allows businesses to manage payroll in-house using automated tools. These modern payroll solutions can typically handle calculations, tax filings, and direct deposits, giving businesses flexibility and control while saving them time and effort.\n\nHybrid payroll systems\n\nHybrid payroll systems combine elements of both professional services and payroll software. Businesses can use software for routine tasks while relying on professional services for complex issues or compliance support.\n\nHow to choose a payroll system\n\nWhen choosing a payroll system, consider factors such as the size of your business, your budget, the complexity of your payroll needs, and the level of expertise you need to manage your payroll. Carefully evaluate the features, costs, and support options of different systems to find the best fit for your business.\n\nWhat to consider when selecting a payroll system\n\n1. Your business needs\n\nSize of your business: Small businesses might benefit from simple, self-service payroll solutions, while larger organizations may require comprehensive, full-service options.\n\nComplexity of your payroll needs: Consider the complexity of your payroll needs, such as multiple pay rates, bonuses, commissions, and overtime calculations.\n\n2. Payroll providers\n\nReputation and reliability: Research payroll providers and read reviews to make sure they have a good track record of reliability and customer satisfaction.\n\nServices offered: Look for providers that offer the payroll management features you need, like tax filing, compliance, or human resources support.\n\n3. Pricing\n\nCost structure: Understand the pricing model of each payroll provider or software. Some charge a flat fee per month, while others may charge per payroll run or per employee you onboard.\n\nHidden fees: Be aware of any additional costs, such as fees for tax filing, direct deposits, or customer support.\n\n4. Integrations\n\nAccounting software: Does the payroll system integrate with your existing accounting software?\n\nTime tracking systems: If the payroll software doesn’t offer time tracking as a feature, make sure it integrates with a time tracking system to automate the process of calculating hours worked.\n\n5. User experience\n\nIntuitive interface: The payroll system should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for your HR team to navigate and use.\n\nSelf-service options: Self-service features, like an app or employee dashboard, allow employees to access their pay stubs and tax forms, and update personal information without needing HR intervention.\n\n6. Customer support\n\nAvailability: See if the payroll provider offers reliable customer support to assist with any issues or questions that may arise.\n\nResources: Look for additional resources such as training materials, webinars, and tutorials to help your team get the most out of the system.\n\nPayroll taxes\n\nPayroll taxes are the mandatory contributions that employers and employees make to fund various government programs. It’s usually up to employers to deduct them from employees’ paychecks and file and pay them on employees’ behalf. Here’s a breakdown of the different types of payroll taxes you’ll need to know.\n\nFICA taxes\n\nFICA, a type of federal tax, includes Social Security and Medicare. Both employers and employees contribute to these taxes. The current rates are 6.2% for Social Security and 1.45% for Medicare, with employers matching these contributions.\n\nUnemployment taxes\n\nUnemployment taxes fund state and federal unemployment insurance programs. Employers are responsible for paying these taxes, which vary based on the state and the employer's experience rating.\n\nIncome taxes\n\nIncome taxes are withheld from employees' wages and paid to federal, state, and local tax authorities. Employers must accurately calculate and withhold these taxes based on employees' earnings and tax withholdings.\n\nFrequently asked questions about payroll\n\nStill have questions about payroll? Learn more in the FAQs below.\n\nWhat is the difference between gross pay and net pay?\n\nGross pay is the total amount of money earned by an employee before any deductions, such as taxes, health insurance, and retirement contributions. Net pay is the amount of money an employee takes home after all deductions have been subtracted from the gross pay.\n\nHow often should payroll be processed?\n\nPayroll can be processed on various schedules, including weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly. The frequency depends on the employer's policies and the nature of the business. Consistency in payroll runs helps ensure timely payment to employees and compliance with labor laws.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using a payroll service provider?\n\nUsing a payroll service provider can save time and reduce errors by automating payroll calculations, tax filings, and compliance tasks. It also ensures that payroll is processed accurately and on time, helps maintain compliance with labor laws, and provides support for human resources functions.\n\nHow do payroll systems integrate with accounting software?\n\nPayroll systems can integrate with accounting software to streamline financial management. This integration allows for automatic synchronization of payroll data with the company's general ledger, reducing the need for manual data entry and minimizing the risk of errors.\n\nWhy is payroll tax compliance important?\n\nPayroll tax compliance is crucial to avoid legal penalties and fines. Employers must accurately calculate, withhold, and remit federal, state, and local taxes. Compliance with tax regulations ensures that employees receive accurate tax forms and that the business adheres to legal requirements.\n\nWhat are the potential penalties for payroll errors?\n\nPenalties for payroll errors can include fines, interest on unpaid taxes, and legal action. Errors such as incorrect tax withholdings, late tax payments, or misclassification of employees can result in significant financial and legal consequences for the business.",
      "# [Commitment to clients by The Rippling Team on 2024-04-03](https://www.rippling.com/blog/jpmorgan)\nOn March 9, 2023, in response to a regional banking crisis, the FDIC froze the accounts of Silicon Valley Bank, Rippling's then-financial services provider, and the clock was ticking to get clients the money they needed to pay their employees. Without hesitation, Rippling authorized the release of $130 million of the company’s own capital as a stopgap, but there was still the matter of actually issuing the payments. Thankfully Rippling had a contingency plan in place, which included an existing partnership with J.P. Morgan. Together, Rippling and J.P. Morgan established secure payment rails, beat the clock, and paid everyone on time.\n\nThe process of moving money across international borders for payroll and other transactions involves navigating myriad country-specific regulations and banking systems, each with its own unique requirements for currency exchange and tax compliance. This complexity necessitates a banking partner that can provide extensive global coverage and a sophisticated suite of services to handle the intricacies of navigating international payments. In these matters, there is arguably no better partner of choice than J.P. Morgan.\n\nTheir truly exceptional client service solidified Rippling’s confidence in J.P.

      "# [What Is Overtime?](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/overtime)\nWhat are overtime hours?\n\nOvertime hours refer to any hours worked by an employee beyond their standard work schedule. In most cases, this is defined as working more than 40 hours in a single workweek. Some industries or employers might have different thresholds for overtime, such as daily overtime for working more than 8 hours in a day, depending on local labor laws and company policies.\n\nWhat is overtime pay?\n\nOvertime pay is the additional compensation qualifying employees receive for working overtime hours. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is an American law that mandates that non-exempt employees must be paid at least one and a half times their regular hourly rate for any hours worked over 40 in a workweek. This higher rate is commonly referred to as \"time and a half.\"\n\nWho is eligible for overtime pay?\n\nEligibility for overtime pay depends on the employee's classification under overtime laws, most notably the FLSA.\n\nExempt employees\n\nExempt employees are typically not eligible for overtime pay (or minimum wage). These employees fall into categories such as executive, administrative, professional, outside sales, and certain computer employees. To qualify as exempt, these employees must meet specific criteria regarding their job duties and receive a salary that meets or exceeds a certain threshold set by the Department of Labor. The FLSA also doesn’t require agricultural workers to receive overtime pay.\n\nNon-exempt employees\n\nNon-exempt employees are eligible for overtime pay. These employees are usually paid on an hourly basis and do not meet the exemption criteria. Non-exempt employees must receive overtime pay at a rate of at least one and a half times their regular hourly wage for any hours worked over 40 in a workweek.\n\nIndependent contractors\n\nIndependent contractors are not eligible for overtime pay under the FLSA. They are considered self-employed and are typically paid per project or assignment rather than by the hour. As such, they are responsible for negotiating their rates and managing their work hours.\n\nHow to calculate overtime pay\n\nCalculating overtime pay is usually pretty straightforward:\n\nDetermine the employee’s regular rate of pay: Identify the employee's regular hourly wage. For salaried employees, divide their weekly salary by the number of hours they are expected to work per week (typically 40 hours).\n\nCalculate the overtime rate: Multiply the regular hourly rate by 1.5 to find the overtime rate. For example, if the regular hourly rate is $20, the overtime rate would be $20x1.5, or $30.\n\nCalculate how many overtime hours the employee worked: Determine the number of hours of overtime worked. This is the total hours worked in the week minus 40 hours.\n\nCalculate the employee’s overtime pay: Multiply the overtime hours by the overtime rate. For example, if an employee worked 45 hours in a week with a regular hourly rate of $20, the calculation would be:\n\nOvertime hours = 45-40 = 5 hours\n\nOvertime pay = 5 hours x $30 (overtime rate) = $150\n\nCalculate the employee’s total pay: Add the regular pay and the overtime pay. For the example above:\n\nRegular pay = 40 hours x $20 (regular pay rate) = $800\n\nOvertime pay = $150\n\nTotal pay = $800 + $150 = $950\n\nState laws regarding overtime\n\nWhile the FLSA covers all of America, states have made their own laws to increase protections or make more specific rules about who is eligible for overtime pay and when.\n\nCalifornia has the strictest overtime laws, requiring employers to pay double an employee’s regular pay rate if they work more than 12 hours in a day or more than eight hours on their seventh consecutive day of work.\n\nThese states have daily overtime rules:\n\nAlaska: 1.5 times the regular pay rate if an employee works more than eight hours in a day.\n\nCalifornia: 1.5 times the regular pay rate if an employee works more than eight hours in a day.\n\nColorado: 1.5 times the regular pay rate if an employee works more than 12 hours in a day or 12 consecutive hours.\n\nFlorida: Overtime pay is required for manual laborers who work more than 10 hours in a day.\n\nNevada: 1.5 times the regular pay rate if an employee works more than eight hours in a day and earns less than 1.5 times the minimum wage.\n\nOregon: 1.5 times the regular pay rate if an employee works more than 10 hours a day in mill, factory, or manufacturing jobs, or eight hours a day in timber jobs.\n\nFrequently asked questions about overtime\n\nWhat counts as overtime hours?\n\nOvertime hours typically refer to any hours worked beyond the standard 40-hour workweek. However, some states or employers may have different thresholds, such as requiring overtime pay for hours worked over 8 in a single day. It’s important to check local labor laws and company policies for specific definitions of overtime hours.\n\nAre salaried employees eligible for overtime pay?\n\nNot all salaried employees are exempt from overtime. Eligibility depends on the specific job duties and salary level. Exempt employees, such as those in executive, administrative, or professional roles, generally don’t qualify for overtime pay.\n\nHow do nondiscretionary bonuses affect overtime pay?\n\nNondiscretionary bonuses are bonuses that are promised or expected as part of an employee’s compensation. These bonuses are included in the calculation of the regular rate of pay, but under the FLSA, they don’t count toward determining overtime pay.\n\nDo part-time employees receive overtime pay?\n\nPart-time employees are entitled to overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours in a workweek. The same rules that apply to full-time employees also apply to part-time employees regarding overtime eligibility and compensation.\n\nWhere can employers and employees learn more about overtime laws?\n\nThe Department of Labor (dol.gov) has multiple fact sheets available about overtime and overtime pay.",

      "# [What Is an Applicant Tracking System (ATS)?](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/ats)\nHow do applicant tracking systems work?\n\nApplicant tracking systems (ATS) are software solutions designed to streamline the recruitment process by helping hiring teams manage and organize candidate information.\n\nApplicant tracking software is typically cloud-based. These platforms allow recruiters and HR professionals to store and track candidate information, like resumes, cover letters, and job applications, in one centralized location. By automating many aspects of the hiring process, an ATS helps companies quickly identify the best candidates and attract top talent in their fields.\n\nThe system works by analyzing resumes and applications, comparing them to job descriptions, and ranking candidates based on how well they meet the criteria for open positions. Talent acquisition teams can then use the ATS to manage candidate communication, schedule interviews, and track each applicant’s progress through the hiring pipeline.\n\nSome ATS systems also generate reports and real-time analytics to help companies optimize their recruitment strategies.\n\nHow do employers use applicant tracking systems to find candidates?\n\nEmployers use applicant tracking systems to streamline the process of finding and hiring the right candidates. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how ATS can be used to recruit new hires:\n\nCreating and posting job listings. Employers start by creating job postings within the ATS. The system makes it easier to distribute job listings across multiple job boards, career sites, and social media platforms like LinkedIn, so they can reach a broader audience and attract a larger pool of candidates.\n\nCollecting applications. As candidates apply, the ATS automatically collects their information. The system then parses resumes and organizes them into candidate profiles, making it easier for hiring managers and human resources teams to review applications.\n\nScreening and assessing candidates. ATS systems often come with tools for initial candidate assessments, which can include keyword searches that match resumes against job requirements, or scoring algorithms that rank candidates based on their qualifications.\n\nManaging communication. Throughout the process, the ATS helps manage communication with candidates. Automated messaging features can be used to send updates, schedule interviews, and keep candidates engaged and informed.\n\nTracking progress. The ATS allows hiring teams to track each candidate's progress through the recruitment pipeline, from the application stage to sending offer letters. The system also facilitates team collaboration by allowing hiring managers and HR to share notes and feedback on each candidate.\n\nOnboarding. Once a candidate is selected, the ATS should, ideally, assist with the onboarding process by making sure you already have a head start on gathering your new hire’s information and documentation.\n\nWhat features should an applicant tracking system have?\n\nWhen selecting an applicant tracking system, look for features that will support and improve every part of your recruitment process. Here are some key features to look for:\n\nHeadcount planning you can sync across your organization\n\nJob description templates you can customize\n\nJob posting across multiple job boards and career sites\n\nEmployee referrals and referral management\n\nResume parsing for efficient candidate screening\n\nCandidate assessments and scoring algorithms\n\nInterview scheduling tools to coordinate with candidates and hiring teams\n\nMessaging for candidate communication\n\nAutomated workflows to eliminate time-consuming administrative work (like re-entering candidate information at different steps)\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) features to optimize candidate matching\n\nData and metrics for tracking recruitment performance\n\nMany modern recruiting teams consider ATS software to be one of their most essential tools. By automating the process of tracking and screening applicants, an ATS helps companies focus on finding the most qualified candidates for their job openings.\n\nFor candidates\n\nATS solutions offer both advantages and drawbacks for job seekers:\n\nFor recruiters\n\nSimilarly, ATS software provides benefits and drawbacks for recruiting teams:\n\nHow to choose an applicant tracking system\n\nWhen selecting recruiting software, look for a solution that aligns with your organization's needs and your overall hiring strategy. The steps below should help you get started.\n\n1. Assess your needs\n\nBefore choosing an ATS, thoroughly evaluate your organization’s needs.\n\nGather input from key stakeholders within the HR and recruitment teams, as well as other departments that may interact with the system. Understanding the unique challenges your company faces in recruitment will help you identify the most important features you need in an ATS. Keep in mind that selecting and implementing an ATS can be time-consuming, so it’s important to choose a system that meets both your immediate and long-term needs.\n\n2. Set a budget\n\nConsider the pricing of different ATS options and how they fit within your company’s financial constraints. Weigh the cost of the software against the potential return on investment, such as improved efficiency and reduced time-to-hire.\n\n3. Review options\n\nOnce you have assessed your needs and set a budget, you’re ready to start reviewing your options.\n\nLook for a system that offers functionality that aligns with your recruitment goals and offers these key features:\n\nIntegrations with other tools in your HR tech stack, like your HRIS or HCM software, background check software, or talent management platform\n\nEase of use, so it doesn’t require extensive training or have a high learning curve for different team members in your organization to use it\n\nHolistic improvement across your entire recruitment process, including the candidate experience. The goal is for your ATS software to make recruitment better for your employees and candidates, so a good user experience from both sides is key.\n\nFrequently asked questions about applicant tracking systems\n\nStill have questions about ATS providers? Learn more in the FAQs below.\n\nWhat’s the difference between an ATS and a CRM?\n\nAn Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is primarily used to manage the recruitment process, from posting jobs to tracking applications and managing candidate information. A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, on the other hand, is designed to manage interactions with clients or customers. In recruitment, a CRM can be used to build and maintain relationships with passive candidates, nurture talent pools, and engage potential hires over time, complementing the functions of an ATS.\n\nCan an ATS help with diversity hiring initiatives?\n\nYes, many ATS platforms include features that support diversity hiring initiatives, like blind recruitment tools that remove identifying information from resumes and analytics to track diversity metrics.\n\nIs an ATS suitable for small businesses?\n\nYes, an ATS can be beneficial for small businesses by helping to streamline the recruitment process, save time, and improve candidate management. Many ATS providers offer scalable solutions with flexible pricing, making them accessible to small businesses with varying recruitment needs.",
      "# [Harver doubles its candidate management efficiency with Rippling Recruiting](https://www.rippling.com/customers/harver)\nHarver helped hundreds of clients use data to make faster, better hiring decisions. But after undergoing a large-scale acquisition and rebrand, the company assessed its own talent search methods and found its recruiting software could use an update.\n\n“We wanted to reduce cost on all fronts,” said Fariha Samad, Harver’s Global Talent Acquisition Manager. “The motto we ran with was ‘operational efficiency’—doing better with less.”\n\nThat first meant consolidating Harver’s HR tech stack, going from 10 vendors to just a single solution—Rippling. And while Harver still used the same ATS, Fariha wanted a more cost-effective recruiting solution to better integrate with its new HR systems.\n\nAs the sole person overseeing Harver’s recruiting efforts, Fariha drained hours of her packed schedule doing manual work caused by the old ATS’s lack of integration with other tools: posting job descriptions, re-entering data across multiple systems, and nudging hiring managers to submit feedback after interviewing candidates. Recruiters also hit roadblocks learning how to effectively use the ATS and properly configure its workflows.\n\nAfter looking at several other solutions, Harver chose Rippling Recruiting as their new ATS.\n\n“Rippling came at a much lighter price tag, felt easy enough for hiring managers to use, and had a much better interface than what we had before,” Fariha said. “Going back to the motto of ‘operational efficiency,’ it made the most sense to reduce our HR tech stack to one system.”\n\n01\n\nNew jobs posted and filled—in a fraction of the time\n\nInstead of using a patchwork of different systems, Fariha now uses Rippling Recruiting to quickly open and post new roles, tag hiring managers (who all had existing Rippling profiles) to alert them of resumes, and schedule calls for interviews.\n\nOnce Fariha’s team lands on an applicant they’d like to hire, Rippling automatically fills the candidate’s information into an offer letter—without anyone needing to manually input any data. From there, candidates who accept the offer are automatically converted into employees.\n\n02\n\nBetter candidate feedback\n\nFariha also uses Rippling Recruiting to collect candidate feedback. “It works beautifully now because Rippling is the one chasing hiring managers instead of me because they get an automated reminder to submit feedback every day.”\n\nAnd the recruiters have an easier time collaborating—Fariha appreciates the platform’s comments box, where authorized hiring managers can tag and discuss candidates. She also likes Rippling Recruiting’s AI-rendered summaries comparing feedback reports from different interviewers.\n\n03\n\nTight integration of all employee data\n\nNow, all of Harver’s recruiting and HR functions coexist under the same solution. Harver’s new ATS seamlessly syncs with its other Rippling products, all of which are built on top of a single source of truth for employee data, making it easy to report on who’s joining and leaving the company.",

      "# [Frogslayer’s IT department onboards employees three times faster with Rippling](https://www.rippling.com/customers/frogslayer)\nWhen Frogslayer first started, managing devices was slow, time-consuming, and error-prone. A member of the IT team had to purchase machines, manually set up software, and ship them to employees.\n\nAs the company scaled, it became clear that these inefficient processes would waste more and more of IT’s time and give new employees a slow start.\n\n“I’ve spent a lot of my IT career moving organizations out of firefighting mode,” said Brian Cahill, Frogslayer’s Head of IT. “I like researching and implementing new things, and finding the next cool new technology.”\n\nBrian needed to automate manual processes, from onboarding new employees to remotely managing their devices, without increasing headcount or diluting the quality of the employee experience.\n\nBy rolling out Rippling’s app and device management, Frogslayer eliminated manual processes, resulting in fewer open tickets and no need to grow their IT team.\n\n01\n\nAutomated device management\n\nFrogslayer rolled out Ripping’s app management and device management, and migrated their single sign-on (SSO) and devices into it.\n\nSince deploying Rippling, there are fewer tickets, so IT staff spend less time creating accounts and setting up devices. Brian and his team have more time to focus on their most strategic work.\n\nWith Rippling, IT and HR are in the same system, which means no more typos on first name and last name. No more ‘my signature’s off because somebody typed my job title wrong.\n\nBrian Cahill\n\nHead of IT at Frogslayer\n\nBrian is no longer surprised when HR hires new employees—he is able to purchase new devices well in advance of them joining and ensure a new employee hiring experience that is smooth, timely, and easy to customize.\n\n“Each time we roll out new software I am impressed by how easy Rippling makes the integration process,” said Brian. “Rippling is constantly improving and releasing new features each month, and I’m always looking forward to the next innovation.”\n\n02\n\nCutting out cumbersome onboarding tasks\n\nFrogslayer’s HR, IT, and admin staff no longer have to waste hours going through every onboarding task.\n\n“Employee downtime is lower because my technician is spending more time on tech support and less time on manual onboarding steps,” said Brian.\n\nOffboarding is more fully integrated, too. Azure AD only went as far as switching off a user’s authentication, whereas Rippling goes in and changes account details, like removing licenses.\n\nWe used to have a list we would spin up for every new employee, with 30 things we have to get done. With Rippling, that list is now gone.\n\nBrian Cahill\n\nHead of IT at Frogslayer\n\n03\n\nOne platform to rule them all\n\nBrian found that Rippling did everything the company previously used Microsoft for, with one crucial advantage: Rippling’s IT products are tightly integrated with the HR system.\n\nFrogslayer also needed LDAP to authenticate internal apps and RADIUS for WiFi authentication. Both of these came with Rippling and were easy to configure—unlike Microsoft, which requires standing up separate servers.\n\n04\n\nQuick and painless rollout\n\nWith some careful planning and implementation, and the fact Rippling was easy to configure, users didn’t notice a thing. And because Rippling configuration is simple to understand, Brian could save even more time: “You don’t have to create a wiki page, or a doc that says ‘here’s how to create a user in the system.’”",
      "# [Sitemate](https://www.rippling.com/customers/sitemate)\nWhile Sitemate was busy helping industrial workers and companies streamline their processes and digitize their information, its own operations flow left a lot to be desired.\n\nThe industrial software company relied on a tangle of spreadsheets, emails, and Slack messages to manage its HR needs. Processes were highly manual—to request time off, employees would email their manager, who in turn would email someone in accounting, who’d then add it to Xero.\n\nBut as Sitemate expanded from its headquarters in Sydney to London, Vancouver, and other global markets, Sitemate turned its attention to internal processes and saw an opportunity.\n\n\"We didn't have an HRIS system in place, so the operations team was fielding a lot of noise, a lot of 'what do I do' questions,\" said Annabel Tomlin, Sitemate’s VP of Operations. It was time for a change. Founder and CEO Hartley Pike went in search of a new solution.\n\nSitemate found Rippling, which revitalized the company’s workforce management processes and fit its needs like a glove.\n\n01\n\nA massive time-saver\n\n“Rippling just makes it so much easier and more efficient for everybody,” Annabel said. “It’s saved us so much time.”\n\nAll Sitemate employees are now onboarded through Rippling, a process that’s become a snap. And employees have “found it really useful and easy to use,” said Annabel. “The experience has been super positive.”\n\nSitemate managers are especially keen on the approvals app, which Annabel said is “a real game-changer.”\n\n“That’s been really awesome to have. Managers can go in and request promotions or configuration changes for their team,” she said.\n\nRippling just makes it so much easier and more efficient for everybody. It’s saved us so much time\n\nAnnabel Tomlin\n\nVP of Operations at Sitemate\n\n02\n\nA single source of truth—with powerful reporting capabilities\n\nWith Rippling, Sitemate finally had a platform that could house all of its data. “Having it all in one place is very handy,” as Annabel puts it. With one unified platform, the company can access powerful insights to share with key audiences.\n\n“It’s been handy in the recruitment process,” Annabel said, “being able to genuinely look at the makeup of our team and answer that question when someone asks, ‘How diverse is your team?’ I can actually pull the numbers and provide that information to hiring managers.”\n\nIn a similar vein, Sitemate now has a much clearer view of salary bands and compensation trends—and they can share critical data with the board and investors with confidence.\n\n03\n\nSOC 2 certification achieved\n\nWith Rippling’s app and device management, Sitemate successfully got its SOC 2 certification.\n\n04\n\nSupport during global growth\n\nAs a multinational company that’s continually expanding across the globe, Sitemate’s complex needs are being met by Rippling. Hartley describes Rippling’s ability to scale policies globally as “priceless.”\n\nAnd what’s really delighted Annabel and her team: Rippling is growing and evolving along with them.\n\n“We’ve laughed sometimes because we talk about needing to improve this process, and then we get an email from Rippling saying, ‘We’ve got this new app! Do you need this?’ And then we’re like, oh my God, yeah, just what we needed! You guys have thought of everything that we need.”",
      "# [What Is Work From Anywhere (WFA)?](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/wfa)\nWork from anywhere (WFA) vs remote work\n\nWhile both WFA and remote work offer flexibility and the terms are often used interchangeably, there are key differences between them:\n\nRemote work: Having a remote job typically means working from a fixed remote location, such as a home office. It often implies some geographic limitation, like working within the same country or time zone.\n\nWFA: Work from anywhere jobs allow employees to work from any location globally, providing them with greater flexibility and freedom in choosing where to live and work.\n\nHow work from anywhere (WFA) has changed\n\nWhile the concept of working from anywhere is not new, modern technology such as laptops, tablets, and video conferencing have made it much more accessible to a larger population of workers around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic also accelerated a global shift toward remote work and, in turn, WFA.\n\nWork from anywhere (WFA) before COVID\n\nBefore COVID-19, WFA was relatively rare and mostly accepted by tech companies and startups who employed traveling workers called “digital nomads.” Traditional businesses were often more hesitant to embrace WFA due to concerns about productivity, security, and communication.\n\nWork from anywhere (WFA) during COVID\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of WFA policies as businesses were forced to adapt to lockdowns and social distancing measures. Companies invested in digital tools and infrastructure to support remote work and work-from-home capabilities. But this made many new companies and industries realize the potential for maintaining operations without a physical office.\n\nWork from anywhere (WFA) today\n\nToday, WFA is increasingly common across various industries. Many companies have formalized their WFA policies, recognizing the benefits of flexibility, employee satisfaction, and access to a broader talent pool.\n\nWork from anywhere (WFA) in the future\n\nThe future of WFA looks promising, with continuing advancements in technology making it easier to work from any location. Companies are more likely than ever to adopt hybrid models, combining WFA with occasional in-person meetings to foster collaboration and company culture.\n\nHow do businesses know if WFA is right for them?\n\nBusinesses should consider some or all of the following factors to determine if WFA is suitable for them:\n\nThe nature of the work they do. Some roles require physical presence, while others can be done entirely online.\n\nTheir technology infrastructure. Adequate digital tools and secure networks are essential for adopting WFA.\n\nTheir company culture. Assess whether your company culture can support a distributed workforce.\n\nEmployee preferences. Do your employees want to work elsewhere? Gather their feedback regarding remote work.\n\nWhat is a work from anywhere (WFA) agreement?\n\nA WFA agreement is a formal document or policy outlining the terms and conditions for employees working from any location. It helps make sure both the company and WFA employees have clear expectations for their roles and responsibilities.\n\nWhat does a work from anywhere (WFA) agreement include?\n\nWhen drafting a WFA agreement, consider including these elements:\n\nEligibility: Criteria for employees who can opt for WFA.\n\nResponsibilities: Employee duties and expectations while working remotely.\n\nWork hours (if applicable): Defined working hours and time zone considerations.\n\nCommunication: Protocols for staying in touch with the team and management.\n\nSecurity rules: Measures for maintaining data security and privacy.\n\nCompliance: Adherence to local laws and tax regulations.\n\nPerformance metrics: How productivity and performance will be measured.\n\nFrequently asked questions about working from anywhere\n\nWhat are some common work from anywhere (WFA) jobs?\n\nIn the digital age, many job types can shift to WFA, from software development to customer support to even healthcare roles.\n\nSome of the most common remote and WFA roles today include:\n\nProduct managers\n\nAccount executives\n\nAdministrative assistants\n\nBackend and full-stack software engineers\n\nOperations managers\n\nProject managers\n\nSales managers\n\nSales representatives\n\nSocial media managers\n\nCustomer success representatives\n\nHow can businesses support their work from anywhere (WFA) employees?\n\nProvide the right tools. Make sure employees have access to the technology and software they need.\n\nEncourage regular communication. Establish regular check-ins and team meetings to maintain connection.\n\nProvide training and development. Offer thorough and high-quality onboarding, development opportunities, training on remote work best practices, and other ongoing training.\n\nWrite clear and consistent policies. Maintain clear and comprehensive WFA policies to set expectations and provide guidance—and enforce them consistently.\n\nHow do businesses handle time zone differences with WFA workers?\n\nTime differences can be handled by:\n\nAllowing employees to work flexible hours that fit their time zones.\n\nSetting core hours where all employees are available for meetings and collaboration.\n\nUsing tools like email and project management software to facilitate communication that doesn’t require real-time interaction.\n\nThoroughly documenting communication and collaboration workflows to keep the whole team on the same page.\n\nWhat are the legal considerations for implementing a WFA policy?\n\nLegal considerations for a WFA policy include:\n\nEnsuring employees comply with tax regulations in their location.\n\nAdhering to local labor laws regarding work hours, overtime, and employee rights.\n\nImplementing measures to protect sensitive company and customer data.\n\nHow can businesses measure employee productivity when their workers are distributed?\n\nBusinesses can measure productivity by defining specific, measurable objectives for employees, tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) related to output and efficiency, and conducting regular performance reviews and check-ins to discuss progress and address challenges.\n\nCan only full-time employees work from anywhere?\n\n​​No, both full-time and part-time employees, as well as independent contractors, can work from anywhere, depending on the company's policy and the nature of the job. The flexibility of WFA arrangements allows businesses to cater to different work schedules and employment types.\n\nWhere do businesses find WFA employees?\n\nBusinesses can find WFA employees through many different channels, but online job boards and job postings, like Remote.co, We Work Remotely, and Flexjobs, are the most common. To find workers who are a good fit for your open position, be sure to write a comprehensive, detailed job posting that includes relevant details and qualifications (For example, is the job entry level or does it require certain training or certifications? Is English proficiency required? Do candidates need to be available at certain times, like working hours in North America?)."

Rippling is perhaps one of the worst UX apps i’ve ever encountered. It’s a dumpster fire, and the company doesn’t care to improve it. There is no way to contact them unless you are the CEO of the company you work for.. Entering in hours requires you to pick the date on the calendar every single time, because I guess it’s normal for people to work 40 Hours straight? This causes needing to double check dates constantly vs one glance at your schedule, such a pain. Add dark mode option, and make UI more intuitive. By default I have to use two factor authentication. Despite setting up Duo, I have to log in, and give a text verification code each time I want to access Rippling on desktop, I then get a security email saying I logged in.. There is no way to opt out of this, and it makes entering hours multiple times a week into a nightmare of stress. Gusto was so much better. In Gusto you get a payday email with how much you get paid.

I then tapped the date field expecting to type a six (or eight) digit date. Instead, I found myself in a scrolling interface showing every day of the current month. Seeing that there was no way to bounce from year to year, I realized that I was faced with a test of endurance (and devotion to my wife)… swiping down, down, down, down… watching every day on my wife’s life flying by… muttering to myself, “Why do you have to be so old?” Halfway to the finish line, I started a screen recording on my phone. 2 1/2 minutes later, I arrived at 1981, asking myself, “How could some programmer have thought that five minutes of scrolling was a better solution than requiring a user to type six numbers on their keyboard?” Maybe there was too much room for error with that unvalidated approach🤓.

Recently had a situation where I needed to use my work’s COBRA policy and got no help whatsoever from rippling. Had to communicate with BCBS directly and fix errors made on rippling’s side. Unlike gusto or literally any other benefits company, you can’t communicate with any humans on Rippling’s side, which is infuriating to both the employee and health insurance provider. Who thought that was a good idea?? Having a dedicated HR person at your company doesn’t replace having someone at rippling if they don’t have access to what rippling does. You end up playing this game proxying communication through your HR person to rippling’s support team because they are the only ones able to get an actual phone number for humans on the other end.\n\nThat’s not the worst part - Eventually rippling’s website updated to show my policy and a few months later my health insurance was cancelled with no notification or warning! I had the pleasure of finding out I was uninsured when I went to go get a vaccine. As a matter of fact rippling’s website showed it was still good until Nov (this was in July) and they took no accountability to admit they were wrong when I verified it with BCBS. A little notice would’ve been nice. What’s great is I couldn’t communicate with any humans on rippling’s side! Literally no phone number, all communication is through your company’s HR person. My HR person didn’t know what was going on and assured me it was probably a glitch on rippling’s side since their website said the policy was still active. I couldn’t patch BCBS to Rippling to verify it was an error on their side because of the whole no humans thing so at the end of the day I was left without health insurance for a month while waiting for my policy on the private market to activate. \n\nRippling is a totally dishonest company that takes zero accountability for critical faults on their end.

All the information I needed was finally organized in one space: directory/employee hierarchy, insurance, tax info, etc. This essentially eliminated the nightmares of going through old saved emails with personal information, lost in the grapevine translations, and moved towards a more streamlined process. Lastly, I enjoy the constant \"reminders\" of essentials I need to sign and authorize such as benefit deadlines. I cannot imagine going back to any other platform. I wished every workplace integrated rippling into their systems.",

The app works better on iphone than android\n\n2. Online version you can see tasks (maybe if you have a joint admin account not sure about regular users) the app does not feature a task icon on iphone or android, so unless you pay attention to e mails they give you to your work or personal email you wont know what tasks need to be done.\n\n3. The app learning management is different than online, feels a little too bunched up trying to do questionnaires and watch videos. \n\n4. The app sometimes for some users just logs them in, and it is up to the user to navigate and fill things out, making HR have to walk each employee through the process of on boarding. Needs better flow, maybe even call to actions to walk employees through onboarding each section.\n\n5. When it comes to loading documents, on android it has problems sometimes saying error when accessing camera to take a photo, you need to exit app take a photo and then use photo upload. \n\n6. It shows the entire company, and if you have your personal phone number uploaded on on boarding, it shows it to the company employees too. Some people dont want personal information like that available to everyone in the company and you cant manually change it otherwise the company wont have information for you either. \n\n7. Some companies do not issue work e mails, so \nIf you have a personal one, it wont show, maybe a plus maybe not?\n\n8. They have an emergency contact section but only for one person and one number, would be great to have up to 3 people and 1 mobile and alternate for both. Would be nice if it showed a relation field too so i could put mom, dad, uncle, cousin, s/o or something as well, if i call and that person doesnt know who i am to someone they may hang up.

As you can tell, Rippling doesn't respond to any reviews, just like they won't respond to any issues you have. Can't see paystub until payday. Worst payroll app I've ever used.",

Rippling is perhaps one of the worst UX apps i’ve ever encountered. It’s a dumpster fire, and the company doesn’t care to improve it. There is no way to contact them unless you are the CEO of the company you work for.. Entering in hours requires you to pick the date on the calendar every single time, because I guess it’s normal for people to work 40 Hours straight? This causes needing to double check dates constantly vs one glance at your schedule, such a pain. Add dark mode option, and make UI more intuitive. By default I have to use two factor authentication. Despite setting up Duo, I have to log in, and give a text verification code each time I want to access Rippling on desktop, I then get a security email saying I logged in.. There is no way to opt out of this, and it makes entering hours multiple times a week into a nightmare of stress. Gusto was so much better. In Gusto you get a payday email with how much you get paid.

I then tapped the date field expecting to type a six (or eight) digit date. Instead, I found myself in a scrolling interface showing every day of the current month. Seeing that there was no way to bounce from year to year, I realized that I was faced with a test of endurance (and devotion to my wife)… swiping down, down, down, down… watching every day on my wife’s life flying by… muttering to myself, “Why do you have to be so old?” Halfway to the finish line, I started a screen recording on my phone. 2 1/2 minutes later, I arrived at 1981, asking myself, “How could some programmer have thought that five minutes of scrolling was a better solution than requiring a user to type six numbers on their keyboard?” Maybe there was too much room for error with that unvalidated approach🤓.

Recently had a situation where I needed to use my work’s COBRA policy and got no help whatsoever from rippling. Had to communicate with BCBS directly and fix errors made on rippling’s side. Unlike gusto or literally any other benefits company, you can’t communicate with any humans on Rippling’s side, which is infuriating to both the employee and health insurance provider. Who thought that was a good idea?? Having a dedicated HR person at your company doesn’t replace having someone at rippling if they don’t have access to what rippling does. You end up playing this game proxying communication through your HR person to rippling’s support team because they are the only ones able to get an actual phone number for humans on the other end.\n\nThat’s not the worst part - Eventually rippling’s website updated to show my policy and a few months later my health insurance was cancelled with no notification or warning! I had the pleasure of finding out I was uninsured when I went to go get a vaccine. As a matter of fact rippling’s website showed it was still good until Nov (this was in July) and they took no accountability to admit they were wrong when I verified it with BCBS. A little notice would’ve been nice. What’s great is I couldn’t communicate with any humans on rippling’s side! Literally no phone number, all communication is through your company’s HR person. My HR person didn’t know what was going on and assured me it was probably a glitch on rippling’s side since their website said the policy was still active. I couldn’t patch BCBS to Rippling to verify it was an error on their side because of the whole no humans thing so at the end of the day I was left without health insurance for a month while waiting for my policy on the private market to activate. \n\nRippling is a totally dishonest company that takes zero accountability for critical faults on their end.

After an update I thought they got rid of a whole section because there was no longer a button to access it. Then I accidentally discovered if you press on the top right corner you can access your profile and employment information. There is zero indication that you have to press up there and it almost feels like the app is trying to hide that information from you. Otherwise it's just a really poor design choice",

It is rife with big and little usability bugs. It constantly requires me to reset my password to use. It tries to do to much, and breaks into spaces such as OKTA is just flat out better at. \n\nIt is has grown faster than its technology leaders can wrangle.  It was once the darling of the tech space, but no more.

      "# Game changer!, 5 stars [(Stefalala, Apple App Store, 2022-10-04)](https://apple/9151218419)\nHave you ever been a new hire for a company and gone through numerous back & forth emails, drowning in doc attachments, and details of your employee benefits while still left dumbfounded? Yeah, we've all been there! When my previously workplace swapped from a competitor (strictly for paystub purposes) to Rippling, it was day and night! All the information I needed was finally organized in one space: directory/employee hierarchy, insurance, tax info, etc. This essentially eliminated the nightmares of going through old saved emails with personal information, lost in the grapevine translations, and moved towards a more streamlined process. Lastly, I enjoy the constant \"reminders\" of essentials I need to sign and authorize such as benefit deadlines. I cannot imagine going back to any other platform. I wished every workplace integrated rippling into their systems.",

      "# Difficult app, 3 stars [(mrsuggestions, Apple App Store, 2022-08-25)](https://apple/9016485397)\nDifficult app on the end user side - some issues below:\n\n1. The app works better on iphone than android\n\n2. Online version you can see tasks (maybe if you have a joint admin account not sure about regular users) the app does not feature a task icon on iphone or android, so unless you pay attention to e mails they give you to your work or personal email you wont know what tasks need to be done.\n\n3. The app learning management is different than online, feels a little too bunched up trying to do questionnaires and watch videos. \n\n4. The app sometimes for some users just logs them in, and it is up to the user to navigate and fill things out, making HR have to walk each employee through the process of on boarding. Needs better flow, maybe even call to actions to walk employees through onboarding each section.\n\n5. When it comes to loading documents, on android it has problems sometimes saying error when accessing camera to take a photo, you need to exit app take a photo and then use photo upload. \n\n6. It shows the entire company, and if you have your personal phone number uploaded on on boarding, it shows it to the company employees too. Some people dont want personal information like that available to everyone in the company and you cant manually change it otherwise the company wont have information for you either. \n\n7. Some companies do not issue work e mails, so \nIf you have a personal one, it wont show, maybe a plus maybe not?\n\n8. They have an emergency contact section but only for one person and one number, would be great to have up to 3 people and 1 mobile and alternate for both. Would be nice if it showed a relation field too so i could put mom, dad, uncle, cousin, s/o or something as well, if i call and that person doesnt know who i am to someone they may hang up. Better to start the call off indicating how i know them and who and why i am calling.",

      "# Post ID vcfyu7: I chose Rippling and highly regret it with +246 score by [(Rlvantage, Reddit, 2022-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/)\nThis is actually my first post here, but you guys are an amazing, helpful community and I wanted to share my experience so others are aware of how r/Rippling operates. I did my research before choosing Rippling, but apparently not enough. I went over my contract in depth before signing with Rippling, but apparently not good enough. Hopefully by reading my cautionary tale, I can prevent someone from making the same mistake. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nWe started with Rippling in March, and at first everything was going great. They actually have a really good setup to streamline the HR side of things with small businesses, and have some good extra technology features (for a cost) that I have not seen similar companies offer. We had 9 employees to start, and were told that Rippling charges per employee per month. So if at any time we hired more employees, we would obviously pay more that month for the additonal employees, which we were fine with. After several Zoom sessions with our Account Executive, we signed a 15mos contract.\n\nSince March we have gained and lost employees (due to us re-structuring the company), leaving our current total number of employees at 15. Well this month we were charged $800 more than what our usual bill is. When we reached out because we were obviously confused, we were told the higher charge was because Rippling is charging us for the number of employees we have, which is 25. We quickly said no that is not correct, we only have 15 employees. To which the response from Rippling was, \"well you once had 25 employees, so you need to continue to pay for 25 employees even if you don't have 25 employees\". \n\nWell seeing how Rippling is now telling us we have to pay an extra $800 per month for employees we do not have, and do not plan on getting for the next 12 Months, we wanted to find out if there was a way to possibly just reduce our head count back to 9. We figured we could just go back to Gusto with the rest of our employees, as they were always great and upfront about fees and cost. \n\nWhen we inquired about reducing our head count back to the original number, as we are a small business and cannot afford that extra cost per month, we were told that the  only way possible to do that is if we sign a 2-3 years additional contract with Rippling. We also were told that if we wanted to keep the employee count at 15, and just pay for the current number of employees we have, we would have to sign an additional 2-3 year contract to do so. \n\nSo apparently we are either stuck figuring out how to pay them an additional $800 per month for the next year, or stuck dealing with them for an additional 2-3 years no matter what happens with our business. \n\nI feel like Rippling is preying on my business and I don't know what to do. You can't speak to anyone by phone, only by email. What sucks about that is the person we've been communicating with only replies once every 24 hours, and just reiterates the same thing over and over again. I've asked legitimate questions as to why this is happening, and never get a direct answer. Worst part is the person I'm speaking to is an Account Executive with the company, so he is definitely trying to push us hard to sign this extended 2-3 year contract, even though we've only been with the company for 3 months. \n\nPlease don't make the mistake we did!\n\n\nTL;DR - Rippling baited and switched on us after being with them for 3 months. Payment for using their services went up over $800 per month unexpectedly on our 3rd month of using them. Rippling stated this is due to us having 25 employees at one point (started with 9, currently at 15), and that for the next 12 months our company will be charged for 25 employees whether we have them or not. The only way for us to be charged for the correct number of employees we have is to sign an additonal 2-3year contract with them, even though we just signed a 15 month contract with them 3 mos ago.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID icero9l with +99 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icero9l/) (in reply to ID vcfyu7):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID icff78j with +33 score by [(Rlvantage, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icff78j/) (in reply to ID icero9l):\nSmart!

After signing you went up to 9. If thier logic stands you shouldn't have to pay for the extra ee's.

I haven't seen anyone attempt to explain to you why your contract is structured the way it is. Everyone seems to just be acting like it's unreasonable. I'm not saying it isn't, but I'll add context from 20 years in managed services. \n\nYou engaged in a fixed fee contract for services. You should have signed a scope that explained the services that would be provided, options to scale up, and a term. You alluded to most of that in your op. Once you signed that, the company began work to onboard you into the technology, and subsequently hired people (account execs, help desk techs, sys admins, payroll professionals, etc.) based on having to support 9 users for your business for the next 15 months. \n\nThen, somehow, you restructured within 3 months, going from 9 to 25 employees and back down to 15. \n\nMost managed services companies deal with this in a handful of ways. \n\n1. They up your contracted number of users. Ie: they onboard new users for no upfront cost, and they hire additional personnel to meet the scope you signed originally. You can scale up, you can't scale down. \n2. They continue to bill for the 9, but t&m the shit out of you for everything else. Ie: you'd have probably paid several thousand for the amount of movement you had in 2 months. \n\nYou characterized this well when you said you made a mistake. You got into a managed services contract before you really had your business dialed in, and because you were unfamiliar with how they work, you're in a rough situation. \n\nMy advice: Tell the account exec in email that you did not understand the scaling terms in the contract, and that you do now. You're not going to pay them an extra $800/month for the next 12 months, but you would like to better understand how to avoid this situation for flux/temp staff in the future. If they have no options, execute whatever cancellation terms are in the contract, and inform them of your new provider. \n\nSide note: they're probably going to charge you to transition the services to a new provider. That work is usually not within the scope of the agreement. \n\nTL;DR - You oofed. Own it, look for reasonable resolution. Don't make the same mistake in the future. Exit if they can't be amenable to that.\n\n### Comment ID icg9tpj with +3 score by [(Rlvantage, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icg9tpj/) (in reply to ID icg4jq3):\nAppreciate the advice!

Glad to see you're reading all this stuff!\n\nRe: onboarding\n\nThere are two types of onboarding and offboarding activities. \n\n1. Onboarding of the operation - this is when you first start your relationship. The firm will come out and document all kinds of things about your operation that they need to perform their scope of work and roll out any technology tool sets that are required. This is either invoiced as a one time line item with a lower per user rate over the term of the agreement, or it is included in the rate over the term of the agreement. If it's included in the per user rate, that will impact drawdown schedules for early termination. Offboardings, likewise are not part of the service. Transfer of accounts, documentation, removal of toolsets, or decommission of assets. All of that requires labor not contemplated in the agreement. \n2. User/employee onboarding/offboardings - this is what happens when you hire/terminate personnel. Documentation updates, account provisioning/termination, workstation set up, training, etc. Non stable state activity. Again, some services may include these at different rates, or give you x amount of these per month/year for free, but you pay after. It sounded (and I could have this wrong) like you didn't have to pay anything when you ramped up to 25 users, you just had the higher rate.\n\nI couldn't find your email comment, but if they aren't willing to accept that you didn't understand the terms, and you do now, then move on.\n\nGood luck with your business!\n\n## Comment ID icg9tps with +2 score by [(clenchingboar, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icg9tps/) (in reply to ID vcfyu7):\nTry saying that you’re closing up shop and are dismissing all employees.

Easiest and fastest option though honestly is to just go back to Gusto.\n\n## Comment ID icgwjku with +2 score by [(jwith44, Reddit, 2022-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/icgwjku/) (in reply to ID vcfyu7):\nWhat’s making you pay?

For clarification for everyone, the way the contract works is if you add an employee, you are basically signing up for that license for the rest of the contract term (whatever is remaining out of the 15 months, where typically the first 3 were free.) That is an un-ideal situation if you are a seasonal employer and may peak during some months and then go back down. User licenses can be re-assigned, but you would need to terminate/offboard an employee before hiring a new one for that to work effectively. So it sounds as though as one time the poster did have a full 25 employees, but now has no use for the excess licenses.  We try to time our start dates if we know someone else is leaving to avoid being stuck with these dead licenses for the rest of the contract term. The quantity reset back down to the actual number of employees as the start of the next contract term, but I agree it is a deeply negative part of their contracts, especially when all services are stacked on top of each other, you end up having to pay for seats for every module whether you use them or not.  If you expect to have a highly fluctuating headcount, It would probably be best to stay away from Rippling or see if you can negotiate a different deal... but unlikely.\n\n## Comment ID kzvjg7s with +1 score by [(RudeEnd8411, Reddit, 2024-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vcfyu7/i_chose_rippling_and_highly_regret_it/kzvjg7s/) (in reply to ID vcfyu7):\n**Does anyone have a phone number Rippling?

Listing reasons below.\n\n1. Before even reading this, please read the reviews on [Blind](https://www.teamblind.com/company/Rippling/reviews) especially the ones for shit wlb, management, and culture.\n2. You won't be overworked as an intern(6-7 hrs daily for me), but you will **suffer** as a full timer. My mentor said multiple times hes worked weekends + 12+ hour days to get stuff done and said multiple times he's overloaded and \"dying\" (obv in quotes)\n   1. I've talked with multiple other teams about potential work and **all** of them looked like they wanted out and lost so much hair\n3. You think you're gonna learn stuff because its a unicorn? No fucking way here.\n   1. **Everything** and I mean **Everything** is based on output and getting shit done. No one gives a **fuck** about code quality and all you are is a code monkey.\n   2. There are multiple severe incidents a week and people have gotten fired for causing too many incidents\n      1. An incident where some IC helped => manager didn't like looking bad => the goddamn IC gets fired for helping FFS IMFAO\n   3. Oh yea no one gives a fuck about scaling here. We've lost a significant amount of customers because the product was too slow\n4. You know how Citadel has clawbacks for bonuses if you leave within the first year? Its kind of similar to Rippling but for ur paper stocks. Leave within 1 year and you get nada.\n   1. People have been fired before vesting in order not to pay out.\n5. Management is **draconian.**\n   1. If you're higher up and Parker/C Suite/EM's/PM's don't like you, you're out the door\n   2. Multiple good EM's have been fired\n   3. The new CTO is laying off EM's in order for his previous coworkers to come in and become the first \"VPs\"\n      1. We also fired our past CTO G.B. after a few months lol. Like a horse trying to lead donkeys on redbull to the moon\n6. Your manager does not give a **fuck** about you. You exist for your managers benefit and to look good. They can sideswipe you at any time.\n7. Ripplings RSU share prices given to new hires right now is absolutely overvalued.\n8. People in the India office are completly overworked(everything here is SF related however). Pretty common to see them online at 10-11pm. Was curious a few times late night and saw a few coworkers online at 2-3am.\n9. You may think hey there are no layoffs so it must be good like those overvalued startups.\n   1. We don't have layoffs we have PIPs and random firings instead\n10. You might think the wlb rating  [here](https://www.rippling.com/life) on their website is high and accurate you say?\n11. Those surveys they send arent anonymous. Disagree too much and you get fired. You don't need to include them in the data if they're fired rofl\n12. You think a \"high\" TC is better than all this? Here's the cherry on top\n13. Guess what the CTO doesn't believe in signing bonuses any more and RSU was reduced such that ur TC is around 20% lower. (230-250K tc => 190-210k tc \\[150 base is the same\\]).\n14. Go fucking work for Citadel pay if you want Citadel culture and management lol. No way 150 in base is enough to justify this shit.\n\n### Comment ID j6tqicc with +5 score by [(throwawaynoturtwin, Reddit, 2023-02-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/zmyzdk/what_is_the_consensus_on_rippling/j6tqicc/) (in reply to ID j0eh1zo):\ncurrent FT, obligatory i think experience is very team dependent.

The shares cannot be sold (sometimes you can on equity zen, but does not seem guaranteed), so while you have $X worth of stock, you can't turn that into money.\n\nWhen the company stock IPOs two things happen: the stock can now be sold for cash, and (one would hope) the value of the stock increases. So people that were getting a bunch of 'paper money' (levels.fyi says EM's get about 600k per year) can now turn that into real money, assuming it vested, and if the valuation goes up so does your TC, effectively. A success story is Warby Parker, which seems to have doubled in valuation in the year leading up to their IPO: in this example, the EM's stock would go from 600k to 1.2 million.\n\nThis can go the other way though: sometimes stocks tank. If someone were to sign an offer at Roblox just preIPO (they direct listed, but still), 2/3rds of their RSU has now halved in price.\n\nTL;DR (because I am super rambly)\n\npre-IPO stock is not worth any real money, so companies give it out more freely.

They help companies achieve SOC2 and other security/privacy certifications. The Vanta agent which gets installed on workstations collects a bunch of information about the configuration of your workstation and reports back to their platform, which is then used as compliance evidence for their regular audits.\n\nThe MDM likely doesn't do any tracking by default - they're there mostly to enforce certain configuration parameters (disk encryption, screen lock timeouts, etc). That said, it's trivial for them to be able to use the MDM to push out any other type of monitoring that is deemed appropriate by company leadership.\n\nI am not a fan of dragnet-style monitoring, but I have in a few cases, been asked by company leadership to perform some more detailed monitoring on a case-by-case basis - things like collecting browser history, etc. Once an MDM is installed, things like this are very easy.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID jgnl5rp with +1 score by [(alephthirteen, Reddit, 2023-04-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/jgnl5rp/) (in reply to ID 12pi5k6):\nTL;DR Getting a tablet or Chromebook or even a new MacBook Air to browse the web is going to be way cheaper and less disruptive to your life than ***getting a new job***. Don't think about how likely it is they'll catch you. That's the wrong framework. Think about whether being fired would be a hassle. I imagine it would be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like you are in a remote work situation? They probably aren't filming your house--some companies do demand the webcam stays on, but not many--but everything on the device should be **assumed** to be company monitored. Their money, after all.\n\n\\- They quite possibly can see your web history. Not via the MDM itself, but any number of VPNs or filtering softwares do this.- They almost certainly can tell what apps you install.- Whatever security/endpoint software they install could have tons of other capabilities, too. Keystroke monitoring, logging what devices you plug in, etc.\n\nI'm in IT and the guy in charge of keeping the Macs compliant, so I need to be walking the walk. I'm a big fan of watching a YouTube or two in the breakroom over lunch, so people don't chase me down for tickets. I put my iPad in my bag and leave it off until I'm at lunch, put my phone in hotspot, then pull up whatever and watch it. Full division. Not their WiFi network. Not their gear. No one disturbed (except perhaps by my weird laugh).\n\nIf it's something that needs something more power than say, a basic iPad, Android tablet or Chromebook can do, I'd recommend you take a step back and think again, not about whether they'll catch you but whether you should be doing it on company time. Pull out your phone and make a note of the URL if it's a cool article you want to read, then read it later. If it's music, do it on your phone. Other things, maybe just do it after work.\n\nBut I wouldn't be doing Photoshop freelancing or playing Civ 6 or development in Docker containers or whatever on company time, and I can't think what else might need that much power. Most things that might be legit background stuff for WFH could also be done by your phone.\n\nIf you're freelancing, first, check if your contract allows it. And if your contract allows it, you should ***absolutely not*** be doing that on hardware they paid for.\n\n## Comment ID jgoibku with +1 score by [(slykido999, Reddit, 2023-04-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/jgoibku/) (in reply to ID 12pi5k6):\nIf ever you’re concerned about what IT can do to the computer you’re using, you should do it on your own personally owned computer without MDM.\n\n## Comment ID k08fcay with +1 score by [(ratatouille_artist, Reddit, 2023-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/k08fcay/) (in reply to ID 12pi5k6):\nI just installed Vanta myself and luckily it doesn't seem too intrusive.

If you are slightly over extruding it will cause those. Sometimes speed is a factor to, needs to be slowed down. Manually calibrate your flow rate first and see if that helps. Make sure when you start a new print the auto calibrate is off. Then try slowing it down. If that doesn't help look into how to tram your bed and or adjust z height.

I would NOT recommend Rippling for any construction, sub-contracting business AT ALL. \n\nIf your employees’ work includes multiple rates in the same pay period Rippling will not work for you at all. The reports are shit- they’re really just basic spreadsheets and make it difficult to look through if you have multiple jobs or projects codes. The demo people will promise you the world and deliver very little. Compared to other systems your account manager is very unhelpful. Most help needs to be through their chatbot and the chatbot WILL give you false information and once you speak to a real person you’ll finally find out what you want is impossible with Rippling but “that’s a new feature that will be available soon” \n\nI think the Time & Attendance app is nice and easy so it makes clocking in and out manageable for employees. You get lots of options on customization and workflow automations. Garnishments, reimbursements, deductions are easy to input especially if your health insurance is one that integrates with Rippling. \n\nDepending on your needs it could be a good system but we are moving back to our previous payroll system after 5 months with Rippling and couldn’t be happier leaving.

And not all employees are unionized. \n\nThe scheduling piece is what would have worked so well for us. I just read too many mentions of compliance issues.

Rippling’s system is not meant for one employee to have multiple rates. Your company sounds like it would have the same issues we encountered.

We use the HRIS & Payroll. I’ve been heavily involved in both. The nature of our business has us onboard and off board a lot of people in cycles a few times a year.

On the plus side, Rippling offers a sleek, all-in-one platform that beautifully integrates HR and IT tasks—think of it as the multitool of HRIS!\n\nHowever, since Rippling is primarily U.S.-based, it sometimes feels like they're still fine-tuning the system for Canadian payroll nuances. We've encountered occasional hiccups with tax calculations and staying up-to-date with Canadian compliance, which can be a bit of a hassle.\n\nIf you're looking to gather more personalized insights or explore other options tailored for Canadian companies, my advice is to reach out to SelectSoftware Reviews. They offer free consults to anyone looking to buy HR tech and can provide you with a shortlist of payroll systems that fit your budget and needs.",

Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!\n\n  \nUpdate: I didn’t expect so many wonderful replies! I can’t thank everyone enough for the great suggestions.

Then, I will examine one or two of the Ravel/Debussy pieces mentioned. \n\nI also want to explore some of the other lesser-known (to me) pieces, even if only for analysis purposes (Rautavaara, Kapustin, Bartok).\n\nI could see myself learning the Bach and Sibelius for calming, more meditative practice.

This is my second homebrew subclass ever! Way of the Rippling Muscle is a Strength based monk subclass that focuses on battlefield control and punching people.\n\nI have taken inspiration from u/LaserLlama for some of the mechanics, check [his subclass](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/hfqbvx/way_of_the_boulder_a_subclass_for_monks_that_want/) out!\n\nMy PDF on GM Binder - [Way of the Rippling Muscle](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MHYH8ApOeS-6_RmbiBo)\n\nEdit: I've made updates to the subclass. Changelog detailed at the bottom. Thank you everyone who contributed with feedback!\n\n#Way of the Rippling Muscle\nI really love the concept of monks. The zippy zappy self reliant flanker is super fun to play. What I've always wanted to do, is play a monk that is completely reliant on themselves. And so here we are.\n\n**Macho Menace.** Turns this monk into a strength monk that can punch his way out of problems right from level 3. No more using a spear for that 1d8 damage dice upto level 11. Punching is even stronger now. AC is now calculated with strength. Grapples can trigger Martial Arts. And the athletics proficiency is a bonus.\n\n**Himbo Energy.** Something to mitigate damage for the low con on this slightly MAD build. Extra grappling goodness.\n\n**Ultimate Flex.** More grapple goodness. This subclass is pretty frontloaded and most features scale so I didn't think level 11 should be too strong.\n\n**Too Swole to Control.** Siege Monster is really flavour. The ground slam was designed considering the Open Hand monks level 17 ability, and utility as compared to just Flurry of Blows. The damage seems fair for the cost, considering you'll probably be using it with two grappled enemies.\n\nI am open to constructive feedback! Let me know what you think!\n\nChangelog: Made a few changes to text to make it less clunky.\n\nMoved Athletics expertise from level 17 to level 3.\n\nMoved free grapple movement from level 6 to level 11.\n\nRemoved monk level from damage mitigation from level 6 ability.\n\n## Comment ID g5sxnwb with +8 score by [(inkweary, Reddit, 2020-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/ivj9gy/way_of_the_rippling_muscles_a_monastic_tradition/g5sxnwb/) (in reply to ID ivj9gy):\nThis looks really fun, I really like the idea of a strength Monk. One quick thing, I would add a limit to the number of times you can take the 6th level reaction, maybe once every short rest, or make it cost a number of ki points. Being able to do it every round would be ridiculous.\n\n### Comment ID g5sxt0w with +2 score by [(Sir_Platinum, Reddit, 2020-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/ivj9gy/way_of_the_rippling_muscles_a_monastic_tradition/g5sxt0w/) (in reply to ID g5sxnwb):\nI'll significantly reduce the amount of damage mitigation to balance it out.

My gut says that is still quite powerful considering you get a lot of other things at 6th level too. I don't really know yet, though, I'm not an expert. You'd probably have to play test it to see. Maybe making it scale with level is a good idea. Perhaps your Monk level + str mod, but make it cost a ki point to do so? I really don't know, hopefully someone more experienced can chime in their wisdom.\n\n### Comment ID g5szban with +1 score by [(Shanderraa, Reddit, 2020-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/ivj9gy/way_of_the_rippling_muscles_a_monastic_tradition/g5szban/) (in reply to ID g5sxnwb):\nDisagree; comparing it to Uncanny Dodge is no contest, and Monks aren't super tanky anyway.\n\n#### Comment ID g5szqd0 with +1 score by [(inkweary, Reddit, 2020-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/ivj9gy/way_of_the_rippling_muscles_a_monastic_tradition/g5szqd0/) (in reply to ID g5szban):\nMaybe you're right.

Assuming a Strength bonus of +4 (which you should really have for your primary stat by level 6), that's an average damage reduction of 16.5, usable every single round. \nIt should either cost a ki point or be limited per rest.\n\n### Comment ID g5tafl8 with +1 score by [(Sir_Platinum, Reddit, 2020-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/ivj9gy/way_of_the_rippling_muscles_a_monastic_tradition/g5tafl8/) (in reply to ID g5t8r9o):\nAgreed, will abolish the monk levels. 1d12+str for a reaction and bsp damage only feels fair, considering you can only eat the damage one of the multiattacks of mostly melee monsters.\n\n## Comment ID g5t8rfg with +3 score by [(jayffthejanitor, Reddit, 2020-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/ivj9gy/way_of_the_rippling_muscles_a_monastic_tradition/g5t8rfg/) (in reply to ID ivj9gy):\nI like this concept but do feel that is is unbalanced. The 3 feels fine. The 6 is however too strong a d12 is too high, it would be better if it was a d8 as it is the monks hit die. The 11 is fine a little lack luster but fine most classes have a quality of life feature level the other comments people have made about it does  ring true go with what they are saying about it. Now the 17 is too strong. Getting a +2 and increase cap three level before the barbarian (which this all feels better suited to the barbarian as a sub but could work for monk) is simply too strong I'm not sure if you could balance it seeing as how that is a reward for reaching max level with a class and you get it here with room to multi into something else. The slam damage as a d12 is fine but the cap being 10 feels kinda high and would cause the monk to burn too many points too soon maybe reduce the cap to 5 that is still 6d12 and add str mod to the damage and it should be fine.\n\n### Comment ID g5ta8hv with +1 score by [(Sir_Platinum, Reddit, 2020-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/ivj9gy/way_of_the_rippling_muscles_a_monastic_tradition/g5ta8hv/) (in reply to ID g5t8rfg):\nThanks for the feedback!

They also have lots of office hours and extra training sessions, as well as Slack channels to help answer questions and further your knowledge.\n\nThe system is so user friendly that you and clients can figure out a lot on their own.

You are interacting with really smart people and teams on a day to day basis, and hence learning and growing.\n\nOpen and improved engineering culture: There aren't any boundaries on people to go and learn, major engineering projects are put in open for others to discuss and learn. The engineering team and culture has improved vastly in the last 2 years, with a lot of seasoned staff and senior staff engineers in the org.\n\nProduct and revenue growth: Rippling's clarity in what they want to build had been astonishing from day 1. Some of the products that we recently launched are things that comp any had in their plan from day 1. There is so much conviction and clarity into all the product and engineering investment that most of our products launched scale from 0 to few millions of revenue within their first year. The revenue growth has been astonishing, not derailed by many macro economic crisis. The revenue stream is diversified and proven to be resilient to so many external factors.",

This is a place to grow your career.

The reviews that state work life balance is awful are 100% true, and unfortunately, you will likely burn out before the company reaches their IPO anyway. This isn’t necessarily Ripplings fault entirely, it’s just that payroll, benefits, Hr is a grueling awful vertical to play in. You’ll quickly get tired of clients complaining about almost every aspect of the product. Trust me, it brings your life down so much that you’ll start questioning your career path. The executive team in this company needs to realize that sometimes building new SKU’s for the sake of new SKU’s is not going to sit well with your current client base. Current client enhancements can go often ignored… I expect a relatively high client churn rate for the next few years, before management gets the clue and maybe 180’s their strategy. They’ll need to do this before it’s too late and total ARR starts moving in the wrong direction. Product is struggling to scale to enterprise level/quality, but that’s a challenge at all SaaS companies. If you’re okay grinding and saying goodbye to your friends and family, then this may be an okay place for you. Otherwise, find a better SaaS vertical to play in.",

Instead, it has been incredibly refreshing as a member of the legal and compliance team to get a running head start on nearly all projects, so that we can pull together the right compliance infrastructure for our products, and be deeply embedded in our product initiatives, often dogfooding and testing what we've advised on and built. Our team has also gotten to be true advocates, fiercely defend our employees from aggressive competitor tactics, pulling together a first rate immigration program for our team, commanding one of the most efficient sales/commercial processes. In short, it is really fun (and rare) to help win as a business, while also doing it the right way and with flair. And we have fun :) \n\nRippling is also one of the most transparent places that I have worked in that, top down and bottoms up, people actually say what they are thinking and have discussions. While candor can take some getting used to (and for some, may seem like a con), it has meant that this has been the least political and bureaucratic place that I have ever worked. There's simply has been no room for politics (giving off appearance instead of reality) because people say whats on their mind, ask a lot of questions, and \"go and see\" what the truth/reality is.",

You can’t have the turnover this company has and execute a successful longterm strategy.\n-generally, middle managers are inexperienced and aren’t on your side\n-work-life balance is non-existent and in fact, the CEO has said in so many words that he doesn’t believe in it\n-there doesn’t seem to be an overall vision or strategy: for the product, for company initiatives, for any part of Rippling.

A lot of people who work here are kind and cool people but everyone is running around with their heads chopped off. -If you want to be so stressed out of your mind that you stop eating, lose your quality of life, then work here.

This isn’t necessarily Ripplings fault entirely, it’s just that payroll, benefits, Hr is a grueling awful vertical to play in. You’ll quickly get tired of clients complaining about almost every aspect of the product. Trust me, it brings your life down so much that you’ll start questioning your career path. The executive team in this company needs to realize that sometimes building new SKU’s for the sake of new SKU’s is not going to sit well with your current client base. Current client enhancements can go often ignored… I expect a relatively high client churn rate for the next few years, before management gets the clue and maybe 180’s their strategy. They’ll need to do this before it’s too late and total ARR starts moving in the wrong direction. Product is struggling to scale to enterprise level/quality, but that’s a challenge at all SaaS companies. If you’re okay grinding and saying goodbye to your friends and family, then this may be an okay place for you. Otherwise, find a better SaaS vertical to play in.",

Our team has also gotten to be true advocates, fiercely defend our employees from aggressive competitor tactics, pulling together a first rate immigration program for our team, commanding one of the most efficient sales/commercial processes. In short, it is really fun (and rare) to help win as a business, while also doing it the right way and with flair. And we have fun :) \n\nRippling is also one of the most transparent places that I have worked in that, top down and bottoms up, people actually say what they are thinking and have discussions. While candor can take some getting used to (and for some, may seem like a con), it has meant that this has been the least political and bureaucratic place that I have ever worked.

      "# [Rippling Raises $200M for Workforce Management Platform by PYMNTS, www.facebook.com on 2024-04-22](https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2024/rippling-raises-200-million-to-enhance-workforce-management-platform/)\nWorkforce management platform Rippling has raised $200 million in new financing in a Series F round that values the company at $13.5 billion.\n\nRippling has also signed agreements with investors to repurchase up to $590 million in equity from current and former employees and early investors, Rippling CEO Parker Conrad wrote in a Monday (April 22) blog post.\n\nThe company’s platform brings together human resources (HR), information technology (IT), finance and more to create a single source of truth for employee data, according to its website. It is integrated with more than 500 apps and helps businesses execute more efficiently.\n\n“Rippling’s core thesis is that employee data is critical to a surprisingly large number of business systems, including the ones well outside of HR,” Conrad wrote in the post.\n\nBy providing a single place where companies and employees can make changes, which then propagate everywhere automatically, Rippling solves the challenge of maintaining the accuracy of employee data across disconnected systems, according to the post.\n\nThis not only saves time but also enables more intelligent workflows and approvals, better role-based policies and permissions, and more powerful analytics, the post said.\n\n“The system we’ve built helps companies run more efficiently and achieve their business goals faster than their competitors,” Conrad wrote in the post. “We will continue to expand in new markets and invest deeply in R&D to enhance our current offering and build new products to support our clients.”\n\nIt was reported April 16 that Rippling was in discussions about a funding round that would value it at $13.4 billion. The company had already raised a total of $1.2 billion, TechCrunch reported at the time.\n\nRippling’s Series F round comes about a year after it raised $500 million in Series E financing and was valued at $11.25 billion. That valuation was about the same as its Series D financing in May 2022, the company said in a March 17 blog post.",
      "# [Rippling’s Parker Conrad on the company's new round, new SF lease and, also, its newest critic by Connie Loizos on 2024-04-22](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/ripplings-parker-conrad-on-the-companys-brand-new-round-its-brand-new-sf-lease-and-also-its-brand-new-critic/)\nLast week, TechCrunch broke the news that the workforce management software outfit Rippling was on the cusp of closing a new, $200 million round of funding at a hefty $13.4 billion valuation led by Coatue. We also reported that the round featured a separate, $670 million secondary component meant to give some of the company’s investors a bigger bite of the company, while letting Rippling’s employees — some of whom joined at the outset in 2016 — cash out some of their shares.\n\nRippling declined to comment at the time, but in an interview Friday afternoon, founder Parker Conrad confirmed our information, adding that the secondary component is actually a $590 million tender, with $200 million available for employees and $390 million available for seed and other investors.\n\nThe round, Rippling’s Series F, is also almost entirely an inside round. Coatue is an earlier investor in Rippling, along with other backers in this round that have been investing all along, including Founders Fund and Greenoaks. The only new member on the cap table is Dragoneer, a growth-stage investment firm in San Francisco.\n\nOf course, we were interested in much more than Rippling’s new fundraise, so while we had Conrad on the phone, we talked turnover. We discussed the company’s new office lease in San Francisco (right now, it’s the second-biggest lease to be signed this year in the city). Conrad also shared why Rippling is relatively “free” of AI. You can hear that full conversation in podcast form; if you prefer to read it, excerpts of that conversation follow, edited for length.\n\nSo why raise this money?\n\nHonestly, it started out as just an employee tender. We wanted to find a way to get some liquidity for early employees, so we went to market, looking really to do about $200 million for employees that wanted to sell some stock. [But] we got a lot of investor interest, so we expanded it first to include a small amount of primary [capital] — mostly as a way to get more ownership for investors that were looking to buy more — and then beyond that, we ended up expanding into seed investors as well.\n\nWhat does this secondary sale say about your plans to eventually go public? An IPO is a little bit in the distance?\n\nI definitely think it’s a bit in the distance, but it’s not like a way of delaying [anything]. If anything, it’s probably nice if there are people who want to buy a house or [want more cash] because life happens. It’s great to relieve some of that pressure before you go public so that you don’t have tons of people selling as soon as they can in the public markets.\n\nIs this the first time employees have been able to sell some shares?\n\nIt’s not. We did something in 2021. But it was smaller and the company was smaller, and it was a long time ago.\n\nDo you worry about employees leaving after cashing out?\n\nOne of the things that we talked about internally when we launched it was, we said, ‘Look, the first rule of an employee tender is that you don’t talk about the tender internally or publicly.’ We don’t want to see anyone spiking the football, or something like that. And the second rule of the employee tender is, ‘see the first rule.’ This is a very private, personal thing, and I’m thrilled for everyone [participating]; if this makes a difference in [their] life, that’s great. But it’s not the destination. The game’s not over.\n\nHow do you feel about turnover more generally? Some people don’t like to see it; other managers think it’s for the best. Elon Musk seems to be a fan, given the rate at which he turns over his executive team at Tesla.\n\nThe executive team at Rippling has been remarkably stable for a long time. A lot of the people on the team are people who I originally hired for those roles. Some of them are people I have long work histories with, even before this company. And certainly I always like to keep people. I mean, every once in a while, there’s an early Rippling employee who leaves the company, and I find it always just emotionally really sad when that happens, even if the company is going to be fine and they want to do something else or, you know, in some cases just kind of hang out. On a personal level, that’s always very difficult for me.\n\nYou newly leased 123,000 square feet in San Francisco for local employees, who are now back three days a week. How did you settle on that policy, and do you worry about retention or hiring?\n\nWe just think there’s an enormous amount of value of people being in the office together. We were never a company that was going remote. When we went remote temporarily during the pandemic, we said, this is for three weeks, and then we’re going back to the office. Of course, it was unfortunately a lot longer than that, but we were back in the office as soon as we could be. I think it’s possible for some companies to be fully remote, but it’s sort of like playing the game on hard mode. I think it’s a lot easier if people can get together in person; you get a lot done.\n\nIn the meantime, workforce management software is super crowded. You’re going up against a company that you famously co-founded and ran, Zenefits. There’s Paycor, Workday, Gusto, to name a few . . .\n\nThe weird thing is that Rippling is not actually a [human capital management] HCM company. Everyone who has been building business software believes that the way to build the best business software is to build these extremely narrow, focused deep products. And I think it’s completely wrong. I think the way you build the best business software is to build a really broad product suite of deeply integrated and seamlessly interoperable products. Yes, we have a very strong HR and payroll suite, but we also have an IT and security suite; we have a spend management suite, where we do things like corporate cards and bill pay and expense reimbursements. Actually, we’re using the primary capital that we raised in this round to fund the R&D efforts for a new, fourth cloud that we intend to launch in a completely different area.\n\nThe classic example of a company that builds software in this way is Microsoft. Microsoft is like the OG of compound software businesses.\n\nSpeaking of Microsoft, what is your “AI strategy”?\n\nWe are a company that is relatively free of any AI products right now. There’s some stuff that we’re working on. But I am always very skeptical of things that are, like, super trendy in Silicon Valley. So I can tell you what [our AI strategy] is not. I’m super skeptical of these chatbots. I don’t think anyone wants to chat with their HR software.\n\nI have to ask about a tweet related to our story about your new round. I saw [Benchmark general partner] Bill Gurley chimed in that “Anti-focus ain’t cheap.” I wasn’t sure if that was laudatory or a dig. Do you know?\n\nI assume given that it came from Bill that it’s a dig. And he’s not wrong that taking this opposite approach is expensive, particularly on the R&D side. If you look at Rippling financially, the thing that really stands out is how we spend on R&D. If you compare us to other HCM competitors — because you talked about the crowded HCM space — they spend an average of 10% of their revenue on R&D. Next year, Rippling is going to spend as much on R&D as [three rival companies] combined, and we have a much lower revenue footprint than the three. It’s definitely true that there’s a huge upfront investment phase in building what we’re building that obviously over time, as a percent of revenue, should come down. So he’s not wrong, but it’s a very explicit part of our strategy. What Bill might not totally understand is the benefit that you get from building software in this way; much higher upfront R&D costs [later result in] much higher sales and marketing efficiency.\n\nHas Bill ever done business with you?\n\nNo, I’ve never met Bill. He’s sort of a constant, low-grade antagonist, but I’ve never actually met him.\n\nI know he doesn’t get along very well with Marc Andreessen.\n\nThen Bill and I have that in common.

      "# [American HRtech disruptor Rippling seeks funding at $13.4B valuation — TFN by Abhinaya Prabhu on 2024-04-18](https://techfundingnews.com/american-hrtech-disruptor-rippling-seeks-funding-at-13-4b-valuation/)\nSan Francisco-headquartered HRtech startup Rippling is in talks to raise new funding of $870 million valuing it at $13.4 billion. Last year, the company secured $500 million in a Series E round, which valued it at $11.25 billion.\n\nUpcoming funding plans\n\nAs per TechCrunch, the upcoming round is said to include a $200 million injection of capital and $670 million of shares being sold by existing stockholders. It is also reported that existing investor Napoleon Ta at Founders Fund is prepared to invest up to another $310 million. This would be the largest check that Founders Fund has ever written for a single company’s round. In addition, existing investor Coatue (invested in Ramp and GoStudent) will lead the round alongside participation from Greenoaks.\n\nRippling’s last round came during the Silicon Valley Bank crisis, when the company’s funds were suddenly frozen. The company extended its own capital to fund its customers’ payments to employees, hoping to recover funds from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC).\n\nGoing by the report, the upcoming Series F round would add to the total of $1.2 billion Rippling has raised until now.\n\nNotably, the talks with investors are ongoing, with plans to finalize terms within a few weeks, people familiar with the matter said. The discussions are still fluid and the numbers could change.\n\nFunds utilisation\n\nThe San Francisco-based startup will use the new funds to land more mid-size business customers internationally and continue building more products. The company recently signed a 123,000-square-foot lease in San Francisco for office space that would give it room to hire hundreds more people. The lease is the city’s second-largest of the year, said the outlet.\n\nAutomation-focused HRtech\n\nCloud-based HRtech platform Rippling was founded by Parker Conrad and Prasanna Sankar in 2016. It is designed to assist with onboarding, payroll, benefits, and vacation tracking. The automation-focused HR software and service solution suited for small, mid-size and enterprise businesses that want to provide an effortless employee onboarding experience.\n\nThe employee management platform streamlines people operations with the help of intuitive automation. Employers can send offer letters, run background checks, collect new-hire paperwork, add employees to payroll, and process health insurance enrollments.\n\nThe platform can also be used to order and ship work equipment to new hires and set them up with everything they need to be successful, including Google Workspace, Slack and Microsoft 365.",
      "# [Governor Hochul Announces State Investment in Tech Firm Rippling’s Expansion in Lower Manhattan to Unlock $29 Million in Research and Development Funding](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-state-investment-tech-firm-ripplings-expansion-lower-manhattan)\nGovernor Kathy Hochul today announced that San Francisco-based Rippling, an innovative workforce management platform, will expand its operations in New York City threefold, creating 390 new jobs and unlocking a $29 million investment in New York-based research and development over the next 10 years. The company, which will occupy 69,000 square feet on the 59th and 60th floors of 4 World Trade Center, is expanding its operations to harness New York City's exceptional workforce talent and benefit from its leadership in the tech and innovation economy, fueling further growth through substantial investments in research and development. Rippling’s expansion in New York City builds on Governor Hochul’s commitment to attracting innovative businesses to New York State, building a 21st century economy, and creating good jobs for New Yorkers.\n\n\"New York is investing in innovative businesses like Rippling that are driving growth in new industries, creating good jobs for New Yorkers, and securing the economic future for our state,” Governor Hochul said. “Rippling’s commitment to tripling its footprint here and investing millions over the next decade to support research and development is proof that our efforts are working, and my administration will continue to support the industry leaders whose breakthrough technologies in AI and other sectors will move our economy forward.”\n\nRippling has committed to creating at least 390 new jobs across its marketing, finance, legal, sales, operations, and engineering teams while retaining 173 full-time employees, supported by up to $3.5 million in performance-based Excelsior Jobs Program tax credits from Empire State Development. The expansion also enables Rippling to invest more than $29 million in research and development spending in New York State over 10 years to build new products and advance its market-leading Spend Management platform, which helps companies manage expenses more efficiently.\n\nEmpire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight said, \"Investing in high-growth companies like Rippling strengthens New York's reputation as a global tech hub, sparking innovation and creating good-paying jobs. ESD is thrilled to support Rippling's expansion as part of our ongoing efforts to cultivate a thriving 21st-century economic landscape. By nurturing tomorrow's industries today, we are unlocking promising futures and fueling inclusive prosperity for all New Yorkers.\"\n\nRippling Co-Founder and CEO Parker Conrad said, \"Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance, bringing together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. By consolidating all of a company's employee data and tools into one system, Rippling enables our clients to achieve their goals faster and more efficiently​. We're grateful for Governor Hochul's leadership ​as we grow the team ​to support our expanding business. 4 World Trade Center is the ideal location as we expand our footprint in New York City.\"\n\nTech:NYC President & CEO Julie Samuels said, “Rippling’s expansion and hiring plans confirm what tens of thousands of other tech companies know: New York City is one of the most attractive places in the world to build and grow a tech company. The tech sector remains committed to powering the region’s economy, and we’re thrilled that leading innovators like Rippling are choosing New York to create jobs, source top talent, and further bolster the city’s position as a global hub for innovation.”\n\nFounded in 2016, Rippling streamlines human resources, information technology, and finance on a unified platform tailored for businesses with 2-2000+ employees, including through the use of artificial intelligence. Rippling consolidates employee management into a single system by centralizing payroll, benefits, device management, and more. This consolidation enables seamless, swift onboarding—allowing companies to configure payroll, corporate cards, devices, and apps for new hires in minutes. With its New York City expansion set to accommodate hundreds of additional hires, Rippling will leverage the larger footprint to keep pace with rapidly accelerating demand while cultivating an in-person work environment.\n\nThe company’s expansion in New York complements Governor Hochul’s State of the State proposal to secure New York’s place at the forefront of the artificial intelligence transformation. The Governor announced the creation of Empire AI, a consortium that will create and launch a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence computing center in Upstate New York to be used by New York’s leading institutions to promote responsible research and development, create jobs, and unlock AI opportunities focused on public good.\n\nIt also represents one of several cutting-edge companies contributing to the acceleration of New York City’s innovation economy under Governor Hochul. With New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Governor Hochul announced progress on SPARC Kips Bay, a first-of-its-kind life sciences career and education hub that will anchor the industry in New York; opened the $700 million state-of-the-art TaysteeLab Building and $9 million expansion of Harlem Biospace in West Harlem; announced Schrödinger, Inc’s $7.6 million expansion in Times Square; the $3 million expansion of communications company MetTel, and the selection of New York City as the future home of the $300 million Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Biohub.",

      "# [Rippling sets its sights on performance management with latest product by Courtney Vinopal on 2024-05-08](https://www.hr-brew.com/stories/2024/05/08/rippling-performance-management-product)\nAmid the disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic, some employers let performance reviews fall by the wayside—at least temporarily.\n\nBut they may be back with a vengeance, thanks to CEOs who became hyper-fixated on metrics like efficiency and productivity when the economy cooled last year.\n\nThe workforce platform Rippling set its sights on performance management for its latest product rollout, as well. COO Matt MacInnis said Rippling’s new product, which the company announced on May 8, is intended to help employers monitor performance on a more consistent basis, and free up HR to work on more complex tasks.\n\nWhy Rippling is investing in performance. In the current economic environment—one characterized by higher interest rates and elevated layoffs, particularly in Silicon Valley—“company leadership is trying to squeeze more productivity per dollar,” MacInnis said.\n\n“It’s very clear to me that the standards for employee performance are far more stringent today than they were two or three years ago when the going was good,” he said. “There’s a lot of pressure from companies to actually implement proper performance management programs.”\n\nMacInnis acknowledged that it’s hard for managers to carve out time to give employees feedback, and said the product is intended to help them facilitate more continuous reviews. Rippling’s performance management supports “milestone-driven reviews” that employers can set depending on what makes sense for their workforces: Rippling, for example, conducts reviews for new employees during their first 30 and 90 days.\n\nThe product is intended to address other common “pain points” in the performance management process, according to a press release for the company. It draws on employee data already in the Rippling system so that leaders can compare goal trends against data on department, level, tenure, or revenue targets, for example. Permissions are handled automatically, so the appropriate managers and HR leaders have access to employee ratings. And the product links to companies’ payroll systems so any changes to an employee’s merit or level are reflected automatically.\n\nFreeing up HR managers. The latest addition to Rippling’s product suite reflects the company’s efforts to go head-to-head with point solution vendors designed to tackle one aspect of HR, such as spend management or payroll, rather than streamlining such administrative tasks all in one place.\n\nRippling, which closed a $200 million Series F fundraising round in April valuing the startup at $13.5 billion, touted the rates at which some of its recently launched products have been “replacing point solutions from companies that have been in-market for years” in a recent investor memo. MacInnis said Rippling’s software features “common reporting and common workflows,” so that customers can build payroll, expense, and performance management reports, for example, on a common interface, as well as integrate data from different applications. The “homogeneity” of Rippling’s products, he suggested, is “one of the reasons that once customers begin with Rippling, they tend to just migrate all of their business processes into our various applications.”\n\nRippling’s mission to “free smart people to work on hard problems” might mean their customers are working with leaner departments, as well. In its investor memo, the company said businesses who use Rippling employ “about half the number of people in HR, IT, and finance” as companies using competitor systems.\n\nUltimately, the hope is that streamlining HR processes in one place will help cut your “HR business partners loose, to do what they want it to do for a living,” i.e., engage with managers, rather than manage spreadsheets, MacInnis said.",

It is especially well suited for businesses that are growing rapidly or expanding into new markets. Rippling can help businesses automate their HR processes, streamline workforce management and manage their IT assets more efficiently.\n\nRippling is also a good choice for businesses that need a global payroll solution. Rippling can support payroll for employees, including complex tax and HR compliance requirements, in several countries.\n\nHere are a few of the attributes that make Rippling an excellent HR solution:\n\nRippling can be used as a PEO, global payroll provider or stand-alone HR software platform.\n\nYou can customize Rippling’s automation features to streamline many HR functions.\n\nRippling offers a combination of HR and IT functions in one centralized platform.\n\nKey TakeawayKey takeaway\n\nRippling provides a centralized workforce management platform that allows businesses to access functions related to payroll, HR, employee benefits and IT.\n\nWho Do We Recommend ADP For?\n\nADP TotalSource is an excellent solution for businesses of all sizes. However, it’s especially well suited to midsize and large businesses. It’s also a good choice for businesses that need a comprehensive HR and payroll solution that can scale as they grow. We like that ADP offers a high level of customer support and can help businesses comply with complex HR and payroll regulations.\n\nADP also offers various industry-specific solutions for hospitality, healthcare and retail businesses.\n\nHere are some attributes that make ADP a great choice for businesses that want to outsource their HR functions:\n\nBusinesses have the option to partner with ADP as a PEO, human resources outsourcing provider or stand-alone HR platform.\n\nADP’s competitive benefits and payroll platform are great for midsize and growing businesses.\n\nADP provides a team of HR experts to assist businesses with their specific HR needs.\n\nDid You Know?Did you know\n\nADP is a top-rated HR solution and is considered among the best HR outsourcing services in the industry.\n\nRippling vs. ADP Comparison\n\nPricing\n\nRippling\n\nRippling doesn’t provide much pricing information online, primarily because it’s such a highly customizable platform. To get a quote, you must contact a representative to build an HR, finance and IT package based on the features you need. The base workforce management platform, Rippling Unity, starts at $8 per month. However, you’ll likely want to add more features to handle your HR and other operational needs.\n\nHere are some key points about Rippling Unity pricing:\n\nRippling Unity service plans: Users can choose from four base plans: Core, Pro, Unlimited and Enterprise. Each tier provides various workforce management features, including global workforce analytics and policy management.\n\nAdd-ons: Rippling also offers various add-on modules, including IT asset management, mobile device management and app management. Add-on prices depend on the specific module and the number of users. More traditional HR add-ons include payroll processing (U.S. and global), benefits administration, time-tracking tools, HR compliance assistance, recruiting and onboarding services, and more.\n\nProduct demo: While we would have liked to see a free trial, we appreciate that potential customers can access a free product demo to get a feel for the platform.\n\nADP\n\nADP outlines its payroll and PEO plans online. However, like Rippling, it doesn’t list its prices online. Instead, the company has customizable plans based on a business’s size and needs.\n\nADP offers two bundles with payroll and HR functions that may appeal to small businesses:\n\nComplete: The Complete plan includes payroll with direct deposit and other essential features, along with new-hire onboarding, background checks, HR training and tool kits, and more.\n\nHR Pro: The HR Pro plan includes everything in the Complete plan, plus employee handbook assistance, an applicant tracking system, a learning management system and more.\n\nPEO services, compliance functions, benefits, time and attendance features, and other services are also available. Again, to get pricing information, you’ll need to contact the company for a custom quote.\n\nConsider these additional points about ADP’s pricing:\n\nEmployers must have at least five employees to use ADP’s PEO services.\n\nADP offers base plans and optional add-ons.\n\nADP has PEO and non-PEO plans.\n\nBest Pricing\n\nTie\n\nWe called a tie in this category. ADP and Rippling have similar pricing models. Both offer base plans and a wide range of optional add-ons. Although Rippling lists its starting price per employee online, you'll likely need several additional features, which means you'll have to contact a representative to get a custom quote, just as you'll need to do for ADP. Both PEO services also require employers to have a minimum of five employees.\n\nTipTip\n\nCheck out our review of Zenefits if transparent pricing is important to you. Zenefits clearly outlines the prices of its HR services and add-ons online.\n\nHR Services\n\nRippling\n\nEssential HR features: Rippling’s base plan gives you the foundational HR features you need to onboard new hires, create and enforce company policies (like ​​time-off policies), manage employee data, automate workflows, and track vacation and leave time.\n\nOptional HR services: Rippling’s optional HR add-ons give you the power to recruit top talent, manage employee benefits, track time and attendance, process payroll, train employees and get HR support, all in one place.\n\nFinance and IT services: Rippling’s finance and IT products (e.g., inventory, expense and app management) seamlessly integrate with its HR features to create one centralized management platform.\n\nPEO services: PEO and employer of record services are available. Rippling users can scale between PEO and non-PEO services.\n\nADP\n\nEmployee acquisition features: ADP offers a suite of employee acquisition features for recruiting, onboarding, training and managing workers.\n\nEssential HR services: ADP provides essential HR administrative services, such as employee handbook creation, document management and HR reports.\n\nCompliance solutions: ADP’s compliance and risk management solutions help businesses protect their employees, manage workers’ compensation claims, verify employment statuses, and navigate unemployment claims.\n\nFYIDid you know\n\nADP consistently monitors changes to payroll regulations and labor laws, including minimum-wage laws, and alerts businesses to necessary updates.\n\nBest HR Services\n\nRippling\n\nBoth Rippling and ADP offer comprehensive HR services to help businesses manage their HR functions efficiently. However, Rippling's ability to automate many of these services stood out to us because HR automation streamlines a company's HR processes. Rippling also offers app and device management services, allowing employers to manage these functions on the same platform as their other, more traditional HR services.\n\nRippling’s device management feature directly integrates with the rest of its HR functions. Source: Rippling\n\nPayroll\n\nRippling\n\nTime and attendance functions: Rippling’s time and attendance functionality can sync seamlessly with its payroll and PTO features.\n\nPayroll processing: If you choose Rippling’s PEO option, you must use the company’s payroll processing services. However, you can also add U.S. or global payroll to your subscription.\n\nAutomatic payroll calculations: Rippling takes the hassle out of payroll by automatically calculating and filing all of your payroll deductions and payroll taxes, including federal, state and local taxes, as well as W-2, W-4 and 1099 forms.\n\nRippling’s time-tracking data can automatically populate into your payroll. Source: Rippling\n\nADP\n\nPayroll processing: Businesses that want to partner with ADP as a PEO must use ADP’s payroll solution. However, companies can also use ADP’s payroll platform as a stand-alone product for U.S. and global payroll without a co-employment model.\n\nTax services: ADP offers payroll tax filing as well as business expense tax registration services.\n\nBenefits administration: ADP’s comprehensive employee benefits can sync with its payroll platform.\n\nOptional payroll features: Additional payroll options include audit and reconciliation services, multi-jurisdiction payroll, and state unemployment insurance management.\n\nDid You Know?Did you know\n\nADP has a helpful feature that can walk employees through the benefits administration process and assist them with choices and applications.\n\nBest for Payroll\n\nADP\n\nAlthough both Rippling and ADP offer comprehensive domestic and global payroll processing and tax filing, we found ADP's payroll and benefits slightly more comprehensive. We were impressed with ADP's optional features, like audit and reconciliation services, multi-jurisdiction payroll, and state unemployment insurance management. We also like that ADP offers robust and affordable employee benefits and a range of tiered payroll plans.\n\nADP’s plan comparison tool can help employees choose the best benefits options. Source: ADP\n\nUsability\n\nRippling\n\nWe found Rippling’s interface and customizable workflows intuitive and straightforward; the platform is easy to use and navigate, and helps to streamline HR processes. We like that the unified system centralizes HR, IT and finance data in one place for efficient management. We were also impressed that Rippling can automate many HR functions.\n\nADP\n\nADP’s customizable HR platform helps businesses tailor a solution to their specific needs. We like that the ADP Marketplace facilitates seamless integrations with hundreds of third-party solutions. Additionally, ADP’s iOS and Android mobile apps offer convenient access on the go.\n\nBest for Usability\n\nRippling\n\nDuring testing, we were pleased to find that both Rippling and ADP offer intuitive products with clean interfaces. However, we were especially impressed with Rippling's ability to automate so many HR functions. While this does add some time and effort on the front end to customize the solution, it can ultimately save your HR professionals countless hours by eliminating repetitive HR tasks.\n\nCustomer Support\n\nRippling\n\nRippling offers standard email and web chat support. Users must pay to add Rippling’s HR Help Desk: HR Support if they want direct access to phone support. Rippling also offers basic online resources, like templates, blogs and a help center.\n\nADP\n\nWe like that ADP’s plans automatically include phone, email and web chat support and that users can access a dedicated HR representative. For further support, ADP users can also connect with HR experts and access online resources.\n\nBest for Customer Support\n\nADP\n\nThis was another close call, but ADP's customer support came out on top. We like that ADP is IRS- and ESAC-certified; Rippling is not. ADP also offers phone support, whereas Rippling users must pay extra for that feature.",

      "# [A fintech collapse is rippling through a small corner of the banking world by David Hollerith on 2024-07-01](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-fintech-collapse-is-rippling-through-a-small-corner-of-the-banking-world-143054499.html)\nThe unraveling of fintech upstart Synapse is rippling through a small corner of the banking world, leaving thousands of customers without access to their money and a mystery about millions of dollars that went missing.\n\nFour small US banks have some of the money. No one is sure where the rest went.\n\nThe saga surrounding the bankruptcy of Synapse, a 10-year-old fintech firm, puts a new spotlight on how loose webs of partnerships between venture-backed upstarts and FDIC-backed lenders can go so wrong.\n\nRegulators are more closely scrutinizing these relationships and warning various banks to tighten their controls when working with fintech firms.\n\nEarlier this month, the Federal Reserve slapped one of Synapse’s partner banks with an enforcement action that identified risk management weaknesses surrounding such partnerships.\n\nRead more: What is a neobank and is it safe?\n\n'Banking as a service'\n\nSynapse was part of a wave of new fintech firms that emerged in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis as Silicon Valley-style digital banking upstarts promised to shake up the world of traditional finance.\n\nIn just a decade it became a major middleman between dozens of fintech companies and community banks by offering what it called \"banking as a service.\"\n\nIt provided digital banking outfits like Mercury, Dave (DAVE), and Juno with access to checking accounts and debit cards they could offer their customers. It was able to do this by partnering with FDIC-backed banks that, in return, got a new source of deposits and fee revenue.\n\nThe traditional lenders that partnered with Synapse included Evolve Bank & Trust, American Bank, AMG National Trust, and Lineage Bank, all small banks compared with giants like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) or Bank of America (BAC).\n\nThe largest was Evolve, which had roughly $1.5 billion in assets at the end of the first quarter.\n\nThe pitch that Synapse effectively gave to these smaller banks was \"we’ll bring in the deposits; you don’t have to do much,\" according to Jason Mikula, an independent fintech consultant who publishes a weekly newsletter and has followed Synapse.\n\n\"This turned out not to be accurate, in my opinion,\" Mikula added.\n\nThe problems surfaced shortly after Synapse filed for bankruptcy in April when it could not reach an agreement with Evolve on a settlement of funds.\n\nThree weeks into the bankruptcy proceedings, Synapse cut off Evolve's access to its technology system. That, in turn, forced Evolve and the other partner banks to freeze customer accounts.\n\nBoth parties blamed each other as the culprit.",
      "# [Greenboard Announces $4.5M Seed Round from Base10 Partners to be \"Rippling for financial compliance and operations\" on 2024-05-08](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/greenboard-announces-4-5m-seed-round-from-base10-partners-to-be-rippling-for-financial-compliance-and-operations-302140085.html)\nNEW YORK, May 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Greenboard, a new compliance and operations software company for financial services, announced today that the company has completed a $4.5 million Series Seed funding round led by Base 10 Partners, with participation from Y Combinator, General Catalyst, Wayfinder Ventures, Liquid2 Ventures, Twenty Two Ventures, Rogue Capital, Transpose Platform, and others. The funding will accelerate the company's progress towards building a singular, AI-powered platform to handle management of the entirety of financial firms' compliance programs, and eventually all back office processes.\n\n\"We founded Greenboard after witnessing how cumbersome and outdated compliance software is at most financial firms,\" said Dave Feldman, Co-founder and CEO of Greenboard. \"This fundraise, along with our partnership with Base10, will help us enable financial institutions to operate their back office teams at a higher standard, with half of the headcount. We're starting with compliance, where we see incredible need from an underserved set of users.\"\n\nFounded in June 2023 by Dave Feldman and Ed Schembor (CTO), Greenboard already allows financial institutions to replace outdated software with an AI-native compliance operating system for use cases such as Know Your Employee (KYE) and Communications Archiving. The pair met as freshman at Johns Hopkins, and have since gone on to lead teams at Amazon, Hive AI, and Guideline.\n\n\"The Greenboard team has been great to work with. The administrative benefits of the system are tangible, in that it helps us detect risk and automate more of our compliance program than previously possible. The software is also easy to use, which matters a lot in a world where we compete to attract the best financial advisors to our firm,\" said Brook Powers, CEO, Fiduciary Financial Advisors, a Greenboard customer.\n\nGreenboard's core product thesis is that GPU-powered computational statistics will eliminate much of the tedium in back office financial work. \"It wasn't always the case that financial firms could count on cheap hard drives and cloud computing to keep records,\" said Dave Feldman. \"Not long ago when filing cabinets were the norm, financial recordkeeping required substantial resources. It turns out that computers are cheaper and better than humans at storing files by such a wide margin that there are no longer roles for file clerks in the economy.\"\n\nSimilarly, Greenboard's goal is to expand upon the past advances in financial recordkeeping via automating the preliminary analysis of information required to drive back office and compliance processes.\n\n\"Greenboard's innovative approach to financial compliance and operations aligns perfectly with our investment philosophy at Base10,\" said Rexhi Dollaku, Partner at Base10 Partners. \"We believe in supporting visionary founders like Dave and Ed, who are revolutionizing how financial institutions manage their back office processes. With this investment, we are confident that Greenboard will continue to lead the way in delivering AI-powered solutions that drive efficiency and effectiveness in the financial services industry.\"\n\nTo get in touch with the Greenboard team, reach out at [email protected].\n\nAbout Greenboard\n\nGreenboard, Inc. was founded in 2023 to build an all-in-one operating system for financial back-offices. Greenboard's founding team consists of Dave Feldman (CEO) and Ed Schembor (CTO) who have a 10+ year relationship. The team participated in the Y Combinator Winter 2024 accelerator program, and now help protect billions in client assets.

    "# Comprehensive Report on Rippling\n\n## Company Overview\nRippling, founded in 2016 by Parker Conrad and Prasanna Sankar, is a San Francisco-based workforce management platform that integrates human resources (HR), information technology (IT), and finance into a single system. The platform is designed to streamline various business processes, including onboarding, payroll, benefits administration, and device management, making it particularly suitable for small to mid-sized businesses as well as larger enterprises. As of April 2024, Rippling has raised a total of $1.2 billion in funding, with a recent Series F round bringing in $200 million and valuing the company at $13.5 billion [(PYMNTS, 2024-04-22)](https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2024/rippling-raises-200-million-to-enhance-workforce-management-platform/).\n\n## Recent Funding and Valuation\nRippling's Series F funding round, which closed in April 2024, was led by Coatue and included a significant secondary component allowing early investors and employees to cash out shares. The round raised $200 million in primary capital and $590 million in secondary sales, indicating strong investor confidence in the company's growth potential [(TechCrunch, 2024-04-22)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/ripplings-parker-conrad-on-the-companys-brand-new-round-its-brand-new-sf-lease-and-also-its-brand-new-critic/). This funding follows a $500 million Series E round in 2023, which valued the company at $11.25 billion [(TFN, 2024-04-18)](https://techfundingnews.com/american-hrtech-disruptor-rippling-seeks-funding-at-13-4b-valuation/).\n\n## Product Developments\nRippling's platform is continuously evolving, with recent updates enhancing user experience and functionality. Notable improvements include:\n- An upgraded search feature that allows users to navigate the platform more efficiently.\n- Enhanced mobile app navigation for easier access to employee profiles and reports.\n- Expansion of the Employer of Record (EOR) service to include hiring and payroll capabilities in Denmark, New Zealand, and Switzerland [(Rippling Team, 2024-08-23)](https://www.rippling.com/blog/august-2024-product-updates).\n\nAdditionally, Rippling has introduced a performance management tool aimed at helping employers monitor employee performance more consistently, reflecting a shift towards more stringent performance standards in the current economic climate [(HR Brew, 2024-05-08)](https://www.hr-brew.com/stories/2024/05/08/rippling-performance-management-product).\n\n## Strategic Partnerships\nRippling has established a strategic partnership with J.P. Morgan, which has been instrumental in developing a global payment ecosystem for its customers. This collaboration emphasizes Rippling's commitment to innovation and customer service, as noted by Vanessa Wu, General Counsel at Rippling, who stated, \"Every time we go to J.P. Morgan with a new product idea, the answer is not only a resounding 'Yes,' but it is, 'Yes, and here is an enterprise-grade payment solution to accomplish what you're looking for'\" [(J.P. Morgan, 2024)](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/banking/tech-banking/rippling).\n\n## Expansion Plans\nThe company is also expanding its physical presence, having signed a lease for 123,000 square feet of office space in San Francisco, which is the second-largest lease signed in the city for 2024. This expansion is expected to accommodate hundreds of new hires as Rippling continues to grow its workforce [(TechCrunch, 2024-04-22)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/ripplings-parker-conrad-on-the-companys-brand-new-round-its-brand-new-sf-lease-and-also-its-brand-new-critic/). Furthermore, Rippling is set to triple its operations in New York City, creating 390 new jobs and investing $29 million in research and development over the next decade [(Governor Hochul, 2024)](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-state-investment-tech-firm-ripplings-expansion-lower-manhattan).\n\n## Market Position and Competition\nRippling operates in a competitive landscape filled with established players like Zenefits, Paycor, Workday, and Gusto. However, Parker Conrad, CEO of Rippling, differentiates the company by emphasizing its broad product suite that integrates various business functions rather than focusing narrowly on HR alone. He stated, \"I think the way you build the best business software is to build a really broad product suite of deeply integrated and seamlessly interoperable products\" [(TechCrunch, 2024-04-22)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/ripplings-parker-conrad-on-the-companys-brand-new-round-its-brand-new-sf-lease-and-also-its-brand-new-critic/).\n\n## Executive Insights\nParker Conrad has been vocal about the company's strategy and vision. He expressed a commitment to investing heavily in research and development, stating, \"Next year, Rippling is going to spend as much on R&D as three rival companies combined\" [(TechCrunch, 2024-04-22)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/ripplings-parker-conrad-on-the-companys-brand-new-round-its-brand-new-sf-lease-and-also-its-brand-new-critic/). This focus on R&D is intended to enhance Rippling's offerings and maintain its competitive edge in the crowded HR tech market.\n\n## Conclusion\nRippling is positioned for significant growth, backed by substantial funding, strategic partnerships, and a commitment to innovation. Its comprehensive platform addresses a wide range of business needs, making it an attractive option for companies looking to streamline their HR, IT, and finance operations. As it continues to expand its product offerings and market presence, Rippling is likely to remain a key player in the workforce management sector. \n\nFor prospective candidates and investors, Rippling represents a dynamic opportunity in a rapidly evolving industry, with a strong leadership team and a clear vision for the future."
