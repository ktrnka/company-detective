The round included a significant secondary component, allowing early investors and employees to cash out some of their shares [(Loizos, TechCrunch, 2024-04-22)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/ripplings-parker-conrad-on-the-companys-brand-new-round-its-brand-new-sf-lease-and-also-its-brand-new-critic/).

This decision aligns Rippling more closely with enterprise software giants like Workday and SAP, which view payroll as a complementary offering rather than a core service [(Outsail, 2024-04-22)](https://www.outsail.co/post/hr-tech-download---april-2024). This move may position Rippling for higher-margin growth but also raises questions about its differentiation in a competitive HR tech landscape [(Outsail, 2024-04-22)](https://www.outsail.co/post/hr-tech-download---april-2024).\n\n# Additional Reading\n\n- [Rippling PEO](https://www.rippling.com/peo)\n- [Rippling Surveys](https://www.rippling.com/surveys)\n- [Rippling Accountants](https://www.rippling.com/accountants)\n- [Rippling Scheduling](https://www.rippling.com/scheduling)\n- [Rippling Integrations](https://www.rippling.com/integrations)\n- [Rippling LMS](https://www.rippling.com/lms)\n- [Rippling SUTA](https://www.rippling.com/suta)\n- [Rippling Policies](https://www.rippling.com/policies)\n- [Rippling WFA](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/wfa)\n- [Rippling 401(k)](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/401k)\n- [Rippling Payroll](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/payroll)\n- [Rippling Blog](https://www.rippling.com/blog/jpmorgan)\n- [Loizos, TechCrunch, 2024-04-22](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/ripplings-parker-conrad-on-the-companys-brand-new-round-its-brand-new-sf-lease-and-also-its-brand-new-critic/)\n- [PYMNTS, 2024-04-22](https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2024/rippling-raises-200-million-to-enhance-workforce-management-platform/)\n- [Conrad, Rippling, 2024-04-22](https://www.rippling.com/blog/rippling-announces-series-f-fundraising-and-tender-offer)\n- [D'Onfro, SFGATE, 2024-04-05](https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/tech-firm-office-space-downtown-sf-rippling-19385805.php)\n- [Governor Hochul, 2024-04-22](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-state-investment-tech-firm-ripplings-expansion-lower-manhattan)\n- [Outsail, 2024-04-22](https://www.outsail.co/post/hr-tech-download---april-2024)\n\nThis comprehensive report provides a detailed overview of Rippling, its services, key personnel, recent developments, and market position.

They spend their time understanding the business processes, decision-making, and workflows specific to what they’re building and determining which abstractions are right for supporting its most complex use cases.

Prior to starting Highnoon, he knew he wanted to stick with a platform that could automate the HR portion. Scott evaluated a few competitors, like BambooHR, but it became clear that they were missing crucial portions of what Highnoon needed, like the ability to integrate with their 401(k) and time tracking software. Scott ended up choosing Rippling for Highnoon because he was excited by the platform’s ability not only to automate HR operations, but also to handle the IT side with app and device management. “At my previous agency, we had an issue where our people operations were automated, but our technology systems weren’t,” he said. “Rippling would finally be able to solve that for us.” Implementing Rippling was seamless and took about two months. Highnoon decided to take their time with the implementation; they knew they needed payroll and benefits on day one, but everything else could come later. “We actually ended up getting much more than that on the first day of work. We were able to connect several different systems into Rippling, including our office suite and project minutes, which was great,” Scott told us.\n\nAn all-in-one system that feels like\n\nan enterprise product\n\n“With Rippling’s added layer of technology management, the platform is able to harmonize both the HR and the IT side. Rippling has also continued to mature and add new features over time; it’s an all-in-one system that feels like an enterprise product,” said Scott. “Our employees are already used to seamless and intuitive experiences in their consumer technology—so we’re happy we can match that standard with Rippling’s modern payroll and benefits platform.”\n\nScott Kaufmann\n\nOther highlights include:\n\n50% time savings with identity and device management:\n\n“By automating the technology management side, Rippling has saved us 50% more time compared to what we used at my previous agency. I love that we can provision devices with cascading permissions based on role, in addition to things like device ID tracking and managing SSO for all our different apps.\n\n10x faster employee onboarding:\n\n“At our previous company, provisioning employee devices with access was a heavy administrative burden and could take five hours. With Rippling, it takes 30 minutes at most.”\n\nIntuitive, easy-to-use payroll:\n\n“Rippling is more intuitive and easier to use than other payroll providers I’ve used, like ADP. I also appreciate their thoughtful touches that improve the employee experience, including providing digital copies of W-2s inside the Rippling portal, making them much easier to keep track of and easier for employees to access.”\n\nImproved benefits management process:\n\n“Rippling gives our employees a clear understanding of how much different insurance plans will cost, making it easy for them to be informed about which benefits to choose.”\n\n400+ integrations to help automate admin work:\n\n“It’s great that Rippling integrates with so many of our existing systems, including Cylance, a security suite that helps prevent malware and viruses.”\n\nDifferent levels of access so everyone can take care of what they need to:\n\n“Rippling provides us with just the right amount of granularity in terms of access for all of our different users. For example, we have a people ops manager and health insurance broker as admins with different levels of permissions, in addition to department leads who can manage the people processes and approvals for their teams autonomously.”",

      "# [What Is a 401(k)?](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/401k)\n401(k) vs. other investment accounts\n\nIf you’re planning for retirement, you’re probably wondering how a 401(k) compares to other investment options. The 401(k) offers unique tax advantages, particularly in how contributions and earnings are treated, which might make it a more attractive option than other accounts depending on your financial goals.\n\n401(k) vs. pension\n\nPension: A retirement plan typically funded and managed by an employer, where the employee receives a fixed monthly benefit upon retirement. The amount is usually based on salary and years of service.\n\n401(k): A defined contribution plan, meaning the employee (and sometimes the employer) contributes money into the account, but the retirement benefits depend on the investment options chosen and the account's performance.\n\nPensions provide guaranteed income. On the other hand, 401(k)s offer more flexibility and potential growth, but also come with investment risks.\n\n401(k) vs. IRA\n\nBoth 401(k)s and IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts) are tax-advantaged retirement accounts, but they differ in contribution limits, tax treatment, and eligibility.\n\nA 401(k) is typically employer-sponsored, allows higher contribution limits, and often includes employer matching contributions.\n\nAn IRA, which can be a traditional or Roth IRA, is opened independently by the individual, offering more investment options but lower contribution limits. A Roth IRA, specifically, offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, unlike a traditional 401(k), where withdrawals are taxed. The choice between a 401(k) and an IRA often depends on whether the account holder needs higher contribution limits or wants employer contributions.\n\n401(k) vs. brokerage account\n\nA brokerage account is a taxable account where you can buy and sell a wide range of investments, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Unlike a 401(k), contributions to a brokerage account are not tax-advantaged, meaning you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains each year. However, brokerage accounts offer more flexibility in terms of investment options and access to funds, making them useful for short- to medium-term financial goals, while a 401(k) is typically more suited for long-term retirement savings due to its tax benefits and penalties for early withdrawal.\n\nWho is a 401(k) for?\n\nA 401(k) is designed for employees in America who want to save for retirement while taking advantage of tax benefits. It is particularly beneficial for those whose employers offer matching contributions, as this essentially provides free money toward retirement savings.\n\nThe 401(k) is suitable for individuals who are willing to invest their contributions in a range of funds, understanding that their retirement income will depend on how their investments perform.\n\nPros and cons of a 401(k)\n\nHow does a 401(k) work?\n\nNow that you know what a 401(k) is, how does it work?\n\nA 401(k) is a retirement savings plan that allows employees to contribute a portion of their salary into a tax-advantaged account, often with matching employer contributions. This type of plan is known as a defined contribution plan, meaning that the retirement benefits are based on the amount contributed and the performance of the investments chosen.\n\nAmericans use 401(k) plans as a primary method for building retirement savings, typically through employer-sponsored programs. Depending on the type of plan, employee contributions can be made on a pre-tax basis, meaning they reduce the employee’s taxable income for the year. The contributions then grow tax-deferred, with taxes paid only upon withdrawal in retirement.\n\nEmployer contributions to your 401(k) may be subject to a vesting schedule, meaning you need to remain employed with the company for a certain period before you fully own those contributions.\n\nWhat is a traditional 401(k)?\n\nA traditional 401(k) is a type of retirement savings account where contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your current taxable income. The funds grow tax-deferred, and you pay income tax on withdrawals during retirement.\n\nPlan contribution limits: For 2024, the annual contribution limit is $23,000 for individuals under 50. Those 50 and older can make an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500, for a total annual contribution of $30,500.\n\nEmployer matching: Cannot exceed the lesser of $69,000 for individuals under 50 (pr $76,500 for those 50 and up) or 100% of the employee’s annual compensation.\n\nRequired minimum distributions (RMDs): Once you reach age 73, you are required to start taking minimum distributions from your traditional 401(k) each year. The amount is calculated based on your life expectancy.\n\nPros and cons of a traditional 401(k)\n\nWhat is a Roth 401(k)?\n\nA Roth 401(k) is similar to a traditional 401(k) but with a key difference in tax treatment. Contributions to a Roth 401(k) are made with after-tax dollars, meaning they do not reduce your current taxable income. However, withdrawals during retirement are tax-free, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nPlan contribution limits: For 2024, the annual contribution limit is $23,000 for individuals under 50. Those 50 and older can make an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500, for a total annual contribution of $30,500.\n\nEmployer matching: Cannot exceed the lesser of $69,000 for individuals under 50 (pr $76,500 for those 50 and up) or 100% of the employee’s annual compensation.\n\nRequired minimum distributions (RMDs): None.\n\nPros and cons of a Roth 401(k)\n\nHow do you start a 401(k)?\n\nIndividuals generally can’t start a 401(k) on their own—you need to enroll in your employer’s retirement plan during the onboarding process or an open enrollment period. Eligibility requirements vary by employer, but most plans allow employees to begin contributing once they have met certain employment criteria, such as a specific length of service.\n\nTo enroll, you’ll need to fill out the necessary forms provided by your employer, choose your contribution rate, and select your investment options from those offered within the plan.\n\nHow does a 401(k) earn money?\n\nA 401(k) earns money through the growth of the investments chosen by the plan participants.\n\nThese can include:\n\nMutual funds\n\nTarget date funds\n\nStocks\n\nBonds\n\nOther securities\n\nThe account balance grows over time as the account investments generate returns, such as dividends or capital gains. The specific investment strategy you choose, based on your risk tolerance and retirement goals, will influence how much your 401(k) earns. Diversified investments can help manage risk and maximize growth potential over the long term.\n\nHow and when do you withdraw from a 401(k)?\n\nWithdrawals from a 401(k) are, as a rule, only allowed once the account owner reaches age 59½, though plan participants may take early withdrawals under certain conditions—often with penalties.\n\nQualified distributions from traditional 401(k) accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified distributions from Roth accounts are tax-free.\n\nAll IRS rules about 401(k) distributions (and their tax treatment) can be found in Publication 575, Pension and Annuity Income.\n\nFrequently asked questions about 401(k)s\n\nStill have questions about 401(k)s? Learn more in the FAQs below.\n\nCan you take early withdrawals from a 401(k)?\n\nYou can take early withdrawals from a 401(k), but it’s important to understand the potential penalties and tax implications. Generally, withdrawing funds before age 59½ will result in a 10% early withdrawal penalty in addition to the regular income tax on the withdrawn amount. However, there are exceptions for specific circumstances, such as a hardship withdrawal, which may allow you to avoid the penalty but still require you to pay income taxes on the amount. Consulting with a financial advisor before taking an early withdrawal can help you understand your options and minimize financial consequences.\n\nWhat happens to your 401(k) if you leave your job?\n\nIf you leave your job, you have several options for your 401(k). You can leave the funds in your former employer’s plan, if allowed, or you can roll over the balance into a new employer’s 401(k) plan or an IRA. Rolling over your 401(k) can help you consolidate your retirement savings and maintain control over your investments, but it’s important to handle the rollover process correctly to avoid taxes and penalties.\n\nAre 401(k)s taxed?\n\nIf you have a traditional 401(k), you make pre-tax contributions, allowing your investments to grow until you withdraw them in retirement (also known as tax deferral). Upon withdrawal, the funds are taxed as ordinary income.\n\nIf you have a Roth 401(k), contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so withdrawals during retirement are tax-free, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nWhat is a solo 401(k)?\n\nA Solo 401(k) is a retirement savings plan designed for self-employed individuals or small business owners with no full-time employees other than the business owner and their spouse. This plan allows for higher contribution limits than traditional 401(k) plans because the business owner can contribute both as an employer and an employee. A Solo 401(k) can be an excellent option for small business owners looking to maximize their retirement savings.",
      "# [What Is Payroll?](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/payroll)\nWhat payroll entails\n\nThe key purpose of payroll is to make sure your employees are paid accurately and on time while complying with various legal requirements. More specifically, that means:\n\nCalculating wages\n\nDetermine the correct amount of pay for each employee based on their hours worked, salary, wage, or commission structure. This also includes accounting for overtime, bonuses, and any other compensation.\n\nCalculating and filing taxes\n\nCalculate, withhold, and remit the correct taxes, which can include federal, state, and local taxes, depending on where your business and your employee(s) are located. Employers are required to file payroll taxes with the appropriate agencies and provide employees with the necessary tax documents by the correct deadlines.\n\nCompliance\n\nAdhere to federal, state, and local labor and employment laws, including minimum wage requirements, overtime pay regulations, workers’ compensation enrollment, and proper classification of employees and independent contractors. It’s up to employers to stay up-to-date on these laws and any changes to legislation to avoid potential penalties.\n\nRecordkeeping\n\nMaintain accurate records of employee hours, wages, tax withholdings, and other payroll-related information. These records are important to have on hand for tax filings and in case you get audited or need to resolve any payroll disputes.\n\nRunning payroll: 2 methods\n\nThere are two primary methods for running payroll: manually calculating payroll or using a payroll system. Each method has its own benefits and considerations, which we’ll explore in more detail below.\n\nCalculating payroll manually\n\nCalculating payroll manually involves using spreadsheets or other manual methods to track employee hours, calculate wages, and determine tax withholdings. This method is most often used by small businesses with a limited number of employees.\n\nHow to run payroll manually\n\nGather employee information. Collect necessary payroll information such as hours worked, salary rates, and any bonuses or commissions.\n\nReview and approve time sheets. If your employees are paid hourly and not salaried, review their time sheets and compare them to employee schedules to check for errors.\n\nCalculate gross pay. Multiply the hours worked by the hourly rate, or use the salary amount, adding any bonuses or commissions.\n\nCalculate and withhold income taxes. Calculate income tax withholdings (federal, state, and local, if applicable based on where the employee lives and their allowances. You can use the IRS Withholding Estimator to determine how much to withhold for federal income tax, and check with your employee’s state tax assessor’s office for the correct state income tax withholding rate, if they have a state income tax.\n\nCalculate other deductions. Calculate Social Security taxes, Medicare, federal and state unemployment taxes, and any other payroll deductions (e.g., retirement plan contributions, health insurance).\n\nCalculate net pay. Subtract the total deductions from the gross pay to determine the net pay.\n\nPay employees. Issue payments to employees each payday. You can pay them via paper checks, by direct deposit into their bank accounts, or by whatever payment method you mutually agree upon.\n\nRecordkeeping. Maintain accurate records of all payroll calculations and payments, and give pay stubs to employees for their own records.\n\nUsing a payroll system\n\nA payroll system automates the payroll process, reducing the risk of errors and saving time. Payroll systems can handle calculations, tax filings, direct deposits, and recordkeeping. Some even have time tracking, employee benefits like PTO and sick time, integrations with accounting software, garnishments, and other convenient features that make payroll easier for everyone from startups to small business owners to enterprise companies.\n\nTypes of payroll systems\n\nThere are several different types of payroll systems businesses can choose from, based on their needs and resources.\n\nProfessional payroll services\n\nProfessional payroll services provide full-service solutions for managing payroll, which can be a good choice for businesses that either don’t have a full human resources team, or have limited in-house HR resources.\n\nBy outsourcing payroll to a professional service, businesses can have a complete hands-off experience that includes all aspects of payroll processing: wage calculations, deductions, direct deposits, and generating payroll reports. Additionally, full-service payroll providers often offer HR support, such as managing employee benefits, handling workers' comp, and assisting with compliance, giving your business more flexibility to focus on its core operations.\n\nPayroll software\n\nPayroll software allows businesses to manage payroll in-house using automated tools. These modern payroll solutions can typically handle calculations, tax filings, and direct deposits, giving businesses flexibility and control while saving them time and effort.\n\nHybrid payroll systems\n\nHybrid payroll systems combine elements of both professional services and payroll software. Businesses can use software for routine tasks while relying on professional services for complex issues or compliance support.\n\nHow to choose a payroll system\n\nWhen choosing a payroll system, consider factors such as the size of your business, your budget, the complexity of your payroll needs, and the level of expertise you need to manage your payroll. Carefully evaluate the features, costs, and support options of different systems to find the best fit for your business.\n\nWhat to consider when selecting a payroll system\n\n1. Your business needs\n\nSize of your business: Small businesses might benefit from simple, self-service payroll solutions, while larger organizations may require comprehensive, full-service options.\n\nComplexity of your payroll needs: Consider the complexity of your payroll needs, such as multiple pay rates, bonuses, commissions, and overtime calculations.\n\n2. Payroll providers\n\nReputation and reliability: Research payroll providers and read reviews to make sure they have a good track record of reliability and customer satisfaction.\n\nServices offered: Look for providers that offer the payroll management features you need, like tax filing, compliance, or human resources support.\n\n3. Pricing\n\nCost structure: Understand the pricing model of each payroll provider or software. Some charge a flat fee per month, while others may charge per payroll run or per employee you onboard.\n\nHidden fees: Be aware of any additional costs, such as fees for tax filing, direct deposits, or customer support.\n\n4. Integrations\n\nAccounting software: Does the payroll system integrate with your existing accounting software?\n\nTime tracking systems: If the payroll software doesn’t offer time tracking as a feature, make sure it integrates with a time tracking system to automate the process of calculating hours worked.\n\n5. User experience\n\nIntuitive interface: The payroll system should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for your HR team to navigate and use.\n\nSelf-service options: Self-service features, like an app or employee dashboard, allow employees to access their pay stubs and tax forms, and update personal information without needing HR intervention.\n\n6. Customer support\n\nAvailability: See if the payroll provider offers reliable customer support to assist with any issues or questions that may arise.\n\nResources: Look for additional resources such as training materials, webinars, and tutorials to help your team get the most out of the system.\n\nPayroll taxes\n\nPayroll taxes are the mandatory contributions that employers and employees make to fund various government programs. It’s usually up to employers to deduct them from employees’ paychecks and file and pay them on employees’ behalf. Here’s a breakdown of the different types of payroll taxes you’ll need to know.\n\nFICA taxes\n\nFICA, a type of federal tax, includes Social Security and Medicare. Both employers and employees contribute to these taxes. The current rates are 6.2% for Social Security and 1.45% for Medicare, with employers matching these contributions.\n\nUnemployment taxes\n\nUnemployment taxes fund state and federal unemployment insurance programs. Employers are responsible for paying these taxes, which vary based on the state and the employer's experience rating.\n\nIncome taxes\n\nIncome taxes are withheld from employees' wages and paid to federal, state, and local tax authorities. Employers must accurately calculate and withhold these taxes based on employees' earnings and tax withholdings.\n\nFrequently asked questions about payroll\n\nStill have questions about payroll? Learn more in the FAQs below.\n\nWhat is the difference between gross pay and net pay?\n\nGross pay is the total amount of money earned by an employee before any deductions, such as taxes, health insurance, and retirement contributions. Net pay is the amount of money an employee takes home after all deductions have been subtracted from the gross pay.\n\nHow often should payroll be processed?\n\nPayroll can be processed on various schedules, including weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly. The frequency depends on the employer's policies and the nature of the business. Consistency in payroll runs helps ensure timely payment to employees and compliance with labor laws.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using a payroll service provider?\n\nUsing a payroll service provider can save time and reduce errors by automating payroll calculations, tax filings, and compliance tasks. It also ensures that payroll is processed accurately and on time, helps maintain compliance with labor laws, and provides support for human resources functions.\n\nHow do payroll systems integrate with accounting software?\n\nPayroll systems can integrate with accounting software to streamline financial management. This integration allows for automatic synchronization of payroll data with the company's general ledger, reducing the need for manual data entry and minimizing the risk of errors.\n\nWhy is payroll tax compliance important?\n\nPayroll tax compliance is crucial to avoid legal penalties and fines. Employers must accurately calculate, withhold, and remit federal, state, and local taxes. Compliance with tax regulations ensures that employees receive accurate tax forms and that the business adheres to legal requirements.\n\nWhat are the potential penalties for payroll errors?\n\nPenalties for payroll errors can include fines, interest on unpaid taxes, and legal action. Errors such as incorrect tax withholdings, late tax payments, or misclassification of employees can result in significant financial and legal consequences for the business.",
      "# [Commitment to clients by The Rippling Team on 2024-04-03](https://www.rippling.com/blog/jpmorgan)\nOn March 9, 2023, in response to a regional banking crisis, the FDIC froze the accounts of Silicon Valley Bank, Rippling's then-financial services provider, and the clock was ticking to get clients the money they needed to pay their employees. Without hesitation, Rippling authorized the release of $130 million of the company’s own capital as a stopgap, but there was still the matter of actually issuing the payments. Thankfully Rippling had a contingency plan in place, which included an existing partnership with J.P. Morgan. Together, Rippling and J.P. Morgan established secure payment rails, beat the clock, and paid everyone on time.\n\nThe process of moving money across international borders for payroll and other transactions involves navigating myriad country-specific regulations and banking systems, each with its own unique requirements for currency exchange and tax compliance. This complexity necessitates a banking partner that can provide extensive global coverage and a sophisticated suite of services to handle the intricacies of navigating international payments.

      "# [What Is Overtime?](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/overtime)\nWhat are overtime hours?\n\nOvertime hours refer to any hours worked by an employee beyond their standard work schedule. In most cases, this is defined as working more than 40 hours in a single workweek. Some industries or employers might have different thresholds for overtime, such as daily overtime for working more than 8 hours in a day, depending on local labor laws and company policies.\n\nWhat is overtime pay?\n\nOvertime pay is the additional compensation qualifying employees receive for working overtime hours. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is an American law that mandates that non-exempt employees must be paid at least one and a half times their regular hourly rate for any hours worked over 40 in a workweek. This higher rate is commonly referred to as \"time and a half.\"\n\nWho is eligible for overtime pay?\n\nEligibility for overtime pay depends on the employee's classification under overtime laws, most notably the FLSA.\n\nExempt employees\n\nExempt employees are typically not eligible for overtime pay (or minimum wage). These employees fall into categories such as executive, administrative, professional, outside sales, and certain computer employees. To qualify as exempt, these employees must meet specific criteria regarding their job duties and receive a salary that meets or exceeds a certain threshold set by the Department of Labor. The FLSA also doesn’t require agricultural workers to receive overtime pay.\n\nNon-exempt employees\n\nNon-exempt employees are eligible for overtime pay. These employees are usually paid on an hourly basis and do not meet the exemption criteria. Non-exempt employees must receive overtime pay at a rate of at least one and a half times their regular hourly wage for any hours worked over 40 in a workweek.\n\nIndependent contractors\n\nIndependent contractors are not eligible for overtime pay under the FLSA. They are considered self-employed and are typically paid per project or assignment rather than by the hour. As such, they are responsible for negotiating their rates and managing their work hours.\n\nHow to calculate overtime pay\n\nCalculating overtime pay is usually pretty straightforward:\n\nDetermine the employee’s regular rate of pay: Identify the employee's regular hourly wage. For salaried employees, divide their weekly salary by the number of hours they are expected to work per week (typically 40 hours).\n\nCalculate the overtime rate: Multiply the regular hourly rate by 1.5 to find the overtime rate. For example, if the regular hourly rate is $20, the overtime rate would be $20x1.5, or $30.\n\nCalculate how many overtime hours the employee worked: Determine the number of hours of overtime worked. This is the total hours worked in the week minus 40 hours.\n\nCalculate the employee’s overtime pay: Multiply the overtime hours by the overtime rate. For example, if an employee worked 45 hours in a week with a regular hourly rate of $20, the calculation would be:\n\nOvertime hours = 45-40 = 5 hours\n\nOvertime pay = 5 hours x $30 (overtime rate) = $150\n\nCalculate the employee’s total pay: Add the regular pay and the overtime pay. For the example above:\n\nRegular pay = 40 hours x $20 (regular pay rate) = $800\n\nOvertime pay = $150\n\nTotal pay = $800 + $150 = $950\n\nState laws regarding overtime\n\nWhile the FLSA covers all of America, states have made their own laws to increase protections or make more specific rules about who is eligible for overtime pay and when.\n\nCalifornia has the strictest overtime laws, requiring employers to pay double an employee’s regular pay rate if they work more than 12 hours in a day or more than eight hours on their seventh consecutive day of work.\n\nThese states have daily overtime rules:\n\nAlaska: 1.5 times the regular pay rate if an employee works more than eight hours in a day.\n\nCalifornia: 1.5 times the regular pay rate if an employee works more than eight hours in a day.\n\nColorado: 1.5 times the regular pay rate if an employee works more than 12 hours in a day or 12 consecutive hours.\n\nFlorida: Overtime pay is required for manual laborers who work more than 10 hours in a day.\n\nNevada: 1.5 times the regular pay rate if an employee works more than eight hours in a day and earns less than 1.5 times the minimum wage.\n\nOregon: 1.5 times the regular pay rate if an employee works more than 10 hours a day in mill, factory, or manufacturing jobs, or eight hours a day in timber jobs.\n\nFrequently asked questions about overtime\n\nWhat counts as overtime hours?\n\nOvertime hours typically refer to any hours worked beyond the standard 40-hour workweek. However, some states or employers may have different thresholds, such as requiring overtime pay for hours worked over 8 in a single day. It’s important to check local labor laws and company policies for specific definitions of overtime hours.\n\nAre salaried employees eligible for overtime pay?\n\nNot all salaried employees are exempt from overtime. Eligibility depends on the specific job duties and salary level. Exempt employees, such as those in executive, administrative, or professional roles, generally don’t qualify for overtime pay.\n\nHow do nondiscretionary bonuses affect overtime pay?\n\nNondiscretionary bonuses are bonuses that are promised or expected as part of an employee’s compensation. These bonuses are included in the calculation of the regular rate of pay, but under the FLSA, they don’t count toward determining overtime pay.\n\nDo part-time employees receive overtime pay?\n\nPart-time employees are entitled to overtime pay if they work more than 40 hours in a workweek.

      "# [What Is an Applicant Tracking System (ATS)?](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/ats)\nHow do applicant tracking systems work?\n\nApplicant tracking systems (ATS) are software solutions designed to streamline the recruitment process by helping hiring teams manage and organize candidate information.\n\nApplicant tracking software is typically cloud-based. These platforms allow recruiters and HR professionals to store and track candidate information, like resumes, cover letters, and job applications, in one centralized location. By automating many aspects of the hiring process, an ATS helps companies quickly identify the best candidates and attract top talent in their fields.\n\nThe system works by analyzing resumes and applications, comparing them to job descriptions, and ranking candidates based on how well they meet the criteria for open positions. Talent acquisition teams can then use the ATS to manage candidate communication, schedule interviews, and track each applicant’s progress through the hiring pipeline.\n\nSome ATS systems also generate reports and real-time analytics to help companies optimize their recruitment strategies.\n\nHow do employers use applicant tracking systems to find candidates?\n\nEmployers use applicant tracking systems to streamline the process of finding and hiring the right candidates. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how ATS can be used to recruit new hires:\n\nCreating and posting job listings. Employers start by creating job postings within the ATS. The system makes it easier to distribute job listings across multiple job boards, career sites, and social media platforms like LinkedIn, so they can reach a broader audience and attract a larger pool of candidates.\n\nCollecting applications. As candidates apply, the ATS automatically collects their information. The system then parses resumes and organizes them into candidate profiles, making it easier for hiring managers and human resources teams to review applications.\n\nScreening and assessing candidates. ATS systems often come with tools for initial candidate assessments, which can include keyword searches that match resumes against job requirements, or scoring algorithms that rank candidates based on their qualifications.\n\nManaging communication. Throughout the process, the ATS helps manage communication with candidates. Automated messaging features can be used to send updates, schedule interviews, and keep candidates engaged and informed.\n\nTracking progress. The ATS allows hiring teams to track each candidate's progress through the recruitment pipeline, from the application stage to sending offer letters. The system also facilitates team collaboration by allowing hiring managers and HR to share notes and feedback on each candidate.\n\nOnboarding. Once a candidate is selected, the ATS should, ideally, assist with the onboarding process by making sure you already have a head start on gathering your new hire’s information and documentation.\n\nWhat features should an applicant tracking system have?\n\nWhen selecting an applicant tracking system, look for features that will support and improve every part of your recruitment process. Here are some key features to look for:\n\nHeadcount planning you can sync across your organization\n\nJob description templates you can customize\n\nJob posting across multiple job boards and career sites\n\nEmployee referrals and referral management\n\nResume parsing for efficient candidate screening\n\nCandidate assessments and scoring algorithms\n\nInterview scheduling tools to coordinate with candidates and hiring teams\n\nMessaging for candidate communication\n\nAutomated workflows to eliminate time-consuming administrative work (like re-entering candidate information at different steps)\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) features to optimize candidate matching\n\nData and metrics for tracking recruitment performance\n\nMany modern recruiting teams consider ATS software to be one of their most essential tools. By automating the process of tracking and screening applicants, an ATS helps companies focus on finding the most qualified candidates for their job openings.\n\nFor candidates\n\nATS solutions offer both advantages and drawbacks for job seekers:\n\nFor recruiters\n\nSimilarly, ATS software provides benefits and drawbacks for recruiting teams:\n\nHow to choose an applicant tracking system\n\nWhen selecting recruiting software, look for a solution that aligns with your organization's needs and your overall hiring strategy. The steps below should help you get started.\n\n1. Assess your needs\n\nBefore choosing an ATS, thoroughly evaluate your organization’s needs.\n\nGather input from key stakeholders within the HR and recruitment teams, as well as other departments that may interact with the system. Understanding the unique challenges your company faces in recruitment will help you identify the most important features you need in an ATS. Keep in mind that selecting and implementing an ATS can be time-consuming, so it’s important to choose a system that meets both your immediate and long-term needs.\n\n2. Set a budget\n\nConsider the pricing of different ATS options and how they fit within your company’s financial constraints. Weigh the cost of the software against the potential return on investment, such as improved efficiency and reduced time-to-hire.\n\n3. Review options\n\nOnce you have assessed your needs and set a budget, you’re ready to start reviewing your options.\n\nLook for a system that offers functionality that aligns with your recruitment goals and offers these key features:\n\nIntegrations with other tools in your HR tech stack, like your HRIS or HCM software, background check software, or talent management platform\n\nEase of use, so it doesn’t require extensive training or have a high learning curve for different team members in your organization to use it\n\nHolistic improvement across your entire recruitment process, including the candidate experience. The goal is for your ATS software to make recruitment better for your employees and candidates, so a good user experience from both sides is key.\n\nFrequently asked questions about applicant tracking systems\n\nStill have questions about ATS providers? Learn more in the FAQs below.\n\nWhat’s the difference between an ATS and a CRM?\n\nAn Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is primarily used to manage the recruitment process, from posting jobs to tracking applications and managing candidate information. A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, on the other hand, is designed to manage interactions with clients or customers. In recruitment, a CRM can be used to build and maintain relationships with passive candidates, nurture talent pools, and engage potential hires over time, complementing the functions of an ATS.\n\nCan an ATS help with diversity hiring initiatives?\n\nYes, many ATS platforms include features that support diversity hiring initiatives, like blind recruitment tools that remove identifying information from resumes and analytics to track diversity metrics.\n\nIs an ATS suitable for small businesses?\n\nYes, an ATS can be beneficial for small businesses by helping to streamline the recruitment process, save time, and improve candidate management. Many ATS providers offer scalable solutions with flexible pricing, making them accessible to small businesses with varying recruitment needs.",
      "# [How NuvoAir doubled its global workforce while reducing onboarding time](https://www.rippling.com/customers/nuvoair)\nNuvoAir was founded in Stockholm, Sweden but sought to break into the North American healthcare market. Expansion meant hiring more US and Canadian employees, which initially involved dealing with a hodgepodge of payroll and employee management tools that weren’t cohesive.\n\n“We had people on Gusto and then on a different payroll software in Europe,” said Val Anselmi, NuvoAir’s People Ops Specialist, before adding that she manually updated spreadsheets to corral her team’s data, which was spread across multiple systems. “We used Google Drive to store documents. It was very scrappy.”\n\nNuvoAir hired its first Canadian employees through an EOR provider, but grew frustrated with its limitations, including glacial onboarding times. According to Val, the whole process happened over email and there could be a hold-up at every step. She spent longer than she wanted waiting to get employee agreements, approve them, and get new hires to sign them. “Because there’s so much back and forth, they tell you to plan at least two weeks for onboarding,” she said.\n\nVal also had to submit a ticket with support to make any changes to employee data or payroll, such as when supervisors gave raises. She often waited five to seven business days to get any changes approved. “We had no visibility whatsoever in terms of payroll changes,” she said.\n\nAs NuvoAir scaled, its People Ops Specialist sought a single source of truth for her global team—without bloating its administrative staff.\n\nNuvoAir first started using Rippling in 2021, when the company wanted a PEO for its US employees to replace its existing system, Gusto. Once they implemented it, they realized it was also the perfect HR platform for their European and Canadian employees, so they switched them over, too.\n\n01\n\nManaging all employees under the same roof\n\nWith Rippling, NuvoAir’s entire global workforce receives offer letters, completes training, and requests time off through a single software solution.\n\n“We use Rippling as a centralized source of truth so that we can keep track of everyone’s compensation, onboarding, and offboarding information,” Val said. “We love to have everyone in one spot instead of across different software. It’s so much better than other systems. Even just for benefits and compensation, there’s so much visibility Rippling offers that other companies don’t.”\n\nVal appreciates that Rippling allows her to store data on her employees’ profiles, enroll them in benefits, send updated documents, sync their time off with their managers, and more. She also said NuvoAir’s employees prefer using Rippling for all HR functions—from onboarding to offboarding—instead of constantly toggling between platforms.\n\n02\n\nA better solution for Canadian employees\n\nThe second Val heard Rippling launched its EOR service, NuvoAir switched all its Canadian EOR employees over to Rippling. The company immediately saved on costs by paying only two-thirds of the price, all while gaining more control over payroll changes and reducing onboarding times by 90%. With NuvoAir’s Canadian employees managed and paid through Rippling EOR, “It feels way more like they’re part of the same company, versus having them on another platform,” Val said. “From a software and benefit perspective, they just go through the same workflow that everyone else goes through.”\n\nVal said it takes 20 to 30 minutes to go through the Rippling onboarding workflow. Including getting the new hire to sign an offer letter, she can typically wrap up onboarding within two days.\n\nI don’t feel the difference between when I hire a global employee through Rippling EOR versus when I hire them directly in the US.\n\nVal Anselmi\n\nPeople Ops Specialist at NuvoAir\n\n03\n\nGlobal expansion, without a bloated HR staff\n\nBefore using Rippling products, NuvoAir had 35 employees. Since switching to Rippling, the staff has grown to 75, with a workforce spread throughout Europe and North America. The company also followed through on its aim to expand into the US healthcare market, switching its headquarters from Stockholm to Boston. It also quadrupled its engineering staff.\n\nAnd NuvoAir did it all while maintaining a lean, two-person HR staff.\n\nVal said that Rippling lets her team automate processes instead of hiring more HR employees, helping the company save money and focus on scaling its business. By using Rippling PEO and EOR, the company offloads complicated HR tasks related to compliance, benefits administration, payroll, and taxes in most of the countries where NuvoAir employees live.\n\n04\n\nHigh-visibility reports and custom workflows\n\nNuvoAir’s HR and finance teams use Rippling’s deep well of features to save time and make smart, data-backed decisions. Using Rippling’s reports, HR gives metrics to the board once a month on headcount,attrition rate, and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives.\n\nThe company also uses custom fields to track employees’ dietary restrictions for in-person events, emergency contacts, work equipment preferences, and equity grants (which became a lot easier after ditching manual spreadsheets).\n\nRippling looks like an HR software designed to make HR people’s lives 10 times easier. It saves a huge amount of time.\n\nVal Anselmi\n\nPeople Ops Specialist at NuvoAir\n\nVal also appreciates Rippling’s finer details that speed up her workday. She likes how time-off requests automatically appear as invites on managers’ calendars, so they know when people are on vacation. She also likes how she can instantly find an employee’s tenure on their profile.",
      "# [Harver doubles its candidate management efficiency with Rippling Recruiting](https://www.rippling.com/customers/harver)\nHarver helped hundreds of clients use data to make faster, better hiring decisions. But after undergoing a large-scale acquisition and rebrand, the company assessed its own talent search methods and found its recruiting software could use an update.\n\n“We wanted to reduce cost on all fronts,” said Fariha Samad, Harver’s Global Talent Acquisition Manager. “The motto we ran with was ‘operational efficiency’—doing better with less.”\n\nThat first meant consolidating Harver’s HR tech stack, going from 10 vendors to just a single solution—Rippling. And while Harver still used the same ATS, Fariha wanted a more cost-effective recruiting solution to better integrate with its new HR systems.\n\nAs the sole person overseeing Harver’s recruiting efforts, Fariha drained hours of her packed schedule doing manual work caused by the old ATS’s lack of integration with other tools: posting job descriptions, re-entering data across multiple systems, and nudging hiring managers to submit feedback after interviewing candidates. Recruiters also hit roadblocks learning how to effectively use the ATS and properly configure its workflows.\n\nAfter looking at several other solutions, Harver chose Rippling Recruiting as their new ATS.\n\n“Rippling came at a much lighter price tag, felt easy enough for hiring managers to use, and had a much better interface than what we had before,” Fariha said. “Going back to the motto of ‘operational efficiency,’ it made the most sense to reduce our HR tech stack to one system.”\n\n01\n\nNew jobs posted and filled—in a fraction of the time\n\nInstead of using a patchwork of different systems, Fariha now uses Rippling Recruiting to quickly open and post new roles, tag hiring managers (who all had existing Rippling profiles) to alert them of resumes, and schedule calls for interviews.\n\nOnce Fariha’s team lands on an applicant they’d like to hire, Rippling automatically fills the candidate’s information into an offer letter—without anyone needing to manually input any data. From there, candidates who accept the offer are automatically converted into employees.\n\n02\n\nBetter candidate feedback\n\nFariha also uses Rippling Recruiting to collect candidate feedback. “It works beautifully now because Rippling is the one chasing hiring managers instead of me because they get an automated reminder to submit feedback every day.”\n\nAnd the recruiters have an easier time collaborating—Fariha appreciates the platform’s comments box, where authorized hiring managers can tag and discuss candidates. She also likes Rippling Recruiting’s AI-rendered summaries comparing feedback reports from different interviewers.\n\n03\n\nTight integration of all employee data\n\nNow, all of Harver’s recruiting and HR functions coexist under the same solution. Harver’s new ATS seamlessly syncs with its other Rippling products, all of which are built on top of a single source of truth for employee data, making it easy to report on who’s joining and leaving the company.",

      "# [Frogslayer’s IT department onboards employees three times faster with Rippling](https://www.rippling.com/customers/frogslayer)\nWhen Frogslayer first started, managing devices was slow, time-consuming, and error-prone. A member of the IT team had to purchase machines, manually set up software, and ship them to employees.\n\nAs the company scaled, it became clear that these inefficient processes would waste more and more of IT’s time and give new employees a slow start.\n\n“I’ve spent a lot of my IT career moving organizations out of firefighting mode,” said Brian Cahill, Frogslayer’s Head of IT. “I like researching and implementing new things, and finding the next cool new technology.”\n\nBrian needed to automate manual processes, from onboarding new employees to remotely managing their devices, without increasing headcount or diluting the quality of the employee experience.\n\nBy rolling out Rippling’s app and device management, Frogslayer eliminated manual processes, resulting in fewer open tickets and no need to grow their IT team.\n\n01\n\nAutomated device management\n\nFrogslayer rolled out Ripping’s app management and device management, and migrated their single sign-on (SSO) and devices into it.\n\nSince deploying Rippling, there are fewer tickets, so IT staff spend less time creating accounts and setting up devices. Brian and his team have more time to focus on their most strategic work.\n\nWith Rippling, IT and HR are in the same system, which means no more typos on first name and last name. No more ‘my signature’s off because somebody typed my job title wrong.\n\nBrian Cahill\n\nHead of IT at Frogslayer\n\nBrian is no longer surprised when HR hires new employees—he is able to purchase new devices well in advance of them joining and ensure a new employee hiring experience that is smooth, timely, and easy to customize.\n\n“Each time we roll out new software I am impressed by how easy Rippling makes the integration process,” said Brian. “Rippling is constantly improving and releasing new features each month, and I’m always looking forward to the next innovation.”\n\n02\n\nCutting out cumbersome onboarding tasks\n\nFrogslayer’s HR, IT, and admin staff no longer have to waste hours going through every onboarding task.\n\n“Employee downtime is lower because my technician is spending more time on tech support and less time on manual onboarding steps,” said Brian.\n\nOffboarding is more fully integrated, too. Azure AD only went as far as switching off a user’s authentication, whereas Rippling goes in and changes account details, like removing licenses.\n\nWe used to have a list we would spin up for every new employee, with 30 things we have to get done. With Rippling, that list is now gone.\n\nBrian Cahill\n\nHead of IT at Frogslayer\n\n03\n\nOne platform to rule them all\n\nBrian found that Rippling did everything the company previously used Microsoft for, with one crucial advantage: Rippling’s IT products are tightly integrated with the HR system.\n\nFrogslayer also needed LDAP to authenticate internal apps and RADIUS for WiFi authentication. Both of these came with Rippling and were easy to configure—unlike Microsoft, which requires standing up separate servers.\n\n04\n\nQuick and painless rollout\n\nWith some careful planning and implementation, and the fact Rippling was easy to configure, users didn’t notice a thing. And because Rippling configuration is simple to understand, Brian could save even more time: “You don’t have to create a wiki page, or a doc that says ‘here’s how to create a user in the system.’”",
      "# [Sitemate](https://www.rippling.com/customers/sitemate)\nWhile Sitemate was busy helping industrial workers and companies streamline their processes and digitize their information, its own operations flow left a lot to be desired.\n\nThe industrial software company relied on a tangle of spreadsheets, emails, and Slack messages to manage its HR needs. Processes were highly manual—to request time off, employees would email their manager, who in turn would email someone in accounting, who’d then add it to Xero.\n\nBut as Sitemate expanded from its headquarters in Sydney to London, Vancouver, and other global markets, Sitemate turned its attention to internal processes and saw an opportunity.\n\n\"We didn't have an HRIS system in place, so the operations team was fielding a lot of noise, a lot of 'what do I do' questions,\" said Annabel Tomlin, Sitemate’s VP of Operations. It was time for a change. Founder and CEO Hartley Pike went in search of a new solution.\n\nSitemate found Rippling, which revitalized the company’s workforce management processes and fit its needs like a glove.\n\n01\n\nA massive time-saver\n\n“Rippling just makes it so much easier and more efficient for everybody,” Annabel said. “It’s saved us so much time.”\n\nAll Sitemate employees are now onboarded through Rippling, a process that’s become a snap. And employees have “found it really useful and easy to use,” said Annabel. “The experience has been super positive.”\n\nSitemate managers are especially keen on the approvals app, which Annabel said is “a real game-changer.”\n\n“That’s been really awesome to have.

It’s saved us so much time\n\nAnnabel Tomlin\n\nVP of Operations at Sitemate\n\n02\n\nA single source of truth—with powerful reporting capabilities\n\nWith Rippling, Sitemate finally had a platform that could house all of its data. “Having it all in one place is very handy,” as Annabel puts it. With one unified platform, the company can access powerful insights to share with key audiences.\n\n“It’s been handy in the recruitment process,” Annabel said, “being able to genuinely look at the makeup of our team and answer that question when someone asks, ‘How diverse is your team?’ I can actually pull the numbers and provide that information to hiring managers.”\n\nIn a similar vein, Sitemate now has a much clearer view of salary bands and compensation trends—and they can share critical data with the board and investors with confidence.\n\n03\n\nSOC 2 certification achieved\n\nWith Rippling’s app and device management, Sitemate successfully got its SOC 2 certification.\n\n04\n\nSupport during global growth\n\nAs a multinational company that’s continually expanding across the globe, Sitemate’s complex needs are being met by Rippling. Hartley describes Rippling’s ability to scale policies globally as “priceless.”\n\nAnd what’s really delighted Annabel and her team: Rippling is growing and evolving along with them.\n\n“We’ve laughed sometimes because we talk about needing to improve this process, and then we get an email from Rippling saying, ‘We’ve got this new app! Do you need this?’ And then we’re like, oh my God, yeah, just what we needed! You guys have thought of everything that we need.”",
      "# [What Is Work From Anywhere (WFA)?](https://www.rippling.com/glossary/wfa)\nWork from anywhere (WFA) vs remote work\n\nWhile both WFA and remote work offer flexibility and the terms are often used interchangeably, there are key differences between them:\n\nRemote work: Having a remote job typically means working from a fixed remote location, such as a home office. It often implies some geographic limitation, like working within the same country or time zone.\n\nWFA: Work from anywhere jobs allow employees to work from any location globally, providing them with greater flexibility and freedom in choosing where to live and work.\n\nHow work from anywhere (WFA) has changed\n\nWhile the concept of working from anywhere is not new, modern technology such as laptops, tablets, and video conferencing have made it much more accessible to a larger population of workers around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic also accelerated a global shift toward remote work and, in turn, WFA.\n\nWork from anywhere (WFA) before COVID\n\nBefore COVID-19, WFA was relatively rare and mostly accepted by tech companies and startups who employed traveling workers called “digital nomads.” Traditional businesses were often more hesitant to embrace WFA due to concerns about productivity, security, and communication.\n\nWork from anywhere (WFA) during COVID\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of WFA policies as businesses were forced to adapt to lockdowns and social distancing measures. Companies invested in digital tools and infrastructure to support remote work and work-from-home capabilities. But this made many new companies and industries realize the potential for maintaining operations without a physical office.\n\nWork from anywhere (WFA) today\n\nToday, WFA is increasingly common across various industries. Many companies have formalized their WFA policies, recognizing the benefits of flexibility, employee satisfaction, and access to a broader talent pool.\n\nWork from anywhere (WFA) in the future\n\nThe future of WFA looks promising, with continuing advancements in technology making it easier to work from any location. Companies are more likely than ever to adopt hybrid models, combining WFA with occasional in-person meetings to foster collaboration and company culture.\n\nHow do businesses know if WFA is right for them?\n\nBusinesses should consider some or all of the following factors to determine if WFA is suitable for them:\n\nThe nature of the work they do. Some roles require physical presence, while others can be done entirely online.\n\nTheir technology infrastructure. Adequate digital tools and secure networks are essential for adopting WFA.\n\nTheir company culture. Assess whether your company culture can support a distributed workforce.\n\nEmployee preferences. Do your employees want to work elsewhere? Gather their feedback regarding remote work.\n\nWhat is a work from anywhere (WFA) agreement?\n\nA WFA agreement is a formal document or policy outlining the terms and conditions for employees working from any location. It helps make sure both the company and WFA employees have clear expectations for their roles and responsibilities.\n\nWhat does a work from anywhere (WFA) agreement include?\n\nWhen drafting a WFA agreement, consider including these elements:\n\nEligibility: Criteria for employees who can opt for WFA.\n\nResponsibilities: Employee duties and expectations while working remotely.\n\nWork hours (if applicable): Defined working hours and time zone considerations.\n\nCommunication: Protocols for staying in touch with the team and management.\n\nSecurity rules: Measures for maintaining data security and privacy.\n\nCompliance: Adherence to local laws and tax regulations.\n\nPerformance metrics: How productivity and performance will be measured.\n\nFrequently asked questions about working from anywhere\n\nWhat are some common work from anywhere (WFA) jobs?\n\nIn the digital age, many job types can shift to WFA, from software development to customer support to even healthcare roles.\n\nSome of the most common remote and WFA roles today include:\n\nProduct managers\n\nAccount executives\n\nAdministrative assistants\n\nBackend and full-stack software engineers\n\nOperations managers\n\nProject managers\n\nSales managers\n\nSales representatives\n\nSocial media managers\n\nCustomer success representatives\n\nHow can businesses support their work from anywhere (WFA) employees?\n\nProvide the right tools. Make sure employees have access to the technology and software they need.\n\nEncourage regular communication. Establish regular check-ins and team meetings to maintain connection.\n\nProvide training and development. Offer thorough and high-quality onboarding, development opportunities, training on remote work best practices, and other ongoing training.\n\nWrite clear and consistent policies. Maintain clear and comprehensive WFA policies to set expectations and provide guidance—and enforce them consistently.\n\nHow do businesses handle time zone differences with WFA workers?\n\nTime differences can be handled by:\n\nAllowing employees to work flexible hours that fit their time zones.\n\nSetting core hours where all employees are available for meetings and collaboration.\n\nUsing tools like email and project management software to facilitate communication that doesn’t require real-time interaction.\n\nThoroughly documenting communication and collaboration workflows to keep the whole team on the same page.\n\nWhat are the legal considerations for implementing a WFA policy?\n\nLegal considerations for a WFA policy include:\n\nEnsuring employees comply with tax regulations in their location.\n\nAdhering to local labor laws regarding work hours, overtime, and employee rights.\n\nImplementing measures to protect sensitive company and customer data.\n\nHow can businesses measure employee productivity when their workers are distributed?\n\nBusinesses can measure productivity by defining specific, measurable objectives for employees, tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) related to output and efficiency, and conducting regular performance reviews and check-ins to discuss progress and address challenges.\n\nCan only full-time employees work from anywhere?\n\n​​No, both full-time and part-time employees, as well as independent contractors, can work from anywhere, depending on the company's policy and the nature of the job. The flexibility of WFA arrangements allows businesses to cater to different work schedules and employment types.\n\nWhere do businesses find WFA employees?\n\nBusinesses can find WFA employees through many different channels, but online job boards and job postings, like Remote.co, We Work Remotely, and Flexjobs, are the most common. To find workers who are a good fit for your open position, be sure to write a comprehensive, detailed job posting that includes relevant details and qualifications (For example, is the job entry level or does it require certain training or certifications? Is English proficiency required? Do candidates need to be available at certain times, like working hours in North America?).",

They don't want anyone to communicate with them (especially when they know they've screwed up), they don't have anything approaching competency in their customer service program, and it takes them weeks to do the simplest action items, like making a two minute phone call to an insurance company to verify coverage.

With that said, Okta supports authentication from any number of 3rd party IdPs via inbound SAML or OIDC... so if your use case called for Rippling as the IdP and Okta as the SP and MFA provider, and Rippling can send Okta a SAML assertion, then that's doable.\n\n## Comment ID fp3sa1j with +2 score by [(tinesio, Reddit, 2020-04-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/okta/comments/gb4zas/rippling_and_okta/fp3sa1j/) (in reply to ID gb4zas):\nWe had a prospect who evaluated Ripping but went with Namely instead. I think Rippling is more suited for smaller, <1000 employees, organizations.  \nI don't think they'll talk directly to each other, however the Rippling API is still fine for listing users, changing user profiles & group and permissions etc. ( although IIRC some features like user creation may not have been available) so it shouldn't be very hard to sync between the two. They definitely do offer some features like SSO similar to OKTA but you don't have to configure them",

The end of the work day is 8pm.  We normally run and approve payroll on Monday (4 days before pay date). On weeks with a bank holiday, Rippling requires us to process payroll the PRIOR FRIDAY, even before the end of the work day!  \n\n\nSince we can't legally run payroll before the week's work is even done, we are charged a penalty every week there is a bank holiday (as we are now forced to run a 'late' payroll).  \n\n\nBecause of this, we have moved back to our old payroll processor. Today, I have been told that Rippling will not cancel the contract, even though I feel they are trying to force us into an illegal practice. So, unless something changes, we will be paying Rippling for another 7 months for absolutely nothing.  \n\n\nHas anyone else experienced this?

Companies do it all the time. Employees project the hours they plan to work, you process payroll. After the work week is done you go back and make any needed corrections to the projected hours. \n\nColleges shut down for two weeks over shutdowns and still pay their employees. How do they do this? Their employees project their hours and they process the payrolls in advance.\n\n### Comment ID jqw5kwh with +1 score by [(Physical-Clue-1713, Reddit, 2023-07-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Payroll/comments/14s7dft/need_advice_please_has_anyone_else_experienced/jqw5kwh/) (in reply to ID jqvzull):\nThanks for the feedback.  A little more clarification - we have salary and contractors.  The salary employees are not an issue.  The issue is with the contractors.  We pay for work they complete the prior week, and we don't have a way to project what they will submit.  (All work has to be inspected and approved).  In any case where there is a holiday in a week, through no fault of their own, we would have to shortchange their pay (as work wasn't submitted until after Rippling's cutoff time), then reimburse the following week.    \n\n\nBecause they are contractors, we can't pay ahead, based on what they project.  We could pay out, then they don't submit work or don't return.  \n\n\nAgain, I do appreciate the insight about the colleges, and I do agree that if we were all employees, this might not be an issue.

Or it’s just recommended since the default is to move the processing date back one day if it falls on a bank holiday? You’re still processing well enough in advance if you were to process Tuesday in this case. My company gives clients the choice if they want to move back or forward, but back is the default. As long as they process 48 business hours before check date that’s all that matters. Bear in mind I’m not familiar with Rippling but I deal with most other bureaus on a regular basis and some of them even allow you to submit with 24 hours notice. Edit…I’m off this week so I forgot Tuesday was the holiday….so in this case you should have been able to process Monday anyway….seems dumb they would charge a late fee.\n\n### Comment ID jqw6cy2 with +1 score by [(Physical-Clue-1713, Reddit, 2023-07-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Payroll/comments/14s7dft/need_advice_please_has_anyone_else_experienced/jqw6cy2/) (in reply to ID jqw5jhx):\nThanks for the comments.  \nIt is required, not a recommendation.

This has been a truly horrible company to work \"with\".   The reason I posted the original question was to see if any others have had the same experience with Rippling.)  \n\n\nIt seems every new client at Rippling starts processing on Monday (for a Friday payroll).  If you are 'good' for 6 months, you are deemed worthy of requesting to be moved to Wednesday processing.  \nWell, Rippling has a '3 strike' policy.  Meaning, you have to stay on Monday processing if you are late 3 times.  Unless there is a holiday in that week, where you then have to process payroll the Friday afternoon before without penalty.  \n\n\nSince our work week ends on Friday night, every following week that has a holiday is an automatic  'strike' against us.    \n\n\n(As a side note - Not counting January 1, there are 9 bank holidays in 2023.  We will NEVER have 6 months of not having a strike according to their 'rules'.)\n\n(I'm not sure if any of these chat comments are overlapping, but for clarification - our work week ends at 8pm on Friday night, which is the cutoff for our contractors to submit work completed.   Submitted work needs to be inspected and approved, which is always completed by Saturday morning.)  \n\n\nAlso note - if you have to run a 'late' or 'expedited' payroll (which we do with every week with a holiday), you have 2 additional hoops to jump through with Rippling:  \n\n\n1. Pay an additional penalty (they call it a 'processing' fee) of $50, and\n2. Wire money in to pay for the payroll (additional fees), (they will not do a bank withdrawal for expedited payroll requests - you have to do a bank wire to fund the payroll).\n\nI was originally with another payroll processor, who I absolutely enjoyed working with, but Rippling offered some automation features that I thought would help our business (like having onboarding contractors electronically sign documents and submit license / insurance information.  The thought was by automating, we would save several steps and a lot of time while onboarding.  Well, the grass is not always greener ......  \n\n\nI also discovered this week that while we signed up with Rippling, the company owner had to sign a \"Subscription Agreement\", which looked pretty simple at first glance.  That is, until you go near the bottom, where is buried a link to its 'terms and conditions' page (which I think nobody every really reads in detail).    \n\n\nIf I had a chance to read those 'terms and conditions' at the beginning before the owner signed, we would have never gone with Rippling.  \n\n\nThank you for the comments, I do appreciate the suggestions and insight from everyone that has replied.  \n\n\nThe original question remains - has anyone else had this kind of experience with Rippling?",

I hope you took the interview to feel it out while doing your due diligence.  Glassdoor reviews are hit or miss and the way I look at it is consistency over time. There’s a lot of recurring themes over the course of 2+ years, and I’m sure you can figure that out. Also, there’s an influx of 30+ 5 star reviews during the last 3 weeks. Coincidence? I think not.  Executive leadership and HR have been pushing folks to spam positive reviews to try and turn their reputation around. Check Blind and you’ll see the same themes (poor WLB, lack of culture, poor leadership, etc).\n\nYou bet you can expect to work 50-60 hr weeks regardless of team and if you miss your quota for whatever reason (PTO, sickness, etc), you will get dinged.  The company does mass hires because they are very quick to PIP (thinly veiled as a performance driven org). If you’re able to close on a prospect, good luck on retention because the implementation team hires junior level workers (translation: cheap pay) who don’t know the product any better than sales.\n\n### Comment ID l81xwz3 with +1 score by [(CommercialRun335, Reddit, 2024-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1ccwq5e/is_working_at_rippling_really_as_bad_as_the/l81xwz3/) (in reply to ID l7vnzxy):\nHow are the benefits?

HR team wants to switch with +8 score by [(BigConsideration1257, Reddit, 2024-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Payroll/comments/1bd5w7o/opinions_on_rippling_hr_team_wants_to_switch/)\n**UPDATE:** HR has informed us that they are planning to move ahead with Rippling. Their specific feedback was that we need to stop being short-sighted and accept that the system will have some minor limitations.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe currently process a weekly \"to current\" payroll through UKG. Our HR team abhors UKG because they never bothered to learn how to use it correctly or leverage its features. They are dead set on switching to literally any other system and have fallen in love with Rippling.  \nPersonally, I was not a fan as it seems like everything is setup for you to blindly trust the system. Even their promotional materials said processing should only take 5 minutes with a maximum of 30 minutes. I feel like it lacks a lot of admin controls during processing or checks and balances since everything updates automatically. It's terrifying to me that someone's 401(k) elections can update while I'm processing payroll and I have no way to lock data. It also feels like we're losing a lot of functionality we have in UKG (the \"Undo/restart cycle\" ability has been a literal lifesaver).\n\nIs there anyone here who has experience with Rippling?\n\n## Comment ID kukj9ex with +15 score by [(acatwithnoname, Reddit, 2024-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Payroll/comments/1bd5w7o/opinions_on_rippling_hr_team_wants_to_switch/kukj9ex/) (in reply to ID 1bd5w7o):\nI would steer clear solely based on it being founded by CEO Parker Conrad the guy that started Zenefits.

Unfortunately I don’t know of any way to fix that—when it’s gone, it’s gone. Those spots are probably stress points when the jeans are taken on/off or worn (although I have one pair of stretch chinos with a patch like that right in the middle of one thigh above the knee, not exactly a high wear area, so idk). \n\nIf a lot of your stretch jeans give out there first, that could be a fitting issue (maybe you need a bit more room in the front crotch?), but stuff also does just wear out with time. I like to line dry my jeans anyway because the indigo dye lasts longer and the legs don’t shrink shorter that way. It might help the elastic life, I don’t know!

Completely and utterly toxic culture with totally inept leadership. They churn and burn employees as fast as they hire, their hiring numbers are staggering but I assure you they’re firing numbers would be equal if not greater. Everyone who works there is so stressed out they’re ready to implode. Nobody I know that still works there is happy, but they feel trapped because of how bad the job market is right now. I suspect there will be a pretty big exodus when things improve.  Fuck that company, fuck Parker Conrad, and I hope Rippling fails miserably.\n\n### Comment ID kxyx4ol with +82 score by [(Hyndis, Reddit, 2024-04-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1bv7zhl/exclusive_sf_tech_company_rippling_quadruples/kxyx4ol/) (in reply to ID kxytzhu):\nOne of the job listings in particularly is shocking. Its a requirement that one of the marketing people maintain a 4.9 / 5 average review for the company.\n\nIts not realistic to demand a near perfect score. Anyone who's done marketing and surveys can tell you that people won't give you perfect scores across the board. This is why NPS has a range of good scores, not just the maximum possible. \n\nIf you see a company that has a 4.9 / 5 rating you can guarantee that the company is conspiring with the review site to selectively remove or edit reviews for its own benefit. Its kind of like seeing a product on Amazon with a 4.9/5 stars, or 5/5 stars. That never happens organically. Something fishy is going on with those reviews.\n\nWhoever gets hired for this position is going to have to either work with the review site to delete bad reviews, or they're set up for failure with an impossible goal.\n\n#### Comment ID kxzc71b with +19 score by [(novium258, Reddit, 2024-04-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1bv7zhl/exclusive_sf_tech_company_rippling_quadruples/kxzc71b/) (in reply to ID kxyx4ol):\nIf I could brand something on the forehead of ever executive in tech, it would be that saying that once a metric becomes a target, it ceases to be a good metric.

When I started working there they were really attainable, but it was also very focused on retention. By the time I left, the quotas were huge and growing, our director was telling us to lie to customers to make sales and that our role no longer cared about retention. It was not the role I was hired for, and I left after 1 year. Shortly after, the sales team absorbed the CSM’s and there was no longer a success org at Rippling. They fired a lot of people for “performance issues” but the reality was that the sales team couldn’t absorb everyone so they found a way to let people go. Everyone let go was given a 1-2 week severance package.\n\n#### Comment ID ky1h5gr with +9 score by [(SelfUnimpressed, Reddit, 2024-04-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1bv7zhl/exclusive_sf_tech_company_rippling_quadruples/ky1h5gr/) (in reply to ID kxyx4ol):\n> If you see a company that has a 4.9 / 5 rating you can guarantee that the company is conspiring with the review site to selectively remove or edit reviews for its own benefit\n\nI work for a (small) tech company that has a 4.9 rating on at least one major review site. We're at 4.8 on another and 9/10 on another. It's not fishy. We just ask customers internally to rate their experience periodically, and the ones who are happy we later ask to review the site. We have no ability to edit the reviews posted and have no sway or editing power over any of these third-party review sites.\n\nWe also have good customer service and don't piss off massive hordes of people by treating them like dirt, so there aren't a lot of people out there who are mad at us and looking to give us bad reviews. And also we don't try to sell the tool to people if it won't work for them or help them.\n\nIf you want to know how we manage this without cheating, the fundamental answer is that we're not VC-backed and can run the company however we want instead of squeezing our customers for as much profit as possible and growing the company as fast and as as big as possible.\n\n### Comment ID ky0fwkt with +12 score by [(TrapHouse9999, Reddit, 2024-04-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1bv7zhl/exclusive_sf_tech_company_rippling_quadruples/ky0fwkt/) (in reply to ID kxytzhu):\nWow that’s crazy thanks for sharing.

VC’s have more power there than Parker, and I would bet huge hiring numbers are a good selling point to get more funding. “We’re growing! Look at how many people we’re hiring!” Meanwhile they operate so deep in the red it’s going to take eons to become profitable. \n\nThe ridiculous part about it is they must be spending a fortune in training. They’re training process is 3 months long, and before you’re even done training you’re being handed full workloads because they fired some other poor person. You get a workload, you get held to the same expectations as a fully trained employee, and you get threatened with a PIP before you finish training. 4 months in you get fired and on to the next person.

Its not that the money was gone, its that the money was temporarily inaccessible, but it was needed immediately.\n\nThats why bank failures suck, and its not Rippling's fault because SVB went under.\n\n## Comment ID kxyhwaw with +6 score by [(rnjbond, Reddit, 2024-04-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1bv7zhl/exclusive_sf_tech_company_rippling_quadruples/kxyhwaw/) (in reply to ID 1bv7zhl):\nMan, lots of haters here.

I’m not trying to look at your bank account numbers, your personal email, or judge you for your pornographic preferences. These MDM systems are designed to help make sure that the computer is updated and that certain things like system encryption are enabled. ￼￼That said, these MDM systems allow Admins to install additional programs, potentially silently, which may be able to track that sort of information should the CEO or law-enforcement deem it necessary. ￼ \n\nIf you don’t want work to know about it, don’t do it on your work computer or using your work accounts. ￼\n\n### Comment ID jgnubve with +7 score by [(Heteronymous, Reddit, 2023-04-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/jgnubve/) (in reply to ID jgmh87v):\nThis, 💯\nOP: Stop being foolish by fishing for answers that are telling you want you want to hear !\n\nu/briancanfixit nailed the truth of it. \n[edit to fix typos]\n\n### Comment ID lo8gyzo with +1 score by [(Okay_sounding, Reddit, 2024-09-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/lo8gyzo/) (in reply to ID jgmh87v):\nThis is great. But what if I own my machine? I'm working as a contractor for a company, and they had me install Vanta on \\*my\\* machine as part of syncing with Confluence, Slack, and Google Workspace. Can they monitor things outside of their Google Workspace with Vanta and related tools? That is, can they 'jump that fence' and monitor my work for other clients, which I do via my personal Google Workspace on the same machine?

Rippling itself looks like it has a pretty toned down, basic MDM, but from what I recall when they courted our company their primary focus is HR/onboarding. The MDM-esque features are just another side of the onboarding the bundled to simplify/reduce tools for businesses. The reports boasted by Rippling do not include any kind of user activity tracking outside of the optional time clock.\n\n## Comment ID jgm6jm3 with +7 score by [(DigDugteam, Reddit, 2023-04-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/jgm6jm3/) (in reply to ID 12pi5k6):\nGood news is that rippling MDM is a piece of shit.

They help companies achieve SOC2 and other security/privacy certifications. The Vanta agent which gets installed on workstations collects a bunch of information about the configuration of your workstation and reports back to their platform, which is then used as compliance evidence for their regular audits.\n\nThe MDM likely doesn't do any tracking by default - they're there mostly to enforce certain configuration parameters (disk encryption, screen lock timeouts, etc). That said, it's trivial for them to be able to use the MDM to push out any other type of monitoring that is deemed appropriate by company leadership.\n\nI am not a fan of dragnet-style monitoring, but I have in a few cases, been asked by company leadership to perform some more detailed monitoring on a case-by-case basis - things like collecting browser history, etc. Once an MDM is installed, things like this are very easy.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID jgnl5rp with +1 score by [(alephthirteen, Reddit, 2023-04-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/jgnl5rp/) (in reply to ID 12pi5k6):\nTL;DR Getting a tablet or Chromebook or even a new MacBook Air to browse the web is going to be way cheaper and less disruptive to your life than ***getting a new job***. Don't think about how likely it is they'll catch you. That's the wrong framework. Think about whether being fired would be a hassle. I imagine it would be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like you are in a remote work situation? They probably aren't filming your house--some companies do demand the webcam stays on, but not many--but everything on the device should be **assumed** to be company monitored. Their money, after all.\n\n\\- They quite possibly can see your web history. Not via the MDM itself, but any number of VPNs or filtering softwares do this.- They almost certainly can tell what apps you install.- Whatever security/endpoint software they install could have tons of other capabilities, too. Keystroke monitoring, logging what devices you plug in, etc.\n\nI'm in IT and the guy in charge of keeping the Macs compliant, so I need to be walking the walk. I'm a big fan of watching a YouTube or two in the breakroom over lunch, so people don't chase me down for tickets. I put my iPad in my bag and leave it off until I'm at lunch, put my phone in hotspot, then pull up whatever and watch it. Full division. Not their WiFi network. Not their gear. No one disturbed (except perhaps by my weird laugh).\n\nIf it's something that needs something more power than say, a basic iPad, Android tablet or Chromebook can do, I'd recommend you take a step back and think again, not about whether they'll catch you but whether you should be doing it on company time. Pull out your phone and make a note of the URL if it's a cool article you want to read, then read it later. If it's music, do it on your phone. Other things, maybe just do it after work.\n\nBut I wouldn't be doing Photoshop freelancing or playing Civ 6 or development in Docker containers or whatever on company time, and I can't think what else might need that much power. Most things that might be legit background stuff for WFH could also be done by your phone.\n\nIf you're freelancing, first, check if your contract allows it. And if your contract allows it, you should ***absolutely not*** be doing that on hardware they paid for.\n\n## Comment ID jgoibku with +1 score by [(slykido999, Reddit, 2023-04-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/jgoibku/) (in reply to ID 12pi5k6):\nIf ever you’re concerned about what IT can do to the computer you’re using, you should do it on your own personally owned computer without MDM.\n\n## Comment ID k08fcay with +1 score by [(ratatouille_artist, Reddit, 2023-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/12pi5k6/how_intrusive_is_vantarippling/k08fcay/) (in reply to ID 12pi5k6):\nI just installed Vanta myself and luckily it doesn't seem too intrusive.

If you are a great figure-outer and can do your own research, you will do well at Rippling. They also have lots of office hours and extra training sessions, as well as Slack channels to help answer questions and further your knowledge.\n\nThe system is so user friendly that you and clients can figure out a lot on their own.

You are interacting with really smart people and teams on a day to day basis, and hence learning and growing.\n\nOpen and improved engineering culture: There aren't any boundaries on people to go and learn, major engineering projects are put in open for others to discuss and learn. The engineering team and culture has improved vastly in the last 2 years, with a lot of seasoned staff and senior staff engineers in the org.\n\nProduct and revenue growth: Rippling's clarity in what they want to build had been astonishing from day 1. Some of the products that we recently launched are things that comp any had in their plan from day 1. There is so much conviction and clarity into all the product and engineering investment that most of our products launched scale from 0 to few millions of revenue within their first year. The revenue growth has been astonishing, not derailed by many macro economic crisis. The revenue stream is diversified and proven to be resilient to so many external factors.",

This is a place to grow your career. Pay is competitive.\n- You end up learning a lot of stuff that is applicable elsewhere.\n- Managers are hired because they're both good people managers but also can be hands on as needed.",

The reviews that state work life balance is awful are 100% true, and unfortunately, you will likely burn out before the company reaches their IPO anyway. This isn’t necessarily Ripplings fault entirely, it’s just that payroll, benefits, Hr is a grueling awful vertical to play in. You’ll quickly get tired of clients complaining about almost every aspect of the product. Trust me, it brings your life down so much that you’ll start questioning your career path. The executive team in this company needs to realize that sometimes building new SKU’s for the sake of new SKU’s is not going to sit well with your current client base. Current client enhancements can go often ignored… I expect a relatively high client churn rate for the next few years, before management gets the clue and maybe 180’s their strategy. They’ll need to do this before it’s too late and total ARR starts moving in the wrong direction. Product is struggling to scale to enterprise level/quality, but that’s a challenge at all SaaS companies. If you’re okay grinding and saying goodbye to your friends and family, then this may be an okay place for you. Otherwise, find a better SaaS vertical to play in.",

Instead, it has been incredibly refreshing as a member of the legal and compliance team to get a running head start on nearly all projects, so that we can pull together the right compliance infrastructure for our products, and be deeply embedded in our product initiatives, often dogfooding and testing what we've advised on and built. Our team has also gotten to be true advocates, fiercely defend our employees from aggressive competitor tactics, pulling together a first rate immigration program for our team, commanding one of the most efficient sales/commercial processes. In short, it is really fun (and rare) to help win as a business, while also doing it the right way and with flair. And we have fun :) \n\nRippling is also one of the most transparent places that I have worked in that, top down and bottoms up, people actually say what they are thinking and have discussions. While candor can take some getting used to (and for some, may seem like a con), it has meant that this has been the least political and bureaucratic place that I have ever worked. There's simply has been no room for politics (giving off appearance instead of reality) because people say whats on their mind, ask a lot of questions, and \"go and see\" what the truth/reality is.",

The overall vibe at Rippling is “you are lucky to work here, so you take what you’re given.” This has worked for them so far in the startup phase, but I see this crumbling in the near future. You can’t have the turnover this company has and execute a successful longterm strategy.\n-generally, middle managers are inexperienced and aren’t on your side\n-work-life balance is non-existent and in fact, the CEO has said in so many words that he doesn’t believe in it\n-there doesn’t seem to be an overall vision or strategy: for the product, for company initiatives, for any part of Rippling.

How can you expect customers to have a good experience when you’re not even supporting the people who are client-facing at this company?

A lot of people who work here are kind and cool people but everyone is running around with their heads chopped off. -If you want to be so stressed out of your mind that you stop eating, lose your quality of life, then work here.

The reviews that state work life balance is awful are 100% true, and unfortunately, you will likely burn out before the company reaches their IPO anyway. This isn’t necessarily Ripplings fault entirely, it’s just that payroll, benefits, Hr is a grueling awful vertical to play in. You’ll quickly get tired of clients complaining about almost every aspect of the product. Trust me, it brings your life down so much that you’ll start questioning your career path. The executive team in this company needs to realize that sometimes building new SKU’s for the sake of new SKU’s is not going to sit well with your current client base. Current client enhancements can go often ignored… I expect a relatively high client churn rate for the next few years, before management gets the clue and maybe 180’s their strategy. They’ll need to do this before it’s too late and total ARR starts moving in the wrong direction. Product is struggling to scale to enterprise level/quality, but that’s a challenge at all SaaS companies. If you’re okay grinding and saying goodbye to your friends and family, then this may be an okay place for you. Otherwise, find a better SaaS vertical to play in.",

Our team has also gotten to be true advocates, fiercely defend our employees from aggressive competitor tactics, pulling together a first rate immigration program for our team, commanding one of the most efficient sales/commercial processes. In short, it is really fun (and rare) to help win as a business, while also doing it the right way and with flair. And we have fun :) \n\nRippling is also one of the most transparent places that I have worked in that, top down and bottoms up, people actually say what they are thinking and have discussions. While candor can take some getting used to (and for some, may seem like a con), it has meant that this has been the least political and bureaucratic place that I have ever worked.

      "# [Rippling Announces Series F Fundraising & Tender Offer by Parker Conrad on 2024-04-22](https://www.rippling.com/blog/rippling-announces-series-f-fundraising-and-tender-offer)\nWe’re pleased to announce Rippling has raised $200M in new financing, and signed agreements with investors to repurchase up to $590M of equity from current employees, former employees, and early investors. The financing was led by Coatue with participation from Founders Fund, Greenoaks, and other existing investors. Dragoneer is joining the round as a new investor.\n\nThe financing values the company at $13.5 billion.\n\nWe’re grateful for these investors’ conviction in Rippling, for the employees that have gotten us to this point, and for our clients, without whom none of this would be possible.\n\nRippling’s core thesis is that employee data is critical to a surprisingly large number of business systems, including the ones well outside of HR.\n\nMaintaining the fidelity of the same employee data across all these disconnected systems—effectively, across multiple separate databases—is the reason it’s a lot of work for companies to have many different business systems in the first place. Rippling solves this problem by giving companies and employees a single place to make changes, which then propagate everywhere automatically.\n\nThe system that does this isn’t just a time-saver—we believe it will be a critical primitive for business software going forward.\n\nProducts that are built on top of a rich graph of data about the organization, employees, their devices and apps aren’t just easier to manage. They are better as software products—with more intelligent workflows and approvals, better role-based policies and permissions, and more powerful analytics.\n\nThis system we’ve built helps companies run more efficiently and achieve their business goals faster than their competitors. We will continue to expand in new markets and invest deeply in R&D to enhance our current offering and build new products to support our clients.\n\nTo better understand Rippling’s approach and where we’re headed, you can read a lightly redacted version of the memo I wrote for investors ahead of this financing.",
      "# [Rippling’s Parker Conrad on the company's new round, new SF lease and, also, its newest critic by Connie Loizos on 2024-04-22](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/ripplings-parker-conrad-on-the-companys-brand-new-round-its-brand-new-sf-lease-and-also-its-brand-new-critic/)\nLast week, TechCrunch broke the news that the workforce management software outfit Rippling was on the cusp of closing a new, $200 million round of funding at a hefty $13.4 billion valuation led by Coatue. We also reported that the round featured a separate, $670 million secondary component meant to give some of the company’s investors a bigger bite of the company, while letting Rippling’s employees — some of whom joined at the outset in 2016 — cash out some of their shares.\n\nRippling declined to comment at the time, but in an interview Friday afternoon, founder Parker Conrad confirmed our information, adding that the secondary component is actually a $590 million tender, with $200 million available for employees and $390 million available for seed and other investors.\n\nThe round, Rippling’s Series F, is also almost entirely an inside round. Coatue is an earlier investor in Rippling, along with other backers in this round that have been investing all along, including Founders Fund and Greenoaks. The only new member on the cap table is Dragoneer, a growth-stage investment firm in San Francisco.\n\nOf course, we were interested in much more than Rippling’s new fundraise, so while we had Conrad on the phone, we talked turnover. We discussed the company’s new office lease in San Francisco (right now, it’s the second-biggest lease to be signed this year in the city). Conrad also shared why Rippling is relatively “free” of AI. You can hear that full conversation in podcast form; if you prefer to read it, excerpts of that conversation follow, edited for length.\n\nSo why raise this money?\n\nHonestly, it started out as just an employee tender. We wanted to find a way to get some liquidity for early employees, so we went to market, looking really to do about $200 million for employees that wanted to sell some stock. [But] we got a lot of investor interest, so we expanded it first to include a small amount of primary [capital] — mostly as a way to get more ownership for investors that were looking to buy more — and then beyond that, we ended up expanding into seed investors as well.\n\nWhat does this secondary sale say about your plans to eventually go public? An IPO is a little bit in the distance?\n\nI definitely think it’s a bit in the distance, but it’s not like a way of delaying [anything]. If anything, it’s probably nice if there are people who want to buy a house or [want more cash] because life happens. It’s great to relieve some of that pressure before you go public so that you don’t have tons of people selling as soon as they can in the public markets.\n\nIs this the first time employees have been able to sell some shares?\n\nIt’s not. We did something in 2021. But it was smaller and the company was smaller, and it was a long time ago.\n\nDo you worry about employees leaving after cashing out?\n\nOne of the things that we talked about internally when we launched it was, we said, ‘Look, the first rule of an employee tender is that you don’t talk about the tender internally or publicly.’ We don’t want to see anyone spiking the football, or something like that. And the second rule of the employee tender is, ‘see the first rule.’ This is a very private, personal thing, and I’m thrilled for everyone [participating]; if this makes a difference in [their] life, that’s great. But it’s not the destination. The game’s not over.\n\nHow do you feel about turnover more generally? Some people don’t like to see it; other managers think it’s for the best. Elon Musk seems to be a fan, given the rate at which he turns over his executive team at Tesla.\n\nThe executive team at Rippling has been remarkably stable for a long time. A lot of the people on the team are people who I originally hired for those roles. Some of them are people I have long work histories with, even before this company. And certainly I always like to keep people. I mean, every once in a while, there’s an early Rippling employee who leaves the company, and I find it always just emotionally really sad when that happens, even if the company is going to be fine and they want to do something else or, you know, in some cases just kind of hang out. On a personal level, that’s always very difficult for me.\n\nYou newly leased 123,000 square feet in San Francisco for local employees, who are now back three days a week. How did you settle on that policy, and do you worry about retention or hiring?\n\nWe just think there’s an enormous amount of value of people being in the office together. We were never a company that was going remote. When we went remote temporarily during the pandemic, we said, this is for three weeks, and then we’re going back to the office. Of course, it was unfortunately a lot longer than that, but we were back in the office as soon as we could be. I think it’s possible for some companies to be fully remote, but it’s sort of like playing the game on hard mode. I think it’s a lot easier if people can get together in person; you get a lot done.\n\nIn the meantime, workforce management software is super crowded. You’re going up against a company that you famously co-founded and ran, Zenefits. There’s Paycor, Workday, Gusto, to name a few . . .\n\nThe weird thing is that Rippling is not actually a [human capital management] HCM company. Everyone who has been building business software believes that the way to build the best business software is to build these extremely narrow, focused deep products. And I think it’s completely wrong. I think the way you build the best business software is to build a really broad product suite of deeply integrated and seamlessly interoperable products. Yes, we have a very strong HR and payroll suite, but we also have an IT and security suite; we have a spend management suite, where we do things like corporate cards and bill pay and expense reimbursements. Actually, we’re using the primary capital that we raised in this round to fund the R&D efforts for a new, fourth cloud that we intend to launch in a completely different area.\n\nThe classic example of a company that builds software in this way is Microsoft. Microsoft is like the OG of compound software businesses.\n\nSpeaking of Microsoft, what is your “AI strategy”?\n\nWe are a company that is relatively free of any AI products right now. There’s some stuff that we’re working on. But I am always very skeptical of things that are, like, super trendy in Silicon Valley. So I can tell you what [our AI strategy] is not. I’m super skeptical of these chatbots. I don’t think anyone wants to chat with their HR software.\n\nI have to ask about a tweet related to our story about your new round. I saw [Benchmark general partner] Bill Gurley chimed in that “Anti-focus ain’t cheap.” I wasn’t sure if that was laudatory or a dig. Do you know?\n\nI assume given that it came from Bill that it’s a dig. And he’s not wrong that taking this opposite approach is expensive, particularly on the R&D side. If you look at Rippling financially, the thing that really stands out is how we spend on R&D. If you compare us to other HCM competitors — because you talked about the crowded HCM space — they spend an average of 10% of their revenue on R&D. Next year, Rippling is going to spend as much on R&D as [three rival companies] combined, and we have a much lower revenue footprint than the three. It’s definitely true that there’s a huge upfront investment phase in building what we’re building that obviously over time, as a percent of revenue, should come down. So he’s not wrong, but it’s a very explicit part of our strategy. What Bill might not totally understand is the benefit that you get from building software in this way; much higher upfront R&D costs [later result in] much higher sales and marketing efficiency.\n\nHas Bill ever done business with you?\n\nNo, I’ve never met Bill. He’s sort of a constant, low-grade antagonist, but I’ve never actually met him.\n\nI know he doesn’t get along very well with Marc Andreessen.\n\nThen Bill and I have that in common.

It is integrated with more than 500 apps and helps businesses execute more efficiently.\n\n“Rippling’s core thesis is that employee data is critical to a surprisingly large number of business systems, including the ones well outside of HR,” Conrad wrote in the post.\n\nBy providing a single place where companies and employees can make changes, which then propagate everywhere automatically, Rippling solves the challenge of maintaining the accuracy of employee data across disconnected systems, according to the post.\n\nThis not only saves time but also enables more intelligent workflows and approvals, better role-based policies and permissions, and more powerful analytics, the post said.\n\n“The system we’ve built helps companies run more efficiently and achieve their business goals faster than their competitors,” Conrad wrote in the post. “We will continue to expand in new markets and invest deeply in R&D to enhance our current offering and build new products to support our clients.”\n\nIt was reported April 16 that Rippling was in discussions about a funding round that would value it at $13.4 billion. The company had already raised a total of $1.2 billion, TechCrunch reported at the time.\n\nRippling’s Series F round comes about a year after it raised $500 million in Series E financing and was valued at $11.25 billion. That valuation was about the same as its Series D financing in May 2022, the company said in a March 17 blog post.",
      "# [American HRtech disruptor Rippling seeks funding at $13.4B valuation — TFN by Abhinaya Prabhu on 2024-04-18](https://techfundingnews.com/american-hrtech-disruptor-rippling-seeks-funding-at-13-4b-valuation/)\nSan Francisco-headquartered HRtech startup Rippling is in talks to raise new funding of $870 million valuing it at $13.4 billion. Last year, the company secured $500 million in a Series E round, which valued it at $11.25 billion.\n\nUpcoming funding plans\n\nAs per TechCrunch, the upcoming round is said to include a $200 million injection of capital and $670 million of shares being sold by existing stockholders. It is also reported that existing investor Napoleon Ta at Founders Fund is prepared to invest up to another $310 million. This would be the largest check that Founders Fund has ever written for a single company’s round. In addition, existing investor Coatue (invested in Ramp and GoStudent) will lead the round alongside participation from Greenoaks.\n\nRippling’s last round came during the Silicon Valley Bank crisis, when the company’s funds were suddenly frozen. The company extended its own capital to fund its customers’ payments to employees, hoping to recover funds from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC).\n\nGoing by the report, the upcoming Series F round would add to the total of $1.2 billion Rippling has raised until now.\n\nNotably, the talks with investors are ongoing, with plans to finalize terms within a few weeks, people familiar with the matter said. The discussions are still fluid and the numbers could change.\n\nFunds utilisation\n\nThe San Francisco-based startup will use the new funds to land more mid-size business customers internationally and continue building more products. The company recently signed a 123,000-square-foot lease in San Francisco for office space that would give it room to hire hundreds more people. The lease is the city’s second-largest of the year, said the outlet.\n\nAutomation-focused HRtech\n\nCloud-based HRtech platform Rippling was founded by Parker Conrad and Prasanna Sankar in 2016. It is designed to assist with onboarding, payroll, benefits, and vacation tracking. The automation-focused HR software and service solution suited for small, mid-size and enterprise businesses that want to provide an effortless employee onboarding experience.\n\nThe employee management platform streamlines people operations with the help of intuitive automation. Employers can send offer letters, run background checks, collect new-hire paperwork, add employees to payroll, and process health insurance enrollments.\n\nThe platform can also be used to order and ship work equipment to new hires and set them up with everything they need to be successful, including Google Workspace, Slack and Microsoft 365.",
      "# [Governor Hochul Announces State Investment in Tech Firm Rippling’s Expansion in Lower Manhattan to Unlock $29 Million in Research and Development Funding](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-state-investment-tech-firm-ripplings-expansion-lower-manhattan)\nGovernor Kathy Hochul today announced that San Francisco-based Rippling, an innovative workforce management platform, will expand its operations in New York City threefold, creating 390 new jobs and unlocking a $29 million investment in New York-based research and development over the next 10 years. The company, which will occupy 69,000 square feet on the 59th and 60th floors of 4 World Trade Center, is expanding its operations to harness New York City's exceptional workforce talent and benefit from its leadership in the tech and innovation economy, fueling further growth through substantial investments in research and development. Rippling’s expansion in New York City builds on Governor Hochul’s commitment to attracting innovative businesses to New York State, building a 21st century economy, and creating good jobs for New Yorkers.\n\n\"New York is investing in innovative businesses like Rippling that are driving growth in new industries, creating good jobs for New Yorkers, and securing the economic future for our state,” Governor Hochul said. “Rippling’s commitment to tripling its footprint here and investing millions over the next decade to support research and development is proof that our efforts are working, and my administration will continue to support the industry leaders whose breakthrough technologies in AI and other sectors will move our economy forward.”\n\nRippling has committed to creating at least 390 new jobs across its marketing, finance, legal, sales, operations, and engineering teams while retaining 173 full-time employees, supported by up to $3.5 million in performance-based Excelsior Jobs Program tax credits from Empire State Development. The expansion also enables Rippling to invest more than $29 million in research and development spending in New York State over 10 years to build new products and advance its market-leading Spend Management platform, which helps companies manage expenses more efficiently.\n\nEmpire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight said, \"Investing in high-growth companies like Rippling strengthens New York's reputation as a global tech hub, sparking innovation and creating good-paying jobs. ESD is thrilled to support Rippling's expansion as part of our ongoing efforts to cultivate a thriving 21st-century economic landscape. By nurturing tomorrow's industries today, we are unlocking promising futures and fueling inclusive prosperity for all New Yorkers.\"\n\nRippling Co-Founder and CEO Parker Conrad said, \"Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance, bringing together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. By consolidating all of a company's employee data and tools into one system, Rippling enables our clients to achieve their goals faster and more efficiently​. We're grateful for Governor Hochul's leadership ​as we grow the team ​to support our expanding business. 4 World Trade Center is the ideal location as we expand our footprint in New York City.\"\n\nTech:NYC President & CEO Julie Samuels said, “Rippling’s expansion and hiring plans confirm what tens of thousands of other tech companies know: New York City is one of the most attractive places in the world to build and grow a tech company. The tech sector remains committed to powering the region’s economy, and we’re thrilled that leading innovators like Rippling are choosing New York to create jobs, source top talent, and further bolster the city’s position as a global hub for innovation.”\n\nFounded in 2016, Rippling streamlines human resources, information technology, and finance on a unified platform tailored for businesses with 2-2000+ employees, including through the use of artificial intelligence. Rippling consolidates employee management into a single system by centralizing payroll, benefits, device management, and more. This consolidation enables seamless, swift onboarding—allowing companies to configure payroll, corporate cards, devices, and apps for new hires in minutes. With its New York City expansion set to accommodate hundreds of additional hires, Rippling will leverage the larger footprint to keep pace with rapidly accelerating demand while cultivating an in-person work environment.\n\nThe company’s expansion in New York complements Governor Hochul’s State of the State proposal to secure New York’s place at the forefront of the artificial intelligence transformation. The Governor announced the creation of Empire AI, a consortium that will create and launch a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence computing center in Upstate New York to be used by New York’s leading institutions to promote responsible research and development, create jobs, and unlock AI opportunities focused on public good.\n\nIt also represents one of several cutting-edge companies contributing to the acceleration of New York City’s innovation economy under Governor Hochul. With New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Governor Hochul announced progress on SPARC Kips Bay, a first-of-its-kind life sciences career and education hub that will anchor the industry in New York; opened the $700 million state-of-the-art TaysteeLab Building and $9 million expansion of Harlem Biospace in West Harlem; announced Schrödinger, Inc’s $7.6 million expansion in Times Square; the $3 million expansion of communications company MetTel, and the selection of New York City as the future home of the $300 million Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Biohub.",
      "# [floor office in downtown SF, plans hiring spree by Jillian D'Onfro, Jillian D’Onfro on 2024-04-05](https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/tech-firm-office-space-downtown-sf-rippling-19385805.php)\nSan Francisco-based tech startup Rippling has signed a massive lease downtown to serve as its new headquarters. The company will occupy 123,000 square feet of space across the top nine floors of 430 California St., spokesperson Bobby Whithorne told SFGATE.\n\nRippling, which makes a workforce management platform that includes payroll and IT tracking, has 500 local employees and plans to add “hundreds” more, he added. It currently operates out of 55 Second St. and plans to move into the new space in June.\n\nThe deal marks the second-largest office agreement in SF this year, following fintech Adyen’s 150,000-square-foot sublease at 505 Brannan St. in March. Meanwhile, the city’s office vacancies hit a new record in the first quarter of the year, according to the most recent data from commercial real estate firm CBRE — though the report also found that demand had started picking back up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nRippling, which allows employees to work from home twice a week, plans to use the new space for customer events and training sessions as well. “San Francisco will always be home, and 430 California is an ideal location for our expansion,” Rippling Senior Vice President of HR and Client Services Darcy Mackay said in a statement.\n\nThe firm’s commitment to the city prompted praise from Mayor London Breed: “Rippling’s expansion in Downtown San Francisco is great news for our city and our economy,” she said in a statement. Downtown SF has faced a retail exodus lately, particularly in Union Square and the former Westfield mall, though bright spots exist, including the soon-to-open food hall from Ikea’s sister-company Ingka Centres.\n\nThe office, which is walking distance from the Montgomery Street BART stop, was previously occupied by crypto firm Coinbase, which went “remote-first” a few years ago, though it also leases space in the South Bay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nRippling also has offices in Ireland, England, India, Australia and New York City. It was co-founded in San Francisco in 2016 as a second act for Parker Conrad, who resigned amid scandal from his previous HR tech firm Zenefits. The fast-growing firm has since raised $1.2 billion, though its San Francisco presence hasn’t been without snags. The firm caught flak a few years ago for bus stop ads that seemed to glorify one-click layoffs; it took them down in the wake of criticisms. It also had to scramble to find a new banking partner last year during the Silicon Valley Bank meltdown.",

      "# [Rippling vs. ADP Comparison: Which Is Best in 2024? by Skye Schooley on 2023-10-13](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/rippling-vs-adp)\nWho Do We Recommend Rippling For?\n\nRippling is best for small and midsize businesses that need a highly customizable and scalable HR and IT solution. It is especially well suited for businesses that are growing rapidly or expanding into new markets. Rippling can help businesses automate their HR processes, streamline workforce management and manage their IT assets more efficiently.\n\nRippling is also a good choice for businesses that need a global payroll solution. Rippling can support payroll for employees, including complex tax and HR compliance requirements, in several countries.\n\nHere are a few of the attributes that make Rippling an excellent HR solution:\n\nRippling can be used as a PEO, global payroll provider or stand-alone HR software platform.\n\nYou can customize Rippling’s automation features to streamline many HR functions.\n\nRippling offers a combination of HR and IT functions in one centralized platform.\n\nKey TakeawayKey takeaway\n\nRippling provides a centralized workforce management platform that allows businesses to access functions related to payroll, HR, employee benefits and IT.\n\nWho Do We Recommend ADP For?\n\nADP TotalSource is an excellent solution for businesses of all sizes. However, it’s especially well suited to midsize and large businesses. It’s also a good choice for businesses that need a comprehensive HR and payroll solution that can scale as they grow. We like that ADP offers a high level of customer support and can help businesses comply with complex HR and payroll regulations.\n\nADP also offers various industry-specific solutions for hospitality, healthcare and retail businesses.\n\nHere are some attributes that make ADP a great choice for businesses that want to outsource their HR functions:\n\nBusinesses have the option to partner with ADP as a PEO, human resources outsourcing provider or stand-alone HR platform.\n\nADP’s competitive benefits and payroll platform are great for midsize and growing businesses.\n\nADP provides a team of HR experts to assist businesses with their specific HR needs.\n\nDid You Know?Did you know\n\nADP is a top-rated HR solution and is considered among the best HR outsourcing services in the industry.\n\nRippling vs. ADP Comparison\n\nPricing\n\nRippling\n\nRippling doesn’t provide much pricing information online, primarily because it’s such a highly customizable platform. To get a quote, you must contact a representative to build an HR, finance and IT package based on the features you need. The base workforce management platform, Rippling Unity, starts at $8 per month. However, you’ll likely want to add more features to handle your HR and other operational needs.\n\nHere are some key points about Rippling Unity pricing:\n\nRippling Unity service plans: Users can choose from four base plans: Core, Pro, Unlimited and Enterprise. Each tier provides various workforce management features, including global workforce analytics and policy management.\n\nAdd-ons: Rippling also offers various add-on modules, including IT asset management, mobile device management and app management. Add-on prices depend on the specific module and the number of users. More traditional HR add-ons include payroll processing (U.S. and global), benefits administration, time-tracking tools, HR compliance assistance, recruiting and onboarding services, and more.\n\nProduct demo: While we would have liked to see a free trial, we appreciate that potential customers can access a free product demo to get a feel for the platform.\n\nADP\n\nADP outlines its payroll and PEO plans online. However, like Rippling, it doesn’t list its prices online. Instead, the company has customizable plans based on a business’s size and needs.\n\nADP offers two bundles with payroll and HR functions that may appeal to small businesses:\n\nComplete: The Complete plan includes payroll with direct deposit and other essential features, along with new-hire onboarding, background checks, HR training and tool kits, and more.\n\nHR Pro: The HR Pro plan includes everything in the Complete plan, plus employee handbook assistance, an applicant tracking system, a learning management system and more.\n\nPEO services, compliance functions, benefits, time and attendance features, and other services are also available. Again, to get pricing information, you’ll need to contact the company for a custom quote.\n\nConsider these additional points about ADP’s pricing:\n\nEmployers must have at least five employees to use ADP’s PEO services.\n\nADP offers base plans and optional add-ons.\n\nADP has PEO and non-PEO plans.\n\nBest Pricing\n\nTie\n\nWe called a tie in this category. ADP and Rippling have similar pricing models. Both offer base plans and a wide range of optional add-ons. Although Rippling lists its starting price per employee online, you'll likely need several additional features, which means you'll have to contact a representative to get a custom quote, just as you'll need to do for ADP. Both PEO services also require employers to have a minimum of five employees.\n\nTipTip\n\nCheck out our review of Zenefits if transparent pricing is important to you. Zenefits clearly outlines the prices of its HR services and add-ons online.\n\nHR Services\n\nRippling\n\nEssential HR features: Rippling’s base plan gives you the foundational HR features you need to onboard new hires, create and enforce company policies (like ​​time-off policies), manage employee data, automate workflows, and track vacation and leave time.\n\nOptional HR services: Rippling’s optional HR add-ons give you the power to recruit top talent, manage employee benefits, track time and attendance, process payroll, train employees and get HR support, all in one place.\n\nFinance and IT services: Rippling’s finance and IT products (e.g., inventory, expense and app management) seamlessly integrate with its HR features to create one centralized management platform.\n\nPEO services: PEO and employer of record services are available. Rippling users can scale between PEO and non-PEO services.\n\nADP\n\nEmployee acquisition features: ADP offers a suite of employee acquisition features for recruiting, onboarding, training and managing workers.\n\nEssential HR services: ADP provides essential HR administrative services, such as employee handbook creation, document management and HR reports.\n\nCompliance solutions: ADP’s compliance and risk management solutions help businesses protect their employees, manage workers’ compensation claims, verify employment statuses, and navigate unemployment claims.\n\nFYIDid you know\n\nADP consistently monitors changes to payroll regulations and labor laws, including minimum-wage laws, and alerts businesses to necessary updates.\n\nBest HR Services\n\nRippling\n\nBoth Rippling and ADP offer comprehensive HR services to help businesses manage their HR functions efficiently. However, Rippling's ability to automate many of these services stood out to us because HR automation streamlines a company's HR processes. Rippling also offers app and device management services, allowing employers to manage these functions on the same platform as their other, more traditional HR services.\n\nRippling’s device management feature directly integrates with the rest of its HR functions. Source: Rippling\n\nPayroll\n\nRippling\n\nTime and attendance functions: Rippling’s time and attendance functionality can sync seamlessly with its payroll and PTO features.\n\nPayroll processing: If you choose Rippling’s PEO option, you must use the company’s payroll processing services. However, you can also add U.S. or global payroll to your subscription.\n\nAutomatic payroll calculations: Rippling takes the hassle out of payroll by automatically calculating and filing all of your payroll deductions and payroll taxes, including federal, state and local taxes, as well as W-2, W-4 and 1099 forms.\n\nRippling’s time-tracking data can automatically populate into your payroll. Source: Rippling\n\nADP\n\nPayroll processing: Businesses that want to partner with ADP as a PEO must use ADP’s payroll solution. However, companies can also use ADP’s payroll platform as a stand-alone product for U.S. and global payroll without a co-employment model.\n\nTax services: ADP offers payroll tax filing as well as business expense tax registration services.\n\nBenefits administration: ADP’s comprehensive employee benefits can sync with its payroll platform.\n\nOptional payroll features: Additional payroll options include audit and reconciliation services, multi-jurisdiction payroll, and state unemployment insurance management.\n\nDid You Know?Did you know\n\nADP has a helpful feature that can walk employees through the benefits administration process and assist them with choices and applications.\n\nBest for Payroll\n\nADP\n\nAlthough both Rippling and ADP offer comprehensive domestic and global payroll processing and tax filing, we found ADP's payroll and benefits slightly more comprehensive. We were impressed with ADP's optional features, like audit and reconciliation services, multi-jurisdiction payroll, and state unemployment insurance management. We also like that ADP offers robust and affordable employee benefits and a range of tiered payroll plans.\n\nADP’s plan comparison tool can help employees choose the best benefits options. Source: ADP\n\nUsability\n\nRippling\n\nWe found Rippling’s interface and customizable workflows intuitive and straightforward; the platform is easy to use and navigate, and helps to streamline HR processes. We like that the unified system centralizes HR, IT and finance data in one place for efficient management. We were also impressed that Rippling can automate many HR functions.\n\nADP\n\nADP’s customizable HR platform helps businesses tailor a solution to their specific needs. We like that the ADP Marketplace facilitates seamless integrations with hundreds of third-party solutions. Additionally, ADP’s iOS and Android mobile apps offer convenient access on the go.\n\nBest for Usability\n\nRippling\n\nDuring testing, we were pleased to find that both Rippling and ADP offer intuitive products with clean interfaces. However, we were especially impressed with Rippling's ability to automate so many HR functions. While this does add some time and effort on the front end to customize the solution, it can ultimately save your HR professionals countless hours by eliminating repetitive HR tasks.\n\nCustomer Support\n\nRippling\n\nRippling offers standard email and web chat support. Users must pay to add Rippling’s HR Help Desk: HR Support if they want direct access to phone support. Rippling also offers basic online resources, like templates, blogs and a help center.\n\nADP\n\nWe like that ADP’s plans automatically include phone, email and web chat support and that users can access a dedicated HR representative. For further support, ADP users can also connect with HR experts and access online resources.\n\nBest for Customer Support\n\nADP\n\nThis was another close call, but ADP's customer support came out on top. We like that ADP is IRS- and ESAC-certified; Rippling is not. ADP also offers phone support, whereas Rippling users must pay extra for that feature.",

      "# [A fintech collapse is rippling through a small corner of the banking world by David Hollerith on 2024-07-01](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-fintech-collapse-is-rippling-through-a-small-corner-of-the-banking-world-143054499.html)\nThe unraveling of fintech upstart Synapse is rippling through a small corner of the banking world, leaving thousands of customers without access to their money and a mystery about millions of dollars that went missing.\n\nFour small US banks have some of the money. No one is sure where the rest went.\n\nThe saga surrounding the bankruptcy of Synapse, a 10-year-old fintech firm, puts a new spotlight on how loose webs of partnerships between venture-backed upstarts and FDIC-backed lenders can go so wrong.\n\nRegulators are more closely scrutinizing these relationships and warning various banks to tighten their controls when working with fintech firms.\n\nEarlier this month, the Federal Reserve slapped one of Synapse’s partner banks with an enforcement action that identified risk management weaknesses surrounding such partnerships.\n\nRead more: What is a neobank and is it safe?\n\n'Banking as a service'\n\nSynapse was part of a wave of new fintech firms that emerged in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis as Silicon Valley-style digital banking upstarts promised to shake up the world of traditional finance.\n\nIn just a decade it became a major middleman between dozens of fintech companies and community banks by offering what it called \"banking as a service.\"\n\nIt provided digital banking outfits like Mercury, Dave (DAVE), and Juno with access to checking accounts and debit cards they could offer their customers. It was able to do this by partnering with FDIC-backed banks that, in return, got a new source of deposits and fee revenue.\n\nThe traditional lenders that partnered with Synapse included Evolve Bank & Trust, American Bank, AMG National Trust, and Lineage Bank, all small banks compared with giants like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) or Bank of America (BAC).\n\nThe largest was Evolve, which had roughly $1.5 billion in assets at the end of the first quarter.\n\nThe pitch that Synapse effectively gave to these smaller banks was \"we’ll bring in the deposits; you don’t have to do much,\" according to Jason Mikula, an independent fintech consultant who publishes a weekly newsletter and has followed Synapse.\n\n\"This turned out not to be accurate, in my opinion,\" Mikula added.\n\nThe problems surfaced shortly after Synapse filed for bankruptcy in April when it could not reach an agreement with Evolve on a settlement of funds.\n\nThree weeks into the bankruptcy proceedings, Synapse cut off Evolve's access to its technology system. That, in turn, forced Evolve and the other partner banks to freeze customer accounts.\n\nBoth parties blamed each other as the culprit.",
      "# [What to Make of Rippling's Payroll Optional Decision](https://www.outsail.co/post/hr-tech-download---april-2024)\nRippling made waves this week as TechCrunch reported the startup is raising another $870M in cash, on the heels of a $500M raise in 2023.\n\nAnd although this news will receive all of the headlines, there is another recent piece of Rippling news that I find even more interesting:\n\nRippling recently decided to make its payroll module an optional feature, a surprising shift since payroll has been a required module since the company's founding in 2016.\n\nThis decision may not sound groundbreaking on the surface, but this decision may give us some unique insight into Rippling's strategy and future plans.\n\nLet's dissect this decision to understand the potential implications for Rippling and the HR Tech industry at large.\n\nA Bold Strategy for Growth\n\nAt first glance, making payroll optional appears to align Rippling more closely with some of its aspirational enterprise heroes like Workday, Oracle HCM Cloud, and SAP SuccessFactors.\n\nThese behemoths have long viewed payroll as a complementary offering, not the core of their value proposition. Workday, Oracle and SAP focus on providing a robust permissions, workflow automation, and analytics backbone, often deferring the intricacies of payroll to specialized providers, like ADP or Dayforce.\n\nFor Rippling, this decision could be viewed as a calculated step towards becoming a high-margin, SaaS-centric business, distancing itself from the intensive, lower-margin services that payroll processing demands.\n\nThis shift aligns with Rippling's Silicon Valley ethos of scaling quickly, leveraging software for high-margin returns, and reducing dependency on service-heavy, complex processes.\n\nIn essence, Rippling could be repositioning itself for the kind of exponential, high-margin growth its investors crave, focusing on its strengths in workflow automation and data management with Rippling Unity.\n\nThe Risks of Turning Away from Payroll\n\nAs I've watched Rippling evolve from a promising start-up to a hypergrowth, venture capital heavyweight, I've been asking myself one big question:\n\n\"Does Parker Conrad have the patience to do the unsexy work that is required to succeed in this space?\"\n\nPayroll, with its intricate web of compliance, tax, and workforce management issues, represents the less glamorous but utterly essential heart of HR services.\n\nThis departure from a full-service offering could be interpreted as a reluctance to engage in the painstaking, iterative work necessary to master payrollâa cornerstone of HR Tech.\n\nWhile this decision could launch Rippling on the Workday, SAP and Oracle trajectory to being one of the most valuable companies in the world; the potential downside of this move cannot be overstated either.\n\nThe HR tech landscape, particularly within the SMB and mid-market segments, is fiercely competitive. Without payroll at the heart of its platform, Rippling's differentiation becomes less clear.\n\nHow does Rippling stand apart from HiBob's global HRIS capabilities, BambooHR's affordability, Darwinbox's enterprise experience, or Deel's leadership in global payroll?\n\nEven Lattice is entering the HRIS market this quarter (more on that in next month's newsletter).\n\nA Crossroads for Rippling\n\nRippling's decision to make payroll optional is not merely a business strategy shift; it can also be viewed as a statement of intent and possibly an acknowledgment of the challenges inherent in payroll processing.\n\nThis decision might be pragmatic, considering the technological and service demands of the payroll domain, but it also could introduce a strategic vulnerability.\n\nAnd, of course, it's crucial to remind ourselves that making payroll optional does not equate to Rippling abandoning the payroll field altogether.\n\nThat being said, the decision does make it easier for established providers like ADP, Paycom, Paylocity and Paycor to poke holes in Rippling's ability to be a one-stop shop for all HR needs.\n\nIt is easy to picture a sales rep at one of those companies saying, \"Rippling's most complex customers use us for their payroll. Are you sure you want to put all your eggs in that basket?\"\n\nLooking Ahead"

    "# Comprehensive Report on Rippling\n\n## Company Overview\nRippling, founded in 2016 by Parker Conrad and Prasanna Sankar, is a San Francisco-based workforce management platform that integrates human resources (HR), information technology (IT), and finance into a single system. The company aims to streamline employee management by consolidating various workforce systems, such as payroll, benefits, and device management, into one platform. This approach allows businesses to manage their employee data more efficiently and effectively, which is critical for operational success [(Loizos, TechCrunch, 2024-04-22)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/ripplings-parker-conrad-on-the-companys-brand-new-round-its-brand-new-sf-lease-and-also-its-brand-new-critic/).\n\nAs of April 2024, Rippling has raised a total of $1.2 billion in funding, with its latest Series F round bringing in $200 million and valuing the company at $13.5 billion [(PYMNTS, 2024-04-22)](https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2024/rippling-raises-200-million-to-enhance-workforce-management-platform/). The company has also signed agreements to repurchase up to $590 million in equity from current and former employees and early investors [(Conrad, Rippling, 2024-04-22)](https://www.rippling.com/blog/rippling-announces-series-f-fundraising-and-tender-offer).\n\n## Recent Developments\n### Fundraising and Valuation\nRippling's recent Series F funding round was led by Coatue, with participation from Founders Fund, Greenoaks, and new investor Dragoneer. The round included a significant secondary component, allowing early investors and employees to cash out some of their shares [(Loizos, TechCrunch, 2024-04-22)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/ripplings-parker-conrad-on-the-companys-brand-new-round-its-brand-new-sf-lease-and-also-its-brand-new-critic/). This funding will be used to expand Rippling's market presence and enhance its research and development (R&D) efforts, particularly in building new products [(Conrad, Rippling, 2024-04-22)](https://www.rippling.com/blog/rippling-announces-series-f-fundraising-and-tender-offer).\n\n### Expansion Plans\nRippling is expanding its operations significantly, including a new 123,000-square-foot headquarters in San Francisco, which is the second-largest office lease signed in the city this year [(D'Onfro, SFGATE, 2024-04-05)](https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/tech-firm-office-space-downtown-sf-rippling-19385805.php). Additionally, the company is set to triple its footprint in New York City, creating 390 new jobs and investing $29 million in R&D over the next decade [(Governor Hochul, 2024-04-22)](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-state-investment-tech-firm-ripplings-expansion-lower-manhattan).\n\n## Product Information\nRippling's platform is designed to automate and streamline various HR functions, including onboarding, payroll, benefits administration, and IT asset management. The system integrates with over 500 applications, providing a centralized source of truth for employee data [(PYMNTS, 2024-04-22)](https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2024/rippling-raises-200-million-to-enhance-workforce-management-platform/). The platform's core thesis is that maintaining accurate employee data across disconnected systems is crucial for business efficiency, and Rippling addresses this challenge by allowing changes to propagate automatically across all systems [(Conrad, Rippling, 2024-04-22)](https://www.rippling.com/blog/rippling-announces-series-f-fundraising-and-tender-offer).\n\n### Recent Changes to Product Offering\nIn a notable strategic shift, Rippling has made its payroll module optional, a departure from its previous model where payroll was a required feature. This decision aligns Rippling more closely with enterprise software giants like Workday and SAP, which view payroll as a complementary offering rather than a core service [(Outsail, 2024-04-22)](https://www.outsail.co/post/hr-tech-download---april-2024). This move may position Rippling for higher-margin growth but also raises questions about its differentiation in a competitive HR tech landscape [(Outsail, 2024-04-22)](https://www.outsail.co/post/hr-tech-download---april-2024).\n\n## Executive Insights\nParker Conrad, the CEO and co-founder of Rippling, has expressed gratitude for the support from investors and employees, emphasizing the importance of their contributions to the company's growth. He noted that the recent funding round was initially intended to provide liquidity for employees but expanded due to strong investor interest [(Loizos, TechCrunch, 2024-04-22)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/ripplings-parker-conrad-on-the-companys-brand-new-round-its-brand-new-sf-lease-and-also-its-brand-new-critic/). Conrad has also highlighted the company's commitment to R&D, stating that Rippling plans to invest significantly in this area to enhance its product offerings and maintain a competitive edge [(Conrad, Rippling, 2024-04-22)](https://www.rippling.com/blog/rippling-announces-series-f-fundraising-and-tender-offer).\n\n## Market Position and Competition\nRippling operates in a crowded HR tech market, competing with established players like Zenefits, Paycor, Workday, and Gusto. However, Rippling differentiates itself by offering a broad suite of integrated products that go beyond traditional HR functions, including IT and finance solutions [(Loizos, TechCrunch, 2024-04-22)](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/ripplings-parker-conrad-on-the-companys-brand-new-round-its-brand-new-sf-lease-and-also-its-brand-new-critic/). The company's focus on automation and data management positions it well for businesses looking to streamline their operations and improve efficiency.\n\n## Conclusion\nRippling is poised for significant growth with its recent funding, expansion plans, and strategic product developments. The company's innovative approach to workforce management and commitment to R&D could solidify its position as a leader in the HR tech space. Prospective candidates and investors should consider Rippling's strong market presence, ambitious growth strategy, and the potential for high-margin returns as key factors in their decision-making process."
