      "# [When Humans Are Needed](https://humandata.mercor.com/background-reading/when-humans-are-needed)\nOnce you know you need data and what type of data you need specifically, you’ll have a choice between collecting the data with humans or leveraging a synthetic data solution. This article provides a brief history of how humans got involved in the process in the first place and then discusses where humans and synthetic data shine.\n\nAt a high level, you should be using humans when:\n\nYou want to push the overall frontier of model capabilities beyond best-in-class today\n\nYou want to improve or fine-tune specific capabilities beyond what a model can do today\n\nYou want to measure the performance of an AI system\n\nYou may not need humans when:\n\nImprovements in prompt engineering are still able to make a difference\n\nYou want to catch up to frontier models to have a solid baseline\n\nA brief history - making LLMs useful and intuitive\n\nA few years ago, it started to be possible to train incredibly large language models thanks to advances in model architecture (Transformers) and advancements in parallel computing (GPUs). Once the world started to have models that could reliably predict the next several words (the GPT-2 and 3 era), it became important to figure out how to actually make them useful for humans.\n\nGoing back to 2020 when GPT-3 was first coming out, it was a bit challenging to work with.\n\nConsider a prompt such as\n\nCan you translate from English to French: I want to go to the park.\n\nGPT-3 would often respond with something along the lines of\n\nCan you translate from English to French: I want to go to the park because it is a nice day today.\n\ninstead of doing the translation!\n\nEnter Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback, or RLHF. While there are many aspects of Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback, the basic premise is that humans are used to help the model understand and reward models that align with human preferences.\n\nRLHF can be roughly boiled down into two key ingredients,\n\nHaving humans rank multiple model outputs for the same prompt effectively teaches the model how to rank its own responses.\n\nHaving humans write the “ideal” completion to create a fine-tuning dataset demonstrates to the model what a great response looks like.\n\nRLHF is very effective at aligning the largest foundational models in the world today.\n\nFitting in Synthetic Data\n\nIn its purest form, the idea of synthetic data is to start replacing the parts of the process where humans are contributing their insights with an AI model. A term that is gaining popularity is RLAIF (vs. RLHF where the “AI” and “H” for human are swapped).\n\nLess helpful for building frontier models\n\nWhile research is evolving quickly, one of the core principles of synthetic data is that it’s generally thought to not be possible to exceed the current frontier model with synthetic data alone. This is because the model used to produce the synthetic data will still have errors and is not perfectly aligned. When using synthetic data, all of the existing biases and quirks in the “teacher” model will make their way into the model being trained.\n\nFurthermore, getting a bit technical, models tend to prefer their own style and response types over other models or human feedback, so simply letting the model rank itself on which outputs are best can add significant undesired bias into your training data.\n\nTo push the frontier, you do need actual data from real human beings on topics, modalities, and styles that have not been covered before.\n\nLess helpful for building novel capabilities\n\nWhen you create synthetic data, you are distilling the abilities of the “teacher” model as it relates to the workflows you care about. If you are trying to build a better model than, say, ChatGPT, for your specific use case, then using ChatGPT to generate the synthetic data wouldn’t be very helpful (not to mention, it would be violating OpenAI’s acceptable use policy)\n\nAs an example, consider AI “Agents” that do things in the world - a common challenge today is their ability to break down a problem and generate a plan. The state-of-the-art frontier models at this moment is not sufficiently good at doing this task, and generating sample trajectories from them without more processing or human review is not a feasible way to collect this.\n\nMore helpful for catching up to frontier models\n\nThere are dozens of models today that have surpassed ChatGPT’s initial performance. A common technique in the industry has been to take a leading model and use it to generate the training data for smaller, more efficient models.\n\nThis famously happened when Meta released their initial Llama model, only to be quickly outperformed by Alpaca, and then Vicuna which fine-tuned Llama’s models on derivatives from OpenAI.\n\nAI should still be part of your human process\n\nIt may seem like synthetic data is not that useful for model development given the caveats mentioned, but that doesn’t mean AI models have no place in helping create human data, in fact, quite the contrary!\n\nGenerative AI models are incredibly useful at triaging data, classifying types of errors, and providing sanity checks to their human counterparts.\n\nA best-in-class data annotation system makes thoughtful use of AI and understands the nuances of human and AI interaction.",
      "# [Design a Data Pipeline](https://humandata.mercor.com/how-to/design-a-data-pipeline)\nRegardless of where you are right now in terms of readiness or sophistication, it can be helpful to take a few minutes and review how the world’s leading AI labs and data annotation vendors are constructing their data annotation pipelines today.\n\nYou by no means need all of these components to get started, but we hope that by seeing what’s around the corner, you’ll be able to take small steps towards a more scalable future.\n\nWhile not technical, we’ll be getting fairly far into the weeds of how annotation processes are represented in the labeling platforms and why.\n\nStructuring the work\n\nTasks, Subtasks, Task Stages, Batches, Campaigns, Projects, oh my…\n\nAt a high level, we recommend breaking out the work to be done in the structure below. Having a clean and consistent structure makes everything so much easier to manage. Every team and company will use slightly different vocabulary for these structures, but the overall concepts should remain the same.\n\nBuilding blocks\n\nProjects\n\nProjects are the highest level of organization and can be thought of as a single initiative that a group of annotators with shared expertise will work on.\n\nThe work to be done in a project is similar in nature, but may be broken out into several different campaigns that start and stop at different points, with slightly different goals, instructions, and work to be done.\n\nProjects should be used to assign a pool of talent, so you don’t need to pull your hair out micro-managing adding and removing people from 10 different campaigns each time a personnel change happens.\n\nTracking metrics and setting goals at the project level is pretty challenging, because the quality bar, time per task, and work to be done can all be very different within each campaign.\n\nEarly on, projects may look like a shared Google Drive folder consisting of the different campaign trackers, instructions, and guidance on the nature of the work.\n\nCampaigns\n\nCampaigns should group together similar work, where the instructions and work to be done will not meaningfully change. If big changes are needed to the instructions or the way the task is completed, it’s best to put that in a new campaign.\n\nMetrics, including throughput and quality goals, should be set and measured at the campaign level. Because we want to have at least a somewhat “Apples to Apples” comparison over time, it’s important that we don’t wildly switch up what’s going on within a campaign.\n\nInstructions should be set at a per-campaign level. Your instructions are going to change as time goes on and you collect more feedback and edge cases. I highly encourage instructions to be versioned so you can honestly state what the expectations and guidance were at the time a given set of data was labeled. Data staleness is real, and wondering why a bunch of “off-policy” data is still in the training dataset has bitten many a team.\n\nCandidly, there’s a bit of a balancing act between re-using parts of the instructions across campaigns within a given project. There’s not a great way of doing this in 2024 I’ve found without dedicated tooling, but with the right annotation tooling, instruction component reuse AND versioning do exist harmoniously.\n\nBatches\n\nFor larger campaigns, it can be helpful to further subdivide a campaign into batches.\n\nSome common ways people group tasks into batches are:\n\nDiversity group or use case - It’s a best practice to have a strong opinion about the diversity of data you want collected. Creating batches with a set number of tasks to do is one way to set clear expectations and measure progress on different use cases\n\nDataset origin - If you are creating tasks to enrich an existing dataset or evaluation, making a batch per dataset with the number of tasks you want to be completed from each can make sense\n\nModel version - If you collect user data from a model that you want to annotate, clearly storing the model version or snapshot used can be a way to ensure you are only labeling “on-policy” and recent data and setting expectations about what to do with older data.\n\nCreation date - If you have a long-running campaign of very similar work, dividing it by the week or month it was created allows you to compare cohorts of data over time.\n\nInstruction version - This can be a bit duplicative and we generally recommend keeping instruction versions separate from batches, but some view dividing campaign batches into instruction groups as a way to ensure only helpful, “on-policy” data is being collected.\n\nOne of the more common issues annotation teams face is how to close out batches of data. Oftentimes, there will be a long tail of data that is hard to finish for whatever reason. Setting clear expectations about how to close out batches and when to start new ones with any labeling team or vendor is very important. Sometimes getting 100% completion is really important, but other times closing the batch at less than 100% completion is easier, faster, and preferred. If closing out batches early, you need to watch out for “cherrypicking”, where annotators only do the easy tasks and you never get the diversity or complex cases you had in mind completed.\n\nTasks\n\nA task represents the unit of work to be completed.\n\nInputs and Outputs\n\nThe input of a task, or the work to be done, is fixed and doesn’t change, while the output gets updated as the task goes through its different stages.\n\nTask Statuses\n\nTasks have a task status. Task statuses usually include at least\n\nTodo / Unstarted - A task that has not been picked up for work\n\nCompleted - A task that is ready for data ingestion\n\nSome types of task statuses are more open-ended, such as how to track in-progress work and how to represent the status of reviews.\n\nOur recommendation is to add an “in progress” task status representing that somebody has picked up the task and it is being worked on. This gets into the idea of task “claims”, in other words, how does someone indicate that they will be or are working on a given task?\n\nTracking the task review status can be especially tricky, as tasks may have no reviews and still be ingested, or a single review, or multiple reviews. Heck, tasks can even be reviewed, restarted, and then reviewed again. Our recommendation is to track reviews (and current task stage) independently of the task status.\n\nAn additional nuance on task status is how one marks a task as “Ready for Ingestion”. It can be the case that the annotator has finished the work but it hasn’t been reviewed by a team lead, or the annotator is new and before the client sees the work, we want to spot-check that person to ensure their work can be trusted. “Ready for ingestion” can be its own task status, a task stage, or a stand-alone field on the task that can be filtered.\n\nMetrics\n\nStoring things like time per task or accuracy at a task level can be tricky. What happens if we want to redo the annotation? Does accuracy reflect the state of the first attempt, the latest review that was reviewed by someone else, or something else? A lot of task metrics will make more sense to capture at a per-stage level, and then can be thoughtfully rolled up and summarized at the task level.\n\nMetadata\n\nTask metadata is a great place to store information that makes working with the data after it’s annotated much easier. Metadata typically includes the source of the data and anything that’s going to help you pair up the annotation with the rest of the system you want to plug the data into. When creating net new data from scratch, there may not be much metadata compared to annotating an existing set of data, say, from a data collection flywheel.\n\nInstruction Version\n\nSince your instructions are going to change as you execute your campaign, knowing what the instructions looked like at the time the task was completed can be helpful for filtering which data you want to include, or which data you want to do a targeted update for.\n\nTask Claims\n\nLetting annotators claim tasks they are working on, and assigning tasks to people are important parts of the labeling workflow. This can be accomplished by having a claimed_by and a claimed_until property on the task. Claims can be set when an annotator picks up a task, or they can be assigned in advance to allow only that specific person to pick up the task. The length of the claimed_until period is based on how long the task takes to do, how much work is lost if another person restarts the work, and how consistently annotators log in or engage with the platform.\n\nIt’s usually a best practice to also set a claimed_limit of say, 5-10, at the campaign level so that folks can’t just take all of the easy tasks and leave their peers with the hard ones.\n\nTask Stages\n\nIn order to have accurate metrics for quality and throughput, it’s important that the tracking for the work done is immutable.\n\nIn its most basic form, a corrected task will simply overwrite the output that the previous person created. The challenge is that any feedback, issues with accuracy, proof of work, or error categories now become disconnected from the current task state.\n\nEven on the earliest parts of the sophistication curve, the output from the “attempt” stage must be locked and not changed as reviews are completed. In this simple form, you would have two stages, an “attempt” stage and a “review” stage. This simple bifurcation gets you pretty far, but it stops working if you want to verify reviews with a review, or send tasks back to the “attempt” stage to be re-worked, and then reviewed again. Redoing tasks and verifying reviews is a pretty common thing you’ll want to do.\n\nWe highly recommend adopting a graph approach to task stages and creating a new node each time someone edits (or even looks at, ideally) the task.\n\nInputs and Outputs\n\nEach stage has an immutable input and, once the work is done, an immutable output.\n\nThe input should be the output from the previous stage node if one exists.\n\nMetrics\n\nTask stages are a great place to store lots of metrics, metrics could include the time taken and quality metrics populated from the review of that specific pipeline stage. Task stages are where we want to track all of the actual human work done on the task.\n\nMake sure to track who is doing the work on each specific stage.\n\nTypes of Stages\n\nCommon task stages include:\n\nCreated\n\nAttempt\n\n“Standard Review”\n\n“Super Review” (Maybe a team lead responsible for managing the reviewers)\n\n“Employee Review” (When a researcher or client staff is doing the review)\n\nComplete or “Ready to Use” (can accept tasks from all or some previous stages)\n\nSubtasks\n\nSome types of tasks can be especially complex, such as when you want to use a consensus model to determine the right output, break out a very time-consuming task into smaller pieces, or have multiple people contribute to producing an output that should be reviewed as a whole.\n\nIn cases such as these, you can duplicate the ideas of task stages and task statuses on the subtask, and have the task stage and status be updated based on the statuses of all of the child subtasks (for example, the task becomes complete when all subtask’s task statuses move to complete).\n\nSubtasks, like task stages, are broken out into a graph and can be dynamically created.\n\nIf you think you’ll need subtasks in your life, you can support one task type that has a 1:1 mapping of tasks and subtasks, and another task type that supports the complexity of splitting and merging work across subtasks.\n\nInputs and Outputs\n\nEach stage has an immutable input and, once the work is done, an immutable output.\n\nThe input should be the output from the previous stage node if one exists.\n\nMetrics\n\nTask stages are a great place to store lots of metrics, metrics could include the time taken and quality metrics populated from the review of that specific pipeline stage. Task stages are where we want to track all of the actual human work done on the task.\n\nMake sure to track who is doing the work on each specific stage.\n\nTypes of Stages\n\nCommon task stages include:\n\nCreated\n\nAttempt\n\n“Standard Review”\n\n“Super Review” (Maybe a team lead responsible for managing the reviewers)\n\n“Employee Review” (When a researcher or client staff is doing the review)\n\nComplete or “Ready to Use” (can accept tasks from all or some previous stages)\n\nPutting it all together\n\nImplementing a structured, scalable data pipeline not only enhances the efficiency and quality of your data annotation processes, but it also positions your team to adapt swiftly to evolving project requirements and complexities.\n\nBy leveraging the concepts of projects, campaigns, batches, tasks, subtasks, and stages, you create a flexible yet robust framework. This framework helps ensure that every piece of work is tracked, managed, and reviewed systematically. The ultimate goal is to maintain high standards of quality and efficiency while minimizing bottlenecks and errors.\n\nWhile there can be a lot of components to consider about how to best organize the data within an annotation platform, it’s important that you build to meet your needs. As you continue to refine your data pipeline, remember that the key to success lies in iteration and adaptation. Regularly review your processes, solicit feedback from your team, and stay informed about industry best practices. With a well-structured approach, your data annotation efforts will become much more manageable!\n\nWe hope this guide has provided valuable insights and actionable strategies to help you build a best-in-class data pipeline - we’d love to chat more about this with you!",
      "# [Black Box vs. Open Box](https://humandata.mercor.com/mercors-approach/black-box-vs-open-box)\nExperimentation speedSpend time negotiating with vendors over price per task for each iteration - Play a game of telephones between your research team, the vendors, and annotatorsNo new pricing negotiations every time you kick off a new project, just a flat % - Work directly with annotators when you need to iterate quicklyManagement overheadVendor handles operations, but will likely still need a small team to coordinate with research teams, manage vendors, and assess qualityBuild an internal human data team, but outsource sourcing and managing annotators, and setting up data pipelines and processes to vendors",
      "# [Incentive Structures](https://humandata.mercor.com/mercors-approach/incentive-structures)\nIt’s not simple to define annotator compensation/incentive structures that optimize for\n\nHigh quality\n\nQuick iteration speeds\n\nCost efficiency\n\nRealistically, there will be trade-offs that come with optimizing for any of them.\n\nWe’ll jump into the reasoning, but we generally recommend an hourly pay model over a pay-per-task model, at least when starting out. While it can seem less cost-efficient, it’s much more effective at optimizing for data quality and iteration speeds. Many of the top labs we work with have adopted this model.\n\nWe think that hybrid incentive models do exist, and it’s perfectly OK to still establish expectations even with an hourly model.\n\nWe’re consistently seeing data quality, followed by time to data, as most important to researchers. Generative AI models trained with RLHF are particularly sensitive to bad data inputs, much more so than traditional computer vision or natural language models.\n\nThe bottom line is that a 10% reduction in per-SFT pair cost is not comparable to the cost of having to retrain your model due to low-quality data.\n\nPay per task\n\nIn a “pay per task” model, vendors charge a fixed price per work to be done, for example, per prompt-response pair created.\n\n✅ Pro: Vendor efficiency - Vendors are incentivized to develop processes and tooling to reduce their costs, and in an ideal world, these savings are then passed on to you, the customer.\n\n✅ Pro: Easy math - You’ll know exactly what each data point costs which seems like it would make the life of a procurement team negotiating with and comparing vendors easier, at least until you spend weeks calibrating what that right price per task is, more on that below.\n\n❌ Con: Fast as possible - Annotators are incentivized to complete as many tasks as possible to maximize their take-home earnings. This often looks like taking shortcuts, speeding through instructions, and doing the minimum amount of work required to avoid disciplinary action.\n\n❌ Con: Skewed distribution - Annotators will always be incentivized to choose easier and shorter tasks, so you will end up with a skewed distribution of task complexity. Even if you set different rates based on complexity, it’s not easy to maintain. Practically, this can look like annotators “skipping” the tasks in favor of ones that seem easier.\n\n❌ Con: Micromanagement - Instructions and the work to be done will constantly be in flux, directly impacting the time per task. Per-task pay rates will also need to change to calibrate to the change in work to be done. Without doing this calibration, annotators can feel disincentivized to participate in the new work to be done. Left unbalanced for long enough, you end up with the data annotation pay horror stories that make the rounds in the news.\n\n❌ Con: Slow pricing negotiations - For vendors that do per-task pay, they need to identify what the price per task is, this involves estimating the length of time the task will take, how many reviews or touches the task will get, and what their margin will look like under different scenarios. It can take multiple weeks, a pilot, or more to get the quote correct, greatly reducing your research team’s iteration speed. The worst part is that your instructions are all but guaranteed to change within a month, and when they do, the cost per task will need to be re-priced all over again.\n\n❌ Con: Black box transparency - Because vendors are incentivized to produce the data in the most cost-effective way, there’s no incentive to be transparent about how the data is produced. Vendors are incentivized to find the cheapest labor to produce the output, do the bare minimum review, and keep secret how the annotators are being managed and what the communication to them looks like.\n\nIn summary, the per-task model incentives cost efficiency, at the expense of data quality and time to data.\n\nHourly pay\n\nIn an hourly pay model, you define hourly rates for annotators (generally based on their domain and experience) and pay them for each hour worked. Tools such as Hubstaff are often used to track time spent, as well as provide accountability for how the work was produced.\n\n✅ Pro: Flexible work and quick iteration - The work to be done can change without needing to re-calculate the price per task. Running multiple small experiments, or breaking annotators into groups that do the work slightly differently can all happen seamlessly.\n\n✅ Pro: “Open”-box transparency - Vendors are incentivized to be transparent about designing the review process and coverage percentage that best works for you, the customer.\n\n✅ Pro: Data representation - The incentive to pick only easy and fast tasks is largely gone, annotators can specialize in doing specific types of tasks without worrying about being paid less if that type takes longer. There may be slight pressure still depending on how you measure annotator performance.\n\n✅ Pro: Talent attraction - In a “cost-plus” model, the model Mercor uses, the vendor and client together decide what the right level of compensation is for the talent, and the vendor takes a fixed percentage of that. If highly skilled and compensated annotators are required, there is no incentive to take shortcuts or cut corners that could compromise the skill bar.\n\n❌ Con: Annotator inefficiency - The most obvious downside is that annotators will not be incentivized to be efficient with their time. We think there are several practical ways of managing this, however.\n\nWork with a high-quality team of annotators, with visibility into backgrounds. Experts in their field are less likely to be dishonest to optimize for a little more money.\n\nEnsure annotators are excited and fulfilled by their work. If people are generally happy and believe their work is meaningful, they are far more likely to be efficient. Culture and team energy produce outsized returns.\n\nMonitor time efficiency for each annotator, and manage annotators accordingly if there are obvious outliers.\n\n❌ Con: Over-qualified talent - Vendors can be incentivized to recommend talent that is over-qualified or at a higher pay band than what was strictly required by the market to support.\n\nHybrid models\n\nYou can also adopt a hybrid approach to mitigate the downsides of your selected model, although this will come with some higher overhead.\n\nExample modifications could include:\n\nPer-task bonuses: incentivize higher volume. Combine this with hourly pay to indirectly mitigate the incentive to sit on tasks. Can incentivize speeding through tasks, so could be combined with a quality requirement.\n\nSet max paid time per task: disincentivize excess time per task. Combine this with hourly pay to directly reduce the incentive to sit on tasks. Disincentivizes taking on complex tasks which would take longer than the cap.\n\nModifying per-task pay based on quality: incentivize higher quality with a per-task pay model. Requires defining an objective quality rating, which will likely lead to disputes by annotators and more overhead.\n\nModifying per-task pay based on complexity: improve cost efficiency per-task if done correctly. Requires determining complexity, which is non-trivial. Also will be less transparent to annotators, leading to disputes.\n\nBonuses based on hours targets: incentivizes doing a minimum amount of work each week. Can be less cost-efficient based on how it is set.\n\nWorker classification\n\nFor most human data projects, we recommend hiring annotators as contractors. The major differences between employees and contractors in the United States (can vary by country):\n\nEmployees : Subject to more control over how their work is performed. Often receive benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off. Entitled to certain protections under labor laws, including minimum wage and overtime pay.\n\nIndependent Contractors : Have more autonomy over how they complete their tasks. They bring their own tools, set their own schedules, and may work for multiple clients. However, they do not receive the same benefits and protections as employees.\n\nSince projects can be unpredictable in length, it usually makes sense to classify annotators as independent contractors. This means complying with requirements on autonomy over when and how contractors do their work, what they do with the rest of their time, and more.\n\nBased on the incentive structure you choose, you can face different levels of worker misclassification risk. Mercor handles on your behalf, so you can avoid dealing with risks of misclassification, including financial penalties and legal action.",
      "# [The Secret Mercor Master Plan on 2025-03-03](https://mercor.com/blog/secret-master-plan)\nBrendan Foody\n\nCo-founder / CEO·Mar 03, 2025\n\nImagine a world where Jeff Bezos is a hedge fund investor, Howard Shultz is a salesman, and Reed Hastings is a teacher. That was the world we lived in, not so long ago. These are the jobs they were doing before they found the best use for their talents.\n\nWe founded Mercor because the labor market is the largest, most inefficient market in the world. Better matching people with the work they do everyday is the largest lever on maximizing global utility. While we gained incredible traction with our initial focus on hiring experts to train AI models, this is only the first step in our plan to solve global labor allocation.\n\nThe Wedge\n\nMarketplaces are hard to get off the ground, but if they do take off they become huge. The successful ones have a wedge into a large and pressing unmet need. For Uber, the wedge was black cars. For Airbnb, it was conferences.\n\nWe started 2024 in our apartment with no US employees, under $1M in annual revenue, and only seed companies as customers. Last year we grew 6400% and we now work with the most sophisticated technology companies in the world, making us one of the fastest growing companies in Silicon Valley history.\n\nWe believe we can create hundreds of thousands of jobs with AI labs alone, but that pales in comparison to the billions of knowledge work jobs in the world. The technology that we’re been building is generally applicable.\n\nStructural Inefficiency\n\nLabor inefficiency stems from two structural challenges in the market:\n\nFragmentation – jobs candidates apply to a handful of jobs and companies consider a fraction of a percent of candidates in the market. This is because matching supply and demand needs to be solved manually (and previously in person). Companies manually review resumes, conduct interviews, and predict who they believe will perform well. Human time is the limiting factor. However, if you can solve this matching problem at the cost of software it allows you to interview everyone, making way for a global, unified labor market that every candidate applies to and every company hires from.\n\nImperfect Information – When you order a ride on Uber, you know what you’re getting. When you book an Airbnb, the pictures usually do a pretty good job. When you’re hiring someone, it’s extremely difficult to accurately predict how well they will perform on the job. Imperfect human judgement is embedded within every transaction. While LLMs are not perfect at talent assessment, models are quickly surpassing human capabilities. This trend will continue to make transactions more efficient.\n\nCorrespondingly, our main objectives are to attract high caliber applicants to come to Mercor and accurately predict candidate’s job performance. Achieving these objectives will solve global labor efficiency more broadly.\n\nHiring expert contractors to train AI models is the perfect forcing function on these objectives. First, we collect performance data from AI labs within days, compared to the 3 month lag from a traditional enterprise. This allows us to immediately calibrate on the effectiveness of our models and continuously experiment to find the features predictive of success. Second, we need to hire a broad pool of candidates across all knowledge work jobs (law, consulting, medicine, engineering, etc.). This builds the strength of our talent pool across every professional and academic domain. Third, we will service “unreasonable asks” from AI labs like needing to hire 300 people in two days. These high volume requests for quality people on extremely short timelines can’t be fulfilled with a services operation. They force us to build the automations at each layer of the hiring process to deliver.\n\nHiring for All Work\n\nWe have the largest comparative advantage from automating talent assessment when the ratio of time spent assessing someone relative to the time spent working with them is the highest. When hiring someone for 5 years, it’s easier to interview them manually. When hiring someone for 5 weeks, efficient matching automation creates a huge comparative advantage. Because of this, we’ve started with shorter duration contract work, but will expand progressively towards longer duration, full-time jobs as our technology matures.\n\nSo, in short, the master plan is:\n\nHire people to train AI models\n\nUse those contracts to learn how to predict job performance\n\nExpand to short-duration contract roles\n\nHire people for all jobs\n\nDon’t tell anyone.",
      "# [Announcing Mercor's Series B on 2025-02-20](https://mercor.com/blog/series-b)\nThroughout history, many of humanity’s great minds took a while to find their calling. Jeff Bezos started as a hedge fund investor. Walt Disney was fired as a newspaper editor for “lacking creativity.” Before becoming a priest, Pope Francis worked as a nightclub bouncer. (Yes, really.) In each case, greatness was unlocked by the right person ending up in the right place at the right time. But, tragically, many never do.\n\nThe labor market has consistently been the largest, most inefficient market in the world. That unsolved problem becomes immediate and urgent now as we face the advent of AGI and prepare for the most transformative and challenging period in how human talent is allocated.\n\nAI will change and even displace many traditional careers. At the same time, in other professions, AI will actually create much more need and opportunity for human ability.\n\nWe’re not the first to recognize these changes. But we’re the first to build a scalable solution. Bringing the right talent to these roles — defining “skilled labor” in the AI era — is where we focus our efforts.\n\nOur current focus is on hiring experts to help advance the frontier of AI, but our sights are on every sector.\n\nMercor is two years old and growing more than 51% month over month. Our team includes the former Head of Human Data Operations at OpenAI and the previous Head of Growth at Scale. Over half of us are former founders, and our median age is 22.\n\nOur latest round was led by Felicis, with participation from General Catalyst, DST Global, Benchmark, and Menlo Ventures — and it will accelerate our ability to match billions of people with their calling, applying human talent to its highest potential.\n\nIf this mission resonates with you, we are looking for exceptional individuals — elite engineers, seasoned operators, and former founders — to join us.

I was late for the 12:30 one so had to reschedule it. The interview went good in my opinion. The AI asked some questions from my CV then followed up on the answers that I was giving. For instance I had one side project in my CV so it asked me about it and then asked follow up questions like how will you add authentication to it, etc.\n\nThe interview is only 20 minutes so I would suggest you take your time while answering each of the questions in that way you can save yourself from a long list of questions.\n\n### Comment ID kh8qs3j with +1 score by [(AgentPeeee, Reddit, 2024-01-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/18qhrzl/has_anyone_given_ai_interview_of_mercor/kh8qs3j/) (in reply to ID keyafbl):\nHey, how was it?

And it just asked me questions from my resume, and as i answered the questions, it asked follow up questions based on the answers I provided. \n\nAt one point in the interview i had no idea what the answer was, so I just started talking about a project that I'm currently working on, and know much more about. The ai interviewer said \"Sure, we can talk about this\" and started asking me questions based on it.\n\nThe ai interviewer loves asking questions like \"How would you improve xyz feature in your abc project?\"\n\nIn conclusion I'd say, you have the power to sway the direction of the conversation. Just steer the conversation in the direction you want it to go. Keep speaking about the things you're well-informed on, and the interview will be a breeze.\n\n### Comment ID ku9l9gg with +1 score by [(MinimumNatural8852, Reddit, 2024-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/18qhrzl/has_anyone_given_ai_interview_of_mercor/ku9l9gg/) (in reply to ID khs4e9z):\nWhat was the result?\n\n## Comment ID ksopqoe with +4 score by [(mafizStar, Reddit, 2024-02-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/18qhrzl/has_anyone_given_ai_interview_of_mercor/ksopqoe/) (in reply to ID 18qhrzl):\nMercor is a scam, they're just using our time to train its AI model free of cost.\n\n### Comment ID kuk9j4k with +1 score by [(Otherwise-Outside320, Reddit, 2024-03-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/18qhrzl/has_anyone_given_ai_interview_of_mercor/kuk9j4k/) (in reply to ID ksopqoe):\nExactly lol\n\n### Comment ID kt3hmu3 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/18qhrzl/has_anyone_given_ai_interview_of_mercor/kt3hmu3/) (in reply to ID ksopqoe):\n[removed]\n\n#### Comment ID ku9ld3o with +1 score by [(MinimumNatural8852, Reddit, 2024-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/18qhrzl/has_anyone_given_ai_interview_of_mercor/ku9ld3o/) (in reply to ID kt3hmu3):\nCan we talk?

      "# Post ID 1azkwcp: Mercor interview - John Sharma a scam with AI interview with +269 score by [(teriyaki_tofu1, Reddit, 2024-02-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1azkwcp/mercor_interview_john_sharma_a_scam_with_ai/)\nI recently had an interview with Mercor via LinkedIn. A person by the name of John sharma sent me the invite and stuff. It turned out to be an AI interview which rejected me later.\nSurprisingly there is no digital footprint of John Sharma in reality. His LinkedIn just shows as an employee at Mercor with a random coding related dp. \nThe salary disclosed of 25-30LPA is making the company even more fishy. \nI’ve been reading the company is taking interviews to train its AI model to sell its services as an AI interview bot.\n\nEverything top to bottom is fishy with this company.

After the third interview, i got the confirmation that i had been \"added to the 99-th percentile pre-vetted pool\" (whatever the f-word that is supposed to mean). In addition to the name of the interviewer \"John Sharma\" (they might aswell have used Wolf Gupta, the prodigy), it was outright a red flag due to the following reasons:\n- Being the exact same interview, how did i get selected on the third attempt? was it my camera angle? was it my mic? was it my lighting? i am pretty confident all of them were good enough in all the \"interviews\".\n- When this happened, I was barely with 9 months of full-time experience. How can i even fall in the 99-th percentile of developers, that too globally?\n\nI was still very skeptical until they gave me an interview with a YC startup. The interview went well, except that the interviewer ghosted me afterwards. Now my questions went deeper. Came across the following posts and discussions.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/18qo0g2/is_this_legit_mercor_interview_anyone_ever/ - The comments are filled with obvious bot accounts\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1azkwcp/mercor_interview_john_sharma_a_scam_with_ai/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/18suxu5/is_mercorcom_legitimate/\n\nWhat I can gauge from the above is that they are taking User data to train their AI. Not sure if I did sign a clause to allow them to use my data for training, but capitalism.\n\n\nNot only is that the issue, they seem to be promoting another scam, Remotasks. Where anyone who has a degree is super under-qualified\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHey\n\nWe’ve shortlisted you for an exciting opportunity with Remotasks (a subsidiary of Scale AI) because you passed our AI interview and have an impressive background. This role would pay 20 USD/hr.\n\nHere is a description of the role:\n•⁠  ⁠Remotasks (a subsidiary of Scale AI) is looking for experienced software engineers to complete data generation tasks to improve the performance of cutting-edge AI models.\n•⁠  ⁠These tasks involve receiving a prompt that a model is unable to properly answer (for example, “plot the Mandelbrot set in Python”). Your responsibility will be to complete these tasks each day by writing both high quality code and an English explanation of your work.\n•⁠  ⁠Each task takes anywhere from 1-4 hours to complete and you will have the flexibility to finish them on your own time. The total workload is 40 hours per week.\n•⁠  ⁠If you excel in this role, you may be promoted to higher-paying opportunities by Remotasks and the Scale AI team in a management role.\n\nIf this opportunity excites you, please confirm your availability (meaning: when can you start working) to work 40 hours a week. We can arrange to send you the final short assessment. \n\nRegards\n\nXYZ Person\n\nRecruitment Manager @ Mercor.com\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have hid the name of the person who sent me this (unless public demand), but it is someone who has not even finished college yet.

Mercor is building ai interview tech. Many of these positions they advertise and the interviews that follow are to train that ai. They are not forthcoming about that and are using people who are job searching for this. Just do a search on Mercor and you'll see I'm not the only one saying this. \n\nYes, this is very scummy and unethical.

They use an AI interview instead of a real interview in the recruiting process. Most of their jobs are part time short contracting positions to label LLM data for other companies (not its own model).

Perhap if you stick with it long enough you may eventually get some money from them, but it will be far less than originally promised, and after doing many hours of unpaid work.

The work they make you do is pretty light and rewarding especially considering the handsome hourly rate you get for a 100% remote job. I can’t speak on how sustainable the business model is, but I do find it crazy how they are raising so much funding in such a short time. I’m assuming they are relying on referrals to keep a steady stream of contractors as you do get paid if you onboard a candidate. However, I’ve never referred anyone yet, and it’s not necessary to do your role. I found the AI interview a bit weird, but it feels more like a behavioral screener. Most roles will have you do some kind of assessment to evaluate if you are actually technically capable of taking the role afterwards that will mirror the real work. \n\nThe fact that the company’s valuation has grown so much so fast still boggles my mind a little bit, but the work is real and the pay is really good so 🤷‍♂️\n\n### Comment ID me6wzw6 with +3 score by [(talkingteapot, Reddit, 2025-02-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1iu5qxv/mercor_why_dont_job_seekers_speak_good_stuff_if/me6wzw6/) (in reply to ID me4l60p):\nThat’s cool congrats.

Investors were excited about the Internet. One reason they were excited was Yahoo's revenue growth. So they invested in new Internet startups. The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo to get traffic. Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and further convinced investors the Internet was worth investing in.\"\n\n[https://paulgraham.com/yahoo.html](https://paulgraham.com/yahoo.html)\n\nLLM Labs is channeling large amounts of capital received from VCs into RLHF providers. In other words, the revenue of companies like Mercor and Scale AI is essentially the very funds that VCs have invested in LLM Labs.  \nInvestors fail to recognize this money flow and continue to invest, making this a kind of Ponzi scheme.\n\nFurthermore, while Mercor's founders publicly refer to their revenue as \"ARR,\" it is not truly recurring revenue. The moment R&D investments in LLMs decline, their revenue will decrease accordingly.\n\n## Comment ID midplr1 with +1 score by [(Ok_Ad962, Reddit, 2025-03-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1iu5qxv/mercor_why_dont_job_seekers_speak_good_stuff_if/midplr1/) (in reply to ID 1iu5qxv):\nI don’t understand one thing, how are they different from hirevue. Hirevue already uses some sort of algorithm to choose candidates anyway. Once (if they are not already) hirevue uses AI in their software, these kids run out of business."

      "# [Harvard College Dropout's AI-Recruitment Startup Mercor Receives $2 Billion Valuation on 2025-03-14](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/3/14/mercor-valuation-2-bil/)\nWhen Adarsh S. Hiremath dropped out of Harvard in his sophomore year to work on his startup Mercor — an artificial intelligence-powered hiring platform — he had not raised any money for his project.\n\n“I wouldn’t say there was some specific logical thing that gave me the confidence to pursue Mercor,” he said. “It was more so just an emotional pull, right, that feeling that you want to be working on the problem, you want to be working with the people that you’re working with, and it just feels right in terms of an opportunity to spend a bunch of time working on and dedicating your whole life to.”\n\nA year later, in March 2024, Hiremath and his startup’s co-founders — Brendan Foody and Surya Midha — received $100,000 from the Thiel Fellowship, a two-year program offering enterprising students access to professional networks to grow their startups under the condition that they drop out of college.\n\nNow, their hiring platform has expanded their client base to include big-name companies like Open-AI, and in February, Mercor received a valuation of $2 billion dollars from venture capital firm Felicis, raising $100 million more to continue to build out their platform.\n\nThe founders hope to one day build a “unified global labor marketplace,” Hiremath said.\n\n“If you want to hire anyone for any job, you come to Mercor because it’s the best place to do that,” Hiremath added.\n\nMercor uses AI to automate the hiring process, from resume screening to interviewing and payroll management. Hiremath said that the idea for the startup came to him and his co-founders during a software development shop, when they realized that finding personnel to build software for startups can often be difficult and time consuming.\n\n“A startup would come to us with a request for some type of software they’d want built, and then we’d build it with a team that we recruited,” Hiremath said.\n\n“And very, very quickly, we realized that the magic was actually in the really, really exceptional people that we’re finding,” he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInitially, the company focused on recruiting software engineers and technology professionals for other startups to build and develop software. But Mercor has since broadened its horizons to serve companies looking to recruit from a much wider talent pool.\n\n“We grew north of 40 percent month over month, all of 2024,” he said. “That growth is actually only accelerating into 2025.”\n\nHiremath said that Mercor’s customers, including OpenAI among other artificial intelligence labs and hyperscalers, “really, really rely on Mercor for their needs.”\n\nDespite the funding, Mercor’s employee base has remained small, located in San Francisco and India. According to Hiremath, Mercor does not even have a sales team.\n\n“The sales team is just the founding team and a couple of members of our team, and the customer inbound has been sort of crazy,” he said.\n\nWith Mercor’s continuing growth, Hiremath doesn’t see himself returning to Harvard to complete his computer science degree anytime soon. Both Foody and Midha officially withdrew from Georgetown at the same time that Hiremath dropped out of Harvard.\n\n“It’s not really something I’ve thought about yet,” Hiremath said. “I think the main way that I’ve wrapped my head around it is that Mercor is just such an incredible and exciting opportunity, and I want to spend 100 percent of my time focusing on that.”\n\n“I’ll be sticking with Mercor forever,” he added. The vision that we have is just incredibly large and will take a lot of time and blood, sweat and tears to execute on.”\n\nFor students interested in pursuing a similar path, Hiremath’s advice is to avoid thinking there is a set path for reaching your goals.\n\n“It can be very, very easy to sort of rationalize a set of prerequisites, right? ‘I need to do this before starting a company, I need to do that before joining an early stage startup’ and stuff like that,” Hiremath said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“My piece of advice would be to not choose the deferred life path and instead jump into things,” he added.",

Since launching, Mercor has processed 300,000 candidates and conducted more than 100,000 interviews.\n\n\"At a high level, Mercor is training models that predict how well someone will perform on a job better than a human can,\" CEO Brendan Foody said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday morning.\n\nThe company trains AI models to make hiring decisions similarly to how a human would review a resume, conduct interviews and make recommendations. Foody said the company's clients include top AI labs, but declined to confirm the names of the customers.\n\nThe new round of capital will allow Mercor to invest further on the supply side of its marketplace, Foody said, and to further develop the company's AI technologies that vet candidates and improve predictions.\n\n\"We have a lack of data in driving the outcomes that we care about, and it just makes sense to look at the things that drive the outcomes we care about,\" Foody said.\n\nFoody said Mercor has grown more than 51% in revenue month over month over the past six months and is currently seeing the most in-demand jobs in sectors including software engineering, medicine, law and banking.\n\nThe company is profitable, he added, with a revenue run rate above $75 million.\n\nAs the company looks to a future of AI with more applications across sectors, Foody said he sees potential for the technology to be used more broadly, including in higher education.\n\n\"I think it's almost certain that in the imminent future, all of this will converge towards a completely automated process, not only because it's dramatically cheaper, but more importantly because it's just a far, far more effective process than any process that a human could do,\" Foody said.",

The round was led by Victor Lazarte and Bill Gurley at Benchmark, with participation from General Catalyst, Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, Adam D’Angelo, Larry Summers, Chris Re, and others.\n\nIn addition to the investment, Victor Lazarte at Benchmark will join the board to continue supporting Mercer’s growth and development.\n\nThe funding will enable the company to broaden its operations and extend its market presence.\n\nHow was the idea born?\n\nMercor was founded by high school friends Brendan Foody, Adarsh Hiremath, and Surya Midha. They met in high school in the Bay Area doing competitive debate, and began ideating on company-building as college freshmen at Georgetown and Harvard. In 2023, they dropped out and began building Mercor. Earlier this year, all three founders received the Thiel Fellowship.\n\nWhat does the company do?\n\nSince its launch, the company has added over 300,000 people to their candidate pool and created thousands of jobs globally. The team uses AI models to better assess a candidate’s skill set and predict their ability to perform well in a given role.\n\nTo celebrate their recent progress and funding announcement, Mercor is offering free resume and interview feedback for everyone, a resource that has been traditionally unattainable or expensive for candidates. The company’s AI-powered platform efficiently reviews extensive candidate profiles, conducts personalised interviews, and connects job seekers with suitable opportunities. With this approach, it aims to eliminate the biases and inefficiencies that plague traditional recruitment methods.\n\n“We believe that every applicant deserves the opportunity to be interviewed when applying for jobs,” said Brendan Foody, Mercor’s co-founder and CEO. “The current hiring process selects candidates based on traditional resume signals, and not human ability. AI can do better.”",

      "# [Mercor's $2B Surge Shakes AI Hiring Market as Project-Based Work Takes Over by Jane Park, CTOL Digital Business and Technology News on 2025-02-20](https://www.ctol.digital/news/mercor-2b-valuation-ai-hiring-project-based-work/)\nMercor's $2B Valuation: Game-Changer or AI Hype Bubble?\n\nThe Bold Rise of Mercor: A Startup Betting Big on AI Hiring\n\nMercor, an AI-driven recruitment platform founded by three Thiel Fellows—CEO Brendan Foody, CTO Adarsh Hiremath, and COO Surya Midha—has just secured $100 million in Series B funding, bringing its valuation to a staggering $2 billion. The round, led by Felicis, included participation from heavyweight investors like Benchmark, General Catalyst, and DST Global, all of whom had backed the company since its early days.\n\nLaunched in 2023, Mercor’s AI platform automates key hiring functions such as resume screening, candidate matching, interviews, and even payroll management. The company boasts an impressive $75 million annual revenue run rate, growing at 50% month-over-month. With its primary clients being AI labs—including OpenAI—Mercor has processed over 468,000 job applicants, drawing the majority of its talent pool from India, followed by the U.S.\n\nWhile the company started with a strong focus on tech roles, its ambitions are expanding into consulting, finance, medicine, and law. But with rapid growth comes scrutiny: Can Mercor sustain its momentum? Will AI-driven recruitment truly replace traditional hiring models, or are we witnessing another overhyped AI play?\n\nHiring Reinvented: The AI Takeover of HR Tech\n\nThe Explosive Growth of AI-Powered Hiring\n\nThe global recruitment technology market is undergoing a transformation, fueled by automation, data analytics, and AI adoption. With companies under pressure to streamline hiring while securing top talent, AI-powered recruitment platforms are in high demand. Market forecasts suggest that AI-driven hiring solutions could soon dominate HR tech, a sector expected to grow into the tens of billions.\n\nA Workforce No Longer Tied to 9-to-5 Jobs\n\nBeyond automation, the workforce itself is changing. Traditional full-time employment is giving way to fractional and project-based work, a model that AI-driven platforms like Mercor could accelerate. Employers are increasingly looking for precision in hiring, seeking candidates with specialized skills for short-term engagements. This trend aligns with Mercor’s vision of a more agile labor market driven by algorithmic decision-making.\n\nMercor’s Winning Edge: How It Stands Out from the Crowd\n\nAn All-in-One AI Hiring Machine\n\nUnlike traditional Applicant Tracking Systems that only handle portions of the recruitment process, Mercor’s platform is designed as an end-to-end hiring solution. It automates everything—from resume screening to candidate interviews—offering an AI-first alternative to traditional hiring methods.\n\nTackling Hiring Bias with AI (But Does It Really Work?)\n\nMercor claims its platform reduces bias in hiring, an area where human-driven recruitment often falls short. While AI bias remains a widely debated issue, the company argues that its algorithms improve candidate-job matching by relying on performance data rather than subjective human judgment. The real test will be whether these AI models can consistently outperform traditional hiring practices across diverse industries.\n\nExpanding Beyond Tech: The Race for New Talent Markets\n\nInitially focused on software engineers and AI talent, Mercor is rapidly expanding into other high-value professional sectors like finance, healthcare, and law. This diversification could significantly widen its total addressable market , but also presents challenges in adapting its AI models to vastly different hiring dynamics.\n\nA Startup Backed by Tech Titans\n\nMercor’s young leadership team—average age 22—has managed to attract an elite roster of investors, including Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, and Adam D’Angelo. The company’s impressive revenue trajectory suggests early product-market fit, but maintaining this pace will require exceptional execution.\n\nThe War for AI Recruiting Supremacy: Who’s in the Lead?\n\nCan HR Tech Giants Adapt Fast Enough?\n\nGreenhouse, Lever, and SmartRecruiters have long dominated ATS software. While they are adding AI features, their reliance on legacy systems could slow full-scale AI adoption.\n\nLinkedIn Talent Solutions benefits from vast data and network effects but is not yet a pure AI recruitment solution.\n\nThe AI-Powered Upstarts Challenging the Status Quo\n\nHireVue focuses on AI-driven video interviews.\n\nPymetrics leverages cognitive assessments for hiring.\n\nMya Systems and Beamery specialize in AI-powered talent engagement.\n\nMercor’s Biggest Threat: Itself\n\nMercor’s biggest challenge is not competition, but execution. Scaling from tech hiring to broader industries requires refining AI models to understand domain-specific skills, compliance requirements, and hiring nuances. If its automation fails to match the effectiveness of experienced human recruiters, HR departments may hesitate to fully embrace its platform.\n\nMercor’s Meteoric Rise: Built to Last or Just Another AI Bubble?\n\nWhat’s Fueling the Frenzy?\n\n$75M ARR & Rapid Growth: Few early-stage startups scale this quickly.\n\nTop-Tier Partnerships: Working with OpenAI and other leading AI labs is a major validation.\n\nInvestor Endorsement: A near 8x valuation jump in a year shows significant confidence.\n\nRed Flags Investors Are Watching\n\nRetention & Churn: Does Mercor’s AI actually improve long-term hiring outcomes, or are companies cycling through candidates at a higher rate?\n\nScalability Risks: Can its AI models adapt beyond tech hiring without sacrificing accuracy?\n\nMarket Fatigue: With countless AI-driven hiring tools emerging, will HR leaders see Mercor as indispensable or just another option?\n\nThe AI Hiring Revolution: What’s Next for Mercor and the Industry?\n\n1. Work Will Become More Project-Based, Less Full-Time\n\nMercor’s biggest long-term impact may not be in automating hiring but in reshaping how companies view employment. As AI improves candidate-job matching, we could see a fundamental shift from full-time hiring to fractional, project-based engagements. Companies will increasingly prefer to hire specialists for specific projects rather than commit to long-term employment.\n\n2. Governments Will Clamp Down on AI Bias and Hiring Laws\n\nAs AI hiring gains traction, regulators will demand greater transparency in algorithmic decision-making. Bias audits, explainability requirements, and compliance with global privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA) will become standard. Any missteps here could create serious reputational risks for Mercor and similar platforms.\n\nHR tech incumbents won’t sit idly by. Expect major ATS providers to either integrate AI-first solutions or acquire startups like Mercor to stay competitive.\n\n4. AI Won’t Replace Recruiters, But It Will Change Their Role\n\nAI will increasingly assist rather than replace recruiters, handling time-consuming tasks like resume screening and initial assessments while leaving final hiring decisions to humans.\n\nWill Mercor Define the Future of Hiring?\n\nMercor sits at the crossroads of AI disruption and workforce transformation. Its rapid rise, elite investor backing, and strong early traction make it one of the most intriguing startups in HR tech today. However, the real test will be whether its AI-powered hiring can outperform traditional methods at scale and across industries.",
