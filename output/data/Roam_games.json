Submitting was painful and hung up several times on the scoring step, leaving us to retake pictures since I couldn’t use the one we just just took.  The hunt was out of date as a couple of the features have changed.  And one of the challenges was a bit odd… it asked for an updated cover picture for Tiber Park, but Tiber Park wasn’t the destination and was not nearby.  \n\nI like the ideas and think doing this in other cities could be fun, but the app experience really killed much of the fun.",

Nor could we figure out how to begin the hunt…. and yes, we were literally on the phone with their customer service and they couldn't even get the other player to join.  They said they’re going to refund one ticket.  Like another 1 star review said, sooooo much other stuff all over the app that it’s difficult to even figure out how to play.

My husband got this for my birthday. While at dinner we all opened the app and tried to join. There is so much other junk on the app not related to the event that it is difficult to figure out where to go for what you need. Not user friendly at all. We finally join but then all of us had issues. My app crashed every time I clicked the event button. Another friend couldn’t join at all. My husband finally got the first bar so we walked over and got a drink. We decided to just do the challenges he was seeing since no one else could join, but the camera feature was horrible. It was grainy and super zoomed in when taking a selfie.  It rejected every picture we tried to take as “not what they are looking for”. We finally called the help line. Spent 20 minutes of our time on the call with zero resolution except that she emailed my husband the list of bars and we completed the tour with no challenges (Which was kind of the point. We could have bar hopped on our own.) \nAs for the bars, ours were all really close to each other, which was nice. One of them was shut down. They were all kind of the same style of bar, small, pub style. It would have been nice to have some variety. We walked right past a couple of bars that was super eclectic and fun and would have been neat to have on the list. \nAs a whole, a complete waste of money though. Fun idea, very poorly executed.",

We had 6 people in the team and everyone had loading issues, couldn’t upload photos or videos, and sometimes the app would just crash. \nThe layout of the hunt was poorly done and felt like someone making it didn’t actually play it through, what was supposed to be 1 hour and 3 miles was 6 miles and 2 hours before we gave up. There was no guidance on where to go next and the locations were grouped in such a way that it didn’t make an actual circle. Just plot points on a map. If there was at least a numbering system or a recommended path that would helped significantly. \nThe most frustrating part was every time we opened the map it went to Nigeria and we had to scroll and zoom until we got to Detroit. You couldn’t just pop up the map to find the next location without zooming and scrolling every time. \nLastly there were some things that just no longer existed. The hunt was for murals but in Detroit they can be painted over at any time especially if someone buys the building, so we had to give up on a couple because they just didn’t exist, making us have to no complete the game. \nOverall I would say the app is okay but not great, the game is poorly planned and executed for Detroit, and it’s much too expensive for the overall experience.",

We ended up not getting everyone registered and just starting.\n\nFor each location there are several puzzles, but they are SO easy, the answers are all in the question.  For example, one question was about a year. Something like “in the 1870’s some event happened, add the digits of the building address to get the last digit in the year”.  You have to enter the entire year, but the interface gives you only four numbers to choose from, and you know the first three are 1-8-7, so the remaining one is the last digit. You don’t even have to look for the building address.  The only challenge is when it asks you to go to the next location, but it just gives you a building name and distance, so you either know the area or you don’t, no logic or puzzle to it.   This had the potential to be SO fun.  We bailed part way through.  Some of the challenges are to take a photo of your team here, which are clearly meant to elicit social media posts for the app.  Good thing for them I am only posting my experience here and not all over my social media.",

My son adores scavenger hunts which is one reason he has found Pokémon Go so enthralling. As it turned out only 2 of us could play on the planned day, but my son and I usually Pokémon together so it was all good. We were both eager to begin the hunt.\n\nWe had difficulties connecting him to the game. We called for technical support and received an actual human after very little wait who was able to solve our problem. I had to restart my phone and we signed in all over again, but it worked. Unfortunately, 2 stops into the game, our batteries had drained from 80% to less than 20% in a short time. I provide internet connection for my son allowing him to connect via hotspot. It adds to the power drain but we have always been able to hunt Pokémon this way with few issues. We paused the game (were thankful for the option provided) and stopped for lunch to recharge.\n\nWhen we tried to resume play, we again experienced technical difficulties. My son was excited to be assigned a special role, he chose photographer and was enjoying taking pictures, but he was unable to reconnect and resume. We again called for tech support, again our problems were resolved quickly, but once again we had to restart the hunt from the beginning. This was frustrating and it wasn’t the last of our technical problems.\n\nWe needed a map. While there is one provided in the game, we were unable to zoom in to identify street names. The street name, the distance and a photo were our only clues to locate the next stop. Better maps were available but only through an in-app purchase of coins. I used my Apple Map.\n\nWe enjoyed the prompts for pictures, but again had to leave the game app to access our own camera. We were also encouraged to share on social media which required opening another app. Game play slowed significantly and our batteries drained more quickly.\n\nMy son enjoyed the mini-games and secondary hunts. He completed 3 or 4 and would have done more, however since these also required the use of our cameras, and our batteries were dying fast, he abandoned these fun tasks.\n\nWe stopped one more time to charge our phones. We didn’t mind stopping, we had intended to explore the city and make a day of it. However when we tried to resume and once again my son had trouble reconnecting, our enthusiasm cooled. We continued using only my phone but our interest waned. We abandoned the hunt before it was completed. \n\nI doubt we’ll redeem our other 2 tickets. That’s an expensive loss. It would be fun if it wasn’t so draining.",

When we travel to a new city, it’s so easy to purchase Let’s Roam tickets and start exploring! You can do it anytime and in so many cities across the globe. The app is seamless and if we have any questions the customer service representatives are so nice and helpful! I have only had to call once and they immediately answered my questions.\n \nIt is such a fun activity no matter what the occasion is. They offer scavenger hunts for date nights, bachelorette parties, team building, and birthdays too! My sister is getting married in a few months and we used Let’s Roam for her bachelorette party. She had a BLAST and now her friends want to do the same thing for their bachelorette parties coming up! Not only does it guide you through the city but it also prompts you and your friends with activities and challenges along the way. It’s a perfect set up for an amazing time.\n \nRecently, Let’s Roam launched a dining membership feature too! I LOVE trying new restaurants around the city but it definitely used to put a big hole in my wallet. There are so many amazing restaurants I wanted to hit but would often settle with ramen or a frozen pizza to save some money. With the Let’s Roam Dining Membership, I’ve been able to try 20 new restaurants in the past couple of months! They offer so many different options and have over 50 partnerships with the hottest restaurants in town. I’m definitely giving Let’s Roam Dining Memberships for Christmas gifts this year!",

Only,\n\n1.  Most of the directions were super inaccurate.  At one point they took you into a park but not out and the app actually says “most people get lost here and complain”. Well duh, I wonder why. \n\n2.  They sent us a script for another party because it kept calling our birthday girl (me) by the name Shannan (not my name) \n\n3.  It kept referring to us as being healthcare workers (we are not) at a company we don’t work for, working together on a group mission for fun (but I thought we were at Shannan’s birthday party??) \n\n4.  The grammatical errors were off the charts.  I actually kept thinking they just typoed the word “loss” for “lost” until it popped up again (twice) in the survey:  “at any point were you loss because of directions? “ Are you kidding me? \n\n5.  It made us walk to Pat O’s to start just to send us all the way to the Cathedral.  Just start us at the Cathedral. \n\n6.  It “ended” at Pat O’s and said “your search is now over have a celebratory drink, congrats you have finished” or some such nonsense so we did and then it had three more stops after that including a headstand!  Don’t make us stop and drink if you want us to do a headstand.  It also affected our time because we wasted it because we thought we were done. \n\n7. Questions said they were worth 20 points and when we finished them they were worth 50.\n\n8.  More than one question had multiple right answers but would only allow us to select one, making us get the answer wrong.  The Thriller question was just plain wrong and I have no idea what that has to do with a New Orleans scavenger hunt \n\n9. It took us over a working railroad track and we had to stop and wait for a train.  It also would send us to grassy residential areas and then ask us to take  pictures of a skyscraper and then send us to the CBD and business district and then ask us to headstand on grass. \n\nWhoever wrote this has no knowledge of New Orleans, how to make a good scanner hunt, or how to write. The app was easy to use and the idea novel but that’s all I can give it credit for. I’m a pro writer and would be happy to rewrite this scavenger hunt for you guys (sorry, Shannan, your birthday is over!)",

Interesting idea, poorly executed. There were quite a few spelling mistakes, not many interesting facts, and could have included more interesting places. Additionally, I could not even use the app on my phone. It requires the user to purchase coins to receive a ticket. I was charged three times for the coins because the “server was down.” After all that, I did not even receive any coins. I had to call for a refund the following day, which was perhaps the only pleasant experience I had with this app. I’m not sure why it has received such a high rating.

For what we paid for, it ran horribly and was unclear and confusing. The app has access to the GPS, so I’m not sure why it wouldn’t notify us when we got to each landmark. Not only that, but once we got to the landmark, it was unclear what was a question for the team and what was a challenge for the individual. As a result, we missed half the questions because we didn’t know if it was a challenge or part of the game.

It was fun, informative, and a great activity to do with the family.\n\nHowever, about halfway through the hunt, the scavenger locations started to get further and further apart, and weren’t nearly as interesting as the locations in the first half (like, the final destination asked a question about the color of the slides at a park, as opposed to earlier questions being about historical landmarks). \n\nThe real kicker was the scavenger hunt ended a mile and a half from the starting point (where our car is located). So, instead of looping us back to the start point, the hunt left us over a mile away from our car, standing next to a busy road in a town we’re very unfamiliar with (we drove in from a town about 30 minutes away to try it out). We were expecting the route to loop back, and when it didn’t we were sorely disappointed. Would have been a nice heads up to know the route didn’t loop. Ended taking a Lyft back.\n\nAll this to say, I think I’d give the app one more try, as it was pretty fun for the first half. I won’t be recommending to friends yet, and if the second time isn’t great I probably won’t do it again, but it’s worth a shot because it’s a good concept.",

In addition to lots of laughter and wonderful photos, the challenges throughout the hunt helped facilitate meaningful conversations that helped us really get to know each other...and made me realize that I have finally found the one!\n\nLet’s Roam really exceeded my expectations in all aspects, and I can’t wait to explore more of world with my honey using this app! :) I hope you all get a chance to try it as well!

My friend was very game for one of the “hard” challenges. \n\nThere are lightning rounds, photo challenges, and depending on the character role you choose, you may or may not like your personal challenges. There’s also a bonus map challenge you can do along with the main hunt. You don’t need to finish everything, just the main hunt.\n\nSo think of this as 3 challenges during one hunt. I got to catchup with my friend, and we learned some new things. She was the ‘explorer’ and got very literal challenges, while I decided to be the ‘youngster’ and got very vague challenges.\n\nWhat I really hope gets improved on is the glitchiness. App definitely froze at the end, leaving a blank page. We really wanted to know our scores. It’s finally visible now after 24 hours. Also don’t see any option to share the hunt or photos, despite the share button, it doesn’t work. Possibility that it only works during the hunt and not after?\n\nWould love to share everything with my friend; since I saw there’s a code to share hunt w/friends, but I didn’t see the app code pop up when I redeemed our tickets. Maybe I missed something when I skimmed the video, but there also aren’t that many options on the app, so hard to miss.\n\nDefinitely 5 stars when this doesn’t give me a blank page and I can share pics.",

Worse, it requires a Facebook or google ID to sign in (which my children don’t have) This was not disclosed until after the download! There was very few interesting factoids, much less actual history which could have been easily incorporated. The app itself wasn’t intuitive, so there was added confusion of what to do & why different players had different screens (I think of one player read a question and tapped an answer, other players would miss the question altogether and might be directed to the next location without realizing it - no way to go back and see the sequence or questions). There was a lot of walking to very random things. (Which is fine for a scavenger hunt) but there could be been more things in between. \n\nwe never understood the ‘roles’ I think each might get different sub questions? \n\nDon’t bother - much too expensive for what it is.

I hate this app with every fiber of my being.  The whole process of buying tickets and the trying to enter them into the app left much to desire.   Every time you switch to another app, it restarts.  You enter the code to start the hunt, then have no way to actually start the hunt.  When you try to join a game, it says you’ve already used the code.  There are no instructions of how to play.  It just shows you a picture and you have to figure out that you have to find where it is, and stand near where the photo was taken.  But not every question.   Video uploads take 3-5 minutes of standing around, doing nothing. Nobody can do anything until it finishes.  The upload crashed several times and had to be redone.  There were questions like finding which star wasn’t represented on the sidewalk. There are hundreds of stars, all over the area.   It’s just gets worse from there.     Ugh!!!!!!",

My husband got this for my birthday. While at dinner we all opened the app and tried to join. There is so much other junk on the app not related to the event that it is difficult to figure out where to go for what you need. Not user friendly at all. We finally join but then all of us had issues. My app crashed every time I clicked the event button. Another friend couldn’t join at all. My husband finally got the first bar so we walked over and got a drink. We decided to just do the challenges he was seeing since no one else could join, but the camera feature was horrible. It was grainy and super zoomed in when taking a selfie.  It rejected every picture we tried to take as “not what they are looking for”. We finally called the help line. Spent 20 minutes of our time on the call with zero resolution except that she emailed my husband the list of bars and we completed the tour with no challenges (Which was kind of the point. We could have bar hopped on our own.) \nAs for the bars, ours were all really close to each other, which was nice. One of them was shut down. They were all kind of the same style of bar, small, pub style. It would have been nice to have some variety. We walked right past a couple of bars that was super eclectic and fun and would have been neat to have on the list. \nAs a whole, a complete waste of money though. Fun idea, very poorly executed.",

We had 6 people in the team and everyone had loading issues, couldn’t upload photos or videos, and sometimes the app would just crash. \nThe layout of the hunt was poorly done and felt like someone making it didn’t actually play it through, what was supposed to be 1 hour and 3 miles was 6 miles and 2 hours before we gave up. There was no guidance on where to go next and the locations were grouped in such a way that it didn’t make an actual circle. Just plot points on a map. If there was at least a numbering system or a recommended path that would helped significantly. \nThe most frustrating part was every time we opened the map it went to Nigeria and we had to scroll and zoom until we got to Detroit. You couldn’t just pop up the map to find the next location without zooming and scrolling every time. \nLastly there were some things that just no longer existed. The hunt was for murals but in Detroit they can be painted over at any time especially if someone buys the building, so we had to give up on a couple because they just didn’t exist, making us have to no complete the game. \nOverall I would say the app is okay but not great, the game is poorly planned and executed for Detroit, and it’s much too expensive for the overall experience.",

When I went back on the app to continue my hunt, I had no direction on what to do next so when I hit continue it gave me some points and kicked me out.  Customer service  told me to take the app off my phone and download it again.  At this point at over an hour of trying to figure it out my family (14yr, 12yr, 4yr and husband) were just done.  Customer service said there wasn’t anything wrong with the app and that they couldn’t help me.  No refund. NOTHING!  DONT GET THIS APP might as well just throw your money in the trash!",

We had a small group consisting of my household and my sisters, which left us with a bunch of children.  \n\nWe wanted to try the hunt on the capitol grounds for the history lesson, but the grounds are barricaded and fenced off.  We found another hunt just a few blocks away and paid for parking and used the token.\n\nThe very first clue held lots of graffiti from last summers riots over George Floyd.  Being greeted with ACAB graffiti with the anarchist symbol emblazoned was not well received due to one of the members present being a cop.  He most assuredly isn’t a bastard.  On our way to the next clue, he informed us we were passing an open air drug market, which held a strong odor of marijuana, and several rough looking gentlemen whom color coordinated their wardrobe.  2 of the members of that group followed us for a block before turning back.  \n\nWe discontinued the hunt after that.\n\nAs an activity that markets itself as being family friendly, this really wasn’t something I wanted to bring four kids under the age of 6 to.

      "# Puzzles are too easy, 1 stars [(Papa18481, Apple App Store, 2020-12-02)](https://apple/6709539427)\nWe tried hard to love this experience but it was not what we are looking for.  \nFirst off getting the team registered was painful, it worked easily on some phones and not at all with others.  We ended up not getting everyone registered and just starting.\n\nFor each location there are several puzzles, but they are SO easy, the answers are all in the question.  For example, one question was about a year. Something like “in the 1870’s some event happened, add the digits of the building address to get the last digit in the year”.  You have to enter the entire year, but the interface gives you only four numbers to choose from, and you know the first three are 1-8-7, so the remaining one is the last digit. You don’t even have to look for the building address.  The only challenge is when it asks you to go to the next location, but it just gives you a building name and distance, so you either know the area or you don’t, no logic or puzzle to it.   This had the potential to be SO fun.  We bailed part way through.  Some of the challenges are to take a photo of your team here, which are clearly meant to elicit social media posts for the app.  Good thing for them I am only posting my experience here and not all over my social media.",

My son adores scavenger hunts which is one reason he has found Pokémon Go so enthralling. As it turned out only 2 of us could play on the planned day, but my son and I usually Pokémon together so it was all good. We were both eager to begin the hunt.\n\nWe had difficulties connecting him to the game. We called for technical support and received an actual human after very little wait who was able to solve our problem. I had to restart my phone and we signed in all over again, but it worked. Unfortunately, 2 stops into the game, our batteries had drained from 80% to less than 20% in a short time. I provide internet connection for my son allowing him to connect via hotspot. It adds to the power drain but we have always been able to hunt Pokémon this way with few issues. We paused the game (were thankful for the option provided) and stopped for lunch to recharge.\n\nWhen we tried to resume play, we again experienced technical difficulties. My son was excited to be assigned a special role, he chose photographer and was enjoying taking pictures, but he was unable to reconnect and resume. We again called for tech support, again our problems were resolved quickly, but once again we had to restart the hunt from the beginning. This was frustrating and it wasn’t the last of our technical problems.\n\nWe needed a map. While there is one provided in the game, we were unable to zoom in to identify street names. The street name, the distance and a photo were our only clues to locate the next stop. Better maps were available but only through an in-app purchase of coins. I used my Apple Map.\n\nWe enjoyed the prompts for pictures, but again had to leave the game app to access our own camera. We were also encouraged to share on social media which required opening another app. Game play slowed significantly and our batteries drained more quickly.\n\nMy son enjoyed the mini-games and secondary hunts. He completed 3 or 4 and would have done more, however since these also required the use of our cameras, and our batteries were dying fast, he abandoned these fun tasks.\n\nWe stopped one more time to charge our phones. We didn’t mind stopping, we had intended to explore the city and make a day of it. However when we tried to resume and once again my son had trouble reconnecting, our enthusiasm cooled. We continued using only my phone but our interest waned. We abandoned the hunt before it was completed. \n\nI doubt we’ll redeem our other 2 tickets. That’s an expensive loss. It would be fun if it wasn’t so draining.",
      "# My favorite app ever made!!, 5 stars [(Adyline D, Apple App Store, 2019-10-29)](https://apple/5048014463)\nIf I could give this a 20 star rating I would. My boyfriend purchased tickets to do a scavenger hunt with Let’s Roam a few months ago. It was probably one of the most fun nights I’ve ever had. I’ve been in Denver for a few years now but never really experienced the city like we did that night. We were able to hit so many cool spots that I didn’t even know existed! I learned so much and had a blast roaming around with my favorite person. I’d definitely 100% recommend Let’s Roam for a fun date night! Especially if you’re looking for something exciting to do for a first date! We try to find any excuse to go on a scavenger hunt these days. When we travel to a new city, it’s so easy to purchase Let’s Roam tickets and start exploring! You can do it anytime and in so many cities across the globe. The app is seamless and if we have any questions the customer service representatives are so nice and helpful! I have only had to call once and they immediately answered my questions.\n \nIt is such a fun activity no matter what the occasion is. They offer scavenger hunts for date nights, bachelorette parties, team building, and birthdays too! My sister is getting married in a few months and we used Let’s Roam for her bachelorette party. She had a BLAST and now her friends want to do the same thing for their bachelorette parties coming up! Not only does it guide you through the city but it also prompts you and your friends with activities and challenges along the way. It’s a perfect set up for an amazing time.\n \nRecently, Let’s Roam launched a dining membership feature too! I LOVE trying new restaurants around the city but it definitely used to put a big hole in my wallet. There are so many amazing restaurants I wanted to hit but would often settle with ramen or a frozen pizza to save some money. With the Let’s Roam Dining Membership, I’ve been able to try 20 new restaurants in the past couple of months! They offer so many different options and have over 50 partnerships with the hottest restaurants in town. I’m definitely giving Let’s Roam Dining Memberships for Christmas gifts this year!",

I actually kept thinking they just typoed the word “loss” for “lost” until it popped up again (twice) in the survey:  “at any point were you loss because of directions? “ Are you kidding me? \n\n5.  It made us walk to Pat O’s to start just to send us all the way to the Cathedral.  Just start us at the Cathedral. \n\n6.  It “ended” at Pat O’s and said “your search is now over have a celebratory drink, congrats you have finished” or some such nonsense so we did and then it had three more stops after that including a headstand!  Don’t make us stop and drink if you want us to do a headstand.  It also affected our time because we wasted it because we thought we were done. \n\n7. Questions said they were worth 20 points and when we finished them they were worth 50.\n\n8.  More than one question had multiple right answers but would only allow us to select one, making us get the answer wrong.  The Thriller question was just plain wrong and I have no idea what that has to do with a New Orleans scavenger hunt \n\n9. It took us over a working railroad track and we had to stop and wait for a train.  It also would send us to grassy residential areas and then ask us to take  pictures of a skyscraper and then send us to the CBD and business district and then ask us to headstand on grass. \n\nWhoever wrote this has no knowledge of New Orleans, how to make a good scanner hunt, or how to write. The app was easy to use and the idea novel but that’s all I can give it credit for. I’m a pro writer and would be happy to rewrite this scavenger hunt for you guys (sorry, Shannan, your birthday is over!)",

While it was a great concept, and we had a fun time, this app appears to be very poorly made. 1. The toast makers got no independent challenges 2. It freezes and crashes any time I hit dashboard 3. The game never ended... we still do not know who won 4. There is no one ‘checking’ the answers. 5. Two of the group challenges were extremely similar (asking for a photo of a bird or flying insect then asking for a photo of a black bird) 6. I learned nothing about the city in which we scavenged. \n\nIt really was a waste of 20. I could have put this together for free. I do not recommend at all.",

For what we paid for, it ran horribly and was unclear and confusing. The app has access to the GPS, so I’m not sure why it wouldn’t notify us when we got to each landmark. Not only that, but once we got to the landmark, it was unclear what was a question for the team and what was a challenge for the individual. As a result, we missed half the questions because we didn’t know if it was a challenge or part of the game.

      "# Fun game, but weak ending., 2 stars [(Billybobjon, Apple App Store, 2018-12-21)](https://apple/3556833465)\nDid the Plano, TX scavenger hunt, and was really enjoying it for a good amount of time. It was fun, informative, and a great activity to do with the family.\n\nHowever, about halfway through the hunt, the scavenger locations started to get further and further apart, and weren’t nearly as interesting as the locations in the first half (like, the final destination asked a question about the color of the slides at a park, as opposed to earlier questions being about historical landmarks). \n\nThe real kicker was the scavenger hunt ended a mile and a half from the starting point (where our car is located). So, instead of looping us back to the start point, the hunt left us over a mile away from our car, standing next to a busy road in a town we’re very unfamiliar with (we drove in from a town about 30 minutes away to try it out). We were expecting the route to loop back, and when it didn’t we were sorely disappointed. Would have been a nice heads up to know the route didn’t loop. Ended taking a Lyft back.\n\nAll this to say, I think I’d give the app one more try, as it was pretty fun for the first half. I won’t be recommending to friends yet, and if the second time isn’t great I probably won’t do it again, but it’s worth a shot because it’s a good concept.",

      "# Let’s Roam helped me find the one! ❤️, 5 stars [(jfowbf, Apple App Store, 2018-11-07)](https://apple/3391625682)\nForget the unproductive dating apps. Forget the apathetic movie dates. Forget the boring dinner dates. I think you get my point...Let’s Roam is the best way to meet your true love!!!\n\nMy date Michel suggested Let’s Roam for our first date, and I had no idea what would possibly happen during a scavenger hunt. I expected that we would have a typical treasure map where we found random things...in attempts to keep ourselves busy and avoid the awkwardness of a first date. \n\nBUT I was SO wrong! \n\nMichel and I learned so much about the city I had lived in for years (when I thought I had known it all) and laughed the entire time from reading the quirky messages after solving each mission. Also, the romantic photo challenges allowed us to be closer and re-enact cute scenarios, and I now have several adorable photos of us that I will cherish forever! In addition to lots of laughter and wonderful photos, the challenges throughout the hunt helped facilitate meaningful conversations that helped us really get to know each other...and made me realize that I have finally found the one!\n\nLet’s Roam really exceeded my expectations in all aspects, and I can’t wait to explore more of world with my honey using this app! :) I hope you all get a chance to try it as well! Maybe you’ll find a new love, strengthen the relationships you already have made, or more!",
      "# Annoying yet Fun, 3 stars [(@kicktheball, Apple App Store, 2018-11-02)](https://apple/3373670464)\nDid this as a team work outing. It’s a great way to see how people do or so not work together. If you are a rule follower and/or like to win you will probably blow a gasket, because guess what, not everyone on your team cares about rules and winning! Customer support was awesome to us as we dealt with log in issues but we all had fun and their were no serious fights, lol. Hint: follow directions, even though they are vague. 3 stars because every minute I get a prompt to review the app. So I’m reviewing the app already!

It took us through parts of DC that we don’t normally visit and the areas were not crowded with tourists. We learned lots of fun facts about history and architecture too. Only issue was not getting our score until 2 days after we finished and even then, we didn’t get to see stats from other hunts. It would great for you to have a leaderboard for comparison.

      "# Worth a try, 4 stars [(Moodygreyjeans, Apple App Store, 2018-10-01)](https://apple/3250829173)\nIt’s definitely something you want to do with the right people. My friend was very game for one of the “hard” challenges. \n\nThere are lightning rounds, photo challenges, and depending on the character role you choose, you may or may not like your personal challenges. There’s also a bonus map challenge you can do along with the main hunt. You don’t need to finish everything, just the main hunt.\n\nSo think of this as 3 challenges during one hunt. I got to catchup with my friend, and we learned some new things. She was the ‘explorer’ and got very literal challenges, while I decided to be the ‘youngster’ and got very vague challenges.\n\nWhat I really hope gets improved on is the glitchiness. App definitely froze at the end, leaving a blank page. We really wanted to know our scores. It’s finally visible now after 24 hours. Also don’t see any option to share the hunt or photos, despite the share button, it doesn’t work. Possibility that it only works during the hunt and not after?\n\nWould love to share everything with my friend; since I saw there’s a code to share hunt w/friends, but I didn’t see the app code pop up when I redeemed our tickets. Maybe I missed something when I skimmed the video, but there also aren’t that many options on the app, so hard to miss.\n\nDefinitely 5 stars when this doesn’t give me a blank page and I can share pics.",

Poorly executed., 1 stars [(Wonderland55a, Apple App Store, 2018-09-24)](https://apple/3224306816)\nI thought this would entertain a few 5th & 6th graders and their parents, but it was very dull. Worse, it requires a Facebook or google ID to sign in (which my children don’t have) This was not disclosed until after the download! There was very few interesting factoids, much less actual history which could have been easily incorporated. The app itself wasn’t intuitive, so there was added confusion of what to do & why different players had different screens (I think of one player read a question and tapped an answer, other players would miss the question altogether and might be directed to the next location without realizing it - no way to go back and see the sequence or questions). There was a lot of walking to very random things. (Which is fine for a scavenger hunt) but there could be been more things in between. \n\nwe never understood the ‘roles’ I think each might get different sub questions? \n\nDon’t bother - much too expensive for what it is. Great idea, poorly written. lazy execution.",

I haven't found anything quite as good as RDR2 for immersive free roaming.

I loved this despite it being a setting I traditionally don't enjoy.\n\nFar Cry 5: first person shooter with an interesting world to explore. It has many flaws, imo, but can be fun to wander about. The fishing is, imo, better than RDR2.\n\nGhost Recon Wildlands: suggesting this over the newer Breakpoint as it has a better world with the possibility of creating more intense situations.\n\nWatch Dogs 2: all three games are on ps4 but 2 in my opinion has the best map for exploration and the most potential to create interesting situations.\n\n## Comment ID h6s73ef with +12 score by [(DarkIxis, Reddit, 2021-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/h6s73ef/) (in reply to ID oszpl5):\nDays Gone is the sandbox I'm trudging through, good mechanics, decent story, and lots of exploring.

It’s gotten a lot of hate. It’s just as fun as the first two. It’s a super cop game where you can jump real high, blow shit up, throw cars and objects and people around, wing suit every where, drive suped up cars and do crazy jumps and all that shit. \n\nThe great thing is, if you don’t want to play the game for him and beat it, there’s a mode called “Keys To The City” or something along those lines. \n\nBasically it’s a mode where you can spawn in any object from the game, like deck him out with all weapons; you can max level the character instantly so he has the highest jumps and is the strongest. Spawn any vehicle, enemies, bosses (I think bosses not sure). Basically just a big ass chest playground. Enable god mode, enable a jet pack, bunch of more of the wacky weapons. Super super flexible and when you start it everything from the main game is completable here. You can go through the whole game with god mode enabled, best weapons, find all the power ups, and all that. \n\nIt’s gunplay is lock on based so he doesn’t need to be super accurate. \n\nI would say if he likes open world, this is the game to choose. Let’s him go through the story basically in easy mode if he wants, and just go around knocking off objectives or fucking around too.\n\n## Comment ID jvckape with +1 score by [(VQ_Sal, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvckape/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nRed Dead redemption 2, if he wants to be a cowboy\n\n## Comment ID jvckczl with +1 score by [(lordnyrox, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvckczl/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nRDR2\n\n## Comment ID jvckkd1 with +1 score by [(SpicyNoodlez1, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvckkd1/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nThere's alot of better games then gta that's like it, cyberpunk, red dead 2\n\n## Comment ID jvcklfk with +1 score by [(TheLewisIs_REAL, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvcklfk/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nNever played cyberpunk but from clips it gives me GTA vibes so maybee that\n\n## Comment ID jvcoofk with +1 score by [(Pvzlife, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvcoofk/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nMaybe something like fallout or Skyrim?\n\n## Comment ID jvcpegt with +1 score by [(UltraToaster, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvcpegt/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nA little older now but Prototype 1 and 2 are both games that you can just roam for hours being an unbeatable god doing whatever you want, especially if you've finished the campaign and want to let him roam around.\n\n## Comment ID jvcu8bn with +1 score by [(NomadSoul22, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvcu8bn/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nKatamari is not like those games but i think that could work\n\n## Comment ID jvcxpk3 with +1 score by [(Kell-ah, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvcxpk3/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nJust Die Already is a good one\n\n## Comment ID jvd0ps8 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvd0ps8/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nPressure washer simulator\n\n## Comment ID jvd2ji8 with +1 score by [(PoshEwok, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvd2ji8/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nWatch dogs 2?

At any time you could hand over the controller to him so he can fly the plane.\n\nThe other suggestion:\n\nThe **Forza Horizon** series:\n\nThe difficulty can be greatly reduced by automating various parts of the driving (automatic gears, ABS brakes, computer controlled per wheel lock, full drive paths, etc. etc.) and lowering the difficulty of computer controlled opponents. I’m (un-)sure there are ways to reduce the difficulty of steering, turning left and right, braking, following the drive path, etc.\n\nCars can be painted in custom colors and fitted with *really* cool looking custom liveries. Among many, many other features.\n\n## Comment ID jvdsgn2 with +1 score by [(Splatulated, Reddit, 2023-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvdsgn2/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\ntheres soem really old title for xbo original called mercenaries playground of destruction\n\n## Comment ID jvdt4uk with +1 score by [(Liquidety, Reddit, 2023-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvdt4uk/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nWatch Dogs can be good just for fucking around on, but the hacks rely on reading so, like, idk. Legion however has some brilliant accessibility features, so it's definitely worth a look. WD1 has less of a fuck aroundability compared to 2 or Legion, but it's good none the less\n\nI also find modded fallout 4 with a few mods to remove maybe the main quests or give you an alternate start a really good screw around game. Obviously it's an FPS but there is a third person mode. Throw a few fucky mods in there and you could make a really fun game just for running around, killing people and looting their bodies, and exploring. Skyrim is the same story really, but the fantasy aspect makes it more reliant on books and text rather than fallout 4 holotapes for a lot of the environmental narrative.\n\nActually, Fallout 76 might be really good. The game has a really accepting, kind community, a completely ignorable main questline and the entire structure is basically jump from event to event to kill things and keep yourself occupied. It's pretty hard resource wise at the start though so that's worth considering.\n\nIdk much about Red Faction because the last time I played it I was like 6, but Red Faction Guerilla is open world and basically just about destroying stuff, with a hammer, because most of the world is destroyable. Might be a good idea, same with the Just Cause franchise. \n\nI'd never normally recommend the Saints Row spinoff Agents Of Mayhem but it's a good third person fuck around game too. \n\nIn a similar vain, Sunset Overdrive. Although, it does somewhat punish you for just fucking around as you will run out of ammo and get swarmed by thousands, and the movement can be really a little complex at times, but it's fun, flashy and has a banging soundtrack. Doesn't take itself seriously at all and it worth a look on YouTube maybe. \n\nYou know what else might be good if you push through the prologue a bit, or even get to the final phase of the game? Red Dead 2, or Red Dead Online. Its really not the worst for just running around and blasting people.\n\n## Comment ID jvdtsb9 with +1 score by [(tirednotepad, Reddit, 2023-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvdtsb9/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nRead dead redemption 1 & 2, fallout, Witcher, mafia 1,2, & 3, Zelda on switch, Jedi fallen order (you can replay the levels and enemies repopulate after you rest), assasins creed, mass effect.

It’s basically a long spread out movie with incredible story telling that comes largely from cut scenes. I will say, ignore the people who just call it a walking simulator because the “walking” is quite engaging and gets more so the farther you get BUT it is still walking and just observing the landscape and your character Sam. Seeing as you struggled with RDR2 I think you’ll find the high intensity action (meaning shooting and combat) even less prevalent as there is also an emphasis on stealth.\n\n#### Comment ID la1o0dq with +1 score by [(allofdarknessin1, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la1o0dq/) (in reply to ID l9z82t5):\nI wasn't a Kojima fan growing up but I think Death Stranding is a master piece.

Gta driving is mostly physics based and very different than watch dogs.

Love it, but I can not stick to the main storyline lol. Always get wrapped up in side quests or hunting or challenges and always get burnt out - sometimes never even making it past Horseshoe Overlook.\n\nCould try Mad Max. Action gets intense, extremely satisfying hand to hand and vehicular combat. A barren and desolate open world wasteland, but teeming with life still. Only thing is that it's linear. So once you complete quests and events they're pretty much done for good. But still a great experience. Cinematics and story content can be quite appealing too.\n\nFor something simple and a little different, Lego Lord of the Rings. As a big fan of the movies and JRR Tolkien's works in general, I really enjoyed it, from beginning to end! Open world with lots to do in terms of collectivles and interactions, but also level based at it's core. I kept thinking I had finished the game and it just kept surprising me with more content lol. Also couch co-op.\n\nBatman: Arkham City did that too. Very nice amount of content concerning the main campaign and side missions. Lots of cool dialogue as you explore the city that makes it feel more immersive. Just a great game all around imo. Played it 2 or 3 times now. Or Arkham City since it includes the batmobile - which just so happens to have handling just as odd as the vehicle mechanics in Mad Max. But it can be a lot of fun and just as immersive as City imo.\n\nFEZ. Has an interesting way of navigating through the world, similar to Kirby and the Amazing Mirror in it's own right. I thinknof it as a little dopamine generator as the main task is collecting and you get a fun prompt every time you acquire one of the many collectibles placed generously around the game world. Be warned though, the game is finishable without a guide. But if you go for completion, a walkthrough is required. Another one I've returned to several times over the years.\n\nJust Cause 2 or 3? Or Saints Row IV? Vehicle mechanics aren't as finely tuned as they are in GTAV, but great game worlds to explore and follow the main objectives in. Your choice of a tropical paradise or a visually intriguing glitchy neon alien hellscape?\n\n### Comment ID la372jp with +2 score by [(tonguemyanus69420, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la372jp/) (in reply to ID l9yavzh):\nIm the same with Red Dead. 150 hours and only completed 50% of the main story.\n\nIncredible game and world.\n\n### Comment ID la0b4h8 with +1 score by [(Jhoosier, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la0b4h8/) (in reply to ID l9yavzh):\nSaint's Row, can't remember if it's 3 or 4, but it was ridiculously stupid fun driving around and causing mayhem.

It’s an MMORPG like WoW, but (in my opinion) the story is A THOUSAND times better; it’s actually plotted out, so each expansion is a continuation of the overarching story, not just a whole new D&D-style campaign.\n\nPlus the NPCs do eventually have very tongue-in-cheek remarks about “we know you’ve saved the world several times now, but can you spare a few minutes to help with this menial task?” The game doesn’t take itself too seriously (unlike WoW, which I found to be very much all-in on the fantasy RPG and pushing the “you’re the champion of the whole universe” kind of thing) and the developers have been reworking the game so that you can run dungeons (called Duties) with a party of NPCs instead of other players, if solo play is a little more your thing. It’s also useful if you’re trying to level a DPS class, since the queue times can be *painful*…\n\nThere’s a trial version that’s free to play up to Stormblood (the second expansion)/level 70, and if you decide you like it, you can by the complete game for like $60 and it comes with ALL the current content.\n\nTheres a new expansion dropping next week (early access actually opens this Friday) and with it will come a huge graphics update, too. Now would be a great time to give the game a shot!\n\nI also feel it’s a little more casual player friendly than WoW, since you don’t get penalized for not logging in every day (WoW has dailies that can start to feel like you HAVE to do them) and all of the raid content is 100% optional. They don’t lock any major story stuff behind raids, so if you aren’t the type of player to do them, you’ll never miss out on the full main storyline, (unlike WoW lol) but there’s a lot of fun additional lore to benefit from if you DO like doing raids!\n\nETA: It’s also player friendly in that you can learn any and every class on one character, so you’re *never* locked in! If you start with, say, and Archer or a Thaumaturge but decide that you don’t like them/their advanced jobs of Bard and Black Mage, you can just pick up a new class on that same character. It was one of the biggest draws for me when I jumped ship from WoW to FFXIV, and I didn’t even realize how much I hated being locked into one class until I had the option NOT to be lol.\n\nOne of my favorite things to do is to log in and just wander the world. I once put my headphones on, turned my UI off, and made the on-foot trek from Gridania (one of the starting cities) in the Twelveswood to Ul’dah (another starting city) in Thanalan—then turned around and went back the same way. I turned my BGM down so it was quite soft, but had my ambient effects turned up, so I could hear things like the wind in the trees and birds chirping, and by setting myself just to *walk,* with the UI off (and toggling in and out of 1st person POV) I was able to really drink in all the scenery. Which was a really nice change of pace from being knee-deep in the storyline. :) It was one of the most relaxing experiences I’ve ever had, and I highly recommend people give it a try!\n\nYou can get it on PS4/5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Mac, and Steam. If you know anyone who plays, get them to invite you via friend code, so you both get bonuses if you end up buying the game and subscribing for a few months!\n\n#### Comment ID la0bk92 with +1 score by [(Jhoosier, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la0bk92/) (in reply to ID l9z8tpe):\nIf you're considering WoW, I'd throw in a recommendation for Guild Wars 2. The world is massive, there's tons of little one-off stories and things hidden around in addition to the main story. There's also a number of different game styles involved. You can explore and find new/hidden places, the mounts are impressive in their handling. Each one feels distinct and has its own uses.

Ignore literally everything else and just be an oitlaw cowboy doing whatever you want. \n\n Valhalla, I wouldn't consider a game to just wander around in. You can, but i feel its more about the story and seeking gear and mysteries. I disagree with people complaining about Valhalla being too long. It better paces the story than Odyssey does. For me, it perfectly balances the open world RPG style of the recent games with the more focused stories of the older ones, along with having the mystery glitches and rewarding item collection to unlock a piece of gear. \n\nI'm currently playing Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and having a lot of fun. Once you get access to your ikran, it opens up the map and you can easily just explore. It does follow the Far Cry style open world with tons of points of interest to visit and crafting ingredients to collect, but it feels much more organic and engaging.\n\n## Comment ID la3jc8n with +1 score by [(VBTrix, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la3jc8n/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nSea of thieves\n\n## Comment ID la3jloy with +1 score by [(MinuteScientist7254, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la3jloy/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nStarfield\n\n## Comment ID la3x7pv with +1 score by [(kplocdog, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la3x7pv/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nLotro\n\nType it in to Google\n\nWalk around \n\nBe the shire.\n\n## Comment ID la3xoay with +1 score by [(BigOlympic, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la3xoay/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nThe Division\n\n## Comment ID la41zlp with +1 score by [(illmatic2112, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la41zlp/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nIt's not super deep but during AC2 when i was done and just going around hunting down flags while listening to my music, it was a nice relaxing feeling.

Minecraft has a pokemon mod (cobblemon, not the other one) that I spent some time on recently as well and it was cool to put a fresh spin on a game that old.\nAre you open to older games? Do you have a preference on the genre or type of game?\n\nThe Forest and its sequel both have a cool quality of discovery about them, open worlds, crafting, some body horror, and pretty worlds if you enjoy woodsy terrain.\nSkyrim is an obvious choice, especially if you haven't played it with mods.\nIf you haven't played them or if it's been a long time I'd highly recommend going back to any of the Final Fantasty games between like 6-10, Tactics, or other older classics like Chrono Trigger or Legend of Dragoon. You really can't beat the worldbuilding and storytelling of some of those.\n\nIf you're looking for a more bite sized experience that's easier to pick up and put down, maybe try something like Hades, Risk of Rain 2, or Megaloot. I really enjoy games like these as palette cleansers between bigger, more time consuming or mentally engaging games, like appetizers, to shut off the brain and get lost in the \"one more run\" loop, and typically once I'm ready to put it down there's a bigger game calling my name and I'm more mentally ready to engage with it for the long haul too.\n\n## Comment ID lagn5p2 with +1 score by [(ziasaur, Reddit, 2024-06-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/lagn5p2/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nI liked Zelda: breath of the wild because you could sneak up on monster packs and they’d be kinda vibing and goofing off until they noticed you :D\n\n## Comment ID lagvmf6 with +1 score by [(ToastyPillowsack, Reddit, 2024-06-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/lagvmf6/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nThe Assassin's Creed games revolving around Ezio (2, Brotherhood, and Revelations) are pretty great imo.

You appreciate the wildlife, the trees, the weather, the landscape and the music a lot more when you're not blazing past it at 100mph. \n\nBut that's the downside: most game companies are about providing intense action at all times. Very few games want to give the player a slow moment because those are moments that a player is likely to stop playing in. Even comparing RDR1 to RDR2 illustrates this as RDR1, fantastic as it is, plays more like a _video game_ than a _simulation_, which is the core difference in my eyes\n\n### Comment ID gsbh2i9 with +9 score by [(LexB777, Reddit, 2021-03-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbh2i9/) (in reply to ID gsb7qjk):\nReally interesting point. I had considered the slow pacing, but not the fact that you actually move and do things slower.\n\nWhen I first started the game, I found the pacing made me antsy. I kept wanting to go faster, but I *knew* that I would fall in love with this game. I played the ever living shit out of RDR1, over and over again. Same with GTA5 and Skyrim. I'm the kind of player that buys about 1 or 2 games per year.\n\nNow that I'm in the last Chapter of the whole game, I wish I had taken it even slower (even though I have 180 hours logged into the first save, not sure if that's normal but it feels like a lot). I definitely will go even slower on my second play through.\n\n#### Comment ID gsbhj5p with +5 score by [(Joss_Card, Reddit, 2021-03-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbhj5p/) (in reply to ID gsbh2i9):\nThat's what I did.

Actually this experience would be a lot better at night but you have to worry about the cops. But Palm City is an awesome map with a Miami aesthetic and it carries the atmosphere hard. The driving is also decent and the roads are really good.\n\nIf you like piss filters, Most wanted 05 is actually not a bad game for free roam, Rockport is a surprising great map with varied locations, great roads and a great driving model, but not at slow speeds relative to your car. If you want to just fly through through the city to keep adrenaline going, Most Wanted for you. \n\nI think the best free roam game might be Carbon. Palmont is not that big, especially compared to the later games. But goddamn is the free roam experience so good. The atmosphere is amazing, great roads and the city is pretty good, it has really cool locations that great to cruise and explore in. Only problem is that it may feel kinda small. Plus it's got a banging soundtrack and the driving is also great, albeit sense of speed's not as good as MW 05 but still good. And sometimes there are cars that would just pull up on you and want to race you. You do have to be wary of cops though, but you can avoid, and you pay to lower your heat later at the safe house. And if you do get into a chase, it will be a good one imo.\n\n## Comment ID kre54pz with +1 score by [(Saiibox, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/1avkd0v/best_nfs_game_to_free_roam/kre54pz/) (in reply to ID 1avkd0v):\n2012 easy no contest\n\n## Comment ID krfddry with +1 score by [(JS-CroftLover, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/1avkd0v/best_nfs_game_to_free_roam/krfddry/) (in reply to ID 1avkd0v):\nNeed For Speed Most Wanted 2005\n\n### Comment ID krvw9e0 with +2 score by [(dark_fesse, Reddit, 2024-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/1avkd0v/best_nfs_game_to_free_roam/krvw9e0/) (in reply to ID krfddry):\nmain issue with mw05 free roaming is that a single accident (hitting anything on the map) will pretty often result with the cops being called and coming to find you\n\n#### Comment ID kryjsfs with +2 score by [(JS-CroftLover, Reddit, 2024-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/1avkd0v/best_nfs_game_to_free_roam/kryjsfs/) (in reply to ID krvw9e0):\nThat's why I always drove the cars responsibly, around Rockport 😃\n\n## Comment ID krjo5dv with +1 score by [(xkhloerodimusx, Reddit, 2024-02-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/1avkd0v/best_nfs_game_to_free_roam/krjo5dv/) (in reply to ID 1avkd0v):\nMw2012\n\n## Comment ID ksmdh1u with +1 score by [(codycbradio, Reddit, 2024-02-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/1avkd0v/best_nfs_game_to_free_roam/ksmdh1u/) (in reply to ID 1avkd0v):\nUnderground 2 for the free roam without cops.

      "# Post ID 1amz7sx: Recommendations for games like Genshin. (Single player; free roam; exploration with puzzles) with +5 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/)\nHi,\n\nDo you have any recommendations for games like Genshin Impact. I mean: single player mainly; free roaming open-world and exploration with puzzles.\n\nFrom what I know:\n\n\"Zelda Breath of the Wild\" and \"Tears of Kingdom\"\n\nImmortal Fenyx Rising\n\nWuthering Waves (not yet released but I still count it)\n\n* What I do **NOT** look for:\n\nGames mainly focused on multiplayer (example: Tower of Fantasy) (I have a bad connection, so my ping is quite bad. It's still okay when Internet is only a bit required like Genshin, but once other players are involved, I often have a lag of a few seconds)\n\nNon free-roaming games (example: Honkai Star Rail) (The puzzles often make me feel like I found a rubik's cube on the side of the road instead of the puzzle being hidden and part of the world. What I am looking for is to explore, find secrets and be rewarded for solving them; all that in a fluid way, instead of the puzzle interrupting my freedom of movement).\n\n* What make no difference for me:\n\nCombat: Combats can be action or turned based\n\nClimbing: There can be no climbing. It can even be no jumping. As long as the environment allow falling from edges to find secret (think Dark Souls. No real jumping, but you can find a lot of secrets anyway\n\nDoes anyone know of games like that?\n\nEdit: For more precision: What I am looking for is environmental puzzle; puzzle where you still control your character to solve the puzzle. Not puzzle that feels more like a minigame totally separated from the main gameplay.\n\nAnd the feeling I am looking for is: you explore the world, find a puzzle out in the wild. You try to solve it; if you can't solve it, no problem, you can just return to it later. The other puzzles aren't locked because you didn't complete the previous ones; while at the same time you find puzzles through exploring, it's not a serie of room with puzzle in each of them.\n\n## Comment ID kpphbg1 with +6 score by [(Due-Distribution-463, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpphbg1/) (in reply to ID 1amz7sx):\nFallout 4 and Skyrim are the best open world games although both are graphically out of date. There are no real puzzles in either of them which is a big plus in my book.

Wow, I never thought about it, but *yeah*, the Tallnecks ARE puzzles, where you have to observe the terrain and the machines guarding it, then approach carefully. \n\nMany fights are also puzzles, as (unless you play on the lightest difficulty) it's best to start stealthy and go noisy only when you're not going to get attacked from four different directions. Stealth games are IMHO partly puzzle games where you're trying to solve how to move from point A to point B with a minimum of fuss. \n\nThe sequel has a LOT more puzzles, some of which I remember very fondly; climbing up a pair of overgrown skyscrapers in San Francisco or delving a ruin in the remains of Las Vegas.\n\n#### Comment ID kptrxtg with +1 score by [(Toutanus, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kptrxtg/) (in reply to ID kpphrd1):\nForbiden West has more puzzles\n\n## Comment ID kppgsqd with +4 score by [(Mar_ZP, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kppgsqd/) (in reply to ID 1amz7sx):\nI'm not sure it matches your description but I'll throw it anyways...

Oblivion and Morrowind, too.  Elex is essentially a double-A version of this, if you're really desperate. \n\n\nA bunch of open world jrpgs would match your criteria, too. Try xenoblade, modern final fantasy, etc. \n\n\nDark souls is even heavier on combat and lighter on puzzles than skyrim, but some are free roam. Elden ring is similar, but with much more free roam than dark souls. \n\n\nFallout and starfield could be stretched to meet your criteria. Puzzles are almost non existent tho. \n\n\nAt this point, you're running out of games. Nier and Nier Automata are less free roam than you'd like, and have no focus on puzzles.\n\n### Comment ID kpvoi0q with +3 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpvoi0q/) (in reply to ID kpqiicx):\nI am looking for these puzzles. I am looking for the type of games where you explore, then suddenly, a wild puzzle appears. If you can't solve it, you just return to it later. But the puzzle is environmental, you are still in controls of your characters. A lot of JRPG have the \"rubik's sube\" feeling: you no longer control you character, and instead control the puzzle. It's often because map movement/interaction is limited.\n\nOne of the rare exception for JRPG, is Golden Sun. There are a lot of good puzzle but you are always in control of your character.\n\n## Comment ID kpp5fad with +2 score by [(SnakeTGK, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpp5fad/) (in reply to ID 1amz7sx):\nIsland of insight is gonna release soon (free demo up right now).

Great memories of sword only and that one bow challenge in the inazuma quest where java spent days to get around it. \n\nOfc without an audience you don't have that much of an incentive to not cheat if you're stuck but you can give you hard penalties, e.g. 1 cheat costs a 10pull on the standard banner or something like that. \n\nBut that's just if you're reeeeaaally into a challenge, otherwise it'll likely burn you out\n\n### Comment ID kpvi8lg with +2 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpvi8lg/) (in reply to ID kpr0ifs):\nI am more looking at something casual.

I just want to know what you \"roam\" people know and want to like the roaming role but everytime I try to play roam I get teammates who don't know when to engage and when to retreat then just blame me for being shit like damn, how you guys deal with this BS of the other roles?\n\n## Comment ID koukyz7 with +290 score by [(MattLikesThings, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/koukyz7/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nI like playing Roam because I get to decide who lives and dies.\n\n### Comment ID kouwhj2 with +82 score by [(CantRenameThis, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kouwhj2/) (in reply to ID koukyz7):\nYou also have some power as to who gets bronze by the end of the match.\n\n### Comment ID koulrq5 with +57 score by [(Edgyemo69, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/koulrq5/) (in reply to ID koukyz7):\nAlpha mindset cheers lol.\n\n#### Comment ID kovll9i with +16 score by [(fariq99, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kovll9i/) (in reply to ID koulrq5):\nAlpha is jungle lol not Roam 😹💀😹💀💀💀😹💀💀😹💀💀😹😹💀😹💀💀💀👽🫷🏿🫷🏿👽😸🫷🏿😸🫷🏿👽👽☠️☠️😸🫷🏿🫷🏿😸😸🙀🙌🏼😽🤲👐🏿🫳🏾👐🏿👐🏿👐🏿🤲\n\n\npls let me kill myself\n\n### Comment ID kov9w98 with +13 score by [(jabucniocat, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kov9w98/) (in reply to ID koukyz7):\nJust florin things 💗\n\n#### Comment ID kovhdhu with +18 score by [(dpressdlonelycarrot, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kovhdhu/) (in reply to ID kov9w98):\n+Angela.

I also like not having to stick to just one lane, it's actually crazy how much of a difference a good support can make, and I love to be the one to make that difference I guess. \n\nAs for shitty teammates, in general I just figure out who plays half decent and support them the most if the rest are garbage lol (i make this judgement about halfway into the game. I don't mind if they aren't getting kills because some heroes just don't have that early game damage, what matters to me more is whether or not they're feeding, and if they're attempting to get objectives like tower, turtle, lord, enemy farm, etc. Anything that could help us get the upper hand). You can also use your bad teammates as bait lol. If the other team is used to them going in alone and being dumb, sometimes its helpful to stalk nearby and strike when they try to go for the \"easy\" kill again. if you're a setup tank you can always setup mid fight instead of starting with a set to make sure that your teammates are actually there for your set if they usually suck at following up lol. \n\nI also mute chat if they're being annoying. I know I'm a good tank and support, considering I have good wr being a support main in soloq lol. We all have off games, and I try to keep it real and admit when I'm having an off game and doing my best, but someone cursing at me isn't going to help so to mute jail they go. Also, in classic if someone is mean to me for a long period of time I stop helping them lol. The true power of supporting is taking it away. \n\nSorry for the ramble lmaO I love supports in most games so I also naturally gravitate towards them.\n\n### Comment ID kov2juw with +9 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kov2juw/) (in reply to ID kougagq):\nI don't like sticking to one lane either, but I feel like I don't select my ganks properly as a roam. Being a mid laner is far easier for me. Just stay in the backline and obliterate the enemies. I usually get gold (medal) as a roam so it feels like I'm doing the right thing, but I'm still not confident in my roaming skills.\n\n#### Comment ID koxjcec with +2 score by [(heckincat, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/koxjcec/) (in reply to ID kov2juw):\nThat's totally understandable!! I used to be a mid and gold lane main (nana carried me through so many early games lol, but I also like kagura, vale, and lylia a lot). I personally enjoy support over tank right now, so I understand enjoying back or mid line over being in the front lol. Honestly roaming and mid laning are very similar, only as a roam we usually provide direct buffs or tankiness rather than lane management and damage.  Sometimes roaming is rough though, since you're not doing damage you can't hard carry a team which is awful when no one is doing damage lmaO\n\n### Comment ID kougr23 with +5 score by [(Edgyemo69, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kougr23/) (in reply to ID kougagq):\nThanks for the thorough explanation I am not a support or tank main but whenever I do pick one I tend to stick to the one teammate who's doing well or is being ganked to much and ignore the trashtalker as there always is atleast one lol.\n\n### Comment ID kowujed with +2 score by [(wargio, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kowujed/) (in reply to ID kougagq):\nHello twin\n\n## Comment ID koup6yz with +23 score by [(Empirehulk, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/koup6yz/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nMy favorite picks are always Belerick, Baxia and Akai they are just the best roams for me.

Almost nobody knows how to take care of everyone, especially gold laner. In the game, either one of this will be fucked up, which is mid laner and gold laner. \n\n2. Almost nobody CAN initiate teamfight properly and perfectly. Most players do not like EXP heroes who can initiate or enter first, and choose damage-exp (such as Dyroth, Chou, etc), thus they rely heavily on roamer to create combo-wombo moment.\n\n3. Most of roamer users I met has quite low macro awareness, such as helping jungler to kill both red buff and bear creep, securing gold crab for gold laner, and checking parameters, also not being offside/ not being too passive. They do not even know where the right bush to check/secure.\n\n### Comment ID koum52m with +5 score by [(Edgyemo69, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/koum52m/) (in reply to ID kouj5tl):\nIt's as if my teammates want to lose and never tries to sync heroes according to teammates picks!\n\n### Comment ID kvcjqlg with +1 score by [(RADIENTLitex, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kvcjqlg/) (in reply to ID kouj5tl):\nShould I do damage or just sit there.

Your team has bulky jungler and exp? Pick a healer support like Rafa and make them nearly impossible to kill. You're lacking in the damage department? Give vision and pick offs with Natalia.

Pick Edith or Mino with an ungodly amount of cc and health.  \n\n\nBtw, my fave roam is Edith because you can adjust her to play exp, roam, gold, or even jungle in some occasions.

I also occasionally play mid and exp roles. Tanky heroes appeal to me, and I find roaming easier than other roles, requiring just one good set to impact the game significantly. I enjoy lurking in bushes to set up plays and prioritize keeping my damage dealers safe.\n\nInitially, I assist the jungler, If they perform well, I prioritize protecting them, even at the cost of my own life. However, if they struggle, I opt to support other teammates, like the exp or marksman, depending on who is performing better. I often find myself supporting Layla and Hanabi, despite their potential shortcomings, due to their high damage output and the potential for a comeback.\n\nWhile supports can be similar, I tend to avoid picking them unless we already have tanky exp and jungler roles covered.\n\n## Comment ID kouospz with +1 score by [(Lucky-Cellist417, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kouospz/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nFor me, MINATAUR\n\n## Comment ID kouqk03 with +1 score by [(Jib4ny4n, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kouqk03/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\noof...so sad not seeing my four-legged boi in here...\n\n## Comment ID kourd0a with +1 score by [(Falmelol, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kourd0a/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nYou don't HAVE TO play no damage roam, i personally have been enjoying direhit Selena since the roam/tank role haven't gotten any new heroes or big change, it is completely saturated, theres no real reason I play roam even though that's my \"main\" role, I just play it to adjust.

I like to kill then heal and give shield at the same time, so Mathilda is my go-to when the enemies are squishies.\n\nI also love being a nuisance so sometimes I go damage roam with guin or cici lol I still need to study more about tanks, they feel too slow for me yet requires fast hands\n\n### Comment ID kouwbbp with +2 score by [(Edgyemo69, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kouwbbp/) (in reply to ID kouviis):\nTank combos are hard to pull off also I like the idea of infuriating your enemies by healing your teammates never thought of that as it can effect the enemies playstyle!\n\n## Comment ID kouwj2g with +1 score by [(AdTime5032, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kouwj2g/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nRoaming back then used to be really fun, an entire game can be decided by 1 set.\n\nBut nowadays its really hard due to the meta constantly changing and how theres so many heroes with cc immunity/sustainability which makes my set useless after. \n\nThe only tank I really use for Roam right now tbh is mostly Minotaur, he's a great all-rounder. \n\nBut yeah me personally a 5 man set is more satisfying than a savage.\n\n### Comment ID kouwx88 with +1 score by [(Edgyemo69, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kouwx88/) (in reply to ID kouwj2g):\nThey should add achievement in game such as savage for saves and sets maybe that would encourage more people to roam!\n\n## Comment ID kouyac0 with +1 score by [(Blu3R4ptor, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kouyac0/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nBecause no one else would.\n\n## Comment ID kouyhr3 with +1 score by [(KrisGine, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kouyhr3/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nIf I pick anything else it's less likely that the roam will visit my lane (except mid cause I usually leave my lane to visit others so no need for a roamer in early game)\n\nIf I pick roam I'm sure to visit who needs it most, I'm sure I'll be right next to the objectives to help the jungler contest with turtle and Lord and I just like saving my team from their death either with healer, loli's shield or body blocking most attacks/flameshot (so satisfying ngl)\n\nMy team missing my initiate to fight thus leaving me to die is just one of the cons just as when laning, one of the cons is surviving when roam forgot to visit your lane.

His ult grants vision, meaning that you can start driving around as johnson first, then have aldous ult. Once aldous ults, he can pick a target, and you drive towards the target, and the jungle makes their way there too. you should be carrying your midlaner, and your gold can just walk over for the last bit of the teamfight.\n\niirc this is a team that was used in a tournament and it had a specific name, but i forgot.\n\nOverall, it can be done without aldous too, as long as your team is able to handle the teamfight well.\n\n## Comment ID kov570u with +1 score by [(Emergency_Silver_413, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kov570u/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nNeed to carry = Atlas, Kufra, Tigreal\n\nNeed to tank = Uranus, Belerick\n\nDominate early game? = Jhonson, Franco\n\n### Comment ID kov5gik with +1 score by [(Edgyemo69, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kov5gik/) (in reply to ID kov570u):\nKhufra seems to be a solid pick whenever I can't tell which tank is needed!\n\n## Comment ID kov5ty5 with +1 score by [(Jenhey0, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kov5ty5/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nTigreal doesn't exist?

It’s actually very simple: rotating is fun. \n\nAs EXP and MM, you’re confined to 2 lanes for the first 8 minutes for the most part apart from some minor rotations to mid if possible, and turtle fights. As JG and Mid, you do get to rotate a lot, but you’re also confined to clearing farm and your lane. Roam? As long as the enemy roam isn’t babysitting and overwhelming your MM, you have free reign to go anywhere on the map whenever you want. Gank wherever you want. Help whoever you want. There’s no rules as long as you make good decisions.\n\n### Comment ID kowoc2b with +1 score by [(kou3ai2lve1te1, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kowoc2b/) (in reply to ID kownyyi):\nPlus a few patches back (and still right now, honestly) DMG Mathilda is an EZ win in 99% of cases.\n\n## Comment ID kowrukd with +1 score by [(HLGrizzly, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kowrukd/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nBest part of roaming is you can roam as almost anyone if not anyone. And you dont have to just be a meat shield or healer. Personally Im almost always using Natalia, Tigreal or Fedrinn to roam. As Nat Im usually thinking who is my next target? How do I get to them? As Tigreal Im usually thinking where will the next gank be so I can counter them? As Fredrinn Im usually thinking of stalking and taunting enemy threats then comboing them into oblivion.\n\n## Comment ID kowsqyg with +1 score by [(strykerlmao03, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kowsqyg/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nMate 5 man ccs are just fun, I play more mage now cos I don't like to think, but when you have a nice read on the enemy, bait their skills n shit, that juicy 5 man ruby flicker hook into your tower where you have your enter gang waiting, orgasmic\n\n## Comment ID kowsw7b with +1 score by [(Hot-Ad-4566, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kowsw7b/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nSo i normally use different characters to roam. Who i use depends on the enemy lineup but My mains are: lolita, belerick, atlast, tank chou, selena. I also have a 62%+ win rate with lunox and kaggy but i find them boring. \n\nSo when playing roam, What normally goes through my head in no particular order is 1. Who needs help, 2. Objectives, 3. Sets and who can follow up, 4. Annoying enemy jg. \n\nAs a roam, I don't really care about getting kills or not doing damage (when not playing selena). What I care about is winning the match and getting alot of assist. You can get mvp or high gold pretty easily if your doing your part. When it comes to toxic teammates, many times these are the ones that overextend or try to 3v1 and die. I like to call them out on their bs, especially when they start blaming me. Most players know to engage when they see you set, but others might not know, so it's important to communicate. It's your job as roamer to basically be the coach so Communication is key. \n\nA good roam has alot of power that can determine the outcome of the match.  A good roam can make an average team better than it is. Yes it's true that the roam doesn't get as much credit as others. In fact, you get more props from the enemy team than your own because they know how difficult you made things for them. But once in awhile your team acknowledges your plays or when you save them. I roam cause I like to win.\n\n## Comment ID kowtgd6 with +1 score by [(Moist-Agency1366, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kowtgd6/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nRoam Natalia cuz i don't have to worry about my lane because i don't have one and if mm needs help i will beg the mage to help him\n\n## Comment ID kowvn0z with +1 score by [(Disappointed07, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kowvn0z/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nI only enjoy playing roams who can heal (Rafa, Floryn, Mathilda, Mino).\n\nI personally like the aspect of staying on the map as long as possible (thus my equally strong role being EXP) and also increasing my team's sustenance in a team fight.\n\nI guess in line with this I enjoy a war of attrition and also the ability to let my duo (usually MM) have a sort of power boost in the form of increased speed, healing and CC. Being able to heal also sorta gives my chosen teammate a \"get out of jail free\" card every 1min+ (revitalize + favor + heal = almost full health).\n\nThe last aspect being that players who arent as good (i.e. aside from high mythic) tend to under estimate where the \"line\" is w.r.t. their ability to win a fight once a healer is added to the equation. They tend to over extend without taking into account their inability to burst down a target due to the heals given and thus getting the fight turned around.\n\n## Comment ID kowzu3r with +1 score by [(NoobzProXD, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kowzu3r/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nIf roamer is a chess piece, it would be the queen, because a good roamer can help control the whole game, opening a path to an easy victory, just like a queen piece in chess\n\n## Comment ID kox1w63 with +1 score by [(DeliveryOk9016, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kox1w63/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\ni started playing mlbb witha  group of friends so i just adjusted as the roamer, they all chose mage jungle mm exp so i got stuck with roam\n\n## Comment ID kox4vsh with +1 score by [(claird3lun3, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kox4vsh/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nI love roaming because the burden of winning/protecting the lane don’t fall on me.

It suits older players and those who are not in the game to dash-s2-ba-s1-s1-ba-ult combo moves all day long. Roamers skills are set and individual and applied when needed. It's more where should I go and who needs to be supported so the team wins. \n\n2- Roams have group oriented skills. Group cc, group heal, group speed-up. The more the team works together, the more the value shines, and a good roamer saves the whole team and gives them an advantage. That's why Selena and Chou are ineffective roams for teams in most scenarios even if they get a high kill count, they neither counter team plays nor boost their team nor set fights for the team with area cc, most matches they cause their team to lose (except in situations where the team needed a second dedicated assassin to neutralize that pesky Estes/faramis at the beginning of a team fight). \n\n3- There are a few good roamer heroes that have nasty burst damage and so can still get in there and go \"fine, I'll kill them myself\" when needed, like Mathilda and Novaria. \n\n4- Roam is more likely to get gold and MVP due to assists than any other role, so we are fine with the low damage and are rewarded for the team support effort.\n\n5- A good experienced roam is a secondary leader that reminds junglers to take objectives and groups the team members when they forget themselves with solo chases. They're like a good COO. It's an enjoyable way of playing the game for some.\n\n## Comment ID koxrec7 with +1 score by [(xokhairina, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/koxrec7/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nI always end up using roam bcs nobody ever wants to roam lmao.

Out of 3k matches, likely 80% of those are roaming, and 60% of those was roaming as Angela. I play Angela becaise I love healing and protecting my allies. I play healers in every single video game — given the option.\n\nThe reason I roam is because I value pushing someone else to succeed more than my own successes. To quote Mercy from overwatch; \"Helping those in need is it's own reward.\"\n\nOn the other side of the coin, sometimes I want to play some crazy assassin/fighter jungler and get 20 kills in a match. It's like a guilty pleasure. Then they made Mathilda, so I just play Mathilda because I het to heal my team and assassinate the weak.\n\n#What are my goals in the early game\n\nIn the early game, (0:00 - 5:00) my goal is to help the marksman and jungler farm. I will attack creeps with my jungler and ward off anyone trying to hinder them (usually Franco). As for my marksman, my job isn't to keep them alive, my job is to make sure they farm. That means I want to keep them healthy enough to survive poke damage or hinder the enemy marksman. It's still the Marksman's job to keep themselves alive. They can blame me all they want for their own feeding, but we'll see who gets a gold medal at the end of the game. If I get a kill on the enemy marksman.\n\n#What are my goals mid game\n\nIn the late game, (5:00 - 15:00) I'm very squishy, and don't have the burst damage to make it for it. That means I can't be walking around by myself, but I still scout enemies to give my team vision. If I get killed and my team is nearby, the enemies put their abilities on cooldown for a roamer and they get punished for it. Because of that potential outcome, I rarely get attacked on the spot. \n\nI'm constantly scanning the mini map for isolated targets or 1-v-1s to ambush with my CC. Otherwise, I'm poking or just waiting around in a bush. I try don't often clear minion waves until late game so my team gets the gold.\n\n#What are my goals late game\n\nTeamfights.\n\nTeamfights. Teamfights. Teamfights. This is where I thrive the most. The jungler walked so the marksman can run, and now I need to make sure they stay alive so they can provide their sustained damage output. I will most often be scouting around objectives and defending turrets so my team can roam the map looking for ganks. \n\n#What do I expect from every other lane?\n\n**Gold laners**: \n\nI expect you to be able to take care of yourselves. When I started this game I found it hard to peel myself from gold lane. Now most of my time is soent in Jungle. Roamers are called *Roamers* for a reason. I need to help everyone, not just you guys on Gold. In the Epic rank, marksmen bark at me to protect them and only them. In Mythic, a lot of Gold laners want me to leave their lane. Funny how different that is. \n\nI expect you guys to try your best not to fall behind in gold and stay with me during late game. I offer you protection, you offer me kills.\n\n**Exp laners**:\n\nHelp the jungler secure at least one turtle in the early game. If you fall behind, hold your lane or help with ganks. \n\n**Mid laners**: \n\n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n**Junglers**:\n\nEither secure objectives, gank, or steal creeps. Something to put us ahead in gold. I'm pn standby to assist you the most in the early game.\n\ntl;dr I like healing\n\n## Comment ID koy7qpf with +1 score by [(Mulusy, Reddit, 2024-02-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/koy7qpf/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nIt’s not that I like to baby sit even tho it is a big part of my role.

Very wierd saying. Sertain tanks and supports are quite good assassins with damage builds. \"Forsed roamer\" and \"Everyday roamer\" is different because it takes practice to get gud, like in all other lanes, BUT roamer is harder because if you pick it, you are consent to get carried(or destroyed) by teammates.\n\nTanks usually the initiators, just suprise them by using bushes or Flickr and cc them to afk warning... Bonus points if you caught full team.\n\nSupports are exact opposite. You *rely* on teammates initiation and heal them, because if they die, you'll be just a free happy meal.\n\nAssassin roam ARE rare, but quite fun. Its like having seconds jungler that's a bit too slow on farm. Just pick off mm and/or jungler in a teamfight and its automatic win.\n\nWell, when you initiate and your teammates dick around rather follow up the initiation... its sad, really. Because if you caught all... That means all of them will kill you. But to fix it, my scariest advice is... to use any communications - voicechat, quickchat, pings. It works wonders when you can tell your intentions.\n\nThe usuall roamer route at the start at the game - leasing jungler, preventing any invades(franko, Tigreal, hilda, any other cocky bastard), helping mage clearing the wave, try to take river thingy, gank on lane most struggling with mage and/or jungler and then turtle. Mid to late just stick to teammates frontline(tank) or backline(support) and do your best to keep enemies from hurting them. Also its not bad if you die after good initiation that teammates followed up. Because if it were game-winning stunt, you can just kick back and see enemy base crumble.\n\n(God damn, it took quite long to write)\n\n## Comment ID kozo6fn with +1 score by [(misha4658, Reddit, 2024-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1aigs7z/roam/kozo6fn/) (in reply to ID 1aigs7z):\nI play roam selena.

Ubisoft doesn’t understand the potential money printer they have on their hands. \n\nThe combat system is so unique and also rewarding that it’s a shame it is completely scoped to this one game. Same thing with the graphical assets. They are really well made imo. \n\nThey could make a killer open world game. Imagine an open world RPG at the scale of something like skyrim, but with for honor combat? It might make me lose my job lol. \n\nOr even with just a FH2, there are so many options to expand the scope of their combat. They could very feasibly add ranged combat, like bows and magic. \n\nThis is something I’ve actually considered a lot. It’s such a missed opportunity.

The higher the Elo the harder it is for a mid roam to work.\n\nYet in Wildrift, it works every time. Roaming works because people lack the basic fundamentals of map awareness. Not every champion in mid can roam. If side lanes can react to roams and their mid didn't move mid that means they won the trade super hard. \n\nObviously to climb you have to adapt.

Sometimes, the Mid-Laner has no choice but to let the invade happen, or maybe they're just dumb and don't understand the matchup. Wild Rift is very young, so most people don't have every bit of knowledge unlocked.\n\nNow, don't argue that you've played LoL PC before, I did too, but there are several nuances that are different in this and that. We have no starter items, no potions, but we have honeyfruit in the lane, the lane is shorter, etc. The macro concepts are similar, but it's still a different experience than in PC.\n\nIs this an excuse for the people who don't know Macro? No, I've beaten challengers by applying Macro several times before, and when I'm negligent about macro and the enemy team knows how to, I will lose even to Emerald players. But we haven't perfected Wild Rift the same way that we've perfected the art of PC, it may take a few more years before we see WR Challengers have the same skill as PC Challengers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THIS IS WHERE THE ACTUAL EXPLANATION BEGINS**\n\n \n\nThere are several reasons why Mid-Lane just can't come over to help you, but the two I want to talk about is Priority/Lane State, and Matchup.\n\nPriority and Lane State - Picture this, you're a ranged Mid-Laner vs an assassin, who do you think gets priority in this lane? 9 times out of 10, you should have total control of the wave if you're playing it properly. Every time he steps up or goes for CS, he should lose his HP for being so disrespectful. In this lane, you have priority, and the lane state should be pushing into him, now let's transition to the next concept.\n\nMatchup - Picture this, you're a Lee Sin vs. Evelynn, and your Mid-Laner is Orianna vs Akali. No one is level 5 yet. Now, Orianna has Akali pinned down under tower, she's shutting down any attempts she makes and she's forced to be stuck under tower until 5. \n\nBut let's reverse the roles for a moment. You're now Evelynn, your Akali is stuck under tower, she has a big cannon wave to collect, and you're here dueling LEE SIN of all people for scuttle. You see Orianna coming over to help Lee beat you up until you see grey. You should've conceded earlier, but you need to leave NOW. You don't. You die, and there's nothing Akali could've done for you there. You need to pay attention to the matchup, you shouldn't even show your face to Lee Sin at all, and Orianna is a ranged champion vs Akali in early game, you shouldn't expect anything to happen cause she can't do anything. Just because your Mid-Laner didn't come to help you, doesn't mean she's stupid, the circumstances just didn't allow her to do anything about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow all of those things I told you about? Don't forget them, they're important, but your Mid-Laner just wasn't paying attention to the map at all LMAO.\n\n## Comment ID hr12ii9 with +22 score by [(RefanRes, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr12ii9/) (in reply to ID rur90t):\nSome champs in mid arent that good at roaming.

Roaming is matchup reliant. There is absolutely no point in let's say a Ziggs following an Ahri in to the river. Some champs are build to roam, and some aren't. It's up to the rest of the team to identify that and acknowledge that if enemy mid is off the map then play safer, because your mid doesn't have as much agency. \n\nNot that a ziggs should never roam, but by design, the champion is better at sieging than roaming for kills. Othe thing to consider is 2v2 matchup. If you're expecting your mid to rotate, when you're Evelyn and Lee Sin and for example a zed rotate and you're expecting your Kayle mid to come help. Yes people troll when not roaming when they should, but also people troll just as much taking skirmishes when they have no idea how the 2v2 matchup *should* work. - then blame mid for not rotating.\n\n### Comment ID hr5eoyp with +1 score by [(BlitzBlotz, Reddit, 2022-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr5eoyp/) (in reply to ID hr1z8g7):\n>There is absolutely no point in let's say a Ziggs following an Ahri in to the river.\n\nDepending on the situation you should clear the wave which shouldnt take more than 2/3 sec for ziggs and than follow ahri through your jungle, not river to the lane she tries to gank so you can ult into the gank if necessary.\n\nI see so many Ziggs players not utilizing his almost global presence properly.\n\n#### Comment ID hr77n61 with +1 score by [(Awwbelt, Reddit, 2022-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr77n61/) (in reply to ID hr5eoyp):\nAgree maybe walk to *your red buff* and use Ur ult as support damage. Then more than likely return to mid and attempt to take plates and deny waves. You will more than likely lose a 3v3 as ziggs - because he's suited to siege. Not roam. Nothing you have said counters my point, and in fact you agree ziggs shouldn't walk down river with Ahri. \n\nThat alone gives Ahri time to gank while I'm still walking through my jungle. Ziggs isn't a roamer. Ori isnt a roamer. Some champs want to deny waves instead. If it's ziggs Vs kat, and kat keeps roaming bot for double kills - that's not mid diff, that's bot diff.\n\n## Comment ID hr24e26 with +8 score by [(Sgrinfio, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr24e26/) (in reply to ID rur90t):\nI find the opposite quite common lol.

If I try to follow normally, I would be late anyway because I have to wait for confirmation of her walking on the scuttle crab, otherwise I wouldn't know if she was waiting for me in a bush.\n\n Btw no,it was an awful and telegraphed gank, it's literally never going to work if you as a toplaner look at the map at least once every 5 seconds, thing that Fiora didn't do at all. I would rather use my time to push the wave, make Ahri lose minions and use my free time to place a ward\n\n## Comment ID hr1u294 with +3 score by [(Willylongboard, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr1u294/) (in reply to ID rur90t):\nIf the enemy mid is being aggressive and constantly pushing I won't roam freely until they do.

TF however can roam even though he's not a strong early game champ because he can teleport. Galio is also a roaming mid because he's pretty good early and has teleport. Assassins should try to win lane and roam whenever possible because they have mobility to move quickly to other lanes or escape from enemy jungler when caught, need kills to snowball, and are usually quite strong in the early game.\n\nMy experience being a midlane Orianna main for the last two seasons is that when I roam too much, my gold advantage just disappears even though my jungler helped me get first blood. So when I face a relatively equal matchup, I rarely roam unless a fight around neutral objectives is happening, or I am very certain that I can get a kill or help my teammates get a kill when roaming (enemy laners are very low on hp, skills on cooldown, overpush, enemy jungler is in the opposite lane, laners/jungler are ready to skirmish, etc.)\n\n## Comment ID hr208a3 with +2 score by [(BLAST_V, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr208a3/) (in reply to ID rur90t):\nIts mostly lane priority\n\n## Comment ID hr1818o with +1 score by [(manukalele, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr1818o/) (in reply to ID rur90t):\nI only roam after t1 mid is down. Opening the mid towers is far more important than that kata going bot after I spam ping retreat. Like every assassin mid thinks they need to roam and leave the enemy mid laner free to get plates and farm. After t1 is down I just push the wave and go bot or mid trying to pickoff someone rotating in the jungle. People doesnt figured it out that 2 waves worth more than one kill, its just doesnt show in the scoreboard.\n\n### Comment ID hr1oncr with +4 score by [(Vrast, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr1oncr/) (in reply to ID hr1818o):\n???Most Mid lane champs take towers slow AF, Tf isn't even designed to win his lane, most games Bot and top towers go down first that means you're useless I hope you're never in my games\n\n### Comment ID hr1qb4w with +1 score by [(plzpizza, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr1qb4w/) (in reply to ID hr1818o):\nthats why your still in the elo you are in\n\n### Comment ID hr1qrld with +1 score by [(ItsLoudB, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr1qrld/) (in reply to ID hr1818o):\nThat kata getting a double kill because you didn’t follow up is way worse than losing one plate.

      "# [ROAM is an Open World Wild Horse Simulator and There's a Free Demo Available Now! — The Mane Quest by Alice Ruppert on 2024-09-02](https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2024/9/2/roam-is-a-sandbox-game-where-you-play-as-a-wild-worse-thats-up-to-no-good-and-theres-a-free-demo-available)\n“What about a horse game where you play AS THE HORSE\"?” is a demand I see in the TMQ-Communities quite often. When people imagine a game like this, they often start hoping for survival gameplay, complex herd dynamics and some sort of Spirit - Stallion of the Cimarron vibe.\n\nROAM - The Horse Game is a WIP-game that takes this “play as the horse” idea as its base line, but then twists it into a slightly different direction: mischief and mayhem. Think Goat Simulator and Untitled Goose Game. Considering the explosive success of those titles and my years of market research into why we absolutely need more horse games, the business case honestly writes itself.\n\nSolo developer Gen is a college student and self-described newbie game developer. “I was a complete horse girl growing up and I played every horse game I could get my hands on,” she describes herself on Patreon. Gen has been working on the ROAM prototype in her free time for not even two months and is launching a free demo today. In the Demo, you can create your own custom low-poly horse, gather a herd around yourself and explore an open world to free captured horses and mess with townspeople. She posts her progress on TikTok and Patreon, where Spirit-inspired gameplay compilations like this one have been getting a lot of attention.\n\nGen names Grand Theft Auto and Goat Simulator as inspirations, which is a wonderfully fresh take on our niche if you ask me. I’ve only given the demo a quick try so far, but I definitely see a lot potential in the idea, especially with a little bit more polish and UX improvements. For a project less than two months into development by someone without much gamedev experience, there’s already quite a lot to play around with, and ROAM has the sort of instantly recognizable USPs that I often find missing in Indie Horse Games.\n\nThe game currently uses Horse Animset Pro for its horse animations, which I’ve complained about on various occasions as regular readers will know. But honestly, quick prototyping with fresh ideas is about the best use case for such assets, and helps make game development significantly more accessible for first timers like Gen.\n\nGen tells me that she’s currently working on implementing breeding mechanics, and wild animals that chase you, though those features are not part of the demo yet.\n\nAlthough Gen has set up a Patreon for her game, the membership is entirely free and is intended to stay that way, she tells me via email. Eventually, Gen would like to make back the money she spent on the assets by selling the game, but those plans are not too concrete yet.\n\nIt’s a great opportunity to give your love and support to someone bringing fresh energy into our genre in any case – while remembering of course that any first time solo dev will always have certain limitations and that we shouldn’t get our hopes impossibly high.\n\nTo try the demo for yourself, you can join ROAM’s Patreon for free and download a .zip file from there. Please note that downloading an unvetted .zip or .exe file from someone’s website always carries more risk than downloading games from widely trusted sources such as Steam. I personally haven’t had any issues with the demo however. The Patreon post with the download also includes a PDF with technical information like system requirements, common issues and a Google form to submit feedback!\n\nROAM - The Horse Game is in an early prototype stage. A free Demo can be found here, concrete release plans for other platforms are not known yet. For updates, follow ROAM on Patreon (free) or TikTok.",

      "# [How to be a Norwegian parent: let your kids roam free, stay home alone, have fun – and fail by Andy Welch, www.theguardian.com, andy-welch on 2024-07-11](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/11/how-to-be-a-norwegian-parent-let-your-kids-roam-free-stay-home-alone-have-fun-and-fail)\nIt’s 1.30pm. Nila and Arion arrive home after finishing school for the day. They let themselves in, make some food, then sit down to do homework, or practise piano, or do the housework they’ve been asked to do. Their parents won’t be home for a few hours yet. The children sometimes go out with friends to play in the street or wander the fields. The only real rule is no screen time unless everything else has been taken care of.\n\nSo far, so normal, perhaps, except the sister and brother are just 10 and eight, and they’ve been living this kind of unsupervised mini-adult life for years.\n\nThey live in Stavanger, on the south-west coast of Norway. Like all of their friends, they’ve been walking to and from school alone since they first attended at the age of six. They were given their own set of house keys soon after. This is the parenting way in Norway – it’s decidedly free-range, with an emphasis on independence, self-determination and responsibility, with a dash of outdoor fun thrown in for good measure.\n\nI’ve known Nila and Arion since they were born (their parents are close friends), and I have consistently marvelled at the space and freedom they are given. On my visits to their home, I can never help but compare their upbringing with the way I and millions of other Britons were raised. While not exactly repressive or restrictive, 80s British parenting didn’t value autonomy in the same way. I certainly didn’t get my own chef’s knife for my eighth birthday, as Nila did a couple of years ago. She puts it to good use; she’s solely responsible for cooking dinner for the family one night a week.\n\n“I can’t think of anyone who doesn’t parent like this,” says Nila and Arion’s dad, Giancarlo Napoli. He recalls one child in Nila’s class whose parents moved to another town a few years back. Rather than switch schools, this child now walks 20 minutes from his home to the train station, takes a 20-minute train journey, then has another 20-minute walk at the other end from the station to school. “This kid does that twice a day, and no one bats an eyelid,” he says. (On a related note, Norwegian children as young as seven have been known to make solo journeys from one end of Norway to the other to visit their divorced parents.)\n\nGiancarlo is British, and moved to Stavanger in 2006 after meeting his Norwegian wife, Lena, while travelling. He teaches at a nearby college and is now a fully integrated member of Norwegian society – and a paid-up member of the free-range parenting club. But he admits it did take him some time to adjust.\n\nOf course, free-range parenting does rather fit in with perceptions outsiders often have about Scandinavian people. Look at them all, with their hygge, and their sky-high living standards, low crime rates, enviable maternity and paternity rights and exceptional aesthetics. Norway is indeed seventh on the World Happiness Report. It also has the world’s 10th highest GDP, along with the world’s largest wealth fund and one of the world’s lowest crime rates. But this is a philosophy that runs deeper than Norway’s pockets, and it’s been around far longer than the country’s well-funded public services have.\n\nThere’s evidence that Viking children as far back as the ninth century were raised in a relatively similar way: treated as adults and expected to chip in with whatever work needed to be done. It’s a way of life, deeply ingrained to the point that most Norwegians I’ve spoken to can’t understand either the fascination with their method, or why anyone would do it differently.\n\nThis more nuanced modern take – more conversations about feelings, less pillaging – rose to prominence in the aftermath of the second world war, says Willy-Tore Mørch, emeritus professor in children’s mental health at the University of Tromsø. Much of the country’s infrastructure had been devastated by the years of Nazi occupation. Rising to the challenge, the newly formed Labour government believed that all Norwegians should contribute to the rebuilding – children included.\n\n“The children had to be strong and hardened, and trained to be independent and loyal,” says Mørch. “Perhaps most parents today are not aware of this history, but building trust between parents and children remains a basic relational quality in modern Norwegian child-raising.”\n\nThere is also another, more practical reason underpinning some of this parenting style. “Most women here work,” says Mette Tveit, a curator and historian at Stavanger Museum. Norway has among the most gender-equal workforces, with about 73% of all men of working age in employment, and about 67% of women. Childcare is also widely available and highly affordable, meaning that going out to work is financially worthwhile. For example, kindergarten fees for 10 hours a day, five days a week, are capped at NOK 2,000 (£150) a month. In the UK, the average cost for under-twos in full-time childcare is £300 a week.\n\nTveit adds that Norwegian children are, in her experience, so independent that they organise their own playdates with peers. “I spend time in the US and I see how the parents arrange those things, but in Norway, even young children will organise their social events and manage their spare time. They just get on with things. It’s normal for Norwegian children to tell their parents what they’re doing; it’s not that normal to ask permission. They are just trusted to make good decisions.”\n\nTrust is something that comes up when I talk to Giancarlo and Lena about their parenting, and how mutual respect is crucial. In the school holidays, for example, they’re happy for Nila and Arion to be out all day as long as they know roughly what time they’ll return – and the children comply. Lena says this is how her mother and grandmother were raised, and fondly remembers going to school herself as a six-year-old with a front door key around her neck on a piece of string. She also thinks this way of parenting should be preserved, despite the temptation to introduce technology into the equation.\n\n“You can get GPS watches for kids, where you can track them and so on,” she says. “[But] it’s really important to me that it’s not a fake sense of freedom that we give the children. There was one time we thought Nila had gone missing, and even though I know if she’d had one of those watches we could’ve just checked to see where she was and not been worried, that’s not the point.”\n\nIt turns out Nila had been playing out with a friend when the friend’s grandparent invited them indoors for a drink and an iced bun and she had simply lost track of time. “It was important for her to see we were worried, and she’s never done it again,” says Lena.\n\nFailure, it seems, is a big part of Norwegian parenting – enjoy the freedom to make mistakes, but learn from them. There’s a tacit understanding that yes, you can climb that tree, but you might fall and hurt yourself. Or maybe falling will make you a better climber in future?\n\nThe usual safety features parents of other nationalities might install in their home are normally lacking in Norway, too. Giancarlo says that while log-burners are almost standard issue, he can’t remember seeing a guard around one, while stair gates are unusual. “We probably should’ve had a safety gate at the top of the stairs, but we didn’t – we just told the kids not to go down them. Just as we said: ‘Don’t touch the log-burner, it’s very hot.’” There is perhaps another piece to be written about Norwegians being strict conformists. For that, let’s blame Janteloven, an unofficial moral code that seems to guide Nordic countries. In summary – following rules: good; exceptionalism: bad.\n\nMørch says the Norwegian parenting style cannot be understood without assessing the influence of the psychologist Åse Gruda Skard. Skard was a famous figure in postwar Norway, where she appeared on radio programmes and in newspapers to spread her groundbreaking ideas on “free child-rearing” as a response to the authoritarianism seen before and during the war.\n\n“The US had Benjamin Spock, and we had Skard,” says Mørch. “She strongly opposed a punishment-oriented parenting style, instead teaching parents to look at things from the child’s perspective, to ask: what does the child experience in this situation? What does the child understand now? How can I help the child to understand what’s going on? How can I support the child in this situation?”\n\nAs much as I admire the way my friends have raised their children – both of them kind, inquisitive, fun and well-mannered – as a recent new parent, these techniques remain aspirational for the most part, and I can’t imagine adopting many of them myself. I’m all for having a rugged, outdoorsy child who can cook, but I’m not so sure about my future five-year-old returning home to tell me he’d been working on his stick whittling and knife skills at his London nursery – as preschoolers do here in Stavanger.\n\nAccording to Justine Roberts, the CEO of Mumsnet, I’m not alone in my admiration for the Nordic way of parenting, or my reticence in trying it myself. “Generally, users like the freedom that children have in the Scandi way of doing things, and the fact that it can all contribute to a healthier lifestyle with more outside play. There’s also a feeling that children are more integrated into society,” she says.\n\n“But I think, over the years, UK society has become more risk averse. If you just look at the way attitudes to outside play have changed over the last generation, it’s very clear that parents are more reluctant to take on even the smallest risk.”\n\nRoberts believes British parents became more scared of unsupervised outdoor play sometime in the early 90s, and blames the decade’s breathless media coverage of the threats posed by paedophiles, violent crime and road traffic accidents. “The crime rate is definitely a factor,” she says. “Most mums agree that it just wouldn’t be possible to parent like that here. It’s a shame because giving kids freedom to run around with their friends outside seems to have many advantages – for the children and their parents.”\n\nTalking of what’s possible, there’s a saying in Norwegian: Det finnes ikke dårlig vær, bare dårlige klær (“There’s no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing”). And it starts in kindergarten, where children are sent with a range of equipment and clothing for anything the climate can throw at them. And know this – they will be outside at some point during the day, whatever the weather.\n\n“When we are outside, we encourage the children to try to get over obstacles, climb rocks and walk on rough terrain,” says Hanne Myhre, who works as a pedagogical leader in a kindergarten in Stavanger, caring for children. “This improves the children’s motor skills, and we find that they become more robust and independent. Sometimes they fall and maybe hurt themselves, but they are comforted by the staff and after a while we can encourage them to try again.” Myhre adds that children are expected to dress themselves (with support, if needed) from the age of two.\n\nFor her, the key to the Norwegian model, particularly in Stavanger, is the number of smaller kindergartens and schools located in each neighbourhood, meaning that while children do travel to and from school alone, it is usually a relatively short walk. “Of course, it helps that there is low crime,” she says. “And we trust other people, but we are not naive. As well as all the other lessons, we also teach children not to go anywhere with strangers and we practise safe walking in traffic.”\n\nShe believes instilling these skills helps foster independence, but boosts confidence, too, leading to mature adolescents and steady, grounded adults with a head for decision-making. That was the consensus among everyone I spoke to for this piece, although it is, of course, difficult to know which of the traits someone has in adulthood came from the way they were raised and which came from elsewhere, just as it’s impossible to tell how someone might have turned out if they had been raised in a different way.\n\nFor most Norwegians, though, this is a way of life, and not something that is endlessly questioned or even really observed, although there are naysayers.\n\n“This parenting style has been exposed to criticism in the past 10 to 15 years,” says Prof Mørch. “Just as ‘curling parents’ (who sweep away any obstacles for the child), ‘helicopter parents’ (who monitor their child all the time) and ‘cotton parents’ (who pack their child in cotton wool to prevent any accident) have been criticised.”\n\nCritics of free-range parenting, he says, have called for more limit-setting, but he strongly disagrees, arguing that free-range children will learn all they need to about the world without unnecessary intervention. “They do not need parents to organise their problems.”\n\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Initially I thought it was a fault with the accelerator, but when I lifted off the slowdown was different. So, I decided it may be a fault with my brake pedal. So I altered the dead zones as indicated in settings for when pressure is supplied and should be in the neutral position. I did this and set it at 20 inside and 90 outside for brake settings.\n\nHowever, the problem continued, so I decided to drive the car in Free Roam to see if it would happen again. The car behaved normally and no slow down on the freeway section. i.e. being a long enough road to have the problem appear compared to in a race on Horizon Circuit Mexico\n\nI also have Forza Motorsport '23, F1 22 and The Crew Motorfest and the problem does not happen in these games at all.\n\nSo searched the internet and saw a link with a similar issue in FH4\n\nI then had the idea to see what happens with the telemetry on screen. That is when I noticed that the Accelerator was at 100% and the brake was at 0% in normal race mode. However, then when the car slows down the accelerator is at 100%, but the brake increases to 20% even when my foot is not on the brake pedal.",

After letting that go, I would get kicked out of the lobby when I tried to enter the garage in free roam. After adjusting to that and changing my cars in the meet ups, the final progression was I was unable to join a lobby. After a loading screen that seemed like forever, I would get kicked back to the main screen and would be signed out of EA.\n\nIssue: BOTH... of your cars and custom wraps in your single player garage AND free roam garage, counts as individual cars and wraps. Once you go above 100ish cars (combined), you'll start to have 1 if not all of the issues that I had.\n\nFix: And this is painful; Sell cars and delete wraps. But there's a catch. IF, you had a custom wrap on your car, and you sell your car, the wrap remains, and the issues remains. For those cars, you have to sell the car, select another car, go into the wrap modification page, select ALL WRAPS. Then, you will see the custom wraps you have \"applied\" and custom wraps that don't say \"applied\". THOSE wraps that don't have \"applied\" above them; belong to cars you have sold. DELETE THEM! IF, you have wraps you don't like OR wraps on cars you hardly loose, delete the wraps. Use whatever color that comes with the car natively.\n\nNOW, remember I said both single player and multi-player shared the \"car and wrap count\". You have to go into your single player mode and do the same thing. EVERY CAR you win/unlock on multiplayer, YOU GET IN SINGLE PLAYER and doubles your car count. DELETE/SELL THOSE!\n\nAFTER, you sell cars, delete wraps from BOTH garages, you'll need to re-sync your game, shut the game down, try to get in. You should have no problems until your car counts rise again.\n\nI'm sitting at around 130 ish cars but only 40ish custom wraps and didn't have an issue after doing the above UNTIL last night where I unlocked and new Cop Car. Now, the \"unable to create lobby\" error is back. (I have also won some cars due to the season progression). I'll have to go into single player and delete those cars to get rid of that error.\n\nGRIPE to EA: You have a game that: Requires you complete certain challenges with certain cars in different classes. YOU award cars as players progress through the seasons, YOU allow customization of cars and purchase of multiple cars. YOU have multiple events that require special parts to participate in that you can't modify immediately before a race, requiring you to have multiple cars with different set ups (drift pro for example). YET, IF YOU DO ANY OF THAT TO AN EXTENT, YOU CAN'T PLAY THE GAME. I'm personally about 1.5 error messages away for asking for my money back, as I can't DO what the game advertises a player SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO. You've created a game that awards progression with cars that then breaks the game so you can't play. Makes no sense. This isn't a new issue, i've read about this in other forums for the last year or so. PLEASE FIX!\n\nTO the players: I hope this helps and gets you back online. Let me know if it did or if you need to be talked through anything.",

      "# [Re: Free Roam Online in Unbound no longer works since Update Vol 8 by answers.ea.com, user-id on 2024-09-07](https://answers.ea.com/t5/Technical-Issues/Unable-to-play-free-roam/m-p/14025564)\nHi EA_Illium, when I try to get into free roam, it takes a long time to load and the screen goes black after the loading scene.\n\nAfter that, it breaks off and automatically returns to the main menu. Then I have to reconnect to the server and go online. I get into the online garage and no error message appears.\n\nThen I try to get into free roam again, it loads for a long time again, breaks off and I get back into the main menu, then I connect to the server.\n\nSynchronization starts, then an error message FTCL5001 appears. This message doesn't always appear, sometimes it appears, sometimes none, sometimes the system doesn't synchronize at all.\n\nMaybe after an hour or two, after about 30 logins, I get in once. Then I was kicked out of the lobby after about a minute, but if I get straight into free roam, I'm not kicked out of the lobby.\n\nHey @EA_Illium @ZimtsternLalaliu this temporary workaround has worked for me. Un installing one DLC didn't do it though, each time it didn't work I uninstalled another and tried again.\n\nIt finally worked once I had just the base game installed and now I am currently re installing everything.\n\n* A weird thing I noticed was that even though I had uninstalled all the custom packs I had bought, I still had all my DLC cars and the option to buy them in the dealership.\n\nEven in story mode\n\nHopefully it's nothing, I'm just happy my game is working again. Thank You very much @EA_Illium\n\nHey @EA_Illium @ZimtsternLalaliu so I think I might've celebrated early\n\nAfter I got my game working I played for a bit and took a break. When I went to return to online, it started playing up once again exactly the same issues\n\nIt looks like I'm going to have to uninstall and reinstall my dlc every time I want to play online because that seems to be all that fixes it\n\nHi everyone, I've already tried uninstalling the individual DLC packs and then the complete DLC packs. A new installation without all the DLC didn't help either. The error remains unfortunately.\n\n@TheHondaToday after about 50 login attempts and hours I get into free roam, I think it was by chance, without me having to uninstall or reinstall anything.\n\nSometimes I get kicked out of the lobby after a few seconds if I don't leave the garage immediately. Even if you want to return to the garage at some point, you get kicked out of the lobby.\n\nI didn't notice that the cars from the DLC can still be in the garage and available for purchase despite being uninstalled.",

For Naruto OG season, they skipped the fight between CS2 Sasuke and 9T Chakra Naruto at the valley of the end. It was just crazy.\n\nalso for no reason they excluded all the other character battles that Storm 3 and Storm 4 added in their history modes. This game is weird because they made a valiant effort to strip story. But then strangely added one or two QTE battles from each Storm game.\n\nstorm 1 got Shukaku fight. Storm 2 got Sasuke vs Itachi.

      "# [K-pop fans, Olympians roam Korea House as Games take over French capital by koreajoongangdaily.joins.com on 2024-08-06](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2024-08-06/sports/olympics/Kpop-fans-Olympians-roam-Korea-House-as-Games-take-over-French-capital/2106324)\nJIM BULLEY\n\njim.bulley@joongang.co.kr\n\nPARIS — The halls of Korea House were packed Monday as An Se-young romped to a historic badminton gold medal, fans of Team Korea braving the Parisian heat to watch the big screen in the garden while hundreds more visitors explore the cultural exhibitions inside.\n\nAn’s win — met with a combination of largely Korean cheering and largely French polite clapping — was the backdrop to a morning of Korean culture, Korean food and Korean beer for a crowd that appeared to be about a 50-50 split between Korean fans and local visitors.\n\nCountry houses are a common feature at the Olympics. Typically a local building taken over by a temporary international tenant, country houses act as both a base for non-competing staff members and a home away from home for the country’s PR initiatives.\n\nDepending on the country they can range from a simple press room to a cultural hub or even a place to party.\n\n“I love Korean culture, and our friends said the food here is good,” Marie, 24, told the Korea JoongAng Daily at the Korea House Monday.\n\nA local Parisian, Marie was visiting Korea House with two friends. The group made a beeline for the “K-pop World in Photoism” booth, a K-pop themed version of the “four-cut” photo booths common in Korea. It cost a steep 10 euros (15,000 won) for the experience in Paris, but Marie and her friends didn’t blink at the price.\n\n“10 euros here is a lot cheaper than a flight to Korea,” she said. “This week Korea has come to us. I’m not going to complain about the price.”\n\nWhile the garden hosted the viewing party, complete with Cass beer on tap and Bibigo food, the halls of the Maison de la Chimie, currently rebranded as Korea House, are focused on Korean culture.\n\nWith hanbok on display and plenty for K-pop lovers to enjoy, the crowd inside Korea House skews younger and seems to be here more for a slice of Korea than anything specifically related to the Olympics.\n\n“The kids love K-pop,” said Leon, who was visiting Korea House with his two children and standing stoically in the queue for the photo booths while they went to find the K-culture pin badges. “They heard about this event on Instagram and asked to come. It’s the school holidays and it’s free, so of course I was happy.”\n\nOut in the garden the Olympics are still in full swing.\n\nIt’s a more Korean crowd outside, with a mixture of Korean tourists and the local Korean diaspora. Youngmi and her husband live in Paris and have come to Korea House for a mini homecoming. The prerecorded chants — the badminton has English commentary, but with Korean chanting played over it between sets — making it feel like she’s back in Busan.\n\nThere are Olympians here as well. Kim Woo-min, a bronze medalist in Paris and the second Korean ever to medal in Olympic swimming, is doing the rounds, signing t-shirts as he tried to watch the badminton final. He wanted to go to the game, he told reporters here earlier, but couldn't get tickets.\n\nBut it’s not all K-pop fans and homesick Koreans. There is also a sporting element to the Korea House crowd, in Paris for the Games but without a ticket on this particular morning.\n\nSteve, from Canada, is one of those guests. An Olympic aficionado, this is his fifth Games and a love of fencing has bought him to Korea House.\n\n“The country houses are the best part of the Olympics these days,” he tells the Korea JoongAng Daily whilst sitting in the sun with a glass of beer. “Countries put so much effort into these places and the experience gets better every time. I didn’t have anywhere else to be today and Korea’s on my radar because I follow fencing, so I thought why not come here and check it out.”\n\nAnd what does he think of the Cass? “No comment.”\n\nBY JIM BULLEY [jim.bulley@joongang.co.kr]"

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on Roam and Its Product: ROAM - The Horse Game\n\n## Company Overview: Roam\nRoam is an indie game development project led by a solo developer known as Gen, who is currently a college student. The project focuses on creating a unique gaming experience centered around horses, tapping into a niche that has seen limited exploration in the gaming industry. Gen describes herself as a \"complete horse girl\" who has a deep passion for horse games, which informs her development approach [(Ruppert, The Mane Quest, 2024-09-02)](https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2024/9/2/roam-is-a-sandbox-game-where-you-play-as-a-wild-worse-thats-up-to-no-good-and-theres-a-free-demo-available).\n\n## Product Overview: ROAM - The Horse Game\nROAM is an open-world wild horse simulator that allows players to experience life as a horse. The game is currently in the prototype stage, with a free demo available for players to explore. The gameplay emphasizes mischief and mayhem, drawing inspiration from popular titles like *Goat Simulator* and *Untitled Goose Game* [(Ruppert, The Mane Quest, 2024-09-02)](https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2024/9/2/roam-is-a-sandbox-game-where-you-play-as-a-wild-worse-thats-up-to-no-good-and-theres-a-free-demo-available). Players can create custom low-poly horses, gather herds, and engage in various activities, including freeing captured horses and interacting with townspeople.\n\n### Development and Features\nGen has been developing ROAM for less than two months and has already launched a demo that showcases the game's core mechanics. The demo allows players to create their own horse and explore an open world, which has garnered attention on platforms like TikTok and Patreon [(Ruppert, The Mane Quest, 2024-09-02)](https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2024/9/2/roam-is-a-sandbox-game-where-you-play-as-a-wild-worse-thats-up-to-no-good-and-theres-a-free-demo-available). Future updates are expected to include breeding mechanics and interactions with wild animals, although these features are not yet part of the demo.\n\n### Community Engagement and Funding\nGen has set up a Patreon page for ROAM, which is currently free to join. The intention behind the Patreon is to build a community around the game and eventually recoup costs associated with game development. However, Gen has indicated that monetization plans are still in the early stages [(Ruppert, The Mane Quest, 2024-09-02)](https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2024/9/2/roam-is-a-sandbox-game-where-you-play-as-a-wild-worse-thats-up-to-no-good-and-theres-a-free-demo-available).\n\n## Market Potential and Competitive Landscape\nThe gaming market has seen a resurgence in interest for unique and niche titles, particularly those that allow players to engage with animals in creative ways. The success of games like *Goat Simulator* suggests a viable market for ROAM, especially given the lack of similar horse-themed games. Gen's approach to game design, focusing on fun and engaging gameplay rather than strict realism, positions ROAM favorably within the indie gaming landscape [(Ruppert, The Mane Quest, 2024-09-02)](https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2024/9/2/roam-is-a-sandbox-game-where-you-play-as-a-wild-worse-thats-up-to-no-good-and-theres-a-free-demo-available).\n\n## Executive Insights\nGen, the developer behind ROAM, has expressed her enthusiasm for creating a game that resonates with players who share her love for horses. She has stated, “What about a horse game where you play AS THE HORSE?” highlighting her commitment to fulfilling a demand within the gaming community for more horse-centric gameplay experiences [(Ruppert, The Mane Quest, 2024-09-02)](https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2024/9/2/roam-is-a-sandbox-game-where-you-play-as-a-wild-worse-thats-up-to-no-good-and-theres-a-free-demo-available).\n\n## Conclusion\nRoam, through its product ROAM - The Horse Game, is positioned to tap into a niche market with significant potential for growth. The combination of engaging gameplay, community involvement through platforms like Patreon, and a clear vision from the developer creates a promising outlook for the project. As the game continues to develop, it will be essential for Gen to maintain transparency with her community and adapt to feedback to enhance the gaming experience. \n\nFor prospective candidates and investors, ROAM represents an opportunity to engage with an innovative project that seeks to redefine the horse gaming genre."
