At this point I can no longer trust it to work more than 30 minutes and thinking this thing is a piece of garbage. I have lots of other Sonos products which I’m very happy with, but the roam seems to be made by a different company from a quality perspectives \n\nJust tonight it went from 100% to 20% within a couple of minutes. In between that it made this super loud streaking white noise before shutting down.\n\nI’ve done factory resets multiple times and at this point I think I got a lemon. Anyone else have a similar experience?\n\n## Comment ID jonua62 with +16 score by [(Rahrah12, Reddit, 2023-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/14d0vf8/anyone_else_extremely_disappointed_with_the_roam/jonua62/) (in reply to ID 14d0vf8):\nPicked up a Roam not to long ago…haven’t experienced any of the issues mentioned here…fingers crossed I don’t…\n\n### Comment ID joojtrj with +3 score by [(be_matthew, Reddit, 2023-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/14d0vf8/anyone_else_extremely_disappointed_with_the_roam/joojtrj/) (in reply to ID jonua62):\nI believe it's not completely the speaker. It's the user's apps, devices, wifi, etc. that are connected to it causing issues.\n\nI do have the latest iPhone, a newish Macbook, and my wifi is extremely fast.

I regularly use WiFi and BT modes but the only time I ever press the button on the back is to wake/sleep. I would actually prefer the Move to work this way too so I didn't have to physically interact with the speaker. \n\nI love my Roam, it always gets carried around with me and never had any issues. I have Sonos in every room in the house and the Roam quite often gets added to a corner somewhere to fill the sound out in whichever space I'm listening.\n\n### Comment ID joopbcu with +10 score by [(GrandExhange, Reddit, 2023-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/14d0vf8/anyone_else_extremely_disappointed_with_the_roam/joopbcu/) (in reply to ID jool46w):\nThat's the thing, from what I'm reading, it seems that people haven't bothered reading the manual/experiment with the speaker.\n\nI like my roam too.

I have a sound bar connected to my TV and am very happy with it. I needed a portable speaker that has a little more \"oomph\" to replace my aging Bluetooth one. I can't believe I can't use the app without WiFi, or how connecting the Bluetooth is so damn infuriating, or that it can't hold a connection, or remember that I connected to it previously.

There are tons of options with great sound for less money. The only advantage of the Roam is using it in a multi-room Sonos setup, which isn’t a consideration when not at home on your WiFi.\n\n#### Comment ID joo426d with +1 score by [(Notyourfathersgeek, Reddit, 2023-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/14d0vf8/anyone_else_extremely_disappointed_with_the_roam/joo426d/) (in reply to ID joo0ogc):\nI actually just bought the roam because it’s small, so it fits where the sound is kinda low in my house.

Lots of other people do seem to have issues with the roam though. One thing that I’ve realized sometimes helps is to select the speaker you want to play to.  Then start the music, podcast, or other audio source. I use airplay to play podcasts to my roam and sometimes it is finicky connecting if I unplug it and then try to start playing right to it. Usually if I select it as the target speaker, play the audio, then unplug I have no problems with the roam. I was actually surprised how little battery it used this past weekend.  I was playing podcasts with it for a few hours and when I was done said it was still at 80%. I also have reliable fast WiFi at my house so not sure it that helps.

That's the jg.\n\nJg is basically roam+. You do what roam does and then some extra. On one hand, you're probably going to be using heroes that have some of the most obnoxious power spikes and playmaking potential, on top of two buffs and a fast level 4. On the other hand, that means the team has *you* to look to to find the straws that will break the camel's back, and turn the tides of an even or even a losing game.\n\nThe stakes are higher, too. If the roam is sent to base multiple times or has some bad sets/kill secures, it's fine, they have utility that is nonreliant on maintaining a lead and can always play from behind, leaving the teammates to pull off the heavylifting of damage and objective secure. As jg, *you are the damage and objective secure*. If you go down, if you can't find a way to outplay your enemy or lose your lead, your entire team is probably doomed.\n\n## Comment ID lnugpd7 with +7 score by [(Maximum-Shrimping, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnugpd7/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nA good roam makes jungling easier. \nA good jungle makes winning the game easier. \n\nThey coexist.\n\n### Comment ID lnugukq with +1 score by [(NoobzProXD, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnugukq/) (in reply to ID lnugpd7):\nThis one seems to be the most reasonable, mlbb is a coop game after all\n\n#### Comment ID lnuhnos with +5 score by [(Maximum-Shrimping, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuhnos/) (in reply to ID lnugukq):\nI have 1 thing to add. \n\nPeople that think roamer is easy are also the same one that thinks that roamer should babysit gold lane.\n\n### Comment ID lnuipzs with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuipzs/) (in reply to ID lnugpd7):\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o180is0uwopd1.jpeg?width=449&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=279ade612825bc2c8c3b510b8ac522207084671b\n\n## Comment ID lnu8o1l with +11 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnu8o1l/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nYes it is.\n\nCome on all roles are important but the fact that a Jungler can guarantee you a lord and turtles is what it makes challenging and important \n\nAnd yes Roaming IS the easiest role for me\n\nYou can say roamers die protecting their teammates, but that is uncommon, mostly after a gank or set roamers survive, with low health but they do\n\nRoamer is least likely to be killed \n\nSurvival is the easy part\n\nBut to use their skills to set up cc and change the game is really difficult\n\n### Comment ID lnuaewf with +5 score by [(MiloCAD, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuaewf/) (in reply to ID lnu8o1l):\nYes, perhaps roamer is easier, but finding a decent roamer is like finding a needle in a haystack.\n\n#### Comment ID lnuakg1 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuakg1/) (in reply to ID lnuaewf):\nOf course\n\n### Comment ID lnuhwl3 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuhwl3/) (in reply to ID lnu8o1l):\nhaha, by reading this I know you don't roam that often.\n\n### Comment ID lnuynfk with +1 score by [(Rgamingchill, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuynfk/) (in reply to ID lnu8o1l):\nI'm both a good Jungler and a good roamer.

If the mm hiding behind the tank is pierced through the tank, it's the tank's fault. If your Jungler is bonkers in the head you have to do his part of ganking too. \n\nOn the other side, junglers can hide under the excuse they were farming or that the ganking of a lane isn't I  their rotation. If the roamer babysits a lane, it's a Jungler's job to gank the other.

Imo, yes for most matches in normal ranked games, junglers need to manage farming, ganking, dictation of teamfights and securing neutral objectives, all the while dealing with random variables like whether the mage and roam is on point and helping to defend against jungle invasions/providing vision etc, and also needing to read the flow of your laners, to provide extra assistance and attention if your laners are particularly weak to their counterparts either by drafting compatibility or skill gap.\n\nRoamers on the other hand, simply need to provide vision, stuns and/or support, defend against or support jungle invasions, and frontlining in teamfights but majority of roam players cant do that even decently, while always looking to blame someone for problems of their own making (usual targets for verbal abuse being MM and Jungler). Proper roamers also do not need to farm, so that takes a load of pressure off their shoulders (not considering assassins mainly as assassin roamers are pretty gimmicky, and usually work out lesser the higher the elo, not to mention that it usually attracts players with terrible roamer competencies even if they are good at the hero). Also roam hero mechanics are amongst the easiest while jungler heroes tend to be more dificult relatively on average, so its pretty difficult to argue in any dimension that roaming is harder than jungling in usual circumstances.\n\nHowever, thats a little different in the pro scene, because most pro players are near the very limits of their effective capacity and rarely makes any fundamental mistakes in their roles. Rather teamfights are the nexus event that determines whether the game is won or lost, and roamers have a outsized role when it comes to teamfight initialisation, frontlining or disrupting the enemy's flow by clouding their judgement and forcing them to use skills at the wrong time. Kills are also rarely secured 1v1 in that level due to the high competency of everyone on that level, which means any kill from another person at least involves the mage or jungler, but probably the roamer, so roamers play incredibly important roles in the pro scene, serving as the difference makers. That doesnt apply to most people on this subreddit however, even MI wouldnt be close to the pro scene standard.\n\n## Comment ID lnuj1m3 with +1 score by [(Present-Difficulty-6, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuj1m3/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nThere’s a reason why Roams are the usual captains/shotcaller of the team.\n\n### Comment ID lnv19pp with +1 score by [(Tenmashiki, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnv19pp/) (in reply to ID lnuj1m3):\nThey are the shotcallers because it is not as micro intensive, allowing them to focus their attention on the overall flow and macro and make decisions from there.\n\n#### Comment ID lnvbl3s with +1 score by [(Present-Difficulty-6, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnvbl3s/) (in reply to ID lnv19pp):\nExactly why I think Junglers are harder to play..

A good Jungler with a bad roamer can't win a game by themselves against half-decent players. I've seen that firsthand in my games, either me or a team mate was Jungling and the roamer was awful, or in the enemy team where they had a great jungler and a God awful roamer. The jungler has higher expectations on their shoulders, but they need a roamer to pull them off. You can steal infinitely many objectives if you are good with retri, a bad roamer will make all of that useless. \n\nFurthermore, if a Jungler is bad, what they fail to do falls on the roamer. If a jungler wastes Retribution, it's the roamer who is expected to delay or halt the enemy team from taking the objectives while the cooldown is on. A roamer can often salvage something from a Jungler's mistake, which isn't true the other way around. \n\nLet me put it this way. Roaming is easy to learn, hard to master, while Jungling is hard to learn, but easy to master. As such, In the middle Point of the learning curve, Roaming definitely feels(and is) harder. That is, of course, not the case if the roamer in question is not a setter tank.\n\n## Comment ID lnv0sdv with +1 score by [(TerracottaaBanana, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnv0sdv/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nNeither they both are equally hard the roamer have the utility to be useful in the game no matter what stage they are in and jungler have DPS  to be useful in the game no matter what stage but they gotta to see care of objectives while roamer take care of other imo they both basically support each other as a role (I play both roam and jungle) I always ask for my roam to babysit me or I babysit my jungler until 5 minute and feed him roamer and jungle are the same role with different objective if you really think about it too they both roam they both support teammate while jungle put Damage on the table, Tank put utility so they are equally hard but if I have to choose I would say roam because they can't solo carry like jungle\n\n## Comment ID lnv3cjw with +1 score by [(LandscapeFeisty951, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnv3cjw/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nAs a roamer I think jungler is harder.

I haven't found anything quite as good as RDR2 for immersive free roaming. Titles I have enjoyed in no particular order are:\n\nWitcher 3: a little less focused on interactive free roam world but definitely lots to explore.\n\nGhost of Tsushima: again less interactive free roam but a fantastic experience (I actually preferred it over RDR2).\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn: definitely a fun game to go exploring in. I loved this despite it being a setting I traditionally don't enjoy.\n\nFar Cry 5: first person shooter with an interesting world to explore. It has many flaws, imo, but can be fun to wander about. The fishing is, imo, better than RDR2.\n\nGhost Recon Wildlands: suggesting this over the newer Breakpoint as it has a better world with the possibility of creating more intense situations.\n\nWatch Dogs 2: all three games are on ps4 but 2 in my opinion has the best map for exploration and the most potential to create interesting situations.\n\n## Comment ID h6s73ef with +13 score by [(DarkIxis, Reddit, 2021-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/h6s73ef/) (in reply to ID oszpl5):\nDays Gone is the sandbox I'm trudging through, good mechanics, decent story, and lots of exploring.

You appreciate the wildlife, the trees, the weather, the landscape and the music a lot more when you're not blazing past it at 100mph. \n\nBut that's the downside: most game companies are about providing intense action at all times. Very few games want to give the player a slow moment because those are moments that a player is likely to stop playing in. Even comparing RDR1 to RDR2 illustrates this as RDR1, fantastic as it is, plays more like a _video game_ than a _simulation_, which is the core difference in my eyes\n\n### Comment ID gsbh2i9 with +9 score by [(LexB777, Reddit, 2021-03-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbh2i9/) (in reply to ID gsb7qjk):\nReally interesting point. I had considered the slow pacing, but not the fact that you actually move and do things slower.\n\nWhen I first started the game, I found the pacing made me antsy. I kept wanting to go faster, but I *knew* that I would fall in love with this game. I played the ever living shit out of RDR1, over and over again. Same with GTA5 and Skyrim. I'm the kind of player that buys about 1 or 2 games per year.\n\nNow that I'm in the last Chapter of the whole game, I wish I had taken it even slower (even though I have 180 hours logged into the first save, not sure if that's normal but it feels like a lot). I definitely will go even slower on my second play through.\n\n#### Comment ID gsbhj5p with +4 score by [(Joss_Card, Reddit, 2021-03-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbhj5p/) (in reply to ID gsbh2i9):\nThat's what I did.

One that, like yours, stays on a charger in the bathroom and goes in the shower with me, and I take on the road or in my carry-on for trips. I use it every morning getting ready, and every afternoon taking a shower. Probably my most used Sonos device. The other has lived on my back patio for nearly 2 years.

      "# Post ID 1amz7sx: Recommendations for games like Genshin. (Single player; free roam; exploration with puzzles) with +5 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/)\nHi,\n\nDo you have any recommendations for games like Genshin Impact. I mean: single player mainly; free roaming open-world and exploration with puzzles.\n\nFrom what I know:\n\n\"Zelda Breath of the Wild\" and \"Tears of Kingdom\"\n\nImmortal Fenyx Rising\n\nWuthering Waves (not yet released but I still count it)\n\n* What I do **NOT** look for:\n\nGames mainly focused on multiplayer (example: Tower of Fantasy) (I have a bad connection, so my ping is quite bad. It's still okay when Internet is only a bit required like Genshin, but once other players are involved, I often have a lag of a few seconds)\n\nNon free-roaming games (example: Honkai Star Rail) (The puzzles often make me feel like I found a rubik's cube on the side of the road instead of the puzzle being hidden and part of the world. What I am looking for is to explore, find secrets and be rewarded for solving them; all that in a fluid way, instead of the puzzle interrupting my freedom of movement).\n\n* What make no difference for me:\n\nCombat: Combats can be action or turned based\n\nClimbing: There can be no climbing. It can even be no jumping. As long as the environment allow falling from edges to find secret (think Dark Souls. No real jumping, but you can find a lot of secrets anyway\n\nDoes anyone know of games like that?\n\nEdit: For more precision: What I am looking for is environmental puzzle; puzzle where you still control your character to solve the puzzle. Not puzzle that feels more like a minigame totally separated from the main gameplay.\n\nAnd the feeling I am looking for is: you explore the world, find a puzzle out in the wild. You try to solve it; if you can't solve it, no problem, you can just return to it later. The other puzzles aren't locked because you didn't complete the previous ones; while at the same time you find puzzles through exploring, it's not a serie of room with puzzle in each of them.\n\n## Comment ID kpphbg1 with +6 score by [(Due-Distribution-463, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpphbg1/) (in reply to ID 1amz7sx):\nFallout 4 and Skyrim are the best open world games although both are graphically out of date. There are no real puzzles in either of them which is a big plus in my book. Puzzles are too artificial.\n\nSubnautuca is a great open world game but it has no real combat or NPCs to interact with.\n\nHogwarts Legacy is similar to Genshin.\n\n### Comment ID kpqejsw with +7 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpqejsw/) (in reply to ID kpphbg1):\nExcept, I am looking for the puzzles.

Wow, I never thought about it, but *yeah*, the Tallnecks ARE puzzles, where you have to observe the terrain and the machines guarding it, then approach carefully. \n\nMany fights are also puzzles, as (unless you play on the lightest difficulty) it's best to start stealthy and go noisy only when you're not going to get attacked from four different directions. Stealth games are IMHO partly puzzle games where you're trying to solve how to move from point A to point B with a minimum of fuss. \n\nThe sequel has a LOT more puzzles, some of which I remember very fondly; climbing up a pair of overgrown skyscrapers in San Francisco or delving a ruin in the remains of Las Vegas.\n\n#### Comment ID kptrxtg with +1 score by [(Toutanus, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kptrxtg/) (in reply to ID kpphrd1):\nForbiden West has more puzzles\n\n## Comment ID kppgsqd with +4 score by [(Mar_ZP, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kppgsqd/) (in reply to ID 1amz7sx):\nI'm not sure it matches your description but I'll throw it anyways...

Oblivion and Morrowind, too.  Elex is essentially a double-A version of this, if you're really desperate. \n\n\nA bunch of open world jrpgs would match your criteria, too. Try xenoblade, modern final fantasy, etc. \n\n\nDark souls is even heavier on combat and lighter on puzzles than skyrim, but some are free roam. Elden ring is similar, but with much more free roam than dark souls. \n\n\nFallout and starfield could be stretched to meet your criteria. Puzzles are almost non existent tho. \n\n\nAt this point, you're running out of games. Nier and Nier Automata are less free roam than you'd like, and have no focus on puzzles.\n\n### Comment ID kpvoi0q with +3 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpvoi0q/) (in reply to ID kpqiicx):\nI am looking for these puzzles. I am looking for the type of games where you explore, then suddenly, a wild puzzle appears. If you can't solve it, you just return to it later. But the puzzle is environmental, you are still in controls of your characters. A lot of JRPG have the \"rubik's sube\" feeling: you no longer control you character, and instead control the puzzle. It's often because map movement/interaction is limited.\n\nOne of the rare exception for JRPG, is Golden Sun.

Great memories of sword only and that one bow challenge in the inazuma quest where java spent days to get around it. \n\nOfc without an audience you don't have that much of an incentive to not cheat if you're stuck but you can give you hard penalties, e.g. 1 cheat costs a 10pull on the standard banner or something like that. \n\nBut that's just if you're reeeeaaally into a challenge, otherwise it'll likely burn you out\n\n### Comment ID kpvi8lg with +2 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpvi8lg/) (in reply to ID kpr0ifs):\nI am more looking at something casual.

It's not totally open world but there are several expansive areas that you can go to find stars. There are little guys you need to fight off, but no character building. There are a ton of puzzles that you can play and ditch if you want to work on other puzzles (all give you stars so that you can fight the boss and move to the next area). It's 1-2 player, more fun with a friend to play as his hat lol.\n\nI was OBSESSED with this game and I felt the same level of obsession when I started playing Genshin. I feel the same way as you and am desperately searching for something similar to Genshin with open world, character building, ideally single player, and with lots of puzzles. \n\nI saw some people talking about Outer Wilds. It has great reviews so I'm thinking about buying, but please let me know if you have tried it out yet. I'm considering buying the Zelda breath of the wild games but I prefer to use my PC than Switch bc the playstyle is easier to me.\n\nAlso, have you played Stardew Valley?

Multiplayer wasn't internet, unfortunately, and I think the game might have been old enough to have IPX as an option lol.\n\nAbsolutely my favorite campaign mode of any jet sim ever, unmatched to this day. \n\nInterestingly, the whole premise of the sim was that you could fly either the X32 or X35 (yes, this sim came out *before Lockheed won the contract* ) to compare the two, theoretically.

Every time I have to do this it ends up being a frustrating trial and error process. Controls are not intuitive. I would say any product that requires “press and hold” type of operation to accomplish common tasks is just bad. I’ve owned a Roam for since day one. I travel with it between two Sonos households. Plus using it on the road. Each time I have to move it, I dread the process.\n\n## Comment ID ibypiie with +19 score by [(thechavo, Reddit, 2022-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/v9vdqz/i_will_just_say_it_roam_is_a_terrible_user/ibypiie/) (in reply to ID v9vdqz):\nSonos please add a voice bluetooth/wifi command!\n\n## Comment ID ibypqpx with +51 score by [(2Dmonster, Reddit, 2022-06-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/v9vdqz/i_will_just_say_it_roam_is_a_terrible_user/ibypqpx/) (in reply to ID v9vdqz):\nI would just prefer a hard switch between bluetooth and wifi.

There may be issues moving it between different Sonos networks but that is such a tiny use case I don't think it qualifies as a valid complaint. That's not even a feature I'd expect. Why would Sonos want you to move that speaker rather than buy two Roams? \n\nThis thing has been a game changer for me. At home it's a portable extension of my Sonos network. On the go it sounds great is super light and has a more than serviceable battery. And it was the best way to add Bluetooth connectivity to my whole system.

      "# [A Weekend Guide To Scarborough And The Yorkshire Coast Of England — ROAM WHERE by Rachel Boyles on 2023-03-08](https://www.roamwhere.com/blog/a-weekend-in-scarborough-the-yorkshire-coast-of-england)\nWhy Visit Scarborough And The English Coast\n\nFish and chips. Ice cream. 2 penny slots. Coastal hikes. Lighthouses. Just a few of my favorite things every time we go to the seaside.\n\nWhen I told a few friends from London that I was going to Scarborough for the first few days of the New Year they asked why there. The question caught me off guard, but then it reminded me that just because my family is familiar with an area doesn't mean others are. England has 7,000 miles of coastline, so every region in the country will have the seaside town they're closest to or most likely to visit. Scarborough and the surrounding northeast coast is where my husband's family spends most of their seaside time because the area is quaint, nature-filled, and only a few hour’s drive.\n\nIf you're visiting England for a week, it's easy to have a full itinerary, but time by the sea is special and gives you a glimpse into English seaside culture. From super cute, charming towns with fish and chips and antique shops to long swaths of beach and coastline to hike up and down, it would be a miss not to visit. This post specifically focuses on Scarborough and the surrounding Yorkshire area, but don't let that limit you! If you only have a short amount of time, seek out the coast closest to you and use this post for inspiration of things you can do, because many of these activities aren't unique to Scarborough. That said if you fall in love with the views in the photos, and you have the time, Scarborough is one hundred percent worth your time.\n\nThis post includes affiliate links.

Learn more about this on my privacy policy.\n\nWhen To Visit The English Seaside\n\nOf course, summer is the most popular time because you have a chance at warmer temperatures for sunbathing and maybe even a brave chilly swim, but any time of the year can be a good time to visit. Most times we've visited the seaside have been solely chosen because we've visited family. And more often than not, we're visiting for the holidays in the winter, so I've had my fair share of winter seaside days. No matter the weather, whether it's rainy and cold or sunny and breezy, I've enjoyed every visit.\n\nThis most recent seaside escape took us to Scarborough. Every time I visit my husband's family, they always try to take me somewhere new to me but familiar to them. In past visits, we made it to Whitby, Robin Hood's Bay, and Staithes, and somehow I hadn't made my way to Scarborough yet. Since we were looking for a base for a few day’s visit versus just a day trip, it was the perfect option with lots to do. We visited the first few days of the new year with the hopes of \"clearing out the cobwebs\" (as my father-in-law likes to say) with fresh sea air and nature views.\n\nExplore The Harbor And Seafront\n\nWe spent most of our time in Scarborough walking along the seafront of the South Harbor. It's the main location for restaurants, games to play, and beach walks. On our first day, we started at the St. Mary's carpark and walked the half-mile path past the Scarborough castle and down to South Beach Bay. You get a good view of the sea and the town while also admiring the castle walls. Once at the Bay, we walked down the boardwalk along the beach and then came back along the other side of the road to look over the shops and restaurants.\n\nWe visited over the winter holidays, and it was a bright sunny day, so the beach was packed with people. We realized we weren't the only ones who thought being by the water would be a great way to start the New Year. Even with the masses, I was still enthralled with it. There is just something so uniquely distinctive about UK seaside culture, and Scarborough has it all. Full families walking along the waterfront together, everyone with either fish and chips or ice cream, bundled up in coats and hats, all in front of a backdrop of bright signs, tourist shops, and the waves crashing in the distance.\n\nOn each of the two nights we stayed in Scarborough, we also came down to walk along the harbor. The harbor front is also home to many 'casinos'(?) with 2p slots (more on that below), so that was also our evening entertainment.\n\nAll of this to say, it's the thing to do in the place. Just go for a walk and observe at the very least.\n\nPlay 2p Slots\n\nI can't write this post without talking about 2p slots. If you're from the UK, you most likely don't need an explanation. But as an American, I find them unique, almost perplexing, but also incredibly fun and addictive. Basically, they have games that cost a 2 penny coin to play. For most machines, as you and others play, the 2p coins pile up in the machine. The goal is to knock a jackpot worth of coins or some small trinket into a hole below so you can collect it. A jackpot worth of coins is what I always dream of, but I'm not sure if anyone has won more than £1 (= 50 x 2p coins) in one go from these games. And the trinkets are usually things like little animal figurines or whatever the new cheap trendy toy is. (This time the toy in fashion was the push pop keychains, but I could imagine a past where Tamagotchis were on offer.)\n\n2p slot 'casinos' offer a lot of fun for £1. You can search for the machine that looks the most primed, try out what you think is the perfect angle that will win them all, and even attempt different techniques like pushing in a lot of coins all at once or doing them one at a time. Each time we would win a trinket, we would comment on how if we bought it ourselves it would be much cheaper than what we spent winning it, but it's the journey, not the destination.\n\nWhat makes these so peculiar to me is that they're basically lightweight gambling. I felt myself thinking if I just play one more pound I'll crack this machine and get a windfall, but as I said, I'm not sure if that ever happens. But that 1% of hope keeps me coming back and trying again. Even worse, the real deal slot machines are just beyond an 18 or older line on the ground. Signaling once you're old enough, you can play for bigger money.\n\nAnyways, they're (or at least can be) cheap fun and signify a day at the seaside. Enjoy yourself but go in with a budget of £5 or so and keep your wits about you.\n\nGet Fish And Chips\n\nWhere To Walk And Hike / What To Do / What To See In The Area Around Scarborough\n\nThis section wasn't easy to title, because visiting the seaside is often a ‘choose your own adventure’. Looking to walk through a quaint coastal village? They have that. What about a rugged coastline with lots of hiking paths? They have that too. Or what about a wooded hike inland? Yup, there's also that. At each of these places, you can take it at your own pace and explore it the way you want to best.\n\nVisit Flamborough Head\n\nI was blown away by this place. I don't know if it was because I had experienced withdrawals from not traveling and exploring somewhere new, or if really it is that impressive, but I thought it was beautiful. Ultimately, I didn't know what to expect, but it's like a smaller version of the White Cliffs of Dover. In other seaside visits, usually, we're in the harbor so I don't see the rugged coastline as much, so I think that's why this surprised me so much.\n\nIt has easy and ample parking up by the lighthouse. From there, you can hike down to the water and walk around the base of the chalk cliffs and along the rocky beach as you explore the cavernous areas. You can also walk along the top of the cliffs and look at the rolling green meadows ahead and the water crashing below. Even better, we came upon a bay full of seals. We were looking down at them from above, but it was fun to stumble upon them. I also JUST read while working on this post that you can spot puffins from mid-May to July. I might have to return just for that!\n\nA quick disclaimer on tide times\n\nWhen visiting the coast, it's important to keep an eye on the tidal schedule, because, in most locations, the beach is completely covered by a few feet of water during high tide.\n\nA tidal win: We visited Flamborough Head at the perfect time because we were able to explore a large part of the beach and even explore more corners of it by walking around rocks. Not even 30 minutes after we were there, the path around the rocks had waves covering the path. And an hour or two later, the beach would not have been accessible.\n\nA tidal loss: We planned to visit Filey on our way back to Scarborough from Flamborough Head. It made sense logistically, but we didn't watch the tidal schedule. We parked where the family normally parks, which gives you a nice walk along the water into town. Well, we walk down to the beach and end up seeing the water coming all of the way into one of the areas that juts out before we get onto the beach. We contemplated and watched others make attempts. A family on their walk back from town filled their boots with water and a woman got muddy climbing up and over. So we decided against it and went the longer route up and around.\n\nFalling Foss / Foss Falls\n\nThis destination takes you inland, so it's a nice contrast to all of the time near the water. Because it's off the beaten path, it's definitely an adventure. We chose it based on a recommendation from my sister-in-law who had hiked it before. When she came the first time, the path she took was challenging, so this time we searched out a slightly easier path. Slightly is the keyword here, but no matter the difficulty level, it made for a fun family bonding experience. Most of us got mud on us some way or another.\n\nWe started the path by looking down at the waterfall from above, and then we took the long path walking away from the falls for quite a while. We started to zig zag our way back and down to the floor of the waterfall. At the point we reached the stream, we could hear the waterfall but we couldn't see it. This is where things got a little confusing. We tried crossing over the stream and then walking along it, but the path took us away from the falls again. So we scrambled our way back down to the stream, off trail, and then had to find an area of stones or a fallen tree to cross back over. All of that to say we had a fantastic time, spent the afternoon out in the forest, and overcame many hurdles we thought would stop us along the way. The falls are beautiful, and I bet it's fun to take a swim when it's warm in the summer.\n\nThese next three destinations I've visited on other trips to the UK, but they're nearby Scarborough and so worth exploring:\n\nRobin Hoods Bay\n\nSpeaking of quaint villages, this is definitely one, if you can't tell by the name. It's built into the fissure of two hills with winding cobble stone alleyways and sandstone houses. It's a fun walk down to the sea and then you can explore along the beach. We went here a few years back, but it was my first time seeing this coast, and this particular area really stuck in my heart and mind.\n\nWhitby\n\nOne of the more famous stops along the coast, Whitby is known for the remains of the once-large Whitby Abbey as well as the home to Bram Stoker while he wrote Dracula. Whitby has a decent size city center with lots of shops and restaurants to explore. It's very picturesque because it's split by the River Esk which flows into the North Sea, and on either side of the bridge you get a great view of the city, full of brick and stone buildings with their red roofs. This is a fantastic place to stop for fish and chips. We usually get ours at Mister Chips by the beach and eat it outside at the gazebo. As a reminder, keep an eye out for seagulls (they will swoop down and take a whole tray of chips from you). My other favorite stop in Whitby is to get a cup of tea from the tea stall. You can get it in a real mug while you observe the city across the water. Super cute and very English.\n\nStaithes\n\nA much smaller village to visit, in my mind I think of it similar to Robin Hood's Bay. When we visited, we walked through town, by the bay, and along the breakwater. It has lovely views of cliffs that create a nice sheltered harbor that contributed to it becoming a village.\n\nWhere To Eat In Scarborough",

      "# [Wahoo ACE Cycling GPS In-Depth Review: The Best or Unbaked? by Ray Maker on 2024-12-03](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/12/wahoo-elemnt-ace-in-depth-review-bike-computer.html)\nAfter years of waiting, we’ve finally got a new Wahoo cycling GPS – and it’s a beast. At least, in terms of size and weight. And in the future, Wahoo also hopes in terms of features and position in the market. The new unit sports a full color touchscreen display, roughly similar to that of cell phones, while also including a speaker, bike-bell, and wind sensor. Of course, like other high-end bike computers introduced this year, it also includes a much higher price tag – $599USD.\n\nUnfortunately, to spoil this review – it’s half-baked. It’s missing a vast array of features that previously existed on every other Wahoo bike computer to date, it’s even missing features listed on the front of the box and marketing site, and the battery life falls far short of claims. I’d argue this is the perfect product to see which reviewers are actually riding with it, versus just taking pretty shots of it.\n\nBut, we’re getting ahead of ourselves here. I’ve been riding the crap out of it, everything from near-daily 3-4 hour rides, to mountain biking, structured workouts, gravel riding, and more. All with the goal of figuring out what actually works.\n\nFinally, note that this unit is a media loaner, and once this review is complete, it will go back to Wahoo. As always, I don’t accept advertising from any company I review – so, if you found this review useful, consider becoming a DCR Supporter, which gets you an ad-free site, plus the behind-the-scenes video series between both myself (and my wife) on everything that happens in the DCR Sports Tech Cave/universe.\n\nHow it Differs:\n\nIn some ways, it’s hard to compare a watermelon to a kiwi, as that’s roughly what it’s like comparing the Wahoo ACE to a Wahoo ROAM. So yes, while both are fruit (bike computers), beyond that, they are actually quite a bit different – both good and bad. Still, assuming the standard Wahoo bike computer as a baseline (which is a massive assumption as you’ll see), here are the most notable differences:\n\n– Increased size of unit a cargo-ship-sized boatload\n\n– Increased screen size to 3.8” (2.7” on ROAM V2)\n\n– Increased screen colors to 16 million (64 colors on ROAM V2)\n\n– Added touchscreen capability\n\n– Added a very loud bike bell (digital)\n\n– Added voice navigation prompts\n\n– Added wind sensor\n\n– Added new sensor pairing dashboard\n\n– Added map layers option\n\n– Added street names on maps to (some) streets\n\n– Added Activity Profiles (e.g., Road/MTB/etc…)\n\n– Added time to upper edge, and always-on/seen\n\n– Revamped ‘Ready to Ride’ dashboard\n\n– Changed to Wahoo App (from Wahoo ELEMNT App)\n\n– Changed a ton of the user interface\n\n– No more lights/LEDs along upper edge\n\n– No Live Tracking yet (firmware update in H1 2025)\n\n– No Strava Live Segments yet (firmware update in H1 2025)\n\n– No more full-route elevation view (coming in TBD update)\n\n– No more filtering of routes on device (coming in TBD update)\n\n– No more naming of saved locations (coming in TBD update)\n\n– No more custom alerts (e.g., hydration/nutrition alerts, coming in update)\n\n– No more choosing location on Wahoo App map to route to (only device)\n\n– No more changing gear ratios (electronic shifting) in new Wahoo app\n\n– No nacho cheese dispenser\n\n– No TrainerRoad Outside Workouts at present (‘coming soon’)\n\n– Increased battery life claim to 30 hours (Note: This isn’t even vaguely close to real, as I’ll show)\n\n– Increased internal storage from 32GB to 64GB (for maps)\n\n– Included new aluminum mount (versus plastic previously)\n\n– Removed screw for bike computer to mount (allowed UCI Pro teams to count unit weight as bike weight)\n\n– Price is $599USD/$849CAD/€599EUR/£549GBP/$999AUD/¥99,000JPY\n\nNow, when it comes to features that are in the pipeline, Wahoo has confirmed some of them, per the table below, though, many of the ones listed above don’t have exact dates yet.\n\nThe first set is these updates not in the 2025 table:\n\n“Planned December 2024 Updates. A post launch update will take place in December. This update will include the following features below:\n\n– Strava Live Segments\n\n– Offline configuration support (to supplement cloud based architecture)\n\n– “Workout Profiles” rebrand to “Activity Profiles”\n\n– Additional UI/UX Refinement and bug fixes”\n\nAnd then the second category is this, for H1 2025 and H2 2025.\n\nFor example, language support includes focusing on French, German, Spanish, and then the remaining 14 languages Wahoo currently supports. Today, it’s only English on the ACE. For advanced route management, that’s allowing you to ride routes on a trainer, while showing the virtual route location on your map on the ACE.\n\nIn the case of the battery optimizations, they’re aiming to strike a better balance between the 5-second timeout mode, and the Auto mode, basically in hopes of getting the battery life better within Auto, versus the only way to get good battery life today is 5-second mode (more on that later).\n\nFor H2, they’re looking at additional map layers such as custom POIs from Strava or Komoot, as well as some functions around the wind sensor, including breaking out how much power is required to overcome the grade (on a climb, steep or otherwise) vs wind (which might help on positioning). These are all certainly interesting ideas. Though, I fear some of these aspirations could become derailed with trying to get all the existing features ported first, before they can focus on new items.\n\nSo with that, let’s get into the box.\n\nIn the Box:\n\nFirst up we’ll quickly get the unit unboxed. Inside, you’ll find the ACE just chilling:\n\nBut here’s what’s inside the box once you get rid of all the paper. Kudos to Wahoo in that there’s no plastic in the box.\n\nInside you’ve got:\n\n– The beefcake of a bike computer (ACE)\n\n– The beefcake of a metal mount\n\n– The lanyard to tether the ACE in case it snaps the mount\n\n– The USB-C cable to charge it\n\n– A warranty paper you’ll never read.\n\nHere’s a few close-up shots of all those things.\n\nOk, let’s get into the size. Or, over the size. Or, wrap ourselves around the size.\n\nThe Size:\n\nLike it or not, the size is going to be a polarizing aspect of the Wahoo ACE. And it’s near impossible to understand in photos. It’s not really due to any singular dimension, but rather, the complete girthiness of it. It’s a tank in all ways.\n\nOfficially it measures 208g on the scale, but it’s mostly the thickness and width you’ll notice. Here’s how it looks side-by-side:\n\nThe thing is, I’m a unique duck here. I’m used to all assortment of stupid-large things on my handlebars for testing, including drone remote controls and more. So frankly, the size actually doesn’t bother me. Neither does the weight.\n\nHowever, it’s impossible not to notice it. It’s huge. Wahoo says much of the size is to account for the larger battery, which in turn provides it with a claimed 30 hours of battery life (a number I can’t get *anywhere near* in my testing).\n\nWhen it comes to mounts, it has much the same problem as the Edge 1050 did at launch – it needs an XL mount of some sort. In Wahoo’s case though, that’s actually twofold. First, it needs a strong (realistically metal) mount to support the much heavier weight. Very heavy, so heavy in fact that Wahoo is specifically not designing a GoPro adapter for the bottom of their mount because the combined weight will likely snap it (after hitting a pothole or cobbles).\n\nHere’s their stock mount on my mountain bike:\n\nThe second piece is the length. It needs to be long enough to handle that, which is longer than the Edge 1050, but because the mount is centered differently than the Edge 1050, it can squeeze into most Edge 1050 compatible mounts. But barely. In the case of my Canyon bike with the stock Canyon out-front mounts, it basically skids (physically touches) across the handlebar as I rotate inwards:\n\nBut it does get in there, after snuggling. And that particular mount is designed to support a light on the bottom, so it’s used to the weight. Though, I haven’t tried it with both Wahoo ACE + Light to see if it’ll snap. Here’s to hoping it doesn’t.\n\nThe point is, this will be frustrating for some users (actually, many users) who want to mount a GoPro or other action camera below. The combined weight is simply well beyond what any mount on the market today is going to safely handle (I’ve snapped metal mounts with far less weight on them). Hopefully we’ll see some viable Ace+GoPro mounts soon. After all, Wahoo does have GoPro action cam control on the unit.\n\nRiding Basics:\n\nProbably the first thing you’ll need to know is now you’ll be using Wahoo’s new bike computer app on your smartphone, simply called ‘Wahoo’. Previously with their bike computers, you used the Wahoo ELEMNT app. But over the last year or two, Wahoo’s been slowly moving devices under the consolidated Wahoo App instead. At a high level, this works. But if you’re a long-time Wahoo user, you’ll quickly find the gaps for which there are no solutions.\n\nWithin the Wahoo app, you’ll pair up the Wahoo ACE, as well as link any partner accounts you have, like Strava, TrainingPeaks, or Komoot. However, the list is a bit messy right now. A number of the existing Wahoo partners aren’t working in the new Wahoo app/platform, which is required for the ACE.\n\nFurther, one thing that’s rather silly, is that by default, it won’t automatically upload your completed activities to each of these platforms. You have to expand out the box and check ‘Auto-Share’. Why?!? So much why.\n\nWithin the Wahoo app, you can set up heart rate zone, and power zones (plus bits like metric/imperial/custom display of measurements).\n\nNext, this is the first Wahoo cycling computer to support sport/bike profiles, such as creating a set of data pages for road cycling, and a different one for mountain biking. To do so, you’ll open the Wahoo app, and then select to ‘Add Workout Profile’. Here you’ll choose something within the ‘Cycling’ category, in order to get it to show up on the ACE:\n\nHere I’ve created a Mountain Biking profile, where I can then configure workout pages, alerts, general settings (such as Auto Lap), as well as heart rate zones:\n\nWhen it comes to workout data pages, there’s a boatload of options as before, both in terms of custom data fields, as well as dedicated pages like Music Control, GoPro Control, and Strava Live Segments (when that feature gets rolled out in a few months).\n\nAnd, because someone in the comments section got really angry that I didn’t show how many data fields the map page can display, here ya go, all the data fields – including the elevation data field at the bottom, and wind on the side.\n\nOnce you’ve got all that configured, you can then select it at the top of your ACE:\n\nAfter which, all of your data pages/settings/etc will be available for that ride.\n\nBut here’s the (extremely annoying) rub: This won’t correctly tag the ride type on Strava or other platforms upon upload. The *singular* feature that people have been asking for, for countless years, Wahoo hasn’t completed. Thus everything is listed on Strava as a generic ride, unless you go on Strava and manually toggle it to Mountain Bike, Gravel, etc…\n\nWahoo says that adding in the correct sub-type is on their near-term radar, but they don’t have a timeframe for it. Keeping in mind, this is literally just a single field in the .FIT file they have to set.\n\nNow, one of the things you’ll notice is the new sensor pairing menu at the bottom. This shows your paired sensors, and whether or not they’re connected. It even has nifty-proper icons for each of them.\n\nIn fact, kudos to Wahoo here. Not only did they make picture-perfect icons for all their own devices (e.g. Wahoo POWRLINK Zero power meter pedals look like Wahoo speedplay pedals), but they also did it for at least some other power meters. For example, the Garmin Rally pedals look roughly like Garmin Rally pedals. Quarq cranksets and Favero power pedals just look like generic crank arms. Still, well done Wahoo.\n\nWhen it comes to shifting, you can pair up both ANT+ Shifting (e.g. SRAM eTAP/AXS) as well as Shimano Di2. In the case of both, you can use the remote shifter buttons to change data pages or set a lap marker. However, at present the new Wahoo App doesn’t support customizing gear ratios like the Wahoo ELEMNT app did.\n\nNow, that said, I will note that it seems to take a little longer than I’d like to find sensors sometimes. Not a huge deal, but it’s not quite as instant as Wahoo’s other devices or Garmin/Hammerhead. Sometimes it’s more like 20-30 seconds before it seems to notice its sensor friends are awake.\n\nStill, once it finds it, I’ve had zero issues on all my rides across numerous bikes, including: SRAM AXS RED XPLR (and FORCE AXS), Shimano Di2, Quarq power meters, Favero Assioma MX power meter, Garmin Rally power meter, Wahoo TRACKR heart rate sensor, Garmin HRM-PRO Plus HR sensor, and Garmin Varia RTL-515 radar.\n\nSo with all that configured, let’s go and ride. Again, I’ll cover navigation later on. As you ride, you’ll see your data pages automatically displayed. You can swipe through them using your fingers, or press the page button:\n\nYou’ll notice above the coloring for my heart rate and wattage, this is based on my zones. It’s a nice touch that Wahoo has, and also appears in other fields, like gradient.\n\nWahoo also has the concept of increasing/decreasing data field quantities. Meaning, by simply pressing the up/down buttons (on the right side), it’ll change how many data fields are displayed on the page, per the priority you set on the app. As you do this, it’ll change how big each field is. Such as below:\n\nNote that while Wahoo got rid of the LED bar seen on past Wahoo computers, it does retain much of that same concept through colorized data fields and a strip that updates at the top of the screen. Further, I appreciate always having the time displayed at the top of the screen, no matter what data page you’re on. They also use that area to display upcoming turns (albeit, kinda late usually).\n\nNext, regardless of whether you have a route enabled or not, you’ll automatically get upcoming climb information. As you approach a climb, it’ll automatically trigger and show you details of that upcoming climb, such as this:\n\nYou’ll see details about the gradient displayed within the color of the chevrons on the map. You can tap through a few different data pages that show details about the climb.\n\nNext, you can execute structured workouts from Wahoo’s own app, or TrainingPeaks. At present, TrainerRoad is not yet supported. As part of the migration to the Wahoo App, these connections haven’t been completed yet. And others are missing as well. TrainerRoad says that’s coming soon.\n\nIn any case, you can open up the structured workout on the workouts page to see a list of scheduled workouts. In my case, I manually created one in TrainingPeaks, since my TrainerRoad ones weren’t coming through anymore.\n\nAs you execute it, you’ll see details about each step automatically, and alerts accordingly…sometimes. You see, there’s a ton of bugs here.\n\n– Skipped showing the progress bar during the warmup\n\n– Didn’t show any interval alerts if I wasn’t on the interval page (so if I was on another data page, zero notification of the start of an interval) [Update: It apparently does, except that option is now hidden deep in a menu setting, and set for default off. Why? WHY?!?!]\n\n– Didn’t adhere to TrainingPeaks ‘pause till lap’ option\n\n– Didn’t show my current power line, as Wahoo’s own marketing site says it should\n\nI do like the little pop-over at the bottom, but again, it only shows on the workout page, which kinda defeats the point of a popover.\n\nAnd here’s Wahoo’s page (main Wahoo ACE site), indicating I should be seeing my actual power line shown, but it doesn’t work either:\n\nFinally, with everything finished, you can end your ride. Here you’ll get a ride summary screen, with information as such:\n\nThat said, one super frustrating piece is that despite having the new activity profiles (e.g., Mountain Bike, Gravel, etc…), none of those carry into Strava. Wahoo isn’t setting that attribute like all of their competitors are, and thus, you’ll still need to update these in Strava after the fact.\n\nNonetheless, all of your data otherwise does appear correctly there.\n\nThe Bike Bell:\n\nI was going to include the bike bell within the ‘Basics’ section above, but I figured I’d break it out. If for no other reason than to have one section that’s mostly positive.\n\nSomewhat humorously, Wahoo seemed keen to hide its best feature. All of Wahoo’s initial PR efforts almost entirely ignored the bike bell. Thankfully, at the last minute, they changed their mind. The Wahoo digital bike bell allows you to double-tap the screen to instantly hear a very loud and audible bike bell sound. It’s virtually indistinguishable from the Garmin Edge 1050 bike bell/sound.\n\nIt’s hard to visually show you the bike bell, because there’s no menu item. It just exists audibly, and as noted, you can double-tap anywhere on the screen to make it sound instantly. Well, sorta.\n\nAs long as that screen isn’t the map screen. For some odd reason, it doesn’t work on the map screen. Or the workout screen. Or the elevation screens. Wahoo said that was because there were concerns about people using touch on that map screen and thus accidentally ding-donging. Except, by default, touch on the map screen is already disabled (it has that little lock icon at right). Thus, no amount of rubby-rubby would have moved the map anyway. Certainly, simply unlocking the screen would have disabled the bike bell? Or, using the accelerometer to detect a double-tap would have been possible, no?\n\nIn any event, that (moderate) annoyance aside, the bike bell is awesome. You can also tap just below the pause button in the center of the screen:\n\nOne other thing to note about the bike bell is that it’s *always* at full volume. Meaning, no matter what settings you configure the rest of your audio alerts for (e.g. a less imposing volume), the bike bell remains the same volume. I actually appreciate this.\n\nHowever, I should also mention that unfortunately there is no method to configure the bike bell from the shifter buttons like on the Garmin Edge 1050 (or Hammerhead Karoo 3), which allows you to configure the extra shifter/bonus buttons to trigger the bike bell, which is super cool. Hopefully Wahoo will add that down the road.\n\nNavigation:\n\nWhen it comes to navigation, the ACE can route much the same as past Wahoo devices, though, there are some differences to be aware of that we’ll dive into.\n\nFirst though, is getting routes to your device. For most people, those routes will come from platforms like Strava, Komoot or other 3rd party entities. That said, you can import GPX/FIT/TCX files directly into it, using the Files app on your phone, and opening it with the Wahoo app. Or selecting a previous route from history.\n\nOnce that’s done, it’ll show up on the ‘Routes’ listing on your device, such as this:\n\nThat said, at the moment, this Routes listing is a giant shaker bottle of routes, without any ability to order the routes. In my case, I had Strava routes from years ago imported in, which is fine. But what’s not fine is that I can’t sort them in any way. I can only search them by name, which then requires me to remember exactly what I named each route that someone else might have created. Most bike computers, including all of Wahoo’s existing ones, have a sorting option at the top (such as by Date, A-Z, Starred, Length, and Proximity – as is the case on the Wahoo ROAM V2).\n\nDespite showing this on Wahoo’s marketing site, it’s not there today:\n\nWahoo says this will come at some point, hopefully soon. This is one of a number of examples of things being shown on the box, that are not on the unit in real-life.\n\nIn any case, once you’ve managed to find your route and select it, you’ll see an elevation profile and overview of the route.\n\nI do appreciate the easy option to ‘Reverse’ the route though, something that despite all logic and years of requests, doesn’t exist on a Garmin Edge series device (but does exist on their wearables).\n\nWith the route loaded, we’ll head out riding. If we were to look at the map page first, you’ll see the route as a series of chevrons on the route line. Moreover, the color of those chevrons indicates the climb gradients as you ride along, which is clever/handy:\n\nI do appreciate the coloring and map styles here. The way Wahoo has selected to colorize the different bits of info on the map screen (such as other streets/landscapes/etc…) makes this screen really easy to understand, and the thick chevrons make it easy to confirm your direction at a glance. That said, when dimmed (as effectively required to get half-decent battery life), it’s much harder to read.\n\nIf you tap the layers icon, you can adjust various map layers, including points of interest, custom waypoints, street names, wind, and Summit Segments. Note that in this context, ‘Wind’ doesn’t mean an overlay of the wind direction/forecast, but rather, just wind from the wind sensor.\n\nNote that Wahoo does include street names now on some streets. I haven’t quite figured out the exact pattern to which streets it shows them on, and which zoom levels. While some people love street names on maps, I rarely use them either way – likely because I’m more interested in the actual route line itself, which Wahoo does a good job on. I think they’ve found a good balance between the coloring of the map and the clarity of the chevron line.\n\n(Top: Wahoo ACE, left COROS Dura, right Hammerhead Karoo 3, bottom Garmin Edge 1050, right handlebar – badly in need of new bar tape.)\n\nLikewise, you can tap to enable the cue sheet as well at any time, if you’d prefer to see that:\n\nIn the event you’re on another data page (not the map page), and you have an upcoming turn, it’ll show a turn written prompt and give you an audible alert, and even voice directions to turn.\n\nBut again, there are two problems here. First, by default, none of these occur. You need to enable these voice turn alerts in the settings. Why on earth navigation and voice prompts aren’t enabled by default is beyond my pay grade.\n\nHowever, that gets to the second issue, the speaker volume. To be very clear: The speaker is loud AF (which is great for certain things). Seriously, it’s bone-jarringly loud. So loud your riding buddies will quickly try and body-check you into the nearest herd of cows they can find.\n\nFear not though, Wahoo has a solution for that, the volume slider. This slider has three levels: Loud AF, blah, and unbearable.\n\nFor navigation voice prompts, Loud AF is OK. I’d quibble that the voice should be slightly higher pitched, so it’s easier to hear in the wind, but that’s an easy change they could make. However, once you go down to the middle option, the voice is impossible to hear in the wind. And while the bike bell ignores the volume settings (as it should), there isn’t a way to separate voice prompt volume from the rest of the beeps your unit makes.\n\nAgain, their competitors have two sliders for a reason here: Voices are harder to hear in the wind than high-pitched beeps. Anyone who’s gone on a ride with friends knows this.\n\nIn any case, back to our ride. The next piece is your route profile that’s showing the elevation profile up ahead, seen at the bottom there. That elevation profile shows the next 2KM of your route….and only the next 2KM of your route:\n\nWhile past Wahoo units allowed far greater lengths than that (cough…the entire route), the ACE is limited here to 2KM.\n\nOnce again, the Wahoo box (and everything on the Wahoo site) shows this enumerating the full route as an elevation profile (showing ’Total’). And again, I’m not trying to be nit-picky here, but rather illustrating that this unit simply isn’t ready. Hard stop.\n\nI know this may come as a surprise to some: But stop shipping products that don’t do what it says on the box and your marketing site. Simply delay. The fastest way to get a reviewer angry is to literally not do the thing printed on the front of your box.\n\nNext, when it comes to on-demand routing, you can save locations at any point and navigate back to them, as well as drag to a point on the map (on unit) and route to it. Both of these are under the ‘routes’ option, then ‘Route To’ option).\n\nThese worked perfectly fine, and instantly, for me. Except the ability to rename saved waypoints, that doesn’t work at all right now. Thus, it’s just named whatever random street name you tapped (not ‘Home’ or ‘Work’ or ‘Hot Dog Stand’). Wahoo says that’s on the way too, though that too is listed as being a current feature on their marketing site.\n\nLikewise, the ability to select a point on the map from the Wahoo app doesn’t work either anymore (coming soonish). However, you can send a location from Google Maps or Apple Maps to the Wahoo app, and that worked intermittently for me.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that there are existing navigation providers that Wahoo hasn’t yet ported to the new Wahoo app yet. There’s no timelines on these, other than the second half of next year. But exactly which ones are getting re-added isn’t clear.\n\nThe Wind Sensor:\n\nRepeat after me: This is not an aero sensor, this is not an aero sensor, this is not an aero sensor.\n\nIt is however, a wind sensor capable of measuring wind speed coming into it. And while most aero sensors have that same starting point, that’s about where it ends. In fact, the jump from measuring aerodynamic drag is massive – but not so much hardware, rather, software and user education. It’s why almost every company that enters the cycling aero sensor landscape has failed. And almost all of those remaining that haven’t failed, have invariably pivoted towards coaching services instead. So get aero sensor out of your head, and let’s focus on what it actually is.\n\nInstead, the Wahoo ACE has a wind sensor for measuring the wind speed, then combining it with your known ground speed, and calculating whether you’ve got a headwind, tailwind, or some sort of drafting boost. It calls this “Wahoo Wind Dynamics”, which admittedly makes me giggle a little bit like a 6-year-old boy and think about the “wind dynamics” after eating Taco Bell.\n\nWhile riding, Wahoo gives you a single color-coded data field, titled Airspeed, which is shown in either Airspeed MPH or Airspeed KPH, just like the below (lower half is Airspeed, I’ve added ground speed to the upper half):\n\nThe coloring is basically the following groupings:\n\nThe idea being that you can quantify how much you’re saving when you tuck in behind someone to draft, because you’ll see those two numbers differ. If the AirSpeed is higher than the ground speed, you’ve got a headwind. If it’s lower, you’ve either got a tailwind or are drafting.\n\nI could then take the ground speed number, compare it to the airspeed number, do some mental math, and figure out exactly what the wind speed is (tailwind or headwind). Which…is yes, as silly as it sounds. To me, I shouldn’t have to be doing mental math on a ride constantly. It should simply do this automatically, and instead show me the final number – as either a headwind or tailwind/draft.\n\nAt the end of the ride, you’ll see the numbers shown on the unit with percentages of time spent in the different color-coded zones (labeled as either AirBoost or AirDrag):\n\nMy complaint here isn’t adding a wind sensor to the Wahoo bike computer. Instead, it’s that it’s just not providing any value beyond what I already know. And the singular area it could have provided value (showing impacts of drafting), is far too cumbersome of a number to be constantly doing mental math on. Just give me a number that we’re all calculating in our heads anyway.\n\nLong term, it remains to be seen how Wahoo can leverage this differently. I don’t see any viable path for Wahoo to use this for CdA calculations. Plenty of companies have tried, and given up there. Not because the tech wasn’t ready, but because 98% of riders don’t understand the *VAST* amounts of knowledge required to get proper aero testing done. Silly things like knowing the difference between your shoulders being firm or relaxed will hugely impact testing. Or that moving your fingers 1cm will impact testing. Or doing multiple test runs, etc…\n\nIt’s why virtually every aero sensor company on the market today that started life as a consumer aero sensor company/device, has shifted to being a coaching device, whereby the coach goes and does a seminar first to learn how to use the aero sensor, and then spends an absurd amount of time with athletes ensuring they execute tests correctly.\n\nPoint is, I feel like that weight could have been much better spent on an LED light (even as an emergency light because you’re running behind, or a built-in safety camera (akin to Cycliq Fly12), or…anything else.\n\nNow, all that said, for those geeks in the crowd, I will give Wahoo credit for properly populating the .FIT File with this data. In fact, they populate it with much more data than they show you on the screen. This includes the raw wind speed values, the categorization value (which of those color coded categories above), as well as a power to grade ratio value that they’ve been playing with in Alpha testing (you just don’t see the data field on our units, as that’s not available yet).\n\nIf you load any ACE file into the DCR Analyzer, you can see all this data using the ‘Developer Field’ toggle (which simply shows .FIT file data fields). Here’s the windy ride I did in the Netherlands with the 50KPH winds that day:\n\nNow, there’s a lot to look at. I’ve set my dot/curser at the highest wind point, where you can see the wind categorization is higher. The wind speed is shown in 1000 x m/s (meters/second), otherwise known as millimeters/second. The cool part is the data is there for people to use.\n\nAnd most critically, they do separate out the wind speed component here. Thus, I’d love for them to allow/show me a data field with just the wind speed component too. Note, that if you want to play with that original .FIT file, it’s located under the download link on the DCR Analyzer set page.\n\nBattery Burn:\n\nLook, it’s not good. There’s no two ways to say it. It falls *FAR* short of their claims of 30 hours of battery life, and is roughly in line with the Hammerhead Karoo 3’s battery life when the Karoo 3 is at 50% brightness (which is far brighter than the ACE screen can go). It falls behind the Garmin Edge 1050’s battery burn, and is leagues behind the Edge 1040 or Edge 1040 Solar battery. Again, in real-life numbers.\n\nSo, let’s look at the official claim and then a crap-ton of testing I’ve done. Officially, the claim is simply “up to 30+ hours”, depending on which part of the site you look at. Here’s the quote from their press release:\n\nBut in subsequent conversations, Wahoo clarified the actual claim is ’30 hours of GPS battery life with the backlight in 5-second off setting’. This means that after 5 seconds of touching the unit, the backlight turns off, and is unreadable depending on your lighting conditions. When in direct sunlight – no problems. But in the winter shade? Problems, especially on screens with smaller fonts (more data fields), or zoomed out maps.\n\nEven worse, the default configuration setting for the Wahoo ACE is the so-called “Auto” mode, which basically changes the backlight constantly, though short of summer sun on the beach, it seems to keep it at 100%. In that mode, I was burning roughly 8-12%/hour (across numerous 3-4 hour rides), depending on exactly which screen I was on. Yes, that puts it on target for 10-15 hours of battery life.\n\nThe ‘best’ battery scenario I could muster was 5.71%/hour (thus 17-hours) when I set it for 5-second off, on a mountain bike ride two days ago. Though, one couldn’t see the screen half the time, and given I was mountain biking, it wasn’t like I could just touch the screen easily to see it again.\n\nInterestingly, after a bunch of rides and different configurations, I noticed:\n\n– Plain data field pages obviously burned the least battery, though, if they had any color blocks in them (e.g. zone changing color blacks), they *destroyed* battery life, even more than the map page. This was true even with just two data fields, if one was color (e.g. the wind page),\n\n– There was no meaningful difference in the number of sensors paired impacting battery life.\n\n– There was no obvious difference between having navigation enabled or not, battery life seemed to burn equally.\n\n– None of these figures include LiveTracking or Strava Live Segments, as both are unavailable at this time. Further, none of these figures included screen recording enabled.\n\n– As noted, by far, the biggest impact was which backlight time setting was enabled.\n\nNow, Wahoo says a secondary low-power saving backlight mode is coming in the first half of 2025. This mode will find a better balance between the backlight setting and battery burn. Though honestly, I’m not convinced that’s the issue. I think Wahoo needs to look more carefully at the rest of the code running and optimize there instead.\n\nThe reason I say that, is if we look at the Hammerhead Karoo 3 and Edge 1050, both of which have *FAR* more demanding screens (in terms of battery burn), both can outperform it, even in far brighter settings with far smaller batteries. And then if we look at similar screen technology types, like the Edge 1040, that too easily outperforms it on any setting you want.\n\nPoint is, I don’t really understand why the battery burn is as bad as it is, for as big a battery as Wahoo has. And while I say the term “bad” here despite the Hammerhead Karoo 3 being similar, keep in mind the Karoo is basically half the size, and far brighter.\n\nGPS & Elevation Accuracy:\n\nWhile this review hasn’t been packed with good news, fear not, this section delivers in that realm. The quick version is the GPS accuracy via the dual-frequency GPS chipset, as well as the elevation accuracy, is spot on.\n\nOf course, let’s get into the data. In this case, most of my data sets have at least three other devices running, thus making the full set:\n\nWahoo ELEMNT ACE\n\nGarmin Edge 1050\n\nHammerhead Karoo 3\n\nCOROS DURA\n\nI also had an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and an AmazFit T-Rex 3 on most rides to cross-validate if I needed, but didn’t bother pulling them into these data sets, simply to keep things a little less jumbled.\n\nFirst up, let’s look at a four-hour road ride into the mountains. Here’s the high-level overview, where things obviously look identical:\n\nAfter zooming in on the entire track, it’s basically perfect. Nonetheless, let’s look at some of the mountain switchback sections, just to demonstrate it.\n\nAbove, you can see a descent. The way you can tell is how ‘tight’ the tracks are (or, by knowing my direction of travel…). In this case, the tracks are slightly looser (above), then below, which is a descent. Still, in both cases, the tracks are all within the roadway of the map, and nobody is doing anything funky.\n\nHere’s another very tight switchback section, with complete 180* turns:\n\nOf course, GPS accuracy is only one part of the picture. This route had plenty of climbing on it, and all four units were quite close. I’d quibble that the COROS DURA’s altimeter seems the least accurate of the four in my testing, sometimes being a bit offset, but hardly by much.\n\nWhen it comes to sensor data, I had both a power meter and heart rate sensor connected to all computers, all to the same sensor. Thus, you’d want to see identical data across them. And sure enough, that’s the case. Below is the heart rate graph, merely because it’s a bit “prettier” (easier) data set to look at since heart rate is far more stable than power. Point is, I’m not seeing any data connectivity or capture issues.\n\nFinally, I rarely include ‘totals’ stats in my accuracy sections, because they can be easily misleading. A device can undershoot and overshoot corners and still end up with the same distance as an accurate device. Nonetheless, for fun, here’s the total distance and ascent highlighted here. The COROS Dura is slightly further out on distance than the others, but is in the mix for ascent.\n\nOk, let’s quickly look at another data set, this one a three-hour ride, partially near the sea (some interesting tidbits there on elevation in a second), and partially up into the mountains.\n\nHere on one of the tight switchback sections (ascending), you notice a little bit of variance from the Edge 1050. That makes sense, as I was trying to get some pretty shots of the ACE solo on the handlebars, so the Karoo 3 and Edge 1050 were on my top-tube, and the Edge 1050 was closest to my crotch (with my body blocking it). In case you’re curious, that very photo is the last photo in this review (for the summary section). In any case, despite that, all three were very close:\n\nAnd even in the straightaways, all were fine too (you’d be surprised how often GPS units screw-up straightaways).\n\nThat said, the elevation is actually super interesting. To begin, it’s perfectly fine by most definitions. That said, we notice a few things. The first arrow is alongside the sea/water on the dock. Thus the Edge 1050 is clearly the most correct at 2.4 meters. Whereas the Karoo and Wahoo are a bit high there. However, as I ascend all the units seem to consolidate. The second arrow is where we stopped at a grocery store for about 20 minutes. Notice the very slight altimeter drift there on the ACE. Only about 1-2 meters, but I thought it was geeky interesting.\n\nIn any event, nobody likely cares about 1-2 meters of elevation drift (and frankly, neither do I).\n\nSo instead, let’s look at one more data set, a mountain bike set. This is a blend of trees, some riding near cliffs, and some open terrain. Here’s the overall view:\n\nI wouldn’t say this is crazy challenging GPS terrain (my road rides were actually tougher), but nonetheless, MTB it is (though I have gravel biked this route, but it’s spicy rough).\n\nIn any case, let’s start off with this tree section at a high view. Things look good, right?\n\nBut here’s the kicker when you zoom in: This is actually a loop, with repeated passes (from different directions). Very solid.\n\nHere’s some higher-speed descent stuff (doubled back up too), without any issues:\n\nThe elevation is again fodder for geeks. Those three arrows? It’s when I went down to the beach. I didn’t wheel dip, but was up on the shore at about 2m in altitude. You can see the ACE presents it as much higher at 5m in altitude. Not a huge deal there, though, the 15m offset on one of the climbs is surprising. Albeit, by the second climb, it is perfectly aligned.\n\nIn this case, my geekery aside, overall GPS and elevation on much longer/bigger/complex routes looks very solid. Zero issues there, and the same goes for data sensor connectivity, where I haven’t had any drops or connection issues once paired with sensors.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nCyclists kept asking Wahoo to make a bike computer with a better and bigger display, and on that specific point, they checked the box. In fact, I’ll even agree that their new home screen/dashboard is better than before. And that their map styling pages are very solid. And yes, the bike bell is awesome. Seriously, that’s (by far) the best feature on this unit.\n\nBut in almost every other category, Wahoo simply launched this device too early, and at too high of a price relative to their competitors or the capabilities the ACE has today. It lacks significant features and integrations seen on the Wahoo ROAM V2 or BOLT V2 (their current bike computers), and falls far short of the claimed 30 hours of battery life in my testing. And that’s before we talk about the screen visibility, or the value of the aero sensor. I just don’t understand why Wahoo keeps launching bike computers too early each time, while they stick the landing perfectly on trainer launches most times. There was zero reason to launch this in early December, versus waiting till next March.\n\nIn fact, it seems to be an industry trend this year. We saw the COROS Dura launch far too early, so much so the company then had to repeatedly delay shipping for both hardware and software reasons. We’ve seen startups JESPR and Absolute One also launch at both crazy-high prices and with the feature sets of a 2012 bike computer. Still, Hammerhead did launch their Karoo 3 this past spring to appropriate pricing, finished features with most of the polish required, and solid accuracy. And Garmin also launched their Edge 1050 this past summer at the same price as their previous top-end device, with virtually no complaints from reviewers or consumers alike.\n\nThe problem is, launching unbaked early gets you reviews like this. Reviews that live for *years* on the internet. Sure, perhaps I’ll update it as Wahoo improves in future firmware, but that won’t change the YouTube video, which can’t be updated. And sure, I could publish another YouTube video down the road each month they restore new features, but reviews months later rarely top the charts in consumer searches.\n\nI want companies like Wahoo or COROS to challenge the growing bike computer monopoly. I think both have significant unique things to offer there. In the case of COROS, it’s crazy battery life and extremely good pricing. In the case of Wahoo it tends to be simplicity and ease of use. But launching half-baked products like this only damages their reputation, furthering their competitors’ position.\n\nSigh.\n\nWith that, thanks for reading (or supporting independent reviews like this)!",

Others talk about having some kind of \"loading\" for transitioning between maps, which would be equivalent to a different raid in each one. Finally, some speak of a truly open world like DayZ.\n\nAnd thinking about it, the Streets map alone is very heavy. I wonder how having all the maps in an open world would be; it seems quite unthinkable, doesn't it?\n\nSo, what do we officially know today about Tarkov's open world?\n\n2 hours ago, brunnodrk said:\n\nWhen I bought the EFT beta in 2017, I used to hear a lot of people talking about EFT in an open world, but today hardly anyone says anything besides speculations.\n\nOk first to clarify those a bit.\n\nFirst it was suppose to be \"FREE ROAM\" MODE, so it was never intended to replace raid systems.\n\nAccording to some informations from interviews, it was suppose to act as \"1 big raid, without PMC respawns\" At least thats how i understand \"1 big map with 64 players\" but i may be wrong, it was never discussed exactly how it suppose to work.\n\nThen they said that this MODE will be unlocked once we escape from tarkov (finish story)\n\nAnd then, one of last informations was \"Propably instead 1 big map, there are gonna be 2, Streets and all other maps combined, reason is that Streets suppose to be \"as big as all other maps combined\".\n\nHere is post from 2019 where TheWay said it was still in plan\n\n(TheWay was like Main Emissary guy for Europe if i am correct)\n\nAnd i belive that in 2021 @ShiroTenshi did the same. I can't find it, but recently i had a talk with someone and i think i seen such post/comment.\n\nI think it's one of last informations about Free Roam Mode tho or like \"confirmations\" of any kind.\n\n2 hours ago, brunnodrk said:\n\nOthers talk about having some kind of \"loading\" for transitioning between maps, which would be equivalent to a different raid in each one.\n\nYes, at some point Nikita mentioned \"map to map travel\" as idea or place holder (or thats how most of ppl understood him).\n\nSo instead going straight to Labs, you would have to go Hideout -> Streets -> Labs -> Streets -> Hideout\n\nCause you know, not all maps are connected with Hideout and maps overall are connected with other maps.\n\n(fan made, not offical map, just how it \"could\" look like more or less)\n\n2 hours ago, brunnodrk said:\n\nSo, what do we officially know today about Tarkov's open world?\n\nWell, thing is that in 2016-2018 we did belive in such promises, but then with each other map, we (players) seen that such vision is most likely out of reach.\n\nI belive it still MIGHT be plan/idea for Tarkov, but it's not possible to do.\n\nWhy i think so?\n\nWell, imagine having all map combines (beside Streets), having 64 players and like 200 scavs + loot, it would be really bad for your FPS.\n\nOr there is better visualisation. STreets suppose to be \"as big as all other map combined\" so far it's not even near and we achive like 60-90 fps (On good PC) with only 18 players? And like 30 scavs?\n\nWhat i would really love to see, it's HONEST podcasts with Nikita, not those BS which we were getting, where Nikita does not answer 90% of \"good\" questions, just answer to some with \"It's planned\" \"we wanna do this\".\n\nI would love to see WHATS actually planned, a whole list and whats scraped.\n\nCause looking at Old Gameplays/trailers/interviews we have poo ton of content which was shown but it's cut.\n\nexample:\n\n- Customs dorms - Had a light switch (Gameplay trailer from 2016?)\n\n- Streets Primorsky - Had a light switch (One of first Streets Trailer)\n\n- Streets Concordia - Breakable wall (Battle of concorcia trailer?)\n\n- Melle knife kills animation - One of first EFT gameplay trailer\n\n- Grenade explosion effect (Flying debree, doors being opened by explosion) - One of first gameplay trailers\n\n- Lightkeeper announcments - \"FIrst in game TRADER\" meanwhile it's x wipe with him and he still does not sell anything\n\n- BTR on Streets - Having a group of AI riding on it - Streets Expansion trailer\n\n- \"Kolontay guard will have Ballistic shield, most likely either not lootable or that PMC will not be able to leave map with it and they will be in police station\" - Podcast/interview - Not existing in game\n\n- \"Clans will appear with EFT Arena\" - First informations about Arena in 2021 or 2022.\n\nANd way way way way way way more\n\nI just would love to know whats planned for sure and whats removed completly",
      "# [Someone asked if 80s kids really 'roamed freely.' After 40,000 answers, the truth is clear. by Annie  Reneau, www.facebook.com on 2024-11-22](https://www.upworthy.com/did-80s-kids-live-as-free-as-movies-show-after-40000-answers-the-truth-is-clear)\nAh, the nostalgia of an 80s childhood. If you've ever watched \"The Goonies\" or \"Stranger Things,\" you've seen how kids of all ages were largely left to their own devices most of the time, parents playing a background role if any role at all. Children went on unsupervised outdoor adventures for hours upon hours, getting into just enough trouble to learn some lessons but not enough to die (usually).\n\nBut is that really what childhood in the 80s was like? Were parents really that hands-off? Did kids really roam around freely like the movies and stereotypes portray? Were people really not worried about what the kids were up to when no one knew where they were and no one had cell phones to check in?\n\nSomeone asked that very question and the overwhelming response pointed to a clear answer.\n\nYes, 80s kids really did have childhoods that are hard to imagine now\n\n\"Did parents in the 80s really allow their kids to roam freely, or is that just a portrayal seen in movies?\" X user OThingstodo asked. Here are the top responses:\n\n\"Really. And it was awesome.\"\n\n\"Facts. We are the generation who raised ourselves. There really was a commercial that came on each night asking parents if they knew where their children were. We survived off hose water & anything we perceived as food. (Berries, fruit trees, etc) We were not allowed to sit inside.. if we tried, we'd get loaded down with chores. We truly were the feral generation.. we took no guts, no glory to new heights & feared absolutely nothing. It was amazing times that still, to this day, bring forth a rush of nostalgia at the smallest memory.\"\n\n\"This is so true. And Sometimes we just got to cook our own TV dinners. And our parents did not constantly have to engage us or make sure we weren’t bored.\"\n\n\"Allowed? We were not allowed in the house during the day. We had bikes and friends. There was 3 rules 1: don't get hurt 2: don't be brought home by the police 3: see that light? If it's on you're late and grounded.\"\n\n\"In the summer it was get home when the streetlights come on. Raised on hose water & neglect. It was glorious.\"\n\n\"I used to roam the sewer drains around town with my friends. Just a handful of us and some flashlights.\"\n\n\"Yep. We rode our bikes all over the place exploring reality. We also had unlicensed lemonade stands, and after we sold out, we’d ride up to the store alone to buy snacks alone. We had our own house keys, we stayed home alone after school, and we cooked for ourselves. No one freaked out about it either.\"\n\n\"We left the house after school and they wouldn’t see us until the street lights came on. Didn’t ask us where we had been or what we did either. We were raised on hose water and neglect in the 70’s and 80’s.\"\n\n\"Well into the 90s. They told us to be home for dinner by ___ or before nightfall. They didn't have a clue where we were or really any way of finding out. This was just the norm. ... then cell phones.\"\n\n\"It’s true. Realize that back then, there weren’t cell phones, video games, 24 hour kids TV, etc. You wanted to be with your friends & that was outside, even in winter. Your bike was your prized possession & while there were bad elements then too, it wasn’t like now. Sad.\"\n\nThat last point, \"while there were bad elements then too, it wasn't like now\" sentiment came up a lot in the responses. Let's dive into that a bit.\n\nIt's easy to look at the past through rose-colored glasses\n\nFor the most part, everything people said about those 80s childhoods is true, except this: The world was not safer back then. There weren't fewer \"bad elements\" and there wasn't less crime.\n\nAround the year 2015, articles started coming out about how children were statistically safer than they'd ever been.\n\nIn fact, statistically, the 80s were less safe than now by pretty much every measure. Looking at violent rime statistics from 1960 onward shows that the 80s had significantly higher violent crime rates than we've seen in the 2000s. The idea that Gen X childhoods were carefree with nothing to fear is simply wrong. We just weren't aware of everything there was to fear.\n\nSocial media and 24-hour cable news networks put scary things in front of our faces all day every day, giving us a skewed perception of reality. And that's not just conjecture—according to Pew Research, Americans tend to think crime is rising even when it's going down. \"In 23 of 27 Gallup surveys conducted since 1993, at least 60% of U.S. adults have said there is more crime nationally than there was the year before, despite the downward trend in crime rates during most of that period.\"\n\nThe folks remembering their free-range childhoods as blissful and safe seem to have forgotten that we started our days pouring milk from cartons that had pictures of missing children on them. A few high-profile abductions and murders of children caused a bit of a missing children panic in the U.S, leading President Reagan to sign the Missing Children Act in 1982 and the Missing Children's Assistance Act in 1984, which founded the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.\n\nBut \"high-profile\" in the 80s meant a spot on the nightly national news and a headline in a newspaper. Most crimes were only reported locally, there as no \"going viral online\" and it was easy to avoid scary news if you wanted to. We live in a totally different world today, but not in the way people think. We're safer by nearly every measure, from car accidents to infectious disease to violent crime. But we feel less safe, which directly affects how we parent our children.\n\nThere was indeed magic in our blissful ignorance\n\nThere's something to be said for being unaware of every bad thing that's happening in the world. We may have been less safe in the 80s in actuality, but not knowing that had its perks.\n\nThe question is, can we put the genie back in the bottle? Is it possible to give kids an 80s-style childhood in the age of ubiquitous screens and parents being arrested for letting their tweens walk less than a mile from home by themselves?\n\nSocietal expectations of what kids can and should do have changed drastically, as have levels of anxiety and fear in general. Parenting styles have shifted toward more involvement and greater attachment, which isn't bad in and of itself but can be taken to an extreme. The neglectful parenting style of the past wasn't ideal and neither is the overprotective style the pendulum swung to.\n\nIf we could somehow find a way to give kids the joy of unstructured outdoor exploration of the 80s and the stronger parent-child connections of the present, we might just hit the sweet spot of raising healthy kids. Perhaps the next generation of parents will figure it out.\n\nOne of the hardest parts of being a parent is never being sure whether you're doing a good job or totally bombing it. If you're conscientious enough to even wonder if you're a good parent, you probably are, but parenting entails a million little choices and interactions, and there's always a lingering voice in your head saying, \"What if you're really screwing this whole thing up?\"\n\nReassurance and encouragement are always appreciated by parents, but not always received, which is why a note from one camping dad to another has people celebrating the kindness of anonymous strangers.\n\n\"You are killing it as a dad.\"\n\nSomeone on Yosemite Reddit thread shared a photo of a handwritten note with the caption, \"To the man who left this thoughtful note on my windshield at Lower Pines Campground this weekend, I extend my heartfelt gratitude; your acknowledgment of my efforts to be a good father means a great deal to me.\"\n\nThe note reads:\n\n\"Bro,\n\nI camped in the spot behind you last night. Let me just say, you are killing it as a dad. First off, I watched your wife guide you in as you backed up your trailer and nailed it on the first try without any yelling. Then your kids unloaded from the truck and were mild-mannered and well behaved. You told stories around the campfire and I had the pleasure of listening to the sounds of giggles and laughter.\n\nFrom one dad to another, you are killing it. Keep it up.\n\nP.S. Whatever you cooked for dinner smelled delicious!\"\n\nHow often do we share these thoughts with strangers, even if we have them? And who wouldn't love to get a surprise bit of praise with specific examples of things we did right?\n\nEveryone needs to hear a compliment once in a while.\n\nSo many people found the note to be a breath of fresh air and a good reminder to compliment people when we feel the urge:\n\n\"That would make any daddy's eyes water.\"\n\n\"It’s always nice, as a guy, to get a compliment.\"\n\n\"I complimented a guy's glasses at work (I'm also a guy, and btw they were really cool glasses, I wasn't just being nice) and now he keeps trying to tell me where he got his glasses and how I should get some. But I'm just having to be polite because I already have glasses and I'm not in the market. I finally had to tell him I'm not going to buy them lmao I just like them on him.\n\nMade me feel like that's the first compliment he's had in years because he can't stop talking about it. Also I mainly liked the glasses because I think he's cute but he really thinks it's just the glasses haha jokes on him that cute bastard.\"\n\n\"I was in the store with my wife and one of our 'adopted nephews' yesterday (we’re close friends with his parents and we’ve known him and his brother since they were newborns and 2yo, respectively). A woman came up to me at checkout while my wife was running out to the car and said 'I’m not sure what your family relationship is here, but I just have to tell you how nice and refreshing it is to hear all the laughter and joy from the 3 of you. You both seem like such a good influence on him and it warms my heart.' It’s such a small thing but as a dude, I can’t remember the last time someone gave me a compliment in public and it made my freaking day.\"\n\n\"10/10 letter. The and not yelling part gave me a good chuckle lol.\"\n\n\"We need so much more of men getting such heartfelt and sincere compliments. Thanks for sharing. ❤️\"\n\n\"I’ve never considered leaving a note, but when I see a harmonious family with good parenting, it’s healing for me. My childhood was awful.\"\n\n\"Such an awesome compliment! Even though I don't have children myself, I like to remind my friends too that they're doing great & it brings them happy tears.\"\n\n\"This made me cry. I love that you are getting your 'flowers.' My dad sucked, I’m so glad you are one of the good ones.\"\n\n\"This made me cry too. It’s so hard to be a human. Let alone a parent. Getting a good job sticker every now and then really means a lot these days.\"\n\n\"I'm a big bearded guy and I would cry if I got this note. More people like this, please.\"\n\nThe best part of this story is that no one knows who the dad who wrote the note is, not even the dad who shared it. It wasn't written for clout or notoriety, it wasn't to get attention or make himself look good. No name or signature, just an anonymous act of kindness to uplift a stranger whether he needed it or not.\n\nWe all need to hear or read kind things said about us, and sometimes it means even more coming from an anonymous stranger who has nothing to gain by sharing. A good reminder to share it when you feel it—you never know how many people you may move and inspire.\n\nThis article originally appeared last year.\n\nThanks to an Olympic kite surfer being in just the right place at just the right time, a woman in danger of drowning was discovered far from shore and rescued off the coast of Brazil. And thank to the kite surfer testing out a new camera on his board, the whole dramatic incident was captured on film.\n\nBrazilian Olympian Bruno Lobo was out kite surfing off the coast of the city of São Luís, Brazil, on January 10, 2025, when he heard a cry for help. Soon he spotted a woman who was clearly struggling in the water. \"I promptly approached her with the kite, tried to calm her down and asked her to climb on my back (as) she was very tired and had no strength,\" he wrote in an Instagram post where he shared the video. It appears she was far from shore and was unable to get back by herself.\n\n“I was very surprised at that moment to see someone at that level in the sea, and when I recognized that she was drowning I promptly went in her direction to help,” Lobo told CNN Sport. He was able get her back to the shoreline where she was attended to by lifeguards.\n\nSome people were confused about how the rescue was filmed. It looks like Lobo was using a 360 degree camera attached to the end of his board. The technology of these cameras allows for a view from all angles, usually with a stabilization feature that makes for a smooth result. In addition, layering images from two lenses eliminates seeing the stick that's attached to the camera, making it look like the camera was just hovering in the air.\n\nIt was Lobo's desire to test the camera that prompted him to go out that day. The woman, who has since been identified as Maria Eduarda, shared her thanks in the comments of Lobo's post:\n\n\"Words can't describe my gratitude! It was the salvation that God and my guides sent to me. I really could not handle it if I spent 5 minutes on the high sea even knowing how to swim and using anti-drowning techniques. Thank you very much and I wish you showers of blessings in your life!\" Eduardo truly was fortunate, since Lobo had considered not going out that day due to the cloudiness.\n\nThe governor of the Brazilian state of Maranhão presented Lobo a medal of honor \"in recognition of his act of bravery in saving the young Maria Eduarda,\" adding that the kite surfer \"makes Maranhão proud in sport and in life.\"\n\nThe rescue is a good close-up illustration of how hard it is to see someone in the water, even when conditions are relatively calm. It's also a reminder that even strong swimmers can be pulled by strong currents and find themselves in a harrowing situation without warning. Some people shared that the Brazilian in particular can be dangerous.\n\n\"The rip tides along the entire coast of Brazil kill hundreds each year. Locals all know which beaches can be enjoyed under what conditions, but tourists have no idea.\"\n\n\"I was helicoptered out of a rip tide off the east coast of Brazil. This brings back memories.\"\n\n\"A tip from a native Floridian for tourists: Rip tides are narrow. If you find yourself being pulled out by a rip tide, swim parallel to the beach until you're out of the current and then swim to shore. You will never make it fighting directly against the current.\"\n\nLobo, who is an orthopedic surgeon in addition to being an Olympic kite surfer, also warned people to respect the water. \"Stay alert about the danger of the sea, rivers and anywhere you don't know because the current in some places is usually very strong!\" he wrote.\n\nIn reflecting on the events of that day and the interviews he fielded in the aftermath, Lobo said he was only doing his duty and that he felt he was being used as an instrument of divine intervention. \"We don't explain how God does, but I know he has a purpose for each of us!\" he wrote. \"May we be instruments in His hand, to love others and to do good.☝🏻 🙏🏻\"",
      "# [Why It’s Time to Move On from Roam Research and Embrace New Tools by Ann P, medium.com on 2024-10-20](https://medium.com/@ann_p/why-its-time-to-move-on-from-roam-research-and-embrace-new-tools-ed678d911971)\nRoam Research was once a popular choice for organizing thoughts with features like bi-directional linking and a non-linear approach. However, in the fast-paced world of productivity apps, it can quickly become outdated compared to newer tools designed for modern users.\n\nEffective note-taking tools boost productivity by capturing ideas and organizing information. As demands grow, our tools must evolve to avoid hindering productivity.\n\nIt’s time to explore alternatives that not only match Roam’s capabilities but surpass them in innovation and user experience. Obsidian is popular among the best productivity apps due to its Markdown support and unique bi-directional linking feature. However, we must ask: do these productivity apps outperform Obsidian in note-taking?\n\nReady to change your note-taking habits? Discover new tools offering better functionality and flexibility. Let’s explore what’s next in note-taking.\n\nThe Limitations of Roam Research\n\nRoam Research, once favored for organizing complex thoughts, now faces limitations making it appear outdated.\n\nPerformance Issues: Users report slow performance with large databases, affecting productivity.\n\nLack of Mobile Apps: Without native mobile support, on-the-go access is restricted, hindering modern workflows.\n\nSecurity Concerns: Inadequate data protection and unclear policies raise privacy concerns.\n\nThese challenges prompt users to seek newer solutions that better align with current needs.\n\nWhy Users are Seeking Alternatives\n\nThe digital note-taking landscape is evolving along with user needs. As people seek greater productivity, they’re exploring alternatives to Roam Research. Users now require adaptable features for dynamic work processes.\n\nIntegration is Essential: Modern apps demand seamless integration with task managers, calendars, and communication platforms, creating a cohesive workflow and minimizing app-switching friction.\n\nDemand for Advanced Features: Users call for robust features like enhanced collaboration and AI-powered search.

The market offers options meeting these needs, signaling an exciting future for personal knowledge management.\n\nTop Alternatives to Roam Research You Should Consider\n\nNotion: The All-in-One Workspace for Seamless Collaboration and Project Management\n\nNotion is a versatile tool that goes beyond just note-taking. It combines various features to create a comprehensive workspace for both individuals and teams.\n\nHere are some key reasons why Notion stands out:\n\nCustomizable Databases: Notion allows users to create databases tailored to their specific needs. This means you can build your own CRM or track projects with detailed data points that align with your workflow.\n\nTemplates Galore: Notion offers a wide range of templates for different purposes, such as meeting notes or product roadmaps. These templates can be customized to suit your requirements, providing a personalized experience.\n\nWhile some may find the abundance of features overwhelming, others see it as an opportunity to customize their workspace according to their preferences. The balance between complexity and customization is something many users find worthwhile, especially if they’re moving away from Roam Research’s simpler setup.\n\nIn essence, if you’re seeking a tool that can handle both everyday tasks and larger projects — where everything is managed in one place — Notion might be the upgrade you didn’t realize you needed.\n\nObsidian: The Power of Offline Knowledge Management with a Graph-Based Interface\n\nWhen it comes to note-taking and managing knowledge, Obsidian is a strong alternative to Roam Research. What sets Obsidian apart is its graph view feature, which allows users to visually map out their notes and ideas, creating a network of interconnected thoughts. This powerful visualization not only helps in understanding complex relationships between concepts but also sparks creativity by revealing unexpected connections, similar to how mind mapping enhances creative thinking through visual organization of information.\n\nCustomization for Personal Preferences\n\nAnother area where Obsidian excels is customization. Users have the ability to tailor their workspace according to their personal preferences. This includes choosing themes that align with their aesthetic tastes and implementing plugins that enhance functionality. Such flexibility caters to diverse user needs and makes Obsidian a tool that evolves alongside your note-taking habits.\n\nWhy Choose Obsidian Over Others?\n\nWhy consider Obsidian over alternatives like Notion or Amplenote? For those who prioritize offline work while exploring intricate idea networks, Obsidian offers an unmatched experience. Its focus on privacy and data control is appealing for security-conscious users.\n\nHowever, while Obsidian is popular for its flexibility and features, it may not suit everyone. Many alternatives might better fit individual needs.\n\nAmong modern note-taking tools, Obsidian challenges the notion that “Roam Research is Ancient,” promoting a future of intuitive and personal knowledge management. For those struggling with forgetfulness despite advanced tools like Obsidian, solutions such as the Constella app can assist in effectively managing notes and tasks.\n\nAmplenote: Boosting Your Productivity with Integrated Task Management Features\n\nAmplenote is a powerful alternative to Roam Research among modern note-taking tools. It stands out by combining note-taking and task management features, providing a comprehensive solution for personal productivity. With Amplenote, your ideas are not just left hanging but are organized into actionable tasks.\n\nNote-Taking Redefined\n\nIn Amplenote, note-taking goes beyond simply writing down thoughts. It creates an environment where ideas and tasks are connected, ensuring that nothing gets forgotten. The tool is built to turn messy thoughts into well-organized action plans, making it an essential tool for those who thrive on being organized.\n\nStay on Track with Calendar Integration\n\nOne of Amplenote’s standout features is its calendar integration. By syncing your notes with a calendar, it offers a visual timeline that helps users stay focused and meet deadlines effectively. This feature works like a personal assistant, gently reminding you of your productivity goals without adding unnecessary stress.\n\nAmplenote shows why some people see Roam Research as outdated; it innovates by addressing current demands in flexible task management and user-friendly design, offering a fresh perspective on productivity tools that could reshape how we handle our daily tasks.\n\nRemNote: Transforming Learning and Memory Retention with Spaced Repetition Techniques\n\nIntroducing RemNote, a tool that seems to have cracked the code for efficient knowledge retention. Its secret weapon? The use of spaced repetition algorithms. Imagine having a digital assistant that knows exactly when to nudge your memory, ensuring you never forget essential information. How many times have we wished our brains came with built-in reminders? RemNote makes that dream a reality.\n\nBut RemNote isn’t just about playing memory games; it’s also about creating a smooth journey through your thoughts. With its unique backlinking capabilities, users can effortlessly navigate between related notes. Picture it as having an intricate web of ideas at your fingertips, where each thread pulls you closer to mastering complex topics.\n\nFor those who’ve found themselves frustrated by the simplicity and limitations of Roam Research, RemNote offers a refreshing alternative. It’s not just another note-taking app; it’s a learning companion eager to enhance how you absorb and connect knowledge. Move over, Roam Research — RemNote is here to redefine what it means to truly know something.\n\nTana: Advanced Organizational Features for Complex Note Structures You Can Easily Manage\n\nTana is a great alternative to Roam Research, offering a sophisticated approach to organizing complex note structures. If you’ve ever felt lost navigating through a digital maze of notes, Tana’s powerful tagging system might just be your guiding star. Tags in Tana aren’t just labels; they’re tools that allow you to categorize and filter information with precision and ease. Imagine having the ability to cut through your data jungle and find exactly what you need, when you need it.\n\nBut what really makes Tana stand out is its block-level transclusion. This might sound complicated, but it’s a game-changer for note management. Transclusion allows you to dynamically link different parts of your notes. It’s like having pieces of a puzzle that can rearrange themselves depending on the picture you’re trying to build at any given moment. This feature not only enhances flexibility but also ensures that your information remains interconnected and coherent.\n\nAnytype: Prioritizing Security without Compromising Functionality in Your Note-Taking Experience\n\nIn the world of note-taking tools, Anytype stands out by addressing a concern that’s becoming increasingly important — data security and privacy. While tools like Notion, Obsidian, Amplenote, RemNote, and Tana focus on enhancing productivity through various innovative features, Anytype takes a different approach by ensuring your data is protected with local storage and encryption measures. This commitment means that your notes are stored directly on your device rather than in the cloud, offering peace of mind for those wary of potential data breaches.\n\nOpen-Source Transparency\n\nBeing an open-source platform, Anytype promotes transparency and community collaboration. Users can explore its codebase, ensuring that no backdoors or unwelcome surprises exist within its architecture. This openness not only builds trust but invites contributions from users eager to enhance the tool’s capabilities.\n\nA Modern Alternative to Roam Research\n\nWhile Roam Research is outdated in tech terms due to its lack of native mobile support and performance issues, Anytype emerges as a modern contender that doesn’t skimp on functionality. Its emphasis on privacy makes it a compelling choice for anyone seeking secure yet efficient alternatives to Roam Research. With resources like this comprehensive guide on how to maximize your productivity with Anytype, users can fully harness the potential of this dynamic tool. So why stick with the old when you can explore these dynamic options?\n\nEmbracing New Tools for an Optimized Note-Taking Experience Beyond Roam Research\n\nSwitching from Roam Research to newer tools is like upgrading from a flip phone to a smartphone. Modern alternatives offer noticeable performance improvements, addressing common grievances about Roam’s sluggishness. These cutting-edge tools provide innovative features such as AI-powered semantic search, meeting the evolving needs of users seeking more than basic functionalities.\n\nThe rise of AI-powered note-taking has significantly transformed productivity. Consider how these tools cater to dynamic user needs:\n\nSemantic Search: AI-powered search functions mean that finding your notes is not about remembering exact phrases but understanding concepts and ideas.\n\nCustomization Options: From block-level transclusion in Tana to Obsidian’s graph-based interface, customization allows each user to tailor their experience.\n\nIntegration Capabilities: Seamless integration with calendars, task management systems, and other productivity tools ensures a cohesive workflow.\n\nThese features collectively create an optimized environment for knowledge management, making the transition from Roam Research not just logical but essential for those seeking efficiency and innovation in their daily processes.\n\nConclusion: It’s Time To Move On From Roam And Embrace A New Era Of Note-Taking Tools!\n\nThe tools we’ve explored, from Notion to Obsidian, each offer unique capabilities that cater to the dynamic and multifaceted needs of modern users.\n\nWhy settle for limitations when you can unlock potential?

      "# [Coupling As Many Different Locomotives Together](https://forums.dovetailgames.com/threads/coupling-as-many-different-locomotives-together.78233/)\nhappy 2024 TSW family! I hope you all had great holiday vacation. After being hospitalized for the whole month of December I'm happy to announce I am finally back home And catching up with everything related to TSW. I have been playing around with free roam as I really didn't get a chance to check it out or even go into full depth of what you can and cannot do in this new feature. to make a long story short I have spawned in Midland mainline and basically try to couple as many American trains with the same couplers together. I have literally spent days putting together many different combinations At my favorite point/station in Midland Mainline alongside what I thought to be nuclear reactors Or from what I was told to be a gas plant.\n\nthis was very tedious and found myself yard shunting for literally three days straight before burning myself all of the different Consists lol. I had so much fun messing around with this new feature that I had to make a video showing off my Frankenstein consist is what I'm going to call it and also would like to know if anyone else has tried this with UK or German locomotives. Keep in mind most trains as long as they have the same coupler can pair together but in some cases cannot couple or even move once coupled together due to incompatibility. I do not own all of UK's content and the same could be said for some German routes I still need to get Which is why I mainly focused on what I owned most of.\n\nI do want to add that you can couple the class 66 and the class 43 with American consist Due to the fact they share the same knuckle coupler.\n\nhope you guys enjoy the video and if has a UK version or a German version please share video and pictures down below I would like to see as I think it's really cool\n\nback in the day it was coal fired think in more recent they may have switched to gas bio fuels or may still burn some coal ..with all the clean green energy pushed nowadays lot s of coal fired power stations being closed demolished or converted to natural gas bio fuels etc ..in the game when i went back into unloading loop there a big pile of coal ..i wish they would do a cargo pack for services to power station but free roam will let you do that",
      "# [Gran Turismo 8 - if you had the power to completely design the experience… by NC mrbabyboyd, Famine GTP Editor, OR Jump_Ace JUMPxACE on 2024-05-06](https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/gran-turismo-8-if-you-had-the-power-to-completely-design-the-experience%E2%80%A6.426731/)\nHi all,\n\nGiven the current state of Gran Turismo 7 (and it will continue to expand), I’ve always wondered how people (the GTPlanet community) would design the play experience of Gran Turismo 8.\n\nI’d love to hear (and even see) how you would layout the career mode, for example:\n\nWould it be similar to previous games in terms of the layout e.g. Beginner, Professional events etc?\n\nWhat features would you implement and how would you design them e.g. Driving Missions and how you’d have them, or drag racing mode for example?\n\nHow the cars would be displayed in dealerships and how you want them to appear and how the pricing works for them?\n\nHow would you design, change (or remove entirely) the license tests?\n\nHow would you design an arcade mode - all cars and tracks available instantly, or have it like Gran Turismo 4, or even Gran Turismo 3 for example?\n\nThe online experience and how daily races, time trials work and perhaps other things you come up with?\n\nOther things to make the career mode in your eyes “better”?\n\nDISCLAIMER: I fully appreciate that Gran Turismo 7 has plenty of longevity left and there are still key improvements we want for Gran Turismo 7 before we even think about Gran Turismo 8. Therefore treat this as a bit of fun - treat it as Polyphony Digital is giving YOU the power to decide how a Gran Turismo 8 experience would/should be. I would like Gran Turismo 7 to be the best it can be before a Gran Turismo 8 would appear.\n\nPenultimately, I also appreciate if this is technically not in the right forum place but I can’t really see where else.\n\nFinally, I’ll at some point apply my input - otherwise if you have ideas, designs/spreadsheets etc, then I’d love to hear and see them.\n\n(If something like this exists already, then this sub-forum topic can be removed).\n\nHere's the idea I've always in my head, which I don't remotely have the artistic talent to mock up unfortunately.\n\nGT is better when it focuses on the cars rather than being about the driver IMO - that's far better done by sims that focus on racing cars. So I've tried to fit the career to the car roster, rather than trying to force a racing sim career onto a car roster that isn't built for it.\n\nThe main career screen would be a timeline, with rows for each decade between the 1950s to 2020s (with maybe a nebulous \"future\" one after that for VGT stuff). Then, you'd have cups, based on various road car themes, that go across the timeline like so:\n\nAn 86 vs BRZ Cup cup that would have a 1980s round for the Levin/Trueno, a 2010s round for the gen 1 86/BRZ, and a 2020s round for the gen 2 GR86/BRZ.\n\nA Corvette Festival cup that would have a 50s round for the C1, a 60s round for the C2/C3, an 80s round for the C4, an 00s round for the C6, a 10s round for the C7 and a 20s round for the C8. A 90s round could be added if a C5 was DLC.\n\nA SEMA cup that would currently just have a 10s round, but could add a 00s round if previous winners were added.\n\nFerrari Challenge, which would have rounds in every decade (except the 20s currently)\n\nYou could also do entry level stuff like Sunday Cup, which would combine the current Sunday Cup and Sunday Cup Classic (and actually have a power limit this time), so you'd have an entry level event to enter your Mazda3 in.\n\nWinning all events in a cup would provide a car that would help for a related cup, for example the 86/BRZ cup might reward you with an Impreza or a Supra for Stars of Pleiades or a Supra cup.\n\nBut the real goal you would be working towards while completing cups is to fully complete a decade. When you complete all events in a decade, you would unlock a race championship or championships for that decade:\n\nCompleting all the 50s events would unlock a championship for cars like the W194 or the old Maserati\n\nCompleting all the 60s events would unlock a championship balanced for the three legendary cars (though you could still enter stuff like the 250 GT)\n\nThe 70s is kinda hard, only the 917K and 2J are there at the minute. This would need more cars added.\n\nCompleting the 80s would unlock a Group C Championship (you can use the early 90s cars) and a Group B rally championship\n\nCompleting the 90s would unlock a GT1 championship and a classic GT500 championship and a Group A rally championship\n\nCompleting the 00s would unlock an early LMP championship that would again need cars like the R8 and Speed 8 to be added\n\nCompleting the 10s would unlock a GT3 championship and an LMP1 championship\n\nCompleting the 20s would unlock a hypercar championship and a modern GT500 championship\n\nThen beating all the decade race championships would unlock the \"final boss\" race championships like the X2019 or the formula cars, maybe the endurances too.\n\nI like the idea because it puts the \"learning about car history\" idea (that's kind of the core ideal of the franchise at this point) into the actual races instead of being relegated to text everybody skips. But it also gives players freedom to do different stuff in different orders, while still retaining progression and having a goal people are aiming for.\n\nRacing:\n\nCompletely remove the Cafe as the gameplay progression mechanic. It feels arbitrarily small and limiting. I don't mind the concept of the Cafe as an element of the game, but it shouldn't be the thing the whole game revolves around. For the racing calendar, replace it with some kind of race hub that allows you to join teams to compete at different levels of motorsport - and with that, most races should be at least 10 laps, and most of them should be part of championships. The 3 lap chase the rabbit battles in GT7 are so bad...\n\nA proper endurance racing series with at least 10 races per car classification. (These could totally be multi-class events that you need to win in each class).\n\nOther:\n\nAside from the very basic changes above that I think are needed to make GT a proper racing game, I'd like to see PD try some new things, and try a little harder on some other things:\n\nWhy not some kind of open road area? The scapes movies are such a tease - I'd love to escape the race track in a GT title. This may be a game unto itself depending on the scope of implementation but I would honestly be happy with just some great point to point locations such as:\n\nCalifornia Coast\n\nGerman Autobahn\n\nTokyo Highway (free roam)\n\nRoute Napolean\n\nMt. Haruna\n\nLake Como Loop\n\nFor a series with so much chill between gameplay, there is a frustrating lack of chill (including down to the music selections) available during actual driving - particularly in the ridiculously short chase the rabbit events. Even the baffling music missions, seemingly a great opportunity to chill, are frantic as hell. There is no relaxing driving in this game, and that's kind of a missed opportunity, IMO. What if you could, while in VR, sit in the back of a Toyota Alphard listening to music while another player is driving around a Tokyo freeway at night? I'd be into it.\n\nThe other thing tragically lacking, despite it's continued inclusion, is off road driving. I don't know if Kaz thinks PD's implementation of \"rally\" driving is fun or what, but it seriously needs a rethink. I remember being super stoked at the idea of rally racing being part of GT2 prior to that game's release, and then being disappointed in it's implementation back then....when I was like 10. It hasn't improved in the quarter century since then, sadly. While I get that stage races might not be the gameplay PD wants to spend time developing, there has GOT to be a better way to do dirt than the absolutely terrible and geographically suspect (THIS is the approximate IRL location of the Colorado springs circuit, per the weather radar - which really makes you wonder what they were thinking every step of the way...) implementation they settled on. Honestly, GT2-4 had way, way better dirt circuits than GT5-GT7, which isn't saying much.\n\nIf all else fails, look back to GT4.\n\nCool thread idea!\n\n1) Make what I call a 'Money Race'. Where it's a single race, medium length (like 5-10laps), medium difficulty race where you win a significant car for a more difficult series later on. And said car just happens to be worth a ton of money (1-3mil?). Did I mention you could do this race over and over to win the prize car again and again?\n\n2) Bring back every original track in their former GT6 glory in hi-res, along with the new ones (because why not?).\n\n3) Bring back every actual race track in former GT titles.\n\n4) Bring back all the missing cars from GT3 & GT4, in their current gen, hi-res, ray tracing form.\n\n5) Bring Sophy to its full potential, dump the old AI completely. Along with scalable difficulty for each race.\n\n6) Improve BOP\n\n7) Improve Penalty System\n\n8) Add a little bit of storyline to the offline career mode with two calendars; kart to professional racing calendar and a fun/off season, or maybe invitational only calendar. Perhaps the protagonist's father was a pro driver but only made it to GT4 and tragically died in a race (your uncle raised you and brought you up in racing); one you eventually do yourself. I'm thinking the professional race calendar would be races in which car specs are locked down or use BOP and you earn top prize money. The invitational calendar would host more open, 'suggested' BHP races, smaller payouts but with those valuable prize cars.\n\n9) The only restriction to buying a car is money; no more invitations\n\n10) Add caster and tire pressure adjustments\n\n11) Add a proper clutch option, that does not instantly make you faster when using it\n\n12) Update physics engine and tire model (ACC physics anyone?)\n\n13) Bring back slow motion replays along with control inputs for them. Or better yet, integrate with Motec.\n\n14) Make the drift events completely optional (rewardless). Even expand upon what was in GT7, but don't force me to do them, also\n\n15) Bring back side events like the One Lap Magic and Driving Missions from GT4 (but leave out Mission 34, or if you bring it back, don't make us wait 90 seconds, c'mon now)\n\n16) Increase the license test difficulty.\n\nI think the visuals are on point and polished, I love the PSVR2 and motion option and I think the sound is 'fine'. If PD outsourced some of this work, it may be possible to get it all done. If this was all promised, I'd be fine waiting another 4-5 years before GT8 launched.\n\nJerome\n\nThis:\n\nYep, pretty much this. GT5 is of course where it all went wrong\n\nIt's difficult to resolved the two things GT wants now - progressively unlocking circuits (GTS/GT7) and teaching players about cars (GT7) - with a web-like career, but it's certainly doable.\n\nHere's my quick'n'dirty overview:\n\nBy way of explanation here:\n\nWithout any progress at all:\n\nThere's five basic Menu Books that introduce you to various things core to the game\n\n~20 races at three-to-six beginner circuits (one/two in each region) covering Sunday Cup and Sunday Cup Classic-type races or track days; low powered cars sub-400PP. These are not linked to the career at all.\n\nYou must complete your B Licence and Book 5 to advance to...\n\nPathway Choice 1 which:\n\nGives you the option of choosing your preferred route: GT, Sports Car, Prototype, Open-Wheel (and whatever else)\n\nEach path has a handful of relevant Menu Books (let's say... three), each unlocking a race series at that level\n\nAt this stage they are national level races (not necessarily requiring just one country's tracks...) at an amateur grade, up to 500PP or so.\n\nComplete a minimum number (say... three again, accounting for updates) the Menu Books to advance to Licence A which unlocks...\n\nPathway Choice 2 which:\n\nAllows you to switch paths or remain on the same one.\n\nSame format again, unlocking more series, but at a higher level - more races across more tracks within the region.\n\nCompleting any one path grants a Bronze Trophy, unlocks Licence IA, and advances you to...\n\nPathway Choice 3 which:\n\nAgain allows you to switch or not.\n\nMuch higher level races again, unlocking more series, taking place at tracks across the globe\n\nCompleting any one path grants a Silver Trophy, unlocks Licence S, and advances you to...\n\nPathway Choice 4, the final choice, which:\n\nGives you one last chance to switch if you wish\n\nLongest and hardest races, endurance level (optional to shorten the race time with higher rates of wear/weather, no less than 30 min)\n\nAwards one Gold Trophy no matter which path and ending movie for completion\n\nAll tracks unlocked at this point\n\nPlayers may then (and let's say at any point too) go back and attempt other pathways, with the relevant menu books, to mop up the trophies (licences no longer required)\n\nUpdates can add more races/series and Menu Books into each section (as only [x] are required to advance this adds options rather than more requirements), as well as optional Menu Books beyond the time line if necessary.\n\nThat's just my \"top of the head\" design anyway.\n\nWhat could Rockstar Games of today teach Polyphony about designing a compelling game?\n\nRIght, there is somewhat of a story going on in the F1 franchise...and agree it's pretty bad, but is GT7's Cafe any better? I think there could be more of a story, or more of a journey through an informative and challenging progression system, or something completely different that enhances the...\n\nAlso, as that's just the career, with every car/track unlocked for Arcade Mode, Livery Editor, and Photomode from the start.\n\nI guess I'm the only one who doesn't like \"everything unlocked\". I've said it elsewhere, but I loved the memories of going to a friend's house to play Gran Turismo 2, and being impressed by all the cars in his garage that I'd never seen before. We'd exchange the secret info of which cars could be found where, it was a lot of fun and made for a unique experience.\n\nSpeaking of Gran Turismo 2 and secrets, its somewhat convoluted dealer layout was great for hiding things, and made the game feel even bigger than it already was. It might sound silly, but having to manually click on individual cars instead of scrolling through that horizontal list made it feel like you were really exploring and discovering things. It's probably not as impressive to seasoned car guys, but for a kid who was only just learning, it was always exciting to poke around the corners of the dealership and be presented with some cool or weird car you didn't know existed.\n\nThe other thing I liked about Gran Turismo 2's dealerships was the \"Special\" category. It felt more organized to me when the racing and concept cars were kept separate from the normal production vehicles. So yeah, my ideal Gran Turismo would have GT2-style car shopping.\n\nI also prefer the open-ended early game of the first five games, where there were many cheap cars to choose from, and you could stick with your starter car and gradually tune it up for awhile. Nothing was more disheartening than starting up Gran Turismo 6 and being forced to buy that Honda Fit. Then GT7 came along with only three choices, then hurriedly ushered you along to a different car after the three intro races. I'm really not a fan of GT7's collection focus that pushes you to constantly change vehicles instead of having fun with your own choices.\n\nBasically, I want:\n\n1. Secrets\n\n2. Cheap cars and things to do with them\n\n3. Seattle Circuit\n\nI'd re-do the audio design and make it much more immersive similar to Project Gotham and Forza Motorsport 4 where the cars have individual intake, engine and exhaust sounds recorded in stereo to match the in-game camera angle so when you turn the camera to the front of the car for example you hear the intake and the exhaust from the rear; as for me personally this makes the experience much more immersive, both the latest Forza and GT7 suffer from Mono exterior audio where Stereo will make the experience much better. I'd also make the high performance and race cars much more brash sounding as they sound overly clean at the moment.\n\nI'll always welcome better sound, but GTS and GT7 made such incredible leaps over their predecessors that its no longer something that breaks the game for me. Every car sounds at least pretty good and in the very least accurate.\n\nI really liked the manufacturer cups in previous games. Here's an idea - get rid of the invitation system as it stands and replace it with one based on brand affinity. Say you really like using Mercedes / AMG cars. How about after 1000 miles of driving Mercedes in races, Mercedes sends you an invitation to not only BUY something special (Lets say a 2000 CLK DTM) but also to compete in a special event, say drive the CLK DTM in a 2000s DTM race series. To add another layer of depth, lets say you win that series - in the CLK. Maybe the prize for that is being rewarded with the ultra rare CLK DTM road car.\n\nNow lets pretend you did that same series but with the Alfa Romeo 155 DTM (purchased from an invitation in a similar way) perhaps you could unlock an Alfa Romeo SZ or some similar - there would be a reason to go back and do the same races over again.\n\nI think the different strands, almost like quests in RPGs, could add a ton of depth to a GT title, and I think it would feel special to unlock these cars that require a few steps to get to.\n\nHere's what I would focus on:\n\n1) Mimic the GT4 career mode as much as possible. Why was GT4 so great?\n\n* The obvious career progression from a Toyota Yaris to a Toyota LMP. Beginner to Expert league. You feel that adrenaline and excitement when you enter the GT World Championship for the first time.\n\nGT7 still has some of this, but the complaints about the cafe menu linearity are valid. I think the cafe menus are fine, the mistake is that they form the backbone of the career mode. Maybe your classic \"GT League\" progression is the main game mode and the cafe menus are side quests. The bonus here is the cafe menus become more fun when they're less structured and not THE primary game mode. Let's say you have a cafe menu to collect Nissan Silvias, so you must watch the UCD for them or maybe you win one from another event. Wouldn't that be more fun than doing 3 races, winning the 3 Silvias you need, and moving on? Again, the game progression wouldn't be locked to the UCD - just the \"side quests.\"\n\n* A decent mix of championships and standalone \"spot races.\" Both have a place in the game, but it's fun counting points until the last race of the season.\n\n* The prize cars from each event. It was fun doing a championship and wondering \"what car will I win at the end of this?\" And it made the grind easier. We don't need to give out a $500k rally car (that can be obtained infinite times) on an A license race...but we can also do better than GT7.\n\nMaybe give out car roulette tickets as event prizes, and you can win those tickets over and over? A 3* car ticket gives you a Toyota 86 or similar, a 4* gives you a BMW M4, a 5* gives you a Gr.3/Gr.4/supercar, and a 6* gives you a high end race car or hyper car? Each ticket can have a low probability of a jackpot prize that increases as you progress through the game.\n\nThis would add motivation to re-doing old races without wrecking the economy.\n\n* There was a \"home race\" for almost every car in the game. WTC 800 is not \"home\" for the Chaparral 2J. WTC 700 is not \"home\" for the Ford GT40 or Ferrari P4. What race does my Porsche 917K fit into? The Neo-Classic race is awesome on paper but is a functionally jumbled mess of Gr.1/Gr.2/Gr.3/Gr.4 cars. Where can I race my Renault R4 or Citroen DS besides the 5,000 cr Sunday Cup?\n\n* Building from above, the depth/specificity of events was so much greater. You had all the fun one-make events that felt like side quests. You had the Polyphony Cup for purely stock cars. You had events for muscle cars, European hot hatchbacks, supercars, Boxers, Naturally aspirated cars, etc. GT7 still has some of that, but too many events are merged into the Sunday/Clubman/Classic/WTC categories.\n\n2) Add practice/qualifying in some fashion. While we're at it, bring back the \"Entry List\" from GT1 so we know how fast Gallo's Alfa Giulia GTAm is.\n\n3) Either implement standing starts (F1 style) or rolling double file starts (ACC/GT3 style). Either would be a giant improvement from the idiotic 40-second rolling start gaps.\n\n4) Focus on either Sophy or \"chili pepper\" AI for all races, with customizable difficulty that increases payouts. I believe every race in the game - GT Cup Gr.3, Lago Maggiore Human Comedy, etc. - should be winnable by any player while simultaneously rewarding the truly skilled.\n\nGoing back to GT4 - the \"A-Spec\" points, although abusable and sometimes inaccurate, provided a benchmark. If you're a newer driver, you knew to tune your car to a 10 A-Spec point race. If you're average, maybe your target is 100. The aliens will aim for 200 and above. Again, it was never a perfect stat, but it was substantially better than entering a race blindly and either destroying the competition or frustratingly getting left in the dust. This could be addressed with more specific difficulty settings.\n\n5) Better overall AI might address this, but randomize the AI so you aren't always chasing F. Portilla's Viper in every event.\n\nMost aspects is better than it has ever been in gt7 campared to past titles.\n\nThats why i mentioned the career mode and progression not part of the given improvments.\n\nYou have not even made your own suggestions for the ideal gt.\n\nI'd disagree with that sentiment to a large degree. But since you asked, I think my opinions from the linked thread apply to what an \"ideal GT\" can be. TLDR: Any new additions to GT8 will be undermined by flaws that PD seemingly can't/won't fix.\n\nWe talk about car/track additions ad nauseum, lets fix some longstanding issues.\n\nAlso, I took the time to respond to some of your suggestions.\n\nHow would you design, change (or remove entirely) the license tests?\n\nThey're perfect as is IMO, they serve their intended purpose well.\n\nHow would you design an arcade mode - all cars and tracks available instantly, or have it like Gran Turismo 4, or even Gran Turismo 3 for example?\n\nArcade mode would be the current iteration of the game in terms of physics. All cars/tracks can be available as you stated. But my big change is in the next bullet point.\n\nGT8 should have a sim mode that isn't catered/centered around the controller experience. Devote time to the wheeled peripherals that they endorse. Fully utilize or improve their laser scanning technique because as of right now, there's zero road feel compared to ACC. And I know the fanboys are gonna cry and moan about this, I'm not saying ACC is better or perfect. Check my post history if you care to, I'm consistent on that front. But I just ran the Nurburing back to back on both titles and it's not even a comparison. ACC washes GT7 as it pertains to the track itself being feeling alive. I'd like to see them lean into the sim side of things, while keeping the current level of \"sim\" for the arcade mode.\n\nThe online experience and how daily races, time trials work and perhaps other things you come up with?\n\nFirst and foremost, implement a penalty system that isn't trash.\n\nStop making us wait 2 hours between races.\n\nOther things to make the career mode in your eyes “better”?\n\nSophy alone will make the career mode a different beast, if they can realize it's potential.",

You're not max leveling the full roster in a week.\n\nWhile still faster than an mmo. That sounds boringlybtedious.

I'm not sure it actually lowers your stats.\n\nFree Roam works in a similar fashion you can get gear based on your rank if you go to the right area.\n\nBut you wont get gear above your rank fighting things above your rank.\n\nFor some reason I thought this applied to your gear stats too, lol. I haven't really done super lower quests with stronger gear to notice a difference sadly, I only do lower tier quests if a aid request pop up but usually grinding char ranks for passives so not paying too much attention to my damage.\n\nhttps://psnprofiles.com/FioreAmaya | http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/1893663/\n\nGrinding is love, grinding is life.\n\nantoinejones posted...\n\nWhile still faster than an mmo. That sounds boringlybtedious. I might hate the game repeating the same quest 1000 times to do that lol\n\nI don't think it's quite that many times, but it will be a bunch of times.\n\nEven just grinding out the first co-op quest on repeat looking hunting the cosmetics is giving me over a full Character Rank each run. With S-Rank and MVP it's close to 1.5 levels in a run. It's just more about how many times you need to wait for a stage to start, and then make sure you get the character you want, and then run it and go do it again. I'm only getting 2-3 runs an hour right now, so it all depends on how much time you have to dedicate to it I suppose.\n\nIf you have an abundance of free time and not much else to do you can probably knock out 2-3 characters to 100 in a week. But that's some serious dedication.\n\nThe amount of exp you need to rank up starts increasing past 30 for chars, so it starts taking much longer to rank up compared to the rank 1-30. Unless you're really going ham and being extremely efficient, you're not getting multiple chars to 100 in a week.\n\nAfter 30, the amount needed to rank up is 2k, not sure what rank the next increase is but I know it eventually becomes 3k to rank up after that. Boss Raids tend to give a bit more than co-op quests. Boss raids tend to range from 6.5-8.5min~ ish clear times, whereas co-op tends to range from 9-12~ ish min from my personal experience and from seeing others.\n\nIt's definitely possible to get multiple to rank 100 if you have a fair amount of free time and only do boss raids for time efficiency.\n\nThis is all based off matchmaking on Asia server since that's where the majority of players play due to the queue times/being most active.\n\nhttps://psnprofiles.com/FioreAmaya | http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/1893663/\n\nGrinding is love, grinding is life.\n\nThanks for the update.
