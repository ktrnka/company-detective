I haven't found anything quite as good as RDR2 for immersive free roaming. Titles I have enjoyed in no particular order are:\n\nWitcher 3: a little less focused on interactive free roam world but definitely lots to explore.\n\nGhost of Tsushima: again less interactive free roam but a fantastic experience (I actually preferred it over RDR2).\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn: definitely a fun game to go exploring in. I loved this despite it being a setting I traditionally don't enjoy.\n\nFar Cry 5: first person shooter with an interesting world to explore. It has many flaws, imo, but can be fun to wander about. The fishing is, imo, better than RDR2.\n\nGhost Recon Wildlands: suggesting this over the newer Breakpoint as it has a better world with the possibility of creating more intense situations.\n\nWatch Dogs 2: all three games are on ps4 but 2 in my opinion has the best map for exploration and the most potential to create interesting situations.\n\n## Comment ID h6s73ef with +12 score by [(DarkIxis, Reddit, 2021-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/h6s73ef/) (in reply to ID oszpl5):\nDays Gone is the sandbox I'm trudging through, good mechanics, decent story, and lots of exploring.

You appreciate the wildlife, the trees, the weather, the landscape and the music a lot more when you're not blazing past it at 100mph. \n\nBut that's the downside: most game companies are about providing intense action at all times. Very few games want to give the player a slow moment because those are moments that a player is likely to stop playing in. Even comparing RDR1 to RDR2 illustrates this as RDR1, fantastic as it is, plays more like a _video game_ than a _simulation_, which is the core difference in my eyes\n\n### Comment ID gsbh2i9 with +8 score by [(LexB777, Reddit, 2021-03-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbh2i9/) (in reply to ID gsb7qjk):\nReally interesting point. I had considered the slow pacing, but not the fact that you actually move and do things slower.\n\nWhen I first started the game, I found the pacing made me antsy. I kept wanting to go faster, but I *knew* that I would fall in love with this game. I played the ever living shit out of RDR1, over and over again. Same with GTA5 and Skyrim. I'm the kind of player that buys about 1 or 2 games per year.\n\nNow that I'm in the last Chapter of the whole game, I wish I had taken it even slower (even though I have 180 hours logged into the first save, not sure if that's normal but it feels like a lot). I definitely will go even slower on my second play through.\n\n#### Comment ID gsbhj5p with +4 score by [(Joss_Card, Reddit, 2021-03-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbhj5p/) (in reply to ID gsbh2i9):\nThat's what I did. I spent as much time in chapter 2 as I could, doing as much as I could before I had to move the camp.

      "# Post ID 1amz7sx: Recommendations for games like Genshin. (Single player; free roam; exploration with puzzles) with +5 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/)\nHi,\n\nDo you have any recommendations for games like Genshin Impact. I mean: single player mainly; free roaming open-world and exploration with puzzles.\n\nFrom what I know:\n\n\"Zelda Breath of the Wild\" and \"Tears of Kingdom\"\n\nImmortal Fenyx Rising\n\nWuthering Waves (not yet released but I still count it)\n\n* What I do **NOT** look for:\n\nGames mainly focused on multiplayer (example: Tower of Fantasy) (I have a bad connection, so my ping is quite bad. It's still okay when Internet is only a bit required like Genshin, but once other players are involved, I often have a lag of a few seconds)\n\nNon free-roaming games (example: Honkai Star Rail) (The puzzles often make me feel like I found a rubik's cube on the side of the road instead of the puzzle being hidden and part of the world. What I am looking for is to explore, find secrets and be rewarded for solving them; all that in a fluid way, instead of the puzzle interrupting my freedom of movement).\n\n* What make no difference for me:\n\nCombat: Combats can be action or turned based\n\nClimbing: There can be no climbing. It can even be no jumping. As long as the environment allow falling from edges to find secret (think Dark Souls. No real jumping, but you can find a lot of secrets anyway\n\nDoes anyone know of games like that?\n\nEdit: For more precision: What I am looking for is environmental puzzle; puzzle where you still control your character to solve the puzzle. Not puzzle that feels more like a minigame totally separated from the main gameplay.\n\nAnd the feeling I am looking for is: you explore the world, find a puzzle out in the wild. You try to solve it; if you can't solve it, no problem, you can just return to it later. The other puzzles aren't locked because you didn't complete the previous ones; while at the same time you find puzzles through exploring, it's not a serie of room with puzzle in each of them.\n\n## Comment ID kpphbg1 with +6 score by [(Due-Distribution-463, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpphbg1/) (in reply to ID 1amz7sx):\nFallout 4 and Skyrim are the best open world games although both are graphically out of date. There are no real puzzles in either of them which is a big plus in my book. Puzzles are too artificial.\n\nSubnautuca is a great open world game but it has no real combat or NPCs to interact with.\n\nHogwarts Legacy is similar to Genshin.\n\n### Comment ID kpqejsw with +3 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpqejsw/) (in reply to ID kpphbg1):\nExcept, I am looking for the puzzles.

Wow, I never thought about it, but *yeah*, the Tallnecks ARE puzzles, where you have to observe the terrain and the machines guarding it, then approach carefully. \n\nMany fights are also puzzles, as (unless you play on the lightest difficulty) it's best to start stealthy and go noisy only when you're not going to get attacked from four different directions. Stealth games are IMHO partly puzzle games where you're trying to solve how to move from point A to point B with a minimum of fuss. \n\nThe sequel has a LOT more puzzles, some of which I remember very fondly; climbing up a pair of overgrown skyscrapers in San Francisco or delving a ruin in the remains of Las Vegas.\n\n#### Comment ID kptrxtg with +1 score by [(Toutanus, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kptrxtg/) (in reply to ID kpphrd1):\nForbiden West has more puzzles\n\n## Comment ID kppgsqd with +5 score by [(Mar_ZP, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kppgsqd/) (in reply to ID 1amz7sx):\nI'm not sure it matches your description but I'll throw it anyways...

Oblivion and Morrowind, too.Â  Elex is essentially a double-A version of this, if you're really desperate.Â \n\n\nA bunch of open world jrpgs would match your criteria, too. Try xenoblade, modern final fantasy, etc.Â \n\n\nDark souls is even heavier on combat and lighter on puzzles than skyrim, but some are free roam. Elden ring is similar, but with much more free roam than dark souls.Â \n\n\nFallout and starfield could be stretched to meet your criteria. Puzzles are almost non existent tho.Â \n\n\nAt this point, you're running out of games. Nier and Nier Automata are less free roam than you'd like, and have no focus on puzzles.\n\n### Comment ID kpvoi0q with +3 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpvoi0q/) (in reply to ID kpqiicx):\nI am looking for these puzzles. I am looking for the type of games where you explore, then suddenly, a wild puzzle appears. If you can't solve it, you just return to it later. But the puzzle is environmental, you are still in controls of your characters. A lot of JRPG have the \"rubik's sube\" feeling: you no longer control you character, and instead control the puzzle. It's often because map movement/interaction is limited.\n\nOne of the rare exception for JRPG, is Golden Sun.

Great memories of sword only and that one bow challenge in the inazuma quest where java spent days to get around it. \n\nOfc without an audience you don't have that much of an incentive to not cheat if you're stuck but you can give you hard penalties, e.g. 1 cheat costs a 10pull on the standard banner or something like that. \n\nBut that's just if you're reeeeaaally into a challenge, otherwise it'll likely burn you out\n\n### Comment ID kpvi8lg with +2 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpvi8lg/) (in reply to ID kpr0ifs):\nI am more looking at something casual.

It's kinda free roaming but not a true open world, to open some area you have to play the story first just like genshin\n\n\nThe puzzle, well.. the puzzle is tied to the exploration.

Also, more of a crime/mystery solving than a puzzle game.\n\nGhost trick seems great, but not an open world again.\n\nI'll give Outer Wilds a try.\n\nThe type of games I am looking for is games with environmental puzzles. Using the ability/movement you have, you try to find how to solve the puzzle. Think a bit like Journey (not a lot of puzzle but it's the idea)\n\nIn Genshin, most of the puzzles involve finding clues around it, finding missing elements, ... but you are rarely stopped from controlling your character. That's what I am looking for.\n\n## Comment ID kpqsujx with +1 score by [(xenodusk, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpqsujx/) (in reply to ID 1amz7sx):\nNot sure if they're your cup of tea, but the Insomniac Spider-Man games feature an open world (or open city, should I say) filled with puzzles, battle challenges, hidden objects, etc.\n\n### Comment ID kpvlc7y with +1 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpvlc7y/) (in reply to ID kpqsujx):\nI'll give it a try.

It's not totally open world but there are several expansive areas that you can go to find stars. There are little guys you need to fight off, but no character building. There are a ton of puzzles that you can play and ditch if you want to work on other puzzles (all give you stars so that you can fight the boss and move to the next area). It's 1-2 player, more fun with a friend to play as his hat lol.\n\nI was OBSESSED with this game and I felt the same level of obsession when I started playing Genshin. I feel the same way as you and am desperately searching for something similar to Genshin with open world, character building, ideally single player, and with lots of puzzles. \n\nI saw some people talking about Outer Wilds. It has great reviews so I'm thinking about buying, but please let me know if you have tried it out yet. I'm considering buying the Zelda breath of the wild games but I prefer to use my PC than Switch bc the playstyle is easier to me.\n\nAlso, have you played Stardew Valley?

Multiplayer wasn't internet, unfortunately, and I think the game might have been old enough to have IPX as an option lol.\n\nAbsolutely my favorite campaign mode of any jet sim ever, unmatched to this day. \n\nInterestingly, the whole premise of the sim was that you could fly either the X32 or X35 (yes, this sim came out *before Lockheed won the contract* ) to compare the two, theoretically. Neither of the VTOL variants made an appearence, and the X35 did not have the modern big screen instrument panel it has today.\n\nAlso, after ejecting you could walk around and shoot things with a handgun that was terrible to aim lol. Since they didn't want to bother developing an FPS weapon, they gave the handgun Vulcan rounds!\n\nWorth a look just to see what sims could have been. DCS no longer deserves its place on the market, it's crazy all the features that could have been if a less stagnant developer hadn't been the last one standing after the crash of '09.\n\nI think you can find it for free on the abondanware market\n\n## Comment ID lcp6ukj with +2 score by [(Kazick_Fairwind, Reddit, 2024-07-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flightsim/comments/1e07rj5/free_roam_air_combat_games/lcp6ukj/) (in reply to ID 1e07rj5):\nDCS. \n\nIf you donât want super high end graphics and be part of a large scale fictional war, Aces High is good.

Itâs basically a long spread out movie with incredible story telling that comes largely from cut scenes. I will say, ignore the people who just call it a walking simulator because the âwalkingâ is quite engaging and gets more so the farther you get BUT it is still walking and just observing the landscape and your character Sam. Seeing as you struggled with RDR2 I think youâll find the high intensity action (meaning shooting and combat) even less prevalent as there is also an emphasis on stealth.\n\n#### Comment ID la1o0dq with +1 score by [(allofdarknessin1, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la1o0dq/) (in reply to ID l9z82t5):\nI wasn't a Kojima fan growing up but I think Death Stranding is a master piece.

It is the weirdest, stickiest driving system. Imagine your car is a magnet, and so are all the other cars, you aren't drawn to them persay but any collision and you see the cars smack together at higher speed than the physics would have caused them to naturally.\n\nIt's hard to explain, but it reminded me of crazy taxi or burnout without the explosions. Gta driving is mostly physics based and very different than watch dogs. That being said, in WD2 you can remote control strangers cars and cause them to drive off cliffs or into traffic, leading to some great antics.

Love it, but I can not stick to the main storyline lol. Always get wrapped up in side quests or hunting or challenges and always get burnt out - sometimes never even making it past Horseshoe Overlook.\n\nCould try Mad Max. Action gets intense, extremely satisfying hand to hand and vehicular combat. A barren and desolate open world wasteland, but teeming with life still. Only thing is that it's linear. So once you complete quests and events they're pretty much done for good. But still a great experience. Cinematics and story content can be quite appealing too.\n\nFor something simple and a little different, Lego Lord of the Rings. As a big fan of the movies and JRR Tolkien's works in general, I really enjoyed it, from beginning to end! Open world with lots to do in terms of collectivles and interactions, but also level based at it's core. I kept thinking I had finished the game and it just kept surprising me with more content lol. Also couch co-op.\n\nBatman: Arkham City did that too. Very nice amount of content concerning the main campaign and side missions. Lots of cool dialogue as you explore the city that makes it feel more immersive. Just a great game all around imo. Played it 2 or 3 times now. Or Arkham City since it includes the batmobile - which just so happens to have handling just as odd as the vehicle mechanics in Mad Max. But it can be a lot of fun and just as immersive as City imo.\n\nFEZ. Has an interesting way of navigating through the world, similar to Kirby and the Amazing Mirror in it's own right. I thinknof it as a little dopamine generator as the main task is collecting and you get a fun prompt every time you acquire one of the many collectibles placed generously around the game world. Be warned though, the game is finishable without a guide. But if you go for completion, a walkthrough is required. Another one I've returned to several times over the years.\n\nJust Cause 2 or 3? Or Saints Row IV? Vehicle mechanics aren't as finely tuned as they are in GTAV, but great game worlds to explore and follow the main objectives in. Your choice of a tropical paradise or a visually intriguing glitchy neon alien hellscape?\n\n### Comment ID la372jp with +2 score by [(tonguemyanus69420, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la372jp/) (in reply to ID l9yavzh):\nIm the same with Red Dead. 150 hours and only completed 50% of the main story.\n\nIncredible game and world.\n\n### Comment ID la0b4h8 with +1 score by [(Jhoosier, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la0b4h8/) (in reply to ID l9yavzh):\nSaint's Row, can't remember if it's 3 or 4, but it was ridiculously stupid fun driving around and causing mayhem.

Itâs an MMORPG like WoW, but (in my opinion) the story is A THOUSAND times better; itâs actually plotted out, so each expansion is a continuation of the overarching story, not just a whole new D&D-style campaign.\n\nPlus the NPCs do eventually have very tongue-in-cheek remarks about âwe know youâve saved the world several times now, but can you spare a few minutes to help with this menial task?â The game doesnât take itself too seriously (unlike WoW, which I found to be very much all-in on the fantasy RPG and pushing the âyouâre the champion of the whole universeâ kind of thing) and the developers have been reworking the game so that you can run dungeons (called Duties) with a party of NPCs instead of other players, if solo play is a little more your thing. Itâs also useful if youâre trying to level a DPS class, since the queue times can be *painful*â¦\n\nThereâs a trial version thatâs free to play up to Stormblood (the second expansion)/level 70, and if you decide you like it, you can by the complete game for like $60 and it comes with ALL the current content.\n\nTheres a new expansion dropping next week (early access actually opens this Friday) and with it will come a huge graphics update, too. Now would be a great time to give the game a shot!\n\nI also feel itâs a little more casual player friendly than WoW, since you donât get penalized for not logging in every day (WoW has dailies that can start to feel like you HAVE to do them) and all of the raid content is 100% optional. They donât lock any major story stuff behind raids, so if you arenât the type of player to do them, youâll never miss out on the full main storyline, (unlike WoW lol) but thereâs a lot of fun additional lore to benefit from if you DO like doing raids!\n\nETA: Itâs also player friendly in that you can learn any and every class on one character, so youâre *never* locked in! If you start with, say, and Archer or a Thaumaturge but decide that you donât like them/their advanced jobs of Bard and Black Mage, you can just pick up a new class on that same character. It was one of the biggest draws for me when I jumped ship from WoW to FFXIV, and I didnât even realize how much I hated being locked into one class until I had the option NOT to be lol.\n\nOne of my favorite things to do is to log in and just wander the world. I once put my headphones on, turned my UI off, and made the on-foot trek from Gridania (one of the starting cities) in the Twelveswood to Ulâdah (another starting city) in Thanalanâthen turned around and went back the same way. I turned my BGM down so it was quite soft, but had my ambient effects turned up, so I could hear things like the wind in the trees and birds chirping, and by setting myself just to *walk,* with the UI off (and toggling in and out of 1st person POV) I was able to really drink in all the scenery. Which was a really nice change of pace from being knee-deep in the storyline. :) It was one of the most relaxing experiences Iâve ever had, and I highly recommend people give it a try!\n\nYou can get it on PS4/5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Mac, and Steam.

The world is massive, there's tons of little one-off stories and things hidden around in addition to the main story. There's also a number of different game styles involved. You can explore and find new/hidden places, the mounts are impressive in their handling. Each one feels distinct and has its own uses.

Ignore literally everything else and just be an oitlaw cowboy doing whatever you want. \n\n Valhalla, I wouldn't consider a game to just wander around in. You can, but i feel its more about the story and seeking gear and mysteries. I disagree with people complaining about Valhalla being too long. It better paces the story than Odyssey does. For me, it perfectly balances the open world RPG style of the recent games with the more focused stories of the older ones, along with having the mystery glitches and rewarding item collection to unlock a piece of gear. \n\nI'm currently playing Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and having a lot of fun. Once you get access to your ikran, it opens up the map and you can easily just explore. It does follow the Far Cry style open world with tons of points of interest to visit and crafting ingredients to collect, but it feels much more organic and engaging.\n\n## Comment ID la3jc8n with +1 score by [(VBTrix, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la3jc8n/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nSea of thieves\n\n## Comment ID la3jloy with +1 score by [(MinuteScientist7254, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la3jloy/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nStarfield\n\n## Comment ID la3x7pv with +1 score by [(kplocdog, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la3x7pv/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nLotro\n\nType it in to Google\n\nWalk around \n\nBe the shire.\n\n## Comment ID la3xoay with +1 score by [(BigOlympic, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la3xoay/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nThe Division\n\n## Comment ID la41zlp with +1 score by [(illmatic2112, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la41zlp/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nIt's not super deep but during AC2 when i was done and just going around hunting down flags while listening to my music, it was a nice relaxing feeling.

Minecraft has a pokemon mod (cobblemon, not the other one) that I spent some time on recently as well and it was cool to put a fresh spin on a game that old.\nAre you open to older games? Do you have a preference on the genre or type of game?\n\nThe Forest and its sequel both have a cool quality of discovery about them, open worlds, crafting, some body horror, and pretty worlds if you enjoy woodsy terrain.\nSkyrim is an obvious choice, especially if you haven't played it with mods.\nIf you haven't played them or if it's been a long time I'd highly recommend going back to any of the Final Fantasty games between like 6-10, Tactics, or other older classics like Chrono Trigger or Legend of Dragoon. You really can't beat the worldbuilding and storytelling of some of those.\n\nIf you're looking for a more bite sized experience that's easier to pick up and put down, maybe try something like Hades, Risk of Rain 2, or Megaloot. I really enjoy games like these as palette cleansers between bigger, more time consuming or mentally engaging games, like appetizers, to shut off the brain and get lost in the \"one more run\" loop, and typically once I'm ready to put it down there's a bigger game calling my name and I'm more mentally ready to engage with it for the long haul too.\n\n## Comment ID lagn5p2 with +1 score by [(ziasaur, Reddit, 2024-06-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/lagn5p2/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nI liked Zelda: breath of the wild because you could sneak up on monster packs and theyâd be kinda vibing and goofing off until they noticed you :D\n\n## Comment ID lagvmf6 with +1 score by [(ToastyPillowsack, Reddit, 2024-06-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/lagvmf6/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nThe Assassin's Creed games revolving around Ezio (2, Brotherhood, and Revelations) are pretty great imo.

The higher the Elo the harder it is for a mid roam to work.\n\nYet in Wildrift, it works every time. Roaming works because people lack the basic fundamentals of map awareness. Not every champion in mid can roam. If side lanes can react to roams and their mid didn't move mid that means they won the trade super hard. \n\nObviously to climb you have to adapt. So I find myself roaming even though I know it's the wrong decision. I do the same on PC when I'm playing in lower Elo.

Sometimes, the Mid-Laner has no choice but to let the invade happen, or maybe they're just dumb and don't understand the matchup. Wild Rift is very young, so most people don't have every bit of knowledge unlocked.\n\nNow, don't argue that you've played LoL PC before, I did too, but there are several nuances that are different in this and that. We have no starter items, no potions, but we have honeyfruit in the lane, the lane is shorter, etc. The macro concepts are similar, but it's still a different experience than in PC.\n\nIs this an excuse for the people who don't know Macro? No, I've beaten challengers by applying Macro several times before, and when I'm negligent about macro and the enemy team knows how to, I will lose even to Emerald players. But we haven't perfected Wild Rift the same way that we've perfected the art of PC, it may take a few more years before we see WR Challengers have the same skill as PC Challengers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THIS IS WHERE THE ACTUAL EXPLANATION BEGINS**\n\n \n\nThere are several reasons why Mid-Lane just can't come over to help you, but the two I want to talk about is Priority/Lane State, and Matchup.\n\nPriority and Lane State - Picture this, you're a ranged Mid-Laner vs an assassin, who do you think gets priority in this lane? 9 times out of 10, you should have total control of the wave if you're playing it properly. Every time he steps up or goes for CS, he should lose his HP for being so disrespectful. In this lane, you have priority, and the lane state should be pushing into him, now let's transition to the next concept.\n\nMatchup - Picture this, you're a Lee Sin vs. Evelynn, and your Mid-Laner is Orianna vs Akali. No one is level 5 yet. Now, Orianna has Akali pinned down under tower, she's shutting down any attempts she makes and she's forced to be stuck under tower until 5. \n\nBut let's reverse the roles for a moment. You're now Evelynn, your Akali is stuck under tower, she has a big cannon wave to collect, and you're here dueling LEE SIN of all people for scuttle. You see Orianna coming over to help Lee beat you up until you see grey. You should've conceded earlier, but you need to leave NOW. You don't. You die, and there's nothing Akali could've done for you there. You need to pay attention to the matchup, you shouldn't even show your face to Lee Sin at all, and Orianna is a ranged champion vs Akali in early game, you shouldn't expect anything to happen cause she can't do anything. Just because your Mid-Laner didn't come to help you, doesn't mean she's stupid, the circumstances just didn't allow her to do anything about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow all of those things I told you about? Don't forget them, they're important, but your Mid-Laner just wasn't paying attention to the map at all LMAO.\n\n## Comment ID hr12ii9 with +21 score by [(RefanRes, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr12ii9/) (in reply to ID rur90t):\nSome champs in mid arent that good at roaming.

Roaming is matchup reliant. There is absolutely no point in let's say a Ziggs following an Ahri in to the river. Some champs are build to roam, and some aren't. It's up to the rest of the team to identify that and acknowledge that if enemy mid is off the map then play safer, because your mid doesn't have as much agency. \n\nNot that a ziggs should never roam, but by design, the champion is better at sieging than roaming for kills. Othe thing to consider is 2v2 matchup. If you're expecting your mid to rotate, when you're Evelyn and Lee Sin and for example a zed rotate and you're expecting your Kayle mid to come help. Yes people troll when not roaming when they should, but also people troll just as much taking skirmishes when they have no idea how the 2v2 matchup *should* work. - then blame mid for not rotating.\n\n### Comment ID hr5eoyp with +1 score by [(BlitzBlotz, Reddit, 2022-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr5eoyp/) (in reply to ID hr1z8g7):\n>There is absolutely no point in let's say a Ziggs following an Ahri in to the river.\n\nDepending on the situation you should clear the wave which shouldnt take more than 2/3 sec for ziggs and than follow ahri through your jungle, not river to the lane she tries to gank so you can ult into the gank if necessary.\n\nI see so many Ziggs players not utilizing his almost global presence properly.\n\n#### Comment ID hr77n61 with +1 score by [(Awwbelt, Reddit, 2022-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr77n61/) (in reply to ID hr5eoyp):\nAgree maybe walk to *your red buff* and use Ur ult as support damage. Then more than likely return to mid and attempt to take plates and deny waves. You will more than likely lose a 3v3 as ziggs - because he's suited to siege. Not roam. Nothing you have said counters my point, and in fact you agree ziggs shouldn't walk down river with Ahri. \n\nThat alone gives Ahri time to gank while I'm still walking through my jungle. Ziggs isn't a roamer. Ori isnt a roamer. Some champs want to deny waves instead. If it's ziggs Vs kat, and kat keeps roaming bot for double kills - that's not mid diff, that's bot diff.\n\n## Comment ID hr24e26 with +7 score by [(Sgrinfio, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr24e26/) (in reply to ID rur90t):\nI find the opposite quite common lol.

TF however can roam even though he's not a strong early game champ because he can teleport. Galio is also a roaming mid because he's pretty good early and has teleport. Assassins should try to win lane and roam whenever possible because they have mobility to move quickly to other lanes or escape from enemy jungler when caught, need kills to snowball, and are usually quite strong in the early game.\n\nMy experience being a midlane Orianna main for the last two seasons is that when I roam too much, my gold advantage just disappears even though my jungler helped me get first blood. So when I face a relatively equal matchup, I rarely roam unless a fight around neutral objectives is happening, or I am very certain that I can get a kill or help my teammates get a kill when roaming (enemy laners are very low on hp, skills on cooldown, overpush, enemy jungler is in the opposite lane, laners/jungler are ready to skirmish, etc.)\n\n## Comment ID hr208a3 with +2 score by [(BLAST_V, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr208a3/) (in reply to ID rur90t):\nIts mostly lane priority\n\n## Comment ID hr1818o with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr1818o/) (in reply to ID rur90t):\nI only roam after t1 mid is down.

It took me forever to learn when I should break away from the lane structure that the game enforces upon everyone and move around the map more freely. In defense of my past self, successful roaming requires quite a bit of planning and nuance, so my goal for this guide is to help explain that nuance in simple terms.\n\nGuide Link: https://dignitas.gg/articles/roam-sweet-roam-an-explanation-of-roaming-in-league-of-legends\n\nIn short, I detail what criteria should be met before you choose to roam (lane states, jungler locations, etc), and what the actual benefits of roaming are for yourself and your team. For anyone actually looking to try out my advice in game, I also go over some different types of roaming (from mid, from support, from top) with example champions so that you can test out the ideas that I put forth in my article.\n\nAnyway, best of luck, and I hope this guide helps you win more games!\n\n## Comment ID gxmfz6x with +7 score by [(mipin5, Reddit, 2021-05-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/n98mgh/i_made_a_guide_about_when_to_roam_and_why_roaming/gxmfz6x/) (in reply to ID n98mgh):\nGreat guide, concise and easy enough to understand.

If Iâm pushed in to enemy turret and I see my midlander looking to make a play/has prio oftentimes Iâll coordinate a roam with them. \n\nSometimes I full roam but usually I say âI can ult mid if u want to fightâ and walk up halfway to river into ult range and ult them right after your mid engages. Your ult is so good in this situation because itâs unavoidable and if the 1v1 is even it will let you midlander win every-time with the bonus 300-400 dmg. Free assist everytime and your midlander gets ahead. \n\nOf course if your mid is behind this wonât help much and a full roam with support might be needed but thatâs more rare imo.\n\nEdit: also since youâre only roaming up halfway you usually lose like 1 minion for it and youâre not putting yourself at risk assuming you have decent warding.\n\n#### Comment ID gxtisfe with +1 score by [(elevensupernova, Reddit, 2021-05-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/n98mgh/i_made_a_guide_about_when_to_roam_and_why_roaming/gxtisfe/) (in reply to ID gxr7vda):\nThank you!

Itâs gotten a lot of hate. Itâs just as fun as the first two. Itâs a super cop game where you can jump real high, blow shit up, throw cars and objects and people around, wing suit every where, drive suped up cars and do crazy jumps and all that shit. \n\nThe great thing is, if you donât want to play the game for him and beat it, thereâs a mode called âKeys To The Cityâ or something along those lines. \n\nBasically itâs a mode where you can spawn in any object from the game, like deck him out with all weapons; you can max level the character instantly so he has the highest jumps and is the strongest. Spawn any vehicle, enemies, bosses (I think bosses not sure). Basically just a big ass chest playground. Enable god mode, enable a jet pack, bunch of more of the wacky weapons. Super super flexible and when you start it everything from the main game is completable here. You can go through the whole game with god mode enabled, best weapons, find all the power ups, and all that. \n\nItâs gunplay is lock on based so he doesnât need to be super accurate. \n\nI would say if he likes open world, this is the game to choose. Letâs him go through the story basically in easy mode if he wants, and just go around knocking off objectives or fucking around too.\n\n## Comment ID jvckape with +1 score by [(VQ_Sal, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvckape/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nRed Dead redemption 2, if he wants to be a cowboy\n\n## Comment ID jvckczl with +1 score by [(lordnyrox, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvckczl/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nRDR2\n\n## Comment ID jvckkd1 with +1 score by [(SpicyNoodlez1, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvckkd1/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nThere's alot of better games then gta that's like it, cyberpunk, red dead 2\n\n## Comment ID jvcklfk with +1 score by [(TheLewisIs_REAL, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvcklfk/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nNever played cyberpunk but from clips it gives me GTA vibes so maybee that\n\n## Comment ID jvcoofk with +1 score by [(Pvzlife, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvcoofk/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nMaybe something like fallout or Skyrim?\n\n## Comment ID jvcpegt with +1 score by [(UltraToaster, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvcpegt/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nA little older now but Prototype 1 and 2 are both games that you can just roam for hours being an unbeatable god doing whatever you want, especially if you've finished the campaign and want to let him roam around.\n\n## Comment ID jvcu8bn with +1 score by [(NomadSoul22, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvcu8bn/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nKatamari is not like those games but i think that could work\n\n## Comment ID jvcxpk3 with +1 score by [(Kell-ah, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvcxpk3/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nJust Die Already is a good one\n\n## Comment ID jvd0ps8 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvd0ps8/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nPressure washer simulator\n\n## Comment ID jvd2ji8 with +1 score by [(PoshEwok, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvd2ji8/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nWatch dogs 2?

Forza Horizon 5. Hear me out on this one:\n- It's on a game pass.\n- You can just free roam on the map to fully cover all the roads. For two days straight I was busy just riding across all the map to get all roads covered (they turn white and red instead of grey) and also picking up some XP banners - no need to interact with anything at all and you can't die or fail.\n- Tons of difficulty customization - if he is capable of initiating races of course, then that might come handy.\n- it has an option to always progress in a story no matter your results - if he will go for story.\n- It has rewind feature if for ex. you would mess up a corner.\n- It has option when car in races basically DRIVES ITSELF, only gas input is required.\n2. Crackdown 3 on Game Pass (maybe also 1 and 2, they are free). It has a ton of collectible orbs, like 800 or 900, collecting them make you stronger, surviving is easier than in GTA, you basically a superman from the get go.

Iâm (un-)sure there are ways to reduce the difficulty of steering, turning left and right, braking, following the drive path, etc.\n\nCars can be painted in custom colors and fitted with *really* cool looking custom liveries.

Legion however has some brilliant accessibility features, so it's definitely worth a look. WD1 has less of a fuck aroundability compared to 2 or Legion, but it's good none the less\n\nI also find modded fallout 4 with a few mods to remove maybe the main quests or give you an alternate start a really good screw around game. Obviously it's an FPS but there is a third person mode. Throw a few fucky mods in there and you could make a really fun game just for running around, killing people and looting their bodies, and exploring. Skyrim is the same story really, but the fantasy aspect makes it more reliant on books and text rather than fallout 4 holotapes for a lot of the environmental narrative.\n\nActually, Fallout 76 might be really good. The game has a really accepting, kind community, a completely ignorable main questline and the entire structure is basically jump from event to event to kill things and keep yourself occupied. It's pretty hard resource wise at the start though so that's worth considering.\n\nIdk much about Red Faction because the last time I played it I was like 6, but Red Faction Guerilla is open world and basically just about destroying stuff, with a hammer, because most of the world is destroyable. Might be a good idea, same with the Just Cause franchise. \n\nI'd never normally recommend the Saints Row spinoff Agents Of Mayhem but it's a good third person fuck around game too. \n\nIn a similar vain, Sunset Overdrive. Although, it does somewhat punish you for just fucking around as you will run out of ammo and get swarmed by thousands, and the movement can be really a little complex at times, but it's fun, flashy and has a banging soundtrack. Doesn't take itself seriously at all and it worth a look on YouTube maybe. \n\nYou know what else might be good if you push through the prologue a bit, or even get to the final phase of the game? Red Dead 2, or Red Dead Online. Its really not the worst for just running around and blasting people.\n\n## Comment ID jvdtsb9 with +1 score by [(tirednotepad, Reddit, 2023-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvdtsb9/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nRead dead redemption 1 & 2, fallout, Witcher, mafia 1,2, & 3, Zelda on switch, Jedi fallen order (you can replay the levels and enemies repopulate after you rest), assasins creed, mass effect.

      "# [A Weekend Guide To Scarborough And The Yorkshire Coast Of England â ROAM WHERE by Rachel Boyles on 2023-03-08](https://www.roamwhere.com/blog/a-weekend-in-scarborough-the-yorkshire-coast-of-england)\nWhy Visit Scarborough And The English Coast\n\nFish and chips. Ice cream. 2 penny slots. Coastal hikes. Lighthouses. Just a few of my favorite things every time we go to the seaside.\n\nWhen I told a few friends from London that I was going to Scarborough for the first few days of the New Year they asked why there. The question caught me off guard, but then it reminded me that just because my family is familiar with an area doesn't mean others are. England has 7,000 miles of coastline, so every region in the country will have the seaside town they're closest to or most likely to visit. Scarborough and the surrounding northeast coast is where my husband's family spends most of their seaside time because the area is quaint, nature-filled, and only a few hourâs drive.\n\nIf you're visiting England for a week, it's easy to have a full itinerary, but time by the sea is special and gives you a glimpse into English seaside culture. From super cute, charming towns with fish and chips and antique shops to long swaths of beach and coastline to hike up and down, it would be a miss not to visit. This post specifically focuses on Scarborough and the surrounding Yorkshire area, but don't let that limit you! If you only have a short amount of time, seek out the coast closest to you and use this post for inspiration of things you can do, because many of these activities aren't unique to Scarborough. That said if you fall in love with the views in the photos, and you have the time, Scarborough is one hundred percent worth your time.\n\nWhen To Visit The English Seaside\n\nOf course, summer is the most popular time because you have a chance at warmer temperatures for sunbathing and maybe even a brave chilly swim, but any time of the year can be a good time to visit. Most times we've visited the seaside have been solely chosen because we've visited family. And more often than not, we're visiting for the holidays in the winter, so I've had my fair share of winter seaside days. No matter the weather, whether it's rainy and cold or sunny and breezy, I've enjoyed every visit.\n\nThis most recent seaside escape took us to Scarborough. Every time I visit my husband's family, they always try to take me somewhere new to me but familiar to them. In past visits, we made it to Whitby, Robin Hood's Bay, and Staithes, and somehow I hadn't made my way to Scarborough yet. Since we were looking for a base for a few dayâs visit versus just a day trip, it was the perfect option with lots to do. We visited the first few days of the new year with the hopes of \"clearing out the cobwebs\" (as my father-in-law likes to say) with fresh sea air and nature views.\n\nWhat To Do When Visiting Scarborough\n\nExplore The Harbor And Seafront\n\nWe spent most of our time in Scarborough walking along the seafront of the South Harbor. It's the main location for restaurants, games to play, and beach walks. On our first day, we started at the St. Mary's carpark and walked the half-mile path past the Scarborough castle and down to South Beach Bay. You get a good view of the sea and the town while also admiring the castle walls. Once at the Bay, we walked down the boardwalk along the beach and then came back along the other side of the road to look over the shops and restaurants.\n\nWe visited over the winter holidays, and it was a bright sunny day, so the beach was packed with people. We realized we weren't the only ones who thought being by the water would be a great way to start the New Year. Even with the masses, I was still enthralled with it. There is just something so uniquely distinctive about UK seaside culture, and Scarborough has it all. Full families walking along the waterfront together, everyone with either fish and chips or ice cream, bundled up in coats and hats, all in front of a backdrop of bright signs, tourist shops, and the waves crashing in the distance.\n\nOn each of the two nights we stayed in Scarborough, we also came down to walk along the harbor. The harbor front is also home to many 'casinos'(?) with 2p slots (more on that below), so that was also our evening entertainment.\n\nAll of this to say, it's the thing to do in the place. Just go for a walk and observe at the very least.\n\nPlay 2p Slots\n\nI can't write this post without talking about 2p slots. If you're from the UK, you most likely don't need an explanation. But as an American, I find them unique, almost perplexing, but also incredibly fun and addictive. Basically, they have games that cost a 2 penny coin to play. For most machines, as you and others play, the 2p coins pile up in the machine. The goal is to knock a jackpot worth of coins or some small trinket into a hole below so you can collect it. A jackpot worth of coins is what I always dream of, but I'm not sure if anyone has won more than Â£1 (= 50 x 2p coins) in one go from these games. And the trinkets are usually things like little animal figurines or whatever the new cheap trendy toy is. (This time the toy in fashion was the push pop keychains, but I could imagine a past where Tamagotchis were on offer.)\n\n2p slot 'casinos' offer a lot of fun for Â£1. You can search for the machine that looks the most primed, try out what you think is the perfect angle that will win them all, and even attempt different techniques like pushing in a lot of coins all at once or doing them one at a time. Each time we would win a trinket, we would comment on how if we bought it ourselves it would be much cheaper than what we spent winning it, but it's the journey, not the destination.\n\nWhat makes these so peculiar to me is that they're basically lightweight gambling. I felt myself thinking if I just play one more pound I'll crack this machine and get a windfall, but as I said, I'm not sure if that ever happens. But that 1% of hope keeps me coming back and trying again. Even worse, the real deal slot machines are just beyond an 18 or older line on the ground. Signaling once you're old enough, you can play for bigger money.\n\nAnyways, they're (or at least can be) cheap fun and signify a day at the seaside. Enjoy yourself but go in with a budget of Â£5 or so and keep your wits about you.\n\nGet Fish And Chips\n\nWhere To Walk And Hike / What To Do / What To See In The Area Around Scarborough\n\nThis section wasn't easy to title, because visiting the seaside is often a âchoose your own adventureâ. Looking to walk through a quaint coastal village? They have that. What about a rugged coastline with lots of hiking paths? They have that too. Or what about a wooded hike inland? Yup, there's also that. At each of these places, you can take it at your own pace and explore it the way you want to best.\n\nVisit Flamborough Head\n\nI was blown away by this place. I don't know if it was because I had experienced withdrawals from not traveling and exploring somewhere new, or if really it is that impressive, but I thought it was beautiful. Ultimately, I didn't know what to expect, but it's like a smaller version of the White Cliffs of Dover. In other seaside visits, usually, we're in the harbor so I don't see the rugged coastline as much, so I think that's why this surprised me so much.\n\nIt has easy and ample parking up by the lighthouse. From there, you can hike down to the water and walk around the base of the chalk cliffs and along the rocky beach as you explore the cavernous areas. You can also walk along the top of the cliffs and look at the rolling green meadows ahead and the water crashing below. Even better, we came upon a bay full of seals. We were looking down at them from above, but it was fun to stumble upon them. I also JUST read while working on this post that you can spot puffins from mid-May to July. I might have to return just for that!\n\nA quick disclaimer on tide times\n\nWhen visiting the coast, it's important to keep an eye on the tidal schedule, because, in most locations, the beach is completely covered by a few feet of water during high tide.\n\nA tidal win: We visited Flamborough Head at the perfect time because we were able to explore a large part of the beach and even explore more corners of it by walking around rocks. Not even 30 minutes after we were there, the path around the rocks had waves covering the path. And an hour or two later, the beach would not have been accessible.\n\nA tidal loss: We planned to visit Filey on our way back to Scarborough from Flamborough Head. It made sense logistically, but we didn't watch the tidal schedule. We parked where the family normally parks, which gives you a nice walk along the water into town. Well, we walk down to the beach and end up seeing the water coming all of the way into one of the areas that juts out before we get onto the beach. We contemplated and watched others make attempts. A family on their walk back from town filled their boots with water and a woman got muddy climbing up and over. So we decided against it and went the longer route up and around.\n\nFalling Foss / Foss Falls\n\nThis destination takes you inland, so it's a nice contrast to all of the time near the water. Because it's off the beaten path, it's definitely an adventure. We chose it based on a recommendation from my sister-in-law who had hiked it before. When she came the first time, the path she took was challenging, so this time we searched out a slightly easier path. Slightly is the keyword here, but no matter the difficulty level, it made for a fun family bonding experience. Most of us got mud on us some way or another.\n\nWe started the path by looking down at the waterfall from above, and then we took the long path walking away from the falls for quite a while. We started to zig zag our way back and down to the floor of the waterfall. At the point we reached the stream, we could hear the waterfall but we couldn't see it. This is where things got a little confusing. We tried crossing over the stream and then walking along it, but the path took us away from the falls again. So we scrambled our way back down to the stream, off trail, and then had to find an area of stones or a fallen tree to cross back over. All of that to say we had a fantastic time, spent the afternoon out in the forest, and overcame many hurdles we thought would stop us along the way. The falls are beautiful, and I bet it's fun to take a swim when it's warm in the summer.\n\nThese next three destinations I've visited on other trips to the UK, but they're nearby Scarborough and so worth exploring:\n\nRobin Hoods Bay\n\nSpeaking of quaint villages, this is definitely one, if you can't tell by the name. It's built into the fissure of two hills with winding cobble stone alleyways and sandstone houses. It's a fun walk down to the sea and then you can explore along the beach. We went here a few years back, but it was my first time seeing this coast, and this particular area really stuck in my heart and mind.\n\nWhitby\n\nOne of the more famous stops along the coast, Whitby is known for the remains of the once-large Whitby Abbey as well as the home to Bram Stoker while he wrote Dracula. Whitby has a decent size city center with lots of shops and restaurants to explore. It's very picturesque because it's split by the River Esk which flows into the North Sea, and on either side of the bridge you get a great view of the city, full of brick and stone buildings with their red roofs. This is a fantastic place to stop for fish and chips. We usually get ours at Mister Chips by the beach and eat it outside at the gazebo. As a reminder, keep an eye out for seagulls (they will swoop down and take a whole tray of chips from you). My other favorite stop in Whitby is to get a cup of tea from the tea stall. You can get it in a real mug while you observe the city across the water. Super cute and very English.\n\nStaithes\n\nA much smaller village to visit, in my mind I think of it similar to Robin Hood's Bay. When we visited, we walked through town, by the bay, and along the breakwater. It has lovely views of cliffs that create a nice sheltered harbor that contributed to it becoming a village.\n\nWhere To Eat In Scarborough",
      "# [Wahoo ACE Cycling GPS In-Depth Review: The Best or Unbaked? by Ray Maker on 2024-12-03](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/12/wahoo-elemnt-ace-in-depth-review-bike-computer.html)\nAfter years of waiting, weâve finally got a new Wahoo cycling GPS â and itâs a beast. At least, in terms of size and weight. And in the future, Wahoo also hopes in terms of features and position in the market. The new unit sports a full color touchscreen display, roughly similar to that of cell phones, while also including a speaker, bike-bell, and wind sensor. Of course, like other high-end bike computers introduced this year, it also includes a much higher price tag â $599USD.\n\nUnfortunately, to spoil this review â itâs half-baked. Itâs missing a vast array of features that previously existed on every other Wahoo bike computer to date, itâs even missing features listed on the front of the box and marketing site, and the battery life falls far short of claims. Iâd argue this is the perfect product to see which reviewers are actually riding with it, versus just taking pretty shots of it.\n\nBut, weâre getting ahead of ourselves here. Iâve been riding the crap out of it, everything from near-daily 3-4 hour rides, to mountain biking, structured workouts, gravel riding, and more. All with the goal of figuring out what actually works.\n\nFinally, note that this unit is a media loaner, and once this review is complete, it will go back to Wahoo. As always, I donât accept advertising from any company I review â so, if you found this review useful, consider becoming a DCR Supporter, which gets you an ad-free site, plus the behind-the-scenes video series between both myself (and my wife) on everything that happens in the DCR Sports Tech Cave/universe.\n\nHow it Differs:\n\nIn some ways, itâs hard to compare a watermelon to a kiwi, as thatâs roughly what itâs like comparing the Wahoo ACE to a Wahoo ROAM. So yes, while both are fruit (bike computers), beyond that, they are actually quite a bit different â both good and bad. Still, assuming the standard Wahoo bike computer as a baseline (which is a massive assumption as youâll see), here are the most notable differences:\n\nâ Increased size of unit a cargo-ship-sized boatload\n\nâ Increased screen size to 3.8â (2.7â on ROAM V2)\n\nâ Increased screen colors to 16 million (64 colors on ROAM V2)\n\nâ Added touchscreen capability\n\nâ Added a very loud bike bell (digital)\n\nâ Added voice navigation prompts\n\nâ Added wind sensor\n\nâ Added new sensor pairing dashboard\n\nâ Added map layers option\n\nâ Added street names on maps to (some) streets\n\nâ Added Activity Profiles (e.g., Road/MTB/etcâ¦)\n\nâ Added time to upper edge, and always-on/seen\n\nâ Revamped âReady to Rideâ dashboard\n\nâ Changed to Wahoo App (from Wahoo ELEMNT App)\n\nâ Changed a ton of the user interface\n\nâ No more lights/LEDs along upper edge\n\nâ No Live Tracking yet (firmware update in H1 2025)\n\nâ No Strava Live Segments yet (firmware update in H1 2025)\n\nâ No more full-route elevation view (coming in TBD update)\n\nâ No more filtering of routes on device (coming in TBD update)\n\nâ No more naming of saved locations (coming in TBD update)\n\nâ No more custom alerts (e.g., hydration/nutrition alerts, coming in update)\n\nâ No more choosing location on Wahoo App map to route to (only device)\n\nâ No more changing gear ratios (electronic shifting) in new Wahoo app\n\nâ No nacho cheese dispenser\n\nâ No TrainerRoad Outside Workouts at present (âcoming soonâ)\n\nâ Increased battery life claim to 30 hours (Note: This isnât even vaguely close to real, as Iâll show)\n\nâ Increased internal storage from 32GB to 64GB (for maps)\n\nâ Included new aluminum mount (versus plastic previously)\n\nâ Removed screw for bike computer to mount (allowed UCI Pro teams to count unit weight as bike weight)\n\nâ Price is $599USD/$849CAD/â¬599EUR/Â£549GBP/$999AUD/Â¥99,000JPY\n\nNow, when it comes to features that are in the pipeline, Wahoo has confirmed some of them, per the table below, though, many of the ones listed above donât have exact dates yet.\n\nThe first set is these updates not in the 2025 table:\n\nâPlanned December 2024 Updates. A post launch update will take place in December. This update will include the following features below:\n\nâ Strava Live Segments\n\nâ Offline configuration support (to supplement cloud based architecture)\n\nâ âWorkout Profilesâ rebrand to âActivity Profilesâ\n\nâ Additional UI/UX Refinement and bug fixesâ\n\nAnd then the second category is this, for H1 2025 and H2 2025.\n\nFor example, language support includes focusing on French, German, Spanish, and then the remaining 14 languages Wahoo currently supports. Today, itâs only English on the ACE. For advanced route management, thatâs allowing you to ride routes on a trainer, while showing the virtual route location on your map on the ACE.\n\nIn the case of the battery optimizations, theyâre aiming to strike a better balance between the 5-second timeout mode, and the Auto mode, basically in hopes of getting the battery life better within Auto, versus the only way to get good battery life today is 5-second mode (more on that later).\n\nFor H2, theyâre looking at additional map layers such as custom POIs from Strava or Komoot, as well as some functions around the wind sensor, including breaking out how much power is required to overcome the grade (on a climb, steep or otherwise) vs wind (which might help on positioning). These are all certainly interesting ideas. Though, I fear some of these aspirations could become derailed with trying to get all the existing features ported first, before they can focus on new items.\n\nSo with that, letâs get into the box.\n\nIn the Box:\n\nFirst up weâll quickly get the unit unboxed. Inside, youâll find the ACE just chilling:\n\nBut hereâs whatâs inside the box once you get rid of all the paper. Kudos to Wahoo in that thereâs no plastic in the box.\n\nInside youâve got:\n\nâ The beefcake of a bike computer (ACE)\n\nâ The beefcake of a metal mount\n\nâ The lanyard to tether the ACE in case it snaps the mount\n\nâ The USB-C cable to charge it\n\nâ A warranty paper youâll never read.\n\nHereâs a few close-up shots of all those things.\n\nOk, letâs get into the size. Or, over the size. Or, wrap ourselves around the size.\n\nThe Size:\n\nLike it or not, the size is going to be a polarizing aspect of the Wahoo ACE. And itâs near impossible to understand in photos. Itâs not really due to any singular dimension, but rather, the complete girthiness of it. Itâs a tank in all ways.\n\nOfficially it measures 208g on the scale, but itâs mostly the thickness and width youâll notice. Hereâs how it looks side-by-side:\n\nThe thing is, Iâm a unique duck here. Iâm used to all assortment of stupid-large things on my handlebars for testing, including drone remote controls and more. So frankly, the size actually doesnât bother me. Neither does the weight.\n\nHowever, itâs impossible not to notice it. Itâs huge. Wahoo says much of the size is to account for the larger battery, which in turn provides it with a claimed 30 hours of battery life (a number I canât get *anywhere near* in my testing).\n\nWhen it comes to mounts, it has much the same problem as the Edge 1050 did at launch â it needs an XL mount of some sort. In Wahooâs case though, thatâs actually twofold. First, it needs a strong (realistically metal) mount to support the much heavier weight. Very heavy, so heavy in fact that Wahoo is specifically not designing a GoPro adapter for the bottom of their mount because the combined weight will likely snap it (after hitting a pothole or cobbles).\n\nHereâs their stock mount on my mountain bike:\n\nThe second piece is the length. It needs to be long enough to handle that, which is longer than the Edge 1050, but because the mount is centered differently than the Edge 1050, it can squeeze into most Edge 1050 compatible mounts. But barely. In the case of my Canyon bike with the stock Canyon out-front mounts, it basically skids (physically touches) across the handlebar as I rotate inwards:\n\nBut it does get in there, after snuggling. And that particular mount is designed to support a light on the bottom, so itâs used to the weight. Though, I havenât tried it with both Wahoo ACE + Light to see if itâll snap. Hereâs to hoping it doesnât.\n\nThe point is, this will be frustrating for some users (actually, many users) who want to mount a GoPro or other action camera below. The combined weight is simply well beyond what any mount on the market today is going to safely handle (Iâve snapped metal mounts with far less weight on them). Hopefully weâll see some viable Ace+GoPro mounts soon. After all, Wahoo does have GoPro action cam control on the unit.\n\nRiding Basics:\n\nProbably the first thing youâll need to know is now youâll be using Wahooâs new bike computer app on your smartphone, simply called âWahooâ. Previously with their bike computers, you used the Wahoo ELEMNT app. But over the last year or two, Wahooâs been slowly moving devices under the consolidated Wahoo App instead. At a high level, this works. But if youâre a long-time Wahoo user, youâll quickly find the gaps for which there are no solutions.\n\nWithin the Wahoo app, youâll pair up the Wahoo ACE, as well as link any partner accounts you have, like Strava, TrainingPeaks, or Komoot. However, the list is a bit messy right now. A number of the existing Wahoo partners arenât working in the new Wahoo app/platform, which is required for the ACE.\n\nFurther, one thing thatâs rather silly, is that by default, it wonât automatically upload your completed activities to each of these platforms. You have to expand out the box and check âAuto-Shareâ. Why?!? So much why.\n\nWithin the Wahoo app, you can set up heart rate zone, and power zones (plus bits like metric/imperial/custom display of measurements).\n\nNext, this is the first Wahoo cycling computer to support sport/bike profiles, such as creating a set of data pages for road cycling, and a different one for mountain biking. To do so, youâll open the Wahoo app, and then select to âAdd Workout Profileâ. Here youâll choose something within the âCyclingâ category, in order to get it to show up on the ACE:\n\nHere Iâve created a Mountain Biking profile, where I can then configure workout pages, alerts, general settings (such as Auto Lap), as well as heart rate zones:\n\nWhen it comes to workout data pages, thereâs a boatload of options as before, both in terms of custom data fields, as well as dedicated pages like Music Control, GoPro Control, and Strava Live Segments (when that feature gets rolled out in a few months).\n\nAnd, because someone in the comments section got really angry that I didnât show how many data fields the map page can display, here ya go, all the data fields â including the elevation data field at the bottom, and wind on the side.\n\nOnce youâve got all that configured, you can then select it at the top of your ACE:\n\nAfter which, all of your data pages/settings/etc will be available for that ride.\n\nBut hereâs the (extremely annoying) rub: This wonât correctly tag the ride type on Strava or other platforms upon upload. The *singular* feature that people have been asking for, for countless years, Wahoo hasnât completed. Thus everything is listed on Strava as a generic ride, unless you go on Strava and manually toggle it to Mountain Bike, Gravel, etcâ¦\n\nWahoo says that adding in the correct sub-type is on their near-term radar, but they donât have a timeframe for it. Keeping in mind, this is literally just a single field in the .FIT file they have to set.\n\nNow, one of the things youâll notice is the new sensor pairing menu at the bottom. This shows your paired sensors, and whether or not theyâre connected. It even has nifty-proper icons for each of them.\n\nIn fact, kudos to Wahoo here. Not only did they make picture-perfect icons for all their own devices (e.g. Wahoo POWRLINK Zero power meter pedals look like Wahoo speedplay pedals), but they also did it for at least some other power meters. For example, the Garmin Rally pedals look roughly like Garmin Rally pedals. Quarq cranksets and Favero power pedals just look like generic crank arms. Still, well done Wahoo.\n\nWhen it comes to shifting, you can pair up both ANT+ Shifting (e.g. SRAM eTAP/AXS) as well as Shimano Di2. In the case of both, you can use the remote shifter buttons to change data pages or set a lap marker. However, at present the new Wahoo App doesnât support customizing gear ratios like the Wahoo ELEMNT app did.\n\nNow, that said, I will note that it seems to take a little longer than Iâd like to find sensors sometimes. Not a huge deal, but itâs not quite as instant as Wahooâs other devices or Garmin/Hammerhead. Sometimes itâs more like 20-30 seconds before it seems to notice its sensor friends are awake.\n\nStill, once it finds it, Iâve had zero issues on all my rides across numerous bikes, including: SRAM AXS RED XPLR (and FORCE AXS), Shimano Di2, Quarq power meters, Favero Assioma MX power meter, Garmin Rally power meter, Wahoo TRACKR heart rate sensor, Garmin HRM-PRO Plus HR sensor, and Garmin Varia RTL-515 radar.\n\nSo with all that configured, letâs go and ride. Again, Iâll cover navigation later on. As you ride, youâll see your data pages automatically displayed. You can swipe through them using your fingers, or press the page button:\n\nYouâll notice above the coloring for my heart rate and wattage, this is based on my zones. Itâs a nice touch that Wahoo has, and also appears in other fields, like gradient.\n\nWahoo also has the concept of increasing/decreasing data field quantities. Meaning, by simply pressing the up/down buttons (on the right side), itâll change how many data fields are displayed on the page, per the priority you set on the app. As you do this, itâll change how big each field is. Such as below:\n\nNote that while Wahoo got rid of the LED bar seen on past Wahoo computers, it does retain much of that same concept through colorized data fields and a strip that updates at the top of the screen. Further, I appreciate always having the time displayed at the top of the screen, no matter what data page youâre on. They also use that area to display upcoming turns (albeit, kinda late usually).\n\nNext, regardless of whether you have a route enabled or not, youâll automatically get upcoming climb information. As you approach a climb, itâll automatically trigger and show you details of that upcoming climb, such as this:\n\nYouâll see details about the gradient displayed within the color of the chevrons on the map. You can tap through a few different data pages that show details about the climb.\n\nNext, you can execute structured workouts from Wahooâs own app, or TrainingPeaks. At present, TrainerRoad is not yet supported. As part of the migration to the Wahoo App, these connections havenât been completed yet. And others are missing as well. TrainerRoad says thatâs coming soon.\n\nIn any case, you can open up the structured workout on the workouts page to see a list of scheduled workouts. In my case, I manually created one in TrainingPeaks, since my TrainerRoad ones werenât coming through anymore.\n\nAs you execute it, youâll see details about each step automatically, and alerts accordinglyâ¦sometimes. You see, thereâs a ton of bugs here.\n\nâ Skipped showing the progress bar during the warmup\n\nâ Didnât show any interval alerts if I wasnât on the interval page (so if I was on another data page, zero notification of the start of an interval) [Update: It apparently does, except that option is now hidden deep in a menu setting, and set for default off. Why? WHY?!?!]\n\nâ Didnât adhere to TrainingPeaks âpause till lapâ option\n\nâ Didnât show my current power line, as Wahooâs own marketing site says it should\n\nI do like the little pop-over at the bottom, but again, it only shows on the workout page, which kinda defeats the point of a popover.\n\nAnd hereâs Wahooâs page (main Wahoo ACE site), indicating I should be seeing my actual power line shown, but it doesnât work either:\n\nFinally, with everything finished, you can end your ride. Here youâll get a ride summary screen, with information as such:\n\nThat said, one super frustrating piece is that despite having the new activity profiles (e.g., Mountain Bike, Gravel, etcâ¦), none of those carry into Strava. Wahoo isnât setting that attribute like all of their competitors are, and thus, youâll still need to update these in Strava after the fact.\n\nNonetheless, all of your data otherwise does appear correctly there.\n\nThe Bike Bell:\n\nI was going to include the bike bell within the âBasicsâ section above, but I figured Iâd break it out. If for no other reason than to have one section thatâs mostly positive.\n\nSomewhat humorously, Wahoo seemed keen to hide its best feature. All of Wahooâs initial PR efforts almost entirely ignored the bike bell. Thankfully, at the last minute, they changed their mind. The Wahoo digital bike bell allows you to double-tap the screen to instantly hear a very loud and audible bike bell sound. Itâs virtually indistinguishable from the Garmin Edge 1050 bike bell/sound.\n\nItâs hard to visually show you the bike bell, because thereâs no menu item. It just exists audibly, and as noted, you can double-tap anywhere on the screen to make it sound instantly. Well, sorta.\n\nAs long as that screen isnât the map screen. For some odd reason, it doesnât work on the map screen. Or the workout screen. Or the elevation screens. Wahoo said that was because there were concerns about people using touch on that map screen and thus accidentally ding-donging. Except, by default, touch on the map screen is already disabled (it has that little lock icon at right). Thus, no amount of rubby-rubby would have moved the map anyway. Certainly, simply unlocking the screen would have disabled the bike bell? Or, using the accelerometer to detect a double-tap would have been possible, no?\n\nIn any event, that (moderate) annoyance aside, the bike bell is awesome. You can also tap just below the pause button in the center of the screen:\n\nOne other thing to note about the bike bell is that itâs *always* at full volume. Meaning, no matter what settings you configure the rest of your audio alerts for (e.g. a less imposing volume), the bike bell remains the same volume. I actually appreciate this.\n\nHowever, I should also mention that unfortunately there is no method to configure the bike bell from the shifter buttons like on the Garmin Edge 1050 (or Hammerhead Karoo 3), which allows you to configure the extra shifter/bonus buttons to trigger the bike bell, which is super cool. Hopefully Wahoo will add that down the road.\n\nNavigation:\n\nWhen it comes to navigation, the ACE can route much the same as past Wahoo devices, though, there are some differences to be aware of that weâll dive into.\n\nFirst though, is getting routes to your device. For most people, those routes will come from platforms like Strava, Komoot or other 3rd party entities. That said, you can import GPX/FIT/TCX files directly into it, using the Files app on your phone, and opening it with the Wahoo app. Or selecting a previous route from history.\n\nOnce thatâs done, itâll show up on the âRoutesâ listing on your device, such as this:\n\nThat said, at the moment, this Routes listing is a giant shaker bottle of routes, without any ability to order the routes. In my case, I had Strava routes from years ago imported in, which is fine. But whatâs not fine is that I canât sort them in any way. I can only search them by name, which then requires me to remember exactly what I named each route that someone else might have created. Most bike computers, including all of Wahooâs existing ones, have a sorting option at the top (such as by Date, A-Z, Starred, Length, and Proximity â as is the case on the Wahoo ROAM V2).\n\nDespite showing this on Wahooâs marketing site, itâs not there today:\n\nWahoo says this will come at some point, hopefully soon. This is one of a number of examples of things being shown on the box, that are not on the unit in real-life.\n\nIn any case, once youâve managed to find your route and select it, youâll see an elevation profile and overview of the route.\n\nI do appreciate the easy option to âReverseâ the route though, something that despite all logic and years of requests, doesnât exist on a Garmin Edge series device (but does exist on their wearables).\n\nWith the route loaded, weâll head out riding. If we were to look at the map page first, youâll see the route as a series of chevrons on the route line. Moreover, the color of those chevrons indicates the climb gradients as you ride along, which is clever/handy:\n\nI do appreciate the coloring and map styles here. The way Wahoo has selected to colorize the different bits of info on the map screen (such as other streets/landscapes/etcâ¦) makes this screen really easy to understand, and the thick chevrons make it easy to confirm your direction at a glance. That said, when dimmed (as effectively required to get half-decent battery life), itâs much harder to read.\n\nIf you tap the layers icon, you can adjust various map layers, including points of interest, custom waypoints, street names, wind, and Summit Segments. Note that in this context, âWindâ doesnât mean an overlay of the wind direction/forecast, but rather, just wind from the wind sensor.\n\nNote that Wahoo does include street names now on some streets. I havenât quite figured out the exact pattern to which streets it shows them on, and which zoom levels. While some people love street names on maps, I rarely use them either way â likely because Iâm more interested in the actual route line itself, which Wahoo does a good job on. I think theyâve found a good balance between the coloring of the map and the clarity of the chevron line.\n\n(Top: Wahoo ACE, left COROS Dura, right Hammerhead Karoo 3, bottom Garmin Edge 1050, right handlebar â badly in need of new bar tape.)\n\nLikewise, you can tap to enable the cue sheet as well at any time, if youâd prefer to see that:\n\nIn the event youâre on another data page (not the map page), and you have an upcoming turn, itâll show a turn written prompt and give you an audible alert, and even voice directions to turn.\n\nBut again, there are two problems here. First, by default, none of these occur. You need to enable these voice turn alerts in the settings. Why on earth navigation and voice prompts arenât enabled by default is beyond my pay grade.\n\nHowever, that gets to the second issue, the speaker volume. To be very clear: The speaker is loud AF (which is great for certain things). Seriously, itâs bone-jarringly loud. So loud your riding buddies will quickly try and body-check you into the nearest herd of cows they can find.\n\nFear not though, Wahoo has a solution for that, the volume slider. This slider has three levels: Loud AF, blah, and unbearable.\n\nFor navigation voice prompts, Loud AF is OK. Iâd quibble that the voice should be slightly higher pitched, so itâs easier to hear in the wind, but thatâs an easy change they could make. However, once you go down to the middle option, the voice is impossible to hear in the wind. And while the bike bell ignores the volume settings (as it should), there isnât a way to separate voice prompt volume from the rest of the beeps your unit makes.\n\nAgain, their competitors have two sliders for a reason here: Voices are harder to hear in the wind than high-pitched beeps. Anyone whoâs gone on a ride with friends knows this.\n\nIn any case, back to our ride. The next piece is your route profile thatâs showing the elevation profile up ahead, seen at the bottom there. That elevation profile shows the next 2KM of your routeâ¦.and only the next 2KM of your route:\n\nWhile past Wahoo units allowed far greater lengths than that (coughâ¦the entire route), the ACE is limited here to 2KM.\n\nOnce again, the Wahoo box (and everything on the Wahoo site) shows this enumerating the full route as an elevation profile (showing âTotalâ). And again, Iâm not trying to be nit-picky here, but rather illustrating that this unit simply isnât ready. Hard stop.\n\nI know this may come as a surprise to some: But stop shipping products that donât do what it says on the box and your marketing site. Simply delay. The fastest way to get a reviewer angry is to literally not do the thing printed on the front of your box.\n\nNext, when it comes to on-demand routing, you can save locations at any point and navigate back to them, as well as drag to a point on the map (on unit) and route to it. Both of these are under the âroutesâ option, then âRoute Toâ option).\n\nThese worked perfectly fine, and instantly, for me. Except the ability to rename saved waypoints, that doesnât work at all right now. Thus, itâs just named whatever random street name you tapped (not âHomeâ or âWorkâ or âHot Dog Standâ). Wahoo says thatâs on the way too, though that too is listed as being a current feature on their marketing site.\n\nLikewise, the ability to select a point on the map from the Wahoo app doesnât work either anymore (coming soonish). However, you can send a location from Google Maps or Apple Maps to the Wahoo app, and that worked intermittently for me.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that there are existing navigation providers that Wahoo hasnât yet ported to the new Wahoo app yet. Thereâs no timelines on these, other than the second half of next year. But exactly which ones are getting re-added isnât clear.\n\nThe Wind Sensor:\n\nRepeat after me: This is not an aero sensor, this is not an aero sensor, this is not an aero sensor.\n\nIt is however, a wind sensor capable of measuring wind speed coming into it. And while most aero sensors have that same starting point, thatâs about where it ends. In fact, the jump from measuring aerodynamic drag is massive â but not so much hardware, rather, software and user education. Itâs why almost every company that enters the cycling aero sensor landscape has failed. And almost all of those remaining that havenât failed, have invariably pivoted towards coaching services instead. So get aero sensor out of your head, and letâs focus on what it actually is.\n\nInstead, the Wahoo ACE has a wind sensor for measuring the wind speed, then combining it with your known ground speed, and calculating whether youâve got a headwind, tailwind, or some sort of drafting boost. It calls this âWahoo Wind Dynamicsâ, which admittedly makes me giggle a little bit like a 6-year-old boy and think about the âwind dynamicsâ after eating Taco Bell.\n\nWhile riding, Wahoo gives you a single color-coded data field, titled Airspeed, which is shown in either Airspeed MPH or Airspeed KPH, just like the below (lower half is Airspeed, Iâve added ground speed to the upper half):\n\nThe coloring is basically the following groupings:\n\nThe idea being that you can quantify how much youâre saving when you tuck in behind someone to draft, because youâll see those two numbers differ. If the AirSpeed is higher than the ground speed, youâve got a headwind. If itâs lower, youâve either got a tailwind or are drafting.\n\nI could then take the ground speed number, compare it to the airspeed number, do some mental math, and figure out exactly what the wind speed is (tailwind or headwind). Whichâ¦is yes, as silly as it sounds. To me, I shouldnât have to be doing mental math on a ride constantly. It should simply do this automatically, and instead show me the final number â as either a headwind or tailwind/draft.\n\nAt the end of the ride, youâll see the numbers shown on the unit with percentages of time spent in the different color-coded zones (labeled as either AirBoost or AirDrag):\n\nMy complaint here isnât adding a wind sensor to the Wahoo bike computer. Instead, itâs that itâs just not providing any value beyond what I already know. And the singular area it could have provided value (showing impacts of drafting), is far too cumbersome of a number to be constantly doing mental math on. Just give me a number that weâre all calculating in our heads anyway.\n\nLong term, it remains to be seen how Wahoo can leverage this differently. I donât see any viable path for Wahoo to use this for CdA calculations. Plenty of companies have tried, and given up there. Not because the tech wasnât ready, but because 98% of riders donât understand the *VAST* amounts of knowledge required to get proper aero testing done. Silly things like knowing the difference between your shoulders being firm or relaxed will hugely impact testing. Or that moving your fingers 1cm will impact testing. Or doing multiple test runs, etcâ¦\n\nItâs why virtually every aero sensor company on the market today that started life as a consumer aero sensor company/device, has shifted to being a coaching device, whereby the coach goes and does a seminar first to learn how to use the aero sensor, and then spends an absurd amount of time with athletes ensuring they execute tests correctly.\n\nPoint is, I feel like that weight could have been much better spent on an LED light (even as an emergency light because youâre running behind, or a built-in safety camera (akin to Cycliq Fly12), orâ¦anything else.\n\nNow, all that said, for those geeks in the crowd, I will give Wahoo credit for properly populating the .FIT File with this data. In fact, they populate it with much more data than they show you on the screen. This includes the raw wind speed values, the categorization value (which of those color coded categories above), as well as a power to grade ratio value that theyâve been playing with in Alpha testing (you just donât see the data field on our units, as thatâs not available yet).\n\nIf you load any ACE file into the DCR Analyzer, you can see all this data using the âDeveloper Fieldâ toggle (which simply shows .FIT file data fields). Hereâs the windy ride I did in the Netherlands with the 50KPH winds that day:\n\nNow, thereâs a lot to look at. Iâve set my dot/curser at the highest wind point, where you can see the wind categorization is higher. The wind speed is shown in 1000 x m/s (meters/second), otherwise known as millimeters/second. The cool part is the data is there for people to use.\n\nAnd most critically, they do separate out the wind speed component here. Thus, Iâd love for them to allow/show me a data field with just the wind speed component too. Note, that if you want to play with that original .FIT file, itâs located under the download link on the DCR Analyzer set page.\n\nBattery Burn:\n\nLook, itâs not good. Thereâs no two ways to say it. It falls *FAR* short of their claims of 30 hours of battery life, and is roughly in line with the Hammerhead Karoo 3âs battery life when the Karoo 3 is at 50% brightness (which is far brighter than the ACE screen can go). It falls behind the Garmin Edge 1050âs battery burn, and is leagues behind the Edge 1040 or Edge 1040 Solar battery. Again, in real-life numbers.\n\nSo, letâs look at the official claim and then a crap-ton of testing Iâve done. Officially, the claim is simply âup to 30+ hoursâ, depending on which part of the site you look at. Hereâs the quote from their press release:\n\nBut in subsequent conversations, Wahoo clarified the actual claim is â30 hours of GPS battery life with the backlight in 5-second off settingâ. This means that after 5 seconds of touching the unit, the backlight turns off, and is unreadable depending on your lighting conditions. When in direct sunlight â no problems. But in the winter shade? Problems, especially on screens with smaller fonts (more data fields), or zoomed out maps.\n\nEven worse, the default configuration setting for the Wahoo ACE is the so-called âAutoâ mode, which basically changes the backlight constantly, though short of summer sun on the beach, it seems to keep it at 100%. In that mode, I was burning roughly 8-12%/hour (across numerous 3-4 hour rides), depending on exactly which screen I was on. Yes, that puts it on target for 10-15 hours of battery life.\n\nThe âbestâ battery scenario I could muster was 5.71%/hour (thus 17-hours) when I set it for 5-second off, on a mountain bike ride two days ago. Though, one couldnât see the screen half the time, and given I was mountain biking, it wasnât like I could just touch the screen easily to see it again.\n\nInterestingly, after a bunch of rides and different configurations, I noticed:\n\nâ Plain data field pages obviously burned the least battery, though, if they had any color blocks in them (e.g. zone changing color blacks), they *destroyed* battery life, even more than the map page. This was true even with just two data fields, if one was color (e.g. the wind page),\n\nâ There was no meaningful difference in the number of sensors paired impacting battery life.\n\nâ There was no obvious difference between having navigation enabled or not, battery life seemed to burn equally.\n\nâ None of these figures include LiveTracking or Strava Live Segments, as both are unavailable at this time. Further, none of these figures included screen recording enabled.\n\nâ As noted, by far, the biggest impact was which backlight time setting was enabled.\n\nNow, Wahoo says a secondary low-power saving backlight mode is coming in the first half of 2025. This mode will find a better balance between the backlight setting and battery burn. Though honestly, Iâm not convinced thatâs the issue. I think Wahoo needs to look more carefully at the rest of the code running and optimize there instead.\n\nThe reason I say that, is if we look at the Hammerhead Karoo 3 and Edge 1050, both of which have *FAR* more demanding screens (in terms of battery burn), both can outperform it, even in far brighter settings with far smaller batteries. And then if we look at similar screen technology types, like the Edge 1040, that too easily outperforms it on any setting you want.\n\nPoint is, I donât really understand why the battery burn is as bad as it is, for as big a battery as Wahoo has. And while I say the term âbadâ here despite the Hammerhead Karoo 3 being similar, keep in mind the Karoo is basically half the size, and far brighter.\n\nGPS & Elevation Accuracy:\n\nWhile this review hasnât been packed with good news, fear not, this section delivers in that realm. The quick version is the GPS accuracy via the dual-frequency GPS chipset, as well as the elevation accuracy, is spot on.\n\nOf course, letâs get into the data. In this case, most of my data sets have at least three other devices running, thus making the full set:\n\nWahoo ELEMNT ACE\n\nGarmin Edge 1050\n\nHammerhead Karoo 3\n\nCOROS DURA\n\nI also had an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and an AmazFit T-Rex 3 on most rides to cross-validate if I needed, but didnât bother pulling them into these data sets, simply to keep things a little less jumbled.\n\nFirst up, letâs look at a four-hour road ride into the mountains. Hereâs the high-level overview, where things obviously look identical:\n\nAfter zooming in on the entire track, itâs basically perfect. Nonetheless, letâs look at some of the mountain switchback sections, just to demonstrate it.\n\nAbove, you can see a descent. The way you can tell is how âtightâ the tracks are (or, by knowing my direction of travelâ¦). In this case, the tracks are slightly looser (above), then below, which is a descent. Still, in both cases, the tracks are all within the roadway of the map, and nobody is doing anything funky.\n\nHereâs another very tight switchback section, with complete 180* turns:\n\nOf course, GPS accuracy is only one part of the picture. This route had plenty of climbing on it, and all four units were quite close. Iâd quibble that the COROS DURAâs altimeter seems the least accurate of the four in my testing, sometimes being a bit offset, but hardly by much.\n\nWhen it comes to sensor data, I had both a power meter and heart rate sensor connected to all computers, all to the same sensor. Thus, youâd want to see identical data across them. And sure enough, thatâs the case. Below is the heart rate graph, merely because itâs a bit âprettierâ (easier) data set to look at since heart rate is far more stable than power. Point is, Iâm not seeing any data connectivity or capture issues.\n\nFinally, I rarely include âtotalsâ stats in my accuracy sections, because they can be easily misleading. A device can undershoot and overshoot corners and still end up with the same distance as an accurate device. Nonetheless, for fun, hereâs the total distance and ascent highlighted here. The COROS Dura is slightly further out on distance than the others, but is in the mix for ascent.\n\nOk, letâs quickly look at another data set, this one a three-hour ride, partially near the sea (some interesting tidbits there on elevation in a second), and partially up into the mountains.\n\nHere on one of the tight switchback sections (ascending), you notice a little bit of variance from the Edge 1050. That makes sense, as I was trying to get some pretty shots of the ACE solo on the handlebars, so the Karoo 3 and Edge 1050 were on my top-tube, and the Edge 1050 was closest to my crotch (with my body blocking it). In case youâre curious, that very photo is the last photo in this review (for the summary section). In any case, despite that, all three were very close:\n\nAnd even in the straightaways, all were fine too (youâd be surprised how often GPS units screw-up straightaways).\n\nThat said, the elevation is actually super interesting. To begin, itâs perfectly fine by most definitions. That said, we notice a few things. The first arrow is alongside the sea/water on the dock. Thus the Edge 1050 is clearly the most correct at 2.4 meters. Whereas the Karoo and Wahoo are a bit high there. However, as I ascend all the units seem to consolidate. The second arrow is where we stopped at a grocery store for about 20 minutes. Notice the very slight altimeter drift there on the ACE. Only about 1-2 meters, but I thought it was geeky interesting.\n\nIn any event, nobody likely cares about 1-2 meters of elevation drift (and frankly, neither do I).\n\nSo instead, letâs look at one more data set, a mountain bike set. This is a blend of trees, some riding near cliffs, and some open terrain. Hereâs the overall view:\n\nI wouldnât say this is crazy challenging GPS terrain (my road rides were actually tougher), but nonetheless, MTB it is (though I have gravel biked this route, but itâs spicy rough).\n\nIn any case, letâs start off with this tree section at a high view. Things look good, right?\n\nBut hereâs the kicker when you zoom in: This is actually a loop, with repeated passes (from different directions). Very solid.\n\nHereâs some higher-speed descent stuff (doubled back up too), without any issues:\n\nThe elevation is again fodder for geeks. Those three arrows? Itâs when I went down to the beach. I didnât wheel dip, but was up on the shore at about 2m in altitude. You can see the ACE presents it as much higher at 5m in altitude. Not a huge deal there, though, the 15m offset on one of the climbs is surprising. Albeit, by the second climb, it is perfectly aligned.\n\nIn this case, my geekery aside, overall GPS and elevation on much longer/bigger/complex routes looks very solid. Zero issues there, and the same goes for data sensor connectivity, where I havenât had any drops or connection issues once paired with sensors.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nCyclists kept asking Wahoo to make a bike computer with a better and bigger display, and on that specific point, they checked the box. In fact, Iâll even agree that their new home screen/dashboard is better than before. And that their map styling pages are very solid. And yes, the bike bell is awesome. Seriously, thatâs (by far) the best feature on this unit.\n\nBut in almost every other category, Wahoo simply launched this device too early, and at too high of a price relative to their competitors or the capabilities the ACE has today. It lacks significant features and integrations seen on the Wahoo ROAM V2 or BOLT V2 (their current bike computers), and falls far short of the claimed 30 hours of battery life in my testing. And thatâs before we talk about the screen visibility, or the value of the aero sensor. I just donât understand why Wahoo keeps launching bike computers too early each time, while they stick the landing perfectly on trainer launches most times. There was zero reason to launch this in early December, versus waiting till next March.\n\nIn fact, it seems to be an industry trend this year. We saw the COROS Dura launch far too early, so much so the company then had to repeatedly delay shipping for both hardware and software reasons. Weâve seen startups JESPR and Absolute One also launch at both crazy-high prices and with the feature sets of a 2012 bike computer. Still, Hammerhead did launch their Karoo 3 this past spring to appropriate pricing, finished features with most of the polish required, and solid accuracy. And Garmin also launched their Edge 1050 this past summer at the same price as their previous top-end device, with virtually no complaints from reviewers or consumers alike.\n\nThe problem is, launching unbaked early gets you reviews like this. Reviews that live for *years* on the internet. Sure, perhaps Iâll update it as Wahoo improves in future firmware, but that wonât change the YouTube video, which canât be updated. And sure, I could publish another YouTube video down the road each month they restore new features, but reviews months later rarely top the charts in consumer searches.\n\nI want companies like Wahoo or COROS to challenge the growing bike computer monopoly. I think both have significant unique things to offer there. In the case of COROS, itâs crazy battery life and extremely good pricing. In the case of Wahoo it tends to be simplicity and ease of use. But launching half-baked products like this only damages their reputation, furthering their competitorsâ position.\n\nSigh.\n\nWith that, thanks for reading (or supporting independent reviews like this)!",

Others talk about having some kind of \"loading\" for transitioning between maps, which would be equivalent to a different raid in each one. Finally, some speak of a truly open world like DayZ.\n\nAnd thinking about it, the Streets map alone is very heavy. I wonder how having all the maps in an open world would be; it seems quite unthinkable, doesn't it?\n\nSo, what do we officially know today about Tarkov's open world?\n\n2 hours ago, brunnodrk said:\n\nWhen I bought the EFT beta in 2017, I used to hear a lot of people talking about EFT in an open world, but today hardly anyone says anything besides speculations.\n\nOk first to clarify those a bit.\n\nFirst it was suppose to be \"FREE ROAM\" MODE, so it was never intended to replace raid systems.\n\nAccording to some informations from interviews, it was suppose to act as \"1 big raid, without PMC respawns\" At least thats how i understand \"1 big map with 64 players\" but i may be wrong, it was never discussed exactly how it suppose to work.\n\nThen they said that this MODE will be unlocked once we escape from tarkov (finish story)\n\nAnd then, one of last informations was \"Propably instead 1 big map, there are gonna be 2, Streets and all other maps combined, reason is that Streets suppose to be \"as big as all other maps combined\".\n\nHere is post from 2019 where TheWay said it was still in plan\n\n(TheWay was like Main Emissary guy for Europe if i am correct)\n\nAnd i belive that in 2021 @ShiroTenshi did the same. I can't find it, but recently i had a talk with someone and i think i seen such post/comment.\n\nI think it's one of last informations about Free Roam Mode tho or like \"confirmations\" of any kind.\n\n2 hours ago, brunnodrk said:\n\nOthers talk about having some kind of \"loading\" for transitioning between maps, which would be equivalent to a different raid in each one.\n\nYes, at some point Nikita mentioned \"map to map travel\" as idea or place holder (or thats how most of ppl understood him).\n\nSo instead going straight to Labs, you would have to go Hideout -> Streets -> Labs -> Streets -> Hideout\n\nCause you know, not all maps are connected with Hideout and maps overall are connected with other maps.\n\n(fan made, not offical map, just how it \"could\" look like more or less)\n\n2 hours ago, brunnodrk said:\n\nSo, what do we officially know today about Tarkov's open world?\n\nWell, thing is that in 2016-2018 we did belive in such promises, but then with each other map, we (players) seen that such vision is most likely out of reach.\n\nI belive it still MIGHT be plan/idea for Tarkov, but it's not possible to do.\n\nWhy i think so?\n\nWell, imagine having all map combines (beside Streets), having 64 players and like 200 scavs + loot, it would be really bad for your FPS.\n\nOr there is better visualisation. STreets suppose to be \"as big as all other map combined\" so far it's not even near and we achive like 60-90 fps (On good PC) with only 18 players? And like 30 scavs?\n\nWhat i would really love to see, it's HONEST podcasts with Nikita, not those BS which we were getting, where Nikita does not answer 90% of \"good\" questions, just answer to some with \"It's planned\" \"we wanna do this\".\n\nI would love to see WHATS actually planned, a whole list and whats scraped.\n\nCause looking at Old Gameplays/trailers/interviews we have poo ton of content which was shown but it's cut.\n\nexample:\n\n- Customs dorms - Had a light switch (Gameplay trailer from 2016?)\n\n- Streets Primorsky - Had a light switch (One of first Streets Trailer)\n\n- Streets Concordia - Breakable wall (Battle of concorcia trailer?)\n\n- Melle knife kills animation - One of first EFT gameplay trailer\n\n- Grenade explosion effect (Flying debree, doors being opened by explosion) - One of first gameplay trailers\n\n- Lightkeeper announcments - \"FIrst in game TRADER\" meanwhile it's x wipe with him and he still does not sell anything\n\n- BTR on Streets - Having a group of AI riding on it - Streets Expansion trailer\n\n- \"Kolontay guard will have Ballistic shield, most likely either not lootable or that PMC will not be able to leave map with it and they will be in police station\" - Podcast/interview - Not existing in game\n\n- \"Clans will appear with EFT Arena\" - First informations about Arena in 2021 or 2022.\n\nANd way way way way way way more\n\nI just would love to know whats planned for sure and whats removed completly",

I hope you all had great holiday vacation. After being hospitalized for the whole month of December I'm happy to announce I am finally back home And catching up with everything related to TSW. I have been playing around with free roam as I really didn't get a chance to check it out or even go into full depth of what you can and cannot do in this new feature. to make a long story short I have spawned in Midland mainline and basically try to couple as many American trains with the same couplers together. I have literally spent days putting together many different combinations At my favorite point/station in Midland Mainline alongside what I thought to be nuclear reactors Or from what I was told to be a gas plant.\n\nthis was very tedious and found myself yard shunting for literally three days straight before burning myself all of the different Consists lol. I had so much fun messing around with this new feature that I had to make a video showing off my Frankenstein consist is what I'm going to call it and also would like to know if anyone else has tried this with UK or German locomotives. Keep in mind most trains as long as they have the same coupler can pair together but in some cases cannot couple or even move once coupled together due to incompatibility. I do not own all of UK's content and the same could be said for some German routes I still need to get Which is why I mainly focused on what I owned most of.\n\nI do want to add that you can couple the class 66 and the class 43 with American consist Due to the fact they share the same knuckle coupler.\n\nhope you guys enjoy the video and if has a UK version or a German version please share video and pictures down below I would like to see as I think it's really cool\n\nback in the day it was coal fired think in more recent they may have switched to gas bio fuels or may still burn some coal ..with all the clean green energy pushed nowadays lot s of coal fired power stations being closed demolished or converted to natural gas bio fuels etc ..in the game when i went back into unloading loop there a big pile of coal ..i wish they would do a cargo pack for services to power station but free roam will let you do that",

      "# [Gran Turismo 8 - if you had the power to completely design the experienceâ¦ by NC mrbabyboyd, Famine GTP Editor, OR Jump_Ace JUMPxACE on 2024-05-06](https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/gran-turismo-8-if-you-had-the-power-to-completely-design-the-experience%E2%80%A6.426731/)\nHi all,\n\nGiven the current state of Gran Turismo 7 (and it will continue to expand), Iâve always wondered how people (the GTPlanet community) would design the play experience of Gran Turismo 8.\n\nIâd love to hear (and even see) how you would layout the career mode, for example:\n\nWould it be similar to previous games in terms of the layout e.g. Beginner, Professional events etc?\n\nWhat features would you implement and how would you design them e.g. Driving Missions and how youâd have them, or drag racing mode for example?\n\nHow the cars would be displayed in dealerships and how you want them to appear and how the pricing works for them?\n\nHow would you design, change (or remove entirely) the license tests?\n\nHow would you design an arcade mode - all cars and tracks available instantly, or have it like Gran Turismo 4, or even Gran Turismo 3 for example?\n\nThe online experience and how daily races, time trials work and perhaps other things you come up with?\n\nOther things to make the career mode in your eyes âbetterâ?\n\nDISCLAIMER: I fully appreciate that Gran Turismo 7 has plenty of longevity left and there are still key improvements we want for Gran Turismo 7 before we even think about Gran Turismo 8. Therefore treat this as a bit of fun - treat it as Polyphony Digital is giving YOU the power to decide how a Gran Turismo 8 experience would/should be. I would like Gran Turismo 7 to be the best it can be before a Gran Turismo 8 would appear.\n\nPenultimately, I also appreciate if this is technically not in the right forum place but I canât really see where else.\n\nFinally, Iâll at some point apply my input - otherwise if you have ideas, designs/spreadsheets etc, then Iâd love to hear and see them.\n\n(If something like this exists already, then this sub-forum topic can be removed).\n\nHere's the idea I've always in my head, which I don't remotely have the artistic talent to mock up unfortunately.\n\nGT is better when it focuses on the cars rather than being about the driver IMO - that's far better done by sims that focus on racing cars. So I've tried to fit the career to the car roster, rather than trying to force a racing sim career onto a car roster that isn't built for it.\n\nThe main career screen would be a timeline, with rows for each decade between the 1950s to 2020s (with maybe a nebulous \"future\" one after that for VGT stuff). Then, you'd have cups, based on various road car themes, that go across the timeline like so:\n\nAn 86 vs BRZ Cup cup that would have a 1980s round for the Levin/Trueno, a 2010s round for the gen 1 86/BRZ, and a 2020s round for the gen 2 GR86/BRZ.\n\nA Corvette Festival cup that would have a 50s round for the C1, a 60s round for the C2/C3, an 80s round for the C4, an 00s round for the C6, a 10s round for the C7 and a 20s round for the C8. A 90s round could be added if a C5 was DLC.\n\nA SEMA cup that would currently just have a 10s round, but could add a 00s round if previous winners were added.\n\nFerrari Challenge, which would have rounds in every decade (except the 20s currently)\n\nYou could also do entry level stuff like Sunday Cup, which would combine the current Sunday Cup and Sunday Cup Classic (and actually have a power limit this time), so you'd have an entry level event to enter your Mazda3 in.\n\nWinning all events in a cup would provide a car that would help for a related cup, for example the 86/BRZ cup might reward you with an Impreza or a Supra for Stars of Pleiades or a Supra cup.\n\nBut the real goal you would be working towards while completing cups is to fully complete a decade. When you complete all events in a decade, you would unlock a race championship or championships for that decade:\n\nCompleting all the 50s events would unlock a championship for cars like the W194 or the old Maserati\n\nCompleting all the 60s events would unlock a championship balanced for the three legendary cars (though you could still enter stuff like the 250 GT)\n\nThe 70s is kinda hard, only the 917K and 2J are there at the minute. This would need more cars added.\n\nCompleting the 80s would unlock a Group C Championship (you can use the early 90s cars) and a Group B rally championship\n\nCompleting the 90s would unlock a GT1 championship and a classic GT500 championship and a Group A rally championship\n\nCompleting the 00s would unlock an early LMP championship that would again need cars like the R8 and Speed 8 to be added\n\nCompleting the 10s would unlock a GT3 championship and an LMP1 championship\n\nCompleting the 20s would unlock a hypercar championship and a modern GT500 championship\n\nThen beating all the decade race championships would unlock the \"final boss\" race championships like the X2019 or the formula cars, maybe the endurances too.\n\nI like the idea because it puts the \"learning about car history\" idea (that's kind of the core ideal of the franchise at this point) into the actual races instead of being relegated to text everybody skips. But it also gives players freedom to do different stuff in different orders, while still retaining progression and having a goal people are aiming for.\n\nRacing:\n\nCompletely remove the Cafe as the gameplay progression mechanic. It feels arbitrarily small and limiting. I don't mind the concept of the Cafe as an element of the game, but it shouldn't be the thing the whole game revolves around. For the racing calendar, replace it with some kind of race hub that allows you to join teams to compete at different levels of motorsport - and with that, most races should be at least 10 laps, and most of them should be part of championships. The 3 lap chase the rabbit battles in GT7 are so bad...\n\nA proper endurance racing series with at least 10 races per car classification. (These could totally be multi-class events that you need to win in each class).\n\nOther:\n\nAside from the very basic changes above that I think are needed to make GT a proper racing game, I'd like to see PD try some new things, and try a little harder on some other things:\n\nWhy not some kind of open road area? The scapes movies are such a tease - I'd love to escape the race track in a GT title. This may be a game unto itself depending on the scope of implementation but I would honestly be happy with just some great point to point locations such as:\n\nCalifornia Coast\n\nGerman Autobahn\n\nTokyo Highway (free roam)\n\nRoute Napolean\n\nMt. Haruna\n\nLake Como Loop\n\nFor a series with so much chill between gameplay, there is a frustrating lack of chill (including down to the music selections) available during actual driving - particularly in the ridiculously short chase the rabbit events. Even the baffling music missions, seemingly a great opportunity to chill, are frantic as hell. There is no relaxing driving in this game, and that's kind of a missed opportunity, IMO. What if you could, while in VR, sit in the back of a Toyota Alphard listening to music while another player is driving around a Tokyo freeway at night? I'd be into it.\n\nThe other thing tragically lacking, despite it's continued inclusion, is off road driving. I don't know if Kaz thinks PD's implementation of \"rally\" driving is fun or what, but it seriously needs a rethink. I remember being super stoked at the idea of rally racing being part of GT2 prior to that game's release, and then being disappointed in it's implementation back then....when I was like 10. It hasn't improved in the quarter century since then, sadly. While I get that stage races might not be the gameplay PD wants to spend time developing, there has GOT to be a better way to do dirt than the absolutely terrible and geographically suspect (THIS is the approximate IRL location of the Colorado springs circuit, per the weather radar - which really makes you wonder what they were thinking every step of the way...) implementation they settled on. Honestly, GT2-4 had way, way better dirt circuits than GT5-GT7, which isn't saying much.\n\nIf all else fails, look back to GT4.\n\nCool thread idea!\n\n1) Make what I call a 'Money Race'. Where it's a single race, medium length (like 5-10laps), medium difficulty race where you win a significant car for a more difficult series later on. And said car just happens to be worth a ton of money (1-3mil?). Did I mention you could do this race over and over to win the prize car again and again?\n\n2) Bring back every original track in their former GT6 glory in hi-res, along with the new ones (because why not?).\n\n3) Bring back every actual race track in former GT titles.\n\n4) Bring back all the missing cars from GT3 & GT4, in their current gen, hi-res, ray tracing form.\n\n5) Bring Sophy to its full potential, dump the old AI completely. Along with scalable difficulty for each race.\n\n6) Improve BOP\n\n7) Improve Penalty System\n\n8) Add a little bit of storyline to the offline career mode with two calendars; kart to professional racing calendar and a fun/off season, or maybe invitational only calendar. Perhaps the protagonist's father was a pro driver but only made it to GT4 and tragically died in a race (your uncle raised you and brought you up in racing); one you eventually do yourself. I'm thinking the professional race calendar would be races in which car specs are locked down or use BOP and you earn top prize money. The invitational calendar would host more open, 'suggested' BHP races, smaller payouts but with those valuable prize cars.\n\n9) The only restriction to buying a car is money; no more invitations\n\n10) Add caster and tire pressure adjustments\n\n11) Add a proper clutch option, that does not instantly make you faster when using it\n\n12) Update physics engine and tire model (ACC physics anyone?)\n\n13) Bring back slow motion replays along with control inputs for them. Or better yet, integrate with Motec.\n\n14) Make the drift events completely optional (rewardless). Even expand upon what was in GT7, but don't force me to do them, also\n\n15) Bring back side events like the One Lap Magic and Driving Missions from GT4 (but leave out Mission 34, or if you bring it back, don't make us wait 90 seconds, c'mon now)\n\n16) Increase the license test difficulty.\n\nI think the visuals are on point and polished, I love the PSVR2 and motion option and I think the sound is 'fine'. If PD outsourced some of this work, it may be possible to get it all done. If this was all promised, I'd be fine waiting another 4-5 years before GT8 launched.\n\nJerome\n\nThis:\n\nYep, pretty much this. GT5 is of course where it all went wrong\n\nIt's difficult to resolved the two things GT wants now - progressively unlocking circuits (GTS/GT7) and teaching players about cars (GT7) - with a web-like career, but it's certainly doable.\n\nHere's my quick'n'dirty overview:\n\nBy way of explanation here:\n\nWithout any progress at all:\n\nThere's five basic Menu Books that introduce you to various things core to the game\n\n~20 races at three-to-six beginner circuits (one/two in each region) covering Sunday Cup and Sunday Cup Classic-type races or track days; low powered cars sub-400PP. These are not linked to the career at all.\n\nYou must complete your B Licence and Book 5 to advance to...\n\nPathway Choice 1 which:\n\nGives you the option of choosing your preferred route: GT, Sports Car, Prototype, Open-Wheel (and whatever else)\n\nEach path has a handful of relevant Menu Books (let's say... three), each unlocking a race series at that level\n\nAt this stage they are national level races (not necessarily requiring just one country's tracks...) at an amateur grade, up to 500PP or so.\n\nComplete a minimum number (say... three again, accounting for updates) the Menu Books to advance to Licence A which unlocks...\n\nPathway Choice 2 which:\n\nAllows you to switch paths or remain on the same one.\n\nSame format again, unlocking more series, but at a higher level - more races across more tracks within the region.\n\nCompleting any one path grants a Bronze Trophy, unlocks Licence IA, and advances you to...\n\nPathway Choice 3 which:\n\nAgain allows you to switch or not.\n\nMuch higher level races again, unlocking more series, taking place at tracks across the globe\n\nCompleting any one path grants a Silver Trophy, unlocks Licence S, and advances you to...\n\nPathway Choice 4, the final choice, which:\n\nGives you one last chance to switch if you wish\n\nLongest and hardest races, endurance level (optional to shorten the race time with higher rates of wear/weather, no less than 30 min)\n\nAwards one Gold Trophy no matter which path and ending movie for completion\n\nAll tracks unlocked at this point\n\nPlayers may then (and let's say at any point too) go back and attempt other pathways, with the relevant menu books, to mop up the trophies (licences no longer required)\n\nUpdates can add more races/series and Menu Books into each section (as only [x] are required to advance this adds options rather than more requirements), as well as optional Menu Books beyond the time line if necessary.\n\nThat's just my \"top of the head\" design anyway.\n\nWhat could Rockstar Games of today teach Polyphony about designing a compelling game?\n\nRIght, there is somewhat of a story going on in the F1 franchise...and agree it's pretty bad, but is GT7's Cafe any better? I think there could be more of a story, or more of a journey through an informative and challenging progression system, or something completely different that enhances the...\n\nAlso, as that's just the career, with every car/track unlocked for Arcade Mode, Livery Editor, and Photomode from the start.\n\nI guess I'm the only one who doesn't like \"everything unlocked\". I've said it elsewhere, but I loved the memories of going to a friend's house to play Gran Turismo 2, and being impressed by all the cars in his garage that I'd never seen before. We'd exchange the secret info of which cars could be found where, it was a lot of fun and made for a unique experience.\n\nSpeaking of Gran Turismo 2 and secrets, its somewhat convoluted dealer layout was great for hiding things, and made the game feel even bigger than it already was. It might sound silly, but having to manually click on individual cars instead of scrolling through that horizontal list made it feel like you were really exploring and discovering things. It's probably not as impressive to seasoned car guys, but for a kid who was only just learning, it was always exciting to poke around the corners of the dealership and be presented with some cool or weird car you didn't know existed.\n\nThe other thing I liked about Gran Turismo 2's dealerships was the \"Special\" category. It felt more organized to me when the racing and concept cars were kept separate from the normal production vehicles. So yeah, my ideal Gran Turismo would have GT2-style car shopping.\n\nI also prefer the open-ended early game of the first five games, where there were many cheap cars to choose from, and you could stick with your starter car and gradually tune it up for awhile. Nothing was more disheartening than starting up Gran Turismo 6 and being forced to buy that Honda Fit. Then GT7 came along with only three choices, then hurriedly ushered you along to a different car after the three intro races. I'm really not a fan of GT7's collection focus that pushes you to constantly change vehicles instead of having fun with your own choices.\n\nBasically, I want:\n\n1. Secrets\n\n2. Cheap cars and things to do with them\n\n3. Seattle Circuit\n\nI'd re-do the audio design and make it much more immersive similar to Project Gotham and Forza Motorsport 4 where the cars have individual intake, engine and exhaust sounds recorded in stereo to match the in-game camera angle so when you turn the camera to the front of the car for example you hear the intake and the exhaust from the rear; as for me personally this makes the experience much more immersive, both the latest Forza and GT7 suffer from Mono exterior audio where Stereo will make the experience much better. I'd also make the high performance and race cars much more brash sounding as they sound overly clean at the moment.\n\nI'll always welcome better sound, but GTS and GT7 made such incredible leaps over their predecessors that its no longer something that breaks the game for me. Every car sounds at least pretty good and in the very least accurate.\n\nI really liked the manufacturer cups in previous games. Here's an idea - get rid of the invitation system as it stands and replace it with one based on brand affinity. Say you really like using Mercedes / AMG cars. How about after 1000 miles of driving Mercedes in races, Mercedes sends you an invitation to not only BUY something special (Lets say a 2000 CLK DTM) but also to compete in a special event, say drive the CLK DTM in a 2000s DTM race series. To add another layer of depth, lets say you win that series - in the CLK. Maybe the prize for that is being rewarded with the ultra rare CLK DTM road car.\n\nNow lets pretend you did that same series but with the Alfa Romeo 155 DTM (purchased from an invitation in a similar way) perhaps you could unlock an Alfa Romeo SZ or some similar - there would be a reason to go back and do the same races over again.\n\nI think the different strands, almost like quests in RPGs, could add a ton of depth to a GT title, and I think it would feel special to unlock these cars that require a few steps to get to.\n\nHere's what I would focus on:\n\n1) Mimic the GT4 career mode as much as possible. Why was GT4 so great?\n\n* The obvious career progression from a Toyota Yaris to a Toyota LMP. Beginner to Expert league. You feel that adrenaline and excitement when you enter the GT World Championship for the first time.\n\nGT7 still has some of this, but the complaints about the cafe menu linearity are valid. I think the cafe menus are fine, the mistake is that they form the backbone of the career mode. Maybe your classic \"GT League\" progression is the main game mode and the cafe menus are side quests. The bonus here is the cafe menus become more fun when they're less structured and not THE primary game mode. Let's say you have a cafe menu to collect Nissan Silvias, so you must watch the UCD for them or maybe you win one from another event. Wouldn't that be more fun than doing 3 races, winning the 3 Silvias you need, and moving on? Again, the game progression wouldn't be locked to the UCD - just the \"side quests.\"\n\n* A decent mix of championships and standalone \"spot races.\" Both have a place in the game, but it's fun counting points until the last race of the season.\n\n* The prize cars from each event. It was fun doing a championship and wondering \"what car will I win at the end of this?\" And it made the grind easier. We don't need to give out a $500k rally car (that can be obtained infinite times) on an A license race...but we can also do better than GT7.\n\nMaybe give out car roulette tickets as event prizes, and you can win those tickets over and over? A 3* car ticket gives you a Toyota 86 or similar, a 4* gives you a BMW M4, a 5* gives you a Gr.3/Gr.4/supercar, and a 6* gives you a high end race car or hyper car? Each ticket can have a low probability of a jackpot prize that increases as you progress through the game.\n\nThis would add motivation to re-doing old races without wrecking the economy.\n\n* There was a \"home race\" for almost every car in the game. WTC 800 is not \"home\" for the Chaparral 2J. WTC 700 is not \"home\" for the Ford GT40 or Ferrari P4. What race does my Porsche 917K fit into? The Neo-Classic race is awesome on paper but is a functionally jumbled mess of Gr.1/Gr.2/Gr.3/Gr.4 cars. Where can I race my Renault R4 or Citroen DS besides the 5,000 cr Sunday Cup?\n\n* Building from above, the depth/specificity of events was so much greater. You had all the fun one-make events that felt like side quests. You had the Polyphony Cup for purely stock cars. You had events for muscle cars, European hot hatchbacks, supercars, Boxers, Naturally aspirated cars, etc. GT7 still has some of that, but too many events are merged into the Sunday/Clubman/Classic/WTC categories.\n\n2) Add practice/qualifying in some fashion. While we're at it, bring back the \"Entry List\" from GT1 so we know how fast Gallo's Alfa Giulia GTAm is.\n\n3) Either implement standing starts (F1 style) or rolling double file starts (ACC/GT3 style). Either would be a giant improvement from the idiotic 40-second rolling start gaps.\n\n4) Focus on either Sophy or \"chili pepper\" AI for all races, with customizable difficulty that increases payouts. I believe every race in the game - GT Cup Gr.3, Lago Maggiore Human Comedy, etc. - should be winnable by any player while simultaneously rewarding the truly skilled.\n\nGoing back to GT4 - the \"A-Spec\" points, although abusable and sometimes inaccurate, provided a benchmark. If you're a newer driver, you knew to tune your car to a 10 A-Spec point race. If you're average, maybe your target is 100. The aliens will aim for 200 and above. Again, it was never a perfect stat, but it was substantially better than entering a race blindly and either destroying the competition or frustratingly getting left in the dust. This could be addressed with more specific difficulty settings.\n\n5) Better overall AI might address this, but randomize the AI so you aren't always chasing F. Portilla's Viper in every event.\n\nMost aspects is better than it has ever been in gt7 campared to past titles.\n\nThats why i mentioned the career mode and progression not part of the given improvments.\n\nYou have not even made your own suggestions for the ideal gt.\n\nI'd disagree with that sentiment to a large degree. But since you asked, I think my opinions from the linked thread apply to what an \"ideal GT\" can be. TLDR: Any new additions to GT8 will be undermined by flaws that PD seemingly can't/won't fix.\n\nWe talk about car/track additions ad nauseum, lets fix some longstanding issues.\n\nAlso, I took the time to respond to some of your suggestions.\n\nHow would you design, change (or remove entirely) the license tests?\n\nThey're perfect as is IMO, they serve their intended purpose well.\n\nHow would you design an arcade mode - all cars and tracks available instantly, or have it like Gran Turismo 4, or even Gran Turismo 3 for example?\n\nArcade mode would be the current iteration of the game in terms of physics. All cars/tracks can be available as you stated. But my big change is in the next bullet point.\n\nGT8 should have a sim mode that isn't catered/centered around the controller experience. Devote time to the wheeled peripherals that they endorse. Fully utilize or improve their laser scanning technique because as of right now, there's zero road feel compared to ACC. And I know the fanboys are gonna cry and moan about this, I'm not saying ACC is better or perfect. Check my post history if you care to, I'm consistent on that front. But I just ran the Nurburing back to back on both titles and it's not even a comparison. ACC washes GT7 as it pertains to the track itself being feeling alive. I'd like to see them lean into the sim side of things, while keeping the current level of \"sim\" for the arcade mode.\n\nThe online experience and how daily races, time trials work and perhaps other things you come up with?\n\nFirst and foremost, implement a penalty system that isn't trash.\n\nStop making us wait 2 hours between races.\n\nOther things to make the career mode in your eyes âbetterâ?\n\nSophy alone will make the career mode a different beast, if they can realize it's potential.",
      "# [Why Itâs Time to Move On from Roam Research and Embrace New Tools by Ann P, medium.com on 2024-10-20](https://medium.com/@ann_p/why-its-time-to-move-on-from-roam-research-and-embrace-new-tools-ed678d911971)\nRoam Research was once a popular choice for organizing thoughts with features like bi-directional linking and a non-linear approach.

These templates can be customized to suit your requirements, providing a personalized experience.\n\nWhile some may find the abundance of features overwhelming, others see it as an opportunity to customize their workspace according to their preferences. The balance between complexity and customization is something many users find worthwhile, especially if theyâre moving away from Roam Researchâs simpler setup.\n\nIn essence, if youâre seeking a tool that can handle both everyday tasks and larger projects â where everything is managed in one place â Notion might be the upgrade you didnât realize you needed.\n\nObsidian: The Power of Offline Knowledge Management with a Graph-Based Interface\n\nWhen it comes to note-taking and managing knowledge, Obsidian is a strong alternative to Roam Research. What sets Obsidian apart is its graph view feature, which allows users to visually map out their notes and ideas, creating a network of interconnected thoughts. This powerful visualization not only helps in understanding complex relationships between concepts but also sparks creativity by revealing unexpected connections, similar to how mind mapping enhances creative thinking through visual organization of information.\n\nCustomization for Personal Preferences\n\nAnother area where Obsidian excels is customization. Users have the ability to tailor their workspace according to their personal preferences. This includes choosing themes that align with their aesthetic tastes and implementing plugins that enhance functionality. Such flexibility caters to diverse user needs and makes Obsidian a tool that evolves alongside your note-taking habits.\n\nWhy Choose Obsidian Over Others?\n\nWhy consider Obsidian over alternatives like Notion or Amplenote? For those who prioritize offline work while exploring intricate idea networks, Obsidian offers an unmatched experience. Its focus on privacy and data control is appealing for security-conscious users.\n\nHowever, while Obsidian is popular for its flexibility and features, it may not suit everyone. Many alternatives might better fit individual needs.\n\nAmong modern note-taking tools, Obsidian challenges the notion that âRoam Research is Ancient,â promoting a future of intuitive and personal knowledge management. For those struggling with forgetfulness despite advanced tools like Obsidian, solutions such as the Constella app can assist in effectively managing notes and tasks.\n\nAmplenote: Boosting Your Productivity with Integrated Task Management Features\n\nAmplenote is a powerful alternative to Roam Research among modern note-taking tools. It stands out by combining note-taking and task management features, providing a comprehensive solution for personal productivity. With Amplenote, your ideas are not just left hanging but are organized into actionable tasks.\n\nNote-Taking Redefined\n\nIn Amplenote, note-taking goes beyond simply writing down thoughts. It creates an environment where ideas and tasks are connected, ensuring that nothing gets forgotten. The tool is built to turn messy thoughts into well-organized action plans, making it an essential tool for those who thrive on being organized.\n\nStay on Track with Calendar Integration\n\nOne of Amplenoteâs standout features is its calendar integration. By syncing your notes with a calendar, it offers a visual timeline that helps users stay focused and meet deadlines effectively. This feature works like a personal assistant, gently reminding you of your productivity goals without adding unnecessary stress.\n\nAmplenote shows why some people see Roam Research as outdated; it innovates by addressing current demands in flexible task management and user-friendly design, offering a fresh perspective on productivity tools that could reshape how we handle our daily tasks.\n\nRemNote: Transforming Learning and Memory Retention with Spaced Repetition Techniques\n\nIntroducing RemNote, a tool that seems to have cracked the code for efficient knowledge retention. Its secret weapon? The use of spaced repetition algorithms. Imagine having a digital assistant that knows exactly when to nudge your memory, ensuring you never forget essential information. How many times have we wished our brains came with built-in reminders? RemNote makes that dream a reality.\n\nBut RemNote isnât just about playing memory games; itâs also about creating a smooth journey through your thoughts. With its unique backlinking capabilities, users can effortlessly navigate between related notes. Picture it as having an intricate web of ideas at your fingertips, where each thread pulls you closer to mastering complex topics.\n\nFor those whoâve found themselves frustrated by the simplicity and limitations of Roam Research, RemNote offers a refreshing alternative. Itâs not just another note-taking app; itâs a learning companion eager to enhance how you absorb and connect knowledge. Move over, Roam Research â RemNote is here to redefine what it means to truly know something.\n\nTana: Advanced Organizational Features for Complex Note Structures You Can Easily Manage\n\nTana is a great alternative to Roam Research, offering a sophisticated approach to organizing complex note structures. If youâve ever felt lost navigating through a digital maze of notes, Tanaâs powerful tagging system might just be your guiding star. Tags in Tana arenât just labels; theyâre tools that allow you to categorize and filter information with precision and ease. Imagine having the ability to cut through your data jungle and find exactly what you need, when you need it.\n\nBut what really makes Tana stand out is its block-level transclusion. This might sound complicated, but itâs a game-changer for note management. Transclusion allows you to dynamically link different parts of your notes. Itâs like having pieces of a puzzle that can rearrange themselves depending on the picture youâre trying to build at any given moment. This feature not only enhances flexibility but also ensures that your information remains interconnected and coherent.\n\nAnytype: Prioritizing Security without Compromising Functionality in Your Note-Taking Experience\n\nIn the world of note-taking tools, Anytype stands out by addressing a concern thatâs becoming increasingly important â data security and privacy. While tools like Notion, Obsidian, Amplenote, RemNote, and Tana focus on enhancing productivity through various innovative features, Anytype takes a different approach by ensuring your data is protected with local storage and encryption measures. This commitment means that your notes are stored directly on your device rather than in the cloud, offering peace of mind for those wary of potential data breaches.\n\nOpen-Source Transparency\n\nBeing an open-source platform, Anytype promotes transparency and community collaboration. Users can explore its codebase, ensuring that no backdoors or unwelcome surprises exist within its architecture. This openness not only builds trust but invites contributions from users eager to enhance the toolâs capabilities.\n\nA Modern Alternative to Roam Research\n\nWhile Roam Research is outdated in tech terms due to its lack of native mobile support and performance issues, Anytype emerges as a modern contender that doesnât skimp on functionality. Its emphasis on privacy makes it a compelling choice for anyone seeking secure yet efficient alternatives to Roam Research. With resources like this comprehensive guide on how to maximize your productivity with Anytype, users can fully harness the potential of this dynamic tool. So why stick with the old when you can explore these dynamic options?\n\nEmbracing New Tools for an Optimized Note-Taking Experience Beyond Roam Research\n\nSwitching from Roam Research to newer tools is like upgrading from a flip phone to a smartphone. Modern alternatives offer noticeable performance improvements, addressing common grievances about Roamâs sluggishness. These cutting-edge tools provide innovative features such as AI-powered semantic search, meeting the evolving needs of users seeking more than basic functionalities.\n\nThe rise of AI-powered note-taking has significantly transformed productivity. Consider how these tools cater to dynamic user needs:\n\nSemantic Search: AI-powered search functions mean that finding your notes is not about remembering exact phrases but understanding concepts and ideas.\n\nCustomization Options: From block-level transclusion in Tana to Obsidianâs graph-based interface, customization allows each user to tailor their experience.\n\nIntegration Capabilities: Seamless integration with calendars, task management systems, and other productivity tools ensures a cohesive workflow.\n\nThese features collectively create an optimized environment for knowledge management, making the transition from Roam Research not just logical but essential for those seeking efficiency and innovation in their daily processes.\n\nConclusion: Itâs Time To Move On From Roam And Embrace A New Era Of Note-Taking Tools!\n\nThe tools weâve explored, from Notion to Obsidian, each offer unique capabilities that cater to the dynamic and multifaceted needs of modern users.\n\nWhy settle for limitations when you can unlock potential?

You're not max leveling the full roster in a week.\n\nWhile still faster than an mmo. That sounds boringlybtedious. I might hate the game repeating the same quest 1000 times to do that lol\n\nMy first time and day in Jeuno and the first 6 hours of it is spent staring at a chocobo's butt.\n\nVyss posted...\n\nWhere it says \"Equipment Rank Restriction\" is the maximum level of gear you can obtain based on your player rank. I'm not sure it actually lowers your stats.\n\nFree Roam works in a similar fashion you can get gear based on your rank if you go to the right area.\n\nBut you wont get gear above your rank fighting things above your rank.\n\nFor some reason I thought this applied to your gear stats too, lol. I haven't really done super lower quests with stronger gear to notice a difference sadly, I only do lower tier quests if a aid request pop up but usually grinding char ranks for passives so not paying too much attention to my damage.\n\nhttps://psnprofiles.com/FioreAmaya | http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/1893663/\n\nGrinding is love, grinding is life.\n\nantoinejones posted...\n\nWhile still faster than an mmo. That sounds boringlybtedious. I might hate the game repeating the same quest 1000 times to do that lol\n\nI don't think it's quite that many times, but it will be a bunch of times.\n\nEven just grinding out the first co-op quest on repeat looking hunting the cosmetics is giving me over a full Character Rank each run. With S-Rank and MVP it's close to 1.5 levels in a run. It's just more about how many times you need to wait for a stage to start, and then make sure you get the character you want, and then run it and go do it again. I'm only getting 2-3 runs an hour right now, so it all depends on how much time you have to dedicate to it I suppose.\n\nIf you have an abundance of free time and not much else to do you can probably knock out 2-3 characters to 100 in a week. But that's some serious dedication.\n\nThe amount of exp you need to rank up starts increasing past 30 for chars, so it starts taking much longer to rank up compared to the rank 1-30. Unless you're really going ham and being extremely efficient, you're not getting multiple chars to 100 in a week.\n\nAfter 30, the amount needed to rank up is 2k, not sure what rank the next increase is but I know it eventually becomes 3k to rank up after that. Boss Raids tend to give a bit more than co-op quests. Boss raids tend to range from 6.5-8.5min~ ish clear times, whereas co-op tends to range from 9-12~ ish min from my personal experience and from seeing others.\n\nIt's definitely possible to get multiple to rank 100 if you have a fair amount of free time and only do boss raids for time efficiency.\n\nThis is all based off matchmaking on Asia server since that's where the majority of players play due to the queue times/being most active.\n\nhttps://psnprofiles.com/FioreAmaya | http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/1893663/\n\nGrinding is love, grinding is life.\n\nThanks for the update. I was expecting Character Rank amounts to go up eventually but haven't got there yet.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sxkji7DVW5A\n\npassive you can unlock at character rank 30 and what they do that the in game disruptions don't say\n\nHaving a goal is good, but don't let your goal depress you.
