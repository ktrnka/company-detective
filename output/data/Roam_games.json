You appreciate the wildlife, the trees, the weather, the landscape and the music a lot more when you're not blazing past it at 100mph. \n\nBut that's the downside: most game companies are about providing intense action at all times. Very few games want to give the player a slow moment because those are moments that a player is likely to stop playing in. Even comparing RDR1 to RDR2 illustrates this as RDR1, fantastic as it is, plays more like a _video game_ than a _simulation_, which is the core difference in my eyes\n\n### Comment ID gsbh2i9 with +10 score by [(LexB777, Reddit, 2021-03-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbh2i9/) (in reply to ID gsb7qjk):\nReally interesting point. I had considered the slow pacing, but not the fact that you actually move and do things slower.\n\nWhen I first started the game, I found the pacing made me antsy. I kept wanting to go faster, but I *knew* that I would fall in love with this game. I played the ever living shit out of RDR1, over and over again. Same with GTA5 and Skyrim. I'm the kind of player that buys about 1 or 2 games per year.\n\nNow that I'm in the last Chapter of the whole game, I wish I had taken it even slower (even though I have 180 hours logged into the first save, not sure if that's normal but it feels like a lot). I definitely will go even slower on my second play through.\n\n#### Comment ID gsbhj5p with +5 score by [(Joss_Card, Reddit, 2021-03-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbhj5p/) (in reply to ID gsbh2i9):\nThat's what I did. I spent as much time in chapter 2 as I could, doing as much as I could before I had to move the camp.

I loved this despite it being a setting I traditionally don't enjoy.\n\nFar Cry 5: first person shooter with an interesting world to explore. It has many flaws, imo, but can be fun to wander about. The fishing is, imo, better than RDR2.\n\nGhost Recon Wildlands: suggesting this over the newer Breakpoint as it has a better world with the possibility of creating more intense situations.\n\nWatch Dogs 2: all three games are on ps4 but 2 in my opinion has the best map for exploration and the most potential to create interesting situations.\n\n## Comment ID h6s73ef with +12 score by [(DarkIxis, Reddit, 2021-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/h6s73ef/) (in reply to ID oszpl5):\nDays Gone is the sandbox I'm trudging through, good mechanics, decent story, and lots of exploring.

      "# Post ID 1amz7sx: Recommendations for games like Genshin. (Single player; free roam; exploration with puzzles) with +4 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/)\nHi,\n\nDo you have any recommendations for games like Genshin Impact. I mean: single player mainly; free roaming open-world and exploration with puzzles.\n\nFrom what I know:\n\n\"Zelda Breath of the Wild\" and \"Tears of Kingdom\"\n\nImmortal Fenyx Rising\n\nWuthering Waves (not yet released but I still count it)\n\n* What I do **NOT** look for:\n\nGames mainly focused on multiplayer (example: Tower of Fantasy) (I have a bad connection, so my ping is quite bad. It's still okay when Internet is only a bit required like Genshin, but once other players are involved, I often have a lag of a few seconds)\n\nNon free-roaming games (example: Honkai Star Rail) (The puzzles often make me feel like I found a rubik's cube on the side of the road instead of the puzzle being hidden and part of the world. What I am looking for is to explore, find secrets and be rewarded for solving them; all that in a fluid way, instead of the puzzle interrupting my freedom of movement).\n\n* What make no difference for me:\n\nCombat: Combats can be action or turned based\n\nClimbing: There can be no climbing. It can even be no jumping. As long as the environment allow falling from edges to find secret (think Dark Souls. No real jumping, but you can find a lot of secrets anyway\n\nDoes anyone know of games like that?\n\nEdit: For more precision: What I am looking for is environmental puzzle; puzzle where you still control your character to solve the puzzle. Not puzzle that feels more like a minigame totally separated from the main gameplay.\n\nAnd the feeling I am looking for is: you explore the world, find a puzzle out in the wild. You try to solve it; if you can't solve it, no problem, you can just return to it later. The other puzzles aren't locked because you didn't complete the previous ones; while at the same time you find puzzles through exploring, it's not a serie of room with puzzle in each of them.\n\n## Comment ID kpphbg1 with +9 score by [(Due-Distribution-463, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpphbg1/) (in reply to ID 1amz7sx):\nFallout 4 and Skyrim are the best open world games although both are graphically out of date. There are no real puzzles in either of them which is a big plus in my book. Puzzles are too artificial.\n\nSubnautuca is a great open world game but it has no real combat or NPCs to interact with.\n\nHogwarts Legacy is similar to Genshin.\n\n### Comment ID kpqejsw with +4 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpqejsw/) (in reply to ID kpphbg1):\nExcept, I am looking for the puzzles.

Wow, I never thought about it, but *yeah*, the Tallnecks ARE puzzles, where you have to observe the terrain and the machines guarding it, then approach carefully. \n\nMany fights are also puzzles, as (unless you play on the lightest difficulty) it's best to start stealthy and go noisy only when you're not going to get attacked from four different directions. Stealth games are IMHO partly puzzle games where you're trying to solve how to move from point A to point B with a minimum of fuss. \n\nThe sequel has a LOT more puzzles, some of which I remember very fondly; climbing up a pair of overgrown skyscrapers in San Francisco or delving a ruin in the remains of Las Vegas.\n\n#### Comment ID kptrxtg with +1 score by [(Toutanus, Reddit, 2024-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kptrxtg/) (in reply to ID kpphrd1):\nForbiden West has more puzzles\n\n## Comment ID kppgsqd with +5 score by [(Mar_ZP, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kppgsqd/) (in reply to ID 1amz7sx):\nI'm not sure it matches your description but I'll throw it anyways...

Oblivion and Morrowind, too.  Elex is essentially a double-A version of this, if you're really desperate. \n\n\nA bunch of open world jrpgs would match your criteria, too. Try xenoblade, modern final fantasy, etc. \n\n\nDark souls is even heavier on combat and lighter on puzzles than skyrim, but some are free roam. Elden ring is similar, but with much more free roam than dark souls. \n\n\nFallout and starfield could be stretched to meet your criteria. Puzzles are almost non existent tho. \n\n\nAt this point, you're running out of games. Nier and Nier Automata are less free roam than you'd like, and have no focus on puzzles.\n\n### Comment ID kpvoi0q with +3 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpvoi0q/) (in reply to ID kpqiicx):\nI am looking for these puzzles. I am looking for the type of games where you explore, then suddenly, a wild puzzle appears. If you can't solve it, you just return to it later. But the puzzle is environmental, you are still in controls of your characters. A lot of JRPG have the \"rubik's sube\" feeling: you no longer control you character, and instead control the puzzle. It's often because map movement/interaction is limited.\n\nOne of the rare exception for JRPG, is Golden Sun. There are a lot of good puzzle but you are always in control of your character.\n\n## Comment ID kpp5fad with +2 score by [(SnakeTGK, Reddit, 2024-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpp5fad/) (in reply to ID 1amz7sx):\nIsland of insight is gonna release soon (free demo up right now).

Great memories of sword only and that one bow challenge in the inazuma quest where java spent days to get around it. \n\nOfc without an audience you don't have that much of an incentive to not cheat if you're stuck but you can give you hard penalties, e.g. 1 cheat costs a 10pull on the standard banner or something like that. \n\nBut that's just if you're reeeeaaally into a challenge, otherwise it'll likely burn you out\n\n### Comment ID kpvi8lg with +2 score by [(Ovnidemon, Reddit, 2024-02-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1amz7sx/recommendations_for_games_like_genshin_single/kpvi8lg/) (in reply to ID kpr0ifs):\nI am more looking at something casual.

It's kinda free roaming but not a true open world, to open some area you have to play the story first just like genshin\n\n\nThe puzzle, well.. the puzzle is tied to the exploration.

It's not totally open world but there are several expansive areas that you can go to find stars. There are little guys you need to fight off, but no character building. There are a ton of puzzles that you can play and ditch if you want to work on other puzzles (all give you stars so that you can fight the boss and move to the next area). It's 1-2 player, more fun with a friend to play as his hat lol.\n\nI was OBSESSED with this game and I felt the same level of obsession when I started playing Genshin.

That's the jg.\n\nJg is basically roam+. You do what roam does and then some extra. On one hand, you're probably going to be using heroes that have some of the most obnoxious power spikes and playmaking potential, on top of two buffs and a fast level 4. On the other hand, that means the team has *you* to look to to find the straws that will break the camel's back, and turn the tides of an even or even a losing game.\n\nThe stakes are higher, too. If the roam is sent to base multiple times or has some bad sets/kill secures, it's fine, they have utility that is nonreliant on maintaining a lead and can always play from behind, leaving the teammates to pull off the heavylifting of damage and objective secure. As jg, *you are the damage and objective secure*. If you go down, if you can't find a way to outplay your enemy or lose your lead, your entire team is probably doomed.\n\n## Comment ID lnugpd7 with +8 score by [(Maximum-Shrimping, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnugpd7/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nA good roam makes jungling easier. \nA good jungle makes winning the game easier. \n\nThey coexist.\n\n### Comment ID lnugukq with +1 score by [(NoobzProXD, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnugukq/) (in reply to ID lnugpd7):\nThis one seems to be the most reasonable, mlbb is a coop game after all\n\n#### Comment ID lnuhnos with +6 score by [(Maximum-Shrimping, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuhnos/) (in reply to ID lnugukq):\nI have 1 thing to add. \n\nPeople that think roamer is easy are also the same one that thinks that roamer should babysit gold lane.\n\n### Comment ID lnuipzs with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuipzs/) (in reply to ID lnugpd7):\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o180is0uwopd1.jpeg?width=449&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=279ade612825bc2c8c3b510b8ac522207084671b\n\n## Comment ID lnu8o1l with +10 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnu8o1l/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nYes it is.\n\nCome on all roles are important but the fact that a Jungler can guarantee you a lord and turtles is what it makes challenging and important \n\nAnd yes Roaming IS the easiest role for me\n\nYou can say roamers die protecting their teammates, but that is uncommon, mostly after a gank or set roamers survive, with low health but they do\n\nRoamer is least likely to be killed \n\nSurvival is the easy part\n\nBut to use their skills to set up cc and change the game is really difficult\n\n### Comment ID lnuaewf with +6 score by [(MiloCAD, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuaewf/) (in reply to ID lnu8o1l):\nYes, perhaps roamer is easier, but finding a decent roamer is like finding a needle in a haystack.\n\n#### Comment ID lnuakg1 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuakg1/) (in reply to ID lnuaewf):\nOf course\n\n### Comment ID lnuhwl3 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuhwl3/) (in reply to ID lnu8o1l):\nhaha, by reading this I know you don't roam that often.\n\n### Comment ID lnuynfk with +1 score by [(Rgamingchill, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuynfk/) (in reply to ID lnu8o1l):\nI'm both a good Jungler and a good roamer. I can assure you roaming is harder unless you are playing very high skill cap junglers such as Fanny. \n\nIf your teammate dies while they are behind you, it's your fault. If the mm hiding behind the tank is pierced through the tank, it's the tank's fault. If your Jungler is bonkers in the head you have to do his part of ganking too. \n\nOn the other side, junglers can hide under the excuse they were farming or that the ganking of a lane isn't I  their rotation. If the roamer babysits a lane, it's a Jungler's job to gank the other. More often than not, if both Jungler and Roamer are in a single lane, the enemy team will win one of the others. \n\nTL;DR Jungling is more lightheaded outside objectives.

It cannot be said low because I have got many mvp  by roaming.\n\nBut it doesn't mean roaming is easy. Roamer might not need quick thinking as a jungler but it still requires decision making on where to be. \n\nAll in all, no role is easy.\n\n## Comment ID lnugcdt with +1 score by [(Past_Matter_6867, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnugcdt/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nJungling is the last role to play but makes understanding the game easier\n\n## Comment ID lnugrm9 with +1 score by [(GzusiakanU, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnugrm9/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nJungle is stressful, roamer is kinda but if you're a good roamer and knows what you're doing it's definitely a win.\n\n## Comment ID lnuhgoo with +1 score by [(Kotarosama, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuhgoo/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nI play all lanes and roam pretty frequently, with jungler relatively my weakest role. Imo, yes for most matches in normal ranked games, junglers need to manage farming, ganking, dictation of teamfights and securing neutral objectives, all the while dealing with random variables like whether the mage and roam is on point and helping to defend against jungle invasions/providing vision etc, and also needing to read the flow of your laners, to provide extra assistance and attention if your laners are particularly weak to their counterparts either by drafting compatibility or skill gap.\n\nRoamers on the other hand, simply need to provide vision, stuns and/or support, defend against or support jungle invasions, and frontlining in teamfights but majority of roam players cant do that even decently, while always looking to blame someone for problems of their own making (usual targets for verbal abuse being MM and Jungler). Proper roamers also do not need to farm, so that takes a load of pressure off their shoulders (not considering assassins mainly as assassin roamers are pretty gimmicky, and usually work out lesser the higher the elo, not to mention that it usually attracts players with terrible roamer competencies even if they are good at the hero). Also roam hero mechanics are amongst the easiest while jungler heroes tend to be more dificult relatively on average, so its pretty difficult to argue in any dimension that roaming is harder than jungling in usual circumstances.\n\nHowever, thats a little different in the pro scene, because most pro players are near the very limits of their effective capacity and rarely makes any fundamental mistakes in their roles. Rather teamfights are the nexus event that determines whether the game is won or lost, and roamers have a outsized role when it comes to teamfight initialisation, frontlining or disrupting the enemy's flow by clouding their judgement and forcing them to use skills at the wrong time. Kills are also rarely secured 1v1 in that level due to the high competency of everyone on that level, which means any kill from another person at least involves the mage or jungler, but probably the roamer, so roamers play incredibly important roles in the pro scene, serving as the difference makers. That doesnt apply to most people on this subreddit however, even MI wouldnt be close to the pro scene standard.\n\n## Comment ID lnuj1m3 with +1 score by [(Present-Difficulty-6, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuj1m3/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nThere’s a reason why Roams are the usual captains/shotcaller of the team.\n\n### Comment ID lnv19pp with +1 score by [(Tenmashiki, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnv19pp/) (in reply to ID lnuj1m3):\nThey are the shotcallers because it is not as micro intensive, allowing them to focus their attention on the overall flow and macro and make decisions from there.\n\n#### Comment ID lnvbl3s with +1 score by [(Present-Difficulty-6, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnvbl3s/) (in reply to ID lnv19pp):\nExactly why I think Junglers are harder to play..

A good Jungler with a bad roamer can't win a game by themselves against half-decent players. I've seen that firsthand in my games, either me or a team mate was Jungling and the roamer was awful, or in the enemy team where they had a great jungler and a God awful roamer. The jungler has higher expectations on their shoulders, but they need a roamer to pull them off. You can steal infinitely many objectives if you are good with retri, a bad roamer will make all of that useless. \n\nFurthermore, if a Jungler is bad, what they fail to do falls on the roamer. If a jungler wastes Retribution, it's the roamer who is expected to delay or halt the enemy team from taking the objectives while the cooldown is on. A roamer can often salvage something from a Jungler's mistake, which isn't true the other way around. \n\nLet me put it this way. Roaming is easy to learn, hard to master, while Jungling is hard to learn, but easy to master. As such, In the middle Point of the learning curve, Roaming definitely feels(and is) harder. That is, of course, not the case if the roamer in question is not a setter tank.\n\n## Comment ID lnv0sdv with +1 score by [(TerracottaaBanana, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnv0sdv/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nNeither they both are equally hard the roamer have the utility to be useful in the game no matter what stage they are in and jungler have DPS  to be useful in the game no matter what stage but they gotta to see care of objectives while roamer take care of other imo they both basically support each other as a role (I play both roam and jungle) I always ask for my roam to babysit me or I babysit my jungler until 5 minute and feed him roamer and jungle are the same role with different objective if you really think about it too they both roam they both support teammate while jungle put Damage on the table, Tank put utility so they are equally hard but if I have to choose I would say roam because they can't solo carry like jungle\n\n## Comment ID lnv3cjw with +1 score by [(LandscapeFeisty951, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnv3cjw/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nAs a roamer I think jungler is harder.

Sometimes, the Mid-Laner has no choice but to let the invade happen, or maybe they're just dumb and don't understand the matchup. Wild Rift is very young, so most people don't have every bit of knowledge unlocked.\n\nNow, don't argue that you've played LoL PC before, I did too, but there are several nuances that are different in this and that. We have no starter items, no potions, but we have honeyfruit in the lane, the lane is shorter, etc. The macro concepts are similar, but it's still a different experience than in PC.\n\nIs this an excuse for the people who don't know Macro? No, I've beaten challengers by applying Macro several times before, and when I'm negligent about macro and the enemy team knows how to, I will lose even to Emerald players. But we haven't perfected Wild Rift the same way that we've perfected the art of PC, it may take a few more years before we see WR Challengers have the same skill as PC Challengers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THIS IS WHERE THE ACTUAL EXPLANATION BEGINS**\n\n \n\nThere are several reasons why Mid-Lane just can't come over to help you, but the two I want to talk about is Priority/Lane State, and Matchup.\n\nPriority and Lane State - Picture this, you're a ranged Mid-Laner vs an assassin, who do you think gets priority in this lane? 9 times out of 10, you should have total control of the wave if you're playing it properly. Every time he steps up or goes for CS, he should lose his HP for being so disrespectful. In this lane, you have priority, and the lane state should be pushing into him, now let's transition to the next concept.\n\nMatchup - Picture this, you're a Lee Sin vs. Evelynn, and your Mid-Laner is Orianna vs Akali. No one is level 5 yet. Now, Orianna has Akali pinned down under tower, she's shutting down any attempts she makes and she's forced to be stuck under tower until 5. \n\nBut let's reverse the roles for a moment. You're now Evelynn, your Akali is stuck under tower, she has a big cannon wave to collect, and you're here dueling LEE SIN of all people for scuttle. You see Orianna coming over to help Lee beat you up until you see grey. You should've conceded earlier, but you need to leave NOW. You don't. You die, and there's nothing Akali could've done for you there. You need to pay attention to the matchup, you shouldn't even show your face to Lee Sin at all, and Orianna is a ranged champion vs Akali in early game, you shouldn't expect anything to happen cause she can't do anything. Just because your Mid-Laner didn't come to help you, doesn't mean she's stupid, the circumstances just didn't allow her to do anything about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow all of those things I told you about?

Roaming is matchup reliant. There is absolutely no point in let's say a Ziggs following an Ahri in to the river. Some champs are build to roam, and some aren't. It's up to the rest of the team to identify that and acknowledge that if enemy mid is off the map then play safer, because your mid doesn't have as much agency. \n\nNot that a ziggs should never roam, but by design, the champion is better at sieging than roaming for kills. Othe thing to consider is 2v2 matchup. If you're expecting your mid to rotate, when you're Evelyn and Lee Sin and for example a zed rotate and you're expecting your Kayle mid to come help. Yes people troll when not roaming when they should, but also people troll just as much taking skirmishes when they have no idea how the 2v2 matchup *should* work. - then blame mid for not rotating.\n\n### Comment ID hr5eoyp with +1 score by [(BlitzBlotz, Reddit, 2022-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr5eoyp/) (in reply to ID hr1z8g7):\n>There is absolutely no point in let's say a Ziggs following an Ahri in to the river.\n\nDepending on the situation you should clear the wave which shouldnt take more than 2/3 sec for ziggs and than follow ahri through your jungle, not river to the lane she tries to gank so you can ult into the gank if necessary.\n\nI see so many Ziggs players not utilizing his almost global presence properly.\n\n#### Comment ID hr77n61 with +1 score by [(Awwbelt, Reddit, 2022-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr77n61/) (in reply to ID hr5eoyp):\nAgree maybe walk to *your red buff* and use Ur ult as support damage. Then more than likely return to mid and attempt to take plates and deny waves. You will more than likely lose a 3v3 as ziggs - because he's suited to siege. Not roam. Nothing you have said counters my point, and in fact you agree ziggs shouldn't walk down river with Ahri. \n\nThat alone gives Ahri time to gank while I'm still walking through my jungle. Ziggs isn't a roamer. Ori isnt a roamer. Some champs want to deny waves instead.

TF however can roam even though he's not a strong early game champ because he can teleport. Galio is also a roaming mid because he's pretty good early and has teleport. Assassins should try to win lane and roam whenever possible because they have mobility to move quickly to other lanes or escape from enemy jungler when caught, need kills to snowball, and are usually quite strong in the early game.\n\nMy experience being a midlane Orianna main for the last two seasons is that when I roam too much, my gold advantage just disappears even though my jungler helped me get first blood. So when I face a relatively equal matchup, I rarely roam unless a fight around neutral objectives is happening, or I am very certain that I can get a kill or help my teammates get a kill when roaming (enemy laners are very low on hp, skills on cooldown, overpush, enemy jungler is in the opposite lane, laners/jungler are ready to skirmish, etc.)\n\n## Comment ID hr208a3 with +2 score by [(BLAST_V, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr208a3/) (in reply to ID rur90t):\nIts mostly lane priority\n\n## Comment ID hr1818o with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/rur90t/mids_that_dont_roam/hr1818o/) (in reply to ID rur90t):\nI only roam after t1 mid is down.

Multiplayer wasn't internet, unfortunately, and I think the game might have been old enough to have IPX as an option lol.\n\nAbsolutely my favorite campaign mode of any jet sim ever, unmatched to this day. \n\nInterestingly, the whole premise of the sim was that you could fly either the X32 or X35 (yes, this sim came out *before Lockheed won the contract* ) to compare the two, theoretically. Neither of the VTOL variants made an appearence, and the X35 did not have the modern big screen instrument panel it has today.\n\nAlso, after ejecting you could walk around and shoot things with a handgun that was terrible to aim lol. Since they didn't want to bother developing an FPS weapon, they gave the handgun Vulcan rounds!\n\nWorth a look just to see what sims could have been.

Actually this experience would be a lot better at night but you have to worry about the cops. But Palm City is an awesome map with a Miami aesthetic and it carries the atmosphere hard. The driving is also decent and the roads are really good.\n\nIf you like piss filters, Most wanted 05 is actually not a bad game for free roam, Rockport is a surprising great map with varied locations, great roads and a great driving model, but not at slow speeds relative to your car. If you want to just fly through through the city to keep adrenaline going, Most Wanted for you. \n\nI think the best free roam game might be Carbon. Palmont is not that big, especially compared to the later games. But goddamn is the free roam experience so good. The atmosphere is amazing, great roads and the city is pretty good, it has really cool locations that great to cruise and explore in. Only problem is that it may feel kinda small. Plus it's got a banging soundtrack and the driving is also great, albeit sense of speed's not as good as MW 05 but still good. And sometimes there are cars that would just pull up on you and want to race you. You do have to be wary of cops though, but you can avoid, and you pay to lower your heat later at the safe house. And if you do get into a chase, it will be a good one imo.\n\n## Comment ID kre54pz with +1 score by [(Saiibox, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/1avkd0v/best_nfs_game_to_free_roam/kre54pz/) (in reply to ID 1avkd0v):\n2012 easy no contest\n\n## Comment ID krfddry with +1 score by [(JS-CroftLover, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/1avkd0v/best_nfs_game_to_free_roam/krfddry/) (in reply to ID 1avkd0v):\nNeed For Speed Most Wanted 2005\n\n### Comment ID krvw9e0 with +2 score by [(dark_fesse, Reddit, 2024-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/1avkd0v/best_nfs_game_to_free_roam/krvw9e0/) (in reply to ID krfddry):\nmain issue with mw05 free roaming is that a single accident (hitting anything on the map) will pretty often result with the cops being called and coming to find you\n\n#### Comment ID kryjsfs with +2 score by [(JS-CroftLover, Reddit, 2024-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/1avkd0v/best_nfs_game_to_free_roam/kryjsfs/) (in reply to ID krvw9e0):\nThat's why I always drove the cars responsibly, around Rockport 😃\n\n## Comment ID krjo5dv with +1 score by [(xkhloerodimusx, Reddit, 2024-02-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/1avkd0v/best_nfs_game_to_free_roam/krjo5dv/) (in reply to ID 1avkd0v):\nMw2012\n\n## Comment ID ksmdh1u with +1 score by [(codycbradio, Reddit, 2024-02-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/1avkd0v/best_nfs_game_to_free_roam/ksmdh1u/) (in reply to ID 1avkd0v):\nUnderground 2 for the free roam without cops.

LB2 has 3 main sections of the map. I played this game on the Wii and it was great with only one issue. \n\n---\n\nPros are:\n\n- There is plenty to do around the map\n\n- Multiple vehicles are fun\n\n- The physics are fun to play with\n\n- The flying characters fit well but I feel don't make the driving irrelevant. \n\n- The world is mostly flat but there are tall buildings which can be accessed by flying characters or helicopters\n\n- The character switching is great compared to older titles\n\n---\n\nThe cons are:\n\n- There are few interiors but these are made up for by the open world map\n\n- The boats lack a lot of purpose but are fun enough\n\n- The wii issue - The islands are split up in loading screens however when I watched videos of XBOX plays, these did not exist. I imagine it is only a Wii thing, but do your research on your desired platform\n\n- The game is fit for it's time, so don't expect high quality textures. I played in sweet Wii 480p though, so again research. \n\n- The game didn't feel repetitive when I played it years ago and the atmosphere was quite good indeed\n\n---\n\nI would highly suggest Lego Batman 2 to most people however I do not know of the quality on other platforms other than the Wii.

The downside is that the open world itself isn't that interesting aside from a few areas and you'll spend a lot of time flying over it anyway.\n* In LotR and Hobbit Middle Earth won't fully unlock until you've beaten the story, but given both stories are about groups of people on long journeys that's part of the appeal. The character rosters aren't that interesting but still have a decent amount of variety, and the item system gives you a neat mix of customisation and extra abilities so you aren't restricted to a handful of characters with key abilities. Hobbit's version of the world is different to LotR's, and is more detailed as well.\n* The Harry Potter games let you explore Hogwarts (and a few other areas in the sequel). If you're a fan of the series it's probably the best open world since there's so much backstory and flavour associated with the locations. Most of it is unlocked by about the midpoint of the game. Unfortunately the character roster is fairly small in terms of unique characters, since a large chunk of the characters are either duplicate versions of the main trio or are other students (all of whom have essentially the same abilities).\n\n## Comment ID f84kzgt with +6 score by [(Msozod, Reddit, 2019-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/dyv9g3/which_lego_game_has_the_best_free_roam_world_in/f84kzgt/) (in reply to ID dyv9g3):\nLego batman 1 is not a free roam game but it is my favorite lego videogame\n\n### Comment ID f84mpmw with +6 score by [(arczclan, Reddit, 2019-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/dyv9g3/which_lego_game_has_the_best_free_roam_world_in/f84mpmw/) (in reply to ID f84kzgt):\nThe split stories for Heroes and Villains was fantastic!\n\n#### Comment ID f84ms0q with +3 score by [(Msozod, Reddit, 2019-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/dyv9g3/which_lego_game_has_the_best_free_roam_world_in/f84ms0q/) (in reply to ID f84mpmw):\nYeah and the story and gameplay was great!\n\n## Comment ID f8483y0 with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/dyv9g3/which_lego_game_has_the_best_free_roam_world_in/f8483y0/) (in reply to ID dyv9g3):\nMarvel superheroes or hobbit\n\n## Comment ID f84xvwg with +3 score by [(TheCheshireCody, Reddit, 2019-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/dyv9g3/which_lego_game_has_the_best_free_roam_world_in/f84xvwg/) (in reply to ID dyv9g3):\nInteresting that nobody has mentioned LEGO Jurassic World, which didn't have *the best* free roam, but had an enormous map encompassing all three islands and all of the major set-pieces of the films. You could even stomp around as any of the game's dinosaurs (larger dinos were restricted to certain areas, but smaller ones could go anywhere) or swim around as a Mosasaur!\n\nAlso, LEGO Avengers has something like eight sizeable areas to roam around, and Manhattan alone is simply enormous.\n\n### Comment ID f850ozv with +1 score by [(DevaPain7, Reddit, 2019-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/dyv9g3/which_lego_game_has_the_best_free_roam_world_in/f850ozv/) (in reply to ID f84xvwg):\nI’ve played Jurassic World. I really like its atmosphere because I’m a fan of dinosaur. I’m also surprise that nobody mentioned it.\n\nBtw the Mosasaur area is underwhelming imo.\n\n#### Comment ID f8512p9 with +4 score by [(TheCheshireCody, Reddit, 2019-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/dyv9g3/which_lego_game_has_the_best_free_roam_world_in/f8512p9/) (in reply to ID f850ozv):\nThere's only so much you can do with a creature that has to live in a tank of water. It's not like they were going to create an entire oceanscape for a single dino, and a Mosasaur has limited functionality anyway - it can't do anything more than swim around and eat stuff. I just really appreciated that the devs created that section in the first place.\n\nIt occurs to me that the game with *truly* the best free-roam is one nobody has mentioned: LEGO Dimensions. The hitch, obviously, is that all of the various free roam sections need to be unlocked with the purchase of additional characters, but the total amount and variety of roamable territory you can unlock simply trounces every other game.\n\n## Comment ID f84bbmk with +2 score by [(Fan_of_Lego, Reddit, 2019-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/dyv9g3/which_lego_game_has_the_best_free_roam_world_in/f84bbmk/) (in reply to ID dyv9g3):\nI think the Harry Potter game let you run around Hogwarts and around the castle, which was pretty fun.

      "# [A Weekend Guide To Scarborough And The Yorkshire Coast Of England — ROAM WHERE by Rachel Boyles on 2023-03-08](https://www.roamwhere.com/blog/a-weekend-in-scarborough-the-yorkshire-coast-of-england)\nWhy Visit Scarborough And The English Coast\n\nFish and chips. Ice cream. 2 penny slots. Coastal hikes. Lighthouses. Just a few of my favorite things every time we go to the seaside.\n\nWhen I told a few friends from London that I was going to Scarborough for the first few days of the New Year they asked why there. The question caught me off guard, but then it reminded me that just because my family is familiar with an area doesn't mean others are. England has 7,000 miles of coastline, so every region in the country will have the seaside town they're closest to or most likely to visit. Scarborough and the surrounding northeast coast is where my husband's family spends most of their seaside time because the area is quaint, nature-filled, and only a few hour’s drive.\n\nIf you're visiting England for a week, it's easy to have a full itinerary, but time by the sea is special and gives you a glimpse into English seaside culture. From super cute, charming towns with fish and chips and antique shops to long swaths of beach and coastline to hike up and down, it would be a miss not to visit. This post specifically focuses on Scarborough and the surrounding Yorkshire area, but don't let that limit you! If you only have a short amount of time, seek out the coast closest to you and use this post for inspiration of things you can do, because many of these activities aren't unique to Scarborough. That said if you fall in love with the views in the photos, and you have the time, Scarborough is one hundred percent worth your time.\n\nThis post includes affiliate links.

Most times we've visited the seaside have been solely chosen because we've visited family. And more often than not, we're visiting for the holidays in the winter, so I've had my fair share of winter seaside days. No matter the weather, whether it's rainy and cold or sunny and breezy, I've enjoyed every visit.\n\nThis most recent seaside escape took us to Scarborough. Every time I visit my husband's family, they always try to take me somewhere new to me but familiar to them. In past visits, we made it to Whitby, Robin Hood's Bay, and Staithes, and somehow I hadn't made my way to Scarborough yet. Since we were looking for a base for a few day’s visit versus just a day trip, it was the perfect option with lots to do. We visited the first few days of the new year with the hopes of \"clearing out the cobwebs\" (as my father-in-law likes to say) with fresh sea air and nature views.\n\nExplore The Harbor And Seafront\n\nWe spent most of our time in Scarborough walking along the seafront of the South Harbor. It's the main location for restaurants, games to play, and beach walks. On our first day, we started at the St. Mary's carpark and walked the half-mile path past the Scarborough castle and down to South Beach Bay. You get a good view of the sea and the town while also admiring the castle walls. Once at the Bay, we walked down the boardwalk along the beach and then came back along the other side of the road to look over the shops and restaurants.\n\nWe visited over the winter holidays, and it was a bright sunny day, so the beach was packed with people. We realized we weren't the only ones who thought being by the water would be a great way to start the New Year. Even with the masses, I was still enthralled with it. There is just something so uniquely distinctive about UK seaside culture, and Scarborough has it all. Full families walking along the waterfront together, everyone with either fish and chips or ice cream, bundled up in coats and hats, all in front of a backdrop of bright signs, tourist shops, and the waves crashing in the distance.\n\nOn each of the two nights we stayed in Scarborough, we also came down to walk along the harbor. The harbor front is also home to many 'casinos'(?) with 2p slots (more on that below), so that was also our evening entertainment.\n\nAll of this to say, it's the thing to do in the place. Just go for a walk and observe at the very least.\n\nPlay 2p Slots\n\nI can't write this post without talking about 2p slots. If you're from the UK, you most likely don't need an explanation. But as an American, I find them unique, almost perplexing, but also incredibly fun and addictive. Basically, they have games that cost a 2 penny coin to play. For most machines, as you and others play, the 2p coins pile up in the machine. The goal is to knock a jackpot worth of coins or some small trinket into a hole below so you can collect it. A jackpot worth of coins is what I always dream of, but I'm not sure if anyone has won more than £1 (= 50 x 2p coins) in one go from these games. And the trinkets are usually things like little animal figurines or whatever the new cheap trendy toy is. (This time the toy in fashion was the push pop keychains, but I could imagine a past where Tamagotchis were on offer.)\n\n2p slot 'casinos' offer a lot of fun for £1. You can search for the machine that looks the most primed, try out what you think is the perfect angle that will win them all, and even attempt different techniques like pushing in a lot of coins all at once or doing them one at a time. Each time we would win a trinket, we would comment on how if we bought it ourselves it would be much cheaper than what we spent winning it, but it's the journey, not the destination.\n\nWhat makes these so peculiar to me is that they're basically lightweight gambling. I felt myself thinking if I just play one more pound I'll crack this machine and get a windfall, but as I said, I'm not sure if that ever happens. But that 1% of hope keeps me coming back and trying again. Even worse, the real deal slot machines are just beyond an 18 or older line on the ground. Signaling once you're old enough, you can play for bigger money.\n\nAnyways, they're (or at least can be) cheap fun and signify a day at the seaside. Enjoy yourself but go in with a budget of £5 or so and keep your wits about you.\n\nGet Fish And Chips\n\nWhere To Walk And Hike / What To Do / What To See In The Area Around Scarborough\n\nThis section wasn't easy to title, because visiting the seaside is often a ‘choose your own adventure’. Looking to walk through a quaint coastal village? They have that. What about a rugged coastline with lots of hiking paths? They have that too. Or what about a wooded hike inland? Yup, there's also that. At each of these places, you can take it at your own pace and explore it the way you want to best.\n\nVisit Flamborough Head\n\nI was blown away by this place. I don't know if it was because I had experienced withdrawals from not traveling and exploring somewhere new, or if really it is that impressive, but I thought it was beautiful. Ultimately, I didn't know what to expect, but it's like a smaller version of the White Cliffs of Dover. In other seaside visits, usually, we're in the harbor so I don't see the rugged coastline as much, so I think that's why this surprised me so much.\n\nIt has easy and ample parking up by the lighthouse. From there, you can hike down to the water and walk around the base of the chalk cliffs and along the rocky beach as you explore the cavernous areas. You can also walk along the top of the cliffs and look at the rolling green meadows ahead and the water crashing below. Even better, we came upon a bay full of seals. We were looking down at them from above, but it was fun to stumble upon them. I also JUST read while working on this post that you can spot puffins from mid-May to July. I might have to return just for that!\n\nA quick disclaimer on tide times\n\nWhen visiting the coast, it's important to keep an eye on the tidal schedule, because, in most locations, the beach is completely covered by a few feet of water during high tide.\n\nA tidal win: We visited Flamborough Head at the perfect time because we were able to explore a large part of the beach and even explore more corners of it by walking around rocks. Not even 30 minutes after we were there, the path around the rocks had waves covering the path. And an hour or two later, the beach would not have been accessible.\n\nA tidal loss: We planned to visit Filey on our way back to Scarborough from Flamborough Head. It made sense logistically, but we didn't watch the tidal schedule. We parked where the family normally parks, which gives you a nice walk along the water into town. Well, we walk down to the beach and end up seeing the water coming all of the way into one of the areas that juts out before we get onto the beach. We contemplated and watched others make attempts. A family on their walk back from town filled their boots with water and a woman got muddy climbing up and over. So we decided against it and went the longer route up and around.\n\nFalling Foss / Foss Falls\n\nThis destination takes you inland, so it's a nice contrast to all of the time near the water. Because it's off the beaten path, it's definitely an adventure. We chose it based on a recommendation from my sister-in-law who had hiked it before. When she came the first time, the path she took was challenging, so this time we searched out a slightly easier path. Slightly is the keyword here, but no matter the difficulty level, it made for a fun family bonding experience. Most of us got mud on us some way or another.\n\nWe started the path by looking down at the waterfall from above, and then we took the long path walking away from the falls for quite a while. We started to zig zag our way back and down to the floor of the waterfall. At the point we reached the stream, we could hear the waterfall but we couldn't see it. This is where things got a little confusing. We tried crossing over the stream and then walking along it, but the path took us away from the falls again. So we scrambled our way back down to the stream, off trail, and then had to find an area of stones or a fallen tree to cross back over. All of that to say we had a fantastic time, spent the afternoon out in the forest, and overcame many hurdles we thought would stop us along the way. The falls are beautiful, and I bet it's fun to take a swim when it's warm in the summer.\n\nThese next three destinations I've visited on other trips to the UK, but they're nearby Scarborough and so worth exploring:\n\nRobin Hoods Bay\n\nSpeaking of quaint villages, this is definitely one, if you can't tell by the name. It's built into the fissure of two hills with winding cobble stone alleyways and sandstone houses. It's a fun walk down to the sea and then you can explore along the beach. We went here a few years back, but it was my first time seeing this coast, and this particular area really stuck in my heart and mind.\n\nWhitby\n\nOne of the more famous stops along the coast, Whitby is known for the remains of the once-large Whitby Abbey as well as the home to Bram Stoker while he wrote Dracula. Whitby has a decent size city center with lots of shops and restaurants to explore. It's very picturesque because it's split by the River Esk which flows into the North Sea, and on either side of the bridge you get a great view of the city, full of brick and stone buildings with their red roofs. This is a fantastic place to stop for fish and chips. We usually get ours at Mister Chips by the beach and eat it outside at the gazebo. As a reminder, keep an eye out for seagulls (they will swoop down and take a whole tray of chips from you). My other favorite stop in Whitby is to get a cup of tea from the tea stall. You can get it in a real mug while you observe the city across the water. Super cute and very English.\n\nStaithes\n\nA much smaller village to visit, in my mind I think of it similar to Robin Hood's Bay. When we visited, we walked through town, by the bay, and along the breakwater. It has lovely views of cliffs that create a nice sheltered harbor that contributed to it becoming a village.\n\nWhere To Eat In Scarborough",

      "# [Wahoo ACE Cycling GPS In-Depth Review: The Best or Unbaked? by Ray Maker on 2024-12-03](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/12/wahoo-elemnt-ace-in-depth-review-bike-computer.html)\nAfter years of waiting, we’ve finally got a new Wahoo cycling GPS – and it’s a beast. At least, in terms of size and weight. And in the future, Wahoo also hopes in terms of features and position in the market. The new unit sports a full color touchscreen display, roughly similar to that of cell phones, while also including a speaker, bike-bell, and wind sensor. Of course, like other high-end bike computers introduced this year, it also includes a much higher price tag – $599USD.\n\nUnfortunately, to spoil this review – it’s half-baked. It’s missing a vast array of features that previously existed on every other Wahoo bike computer to date, it’s even missing features listed on the front of the box and marketing site, and the battery life falls far short of claims. I’d argue this is the perfect product to see which reviewers are actually riding with it, versus just taking pretty shots of it.\n\nBut, we’re getting ahead of ourselves here. I’ve been riding the crap out of it, everything from near-daily 3-4 hour rides, to mountain biking, structured workouts, gravel riding, and more. All with the goal of figuring out what actually works.\n\nFinally, note that this unit is a media loaner, and once this review is complete, it will go back to Wahoo. As always, I don’t accept advertising from any company I review – so, if you found this review useful, consider becoming a DCR Supporter, which gets you an ad-free site, plus the behind-the-scenes video series between both myself (and my wife) on everything that happens in the DCR Sports Tech Cave/universe.\n\nHow it Differs:\n\nIn some ways, it’s hard to compare a watermelon to a kiwi, as that’s roughly what it’s like comparing the Wahoo ACE to a Wahoo ROAM. So yes, while both are fruit (bike computers), beyond that, they are actually quite a bit different – both good and bad. Still, assuming the standard Wahoo bike computer as a baseline (which is a massive assumption as you’ll see), here are the most notable differences:\n\n– Increased size of unit a cargo-ship-sized boatload\n\n– Increased screen size to 3.8” (2.7” on ROAM V2)\n\n– Increased screen colors to 16 million (64 colors on ROAM V2)\n\n– Added touchscreen capability\n\n– Added a very loud bike bell (digital)\n\n– Added voice navigation prompts\n\n– Added wind sensor\n\n– Added new sensor pairing dashboard\n\n– Added map layers option\n\n– Added street names on maps to (some) streets\n\n– Added Activity Profiles (e.g., Road/MTB/etc…)\n\n– Added time to upper edge, and always-on/seen\n\n– Revamped ‘Ready to Ride’ dashboard\n\n– Changed to Wahoo App (from Wahoo ELEMNT App)\n\n– Changed a ton of the user interface\n\n– No more lights/LEDs along upper edge\n\n– No Live Tracking yet (firmware update in H1 2025)\n\n– No Strava Live Segments yet (firmware update in H1 2025)\n\n– No more full-route elevation view (coming in TBD update)\n\n– No more filtering of routes on device (coming in TBD update)\n\n– No more naming of saved locations (coming in TBD update)\n\n– No more custom alerts (e.g., hydration/nutrition alerts, coming in update)\n\n– No more choosing location on Wahoo App map to route to (only device)\n\n– No more changing gear ratios (electronic shifting) in new Wahoo app\n\n– No nacho cheese dispenser\n\n– No TrainerRoad Outside Workouts at present (‘coming soon’)\n\n– Increased battery life claim to 30 hours (Note: This isn’t even vaguely close to real, as I’ll show)\n\n– Increased internal storage from 32GB to 64GB (for maps)\n\n– Included new aluminum mount (versus plastic previously)\n\n– Removed screw for bike computer to mount (allowed UCI Pro teams to count unit weight as bike weight)\n\n– Price is $599USD/$849CAD/€599EUR/£549GBP/$999AUD/¥99,000JPY\n\nNow, when it comes to features that are in the pipeline, Wahoo has confirmed some of them, per the table below, though, many of the ones listed above don’t have exact dates yet.\n\nThe first set is these updates not in the 2025 table:\n\n“Planned December 2024 Updates. A post launch update will take place in December. This update will include the following features below:\n\n– Strava Live Segments\n\n– Offline configuration support (to supplement cloud based architecture)\n\n– “Workout Profiles” rebrand to “Activity Profiles”\n\n– Additional UI/UX Refinement and bug fixes”\n\nAnd then the second category is this, for H1 2025 and H2 2025.\n\nFor example, language support includes focusing on French, German, Spanish, and then the remaining 14 languages Wahoo currently supports. Today, it’s only English on the ACE. For advanced route management, that’s allowing you to ride routes on a trainer, while showing the virtual route location on your map on the ACE.\n\nIn the case of the battery optimizations, they’re aiming to strike a better balance between the 5-second timeout mode, and the Auto mode, basically in hopes of getting the battery life better within Auto, versus the only way to get good battery life today is 5-second mode (more on that later).\n\nFor H2, they’re looking at additional map layers such as custom POIs from Strava or Komoot, as well as some functions around the wind sensor, including breaking out how much power is required to overcome the grade (on a climb, steep or otherwise) vs wind (which might help on positioning). These are all certainly interesting ideas. Though, I fear some of these aspirations could become derailed with trying to get all the existing features ported first, before they can focus on new items.\n\nSo with that, let’s get into the box.\n\nIn the Box:\n\nFirst up we’ll quickly get the unit unboxed. Inside, you’ll find the ACE just chilling:\n\nBut here’s what’s inside the box once you get rid of all the paper. Kudos to Wahoo in that there’s no plastic in the box.\n\nInside you’ve got:\n\n– The beefcake of a bike computer (ACE)\n\n– The beefcake of a metal mount\n\n– The lanyard to tether the ACE in case it snaps the mount\n\n– The USB-C cable to charge it\n\n– A warranty paper you’ll never read.\n\nHere’s a few close-up shots of all those things.\n\nOk, let’s get into the size. Or, over the size. Or, wrap ourselves around the size.\n\nThe Size:\n\nLike it or not, the size is going to be a polarizing aspect of the Wahoo ACE. And it’s near impossible to understand in photos. It’s not really due to any singular dimension, but rather, the complete girthiness of it. It’s a tank in all ways.\n\nOfficially it measures 208g on the scale, but it’s mostly the thickness and width you’ll notice. Here’s how it looks side-by-side:\n\nThe thing is, I’m a unique duck here. I’m used to all assortment of stupid-large things on my handlebars for testing, including drone remote controls and more. So frankly, the size actually doesn’t bother me. Neither does the weight.\n\nHowever, it’s impossible not to notice it. It’s huge. Wahoo says much of the size is to account for the larger battery, which in turn provides it with a claimed 30 hours of battery life (a number I can’t get *anywhere near* in my testing).\n\nWhen it comes to mounts, it has much the same problem as the Edge 1050 did at launch – it needs an XL mount of some sort. In Wahoo’s case though, that’s actually twofold. First, it needs a strong (realistically metal) mount to support the much heavier weight. Very heavy, so heavy in fact that Wahoo is specifically not designing a GoPro adapter for the bottom of their mount because the combined weight will likely snap it (after hitting a pothole or cobbles).\n\nHere’s their stock mount on my mountain bike:\n\nThe second piece is the length. It needs to be long enough to handle that, which is longer than the Edge 1050, but because the mount is centered differently than the Edge 1050, it can squeeze into most Edge 1050 compatible mounts. But barely. In the case of my Canyon bike with the stock Canyon out-front mounts, it basically skids (physically touches) across the handlebar as I rotate inwards:\n\nBut it does get in there, after snuggling. And that particular mount is designed to support a light on the bottom, so it’s used to the weight. Though, I haven’t tried it with both Wahoo ACE + Light to see if it’ll snap. Here’s to hoping it doesn’t.\n\nThe point is, this will be frustrating for some users (actually, many users) who want to mount a GoPro or other action camera below. The combined weight is simply well beyond what any mount on the market today is going to safely handle (I’ve snapped metal mounts with far less weight on them). Hopefully we’ll see some viable Ace+GoPro mounts soon. After all, Wahoo does have GoPro action cam control on the unit.\n\nRiding Basics:\n\nProbably the first thing you’ll need to know is now you’ll be using Wahoo’s new bike computer app on your smartphone, simply called ‘Wahoo’. Previously with their bike computers, you used the Wahoo ELEMNT app. But over the last year or two, Wahoo’s been slowly moving devices under the consolidated Wahoo App instead. At a high level, this works. But if you’re a long-time Wahoo user, you’ll quickly find the gaps for which there are no solutions.\n\nWithin the Wahoo app, you’ll pair up the Wahoo ACE, as well as link any partner accounts you have, like Strava, TrainingPeaks, or Komoot. However, the list is a bit messy right now. A number of the existing Wahoo partners aren’t working in the new Wahoo app/platform, which is required for the ACE.\n\nFurther, one thing that’s rather silly, is that by default, it won’t automatically upload your completed activities to each of these platforms. You have to expand out the box and check ‘Auto-Share’. Why?!? So much why.\n\nWithin the Wahoo app, you can set up heart rate zone, and power zones (plus bits like metric/imperial/custom display of measurements).\n\nNext, this is the first Wahoo cycling computer to support sport/bike profiles, such as creating a set of data pages for road cycling, and a different one for mountain biking. To do so, you’ll open the Wahoo app, and then select to ‘Add Workout Profile’. Here you’ll choose something within the ‘Cycling’ category, in order to get it to show up on the ACE:\n\nHere I’ve created a Mountain Biking profile, where I can then configure workout pages, alerts, general settings (such as Auto Lap), as well as heart rate zones:\n\nWhen it comes to workout data pages, there’s a boatload of options as before, both in terms of custom data fields, as well as dedicated pages like Music Control, GoPro Control, and Strava Live Segments (when that feature gets rolled out in a few months).\n\nAnd, because someone in the comments section got really angry that I didn’t show how many data fields the map page can display, here ya go, all the data fields – including the elevation data field at the bottom, and wind on the side.\n\nOnce you’ve got all that configured, you can then select it at the top of your ACE:\n\nAfter which, all of your data pages/settings/etc will be available for that ride.\n\nBut here’s the (extremely annoying) rub: This won’t correctly tag the ride type on Strava or other platforms upon upload. The *singular* feature that people have been asking for, for countless years, Wahoo hasn’t completed. Thus everything is listed on Strava as a generic ride, unless you go on Strava and manually toggle it to Mountain Bike, Gravel, etc…\n\nWahoo says that adding in the correct sub-type is on their near-term radar, but they don’t have a timeframe for it. Keeping in mind, this is literally just a single field in the .FIT file they have to set.\n\nNow, one of the things you’ll notice is the new sensor pairing menu at the bottom. This shows your paired sensors, and whether or not they’re connected. It even has nifty-proper icons for each of them.\n\nIn fact, kudos to Wahoo here. Not only did they make picture-perfect icons for all their own devices (e.g. Wahoo POWRLINK Zero power meter pedals look like Wahoo speedplay pedals), but they also did it for at least some other power meters. For example, the Garmin Rally pedals look roughly like Garmin Rally pedals. Quarq cranksets and Favero power pedals just look like generic crank arms. Still, well done Wahoo.\n\nWhen it comes to shifting, you can pair up both ANT+ Shifting (e.g. SRAM eTAP/AXS) as well as Shimano Di2. In the case of both, you can use the remote shifter buttons to change data pages or set a lap marker. However, at present the new Wahoo App doesn’t support customizing gear ratios like the Wahoo ELEMNT app did.\n\nNow, that said, I will note that it seems to take a little longer than I’d like to find sensors sometimes. Not a huge deal, but it’s not quite as instant as Wahoo’s other devices or Garmin/Hammerhead. Sometimes it’s more like 20-30 seconds before it seems to notice its sensor friends are awake.\n\nStill, once it finds it, I’ve had zero issues on all my rides across numerous bikes, including: SRAM AXS RED XPLR (and FORCE AXS), Shimano Di2, Quarq power meters, Favero Assioma MX power meter, Garmin Rally power meter, Wahoo TRACKR heart rate sensor, Garmin HRM-PRO Plus HR sensor, and Garmin Varia RTL-515 radar.\n\nSo with all that configured, let’s go and ride. Again, I’ll cover navigation later on. As you ride, you’ll see your data pages automatically displayed. You can swipe through them using your fingers, or press the page button:\n\nYou’ll notice above the coloring for my heart rate and wattage, this is based on my zones. It’s a nice touch that Wahoo has, and also appears in other fields, like gradient.\n\nWahoo also has the concept of increasing/decreasing data field quantities. Meaning, by simply pressing the up/down buttons (on the right side), it’ll change how many data fields are displayed on the page, per the priority you set on the app. As you do this, it’ll change how big each field is. Such as below:\n\nNote that while Wahoo got rid of the LED bar seen on past Wahoo computers, it does retain much of that same concept through colorized data fields and a strip that updates at the top of the screen. Further, I appreciate always having the time displayed at the top of the screen, no matter what data page you’re on. They also use that area to display upcoming turns (albeit, kinda late usually).\n\nNext, regardless of whether you have a route enabled or not, you’ll automatically get upcoming climb information. As you approach a climb, it’ll automatically trigger and show you details of that upcoming climb, such as this:\n\nYou’ll see details about the gradient displayed within the color of the chevrons on the map. You can tap through a few different data pages that show details about the climb.\n\nNext, you can execute structured workouts from Wahoo’s own app, or TrainingPeaks. At present, TrainerRoad is not yet supported. As part of the migration to the Wahoo App, these connections haven’t been completed yet. And others are missing as well. TrainerRoad says that’s coming soon.\n\nIn any case, you can open up the structured workout on the workouts page to see a list of scheduled workouts. In my case, I manually created one in TrainingPeaks, since my TrainerRoad ones weren’t coming through anymore.\n\nAs you execute it, you’ll see details about each step automatically, and alerts accordingly…sometimes. You see, there’s a ton of bugs here.\n\n– Skipped showing the progress bar during the warmup\n\n– Didn’t show any interval alerts if I wasn’t on the interval page (so if I was on another data page, zero notification of the start of an interval) [Update: It apparently does, except that option is now hidden deep in a menu setting, and set for default off. Why? WHY?!?!]\n\n– Didn’t adhere to TrainingPeaks ‘pause till lap’ option\n\n– Didn’t show my current power line, as Wahoo’s own marketing site says it should\n\nI do like the little pop-over at the bottom, but again, it only shows on the workout page, which kinda defeats the point of a popover.\n\nAnd here’s Wahoo’s page (main Wahoo ACE site), indicating I should be seeing my actual power line shown, but it doesn’t work either:\n\nFinally, with everything finished, you can end your ride. Here you’ll get a ride summary screen, with information as such:\n\nThat said, one super frustrating piece is that despite having the new activity profiles (e.g., Mountain Bike, Gravel, etc…), none of those carry into Strava. Wahoo isn’t setting that attribute like all of their competitors are, and thus, you’ll still need to update these in Strava after the fact.\n\nNonetheless, all of your data otherwise does appear correctly there.\n\nThe Bike Bell:\n\nI was going to include the bike bell within the ‘Basics’ section above, but I figured I’d break it out. If for no other reason than to have one section that’s mostly positive.\n\nSomewhat humorously, Wahoo seemed keen to hide its best feature. All of Wahoo’s initial PR efforts almost entirely ignored the bike bell. Thankfully, at the last minute, they changed their mind. The Wahoo digital bike bell allows you to double-tap the screen to instantly hear a very loud and audible bike bell sound. It’s virtually indistinguishable from the Garmin Edge 1050 bike bell/sound.\n\nIt’s hard to visually show you the bike bell, because there’s no menu item. It just exists audibly, and as noted, you can double-tap anywhere on the screen to make it sound instantly. Well, sorta.\n\nAs long as that screen isn’t the map screen. For some odd reason, it doesn’t work on the map screen. Or the workout screen. Or the elevation screens. Wahoo said that was because there were concerns about people using touch on that map screen and thus accidentally ding-donging. Except, by default, touch on the map screen is already disabled (it has that little lock icon at right). Thus, no amount of rubby-rubby would have moved the map anyway. Certainly, simply unlocking the screen would have disabled the bike bell? Or, using the accelerometer to detect a double-tap would have been possible, no?\n\nIn any event, that (moderate) annoyance aside, the bike bell is awesome. You can also tap just below the pause button in the center of the screen:\n\nOne other thing to note about the bike bell is that it’s *always* at full volume. Meaning, no matter what settings you configure the rest of your audio alerts for (e.g. a less imposing volume), the bike bell remains the same volume. I actually appreciate this.\n\nHowever, I should also mention that unfortunately there is no method to configure the bike bell from the shifter buttons like on the Garmin Edge 1050 (or Hammerhead Karoo 3), which allows you to configure the extra shifter/bonus buttons to trigger the bike bell, which is super cool. Hopefully Wahoo will add that down the road.\n\nNavigation:\n\nWhen it comes to navigation, the ACE can route much the same as past Wahoo devices, though, there are some differences to be aware of that we’ll dive into.\n\nFirst though, is getting routes to your device. For most people, those routes will come from platforms like Strava, Komoot or other 3rd party entities. That said, you can import GPX/FIT/TCX files directly into it, using the Files app on your phone, and opening it with the Wahoo app. Or selecting a previous route from history.\n\nOnce that’s done, it’ll show up on the ‘Routes’ listing on your device, such as this:\n\nThat said, at the moment, this Routes listing is a giant shaker bottle of routes, without any ability to order the routes. In my case, I had Strava routes from years ago imported in, which is fine. But what’s not fine is that I can’t sort them in any way. I can only search them by name, which then requires me to remember exactly what I named each route that someone else might have created. Most bike computers, including all of Wahoo’s existing ones, have a sorting option at the top (such as by Date, A-Z, Starred, Length, and Proximity – as is the case on the Wahoo ROAM V2).\n\nDespite showing this on Wahoo’s marketing site, it’s not there today:\n\nWahoo says this will come at some point, hopefully soon. This is one of a number of examples of things being shown on the box, that are not on the unit in real-life.\n\nIn any case, once you’ve managed to find your route and select it, you’ll see an elevation profile and overview of the route.\n\nI do appreciate the easy option to ‘Reverse’ the route though, something that despite all logic and years of requests, doesn’t exist on a Garmin Edge series device (but does exist on their wearables).\n\nWith the route loaded, we’ll head out riding. If we were to look at the map page first, you’ll see the route as a series of chevrons on the route line. Moreover, the color of those chevrons indicates the climb gradients as you ride along, which is clever/handy:\n\nI do appreciate the coloring and map styles here. The way Wahoo has selected to colorize the different bits of info on the map screen (such as other streets/landscapes/etc…) makes this screen really easy to understand, and the thick chevrons make it easy to confirm your direction at a glance. That said, when dimmed (as effectively required to get half-decent battery life), it’s much harder to read.\n\nIf you tap the layers icon, you can adjust various map layers, including points of interest, custom waypoints, street names, wind, and Summit Segments. Note that in this context, ‘Wind’ doesn’t mean an overlay of the wind direction/forecast, but rather, just wind from the wind sensor.\n\nNote that Wahoo does include street names now on some streets. I haven’t quite figured out the exact pattern to which streets it shows them on, and which zoom levels. While some people love street names on maps, I rarely use them either way – likely because I’m more interested in the actual route line itself, which Wahoo does a good job on. I think they’ve found a good balance between the coloring of the map and the clarity of the chevron line.\n\n(Top: Wahoo ACE, left COROS Dura, right Hammerhead Karoo 3, bottom Garmin Edge 1050, right handlebar – badly in need of new bar tape.)\n\nLikewise, you can tap to enable the cue sheet as well at any time, if you’d prefer to see that:\n\nIn the event you’re on another data page (not the map page), and you have an upcoming turn, it’ll show a turn written prompt and give you an audible alert, and even voice directions to turn.\n\nBut again, there are two problems here. First, by default, none of these occur. You need to enable these voice turn alerts in the settings. Why on earth navigation and voice prompts aren’t enabled by default is beyond my pay grade.\n\nHowever, that gets to the second issue, the speaker volume. To be very clear: The speaker is loud AF (which is great for certain things). Seriously, it’s bone-jarringly loud. So loud your riding buddies will quickly try and body-check you into the nearest herd of cows they can find.\n\nFear not though, Wahoo has a solution for that, the volume slider. This slider has three levels: Loud AF, blah, and unbearable.\n\nFor navigation voice prompts, Loud AF is OK. I’d quibble that the voice should be slightly higher pitched, so it’s easier to hear in the wind, but that’s an easy change they could make. However, once you go down to the middle option, the voice is impossible to hear in the wind. And while the bike bell ignores the volume settings (as it should), there isn’t a way to separate voice prompt volume from the rest of the beeps your unit makes.\n\nAgain, their competitors have two sliders for a reason here: Voices are harder to hear in the wind than high-pitched beeps. Anyone who’s gone on a ride with friends knows this.\n\nIn any case, back to our ride. The next piece is your route profile that’s showing the elevation profile up ahead, seen at the bottom there. That elevation profile shows the next 2KM of your route….and only the next 2KM of your route:\n\nWhile past Wahoo units allowed far greater lengths than that (cough…the entire route), the ACE is limited here to 2KM.\n\nOnce again, the Wahoo box (and everything on the Wahoo site) shows this enumerating the full route as an elevation profile (showing ’Total’). And again, I’m not trying to be nit-picky here, but rather illustrating that this unit simply isn’t ready. Hard stop.\n\nI know this may come as a surprise to some: But stop shipping products that don’t do what it says on the box and your marketing site. Simply delay. The fastest way to get a reviewer angry is to literally not do the thing printed on the front of your box.\n\nNext, when it comes to on-demand routing, you can save locations at any point and navigate back to them, as well as drag to a point on the map (on unit) and route to it. Both of these are under the ‘routes’ option, then ‘Route To’ option).\n\nThese worked perfectly fine, and instantly, for me. Except the ability to rename saved waypoints, that doesn’t work at all right now. Thus, it’s just named whatever random street name you tapped (not ‘Home’ or ‘Work’ or ‘Hot Dog Stand’). Wahoo says that’s on the way too, though that too is listed as being a current feature on their marketing site.\n\nLikewise, the ability to select a point on the map from the Wahoo app doesn’t work either anymore (coming soonish). However, you can send a location from Google Maps or Apple Maps to the Wahoo app, and that worked intermittently for me.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that there are existing navigation providers that Wahoo hasn’t yet ported to the new Wahoo app yet. There’s no timelines on these, other than the second half of next year. But exactly which ones are getting re-added isn’t clear.\n\nThe Wind Sensor:\n\nRepeat after me: This is not an aero sensor, this is not an aero sensor, this is not an aero sensor.\n\nIt is however, a wind sensor capable of measuring wind speed coming into it. And while most aero sensors have that same starting point, that’s about where it ends. In fact, the jump from measuring aerodynamic drag is massive – but not so much hardware, rather, software and user education. It’s why almost every company that enters the cycling aero sensor landscape has failed. And almost all of those remaining that haven’t failed, have invariably pivoted towards coaching services instead. So get aero sensor out of your head, and let’s focus on what it actually is.\n\nInstead, the Wahoo ACE has a wind sensor for measuring the wind speed, then combining it with your known ground speed, and calculating whether you’ve got a headwind, tailwind, or some sort of drafting boost. It calls this “Wahoo Wind Dynamics”, which admittedly makes me giggle a little bit like a 6-year-old boy and think about the “wind dynamics” after eating Taco Bell.\n\nWhile riding, Wahoo gives you a single color-coded data field, titled Airspeed, which is shown in either Airspeed MPH or Airspeed KPH, just like the below (lower half is Airspeed, I’ve added ground speed to the upper half):\n\nThe coloring is basically the following groupings:\n\nThe idea being that you can quantify how much you’re saving when you tuck in behind someone to draft, because you’ll see those two numbers differ. If the AirSpeed is higher than the ground speed, you’ve got a headwind. If it’s lower, you’ve either got a tailwind or are drafting.\n\nI could then take the ground speed number, compare it to the airspeed number, do some mental math, and figure out exactly what the wind speed is (tailwind or headwind). Which…is yes, as silly as it sounds. To me, I shouldn’t have to be doing mental math on a ride constantly. It should simply do this automatically, and instead show me the final number – as either a headwind or tailwind/draft.\n\nAt the end of the ride, you’ll see the numbers shown on the unit with percentages of time spent in the different color-coded zones (labeled as either AirBoost or AirDrag):\n\nMy complaint here isn’t adding a wind sensor to the Wahoo bike computer. Instead, it’s that it’s just not providing any value beyond what I already know. And the singular area it could have provided value (showing impacts of drafting), is far too cumbersome of a number to be constantly doing mental math on. Just give me a number that we’re all calculating in our heads anyway.\n\nLong term, it remains to be seen how Wahoo can leverage this differently. I don’t see any viable path for Wahoo to use this for CdA calculations. Plenty of companies have tried, and given up there. Not because the tech wasn’t ready, but because 98% of riders don’t understand the *VAST* amounts of knowledge required to get proper aero testing done. Silly things like knowing the difference between your shoulders being firm or relaxed will hugely impact testing. Or that moving your fingers 1cm will impact testing. Or doing multiple test runs, etc…\n\nIt’s why virtually every aero sensor company on the market today that started life as a consumer aero sensor company/device, has shifted to being a coaching device, whereby the coach goes and does a seminar first to learn how to use the aero sensor, and then spends an absurd amount of time with athletes ensuring they execute tests correctly.\n\nPoint is, I feel like that weight could have been much better spent on an LED light (even as an emergency light because you’re running behind, or a built-in safety camera (akin to Cycliq Fly12), or…anything else.\n\nNow, all that said, for those geeks in the crowd, I will give Wahoo credit for properly populating the .FIT File with this data. In fact, they populate it with much more data than they show you on the screen. This includes the raw wind speed values, the categorization value (which of those color coded categories above), as well as a power to grade ratio value that they’ve been playing with in Alpha testing (you just don’t see the data field on our units, as that’s not available yet).\n\nIf you load any ACE file into the DCR Analyzer, you can see all this data using the ‘Developer Field’ toggle (which simply shows .FIT file data fields). Here’s the windy ride I did in the Netherlands with the 50KPH winds that day:\n\nNow, there’s a lot to look at. I’ve set my dot/curser at the highest wind point, where you can see the wind categorization is higher. The wind speed is shown in 1000 x m/s (meters/second), otherwise known as millimeters/second. The cool part is the data is there for people to use.\n\nAnd most critically, they do separate out the wind speed component here. Thus, I’d love for them to allow/show me a data field with just the wind speed component too. Note, that if you want to play with that original .FIT file, it’s located under the download link on the DCR Analyzer set page.\n\nBattery Burn:\n\nLook, it’s not good. There’s no two ways to say it. It falls *FAR* short of their claims of 30 hours of battery life, and is roughly in line with the Hammerhead Karoo 3’s battery life when the Karoo 3 is at 50% brightness (which is far brighter than the ACE screen can go). It falls behind the Garmin Edge 1050’s battery burn, and is leagues behind the Edge 1040 or Edge 1040 Solar battery. Again, in real-life numbers.\n\nSo, let’s look at the official claim and then a crap-ton of testing I’ve done. Officially, the claim is simply “up to 30+ hours”, depending on which part of the site you look at. Here’s the quote from their press release:\n\nBut in subsequent conversations, Wahoo clarified the actual claim is ’30 hours of GPS battery life with the backlight in 5-second off setting’. This means that after 5 seconds of touching the unit, the backlight turns off, and is unreadable depending on your lighting conditions. When in direct sunlight – no problems. But in the winter shade? Problems, especially on screens with smaller fonts (more data fields), or zoomed out maps.\n\nEven worse, the default configuration setting for the Wahoo ACE is the so-called “Auto” mode, which basically changes the backlight constantly, though short of summer sun on the beach, it seems to keep it at 100%. In that mode, I was burning roughly 8-12%/hour (across numerous 3-4 hour rides), depending on exactly which screen I was on. Yes, that puts it on target for 10-15 hours of battery life.\n\nThe ‘best’ battery scenario I could muster was 5.71%/hour (thus 17-hours) when I set it for 5-second off, on a mountain bike ride two days ago. Though, one couldn’t see the screen half the time, and given I was mountain biking, it wasn’t like I could just touch the screen easily to see it again.\n\nInterestingly, after a bunch of rides and different configurations, I noticed:\n\n– Plain data field pages obviously burned the least battery, though, if they had any color blocks in them (e.g. zone changing color blacks), they *destroyed* battery life, even more than the map page. This was true even with just two data fields, if one was color (e.g. the wind page),\n\n– There was no meaningful difference in the number of sensors paired impacting battery life.\n\n– There was no obvious difference between having navigation enabled or not, battery life seemed to burn equally.\n\n– None of these figures include LiveTracking or Strava Live Segments, as both are unavailable at this time. Further, none of these figures included screen recording enabled.\n\n– As noted, by far, the biggest impact was which backlight time setting was enabled.\n\nNow, Wahoo says a secondary low-power saving backlight mode is coming in the first half of 2025. This mode will find a better balance between the backlight setting and battery burn. Though honestly, I’m not convinced that’s the issue. I think Wahoo needs to look more carefully at the rest of the code running and optimize there instead.\n\nThe reason I say that, is if we look at the Hammerhead Karoo 3 and Edge 1050, both of which have *FAR* more demanding screens (in terms of battery burn), both can outperform it, even in far brighter settings with far smaller batteries. And then if we look at similar screen technology types, like the Edge 1040, that too easily outperforms it on any setting you want.\n\nPoint is, I don’t really understand why the battery burn is as bad as it is, for as big a battery as Wahoo has. And while I say the term “bad” here despite the Hammerhead Karoo 3 being similar, keep in mind the Karoo is basically half the size, and far brighter.\n\nGPS & Elevation Accuracy:\n\nWhile this review hasn’t been packed with good news, fear not, this section delivers in that realm. The quick version is the GPS accuracy via the dual-frequency GPS chipset, as well as the elevation accuracy, is spot on.\n\nOf course, let’s get into the data. In this case, most of my data sets have at least three other devices running, thus making the full set:\n\nWahoo ELEMNT ACE\n\nGarmin Edge 1050\n\nHammerhead Karoo 3\n\nCOROS DURA\n\nI also had an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and an AmazFit T-Rex 3 on most rides to cross-validate if I needed, but didn’t bother pulling them into these data sets, simply to keep things a little less jumbled.\n\nFirst up, let’s look at a four-hour road ride into the mountains. Here’s the high-level overview, where things obviously look identical:\n\nAfter zooming in on the entire track, it’s basically perfect. Nonetheless, let’s look at some of the mountain switchback sections, just to demonstrate it.\n\nAbove, you can see a descent. The way you can tell is how ‘tight’ the tracks are (or, by knowing my direction of travel…). In this case, the tracks are slightly looser (above), then below, which is a descent. Still, in both cases, the tracks are all within the roadway of the map, and nobody is doing anything funky.\n\nHere’s another very tight switchback section, with complete 180* turns:\n\nOf course, GPS accuracy is only one part of the picture. This route had plenty of climbing on it, and all four units were quite close. I’d quibble that the COROS DURA’s altimeter seems the least accurate of the four in my testing, sometimes being a bit offset, but hardly by much.\n\nWhen it comes to sensor data, I had both a power meter and heart rate sensor connected to all computers, all to the same sensor. Thus, you’d want to see identical data across them. And sure enough, that’s the case. Below is the heart rate graph, merely because it’s a bit “prettier” (easier) data set to look at since heart rate is far more stable than power. Point is, I’m not seeing any data connectivity or capture issues.\n\nFinally, I rarely include ‘totals’ stats in my accuracy sections, because they can be easily misleading. A device can undershoot and overshoot corners and still end up with the same distance as an accurate device. Nonetheless, for fun, here’s the total distance and ascent highlighted here. The COROS Dura is slightly further out on distance than the others, but is in the mix for ascent.\n\nOk, let’s quickly look at another data set, this one a three-hour ride, partially near the sea (some interesting tidbits there on elevation in a second), and partially up into the mountains.\n\nHere on one of the tight switchback sections (ascending), you notice a little bit of variance from the Edge 1050. That makes sense, as I was trying to get some pretty shots of the ACE solo on the handlebars, so the Karoo 3 and Edge 1050 were on my top-tube, and the Edge 1050 was closest to my crotch (with my body blocking it). In case you’re curious, that very photo is the last photo in this review (for the summary section). In any case, despite that, all three were very close:\n\nAnd even in the straightaways, all were fine too (you’d be surprised how often GPS units screw-up straightaways).\n\nThat said, the elevation is actually super interesting. To begin, it’s perfectly fine by most definitions. That said, we notice a few things. The first arrow is alongside the sea/water on the dock. Thus the Edge 1050 is clearly the most correct at 2.4 meters. Whereas the Karoo and Wahoo are a bit high there. However, as I ascend all the units seem to consolidate. The second arrow is where we stopped at a grocery store for about 20 minutes. Notice the very slight altimeter drift there on the ACE. Only about 1-2 meters, but I thought it was geeky interesting.\n\nIn any event, nobody likely cares about 1-2 meters of elevation drift (and frankly, neither do I).\n\nSo instead, let’s look at one more data set, a mountain bike set. This is a blend of trees, some riding near cliffs, and some open terrain. Here’s the overall view:\n\nI wouldn’t say this is crazy challenging GPS terrain (my road rides were actually tougher), but nonetheless, MTB it is (though I have gravel biked this route, but it’s spicy rough).\n\nIn any case, let’s start off with this tree section at a high view. Things look good, right?\n\nBut here’s the kicker when you zoom in: This is actually a loop, with repeated passes (from different directions). Very solid.\n\nHere’s some higher-speed descent stuff (doubled back up too), without any issues:\n\nThe elevation is again fodder for geeks. Those three arrows? It’s when I went down to the beach. I didn’t wheel dip, but was up on the shore at about 2m in altitude. You can see the ACE presents it as much higher at 5m in altitude. Not a huge deal there, though, the 15m offset on one of the climbs is surprising. Albeit, by the second climb, it is perfectly aligned.\n\nIn this case, my geekery aside, overall GPS and elevation on much longer/bigger/complex routes looks very solid. Zero issues there, and the same goes for data sensor connectivity, where I haven’t had any drops or connection issues once paired with sensors.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nCyclists kept asking Wahoo to make a bike computer with a better and bigger display, and on that specific point, they checked the box. In fact, I’ll even agree that their new home screen/dashboard is better than before. And that their map styling pages are very solid. And yes, the bike bell is awesome. Seriously, that’s (by far) the best feature on this unit.\n\nBut in almost every other category, Wahoo simply launched this device too early, and at too high of a price relative to their competitors or the capabilities the ACE has today. It lacks significant features and integrations seen on the Wahoo ROAM V2 or BOLT V2 (their current bike computers), and falls far short of the claimed 30 hours of battery life in my testing. And that’s before we talk about the screen visibility, or the value of the aero sensor. I just don’t understand why Wahoo keeps launching bike computers too early each time, while they stick the landing perfectly on trainer launches most times. There was zero reason to launch this in early December, versus waiting till next March.\n\nIn fact, it seems to be an industry trend this year. We saw the COROS Dura launch far too early, so much so the company then had to repeatedly delay shipping for both hardware and software reasons. We’ve seen startups JESPR and Absolute One also launch at both crazy-high prices and with the feature sets of a 2012 bike computer. Still, Hammerhead did launch their Karoo 3 this past spring to appropriate pricing, finished features with most of the polish required, and solid accuracy. And Garmin also launched their Edge 1050 this past summer at the same price as their previous top-end device, with virtually no complaints from reviewers or consumers alike.\n\nThe problem is, launching unbaked early gets you reviews like this. Reviews that live for *years* on the internet. Sure, perhaps I’ll update it as Wahoo improves in future firmware, but that won’t change the YouTube video, which can’t be updated. And sure, I could publish another YouTube video down the road each month they restore new features, but reviews months later rarely top the charts in consumer searches.\n\nI want companies like Wahoo or COROS to challenge the growing bike computer monopoly. I think both have significant unique things to offer there. In the case of COROS, it’s crazy battery life and extremely good pricing. In the case of Wahoo it tends to be simplicity and ease of use. But launching half-baked products like this only damages their reputation, furthering their competitors’ position.\n\nSigh.\n\nWith that, thanks for reading (or supporting independent reviews like this)!",
      "# [What about an open-world EFT? What is really planned, after all? by brunnodrk on 2024-03-28](https://forum.escapefromtarkov.com/topic/179741-what-about-an-open-world-eft-what-is-really-planned-after-all/)\nWhen I bought the EFT beta in 2017, I used to hear a lot of people talking about EFT in an open world, but today hardly anyone says anything besides speculations.\n\nSome say we won't have an open world in EFT as initially planned, and the final version will be the same as it is today. Others talk about having some kind of \"loading\" for transitioning between maps, which would be equivalent to a different raid in each one. Finally, some speak of a truly open world like DayZ.\n\nAnd thinking about it, the Streets map alone is very heavy. I wonder how having all the maps in an open world would be; it seems quite unthinkable, doesn't it?\n\nSo, what do we officially know today about Tarkov's open world?\n\n2 hours ago, brunnodrk said:\n\nWhen I bought the EFT beta in 2017, I used to hear a lot of people talking about EFT in an open world, but today hardly anyone says anything besides speculations.\n\nOk first to clarify those a bit.\n\nFirst it was suppose to be \"FREE ROAM\" MODE, so it was never intended to replace raid systems.\n\nAccording to some informations from interviews, it was suppose to act as \"1 big raid, without PMC respawns\" At least thats how i understand \"1 big map with 64 players\" but i may be wrong, it was never discussed exactly how it suppose to work.\n\nThen they said that this MODE will be unlocked once we escape from tarkov (finish story)\n\nAnd then, one of last informations was \"Propably instead 1 big map, there are gonna be 2, Streets and all other maps combined, reason is that Streets suppose to be \"as big as all other maps combined\".\n\nHere is post from 2019 where TheWay said it was still in plan\n\n(TheWay was like Main Emissary guy for Europe if i am correct)\n\nAnd i belive that in 2021 @ShiroTenshi did the same. I can't find it, but recently i had a talk with someone and i think i seen such post/comment.\n\nI think it's one of last informations about Free Roam Mode tho or like \"confirmations\" of any kind.\n\n2 hours ago, brunnodrk said:\n\nOthers talk about having some kind of \"loading\" for transitioning between maps, which would be equivalent to a different raid in each one.\n\nYes, at some point Nikita mentioned \"map to map travel\" as idea or place holder (or thats how most of ppl understood him).\n\nSo instead going straight to Labs, you would have to go Hideout -> Streets -> Labs -> Streets -> Hideout\n\nCause you know, not all maps are connected with Hideout and maps overall are connected with other maps.\n\n(fan made, not offical map, just how it \"could\" look like more or less)\n\n2 hours ago, brunnodrk said:\n\nSo, what do we officially know today about Tarkov's open world?\n\nWell, thing is that in 2016-2018 we did belive in such promises, but then with each other map, we (players) seen that such vision is most likely out of reach.\n\nI belive it still MIGHT be plan/idea for Tarkov, but it's not possible to do.\n\nWhy i think so?\n\nWell, imagine having all map combines (beside Streets), having 64 players and like 200 scavs + loot, it would be really bad for your FPS.\n\nOr there is better visualisation. STreets suppose to be \"as big as all other map combined\" so far it's not even near and we achive like 60-90 fps (On good PC) with only 18 players? And like 30 scavs?\n\nWhat i would really love to see, it's HONEST podcasts with Nikita, not those BS which we were getting, where Nikita does not answer 90% of \"good\" questions, just answer to some with \"It's planned\" \"we wanna do this\".\n\nI would love to see WHATS actually planned, a whole list and whats scraped.\n\nCause looking at Old Gameplays/trailers/interviews we have poo ton of content which was shown but it's cut.\n\nexample:\n\n- Customs dorms - Had a light switch (Gameplay trailer from 2016?)\n\n- Streets Primorsky - Had a light switch (One of first Streets Trailer)\n\n- Streets Concordia - Breakable wall (Battle of concorcia trailer?)\n\n- Melle knife kills animation - One of first EFT gameplay trailer\n\n- Grenade explosion effect (Flying debree, doors being opened by explosion) - One of first gameplay trailers\n\n- Lightkeeper announcments - \"FIrst in game TRADER\" meanwhile it's x wipe with him and he still does not sell anything\n\n- BTR on Streets - Having a group of AI riding on it - Streets Expansion trailer\n\n- \"Kolontay guard will have Ballistic shield, most likely either not lootable or that PMC will not be able to leave map with it and they will be in police station\" - Podcast/interview - Not existing in game\n\n- \"Clans will appear with EFT Arena\" - First informations about Arena in 2021 or 2022.\n\nANd way way way way way way more\n\nI just would love to know whats planned for sure and whats removed completly",

      "# [Why It’s Time to Move On from Roam Research and Embrace New Tools by Ann P, medium.com on 2024-10-20](https://medium.com/@ann_p/why-its-time-to-move-on-from-roam-research-and-embrace-new-tools-ed678d911971)\nRoam Research was once a popular choice for organizing thoughts with features like bi-directional linking and a non-linear approach. However, in the fast-paced world of productivity apps, it can quickly become outdated compared to newer tools designed for modern users.\n\nEffective note-taking tools boost productivity by capturing ideas and organizing information. As demands grow, our tools must evolve to avoid hindering productivity.\n\nIt’s time to explore alternatives that not only match Roam’s capabilities but surpass them in innovation and user experience. Obsidian is popular among the best productivity apps due to its Markdown support and unique bi-directional linking feature. However, we must ask: do these productivity apps outperform Obsidian in note-taking?\n\nReady to change your note-taking habits? Discover new tools offering better functionality and flexibility. Let’s explore what’s next in note-taking.\n\nThe Limitations of Roam Research\n\nRoam Research, once favored for organizing complex thoughts, now faces limitations making it appear outdated.\n\nPerformance Issues: Users report slow performance with large databases, affecting productivity.\n\nLack of Mobile Apps: Without native mobile support, on-the-go access is restricted, hindering modern workflows.\n\nSecurity Concerns: Inadequate data protection and unclear policies raise privacy concerns.\n\nThese challenges prompt users to seek newer solutions that better align with current needs.\n\nWhy Users are Seeking Alternatives\n\nThe digital note-taking landscape is evolving along with user needs. As people seek greater productivity, they’re exploring alternatives to Roam Research. Users now require adaptable features for dynamic work processes.\n\nIntegration is Essential: Modern apps demand seamless integration with task managers, calendars, and communication platforms, creating a cohesive workflow and minimizing app-switching friction.\n\nDemand for Advanced Features: Users call for robust features like enhanced collaboration and AI-powered search. While Roam’s minimalist approach suits some, others desire tools offering flexibility and power for both individual and team environments.\n\nTechnology Supporting Growth: The drive to explore new tools aligns with goals for personal and professional growth. The market offers options meeting these needs, signaling an exciting future for personal knowledge management.\n\nTop Alternatives to Roam Research You Should Consider\n\nNotion: The All-in-One Workspace for Seamless Collaboration and Project Management\n\nNotion is a versatile tool that goes beyond just note-taking. It combines various features to create a comprehensive workspace for both individuals and teams.\n\nHere are some key reasons why Notion stands out:\n\nCustomizable Databases: Notion allows users to create databases tailored to their specific needs. This means you can build your own CRM or track projects with detailed data points that align with your workflow.\n\nTemplates Galore: Notion offers a wide range of templates for different purposes, such as meeting notes or product roadmaps. These templates can be customized to suit your requirements, providing a personalized experience.\n\nWhile some may find the abundance of features overwhelming, others see it as an opportunity to customize their workspace according to their preferences. The balance between complexity and customization is something many users find worthwhile, especially if they’re moving away from Roam Research’s simpler setup.\n\nIn essence, if you’re seeking a tool that can handle both everyday tasks and larger projects — where everything is managed in one place — Notion might be the upgrade you didn’t realize you needed.\n\nObsidian: The Power of Offline Knowledge Management with a Graph-Based Interface\n\nWhen it comes to note-taking and managing knowledge, Obsidian is a strong alternative to Roam Research. What sets Obsidian apart is its graph view feature, which allows users to visually map out their notes and ideas, creating a network of interconnected thoughts. This powerful visualization not only helps in understanding complex relationships between concepts but also sparks creativity by revealing unexpected connections, similar to how mind mapping enhances creative thinking through visual organization of information.\n\nCustomization for Personal Preferences\n\nAnother area where Obsidian excels is customization. Users have the ability to tailor their workspace according to their personal preferences. This includes choosing themes that align with their aesthetic tastes and implementing plugins that enhance functionality.

      "# [Route Hopping](https://forums.dovetailgames.com/threads/route-hopping.83776/)\nThe idea behind route merging is basically the two routes becoming one. For example if they had \"merged\" Antelope Valley and San Bernardino you could drive from Lancaster to LA then jump on a train to San Bernardino without ever stopping the game.\n\nRoute hopping sounds like its basically a quick way to jump between different routes that happen to share terminals. So you can go to LA Union on Antelope valley, walk to a specific location and press a button which allows you to \"hop\" to LA Union in San Bernardino line, but you are leaving the Antelope valley version of LA Union and spawning into the San Bernardino version of LA Union.\n\nYou can already sort of do that but you'd have to quit the game you're in, go back to the main menu, select the other route and spawn into it. What this is doing is eliminating all those steps to make it a more immersive experience and feel like you're continuing a long journey but they are still two separate distinct routes.\n\nI can’t express how excited I am for this one feature alone. The ability to seamlessly load into route from another route feels me with joy, like an 8 year child unwrapping his presents on Christmas morning.\n\nIt makes me wonder now if we’ll get fully completed routes like the ECML and the newest member, the WCML.\n\nMentioning this now for the 200th time lol, e.g. King’s Cross to Peterborough (please make this route DTG) *prays to the DTG elders*. Then seamlessly load up at the same station (Peterborough) and carry on to Doncaster.\n\nI’ve seen some complaints about the Avanti on the new WCML only clocking in at 50 miles, while it’s not ideal for a sprinter train at least the option is there for DTG or a third party to extend the WCML in the future. Even legacy routes such as BML route hopping onto ECW etc. The potential is endless. I can not wait to see how this feature evolves in the future, maybe eventually leading into route merging like in TSC. I won’t run before I can walk though. Thank you for listening DTG <3 Cheers.\n\nYes, that’s some really good points I didn’t think of. Until we can fully test it for ourself’s there’s no way of knowing how much fine tuning DTG did on this new feature.\n\nI’m looking forward to the preview streams, hopefully they can shed some light on this.\n\nLeaning towards \"no\" for both simply because that involves programming the two routes to \"synch\" when they're not made for it. Could be wrong though. To me it's not a helluva lot of difference and not matching the current weather is the price to pay to get this feature, I'll take it.\n\nI could be wrong though. They could have done the extra step to \"integrate\" the two routes.\n\nI'd guess it's more like \"journey mode\" where you just go from one \"mission\" to the next. That would be the easiest to integrate with the least amount of programming. I'm going to make sure this works first before asking for MORE features on something that's not even released yet though =-)\n\nI did notice that there's even multiple \"hops\" available... for example per the FAQ you can drive from one end of the Antelope map, to the San Bernadino map, to end on the Cajon Pass map. That's a HUGE improvement and should scratch that itch for the \"we need longer routes\" folks. That run would be a 220 mile run all at once.\n\nDriving the SEHS then all the way down the GWE would be pretty neat too, or London to Eastbourne on the ECW. Connecting the whole route from Leven (Fife) to Glasgow would be pretty amazing too.\n\nI don't think you are \"walking\"... I think it just \"loads\" the new route in and you start as if you had \"stopped\" at the station.\n\nIt's a pretty good compromise for me...provided it is available for non-timetable routes too.\n\nFor example say I want to drive the whole Antelope-San Bernadino-Cajon Pass route.\n\nDo I have to stick to JUST what's in the timetable?\n\nWhat if the train I want isn't in that timetable?\n\nCan I create a scenario using the same 3 maps?\n\nCan I \"Free roam\" and spawn my own train to drive across the 3 maps?\n\nThat's my only concern with it....because San Bernadino is not a freight map. Antelope has just 1 real freight (split into 4 services, but it's still the same one repeatedly in the timetable), and Cajon Pass is ONLY freight.\n\nSo... what would you be able to drive between the three different maps in a single go?\n\nWould the Intermodal that starts on Antelope continue on San Bernadino and then end on Cajon Pass?\n\nEven if it is, that's limited to just 2-3 loco types (well one stock, and then two substitutions possible)\n\nIf I want to create my own train/consist to drive between the three maps, can I do so?\n\nThe thing is, nothing runs directly on all three routes.\n\nAntelope Valley is Metrolink owned with Union Pacific Freight\n\nSan Bernardino Line is Metronlink for the full length, with local UP and BNSF traffic in various areas\n\nCajon Pass is mainly BNSF\n\nThere is no real train that runs across all 3 routes in a direct path, so it's really just a player swapping trains to different routes that are \"technically\" connected to each other\n\nWell something must connect because they're listed as able to be \"route hopped\" in the FAQ.\n\nEven if it's a bit of 'creative interpretation of reality.\"\n\nI'm not sure the Antelope freight is \"real\" (feels like they added it on later as a layer) so they'd probably just extend that. through all 3 maps as a proof of concept. Although, I could see them adding a Metrolink layer that doesn't exist too for the passenger folks.\n\nThere ARE passenger routes from AMTRAK down Cajon Pass in real life but they wouldn't be run by Metrolink....\n\nIf you are just standing around like in Free Roam between timetable runs... how is \"route hopping\" different from just loading the new route into Free Roam? What added advantage does \"route hopping\" give we didn't already have?\n\nIs it just a \"route planner\" so you know what timetables are \"roughly\" at the same time?\n\nWhat if it's a through service in real life where you don't get off the train? Are you still spawning on the platform anyway and have to get back into the train like \"going to take a bathroom break?\"\n\nI was really hoping you'd spawn in a train matching the one you were in on the previous route and just start from the station...not wait around for 15 minutes on the platform.\n\nYes ECML with TSW4 was very uninspiring re. it's lack of terminus and length. If the free upgrade had been available back then I would have honestly passed on it and waited for a big sale. I urge DTG to revisit this route and add a paid dlc that extends it to London, if necessary by using this new feature. Then we will have the perfect run for when a 91 is finally added, plus another line for 700 traffic. In actual fact this would make a great core route for TSW6 if they cannot do it before.\n\nAs has been mentioned before, unless the work was previously done in an original release of a route to allow for the possibility of an extension, then the routes would essentially need to be rebuilt from ground up, before then also working on the extended section. The original SEHS ram between St Pancras and Faversham, and that had to be rebuilt again before they could add the Ashford and Dartford extensions in SEHS2.\n\nGiven the time this must take, I can’t really see DTG justifying committing spending so much time essentially rebuilding an existing route when they could be working on brand new content.\n\nIt’s a shame - I really would like to see DTG expand current routes rather than splitting them into multiple separate routes - For example if we got another WCML in the future north from MKC to Birmingham or further, but I honestly can’t see it happening unless there is a very special reason to warrant it\n\nI thought Matt's reply on this was very measured in the stream.\n\nIts obviously something they would like to do, but the way the routes are built (everything from scenery to timetables) is not standardised. I hadn't even considered the complexities of timetables previously.\n\nWhat I think many would like some view on, is that there is a plan to avoid future technical debt, and where there are route crossovers, considerations are made around timetables, scenery etc that would facilitate an evolution towards route merging in the future without a complete re-write.\n\nFor example, where a route gets too complex to extend in a conventional manner (WCML?) I'd propose it could be split up into logical packaged 'products' and released separately. If provisions are made to harmonise the sceneries and timetables, i can't see any showstopping technical reason why a player controller service couldn't be migrated from one route to another in an acceptable manner.\n\nWhy should they do it?\n\nWell, forgetting the obvious enthusiasm community wide for this - On the business side it really does make a lot of sense:\n\n1. Shorter development cycles with more regular route updates and more transparency for the community with regards to direction of travel (see what I did there?)\n\n2. Less risky big route projects - WCML must have taken a LOT of investment. Ironically, the sections north of Milton Keynes would be a lot easier to develop, but would have less demand (see criticism of ECML) without the route to London. Developing even a short addition to WCML including in-train Route Hopping would generate significant interest and revenue, from a relatively cheap endeavour. They have done the hard work already!\n\n3. Less reliance on Rolling Stock for perceived value - Intrinsic value becomes the growing route, rather than relying on new trains. This again would simplify the development process and probably open up more avenues with third parties to add niche extensions.\n\nHow should they do it:\n\n1. Identify a candidate route for a proof of concept (community led?).\n\n2. Agree route extension direction - This should deliberately be a extension in the region of 15-20 mins driving time, which doesn't offer any new significant services or rolling stock, but may extend some by a few stations for example. The purpose here is to prove that a short development cycle using route hopping to piggy back on another route can be profitable and well received, even if its to nowhere special.\n\n3. Develop the route using the existing scenery for any duplicated locations.\n\n4. Develop the timetable leveraging the existing route timetable as a baseline. Include margin of approx 5% for delays with route hopping unable if delayed more than that.\n\n5. Develop the route hopping functionality so that player trains (only) that transverse both routes have the option to switch from one route to the other in-cab. This isn't difficult - its a a read and lift of the train config and a load of the new route with that same config, just like is done in a scenario.\n\n5. Market the route as it is, a POC to test feedback\n\n6. If successful, extend the second route further in small chunks conventionally (no route hopping) until it also reaches a point of maximum complexity. Start process again....\n\nDo it quickly. Fail or Win fast - It could revolutionise the sim.",
      "# [Assetto Corsa EVO’s “Eifel” Open-World Map Revealed, Will Expand to Over 600 Square Miles by Him ScaffUK on 2024-12-11](https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/assetto-corsa-evo%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Ceifel%E2%80%9D-open-world-map-revealed-will-expand-to-over-600-square-miles.429802/page-2)\nAs long as they don't stray too far away from their circuit focus, I'm for it. It's funny to see all of the things I was asking for when playing Forza Motorsport 2 and 3 coming to racing games nowadays.\n\nI am wondering about what specs will be required to run the game. Hopefully the optimization comes along.\n\nLikewise with me, ACE is seemingly going to be doing what I’ve wanted GT to do for 8-14 years now.\n\nAuthentic and realistic physics with competitive AI, some garage management, and some quirky scenarios to navigate via an economy and maybe XP system. Doesn’t have to be too complex, but ultimately allows engaging and educational automotive for both experienced and new players.\n\nSo let modders do that kind of stuff. Again, I think it is a waiste of Time and ressources.\n\nIf something open worldish should be attempted, it's the route of Mille Miglia and not the Eifel région. But hey, that's personal opinion and I know I am a minority hère 🤣\n\nI have similar thoughts. Why not use the lidar-based fast modelling tech Kunos has to give players access to closed-road versions of famous roads (like the Grossglockner Hochalpenstrasse or Hakone Turnpike for example), bring to life large circuits of the past (like the Piccolo Madonie), or flooding players with several hillclimbs and street circuits? Locations that could be used for competitive driving and racing events, not just delivering tiramisu or getting stuck in traffic. I guess we'll see how the open world will be utilized, I hope it's not just a gimmick that uses a sizable share of the game's resources and that the game will still have a large focus on closed-course competitive driving and racing.\n\nSo that's about 39.4 x 39.4 km^2, very impressive. I wonder how many more of these free-roaming maps they plan to add, because it sure takes a lot of time and money to make at this quality!\n\nI don't know what kind of back and forth unit conversion is going on here, but I'd go as far and say that 1600 km² is even 40km x 40 km\n\nAnd tbh I don't see them add another free roam map in the near future. Sounds like this one will keep them occupied for years.\n\nI really just don't care about the open world stuff. It's bloody tiring that everything needs to have open world these days. As long as Kunos delivers on the track and cars departement I'll stop complaining but I find it a huge waiste of resources\n\nThe difference for me is that it’s a simulation instead of arcadey physics, it could give a whole different feeling driving these cars around the country roads (and hopefully also villages) of the Eifel. Don’t know if you ever been there in real life, but I can tell it’s really nice around there.\n\nA open area like this in a simulation like this, would be a Premier in video games as far as I know.\n\nBut sure, it also depends on the activities they implement in this open world.\n\nI wished this stuff. A grown man wishing this stuff for yearrrrrrrrrrs.\n\nWanting to drive around and stop at buildings in Gran Turismo. However, other than GTA, Forza Horizon was close to that. Drive around and drive to towns and drive to circuits. It would be incredible to leave from a garage. Take a brisk drive on some curves. Go to some speed shops and then, drive to the Nordschleife. Do a lap and then, drive “home”.\n\nLikewise with me, ACE is seemingly going to be doing what I’ve wanted GT to do for 8-14 years now.\n\nAuthentic and realistic physics with competitive AI, some garage management, and some quirky scenarios to navigate via an economy and maybe XP system. Doesn’t have to be too complex, but ultimately allows engaging and educational automotive for both experienced and new players.\n\nAnother grown man who has wished for this half his life here, I just hope they manage to bring the magic, devs these days tends to promise a lot and get us hyped, then does the opposite. Recent memory refresher: TDU:SC.\n\nBut seriously. Everything they’ve said about this game is everything I wanted for GT. A way to manage the duplicates with a \"spec selector\" or what you want to call it, an open world you can interact with, a place to chill between races.\n\nI have similar thoughts. Why not use the lidar-based fast modelling tech Kunos has to give players access to closed-road versions of famous roads (like the Grossglockner Hochalpenstrasse or Hakone Turnpike for example), bring to life large circuits of the past (like the Piccolo Madonie), or flooding players with several hillclimbs and street circuits? Locations that could be used for competitive driving and racing events, not just delivering tiramisu or getting stuck in traffic. I guess we'll see how the open world will be utilized, I hope it's not just a gimmick that uses a sizable share of the game's resources and that the game will still have a large focus on closed-course competitive driving and racing.\n\nI utilize LiDAR often enough with my iPhone, have for years. Pay me well enough and I’ll scan whatever you want and give you the data to use in whatever game engine you want.\n\nSo let modders do that kind of stuff. Again, I think it is a waiste of Time and ressources.\n\nIf something open worldish should be attempted, it's the route of Mille Miglia and not the Eifel région. But hey, that's personal opinion and I know I am a minority hère 🤣\n\nWe all have our opinions, but if it was a mod it would proably not be laserscanned to be 100% accurate, and its great to have something more to it in ac evo, than just rely on mods thst we had to with ac1, and quality comtrol was just not there, many of the maps looked quite bad, and none had any interactions with the buisnesses in open world.\n\nConsole players could even take part of this as well.\n\nIf we have a world that large, we will obviously need some things to do there. Now I was a little worried about what Misha said about the tiramisu delivery thing as it sounded pretty scripted. a bit like the little stories in FH5. I truly hope they will offer a range of things to do leaving enough freedom for the player to play as they like and also get gameplay elements out there that are linked to actual freeroam. I am hopeful because of what Marco said about the fact that some days we don't feel like continuously trying to shave another 2 tenths off a lap time but instead we just want a quick and more relaxing 20 minutes of driving. I truly hope that means there will be reasons enough to use the map apart from simply exploring.",
