The company is inspired by successful platforms like Epic Games and Roblox, focusing on integrating user-generated content with major brands and creators [(Crunchbase, 2024)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/roam-3fbc).\n\nRoam's primary product is its game-making platform, which enables users to generate personalized game worlds based on their descriptions of daytime, environment, layout, and special assets.

      "# Post ID oszpl5: Any game similar to rdr2 single player free roam? with +37 score by [(Monsieurabsurd, Reddit, 2021-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/)\nhttps://www.gamesradar.com/amp/the-joy-of-not-really-doing-much-of-anything-in-red-dead-redemption-2/\n\nThis article pretty much sums it up. I beat the game a while ago and enjoy just free roaming around the map with no objective, just wondering around, discovering things, places, people, random events. Sometimes hunting and fishing, etc... Is there any game out for the ps4 that is similar to this type of game play experience? Doesn't even need to be western themed.\n\n## Comment ID h6t4cm7 with +15 score by [(Queeflet, Reddit, 2021-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/h6t4cm7/) (in reply to ID oszpl5):\nNo other game does this as well as rdr2, I’ve played almost all of the big popular open world games on PS4 and all of them feel dead and sterile compared.\n\n### Comment ID h6x5cgf with +3 score by [(Ace_OPB, Reddit, 2021-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/h6x5cgf/) (in reply to ID h6t4cm7):\nAgreed.

I haven't found anything quite as good as RDR2 for immersive free roaming. Titles I have enjoyed in no particular order are:\n\nWitcher 3: a little less focused on interactive free roam world but definitely lots to explore.\n\nGhost of Tsushima: again less interactive free roam but a fantastic experience (I actually preferred it over RDR2).\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn: definitely a fun game to go exploring in. I loved this despite it being a setting I traditionally don't enjoy.\n\nFar Cry 5: first person shooter with an interesting world to explore. It has many flaws, imo, but can be fun to wander about. The fishing is, imo, better than RDR2.\n\nGhost Recon Wildlands: suggesting this over the newer Breakpoint as it has a better world with the possibility of creating more intense situations.\n\nWatch Dogs 2: all three games are on ps4 but 2 in my opinion has the best map for exploration and the most potential to create interesting situations.\n\n## Comment ID h6s73ef with +12 score by [(DarkIxis, Reddit, 2021-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/oszpl5/any_game_similar_to_rdr2_single_player_free_roam/h6s73ef/) (in reply to ID oszpl5):\nDays Gone is the sandbox I'm trudging through, good mechanics, decent story, and lots of exploring.

You appreciate the wildlife, the trees, the weather, the landscape and the music a lot more when you're not blazing past it at 100mph. \n\nBut that's the downside: most game companies are about providing intense action at all times. Very few games want to give the player a slow moment because those are moments that a player is likely to stop playing in. Even comparing RDR1 to RDR2 illustrates this as RDR1, fantastic as it is, plays more like a _video game_ than a _simulation_, which is the core difference in my eyes\n\n### Comment ID gsbh2i9 with +9 score by [(LexB777, Reddit, 2021-03-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbh2i9/) (in reply to ID gsb7qjk):\nReally interesting point. I had considered the slow pacing, but not the fact that you actually move and do things slower.\n\nWhen I first started the game, I found the pacing made me antsy. I kept wanting to go faster, but I *knew* that I would fall in love with this game. I played the ever living shit out of RDR1, over and over again. Same with GTA5 and Skyrim. I'm the kind of player that buys about 1 or 2 games per year.\n\nNow that I'm in the last Chapter of the whole game, I wish I had taken it even slower (even though I have 180 hours logged into the first save, not sure if that's normal but it feels like a lot). I definitely will go even slower on my second play through.\n\n#### Comment ID gsbhj5p with +4 score by [(Joss_Card, Reddit, 2021-03-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption2/comments/mdmqjh/what_other_free_roam_games_compare_to_the/gsbhj5p/) (in reply to ID gsbh2i9):\nThat's what I did. I spent as much time in chapter 2 as I could, doing as much as I could before I had to move the camp.

That's the jg.\n\nJg is basically roam+. You do what roam does and then some extra. On one hand, you're probably going to be using heroes that have some of the most obnoxious power spikes and playmaking potential, on top of two buffs and a fast level 4. On the other hand, that means the team has *you* to look to to find the straws that will break the camel's back, and turn the tides of an even or even a losing game.\n\nThe stakes are higher, too. If the roam is sent to base multiple times or has some bad sets/kill secures, it's fine, they have utility that is nonreliant on maintaining a lead and can always play from behind, leaving the teammates to pull off the heavylifting of damage and objective secure. As jg, *you are the damage and objective secure*. If you go down, if you can't find a way to outplay your enemy or lose your lead, your entire team is probably doomed.\n\n## Comment ID lnugpd7 with +7 score by [(Maximum-Shrimping, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnugpd7/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nA good roam makes jungling easier. \nA good jungle makes winning the game easier. \n\nThey coexist.\n\n### Comment ID lnugukq with +1 score by [(NoobzProXD, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnugukq/) (in reply to ID lnugpd7):\nThis one seems to be the most reasonable, mlbb is a coop game after all\n\n#### Comment ID lnuhnos with +5 score by [(Maximum-Shrimping, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuhnos/) (in reply to ID lnugukq):\nI have 1 thing to add. \n\nPeople that think roamer is easy are also the same one that thinks that roamer should babysit gold lane.\n\n### Comment ID lnuipzs with +1 score by [(Arata_9, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuipzs/) (in reply to ID lnugpd7):\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o180is0uwopd1.jpeg?width=449&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=279ade612825bc2c8c3b510b8ac522207084671b\n\n## Comment ID lnu8o1l with +12 score by [(Arata_9, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnu8o1l/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nYes it is.\n\nCome on all roles are important but the fact that a Jungler can guarantee you a lord and turtles is what it makes challenging and important \n\nAnd yes Roaming IS the easiest role for me\n\nYou can say roamers die protecting their teammates, but that is uncommon, mostly after a gank or set roamers survive, with low health but they do\n\nRoamer is least likely to be killed \n\nSurvival is the easy part\n\nBut to use their skills to set up cc and change the game is really difficult\n\n### Comment ID lnuaewf with +5 score by [(MiloCAD, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuaewf/) (in reply to ID lnu8o1l):\nYes, perhaps roamer is easier, but finding a decent roamer is like finding a needle in a haystack.\n\n#### Comment ID lnuakg1 with +2 score by [(Arata_9, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuakg1/) (in reply to ID lnuaewf):\nOf course\n\n### Comment ID lnuhwl3 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuhwl3/) (in reply to ID lnu8o1l):\nhaha, by reading this I know you don't roam that often.\n\n### Comment ID lnuynfk with +1 score by [(Rgamingchill, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuynfk/) (in reply to ID lnu8o1l):\nI'm both a good Jungler and a good roamer.

If the mm hiding behind the tank is pierced through the tank, it's the tank's fault. If your Jungler is bonkers in the head you have to do his part of ganking too. \n\nOn the other side, junglers can hide under the excuse they were farming or that the ganking of a lane isn't I  their rotation. If the roamer babysits a lane, it's a Jungler's job to gank the other.

Imo, yes for most matches in normal ranked games, junglers need to manage farming, ganking, dictation of teamfights and securing neutral objectives, all the while dealing with random variables like whether the mage and roam is on point and helping to defend against jungle invasions/providing vision etc, and also needing to read the flow of your laners, to provide extra assistance and attention if your laners are particularly weak to their counterparts either by drafting compatibility or skill gap.\n\nRoamers on the other hand, simply need to provide vision, stuns and/or support, defend against or support jungle invasions, and frontlining in teamfights but majority of roam players cant do that even decently, while always looking to blame someone for problems of their own making (usual targets for verbal abuse being MM and Jungler). Proper roamers also do not need to farm, so that takes a load of pressure off their shoulders (not considering assassins mainly as assassin roamers are pretty gimmicky, and usually work out lesser the higher the elo, not to mention that it usually attracts players with terrible roamer competencies even if they are good at the hero). Also roam hero mechanics are amongst the easiest while jungler heroes tend to be more dificult relatively on average, so its pretty difficult to argue in any dimension that roaming is harder than jungling in usual circumstances.\n\nHowever, thats a little different in the pro scene, because most pro players are near the very limits of their effective capacity and rarely makes any fundamental mistakes in their roles. Rather teamfights are the nexus event that determines whether the game is won or lost, and roamers have a outsized role when it comes to teamfight initialisation, frontlining or disrupting the enemy's flow by clouding their judgement and forcing them to use skills at the wrong time. Kills are also rarely secured 1v1 in that level due to the high competency of everyone on that level, which means any kill from another person at least involves the mage or jungler, but probably the roamer, so roamers play incredibly important roles in the pro scene, serving as the difference makers.

You're juggling multiple responsibilities and there's a lot of pressure on you. \n\nRoam is one of the hardest to carry a game with, meaning it's harder to rank up even if you are a good roam, which is why some people say it's the \"hardest role\" even when I would say it's simple to learn and pick up.\n\n The hardest thing to learn about it is predicting enemy movement, but that comes with time lol, unlike jungling where you have to be dedicated to having quick jungle retri, fast fingers for certain skill casting, and good timing etc.\n\n### Comment ID lnuxobw with +1 score by [(Arata_9, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnuxobw/) (in reply to ID lnutz5l):\nHeckincat Spitting fax cat\n\n## Comment ID lnv050a with +1 score by [(Rgamingchill, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnv050a/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nFor a game to go well, Roamer and Jungler both need to be in sync. \n\nJunglers are what can make or break a game, one mistake and you may never get a kill in the game again.\n\nThe roamer however, can cost the game even more than a Jungler. A good Jungler with a bad roamer can't win a game by themselves against half-decent players. I've seen that firsthand in my games, either me or a team mate was Jungling and the roamer was awful, or in the enemy team where they had a great jungler and a God awful roamer. The jungler has higher expectations on their shoulders, but they need a roamer to pull them off. You can steal infinitely many objectives if you are good with retri, a bad roamer will make all of that useless. \n\nFurthermore, if a Jungler is bad, what they fail to do falls on the roamer. If a jungler wastes Retribution, it's the roamer who is expected to delay or halt the enemy team from taking the objectives while the cooldown is on. A roamer can often salvage something from a Jungler's mistake, which isn't true the other way around. \n\nLet me put it this way. Roaming is easy to learn, hard to master, while Jungling is hard to learn, but easy to master. As such, In the middle Point of the learning curve, Roaming definitely feels(and is) harder. That is, of course, not the case if the roamer in question is not a setter tank.\n\n## Comment ID lnv0sdv with +1 score by [(TerracottaaBanana, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnv0sdv/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nNeither they both are equally hard the roamer have the utility to be useful in the game no matter what stage they are in and jungler have DPS  to be useful in the game no matter what stage but they gotta to see care of objectives while roamer take care of other imo they both basically support each other as a role (I play both roam and jungle) I always ask for my roam to babysit me or I babysit my jungler until 5 minute and feed him roamer and jungle are the same role with different objective if you really think about it too they both roam they both support teammate while jungle put Damage on the table, Tank put utility so they are equally hard but if I have to choose I would say roam because they can't solo carry like jungle\n\n## Comment ID lnv3cjw with +1 score by [(LandscapeFeisty951, Reddit, 2024-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileLegendsGame/comments/1fkaela/is_jungler_harder_than_roam_image_non_related/lnv3cjw/) (in reply to ID 1fkaela):\nAs a roamer I think jungler is harder.

Multiplayer wasn't internet, unfortunately, and I think the game might have been old enough to have IPX as an option lol.\n\nAbsolutely my favorite campaign mode of any jet sim ever, unmatched to this day. \n\nInterestingly, the whole premise of the sim was that you could fly either the X32 or X35 (yes, this sim came out *before Lockheed won the contract* ) to compare the two, theoretically. Neither of the VTOL variants made an appearence, and the X35 did not have the modern big screen instrument panel it has today.\n\nAlso, after ejecting you could walk around and shoot things with a handgun that was terrible to aim lol.

Actually this experience would be a lot better at night but you have to worry about the cops. But Palm City is an awesome map with a Miami aesthetic and it carries the atmosphere hard. The driving is also decent and the roads are really good.\n\nIf you like piss filters, Most wanted 05 is actually not a bad game for free roam, Rockport is a surprising great map with varied locations, great roads and a great driving model, but not at slow speeds relative to your car. If you want to just fly through through the city to keep adrenaline going, Most Wanted for you. \n\nI think the best free roam game might be Carbon. Palmont is not that big, especially compared to the later games. But goddamn is the free roam experience so good. The atmosphere is amazing, great roads and the city is pretty good, it has really cool locations that great to cruise and explore in. Only problem is that it may feel kinda small. Plus it's got a banging soundtrack and the driving is also great, albeit sense of speed's not as good as MW 05 but still good. And sometimes there are cars that would just pull up on you and want to race you. You do have to be wary of cops though, but you can avoid, and you pay to lower your heat later at the safe house. And if you do get into a chase, it will be a good one imo.\n\n## Comment ID kre54pz with +1 score by [(Saiibox, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/1avkd0v/best_nfs_game_to_free_roam/kre54pz/) (in reply to ID 1avkd0v):\n2012 easy no contest\n\n## Comment ID krfddry with +1 score by [(JS-CroftLover, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/1avkd0v/best_nfs_game_to_free_roam/krfddry/) (in reply to ID 1avkd0v):\nNeed For Speed Most Wanted 2005\n\n### Comment ID krvw9e0 with +2 score by [(dark_fesse, Reddit, 2024-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/1avkd0v/best_nfs_game_to_free_roam/krvw9e0/) (in reply to ID krfddry):\nmain issue with mw05 free roaming is that a single accident (hitting anything on the map) will pretty often result with the cops being called and coming to find you\n\n#### Comment ID kryjsfs with +2 score by [(JS-CroftLover, Reddit, 2024-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/1avkd0v/best_nfs_game_to_free_roam/kryjsfs/) (in reply to ID krvw9e0):\nThat's why I always drove the cars responsibly, around Rockport 😃\n\n## Comment ID krjo5dv with +1 score by [(xkhloerodimusx, Reddit, 2024-02-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/1avkd0v/best_nfs_game_to_free_roam/krjo5dv/) (in reply to ID 1avkd0v):\nMw2012\n\n## Comment ID ksmdh1u with +1 score by [(codycbradio, Reddit, 2024-02-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/needforspeed/comments/1avkd0v/best_nfs_game_to_free_roam/ksmdh1u/) (in reply to ID 1avkd0v):\nUnderground 2 for the free roam without cops.

It’s gotten a lot of hate. It’s just as fun as the first two. It’s a super cop game where you can jump real high, blow shit up, throw cars and objects and people around, wing suit every where, drive suped up cars and do crazy jumps and all that shit. \n\nThe great thing is, if you don’t want to play the game for him and beat it, there’s a mode called “Keys To The City” or something along those lines. \n\nBasically it’s a mode where you can spawn in any object from the game, like deck him out with all weapons; you can max level the character instantly so he has the highest jumps and is the strongest. Spawn any vehicle, enemies, bosses (I think bosses not sure). Basically just a big ass chest playground. Enable god mode, enable a jet pack, bunch of more of the wacky weapons. Super super flexible and when you start it everything from the main game is completable here. You can go through the whole game with god mode enabled, best weapons, find all the power ups, and all that. \n\nIt’s gunplay is lock on based so he doesn’t need to be super accurate. \n\nI would say if he likes open world, this is the game to choose. Let’s him go through the story basically in easy mode if he wants, and just go around knocking off objectives or fucking around too.\n\n## Comment ID jvckape with +1 score by [(VQ_Sal, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvckape/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nRed Dead redemption 2, if he wants to be a cowboy\n\n## Comment ID jvckczl with +1 score by [(lordnyrox, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvckczl/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nRDR2\n\n## Comment ID jvckkd1 with +1 score by [(SpicyNoodlez1, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvckkd1/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nThere's alot of better games then gta that's like it, cyberpunk, red dead 2\n\n## Comment ID jvcklfk with +1 score by [(TheLewisIs_REAL, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvcklfk/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nNever played cyberpunk but from clips it gives me GTA vibes so maybee that\n\n## Comment ID jvcoofk with +1 score by [(Pvzlife, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvcoofk/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nMaybe something like fallout or Skyrim?\n\n## Comment ID jvcpegt with +1 score by [(UltraToaster, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvcpegt/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nA little older now but Prototype 1 and 2 are both games that you can just roam for hours being an unbeatable god doing whatever you want, especially if you've finished the campaign and want to let him roam around.\n\n## Comment ID jvcu8bn with +1 score by [(NomadSoul22, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvcu8bn/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nKatamari is not like those games but i think that could work\n\n## Comment ID jvcxpk3 with +1 score by [(Kell-ah, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvcxpk3/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nJust Die Already is a good one\n\n## Comment ID jvd0ps8 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvd0ps8/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nPressure washer simulator\n\n## Comment ID jvd2ji8 with +1 score by [(PoshEwok, Reddit, 2023-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvd2ji8/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nWatch dogs 2?

At any time you could hand over the controller to him so he can fly the plane.\n\nThe other suggestion:\n\nThe **Forza Horizon** series:\n\nThe difficulty can be greatly reduced by automating various parts of the driving (automatic gears, ABS brakes, computer controlled per wheel lock, full drive paths, etc. etc.) and lowering the difficulty of computer controlled opponents. I’m (un-)sure there are ways to reduce the difficulty of steering, turning left and right, braking, following the drive path, etc.\n\nCars can be painted in custom colors and fitted with *really* cool looking custom liveries. Among many, many other features.\n\n## Comment ID jvdsgn2 with +1 score by [(Splatulated, Reddit, 2023-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvdsgn2/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\ntheres soem really old title for xbo original called mercenaries playground of destruction\n\n## Comment ID jvdt4uk with +1 score by [(Liquidety, Reddit, 2023-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvdt4uk/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nWatch Dogs can be good just for fucking around on, but the hacks rely on reading so, like, idk. Legion however has some brilliant accessibility features, so it's definitely worth a look. WD1 has less of a fuck aroundability compared to 2 or Legion, but it's good none the less\n\nI also find modded fallout 4 with a few mods to remove maybe the main quests or give you an alternate start a really good screw around game. Obviously it's an FPS but there is a third person mode. Throw a few fucky mods in there and you could make a really fun game just for running around, killing people and looting their bodies, and exploring. Skyrim is the same story really, but the fantasy aspect makes it more reliant on books and text rather than fallout 4 holotapes for a lot of the environmental narrative.\n\nActually, Fallout 76 might be really good. The game has a really accepting, kind community, a completely ignorable main questline and the entire structure is basically jump from event to event to kill things and keep yourself occupied. It's pretty hard resource wise at the start though so that's worth considering.\n\nIdk much about Red Faction because the last time I played it I was like 6, but Red Faction Guerilla is open world and basically just about destroying stuff, with a hammer, because most of the world is destroyable. Might be a good idea, same with the Just Cause franchise. \n\nI'd never normally recommend the Saints Row spinoff Agents Of Mayhem but it's a good third person fuck around game too. \n\nIn a similar vain, Sunset Overdrive. Although, it does somewhat punish you for just fucking around as you will run out of ammo and get swarmed by thousands, and the movement can be really a little complex at times, but it's fun, flashy and has a banging soundtrack. Doesn't take itself seriously at all and it worth a look on YouTube maybe. \n\nYou know what else might be good if you push through the prologue a bit, or even get to the final phase of the game? Red Dead 2, or Red Dead Online. Its really not the worst for just running around and blasting people.\n\n## Comment ID jvdtsb9 with +1 score by [(tirednotepad, Reddit, 2023-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/15lm393/open_world_free_roam_games_like_gta_sleeping_dogs/jvdtsb9/) (in reply to ID 15lm393):\nRead dead redemption 1 & 2, fallout, Witcher, mafia 1,2, & 3, Zelda on switch, Jedi fallen order (you can replay the levels and enemies repopulate after you rest), assasins creed, mass effect.

It’s basically a long spread out movie with incredible story telling that comes largely from cut scenes. I will say, ignore the people who just call it a walking simulator because the “walking” is quite engaging and gets more so the farther you get BUT it is still walking and just observing the landscape and your character Sam. Seeing as you struggled with RDR2 I think you’ll find the high intensity action (meaning shooting and combat) even less prevalent as there is also an emphasis on stealth.\n\n#### Comment ID la1o0dq with +1 score by [(allofdarknessin1, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la1o0dq/) (in reply to ID l9z82t5):\nI wasn't a Kojima fan growing up but I think Death Stranding is a master piece.

Gta driving is mostly physics based and very different than watch dogs.

Love it, but I can not stick to the main storyline lol. Always get wrapped up in side quests or hunting or challenges and always get burnt out - sometimes never even making it past Horseshoe Overlook.\n\nCould try Mad Max. Action gets intense, extremely satisfying hand to hand and vehicular combat. A barren and desolate open world wasteland, but teeming with life still. Only thing is that it's linear. So once you complete quests and events they're pretty much done for good. But still a great experience. Cinematics and story content can be quite appealing too.\n\nFor something simple and a little different, Lego Lord of the Rings. As a big fan of the movies and JRR Tolkien's works in general, I really enjoyed it, from beginning to end! Open world with lots to do in terms of collectivles and interactions, but also level based at it's core. I kept thinking I had finished the game and it just kept surprising me with more content lol. Also couch co-op.\n\nBatman: Arkham City did that too. Very nice amount of content concerning the main campaign and side missions. Lots of cool dialogue as you explore the city that makes it feel more immersive. Just a great game all around imo. Played it 2 or 3 times now. Or Arkham City since it includes the batmobile - which just so happens to have handling just as odd as the vehicle mechanics in Mad Max. But it can be a lot of fun and just as immersive as City imo.\n\nFEZ. Has an interesting way of navigating through the world, similar to Kirby and the Amazing Mirror in it's own right. I thinknof it as a little dopamine generator as the main task is collecting and you get a fun prompt every time you acquire one of the many collectibles placed generously around the game world. Be warned though, the game is finishable without a guide. But if you go for completion, a walkthrough is required. Another one I've returned to several times over the years.\n\nJust Cause 2 or 3? Or Saints Row IV? Vehicle mechanics aren't as finely tuned as they are in GTAV, but great game worlds to explore and follow the main objectives in. Your choice of a tropical paradise or a visually intriguing glitchy neon alien hellscape?\n\n### Comment ID la372jp with +2 score by [(tonguemyanus69420, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la372jp/) (in reply to ID l9yavzh):\nIm the same with Red Dead. 150 hours and only completed 50% of the main story.\n\nIncredible game and world.\n\n### Comment ID la0b4h8 with +1 score by [(Jhoosier, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la0b4h8/) (in reply to ID l9yavzh):\nSaint's Row, can't remember if it's 3 or 4, but it was ridiculously stupid fun driving around and causing mayhem.

It’s an MMORPG like WoW, but (in my opinion) the story is A THOUSAND times better; it’s actually plotted out, so each expansion is a continuation of the overarching story, not just a whole new D&D-style campaign.\n\nPlus the NPCs do eventually have very tongue-in-cheek remarks about “we know you’ve saved the world several times now, but can you spare a few minutes to help with this menial task?” The game doesn’t take itself too seriously (unlike WoW, which I found to be very much all-in on the fantasy RPG and pushing the “you’re the champion of the whole universe” kind of thing) and the developers have been reworking the game so that you can run dungeons (called Duties) with a party of NPCs instead of other players, if solo play is a little more your thing. It’s also useful if you’re trying to level a DPS class, since the queue times can be *painful*…\n\nThere’s a trial version that’s free to play up to Stormblood (the second expansion)/level 70, and if you decide you like it, you can by the complete game for like $60 and it comes with ALL the current content.\n\nTheres a new expansion dropping next week (early access actually opens this Friday) and with it will come a huge graphics update, too. Now would be a great time to give the game a shot!\n\nI also feel it’s a little more casual player friendly than WoW, since you don’t get penalized for not logging in every day (WoW has dailies that can start to feel like you HAVE to do them) and all of the raid content is 100% optional. They don’t lock any major story stuff behind raids, so if you aren’t the type of player to do them, you’ll never miss out on the full main storyline, (unlike WoW lol) but there’s a lot of fun additional lore to benefit from if you DO like doing raids!\n\nETA: It’s also player friendly in that you can learn any and every class on one character, so you’re *never* locked in! If you start with, say, and Archer or a Thaumaturge but decide that you don’t like them/their advanced jobs of Bard and Black Mage, you can just pick up a new class on that same character. It was one of the biggest draws for me when I jumped ship from WoW to FFXIV, and I didn’t even realize how much I hated being locked into one class until I had the option NOT to be lol.\n\nOne of my favorite things to do is to log in and just wander the world. I once put my headphones on, turned my UI off, and made the on-foot trek from Gridania (one of the starting cities) in the Twelveswood to Ul’dah (another starting city) in Thanalan—then turned around and went back the same way. I turned my BGM down so it was quite soft, but had my ambient effects turned up, so I could hear things like the wind in the trees and birds chirping, and by setting myself just to *walk,* with the UI off (and toggling in and out of 1st person POV) I was able to really drink in all the scenery. Which was a really nice change of pace from being knee-deep in the storyline. :) It was one of the most relaxing experiences I’ve ever had, and I highly recommend people give it a try!\n\nYou can get it on PS4/5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Mac, and Steam. If you know anyone who plays, get them to invite you via friend code, so you both get bonuses if you end up buying the game and subscribing for a few months!\n\n#### Comment ID la0bk92 with +1 score by [(Jhoosier, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la0bk92/) (in reply to ID l9z8tpe):\nIf you're considering WoW, I'd throw in a recommendation for Guild Wars 2. The world is massive, there's tons of little one-off stories and things hidden around in addition to the main story. There's also a number of different game styles involved. You can explore and find new/hidden places, the mounts are impressive in their handling. Each one feels distinct and has its own uses.

Ignore literally everything else and just be an oitlaw cowboy doing whatever you want. \n\n Valhalla, I wouldn't consider a game to just wander around in. You can, but i feel its more about the story and seeking gear and mysteries. I disagree with people complaining about Valhalla being too long. It better paces the story than Odyssey does. For me, it perfectly balances the open world RPG style of the recent games with the more focused stories of the older ones, along with having the mystery glitches and rewarding item collection to unlock a piece of gear. \n\nI'm currently playing Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and having a lot of fun. Once you get access to your ikran, it opens up the map and you can easily just explore. It does follow the Far Cry style open world with tons of points of interest to visit and crafting ingredients to collect, but it feels much more organic and engaging.\n\n## Comment ID la3jc8n with +1 score by [(VBTrix, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la3jc8n/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nSea of thieves\n\n## Comment ID la3jloy with +1 score by [(MinuteScientist7254, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la3jloy/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nStarfield\n\n## Comment ID la3x7pv with +1 score by [(kplocdog, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la3x7pv/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nLotro\n\nType it in to Google\n\nWalk around \n\nBe the shire.\n\n## Comment ID la3xoay with +1 score by [(BigOlympic, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la3xoay/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nThe Division\n\n## Comment ID la41zlp with +1 score by [(illmatic2112, Reddit, 2024-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/la41zlp/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nIt's not super deep but during AC2 when i was done and just going around hunting down flags while listening to my music, it was a nice relaxing feeling.

Minecraft has a pokemon mod (cobblemon, not the other one) that I spent some time on recently as well and it was cool to put a fresh spin on a game that old.\nAre you open to older games? Do you have a preference on the genre or type of game?\n\nThe Forest and its sequel both have a cool quality of discovery about them, open worlds, crafting, some body horror, and pretty worlds if you enjoy woodsy terrain.\nSkyrim is an obvious choice, especially if you haven't played it with mods.\nIf you haven't played them or if it's been a long time I'd highly recommend going back to any of the Final Fantasty games between like 6-10, Tactics, or other older classics like Chrono Trigger or Legend of Dragoon. You really can't beat the worldbuilding and storytelling of some of those.\n\nIf you're looking for a more bite sized experience that's easier to pick up and put down, maybe try something like Hades, Risk of Rain 2, or Megaloot. I really enjoy games like these as palette cleansers between bigger, more time consuming or mentally engaging games, like appetizers, to shut off the brain and get lost in the \"one more run\" loop, and typically once I'm ready to put it down there's a bigger game calling my name and I'm more mentally ready to engage with it for the long haul too.\n\n## Comment ID lagn5p2 with +1 score by [(ziasaur, Reddit, 2024-06-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/lagn5p2/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nI liked Zelda: breath of the wild because you could sneak up on monster packs and they’d be kinda vibing and goofing off until they noticed you :D\n\n## Comment ID lagvmf6 with +1 score by [(ToastyPillowsack, Reddit, 2024-06-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dmq6h3/looking_for_a_game_where_the_world_is_fun_to_just/lagvmf6/) (in reply to ID 1dmq6h3):\nThe Assassin's Creed games revolving around Ezio (2, Brotherhood, and Revelations) are pretty great imo.

      "# Post ID n98mgh: I made a guide about when to roam and why roaming is important so that you can win more games! with +54 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-05-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/n98mgh/i_made_a_guide_about_when_to_roam_and_why_roaming/)\nWhen I was first learning League, roaming was one of the things that I struggled with the most. It took me forever to learn when I should break away from the lane structure that the game enforces upon everyone and move around the map more freely. In defense of my past self, successful roaming requires quite a bit of planning and nuance, so my goal for this guide is to help explain that nuance in simple terms.\n\nGuide Link: https://dignitas.gg/articles/roam-sweet-roam-an-explanation-of-roaming-in-league-of-legends\n\nIn short, I detail what criteria should be met before you choose to roam (lane states, jungler locations, etc), and what the actual benefits of roaming are for yourself and your team. For anyone actually looking to try out my advice in game, I also go over some different types of roaming (from mid, from support, from top) with example champions so that you can test out the ideas that I put forth in my article.\n\nAnyway, best of luck, and I hope this guide helps you win more games!\n\n## Comment ID gxmfz6x with +6 score by [(mipin5, Reddit, 2021-05-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/n98mgh/i_made_a_guide_about_when_to_roam_and_why_roaming/gxmfz6x/) (in reply to ID n98mgh):\nGreat guide, concise and easy enough to understand.

If I’m pushed in to enemy turret and I see my midlander looking to make a play/has prio oftentimes I’ll coordinate a roam with them. \n\nSometimes I full roam but usually I say “I can ult mid if u want to fight” and walk up halfway to river into ult range and ult them right after your mid engages. Your ult is so good in this situation because it’s unavoidable and if the 1v1 is even it will let you midlander win every-time with the bonus 300-400 dmg. Free assist everytime and your midlander gets ahead. \n\nOf course if your mid is behind this won’t help much and a full roam with support might be needed but that’s more rare imo.\n\nEdit: also since you’re only roaming up halfway you usually lose like 1 minion for it and you’re not putting yourself at risk assuming you have decent warding.\n\n#### Comment ID gxtisfe with +1 score by [(elevensupernova, Reddit, 2021-05-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/n98mgh/i_made_a_guide_about_when_to_roam_and_why_roaming/gxtisfe/) (in reply to ID gxr7vda):\nThank you!

      "# [A Weekend Guide To Scarborough And The Yorkshire Coast Of England — ROAM WHERE by Rachel Boyles on 2023-03-08](https://www.roamwhere.com/blog/a-weekend-in-scarborough-the-yorkshire-coast-of-england)\nWhy Visit Scarborough And The English Coast\n\nFish and chips. Ice cream. 2 penny slots. Coastal hikes. Lighthouses. Just a few of my favorite things every time we go to the seaside.\n\nWhen I told a few friends from London that I was going to Scarborough for the first few days of the New Year they asked why there. The question caught me off guard, but then it reminded me that just because my family is familiar with an area doesn't mean others are. England has 7,000 miles of coastline, so every region in the country will have the seaside town they're closest to or most likely to visit. Scarborough and the surrounding northeast coast is where my husband's family spends most of their seaside time because the area is quaint, nature-filled, and only a few hour’s drive.\n\nIf you're visiting England for a week, it's easy to have a full itinerary, but time by the sea is special and gives you a glimpse into English seaside culture. From super cute, charming towns with fish and chips and antique shops to long swaths of beach and coastline to hike up and down, it would be a miss not to visit. This post specifically focuses on Scarborough and the surrounding Yorkshire area, but don't let that limit you! If you only have a short amount of time, seek out the coast closest to you and use this post for inspiration of things you can do, because many of these activities aren't unique to Scarborough. That said if you fall in love with the views in the photos, and you have the time, Scarborough is one hundred percent worth your time.\n\nWhen To Visit The English Seaside\n\nOf course, summer is the most popular time because you have a chance at warmer temperatures for sunbathing and maybe even a brave chilly swim, but any time of the year can be a good time to visit. Most times we've visited the seaside have been solely chosen because we've visited family. And more often than not, we're visiting for the holidays in the winter, so I've had my fair share of winter seaside days. No matter the weather, whether it's rainy and cold or sunny and breezy, I've enjoyed every visit.\n\nThis most recent seaside escape took us to Scarborough. Every time I visit my husband's family, they always try to take me somewhere new to me but familiar to them. In past visits, we made it to Whitby, Robin Hood's Bay, and Staithes, and somehow I hadn't made my way to Scarborough yet. Since we were looking for a base for a few day’s visit versus just a day trip, it was the perfect option with lots to do. We visited the first few days of the new year with the hopes of \"clearing out the cobwebs\" (as my father-in-law likes to say) with fresh sea air and nature views.\n\nWhat To Do When Visiting Scarborough\n\nExplore The Harbor And Seafront\n\nWe spent most of our time in Scarborough walking along the seafront of the South Harbor. It's the main location for restaurants, games to play, and beach walks. On our first day, we started at the St. Mary's carpark and walked the half-mile path past the Scarborough castle and down to South Beach Bay. You get a good view of the sea and the town while also admiring the castle walls. Once at the Bay, we walked down the boardwalk along the beach and then came back along the other side of the road to look over the shops and restaurants.\n\nWe visited over the winter holidays, and it was a bright sunny day, so the beach was packed with people. We realized we weren't the only ones who thought being by the water would be a great way to start the New Year. Even with the masses, I was still enthralled with it. There is just something so uniquely distinctive about UK seaside culture, and Scarborough has it all. Full families walking along the waterfront together, everyone with either fish and chips or ice cream, bundled up in coats and hats, all in front of a backdrop of bright signs, tourist shops, and the waves crashing in the distance.\n\nOn each of the two nights we stayed in Scarborough, we also came down to walk along the harbor. The harbor front is also home to many 'casinos'(?) with 2p slots (more on that below), so that was also our evening entertainment.\n\nAll of this to say, it's the thing to do in the place. Just go for a walk and observe at the very least.\n\nPlay 2p Slots\n\nI can't write this post without talking about 2p slots. If you're from the UK, you most likely don't need an explanation. But as an American, I find them unique, almost perplexing, but also incredibly fun and addictive. Basically, they have games that cost a 2 penny coin to play. For most machines, as you and others play, the 2p coins pile up in the machine. The goal is to knock a jackpot worth of coins or some small trinket into a hole below so you can collect it. A jackpot worth of coins is what I always dream of, but I'm not sure if anyone has won more than £1 (= 50 x 2p coins) in one go from these games. And the trinkets are usually things like little animal figurines or whatever the new cheap trendy toy is. (This time the toy in fashion was the push pop keychains, but I could imagine a past where Tamagotchis were on offer.)\n\n2p slot 'casinos' offer a lot of fun for £1. You can search for the machine that looks the most primed, try out what you think is the perfect angle that will win them all, and even attempt different techniques like pushing in a lot of coins all at once or doing them one at a time. Each time we would win a trinket, we would comment on how if we bought it ourselves it would be much cheaper than what we spent winning it, but it's the journey, not the destination.\n\nWhat makes these so peculiar to me is that they're basically lightweight gambling. I felt myself thinking if I just play one more pound I'll crack this machine and get a windfall, but as I said, I'm not sure if that ever happens. But that 1% of hope keeps me coming back and trying again. Even worse, the real deal slot machines are just beyond an 18 or older line on the ground. Signaling once you're old enough, you can play for bigger money.\n\nAnyways, they're (or at least can be) cheap fun and signify a day at the seaside. Enjoy yourself but go in with a budget of £5 or so and keep your wits about you.\n\nGet Fish And Chips\n\nWhere To Walk And Hike / What To Do / What To See In The Area Around Scarborough\n\nThis section wasn't easy to title, because visiting the seaside is often a ‘choose your own adventure’. Looking to walk through a quaint coastal village? They have that. What about a rugged coastline with lots of hiking paths? They have that too. Or what about a wooded hike inland? Yup, there's also that. At each of these places, you can take it at your own pace and explore it the way you want to best.\n\nVisit Flamborough Head\n\nI was blown away by this place. I don't know if it was because I had experienced withdrawals from not traveling and exploring somewhere new, or if really it is that impressive, but I thought it was beautiful. Ultimately, I didn't know what to expect, but it's like a smaller version of the White Cliffs of Dover. In other seaside visits, usually, we're in the harbor so I don't see the rugged coastline as much, so I think that's why this surprised me so much.\n\nIt has easy and ample parking up by the lighthouse. From there, you can hike down to the water and walk around the base of the chalk cliffs and along the rocky beach as you explore the cavernous areas. You can also walk along the top of the cliffs and look at the rolling green meadows ahead and the water crashing below. Even better, we came upon a bay full of seals. We were looking down at them from above, but it was fun to stumble upon them. I also JUST read while working on this post that you can spot puffins from mid-May to July. I might have to return just for that!\n\nA quick disclaimer on tide times\n\nWhen visiting the coast, it's important to keep an eye on the tidal schedule, because, in most locations, the beach is completely covered by a few feet of water during high tide.\n\nA tidal win: We visited Flamborough Head at the perfect time because we were able to explore a large part of the beach and even explore more corners of it by walking around rocks. Not even 30 minutes after we were there, the path around the rocks had waves covering the path. And an hour or two later, the beach would not have been accessible.\n\nA tidal loss: We planned to visit Filey on our way back to Scarborough from Flamborough Head. It made sense logistically, but we didn't watch the tidal schedule. We parked where the family normally parks, which gives you a nice walk along the water into town. Well, we walk down to the beach and end up seeing the water coming all of the way into one of the areas that juts out before we get onto the beach. We contemplated and watched others make attempts. A family on their walk back from town filled their boots with water and a woman got muddy climbing up and over. So we decided against it and went the longer route up and around.\n\nFalling Foss / Foss Falls\n\nThis destination takes you inland, so it's a nice contrast to all of the time near the water. Because it's off the beaten path, it's definitely an adventure. We chose it based on a recommendation from my sister-in-law who had hiked it before. When she came the first time, the path she took was challenging, so this time we searched out a slightly easier path. Slightly is the keyword here, but no matter the difficulty level, it made for a fun family bonding experience. Most of us got mud on us some way or another.\n\nWe started the path by looking down at the waterfall from above, and then we took the long path walking away from the falls for quite a while. We started to zig zag our way back and down to the floor of the waterfall. At the point we reached the stream, we could hear the waterfall but we couldn't see it. This is where things got a little confusing. We tried crossing over the stream and then walking along it, but the path took us away from the falls again. So we scrambled our way back down to the stream, off trail, and then had to find an area of stones or a fallen tree to cross back over. All of that to say we had a fantastic time, spent the afternoon out in the forest, and overcame many hurdles we thought would stop us along the way. The falls are beautiful, and I bet it's fun to take a swim when it's warm in the summer.\n\nThese next three destinations I've visited on other trips to the UK, but they're nearby Scarborough and so worth exploring:\n\nRobin Hoods Bay\n\nSpeaking of quaint villages, this is definitely one, if you can't tell by the name. It's built into the fissure of two hills with winding cobble stone alleyways and sandstone houses. It's a fun walk down to the sea and then you can explore along the beach. We went here a few years back, but it was my first time seeing this coast, and this particular area really stuck in my heart and mind.\n\nWhitby\n\nOne of the more famous stops along the coast, Whitby is known for the remains of the once-large Whitby Abbey as well as the home to Bram Stoker while he wrote Dracula. Whitby has a decent size city center with lots of shops and restaurants to explore. It's very picturesque because it's split by the River Esk which flows into the North Sea, and on either side of the bridge you get a great view of the city, full of brick and stone buildings with their red roofs. This is a fantastic place to stop for fish and chips. We usually get ours at Mister Chips by the beach and eat it outside at the gazebo. As a reminder, keep an eye out for seagulls (they will swoop down and take a whole tray of chips from you). My other favorite stop in Whitby is to get a cup of tea from the tea stall. You can get it in a real mug while you observe the city across the water. Super cute and very English.\n\nStaithes\n\nA much smaller village to visit, in my mind I think of it similar to Robin Hood's Bay. When we visited, we walked through town, by the bay, and along the breakwater. It has lovely views of cliffs that create a nice sheltered harbor that contributed to it becoming a village.\n\nWhere To Eat In Scarborough",

      "# [Wvw roaming by Snorkar.9048 on 2024-09-01](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/topic/150936-wvw-roaming/)\nWell, if you wanted argue over this, you could've just responded to us instead of giving us each a confused emoji.\n\nThat all said, I've tried using most weapons in WvW. There's good reasons why I don't use scepter, and why I use sword/dagger. I just didn't want to go into them, but you're leaving us with no choice. The biggest problem with scepter is that it offers nothing to prevent other professions from just chasing you down and clobbering you. It has almost no control. Harbingers will just match your range, willbenders will run you down no matter what mobility skills you use clobber you with little counter-pressure, warriors will leap then CC you to death, rangers will immobilize spam to lock you down and out-range you, engineers can pick either option, etc. and so on. There's a few gimmicky one-shot builds in WvW, but I've found them quite inconsistent considering they peak at 900 range. At that distance, enemies are already attacking you, or they're locking you down with CC.\n\nThe reason I use sword is because of the counter-pressure. It has its own movement skills in fire and air, and it has evades in water/earth, making for a nice toolbox. But sword hits hard, hits in an AoE, and when combined with other options that the professions have it can lay down some serious hurt. I use weaver for things like Lava Skin, Twin Strike, but special mention goes to Pyro Vortex. I've used Vortex to win 1v3 matches, because it upscales and does immense damage on its own. The advantages that sword gives, alongside of weaver's barrier generation, lets me go toe to toe against those dreaded willbenders in WvW, and I frequently outright kill them.\n\nComing to the offhands, the tossup between dagger and focus is really about offense and defense. I chose dagger, because it offers great CC, area control, and more damage. Earthquake and Updraft are excellent CC skills, Ride the Lightning is an excellent mobility skill, ring of fire provides more area control while also putting down convenient blast fields, and Churning Earth/Fire Grab are great for damage. Water having access to Cleansing Wave and Frost Armor isn't too shabby, either. All of that CC also acts as counter-pressure, and in group fights I'll chain them together to \"capture\" an enemy while my allies pummel him. I bring up focus, though, because the greatest weakness of the off-dagger is that it has no projectile management. That can be a big deal while roaming, since Harbingers are still everywhere. Focus has Swirling Winds and Magnetic Wave to stop projectiles, as well as Obsidian Flesh for the rare invuln skill. However, this comes at the cost of having no good skills in fire, no mobility, less area control, and no additional damage.\n\nWell, if you wanted argue over this, you could've just responded to us instead of giving us each a confused emoji.\n\nThat all said, I've tried using most weapons in WvW.

      "# [Coupling As Many Different Locomotives Together](https://forums.dovetailgames.com/threads/coupling-as-many-different-locomotives-together.78233/)\nhappy 2024 TSW family! I hope you all had great holiday vacation. After being hospitalized for the whole month of December I'm happy to announce I am finally back home And catching up with everything related to TSW. I have been playing around with free roam as I really didn't get a chance to check it out or even go into full depth of what you can and cannot do in this new feature. to make a long story short I have spawned in Midland mainline and basically try to couple as many American trains with the same couplers together. I have literally spent days putting together many different combinations At my favorite point/station in Midland Mainline alongside what I thought to be nuclear reactors Or from what I was told to be a gas plant.\n\nthis was very tedious and found myself yard shunting for literally three days straight before burning myself all of the different Consists lol. I had so much fun messing around with this new feature that I had to make a video showing off my Frankenstein consist is what I'm going to call it and also would like to know if anyone else has tried this with UK or German locomotives. Keep in mind most trains as long as they have the same coupler can pair together but in some cases cannot couple or even move once coupled together due to incompatibility. I do not own all of UK's content and the same could be said for some German routes I still need to get Which is why I mainly focused on what I owned most of.\n\nI do want to add that you can couple the class 66 and the class 43 with American consist Due to the fact they share the same knuckle coupler.\n\nhope you guys enjoy the video and if has a UK version or a German version please share video and pictures down below I would like to see as I think it's really cool\n\nback in the day it was coal fired think in more recent they may have switched to gas bio fuels or may still burn some coal ..with all the clean green energy pushed nowadays lot s of coal fired power stations being closed demolished or converted to natural gas bio fuels etc ..in the game when i went back into unloading loop there a big pile of coal ..i wish they would do a cargo pack for services to power station but free roam will let you do that",
      "# [What about an open-world EFT? What is really planned, after all? by brunnodrk on 2024-03-28](https://forum.escapefromtarkov.com/topic/179741-what-about-an-open-world-eft-what-is-really-planned-after-all/)\nWhen I bought the EFT beta in 2017, I used to hear a lot of people talking about EFT in an open world, but today hardly anyone says anything besides speculations.\n\nSome say we won't have an open world in EFT as initially planned, and the final version will be the same as it is today. Others talk about having some kind of \"loading\" for transitioning between maps, which would be equivalent to a different raid in each one. Finally, some speak of a truly open world like DayZ.\n\nAnd thinking about it, the Streets map alone is very heavy. I wonder how having all the maps in an open world would be; it seems quite unthinkable, doesn't it?\n\nSo, what do we officially know today about Tarkov's open world?\n\n2 hours ago, brunnodrk said:\n\nWhen I bought the EFT beta in 2017, I used to hear a lot of people talking about EFT in an open world, but today hardly anyone says anything besides speculations.\n\nOk first to clarify those a bit.\n\nFirst it was suppose to be \"FREE ROAM\" MODE, so it was never intended to replace raid systems.\n\nAccording to some informations from interviews, it was suppose to act as \"1 big raid, without PMC respawns\" At least thats how i understand \"1 big map with 64 players\" but i may be wrong, it was never discussed exactly how it suppose to work.\n\nThen they said that this MODE will be unlocked once we escape from tarkov (finish story)\n\nAnd then, one of last informations was \"Propably instead 1 big map, there are gonna be 2, Streets and all other maps combined, reason is that Streets suppose to be \"as big as all other maps combined\".\n\nHere is post from 2019 where TheWay said it was still in plan\n\n(TheWay was like Main Emissary guy for Europe if i am correct)\n\nAnd i belive that in 2021 @ShiroTenshi did the same. I can't find it, but recently i had a talk with someone and i think i seen such post/comment.\n\nI think it's one of last informations about Free Roam Mode tho or like \"confirmations\" of any kind.\n\n2 hours ago, brunnodrk said:\n\nOthers talk about having some kind of \"loading\" for transitioning between maps, which would be equivalent to a different raid in each one.\n\nYes, at some point Nikita mentioned \"map to map travel\" as idea or place holder (or thats how most of ppl understood him).\n\nSo instead going straight to Labs, you would have to go Hideout -> Streets -> Labs -> Streets -> Hideout\n\nCause you know, not all maps are connected with Hideout and maps overall are connected with other maps.\n\n(fan made, not offical map, just how it \"could\" look like more or less)\n\n2 hours ago, brunnodrk said:\n\nSo, what do we officially know today about Tarkov's open world?\n\nWell, thing is that in 2016-2018 we did belive in such promises, but then with each other map, we (players) seen that such vision is most likely out of reach.\n\nI belive it still MIGHT be plan/idea for Tarkov, but it's not possible to do.\n\nWhy i think so?\n\nWell, imagine having all map combines (beside Streets), having 64 players and like 200 scavs + loot, it would be really bad for your FPS.\n\nOr there is better visualisation. STreets suppose to be \"as big as all other map combined\" so far it's not even near and we achive like 60-90 fps (On good PC) with only 18 players? And like 30 scavs?\n\nWhat i would really love to see, it's HONEST podcasts with Nikita, not those BS which we were getting, where Nikita does not answer 90% of \"good\" questions, just answer to some with \"It's planned\" \"we wanna do this\".\n\nI would love to see WHATS actually planned, a whole list and whats scraped.\n\nCause looking at Old Gameplays/trailers/interviews we have poo ton of content which was shown but it's cut.\n\nexample:\n\n- Customs dorms - Had a light switch (Gameplay trailer from 2016?)\n\n- Streets Primorsky - Had a light switch (One of first Streets Trailer)\n\n- Streets Concordia - Breakable wall (Battle of concorcia trailer?)\n\n- Melle knife kills animation - One of first EFT gameplay trailer\n\n- Grenade explosion effect (Flying debree, doors being opened by explosion) - One of first gameplay trailers\n\n- Lightkeeper announcments - \"FIrst in game TRADER\" meanwhile it's x wipe with him and he still does not sell anything\n\n- BTR on Streets - Having a group of AI riding on it - Streets Expansion trailer\n\n- \"Kolontay guard will have Ballistic shield, most likely either not lootable or that PMC will not be able to leave map with it and they will be in police station\" - Podcast/interview - Not existing in game\n\n- \"Clans will appear with EFT Arena\" - First informations about Arena in 2021 or 2022.\n\nANd way way way way way way more\n\nI just would love to know whats planned for sure and whats removed completly",
      "# [Released - Pokémon Roam on 2024-09-29](https://eeveeexpo.com/threads/8453/)\nHi there, played your game for a few hours and I think it has a very good foundation. I like the large, sprawling routes, the large towns, and the relative autonomy to go where you please. A few suggestions to improve the experience:\n\n1) Speed Up Button - I just used speedhack so it isn't a huge deal for me, but many people will want to see a Speed Up, especially with a large game like this with tons of backtracking.\n\n2) Quest Log - Quest giver indicators would be nice to have, but really a journal that logs everything as you encounter it would be a massive addition here. Like I encountered several people saying things like \"I've never seen a Hoppip before\" which are clear indicators of a quest. Would be nice to have a log of this, the alternative is the player has to keep their own journal as they play, which is annoying. This is exacerbated by how large the world is as well and it will only get worse as you progress I would assume.\n\n3) Day/Night cycle - Having Day/Night encounters and events is fine, but tying it to your PC clock forces you to play at certain times of your day or to mess with your PC clock which can cause bugs and complications of their own. Having a game 24 hr cycle that doesn't tie to real time would be much better given that time seems relevant to the game.\n\nThat's it for now, I will play a few more hours and see if I run into anything else worth mentioning.\n\nAbout​\n\nWelcome to the Jela region, the largest island of an archipelago southwest of Hoenn.\n\nJela is bisected by a volcanic mountain chain that prevents precise navigation at large distances.\n\nOnly professionals are allowed to Fly, Teleport, Dig and the like. Regular everyday trainers have to\n\nrely on their services or their own two feet to explore the vast region.\n\nJela is realized in this game on an unusual scale. While there are cities, they are much more city-sized,\n\nand they are not the only points of civilization across the region. Routes are dotted with small villages,\n\neach with someone in need of assistance and a gate leading to some secret behind the village.\n\nYour adventure in Jela won't follow any one large overarching plot. Rather, you will meet people along the\n\nway that each have their own story to tell, sometimes intersecting in surprising ways. And the people you\n\nmeet on your journey might not be the same people someone else meets on their own journey in Jela.\n\nFeatures​\n\nnearly all battles are double battles\n\npokemon battles drop items used for crafting, this completely replaces the normal economy\n\nregional dex includes selected Pokemon from generations 1-6\n\nnew custom developed battle mechanics like the Frostbite status and Snow weather\n\nmassive routes with myriad paths\n\npokedex tasks to complete to increase shiny encounter rate\n\n5 major NPC side story paths with many more planned\n\ntime of day affects pokemon encounters, trainer battles, and more\n\nin-depth legendary hunting system will test your knowledge of Pokemon and the Jela region\n\ncurrently 2 gyms with around 8-15 hours of play depending on how much exploring and side content you do\n\neventual plans for 8 gyms you can complete in any order\n\nDownload​\n\nv0.3.2 of September 29, 2024\n\nCredits​\n\nMade by Gavin \"mkdir_not_war\"\n\nBig thank you to Jordan & Greg for being awesome playtesters!\n\n=============================\n\n\"Pokémon Essentials\" was created by:\n\nFlameguru\n\nPoccil (Peter O.)\n\nMaruno\n\nWith contributions from:\n\nAvatarMonkeyKirby\n\nMarin\n\nBoushy\n\nMiDas Mike\n\nBrother1440\n\nNear Fantastica\n\nFL.\n\nPinkMan\n\nGenzai Kawakami\n\nPopper\n\nGolisopod User\n\nRataime\n\nhelp-14\n\nSavordez\n\nIceGod64\n\nSoundSpawn\n\nJacob O.

Day/Night cycle is not something I took lightly and if you find a bug caused by it, please let me know. How far did you get? What's your favorite part so far??\n\nThank you for playing! Day/Night cycle is not something I took lightly and if you find a bug caused by it, please let me know. How far did you get? What's your favorite part so far??\n\nNo problem, thanks for sharing your game with us!\n\nNo bugs at all thus far, I am at the first gym so I am not very far yet. My comment on Day/Night was more or less stemming from the potential of messing with your PC clock causing issues and in general not being a huge fan of real time use in games since I for the most part don't get a lot of time (if any) to play during the day, like ever. So unless I do mess with my PC clock, I am just going to get night encounters which is kind of a bummer.\n\nNo problem, thanks for sharing your game with us!\n\nNo bugs at all thus far, I am at the first gym so I am not very far yet.

So unless I do mess with my PC clock, I am just going to get night encounters which is kind of a bummer.\n\nSuper fair, my buddy who playtested has similar circumstances. I don't really want to get too deep into the weeds about design, but I will say that while Merra City does have some stuff (all optional, anything that is required to progress is open while it's required 24/7) that's only open during the day, I plan to have a lot of stuff in future cities that's only open at night! Nightlife, stuff like that. Maybe even some stuff outside cities too, we'll see. It's not a core tenet of the game, but it's something I want to keep, while still acknowledging that not everyone has all times of day regularly available for them to play. I'm hoping it can still be super fun, even if you only ever play after hours.\n\nAll that being said, I will add that I've tested the game on mobile (Android) and it plays pretty well! So if that is a possibility and it interests you, that could be one way you see some of Jela in daylight. Though of course you'd have a different save file on your phone.\n\nReally appreciate the kind words! I'll consider the quest tab idea. As for the main character, since it's a voiceless MC, I hadn't considered making a custom MC a high priority. As for important characters, most of them do have original sprites! Or at least unique sprites that no one else in the game has.\n\nWould love to hear more about your playthrough!\n\nAlso i forget to say. I think you should also use some costom gen 3 tiles set to make the graphic look more new and not just same like gen 3 fire red and leaf green. I hope you don't mind about my suggestion and because this just suggestion don't force yourself to do it if it not go according to your vision.\n\nSo far my playthrough is enjoying running around and checking every npc because there's many of them and i love big area. As for battle the balance go really well\n\nAlso i forget to say. I think you should also use some costom gen 3 tiles set to make the graphic look more new and not just same like gen 3 fire red and leaf green. I hope you don't mind about my suggestion and because this just suggestion don't force yourself to do it if it not go according to your vision.\n\nI will take this as a compliment lol because actually there are quite a few assets that are custom! I just tried really hard to make them blend in with the existing tileset. Sounds like I managed it. To be honest, I'm not an artist by trade, I'm a programmer, so while I can mimic an art style to some degree, making an all new tileset is a bit beyond my skill set.\n\nI did make the skybox/panorama background of Salyu Peak though basically whole cloth, so you can look forward to that!\n\nI will take this as a compliment lol because actually there are quite a few assets that are custom!

It's just suggestion don't need to think much about it and also there some custom free tiles set in pokemon community and here eevee expo if you decide to use more custom tiles set and building\n\nReally enjoyable with how big the map is but it's hampered by few things.\n\nI thing i don't know if been being spoiled by many new fangame or not but i think you using mostly assets of original gen 3 tiles set and building make the game not stand out with other fangame that use gen 3 graphics but custom building design and tiles set maybe you can change the designs of pokemon center and other building in the game and their interior if you not busy, there many free resources gen 3 graphic examples pokemon shattered light creator allow some of their resources being used if people who want to use it contact the creator first.\n\nThe game need original Sprites for mc using red sprite for me make it less adventurous because new region yet original sprite.\n\nSetting for unreal time in game maybe because some people can only play in evenings they will miss the different if they play during morning and noon so yeah i things Setting for unreal time will be good.\n\nI get some fps drop after long time playing if I'm walking in tall grass because of the Pokemon Essentials version 20.1 version bug that not happen in version 21.1 but this technical issue of pokemon essential and not your fault\n\nThis is big project so think you should open recruitment board maybe because i afraid you will get burnout and sick because how nig this projet.\n\nOther than that i stated, i love the double battle because it's more challenging and how big the map to explore. In overall this is decent demo and i hope you don't mind about the review. Ciao see you in next update",

I think you chose to go with something really special this year, and using the Lapis Armor for it specifically makes it all the more impactful.\n\nI think these two (Horizon, Roam) are my favorites though. The brush strokes combined with the bright, vast colors you use in both are so so so striking. Even the simplicity in Roam! It's very real regardless. I've definitely made that map before for other games ^^;\n\nDay 13 - Horizon\n\nDay 14 - roam\n\nWhat actually what is inktober\n\nInktober is an art challenge every year where you follow a theme prompt for every day in October and make something (technically in ink).

      "# [I tried an eSIM on vacation, and I’ll never go back to roaming plans by Bradly Shankar on 2024-05-04](https://mobilesyrup.com/2024/05/04/flighthub-esim-hands-on/)\nAt the end of March, I went on a 10-day trip to Japan. It was my second time in the country after an impeccably timed pre-pandemic outing in February 2020, and I loved getting to take in more of the beautiful landscapes and delicious food.\n\nThis time around, though, my friends and I tried something different. In 2020, we rented a ‘Pocket WiFi’ device from the airport, which meant having to pre-book online, pick it up from the airport and then drop it off. Not a big ordeal by any means, but still a bit of a hassle, especially during lengthy incoming and outgoing travel times.\n\nThis year, however, I opted for an eSIM, and I have to say, as a first-time user, I really dug the whole experience.\n\nAfter covering Flighthub earlier this year, the online travel agency offered us its newly launched Canadian eSIM in partnership with Celitech. Their eSIM offers non-throttled 5G/LTE access in more than 205 countries around the world, including Japan, and since I knew I was going on vacation soon, I eagerly accepted.\n\nOnce I said when I’d be travelling, I was given an 8GB plan that would be valid between March 20th and April 4th, which was actually slightly longer than when I’d be in Japan. (Having that extra cushion was a nice comfort, though, given how unexpected delays happen all the time when travelling.)\n\nAll of this was outlined in an email with a simple four-step process to set up the eSIM on my phone. Graciously, all you have to do is scan the embedded QR code with your phone and then follow the prompts on your device to add the eSIM as a Secondary Line. I did also have difficulties completing the setup in Ontario until I arrived in Japan (I was getting an error message), although FlightHub says you don’t need to be in the destination country to do so. Still, this was far more preferable to trying to navigate Japanese signs to find the Pocket Wi-Fi kiosk at the airport while jet-lagged.\n\nBut the best part, of course, is avoiding steep roaming fees. I’m on Koodo, whose Easy Roam service lets you pay to use your data plan in the U.S. and other countries. Unfortunately, the cost has gone up significantly over the past few years, and it’s now a whopping $16/day to use Easy Roam internationally. That price is comparable to what other Canadian carriers charge for their roaming plans.\n\nOn work trips where I’m only gone for a day or two, that’s more palatable, but there was no way I was doing that for a longer personal trip in Japan. Given that I would have used my data for as many as 11 days (March 22nd to April 1st), that would have cost up to $176 with Easy Roam. It’s worth noting that Koodo caps international Easy Roam prices at $400 (about 25 days) and then customers can keep using it for free after that point. Back when Easy Roam first launched, however, the international cost was $10/day and the cap was $150 per billing cycle.\n\nFlightHub’s eSIM package, by comparison, was $70. While the FlightHub rep said the $32/3GB plan would have been the recommended base for a trip of that length and location, I liked having the extra data for social media posts, Maps and emergencies. (For context, Japan’s taxi system, to which Uber is connected, can be extremely expensive, so having readily available data to help you navigate the country’s intricate transit lines is especially useful.) By the end of my trip, I’d pretty much hit 8GB anyway.\n\nFlightHub typically mentions potential savings of up to 80 percent versus traditional plans with service providers, and the $70 versus $176 certainly lives up to that. Of course, using an eSIM also means you don’t have to burn through your personal data cap, which could, naturally, only lead to further costs either when travelling or even once you return home.\n\nI also found that the connection itself was quite smooth. There were a few brief instances on the bullet train where it dipped, but that could have easily been due to the rural areas we were passing through. Otherwise, the connection remained consistent throughout my entire trip.\n\nAll in all, I was incredibly pleased with the eSIM experience. It should be noted, however, that FlightHub does have one pretty major limitation — you have to have booked your trip with the agency. With flights being so expensive nowadays, you’ll likely look for flights from a variety of sources, so this is a bit inflexible. In my case, I used Air Canada Aeroplan points to cover the flight home. (You can, at least, add on an eSIM both during and after FlightHub’s checkout process.)\n\nOf course, FlightHub is just one eSIM option, and these are all just my first impressions of it. There are many other eSIM alternatives, which you can learn more about in our handy explainer. But if you’re going to book through FlightHub anyway, I would highly recommend going for an eSIM, both for convenience and affordability.",
      "# [Why It’s Time to Move On from Roam Research and Embrace New Tools by judy ann, medium.com on 2024-10-20](https://medium.com/@judyannpperez/why-its-time-to-move-on-from-roam-research-and-embrace-new-tools-ed678d911971)\nRoam Research was once a popular choice for organizing thoughts with features like bi-directional linking and a non-linear approach. However, in the fast-paced world of productivity apps, it can quickly become outdated compared to newer tools designed for modern users.\n\nEffective note-taking tools boost productivity by capturing ideas and organizing information. As demands grow, our tools must evolve to avoid hindering productivity.\n\nIt’s time to explore alternatives that not only match Roam’s capabilities but surpass them in innovation and user experience. Obsidian is popular among the best productivity apps due to its Markdown support and unique bi-directional linking feature. However, we must ask: do these productivity apps outperform Obsidian in note-taking?\n\nReady to change your note-taking habits? Discover new tools offering better functionality and flexibility. Let’s explore what’s next in note-taking.\n\nThe Limitations of Roam Research\n\nRoam Research, once favored for organizing complex thoughts, now faces limitations making it appear outdated.\n\nPerformance Issues: Users report slow performance with large databases, affecting productivity.\n\nLack of Mobile Apps: Without native mobile support, on-the-go access is restricted, hindering modern workflows.\n\nSecurity Concerns: Inadequate data protection and unclear policies raise privacy concerns.\n\nThese challenges prompt users to seek newer solutions that better align with current needs.\n\nWhy Users are Seeking Alternatives\n\nThe digital note-taking landscape is evolving along with user needs. As people seek greater productivity, they’re exploring alternatives to Roam Research. Users now require adaptable features for dynamic work processes.\n\nIntegration is Essential: Modern apps demand seamless integration with task managers, calendars, and communication platforms, creating a cohesive workflow and minimizing app-switching friction.\n\nDemand for Advanced Features: Users call for robust features like enhanced collaboration and AI-powered search. While Roam’s minimalist approach suits some, others desire tools offering flexibility and power for both individual and team environments.\n\nTechnology Supporting Growth: The drive to explore new tools aligns with goals for personal and professional growth. The market offers options meeting these needs, signaling an exciting future for personal knowledge management.\n\nTop Alternatives to Roam Research You Should Consider\n\nNotion: The All-in-One Workspace for Seamless Collaboration and Project Management\n\nNotion is a versatile tool that goes beyond just note-taking. It combines various features to create a comprehensive workspace for both individuals and teams.\n\nHere are some key reasons why Notion stands out:\n\nCustomizable Databases: Notion allows users to create databases tailored to their specific needs. This means you can build your own CRM or track projects with detailed data points that align with your workflow.\n\nTemplates Galore: Notion offers a wide range of templates for different purposes, such as meeting notes or product roadmaps. These templates can be customized to suit your requirements, providing a personalized experience.\n\nWhile some may find the abundance of features overwhelming, others see it as an opportunity to customize their workspace according to their preferences. The balance between complexity and customization is something many users find worthwhile, especially if they’re moving away from Roam Research’s simpler setup.\n\nIn essence, if you’re seeking a tool that can handle both everyday tasks and larger projects — where everything is managed in one place — Notion might be the upgrade you didn’t realize you needed.\n\nObsidian: The Power of Offline Knowledge Management with a Graph-Based Interface\n\nWhen it comes to note-taking and managing knowledge, Obsidian is a strong alternative to Roam Research. What sets Obsidian apart is its graph view feature, which allows users to visually map out their notes and ideas, creating a network of interconnected thoughts. This powerful visualization not only helps in understanding complex relationships between concepts but also sparks creativity by revealing unexpected connections, similar to how mind mapping enhances creative thinking through visual organization of information.\n\nCustomization for Personal Preferences\n\nAnother area where Obsidian excels is customization. Users have the ability to tailor their workspace according to their personal preferences. This includes choosing themes that align with their aesthetic tastes and implementing plugins that enhance functionality. Such flexibility caters to diverse user needs and makes Obsidian a tool that evolves alongside your note-taking habits.\n\nWhy Choose Obsidian Over Others?\n\nWhy consider Obsidian over alternatives like Notion or Amplenote? For those who prioritize offline work while exploring intricate idea networks, Obsidian offers an unmatched experience. Its focus on privacy and data control is appealing for security-conscious users.\n\nHowever, while Obsidian is popular for its flexibility and features, it may not suit everyone. Many alternatives might better fit individual needs.\n\nAmong modern note-taking tools, Obsidian challenges the notion that “Roam Research is Ancient,” promoting a future of intuitive and personal knowledge management. For those struggling with forgetfulness despite advanced tools like Obsidian, solutions such as the Constella app can assist in effectively managing notes and tasks.\n\nAmplenote: Boosting Your Productivity with Integrated Task Management Features\n\nAmplenote is a powerful alternative to Roam Research among modern note-taking tools. It stands out by combining note-taking and task management features, providing a comprehensive solution for personal productivity. With Amplenote, your ideas are not just left hanging but are organized into actionable tasks.\n\nNote-Taking Redefined\n\nIn Amplenote, note-taking goes beyond simply writing down thoughts. It creates an environment where ideas and tasks are connected, ensuring that nothing gets forgotten. The tool is built to turn messy thoughts into well-organized action plans, making it an essential tool for those who thrive on being organized.\n\nStay on Track with Calendar Integration\n\nOne of Amplenote’s standout features is its calendar integration. By syncing your notes with a calendar, it offers a visual timeline that helps users stay focused and meet deadlines effectively. This feature works like a personal assistant, gently reminding you of your productivity goals without adding unnecessary stress.\n\nAmplenote shows why some people see Roam Research as outdated; it innovates by addressing current demands in flexible task management and user-friendly design, offering a fresh perspective on productivity tools that could reshape how we handle our daily tasks.\n\nRemNote: Transforming Learning and Memory Retention with Spaced Repetition Techniques\n\nIntroducing RemNote, a tool that seems to have cracked the code for efficient knowledge retention. Its secret weapon? The use of spaced repetition algorithms. Imagine having a digital assistant that knows exactly when to nudge your memory, ensuring you never forget essential information. How many times have we wished our brains came with built-in reminders? RemNote makes that dream a reality.\n\nBut RemNote isn’t just about playing memory games; it’s also about creating a smooth journey through your thoughts. With its unique backlinking capabilities, users can effortlessly navigate between related notes. Picture it as having an intricate web of ideas at your fingertips, where each thread pulls you closer to mastering complex topics.\n\nFor those who’ve found themselves frustrated by the simplicity and limitations of Roam Research, RemNote offers a refreshing alternative. It’s not just another note-taking app; it’s a learning companion eager to enhance how you absorb and connect knowledge. Move over, Roam Research — RemNote is here to redefine what it means to truly know something.\n\nTana: Advanced Organizational Features for Complex Note Structures You Can Easily Manage\n\nTana is a great alternative to Roam Research, offering a sophisticated approach to organizing complex note structures. If you’ve ever felt lost navigating through a digital maze of notes, Tana’s powerful tagging system might just be your guiding star. Tags in Tana aren’t just labels; they’re tools that allow you to categorize and filter information with precision and ease. Imagine having the ability to cut through your data jungle and find exactly what you need, when you need it.\n\nBut what really makes Tana stand out is its block-level transclusion. This might sound complicated, but it’s a game-changer for note management. Transclusion allows you to dynamically link different parts of your notes. It’s like having pieces of a puzzle that can rearrange themselves depending on the picture you’re trying to build at any given moment. This feature not only enhances flexibility but also ensures that your information remains interconnected and coherent.\n\nAnytype: Prioritizing Security without Compromising Functionality in Your Note-Taking Experience\n\nIn the world of note-taking tools, Anytype stands out by addressing a concern that’s becoming increasingly important — data security and privacy. While tools like Notion, Obsidian, Amplenote, RemNote, and Tana focus on enhancing productivity through various innovative features, Anytype takes a different approach by ensuring your data is protected with local storage and encryption measures. This commitment means that your notes are stored directly on your device rather than in the cloud, offering peace of mind for those wary of potential data breaches.\n\nOpen-Source Transparency\n\nBeing an open-source platform, Anytype promotes transparency and community collaboration. Users can explore its codebase, ensuring that no backdoors or unwelcome surprises exist within its architecture. This openness not only builds trust but invites contributions from users eager to enhance the tool’s capabilities.\n\nA Modern Alternative to Roam Research\n\nWhile Roam Research is outdated in tech terms due to its lack of native mobile support and performance issues, Anytype emerges as a modern contender that doesn’t skimp on functionality. Its emphasis on privacy makes it a compelling choice for anyone seeking secure yet efficient alternatives to Roam Research. With resources like this comprehensive guide on how to maximize your productivity with Anytype, users can fully harness the potential of this dynamic tool. So why stick with the old when you can explore these dynamic options?\n\nEmbracing New Tools for an Optimized Note-Taking Experience Beyond Roam Research\n\nSwitching from Roam Research to newer tools is like upgrading from a flip phone to a smartphone. Modern alternatives offer noticeable performance improvements, addressing common grievances about Roam’s sluggishness. These cutting-edge tools provide innovative features such as AI-powered semantic search, meeting the evolving needs of users seeking more than basic functionalities.\n\nThe rise of AI-powered note-taking has significantly transformed productivity. Consider how these tools cater to dynamic user needs:\n\nSemantic Search: AI-powered search functions mean that finding your notes is not about remembering exact phrases but understanding concepts and ideas.\n\nCustomization Options: From block-level transclusion in Tana to Obsidian’s graph-based interface, customization allows each user to tailor their experience.\n\nIntegration Capabilities: Seamless integration with calendars, task management systems, and other productivity tools ensures a cohesive workflow.\n\nThese features collectively create an optimized environment for knowledge management, making the transition from Roam Research not just logical but essential for those seeking efficiency and innovation in their daily processes.\n\nConclusion: It’s Time To Move On From Roam And Embrace A New Era Of Note-Taking Tools!\n\nThe tools we’ve explored, from Notion to Obsidian, each offer unique capabilities that cater to the dynamic and multifaceted needs of modern users.\n\nWhy settle for limitations when you can unlock potential? Embracing these new tools isn’t just about switching platforms; it’s about evolving your approach to information management. As technology advances, so should our methods.\n\nExperiment with versatility: Use Notion’s customizable databases for both personal and collaborative projects.\n\nDive into depth: Let Obsidian’s graph view illuminate connections in your knowledge network.\n\nPrioritize security: Choose Anytype for peace of mind with its encryption measures.\n\nThese aren’t just alternatives; they are enhancements. Adopting a mindset of continuous improvement will ensure you stay ahead in an ever-evolving digital landscape. Your note-taking journey is yours — make it innovative, secure, and impactful.\n\nFAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)\n\nWhy is Roam Research considered ancient?\n\nRoam Research, while popular, has not kept pace with the evolving needs of users and modern features that other note-taking tools offer, leading many to seek alternatives.\n\nWhat are some common limitations of Roam Research?\n\nUsers often face performance issues, a lack of mobile apps for on-the-go access, and security concerns regarding data privacy in Roam Research.\n\nWhat alternatives to Roam Research should I consider?\n\nSome top alternatives include Notion for seamless collaboration, Obsidian for offline knowledge management, Amplenote for integrated task management, RemNote for spaced repetition learning, Tana for advanced organization, and Anytype for enhanced security.\n\nHow does Notion enhance productivity?\n\nNotion offers versatile features suitable for both individuals and teams, including customizable databases and templates that improve user experience and organization.\n\nWhat unique feature does Obsidian provide?\n\nObsidian features a graph view that visually connects notes and ideas, allowing users to customize their experience based on personal preferences.\n\nWhy should I switch from Roam Research to a modern note-taking tool?\n\nSwitching can provide enhanced performance, innovative features like semantic search powered by AI integration, and better support for personal knowledge management needs."
