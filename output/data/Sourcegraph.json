      "# [Open in Editor](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/integration/open_in_editor)\nWith a click of a button, you can jump from any file in Sourcegraph to your preferred editor. It only takes a minute to set up.\n\nGet started\n\nIf you haven’t used the feature, find the button on the right side of your screen:\n\nWhen you click it, a small popup appears where you’ll need to set two things: a projects path and your editor.\n\nThe projects path is the folder where you store your projects. Enter any Linux, Windows, or macOS absolute path.\n\nExample: If your projects path is /home/username/projects, one of your repos is https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/, and you want to open README in the root folder of the repo, then the feature will look for the file at /home/username/project/sourcegraph/README.\n\nThen choose your preferred editor from the list. We support VS Code, Atom, Sublime Text, and JetBrains IDEs ( AppCode, CLion, GoLand, IntelliJ IDEA, PhpStorm, PyCharm, Rider, RubyMine, WebStorm, and all new IDEs that JetBrains releases). If you use a different editor, check out “Advanced config” below.\n\nOnce you click Save, the icon will you’ll be able to jump to your editor from any file in Sourcegraph.\n\nAdvanced config\n\nIf you want to dig deeper, there are a bunch of optional settings to play with. Click your name at the top-right, select Settings, and add the \"openInEditor\": {} key to your user setting JSON.\n\neditorIds: an array of short names of an editor (“vscode”, “idea”, “sublime”, “pycharm”, etc.) or “custom”. This is what you set in the dropdown when you first set up the feature.\n\nNote that the initial setup UI only allows you to select one editor, but if you use multiple editors, you can manually add more. Each of them will have an icon on your toolbar.\n\ncustom.urlPattern: If you set editorId to “custom” then this must be set, too. Use the placeholders “%file”, “%line”, and “%col” to mark where the file path, line number, and column number must be inserted. Example URL pattern for IntelliJ IDEA: idea://open?file=%file&line=%line&column=%col\n\nprojectPaths.default: This is what you set in the form when you first set up the feature: The absolute path on your computer where your git repositories live. All git repos to open have to be cloned under this path with their original names. /Users/yourusername/src is a valid absolute path, ~/src is not. Works both with and without a trailing slash.\n\nprojectPaths.linux: Overwrites the default path on Linux. Handy if you use different environments. Works both with and without a trailing slash.\n\nprojectPaths.mac: Overwrites the default path on macOS. Works both with and without a trailing slash.\n\nprojectPaths.windows: Overwrites the default path on Windows. Works both with and without a trailing backslash.\n\nreplacements: Key-value pairs. Each key will be replaced by the corresponding value in the final URL. Keys are regular expressions, values can contain backreferences ($1, $2, ...).\n\njetbrains.forceApi: Forces using protocol handlers (like idea://open?file=...) or the built-in REST API (http://localhost:63342/api/file...). If omitted, protocol handlers are used if available, otherwise the built-in REST API is used.\n\nvscode.isProjectPathUNCPath: Indicates that the given projects path is a UNC (Universal Naming Convention) path.\n\nvscode.useInsiders: If set, files will open in VS Code Insiders rather than VS Code.\n\nvscode.useSSH: If set, files will open on a remote server via SSH. This requires vscode.remoteHostForSSH to be specified and VS Code extension “Remote Development by Microsoft” installed in your VS Code.\n\nvscode.remoteHostForSSH: The remote host as USER@HOSTNAME. This needs you to install the extension called “Remote Development by Microsoft” in your VS Code.\n\nJust save your settings and enjoy being totally advanced! 😎\n\nExamples\n\nIntelliJ IDEA on macOS\n\nTo open repository files in your Documents directory:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ \"editorIds\":[\"idea\"], \"projectPaths.default\":\"/Users/USERNAME/Documents\" } }\n\nJetBrains IDEs on Windows\n\nNote: We talk about IntelliJ here, but it’s similar for all JetBrains IDEs.\n\nThe idea:// protocol handler does not always work on Windows. If it fails for you, a workaround is to use IntelliJ’s built-in REST API to open files directly from a URL with some extra configuration steps.\n\nAdd this to your Sourcegraph User settings:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ ... \"jetbrains.forceApi\":\"builtInServer\" } }\n\nThen open IntelliJ settings, go to Build, Execution, Deployment | Debugger | Built-in Server, and enable Allow unsigned requests. This allows Sourcegraph to make requests to the built-in server, as stated in JetBrains’ docs.\n\nNote: with this workaround, “Open in Editor” will only work if your IDE is running.\n\nVS Code on macOS\n\nTo open repository files in your Documents directory:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ \"editorIds\":[\"vscode\"], \"projectPaths.default\":\"/Users/USERNAME/Documents\" } }\n\nVS Code on Windows\n\nTo open repository files in your Documents directory:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ \"editorIds\":[\"vscode\"], \"projectPaths.default\":\"C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\Documents\" } }\n\nVS Code on WSL\n\nTo open repository files in your Home directory:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ \"editorIds\":[\"vscode\"], \"projectPaths.default\":\"//wsl$/Ubuntu-18.04/home\" } }\n\nVS Code Insider on Mac\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ ... \"vscode.useInsiders\":true } }\n\nVS Code with different base paths configured for different platforms\n\nUses the assigned path for the detected Operating System when available:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ \"editorIds\":[\"vscode\"], // basePath is required as the default path when no Operating System is detected \"projectPaths.default\":\"/Users/USERNAME/Documents/\", \"projectPaths.windows\":\"/C:/Users/USERNAME/folder/\", \"projectPaths.mac\":\"/Users/USERNAME/folder/\", \"projectPaths.linux\":\"/home/USERNAME/folder/\" } }\n\nReplacement Example 1: Open Remote folders with VS Code on Mac by removing file names\n\nThis requires VS Code extension Remote Development by Microsoft to work.\n\nTo open directory where the repository files reside in a remote server:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ \"editorIds\":[\"custom\"], \"projectPaths.default\":\"/Users/USERNAME/Documents/\", // Replaces USER@HOSTNAME as appropriate. \"custom.urlPattern\":\"vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+USER@HOSTNAME%file\", //removes file name as the vscode-remote protocol handler only supports directory-opening \"replacements\":{\"\\/[^\\/]*$\":\"\"} } }\n\nReplacement Example 2: Add string to final file path\n\nAdds sourcegraph- in front of the string that matches the (?<=Documents\\/)(.*[\\\\\\/]) RegExp pattern, which is the string after Documents/ and before the final slash.\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ \"editorIds\":[\"vscode\"], \"projectPaths.default\":\"/Users/USERNAME/Documents/\", \"replacements\":{\"(?<=Documents\\/)(.*[\\\\\\/])\":\"sourcegraph-$1\"} // vscode://file//Users/USERNAME/Documents/REPO-NAME/package.json => vscode://file//Users/USERNAME/Documents/sourcegraph-REPO-NAME/package.json } }\n\nReplacement Example 3: Remove string from the final file path\n\nRemoves sourcegraph- from the final URL.\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ \"editorIds\":[\"vscode\"], \"projectPaths.default\":\"/Users/USERNAME/Documents/\", \"replacements\":{\"sourcegraph-\":\"\"} // vscode://file//Users/USERNAME/Documents/sourcegraph-REST-OF_REPO-NAME/package.json => vscode://file//Users/USERNAME/Documents/REST-OF_REPO-NAME/package.json } }",

      "# [Sourcegraph docs](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/analytics)\nAnalytics\n\nThe analytics section helps Sourcegraph administrators understand user engagement across the various Sourcegraph features, identify power users, and convey value to internal leaders. Introduced in version 3.42, the section includes analytics breakdowns for our most common features such as Batch Changes, Search Notebooks and search, while also providing basic user-level analytics.\n\nData Visualizations\n\nThe goal of these pages is to help administrators answer any question they might have about how features are being used within their Sourcegraph instance. So far, we have introduced pages for Search, Batch Changes, Code Intel, Search, and Search Notebooks, as well as a general users page.\n\nEach page can visualize the past one week, the past one month, or the path three months of data. For graphs that show user data, the graph can toggle between total users or unique users.\n\nThese graphs pull directly from the event log table within the Sourcegraph instance they are running. There should not be an increase to the storage on disk of these tables due to these new features. Further, no data beyond published ping data is sent back to Sourcegraph.\n\nValue Calculators\n\nEach page also includes a total time saved value which can be used to measure the value Sourcegraph is bringing to your organization. This metric is derived from the configurable calculators below the total time saved value. Each calculator multiplies event log data (ex: number of precise code intel events such as a go-to-definition) by a configurable number of minutes saved per event to arrive at a time saved by the feature.\n\nWe designed this to be configurable by you because we want to...\n\nhelp admins understand the value that is being seen by their organization today.\n\nbe customizable so admins can explore what changes will best increase developer time saved.\n\nThese calculators exist on the Search, Code Intel, Batch Changes, and Notebooks analytics pages. Each calculator looks different as they include metrics specifically designed for that part of the application. Please note that the calculator configuration does not save and will return to the default if you navigate away from the page.\n\nIf you have questions about how this works or about how to convey this value to leaders within your organization, please do not hesitate to reach out to your customer engineer.\n\nFAQ\n\nWho has access to see these improved analytics? Where can I find it?\n\nTo see these new visualizations, you must be a site admin. You can find these under Site Admin section, under the Analytics section of the left-nav bar.\n\nDo these improved analytics require sending data to Sourcegraph?\n\nNo! The processing happens entirely within a your instance so no data is sent in or out of your instance. Further, these improved analytics leverage data already being captured within the event log table of your instance so there is no additional storage or processing required for this change. Basically, customers should notice no perceivable difference to their infrastructure.\n\nHow often is the data updated?\n\nThe data is updated approximately every 24 hours.\n\nHow does this work with the existing usage stats page?\n\nThis new analytics experience has been redesigned from the ground up to provide the most value to administrators. In the future, we plan to deprecate the legacy usage stats page and statistics section once this functionality moved from experimental to generally available.",
      "# [Sourcegraph docs](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/executors)\nExecutors\n\nExecutors are Sourcegraph's solution for running untrusted code in a secure and controllable way. Executors provide a sandbox that can run resource-intensive or untrusted tasks on behalf of the Sourcegraph instance, such as:\n\nAutomatically indexing a repository for precise code navigation\n\nRunning batch changes\n\nInstallation\n\nTo deploy executors for your Sourcegraph instance, follow our executor deployment guide.\n\nWhy use executors?\n\nRunning untrusted code is a core requirement of features such as precise code navigation auto-indexing, and running batch changes server-side.\n\nAuto-indexing jobs, in particular, require the invocation of arbitrary and untrusted code to support the resolution of project dependencies. Invocation of post-install hooks, use of insecure package management tools, and package manager proxy attacks can create opportunities in which an adversary can gain unlimited use of compute or exfiltrate data. The latter outcome is particularly dangerous for on-premise installations of Sourcegraph, which is the chosen option for companies wanting to maintain strict privacy of their code property.\n\nInstead of performing this work within the Sourcegraph instance, where code is available on disk and unprotected internal services are available over the local network, we move untrusted compute into a sandboxed environment, the executor, that has access only to the clone of a single repository on disk (its workspace) and to the public internet.\n\nSandboxing Model\n\nExecutors can be deployed with Firecracker isolation in accordance with our sandboxing model to isolate jobs from each other and the host. This requires executors to be run on machines capable of running Linux KVM extensions. On the most popular cloud providers, this either means running executors on bare-metal machines (AWS) or machines capable of nested virtualization (GCP).\n\nOptionally, executors can be run without using KVM-based isolation, which is less secure but might be easier to run on common machines.\n\nDeciding which executor deployment method to use\n\nDeciding how to deploy the executor depends on your use case. For users that wish to process their untrusted compute in the most secure manner, we recommend leveraging the Firecracker isolation method. For users that have constraints around running nested virtualization, the following flowchart can help you decide which deployment option is best for your environment:\n\nHow it works\n\nExecutor instances are capable of being deployed in a variety of ways. Each runtime varies in how jobs are executed.\n\nLocally with src-cli\n\nUser runs the src (e.g. src batch) command from the command line.\n\nsrc calls the Sourcegraph API to clone a

      "# [Code hosts on AWS without public access](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cloud/private_connectivity_aws)\nAs part of the Enterprise tier, Sourcegraph Cloud supports connecting customer private resources on AWS using AWS Private Link and managed site-to-site VPN solution between GCP (where Sourcegraph Cloud instances are hosted) and AWS, so that access to the private resource is secure and without the need to expose it to the public internet.\n\nHow it works\n\nSourcegraph Cloud is a managed service hosted on GCP. Sourcegraph creates a secure connection between customer AWS Virtual Private Cloud (AWS VPC) and a Sourcegraph-managed AWS account using AWS Private Link. Then, Sourcegraph maintains a secure connection between the Sourcegraph-managed AWS VPC and GCP Project via a managed highly available site-to-site VPN solution.\n\nlink\n\nSteps\n\nInitiate the process\n\nCustomers should reach out to their account manager to initiate the process. The account manager will work with the customer to collect the required information and initiate the process, including but not limited to:\n\nThe DNS name of the private code host, e.g. github.internal.company.net or private artifact registry, e.g. artifactory.internal.company.net.\n\nThe region of the private resource on AWS, e.g. us-east-1.\n\nThe type of TLS certificate used by the private resource: either self-signed by an internal private CA or issued by a public CA.\n\nThe VPC endpoint service name in the format of com.amazonaws.vpce.<REGION>.<VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE_ID>. Learn more from create the VPC Endpoint Service.\n\nCreate the VPC Endpoint Service\n\nWhen a customer has private resources inside the AWS VPC and needs to expose it for Sourcegraph managed AWS VPC, customers can follow AWS Documentation. An example can be found from our handbook.\n\nSourcegraph will provide the Sourcegraph-managed AWS account ARN that needs to be allowlisted in your VPC endpoint service, e.g., arn:aws:iam::$accountId:root. It must be allowlisted by customer before the connection can be established. Note: The AWS account is created exclusively for individual Cloud customers and not shared with others.\n\nThe customer needs to share the following details with Sourcegraph:\n\nVPC endpoint service name in the format of com.amazonaws.vpce.<REGION>.<VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE_ID>.\n\nUpon receiving the details, Sourcegraph will create a connection to the customer's private resource. The customer may need to manually accept the connection request depending on their acceptance settings. Sourcegraph will follow up with the customer to confirm the connection is established.\n\nCreate the private resource connection\n\nOnce the connection to private code host is established, the customer can create the code host connection on their Sourcegraph Cloud instance.\n\nVerify artifact registries are working\n\nOnce the connection to private artifact registry is established, customer might then verify that auto-indexing is working with the private artifact registry by configuring auto-indexing\n\nFAQ\n\nWhy AWS Private Link?\n\nAdvantages of AWS Private Link include:\n\nconnectivity to customer VPC is only available inside AWS network\n\nability to select AWS Principal (AWS Account or more granular) that can connect to customer code host\n\nallows customer to control incoming connections\n\nWhy site-to-site VPN connection between GCP to AWS?\n\nAdvantages of the site-to-site GCP to AWS VPN include:\n\nencrypted connection between Sourcegraph Cloud and customer code host\n\nmultiple tunnels to provide high availability between Cloud instance and customer code host\n\nHow can I restrict access to my private resource?\n\nThe customer has full control over the exposed service and they may terminate the connection at any point.\n\nWhat are the next steps when artifact registry connectivity is working?\n\nOnly if the private artifact registry is protected by authentication, the customer will need to:\n\ncreate executor secrets containing credentials for Sourcegraph to access the private artifact registry - how to configure executor secrets\n\nupdate auto-indexing inference configuration to create additional files from executor secrets for given programming language - how to configure auto-indexing\n\nCan I use self-signed TLS certificate for my private resources?\n\nYes. Please work with your account team to add the certificate chain of your internal CA to site configuration at experimentalFeatures.tls.external.certificates.\n\nWhat is the disaster recovery plan?\n\nFor customers with a disaster recovery plan that can failover the private resource deployment to another region, we recommend the customer to provision VPC endpoint services in the failover region and share the details with Sourcegraph during the onboarding process. In the event of an incident, the customer can reach out to support and request Sourcegraph to failover the connection to the failover region.\n\nFor disaster recovery plan of Sourcegraph Cloud, please reach out to your account team for more information.",
      "# [Sourcegraph docs](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/postgres)\nPostgreSQL\n\nSourcegraph uses several PostgreSQL databases to support various functionality. These databases are:\n\npgsql or primary: responsible for user data and account information\n\ncodeintel-db: provides support for lsif data and part of the code-intelligence\n\nVersion requirements\n\nWe support any version starting from 12.\n\nNOTE: ⚠️ Version 3.26 required only Postgres 9.6. You should check the upgrade docs for your deployment type as well as the database upgrade docs below prior to upgrading to 3.27.\n\nRole requirements\n\nThe user provided to Sourcegraph must have full access to the sg database and be able to create the following extensions:\n\nConfiguring PostgreSQL\n\nUpgrading PostgreSQL\n\nSourcegraph uses PostgreSQL as its main database and this documentation describes how to upgrade PostgreSQL between major versions.\n\nWARNING: Upgrading the PostgreSQL database requires stopping your Sourcegraph deployment which will result in downtime.\n\nNOTE: If you running PostgreSQL externally, see Upgrading external PostgreSQL instances\n\nUpgrading external PostgreSQL instances\n\nWhen running an external PostgreSQL instance, please do the following:\n\nBack up the Postgres DB so that you can restore to the old version should anything go wrong.\n\nTurn off Sourcegraph entirely (bring down all containers and pods so they cannot talk to Postgres.)\n\nUpgrade Postgres to the latest version following your provider's instruction or your preferred method:\n\nAWS RDS\n\nAWS Aurora\n\nGCP CloudSQL\n\nAzure DB\n\nHeroku\n\nEnterpriseDB\n\nCitus\n\nAiven PostgreSQL\n\nYour own PostgreSQL\n\nTurn Sourcegraph back on connecting to the now-upgraded database.\n\nWARNING: Do not allow Sourcegraph to run/connect to the new Postgres database until it has been fully populated with your data. Doing so could result in Sourcegraph trying to create e.g. a new DB schema and partially migrating. If this happens to you, restore from the backup you previously took or contact us ([email protected])\n\nUpgrading internal PostgreSQL instances\n\nMany of Sourcegraph's deployment methods come with internal PostgreSQL instances that can be deployed as part of a Sourcegraph installation. This section outlines how to upgrade these databases.\n\nSourcegraph with Docker Compose\n\nGenerally, no additional steps are required to upgrade the databases shipped alongside Sourcegraph with Docker Compose.\n\nSourcegraph with Kubernetes\n\nThe upgrade process is different for Sourcegraph Kubernetes deployments because by default, it uses sourcegraph/postgres-12 which can be customized with environment variables.\n\nIf you have changed PGUSER, PGDATABASE or PGDATA, then the PG*OLD and PG*NEW environment variables are required. Below are the defaults and documentation on what each variable is used for:\n\nPOSTGRES_PASSWORD='': Password of PGUSERNEW if it is newly created (i.e when PGUSERNEW didn't exist in the old database).\n\nPGUSEROLD=sg: A user that exists in the old database that can be used to authenticate intermediate upgrade operations.\n\nPGUSERNEW=sg: A user that must exist in the new database after the upgrade is done (i.e. it'll be created if it didn't exist already).\n\nPGDATABASEOLD=sg: A database that exists in the old database that can be used to authenticate intermediate upgrade operations. (e.g psql -d)\n\nPGDATABASENEW=sg: A database that must exist in the new database after the upgrade is done (i.e. it'll be created if it didn't exist already).\n\nPGDATAOLD=/data/pgdata-11: The data directory containing the files of the old PostgreSQL database to be upgraded.\n\nPGDATANEW=/data/pgdata-12: The data directory containing the upgraded PostgreSQL data files, used by the new version of PostgreSQL.\n\nAdditionally, the upgrade process assumes it can write to the parent directory of PGDATAOLD.\n\nRequirements for upgrading from Postgres 11 to 12 for Kubernetes\n\nThis guide is for the Sourcegraph 3.27 release. The migration to Postgres 12 using the Sourcegraph provided Postgres images is largely automated. However, you should take some steps before the migration. For the 3.27 release, these apply to the pgsql & codeintel-db deployments.\n\nInform your users prior to starting the upgrade that Sourcegraph will take downtime. This downtime scales with the size and resources allocated to the Postgres database instances.\n\nTake snapshots of all Sourcegraph Postgres databases. You can find the backing disk in your cloud by describing the relevant PersistentVolumes.\n\nEnsure that the size of the disks backing the databases are under 50% utilization. (You will need up-to 2x the size of your current database to do the migration). In most cases Kubernetes can expand the size of the volume for you, see the relevant kubernetes docs here.\n\nYou can use kubectl exec -it $DB_POD_NAME -- df -h. By default, the database will be mounted under /data/.\n\nSingle-container Sourcegraph\n\nWhen running a new version of Sourcegraph, single-container Sourcegraph with Docker instances will check if the PostgreSQL data needs upgrading upon initialization.\n\nSee the following steps to upgrade between major postgresql versions:\n\n1. Stop the sourcegraph/server container.\n\n2. Save this script and give it executable permissions (chmod + x).\n\nNOTE: The script presumes your data is being upgraded from 11 to 12 and your Sourcegraph directory is at ~/.sourcegraph/. Change the values in the code below if that's not the case.\n\n3. Execute the script.",
      "# [Administration FAQ](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/faq)\nHow does Sourcegraph store repositories on disk?\n\nSourcegraph stores bare Git repositories (without a working tree), which is a complete mirror of the repository on your code host.\n\nIf you are keen for more details on what bare Git repositories are, check out this discussion on StackOverflow.\n\nThe directories should contain just a few files and directories, namely: HEAD, config, description, hooks, info, objects, packed-refs, refs\n\nDoes Sourcegraph support svn?\n\nFor Subversion and other non-Git code hosts, the recommended way to make these accessible in Sourcegraph is through src-expose.\n\nAlternatively, you can use git-svn or svg2git to convert Subversion repositories to Git repositories. Unlike src-expose, this will preserve commit history, but is generally much slower.\n\nHow do I access Sourcegraph if my authentication provider experiences an outage?\n\nIf you are using an external authentication provider and the provider experiences an outage, users will be unable to sign into Sourcegraph. A site administrator can configure an alternate sign-in method by modifying the auth.providers field in site configuration. However, the site administrator may themselves be unable to sign in. If this is the case, then a site administrator can update the configuration if they have direct docker exec or kubectl exec access to the Sourcegraph instance. Follow the instructions to update the site config if the web UI is inaccessible.\n\nHow do I set up redirect URLs in Sourcegraph?\n\nSometimes URLs in Sourcegraph may change. For example, if a code host configuration is updated to use a different repositoryPathPattern, this will change the repository URLs on Sourcegraph. Users may wish to preserve links to the old URLs, and this requires adding redirects.\n\nWe recommend configuring redirects in a reverse proxy. If you are running Sourcegraph as a single Docker image, you can deploy a reverse proxy such as Caddy or NGINX in front of it. Refer to the Caddy or NGINX documentation for URL rewrites.\n\nIf you are running Sourcegraph as a Kubernetes cluster, you have two additional options:\n\nIf you are using NGINX ingress (kubectl get ingress | grep sourcegraph-frontend), modify sourcegraph-frontend.Ingress.yaml by adding a rewrite rule.\n\nWhat external HTTP checks are configured?\n\nWe leave the choice of which external HTTP check monitor up to our users. What we provide out-of-the-box is extensive metrics monitoring through Prometheus and Grafana, with builtin alert thresholds and dashboards, and Kubernetes/Docker HTTP health checks which verify that the server is running. Sourcegraph's frontend has a default health check at https://$SOURCEGRAPH_BASE_URL/healthz. Some users choose to set up their own external HTTP health checker which tests if the homepage loads, a repository page loads, and if a search GraphQL request returns successfully.\n\nMonitoring\n\nPlease visit our Observability Docs for more in-depth information about observability in Sourcegraph.\n\nWhat should I look at when my instance is having performance issues?\n\nSourcegraph comes with built-in monitoring in the form of Grafana, connected to Prometheus for metrics and alerting.\n\nGenerally, Grafana should be the first stop you make when experiencing a system performance issue. From there you can look for system alerts or metrics that would provide you with more insights on what’s causing the performance issue. You can learn more about accessing Grafana here.\n\nWhat are the key values/alerts to look for when looking at the Grafana Dashboard?\n\nPlease refer to the Dashboards guide for more on how to use our Grafana dashboards.\n\nPlease refer to Understanding alerts for examples and suggested actions for alerts.\n\nHow do I know when more resources are needed for a specified service?\n\nAll resource dashboards contain a section called Provisioning indicators that provide information about the current resource usage of containers. These can be used to determine if a scale-up is needed (example panel).\n\nMore information on each available panel in the dashboards is available in the Dashboards reference.\n\nWhat does this <ALERT-MESSAGE> mean?\n\nSee Alert solutions to learn about each alert and their possible solutions.\n\nWhat’s the threshold for each resource?\n\nAll resources dashboards contain a section called Container monitoring that indicate thresholds at which alerts will fire for each resource (example alert).\n\nMore information on each available panel in the dashboards is available in the Dashboards reference.\n\nHow much resources should I add after receiving alerts about running out of resources?\n\nYou should make the decision based on the metrics from the relevant Grafana dashboard linked in each alert.\n\nWhat are some of the important alerts that I should be aware of?\n\nWe recommend paying closer attention to critical alerts.\n\nHow do I set up alerts?\n\nPlease refer to our guide on setting up alerting.\n\nHow do I create a custom alert?\n\nCreating a custom alert is not recommended and currently not supported by Sourcegraph. However, please provide feedback on the monitoring dashboards and alerts if you find anything could be improved via our issue tracker.\n\nMore advanced users can also refer to our FAQ item about custom consumption of Sourcegraph metrics.\n\nCan I consume Sourcegraph's metrics in my own monitoring system (Datadog, New Relic, etc.)?\n\nSourcegraph provides high-level alerting metrics which you can integrate into your own monitoring system—see the alerting custom consumption guide for more details.\n\nWhile it is technically possible to consume all of Sourcegraph's metrics in an external system, our recommendation is to utilize the builtin monitoring tools and configure Sourcegraph to send alerts to your own PagerDuty, Slack, email, etc.. Metrics and thresholds can change with each release, therefore manually defining the alerts required to monitor Sourcegraph's health is not recommended. Sourcegraph automatically updates the dashboards and alerts on each release to ensure the displayed information is up-to-date.\n\nOther monitoring systems that support Prometheus scraping (for example, Datadog and New Relic) or Prometheus federation can be configured to federate Sourcegraph's high-level alerting metrics. For information on how to configure those systems, please check your provider's documentation.\n\nI am getting \"Error: Cluster information not available\" in the Instrumentation page, what should I do?\n\nThis error is expected if your instance was not deployed with Kubernetes. The Instrumentation page is currently only available for Kubernetes instances.\n\nTroubleshooting",

      "# [Troubleshooting guide](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/observability/troubleshooting)\nThis is a guide for investigating errors and performance issues, with the goal of resolving the issue or generating a high-quality issue report.\n\nHow to use this guide:\n\nScan through Specific scenarios to see if any of these applies to you. If any do, follow the instructions in the subsection.\n\nScan through General scenarios to find which scenario(s) applies to you. If any do, follow the instructions to update your instance or collect information for the issue report.\n\nIf you cannot resolve the issue on your own, file an issue on the Sourcegraph issue tracker with the collected information. Enterprise customers may alternatively file a support ticket or email [email protected].\n\nNOTE: This guide assumes you have site admin privileges on the Sourcegraph instance. If you are non-admin user, report your error the site admin and have them walk through this guide.\n\nSpecific scenarios\n\nScenario: search and code pages take a long time to load\n\nIf this is the case, this could indicate high gitserver load. To confirm, take the following steps:\n\nOpen Grafana.\n\nIf using Sourcegraph 3.14: Simply check if either of these alerts are firing:\n\ngitserver: 50+ concurrent command executions (abnormally high load)\n\ngitserver: echo command execution duration exceeding 1s\n\nIf using an older version of Sourcegraph:\n\nGo to the Sourcegraph Internal > Gitserver rev2 dashboard.\n\nExamine the \"Echo Duration Seconds\" dashboard (tracks the src_gitserver_echo_duration_seconds metric) and \"Commands running concurrently\" dashboard (tracks the src_gitserver_exec_running metric). If either of these is high (> 1s echo duration or 100s simultaneous execs), then this indicates gitserver is under heavy load and likely the bottleneck.\n\nConfirm your gitserver is not under-provisioned, by e.g. comparing its allocated resources with what the resource estimator shows.\n\nSolution: set USE_ENHANCED_LANGUAGE_DETECTION=false in the Sourcegraph runtime environment.\n\nScenario: no cloning, syncing, updating or deleting is happening\n\nObserved state: Sourcegraph instance does not react to any updates to code hosts and no cloning is happening. The cause of this state could be repo-updater queries that are too large for the limits of the running Postgres DB. One symptom is seeing a line like the one below in the repo-updater logs:\n\nt=2020-05-28T18:41:02+0000 lvl=eror msg=Syncer error=\"syncer.sync.store.upsert-repos: delete: driver: bad connection\n\nor seeing the same error in the \"Code host status panel\" (Clicking the cloud icon).\n\nThe fix is to increase the memory on Postgres DB which will increase certain Postgres-internal limits and will allow the queries from repo-updater to go through.\n\nAnother cause could be that the repo-updater is in a crash loop for some reason. If there are large numbers of repos to be updated it could be from Out of memory errors. A fix here is to increase the memory for repo-updater instead.\n\nGeneral scenarios\n\nThis section contains a list of scenarios, each of which contains instructions that include actions that are appropriate to the scenario. Note that more than one scenario may apply to a given issue.\n\nScenario: the issue is NOT performance-related and there is a consistent reproduction.\n\nRecord the following information in the issue report:\n\nReproduction steps\n\nA screenshot of the error page or error message\n\nThe output of the browser developer console\n\nLog output while reproducing the issue\n\nSourcegraph configuration\n\nWhen was the most recent update or deployment change applied?\n\nScenario: the issue is NOT performance-related, but it is hard to reproduce.\n\nWithout a consistent reproduction, the issue will be harder to diagnose, so we recommend trying to find a repro if possible. If that isn't possible, file an issue with the following information:\n\nSteps the user took before encountering the issue, including as much detail as possible.\n\nBad example: \"User encountered a 502 error when trying to search for something.\"\n\nGood example: \"User encountered a 502 error on the search results page when trying to conduct a global search for the following query. On refresh, the search worked with no error. The desired result appears in our main repository, which is rather large (takes about a minute to fully clone). The issue doesn't reproduce consistently, but we saw two other reports like this around 2pm PT yesterday, during peak usage hours.\"\n\nExamine the error rates for any anomalies.\n\nIf you know the approximate time the issue occurred or if there is a spike in error rate around a certain time, copy the logs around that time.\n\nNote any pattern in the issue reports. E.g., did users encountering the issue all visit the same repository or belong to the same organization. Do site admins encounter the issue or only non-admin users?\n\nSourcegraph configuration\n\nWhen was the most recent update or deployment change applied?\n\nScenario: the issue is performance-related and there is a consistent reproduction\n\nInclude the reproduction steps in the error report, along with relevant context (e.g., repository size).\n\nBad example: \"User did a search and it timed out.\"\n\nGood example: \"User issued the following search query in the following repository. The repository is one of our larger repositories (takes about 1 minute to fully clone and the size of the .git directory is 5GB). The results page took about 60 seconds to load and when it finally did, the results was an error message that said 'timeout'\".\n\nOpen the browser developer network panel and identify slow requests.\n\nUse Jaeger to drill down into slow requests and understand which components of the request are slow. Remember that many Sourcegraph API requests identify the Jaeger trace ID in the x-trace HTTP response header, which makes it easy to look up the trace corresponding to a particular request.\n\nIf Jaeger is unavailable or unreliable, you can collect trace data from the Go net/trace endpoint.\n\nCopy the Sourcegraph configuration to the error report.\n\nScenario: the issue is performance-related and there is NOT a consistent reproduction\n\nWithout a consistent reproduction, the issue will be harder to diagnose, so we recommend trying to find a repro if possible. If that isn't possible, try the following:\n\nExamine resource usage, usage stats, and error rates over time in Grafana and Prometheus.\n\nAre there spikes in latencies or error rate over time?\n\nAre there spikes in usage or traffic over time that correlate with when the issue is reported.\n\nAre there spikes in memory usage, CPU, or disk usage over time?\n\nIf you know the approximate time the issue occurred or if there is a suspicious spike in metrics around a certain time, check the logs around that time.\n\nIf the issue is ongoing or if you know the time during which the issue occurred, search Jaeger for long-running request traces in the appropriate time window.\n\nIf Jaeger is unavailable, you can alternatively use the Go net/trace endpoint. (You will have to scan the traces for each service to look for slow traces.)\n\nIf tracing points to a specific service as the source of high latency, examine the logs and net/trace info for that service.\n\nScenario: multiple actions are slow or Sourcegraph as a whole feels sluggish\n\nIf Sourcegraph feels sluggish overall, the likely culprit is resource allocation.\n\nNOTE: some of these recommendations involve increasing the replica or shard count of individual services. This is only possible when Sourcegraph is deployed into a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nExamine memory, CPU, and disk usage metrics.\n\nIf the metrics indicate high resource consumption, adjust the resource allocation higher.\n\nIf metrics are unavailable or inaccessible, here is a rough correspondence between end-user slowness and the services that are usually the culprit:\n\nGlobal search (i.e., no repository scope is specified) results page takes a long time to load.\n\nIncrease indexed-search memory limit or CPU limit. The number of indexed-search shards can also be increased if using Sourcegraph on Kubernetes.\n\nSearch results show up quickly, but code snippets take awhile to populate. File contents take awhile to load.\n\nIncrease gitserver memory usage. Gitserver memory may be the bottleneck, especially if there are many repositories or repositories are large.\n\nIncrease number of gitserver shards. This can help if memory is the bottleneck. It can also help if there are too many repositories per shard. Gitserver \"shells out\" to git for every repository data request, so a high volume of user traffic that generates many simultaneous requests for many repositories can lead to a spike in Linux process exec latency.\n\nIncrease memory and CPU limit of syntect-server. This helps if syntax highlighting is the bottleneck.\n\nMultiple UI pages take awhile to load.\n\nIncrease frontend CPU and memory limit.\n\nSearches show intermittent HTTP 502 errors or timeouts, possibly concurrent with frontend container restarts.\n\nIncrease frontend memory and CPU. This may indicate the frontend is running out of memory when loading search results. This can be a problem when dealing with large monorepos.\n\nIf it is unclear which service is underallocated, examine Jaeger to identify long-running traces and see which services take up the most time.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the Go net/trace endpoint to pull trace data.\n\nScenario: Prometheus scraping metrics outside Sourcegraph Kubernetes namespace\n\nIf you are seeing cAdvisor metrics from a namespace outside of the one Sourcegraph is currently deployed into.\n\nUncomment our namespaced Prometheus cAdvisor configuration\n\nApply this configuration and restart Prometheus\n\nNote: This is unneeded if you are using the 'namespaced' overlay\n\nScenario: search timeouts\n\nIf your users are experiencing search timeouts or search performance issues, please perform the following steps:\n\nTry appending variations of index:only, timeout:60s and count:999999 to the search query to see if it is still slow.\n\nAccess Grafana directly.\n\nSelect the + icon on the left-hand side, then choose Import.\n\nPaste this JSON into the input and click Load.\n\nOnce the dashboard appears, include screenshots of the entire dashboard in the issue report.\n\nInclude the logs of zoekt-webserver container in the indexed-search pods. If you are using single Docker container enable debug logs first.\n\nScenario: zoekt-webserver is in a CrashloopBackOff and err cannot allocate memory\n\nSourcegraph uses a mmap to store its indices. The default operating system limits on mmap counts may to be too low, which may result in out of memory exceptions. If you are seeing this error on large scale deployments with a lot repos to be indexed, please use the following steps to verify the source of the errors:\n\nEnsure pods are not actually running out of allocated memory and being OOMKilled by running (if they are, then you should give them more memory and the below will not help you):\n\nkubectl top pod indexed-search-<pod_number> kubectl describe nodes\n\nOn the host operating system execute sudo sysctl -n vm.max_map_count.\n\n$ sysctl -n vm.max_map_count 65530\n\nCalculate the number of repos in your deployment divided by the number of indexed-search replicas. For example:\n\n250,000 repositories / 2 indexed-search repliacas = 125,000 repos to index per replica.\n\nIf the vm.max_map_count is lower than the result of the above calculation. Adjust the vm.max_map_count by executing:\n\nsudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144\n\nVerify the change.\n\n$ sudo sysctl -n vm.max_map_count 262144\n\nEnsure the change will persist a system reboot by updating the vm.max_map_count setting in /etc/sysctl.conf.\n\nScenario: zoekt-webserver is restarting due to watchdog\n\nzoekt-webserver has a built in watchdog which ensures it can respond to search requests. If the watchdog fails, it will panic causing the process to exit with a non-zero exit code. This is like a Kubernetes health check, but works across all our deployment environments.\n\nBy default the watchdog runs every 30s. If the watchdog fails 3 consecutive times (with a 30s sleep in-between) it will trigger the panic. This is usually indicative a server which is consistently overloaded. It is recommended to increase the CPU quota assigned to it or horizontally scale to more replicas.\n\nFrom Sourcegraph 3.22 you can configure the watchdog via environment variables:\n\nZOEKT_WATCHDOG_TICK :: Duration of how often it runs. (default 30s)\n\nZOEKT_WATCHDOG_ERRORS :: Consecutive error count before exit. (default 3)\n\nIf either is 0 the watchdog is disabled.\n\nYou can further diagnose an overloaded zoekt-webserver via watchdog logs or metrics. See log messages mentioning watchdog, or view the following metrics in grafana:\n\nzoekt_webserver_watchdog_errors :: The current error count for zoekt watchdog.\n\nzoekt_webserver_watchdog_total :: The total number of requests done by zoekt watchdog.\n\nzoekt_webserver_watchdog_errors_total :: The total number of errors from zoekt watchdog.\n\nActions\n\nThis section contains various actions that can be taken to collect information or update Sourcegraph in order to resolve an error or performance issue. You should typically not read this section directly, but start with the General scenarios section to determine which actions are appropriate.\n\nCheck browser console\n\nOpen the browser JavaScript console (right-click in the browser > Inspect to open developer tools, then click the Console tab).\n\nCheck browser network panel\n\nOpen the browser developer network page (right-click in the browser > Inspect to open developer tools, then click the Network tab).\n\nIf you are new to the network page, check out this great introduction to the Chrome developer tools Network panel.\n\nCheck the waterfall diagram at the top and the Waterfall column in the list of network requests to quickly identify high-latency requests.\n\nClicking on a request will open up a panel that provides additional details about the request.\n\nIf a GraphQL request is taking a long time, you should obtain its Jaeger trace ID by inspecting the Headers tab of this panel and finding the X-Trace or x-trace response header value. Once you've obtained this trace ID, look it up in Jaeger.\n\nYou can check Preserve log to preserve the list of requests across page loads and reloads.\n\nCheck resource usage\n\nAccess Prometheus and examine the following metrics:\n\nMemory: process_resident_memory_bytes is a gauge that tracks memory usage per backend process.\n\nExample: process_resident_memory_bytes{app=\"indexed-search\"} shows memory usage for each indexed-search instance.\n\nCPU: process_cpu_seconds_total is a counter that tracks cumulative CPU seconds used .\n\nExample: rate(process_cpu_seconds_total{app=\"sourcegraph-frontend\"}[1m]) shows average CPU usage for each sourcegraph-frontend instance over the last minute.\n\nDisk: gitserver_disk_free_percent is a gauge that tracks free disk space on gitserver.\n\nCheck end-user stats\n\nGo to /site-admin/usage-statistics to view daily, weekly, and monthly user statistics.\n\nTo drill down (e.g., into sub-daily traffic, visits per page type, latencies, etc.), access Grafana and visit the Sourcegraph Internal > HTTP dashboard page, which includes the following panels:\n\nQPS by Status Code\n\nQPS by URL Route\n\nP90 Request Duration (request latency at the 90th percentile)\n\nGrafana contains ready-made dashboards derived from Prometheus metrics. Any chart in Grafana mentioned here can be viewed in Prometheus by clicking the dropdown menu next to the Grafana panel title > Edit > copying the expression in the Metrics field.\n\nCheck error rates\n\nAccess Grafana and view the following charts:\n\nFolder: Sourcegraph Internal > Dashboard: HTTP > Chart: QPS by Status Code\n\nThis shows request rates by HTTP status code for end-user requests.\n\nFolder: General\n\nThis contains dashboards for each core service in Sourcegraph. Examine each for high-level metrics important to the health of each service.\n\nCollect a Jaeger trace\n\nIf you are looking for the trace associated with a specific request,\n\nFind the trace ID in the HTTP response in the browser developer tools \"Network\" tab.\n\nAccess Jaeger and look up the trace ID.\n\nIf you do not have a specific request or cannot find the trace ID,\n\nAccess Jaeger.\n\nSearch for a matching span by setting the appropriate fields in the sidebar.\n\n2 ways: start with a span ID, or manually locate your span by searching the Jaeger GUI\n\nExamine logs\n\nIf you are using the single Docker container or Docker Compose deployment option, logs are printed to stdout and stderr. You should be able to access these using your infrastructure provider's standard log viewing mechanism.\n\nIf you are using Kubernetes,\n\nRetrieve logs with kubectl logs $POD_ID.\n\nTail logs with kubectl logs -f $POD_ID.\n\nIf a pod container died, you can access the previous container logs with kubectl logs -p $POD_ID. This can be useful for diagnosing why a container crashed.\n\nYou can tail logs for all pods associated with a given deployment: kubectl logs -f deployment/sourcegraph-frontend --container=frontend --since=10m\n\nExamine Go net/trace\n\nEach core service has an endpoint which displays traces using Go's net/trace package.\n\nTo access this data,\n\nFirst ensure you are logged in as a site admin.\n\nGo to the URL path /-/debug. This page should show a list of links with the names of each core service (e.g., frontend, gitserver, etc.)\n\nClick on the service you'd like to examine.\n\nClick \"Requests`. This brings you to a page where you can view traces for that service.\n\nYou can filter to traces by duration or error state.\n\nYou can show histograms of durations by minute, hour, or in total (since the process started)\n\nOn older versions of Sourcegraph on Kubernetes, the /-/debug URL path may be inaccessible. If this is the case, you'll need to forward port 6060 on the main container of a given pod to access its traces. For example, to access to traces of the first gitserver shard,\n\nkubectl port-forward gitserver-0 6060\n\nGo to http://localhost:6060 in your browser, and click on \"Requests\".\n\nCopy configuration\n\nGo the the URL path /site-admin/report-bug to obtain an all-in-one text box of all Sourcegraph configuration (which includes site configuration, code host configuration, and global settings). This lets you easily copy all configuration to an issue report (NOTE: remember to redact any secrets).\n\nCollect instance stats\n\nThe following statistics are useful background context when reporting a performance issue:\n\nNumber of repositories (can be found on the /site-admin/repositories page, search for \"repositories total\")\n\nSize distribution of repositories (e.g., are there one or more large \"monorepos\" that contain most of the code?)\n\nNumber of users and daily usage stats from /site-admin/usage-statistics",
      "# [Code Insights repository scope](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/code_insights/references/repository_scope)\nA Code Insight runs on a list of repositories as specified on insight creation. The scope options are:\n\nManually specify a list of repositories\n\nRun the insight over all repositories (Sourcegraph 3.31.1+).\n\nFrom Sourcegraph 4.5 this is achieved through a repo:.* search query.\n\nRun the insight over repositories as returned from a repository search query (Sourcegraph 4.5+)\n\nThis replaces the \"Run your insight over all repositories\" checkbox in prior versions\n\nUsing the repository search query box\n\nThe repository search query box allows you to search for repositories on your Sourcegraph instance using standard Sourcegraph repo filters, as well as boolean operators.\n\nSome example use cases might be:\n\nI want my insight to run over all the repositories in the sourcegraph organisation, but not the handbook repository\n\nI want my insight to run over all my repositories that have github-actions\n\nThe repository search box functions as the Sourcegraph search box, so it will suggest repository names as you type.\n\nRefining and previewing your repositories\n\nAfter writing your repository search query, the Code Insights creation UI will display how many repositories the query has resolved.\n\nIf this number is unexpected, you can preview the repositories using the Preview results link.\n\nNOTE: Repositories will include archived repositories and forks by default.\n\nHow is the list of repositories resolved?\n\nIf you are using a search query to define the list of repositories to run your insight over, then:",
      "# [Common reasons code insights may not match search results](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/code_insights/references/common_reasons_code_insights_may_not_match_search_results)\nThere are a few reasons why chart data series' most recent datapoint may show you a different number of match counts than the same search query run in Sourcegraph manually.\n\nIf the chart data point shows higher counts than a manual search\n\n[For versions pre-3.40] Not including fork:no and archived:no in your insight query\n\nBecause code insights historical search defaults to fork:yes and archived:yes, but a Sourcegraph search via the web interface or CLI does not, it may be that your insight data series is including results from repositories that are excluded from a Sourcegraph search. Try running the same search again manually with fork:yes and archived:yes filters.\n\nNOTE: 3.40+ version defaults to fork:no and archived:no, the same way the search UI does.\n\nManual search will not include unindexed repositories\n\nAll repositories in a historical search are unindexed, but a manual Sourcegraph search only includes indexed repositories. It's possible your manual searches are missing results from unindexed repositories.\n\nTo investigate this, one can compare the list of repositories in the manual search (use a select:repository filter) with the list of repositories in the insight series_points database table. To see why a repository may not be indexing, refer to this guide.\n\nIf the chart data point shows lower counts than a manual search\n\nNew matches created since the insight datapoint ran\n\nCurrently, a data series' most recent datapoint defaults to the end of the prior month. It's possible that in the time between when your insight ran and when you ran a manual search, new matches have been added to your codebase. To confirm this, you can run type:diff or type:commit searches using the after: filter, but note that those filters only support up to 10,000 repositories, so you may first need to limit your search repository set.\n\nNOTE: Future releases of Code Insights may include an always-up-to-date present-time point.\n\nRepository timeouts caused a datapoint to miss results\n\nIf your code insight is very large, it is possible that a few (<1% in 100+ manual tests over 26,000 repositories) repositories failed to return match counts due to timing out while searching. To check this, you can run the following GraphQL query in the Sourcegraph GraphQL API:\n\nwhere INSIGHT_ID can be found in the \"edit\" page for the insight (selectable from the three-dot dropdown on the insight) after ...edit/. It will look like https://yourdomain.sourcegraph.com/insights/edit/INSIGHT_ID?dashboardId=all. The INSIGHT_ID can also be found in the url of the single insight view found by clicking on the title of the insight. The ID will be in the url, for example, https://sourcegraph.yourdomain.com/insights/insight/{INSIGHT_ID}",

      "# [Metrics and dashboards](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/observability/metrics)\nSourcegraph ships with Grafana for dashboards, Prometheus for metrics and alerting. We also provide built-in alerting for these metrics.\n\nGrafana\n\nSite admins can view the Grafana monitoring dashboards on a Sourcegraph instance:\n\nGo to User menu > Site admin.\n\nOpen the Monitoring page from the link in the left sidebar. The URL is https://sourcegraph.example.com/-/debug/grafana/.\n\nDashboards\n\nA complete dashboard reference is available for more context on our available service dashboards and panels.\n\nAdditional dashboards can also be set up—see Grafana configuration for more details.\n\nView documentation\n\nOn service dashboards, each metric panel has links attached that lead to relevant alert solutions or panel documentation. These can be accessed from the top left corner of each panel.\n\nView alerts\n\nThe Overview dashboard includes a high-level summary of alert events across all Sourcegraph services.\n\nOn service dashboards, a summary of alert events for that service is available. Alerts can be filtered by level using the \"Filter alert level\" selector at the top of the dashboard. This information can be overlaid on all panels in that dashboard by enabling the \"Alert events\" toggle.\n\nView version change events\n\nOn service dashboards, annotations can be displayed for occasions when a Sourcegraph version change is detected by enabling the \"Version changes\" toggle at the top of the dashboard. This can be useful for correlating metrics and alerts with Sourcegraph deployment and upgrade events.\n\nQuerying metrics\n\nSpecific metrics can be queried using Grafana's Explore panel, available at /-/debug/grafana/explore on your Sourcegraph instance. The query for each individual panel can be viewed and explored by clicking on the panel and using the \"Explore\" option.\n\nGrafana configuration\n\nSourcegraph deploys a customized image of Grafana, which ships with Sourcegraph-specific dashboard definitions.\n\nTo provide custom dashboards, a directory containing dashboard JSON specifications can be mounted in the Docker container at /sg_grafana_additional_dashboards. Changes to files in that directory will be detected automatically while Grafana is running.\n\nMore behavior can be controlled with environmental variables.\n\nNOTE: There is a known issue where attempting to edit anything using the Grafana UI will result in a 403 response with \"invalid CSRF token\". As a workaround, site admins can connect to Grafana directly to make changes using the Grafana UI.\n\nAccessing Grafana directly\n\nFor most use cases, you can access Grafana through your Sourcegraph instance. Follow the instructions below to access Grafana directly to, for example, edit configuration directly.\n\nNOTE: Most of the dashboards that Sourcegraph ships with are not configurable through the Grafana UI. In general, we recommend these configuration methods instead.\n\nIf you are using the Kubernetes deployment option, you can access Grafana directly using Kubernetes port forwarding to your local machine:\n\nGrafana will be available http://localhost:3370/-/debug/grafana.\n\nIf you are using Docker Single Container or the Docker Compose deployment option, Grafana is available locally at http://localhost:3370/-/debug/grafana without any additional setup. If Sourcegraph is deployed to a remote server, then access via an SSH tunnel using a tool such as sshuttle is required to establish a secure connection to Grafana. To access the remote server using sshuttle from your local machine:\n\nGrafana will be available at http://host:3370/-/debug/grafana.\n\nWARNING: Our Grafana instance runs in anonymous mode with all authentication turned off, since we rely on Sourcegraph's built-in authentication. Please be careful when exposing it directly to external traffic.\n\nPrometheus\n\nPrometheus is a monitoring tool that collects application- and system-level metrics over time and makes these accessible through a robust query language.\n\nFor most use cases, you can query Prometheus through Grafana using Grafana's Explore panel, available at /-/debug/grafana/explore on your Sourcegraph instance, or simply rely on the dashboards we ship.\n\nAvailable metrics\n\nHigh-level alerting metrics\n\nSourcegraph's metrics include a single high-level metric alert_count which indicates the number of level=critical and level=warning alerts each service has fired over time for each Sourcegraph service. This is the same metric presented on the Overview Grafana dashboard.\n\nNOTE: We provide built-in alerting for these alerting metrics to help monitor the health of your Sourcegraph instance. Refer to our alert solutions reference for details on specific alerts.\n\nDescription: The number of alerts each service has fired for a given alert name and severity level.\n\nValues: Although the values of alert_count are floating-point numbers, only their whole numbers have meaning. For example, 0.5 and 0.7 indicate no alerts are firing, while 1.2 indicates exactly one alert is firing and 3.0 indicates exactly three alerts firing.\n\nLabels:\n\nComplete reference\n\nA complete reference of Sourcegraph's vast set of Prometheus metrics is not yet available. If you are interested in this, please reach out by filing an issue or contacting us at [email protected].\n\nPrometheus configuration\n\nSourcegraph runs a customized image of Prometheus, which packages a standard Prometheus installation together with rules files and target files tailored to Sourcegraph and quality-of-life integrations such as the ability to configure alerting from the Sourcegraph web application.\n\nA directory can be mounted at /sg_prometheus_add_ons. It can contain additional config files of two types:\n\nrule files which must have the suffix _rules.yml in their filename (ie gitserver_rules.yml)\n\ntarget files which must have the suffix _targets.yml in their filename (ie local_targets.yml)\n\nRule files and target files must use the latest Prometheus 2.x syntax.\n\nThe environment variable PROMETHEUS_ADDITIONAL_FLAGS can be used to pass on additional flags to the prometheus executable running in the container.\n\nAccessing Prometheus directly\n\nMost of the time, Sourcegraph site admins will monitor and query key metrics through Grafana, rather than through Prometheus directly. Grafana also provides the dashboards that monitor the standard metrics that indicate the health of the instance. Follow the instructions below to access Prometheus directly instead.\n\nIf you are using the Kubernetes deployment option, port-forward the Prometheus service:\n\nIf you are using Docker Single Container or the Docker Compose deployment option, you will need to restart the Sourcegraph container with a flag --publish 9090:9090 in the docker run command.\n\nPrometheus will be available http://localhost:9090.\n\nUsing a custom monitoring system",
      "# [SMTP and email delivery](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/config/email)\nSourcegraph uses an SMTP server of your choosing to send emails for:\n\nCode Monitoring notifications\n\nInviting other users to a Sourcegraph instance, or to an organization/team on a Sourcegraph instance\n\nImportant updates to a user accounts (for example, creation of API keys)\n\nFor builtin authentication, password resets and email verification\n\nNOTE: Sourcegraph Cloud customers can take advantage of mananged SMTP servers - learn more.\n\nUser email verification\n\nMany emails delivered from a Sourcegraph instance to a user requires that the user's primary email address be verified. This helps prevent Sourcegraph from sending product emails to invalid or inactive email addresses.\n\nUsers that create accounts through an external authentication provider, such as GitHub or SAML, will automatically have verified email addresses from the external provider.\n\nWhen SMTP is configured, users that sign up through builtin authentication will have the emails they sign up with marked as unverified. To verify their email address, the user can do one of the following:\n\nClick the \"set password\" link they receive in their email\n\nIn the \"Emails\" tab of their account, click \"Send verification email\"\n\nAsk a site admin to verify their email manually through the \"Emails\" tab of their account, or through the setUserEmailVerified GraphQL mutation\n\nUsers with emails created by the site admin through the /site-admin/users/new UI will have the same behaviour as the above. Users created directly through GraphQL or the src CLI assume that the email provided is verified.\n\nNote: For SSO (Single Sign-On) enabled instances, it is important to remove the basic authentication method from the auth.providers list to prevent users from receiving password reset links. This is because users do not need passwords to log in to SSO-enabled instances. Prior to disabling the basic authentication method, please ensure that there is at least one administrator account capable of signing in via SSO. This is essential because once basic authentication is disabled, the username/password combination used to create the initial admin account will no longer be functional.\n\nConfiguring Sourcegraph to send email via Amazon AWS / SES\n\nTo use Amazon SES with Sourcegraph, first follow these steps to create an SES account for Sourcegraph.\n\nNavigate to your site configuration (e.g. https://sourcegraph.com/site-admin/configuration) and fill in the configuration:\n\nPlease note that the configured email.address (the from address) must be a verified address with SES, see this page for details.\n\nSend a test email to verify it is configured properly.\n\nConfiguring Sourcegraph to send email via Google Workspace / GMail\n\nTo use Google Workspace with Sourcegraph, you will need to create an SMTP Relay account. Be sure to choose Require SMTP Authentication and Require TLS encryption in step 7.\n\nNavigate to your site configuration (e.g. https://sourcegraph.com/site-admin/configuration) and fill in the configuration:\n\nMake sure that [email protected] in both places of the configuration matches the email address of the account you created, and that <YOUR SECRET> is replaced with the account password or app password when 2FA enabled.\n\nSend a test email to verify it is configured properly.\n\nConfiguring Sourcegraph to send email using another provider\n\nOther providers such as Mailchimp and Sendgrid may also be used with Sourcegraph. Any valid SMTP server account should do. For those two providers in specific, you may follow their documentation:\n\nhttps://mailchimp.com/developer/transactional/docs/smtp-integration/\n\nhttps://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/getting-started-smtp\n\nOnce you have an SMTP account, simply navigate to your site configuration (e.g. https://sourcegraph.com/site-admin/configuration) and fill in the configuration:\n\nA few helpful tips:\n\nemail.address is the email Sourcegraph will send email FROM. Make sure your account has privilege to send mail from that address.\n\nYou should use a TLS/SSL enabled port, either 587 or 2525. Any port number is allowed, though.\n\nThe following authentication types are allowed: PLAIN (default), CRAM-MD5, and none\n\nIf a HELO domain is required, simply add \"domain\": \"<the domain>\", under email.smtp\n\nTLS certificate verification can be disabled if your SMTP server does not have a valid TLS cert. To do so, set \"noVerifyTLS\": true, (this is not recommended and may be a security risk)\n\nSend a test email to verify it is configured properly.\n\nSending a test email\n\n(Added in Sourcegraph v3.38)\n\nTo verify email sending is working correctly, visit the GraphQL API console at e.g. https://sourcegraph.example.com/api/console and then run the following query replacing [email protected] with your personal email address:\n\nIf everything is successfully configured, you should see a response like:\n\nOtherwise, you should see an error with more information:",
      "# [Sourcegraph docs](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/observability/logs)\nLogs\n\nThis document describes the log output from Sourcegraph services and how to configure it.\n\nNote: For request logs, see Outbound request log.\n\nLog levels\n\nA Sourcegraph service's log level is configured via the environment variable SRC_LOG_LEVEL. The valid values (from most to least verbose) are:\n\ndbug: Debug. Output all logs. Default in cluster deployments.\n\ninfo: Informational.\n\nwarn: Warning. Default in Docker deployments.\n\neror: Error.\n\ncrit: Critical.\n\nLearn more about how to apply these environment variables in docker-compose and server deployments.\n\nLog format\n\nA Sourcegraph service's log output format is configured via the environment variable SRC_LOG_FORMAT. The valid values are:\n\ncondensed: Optimized for human readability.\n\njson: Machine-readable JSON format.\n\nFor certain services and log entries, Sourcegraph exports a OpenTelemetry-compliant log data model.\n\njson_gcp: Machine-readable JSON format, tailored to GCP cloud-logging expected structure.\n\nlogfmt: The logfmt format.\n\nNote that logfmt is no longer supported with Sourcegraph's new internal logging standards - if you need structured logs, we recommend using json instead. If set to logfmt, log output from new loggers will be in condensed format.\n\nOpenTelemetry\n\nWhen configured to export JSON logs, Sourcegraph services that have migrated to the new internal logging standard that will export a JSON log format compliant with OpenTelemetry's log data model:\n\nWe also include the following non-OpenTelemetry fields:\n\nLog level overrides\n\nA Sourcegraph service's log level can be configured for a specific InstrumentationScope and it's children. For example you can keep your log level at error, but turn on debug logs for a specific component. This is only used to increase verbosity. IE it can't be used to mute a scope.\n\nThis is configured by the environment variable SRC_LOG_SCOPE_LEVEL. It has the format SCOPE_0=LEVEL_0,SCOPE_1=LEVEL_1,.... For example to turn on debug logs for service.UpdateScheduler and repoPurgeWorker you would set the following on the repo-updater service:\n\nNote that this will also affect child scopes. So in the example you will also receive debug logs from service.UpdateScheduler.RunUpdateLoop.\n\nLog sampling\n\nSourcegraph services that have migrated to the new internal logging standard have log sampling enabled by default. The first 100 identical log entries per second will always be output, but thereafter only every 100th identical message will be output.\n\nThis behaviour can be configured for each service using the following environment variables:\n\nSRC_LOG_SAMPLING_INITIAL: the number of entries with identical messages to always output per second\n\nSRC_LOG_SAMPLING_THEREAFTER: the number of entries with identical messages to discard before emitting another one per second, after SRC_LOG_SAMPLING_INITIAL.",

      "# [Scaling Overview for Services](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/deploy/scale)\nThis page provides a comprehensive overview of how each Sourcegraph service scales. In order to support the growth of your instance usage, it is recommended to scale Sourcegraph based on the scaling factors suggested below.\n\nGrafana should be the first stop you make if you plan to expand on one of the scaling factors or when you are experiencing a system performance issue.\n\nPlease use the following scaling guideline for services that are using more than 80% of their assigned resources.\n\nScaling is unnecessary if your resource usage is kept below 80%.\n\nFor example, if you plan to add 100% more engaged users, and the resource usage for all services is currently at around 70%, we’d recommend using this documentation as a reference to adjust the resources that list “Number of active users” as one of their scaling factors. You can also use the output from the Resource Estimator as references alternatively.\n\nFor assistance when scaling and tuning Sourcegraph, contact us. We're happy to help!\n\nComponents Overview\n\nHere is a list of components you can find in a typical Sourcegraph deployment:\n\nCore Components\n\nfrontendServes the web application, extensions, and graphQL services. Almost every service has a link back to the frontend, from which it gathers configuration updates.gitserverMirrors repositories from their code host. All other Sourcegraph services talk to gitserver when they need data from git.precise-code-intelConverts LSIF upload file into Postgres data. The entire index must be read into memory to be correlated.repo-updaterTracks the state of repositories. It is responsible for automatically scheduling updates using gitserver and for synchronizing metadata between code hosts and external services.searcherProvides on-demand un-indexed search for repositories. It fetches archives from gitserver and searches them with regexp.symbolsIndexes symbols in repositories using Ctags.syntect-serverAn HTTP server that exposes the Rust Syntect syntax highlighting library for use by other services.workerRuns a collection of background jobs periodically in response to internal requests and external events. It is currently janitorial and commit based.zoekt-indexserverIndexes all enabled repositories on Sourcegraph and keeps the indexes up to date. Lives inside the indexed-search pod in a Kubernetes deployment.zoekt-webserverRuns searches from indexes stored in memory and disk. The indexes are persisted to disk to avoid re-indexing on startup. Lives inside the indexed-search pod in a Kubernetes deployment.\n\nExternal Services\n\nA list of services that can be externalized. See our docs on Using external services with Sourcegraph for detailed instruction.\n\ncodeinsights-dbA PostgreSQL instance for storing code insights data.codeintel-dbA PostgreSQL instance for storing large-volume code graph data.jaegerA Jaeger instance for end-to-end distributed tracing.blobstoreA blobstore instance that serves as a local S3-compatible object storage to hold user uploads for code-intel before they can be processed.pgsqlA PostgreSQL instance for storing long-term information, such as user information when using Sourcegraph’s built-in authentication provider instead of an external one.redis-cacheA Redis instance for storing cache data.redis-storeA Redis instance for storing short-term information such as user sessions.\n\nSourcegraph provides a number of tools to monitor the health and usage of your deployment. See our Observability docs for more information.

      "# [Viewing Code Insights](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/code_insights/explanations/viewing_code_insights)\nInsights dashboards\n\nThe main way to view code insights is on a dashboard page. Dashboards have a unique name and visibility level.\n\nThere are three possible visibility levels:\n\nPrivate: visible only to you\n\nShared with an organization: visible to everyone in the organization\n\nGlobal: visible to everyone on the Sourcegraph instance\n\nYou can share links to individual insights by clicking the three-dots context menu on an insight and selecting the shareable link.\n\nIn order to share a code insight with someone else, the insight must already be on a dashboard visible to them: either a global or organization's dashboard.\n\nThe share link box will indicate which other users will be able to view the insight, or if the insight is private and must first be added to a more public dashboard in order to share it.\n\nBuilt-in dashboards\n\nA default \"dashboard\" of all insights visible to a user appears as the homepage for the Insights navigation bar item.\n\nTo add insights to your own custom dashboard, see Creating a custom dashboard of code insights.\n\nDashboard visibility\n\nA Dashboard's visibility level owns the visibility of code insights on the dashboard. If you add an Insight that was on a private dashboard to an organization or global dashboard, now people with access to that dashboard can view the insight. When you first create an insight, it defaults to appearing on the dashboard from which you clicked the \"create\" button, and inherits that original dashboard's permissions. Everyone who can access an insight to view it can also edit it.\n\nIf you create an insight directly on the create page or from the default dashboard, it will appear on the default dashboard and default to \"private\" permissions. There's one exception: if the instance has no code insights license, then private dashboards and insights are disallowed, and all limited access mode insights are global.\n\nInsights still enforce individual permissions regardless of dashboard visibility\n\nThe dashboard visibility levels have no impact on the data in the insight itself that is displayed to an individual user: insights enforce the viewer's permissions.\n\nThis means that two organization users with different repo read permission sets might see different values for the same insights on the same dashboards, if it contains results from a repository only one user can view.\n\nIf you change a private-visible dashboard so that the dashboard is now visible to an organization (or globally), then the organization (or entire instance) can now see all insights on the dashboard, though the result counts will still be filtered to count from only repos that the individual organization member can view.\n\nInsights can be on multiple dashboards\n\nYou can attach insights to multiple dashboards.",

      "# [Adding precise code navigation to CI/CD workflows](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/code-search/code-navigation/how-to/adding_lsif_to_workflows)\nLanguage-specific guides\n\nWe are working on creating language specific guides for use with different indexers, so make sure to check for the documentation for your language! If there isn't a guide for your language, this general guide will help you through the precise code navigation setup process.\n\nBenefits of CI integration\n\nSetting up a source code indexing job in your CI build provides you with fast code navigation that gives you more control on when source code gets indexed, and ensures accuracy of your code navigation by keeping in sync with changes in your repository. Due to the large number of CI frameworks and languages we may not have specific documentation for your use case. Feel free to file an issue if you're having difficulties and we can help troubleshoot your setup.\n\nUsing indexer containers\n\nWe're working on creating containers that bundle indexers and the Sourcegraph CLI (src). All the languages in our language-specific guides are supported, and this section provides a general guide to using those containers. We've pinned the containers to the latest tag in these samples so they stay up to date, but make sure you pin them before going live to ensure reproducibility.\n\nBasic usage\n\nSome indexers will work out of the box by just running them in your project root. Here's an example using GitHub actions and Go:\n\nSub-projects\n\nIf your repository contains multiple code projects in different folders, your CI framework likely provides a \"working directory\" option so that you can do something like:\n\nCustom build environments\n\nDepending on which language you're using, you may need to perform some pre-indexing steps in a custom build environment. You have a couple options for this:\n\nAdd the indexer and Sourcegraph CLI (src) to your environment. To make this easier, you could either directly build a Docker image from our indexer container, or use its Dockerfile as inspiration for getting the tools installed in your environment.\n\nDo the pre-indexing steps in your environment, and then make those artifacts available to our container.\n\nThis second step is easy in GitHub actions because our container can be used as an action. Here's an example for a TypeScript project:\n\nGitHub Action Examples\n\nThe following projects have example GitHub Action workflows to generate and upload indexes.\n\nelastic/kibana\n\ngolang/go\n\nkubernetes/kubernetes\n\nlodash/lodash\n\nmoby/moby\n\nReactiveX/IxJS\n\nCircle CI Examples\n\nCertain frameworks like Circle CI may require you to explicitly cache artifacts between jobs. In CircleCI this might look like the following:\n\nThe following projects have example CircleCI configurations to generate and upload indexes.\n\nangular/angular\n\nfacebook/jest\n\nfacebook/react\n\ngrafana\n\nhelm\n\nprometheus/prometheus\n\nReactiveX/rxjs\n\nTravis CI Examples\n\nThe following projects have example Travis CI configurations to generate and upload indexes.\n\naws/aws-sdk-go\n\netcd-io/etcd\n\nexpressjs/express\n\nhugo/hugo\n\nMicrosoft/TypeScript\n\nmoment/moment\n\nsindresorhus/got\n\nCI from scratch\n\nIf you're indexing a language we haven't documented yet in our language-specific guides, follow the instructions in this section. We want to have containers available for every language with a robust indexer, so please also consider filing an issue to let us know we're missing one.\n\nSet up your CI machines\n\nYour CI machines will need two command-line tools installed. Depending on your build system setup, you can do this as part of the CI step, or you can add it directly to your CI machines for use by the build.\n\nThe Sourcegraph CLI (src).\n\nThe indexer for your language.\n\nAdd steps to your CI\n\nGenerate an index for a project within your repository by running the indexer in the project directory (consult your indexer's docs).\n\nUpload that generated index to your Sourcegraph instance.\n\nRecommended upload frequency\n\nWe recommend that you start with a CI job that runs on every commit (including branches).\n\nIf you see too much load on your CI, your Sourcegraph instance, or a rapid decrease in free disk space on your Sourcegraph instance, you can instead index only the default branch, or set up a periodic job (e.g. daily) in CI that indexes your default branch.\n\nWith periodic jobs, you should still receive precise code navigation on non-indexed commits on lines that are unchanged since the nearest indexed commit. This requires that the indexed commit be a direct ancestor or descendant no more than 100 commits away. If your commit frequency is too high and your index frequency is too low, you may find commits with no precise code navigation at all. In this case, we recommend you try to increase your index frequency if possible.\n\nUploading indexes to Sourcegraph.com\n\nIndexes can be uploaded to a self-hosted Sourcegraph instance or to Sourcegraph.com. Using the Sourcegraph.com endpoint will surface code navigation for your public repositories directly on GitHub via the Sourcegraph browser extension and at https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>."

      "# Post ID 1c659cl: Has anyone tried using Sourcegraph's SCIP to develop a language server? with +3 score by [(son_of_Gib, Reddit, 2024-04-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/1c659cl/has_anyone_tried_using_sourcegraphs_scip_to/)\nI'm trying to develop platform independent language servers for my coding copilot so i don't have to depend on vscode's default language server APIs. I've tried using tree-sitter to find references, go to definition, and they work to an extent but fails with variable references and cannot differentiate constructors and functions. I did some research (idk if i did enough but I'm exhausted at not finding a solution) and found [SCIP](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/announcing-scip). Its an alternative to LSIF but I have no idea how to use it. It has a Protobuf schema explaining the way it creates the index.scip file that contains all the basic symbol information like references and definition but i have no idea how to even extract this information and use it. \n\nI'm a student doing this as a project and i really hit a roadblock here. Would really appreciate some help on this.\n\nAlso, are there any open-source language servers that i can use?\n\n## Comment ID l00pz1p with +6 score by [(olafurpg, Reddit, 2024-04-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/1c659cl/has_anyone_tried_using_sourcegraphs_scip_to/l00pz1p/) (in reply to ID 1c659cl):\nAuthor of SCIP here. I’m sorry if this comment is a bit all over the place, I’m sitting in my kids room waiting for my 8wo twins to fall asleep. \n\nIt’s true that there are no high level guides on how to extract or work with SCIP. It takes a bit of practice to work with the data, understand how to process symbols and run all of this efficiently. If you overcome this barrier, it opens up a ton of doors for building useful language agnostic developer tooling.\n\nSCIP standalone is not sufficient to implement a language server but it can be a helpful component of a language server. The Scala language server, Metals, uses SemanticDB which is effectively the same thing as SCIP. You can take a look at the Metals codebase for inspiration if you’re familiar with Scala. For example, here’s one blog post explaining the approach to implement fast “find references” with SemanticDB symbols http://scalameta.org/metals/blog/2019/01/22/bloom-filters.\n\nMetals uses heavily the Scala presentation compiler to support low-latency interactions that wouldn’t be possible with a batch indexer like the SCIP indexers you’ve seen. However, deep inside the interactions with the presentation compiler, Metals converts compiler symbols into SemanticDB symbol to lookup stuff from an index (generated by batch indexers). If you’re building a non-trivial application with SCIP then it’s inevitable that you’ll end up using tricks like that.\n\nEvery developer tool ends up having different needs (performance, language coverage, features, memory usage, disk footprint, runtime, …) making it difficult to support off-the-shelf library APIs to work with SCIP data. The total number of devtools authors who are interested in using this data is also so small making it difficult to justify the investment in providing off-the-shelf solutions.\n\n### Comment ID l09dyfr with +3 score by [(son_of_Gib, Reddit, 2024-04-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/1c659cl/has_anyone_tried_using_sourcegraphs_scip_to/l09dyfr/) (in reply to ID l00pz1p):\nCongrats on the twins!!\n\nAlso I've never worked on Scala but this is an interesting read. The Scala presentation compiler seems interesting though I'd have to take a good amount of time to really understand what's going on there. \n\nThanks for your reply this was really very helpful!\n\nEdit: Also thank you for working on SCIP!

And every single symbol (variable name, method/fn name, class name, constant, etc.) is linked to all references to that symbol. So e.g. you can just click any class or method and see every single usage of that class or method or constant across the entire codebase (every single google project, every single dependency, every single language, etc....). Its also tied in with our build system (internally called blaze or externally called bazel), so you can e.g. load proto file in the browser and then see all generated sources from that file (like the Java, js, c++, or python class from protoc) even though they don't actually exist on disk.\n\nMostly it's the search that is amazing, e.g.\n\nhttps://cs.opensource.google/search?q=lang:java%20OutputStream%20-f:Test%20&ss=protobuf%2Fprotobuf\n\nCode search exposes predicates that show understandings of the language. e.g. you can avoid matching string in a code comment but using the \"usage:\" predicate.\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/code-search/reference\n\nThe tools scale so that a single project can easily have thousands of files and large teams (100s of SWEs) can remotely collaborate efficiently.\n\nWe also have our code review tool, internally called critique. That exposes it's own search indices for searching all (un)submitted changes, e.g. search all changes from Jan 1 to Feb 3, on files matching .*Foo.java, with change text \"bar\", under path a/b/c. This really helps bisecting regressions.\n\nHonestly, the tooling makes me 10x more efficient than I am otherwise on my own.\n\n## Comment ID i01in3p with +1 score by [(quetejodas, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i01in3p/) (in reply to ID tahdd2):\nAgent Ransack\n\n## Comment ID i01m72n with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i01m72n/) (in reply to ID tahdd2):\nMost of it I do in VSCode and IDE but sometimes I use Meld for change detection and the good old `find -iname` plus a ton of either bash or half-baked Python.\n\n## Comment ID i01n3ws with +1 score by [(Isvara, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i01n3ws/) (in reply to ID tahdd2):\nhttps://elixir.bootlin.com/\n\n## Comment ID i01xvoc with +1 score by [(pancakeQueue, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i01xvoc/) (in reply to ID tahdd2):\nThe VSCode extension GitLens is fantastic.

      "# Post ID 1ftt6sf: Sourcebot, an open-source Sourcegraph alternative with +59 score by [(lowpolydreaming, Reddit, 2024-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1ftt6sf/sourcebot_an_opensource_sourcegraph_alternative/)\nHi, we’re Brendan and Michael, the creators of Sourcebot ([https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot)). Sourcebot is an open-source code search tool that allows you to quickly search across many large codebases. Check out our demo video here: [https://youtu.be/mrIFYSB\\_1F4](https://youtu.be/mrIFYSB_1F4), or try it for yourself here on our demo site: [https://demo.sourcebot.dev](https://demo.sourcebot.dev)\n\nWhile at prior roles, we’ve both felt the pain of searching across hundreds of multi-million line codebases. Using local tools like grep were ill-suited since you often only had a handful of codebases checked out at a time. [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/) solves this issue by indexing a collection of codebases in the background and exposing a web-based search interface. It is the de-facto search solution for medium to large orgs, but is often cited as expensive ($49 per user / month) and recently went [closed source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41296481). That’s why we built Sourcebot.\n\nWe designed Sourcebot to be:\n\n* **Easily deployed:** we provide a single, self-contained [Docker image](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/pkgs/container/sourcebot).\n* **Fast & scalable:** designed to minimize search times (current average is \\~73ms) across many large repositories.\n* **Cross code-host support:** we currently support syncing public & private repositories in GitHub and GitLab.\n* **Quality UI:** we like to think that a good looking dev-tool is more pleasant to use.\n* **Open source:** Sourcebot is free to use by anyone.\n\nUnder the hood, we use [Zoekt](https://github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt) as our code search engine, which was originally authored by Han-Wen Nienhuys and now [maintained by Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/sourcegraph-accepting-zoekt-maintainership). Zoekt works by building a trigram index from the source code enabling extremely fast regular expression matching. Russ Cox has a great [article](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html) on how trigram indexes work if you’re interested.\n\nIn the shorter-term, there are several improvements we want to make, like:\n\n* Improving how we communicate indexing progress (this is currently non-existent so it’s not obvious how long things will take)\n* UX improvements like search history, query syntax highlighting & suggestions, etc.\n* Small QOL improvements like bookmarking code snippets.\n* Support for more code hosts (e.g., BitBucket, SourceForge, ADO, etc.)\n\nIn the longer-term, we want to investigate how we could go beyond just traditional code search by leveraging machine learning to enable experiences like semantic code search (“where is system X located?”) and code explanations (”how does system X interact with system Y?”). You could think of this as a copilot being embedded into Sourcebot. Our hunch is that will be useful to devs, especially when packaged with the traditional code search, but let us know what you think.\n\nGive it a try: [https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot).

The last interview I had with them was pretty conversational.  I had a background in some of the problems they were working on and during the conversation I brought up a sort of improvement/trick I had figured out in the past and the interviewer said it was something they had never considered before and seemed really interested in it which I thought was a good sign.  But unfortunately they ghosted me after that.  But here's the crazy part.  Sourcegraph has some open source repos and out of curiosity I decided to look at one the other day.  I looked at a few of the recent PRs and one of them caught my eye.  The PR was the EXACT improvement/trick that I brought up in my interview.  I look at who created the PR and, of course, it was the guy who interviewed me.  I looked at the date and it was about a week after my interview happened.  So this place ghosted me AND used me for free consulting.  I'm actually kind of flattered.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID kpezshb with +723 score by [(reformedlion, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1aliiqb/name_shame_sourcegraph/kpezshb/) (in reply to ID 1aliiqb):\nI bet he went into a meeting and said “I just thought of something…”\n\n### Comment ID kphndxc with +74 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1aliiqb/name_shame_sourcegraph/kphndxc/) (in reply to ID kpezshb):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID kphoezy with +39 score by [(Used-Routine-4461, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1aliiqb/name_shame_sourcegraph/kphoezy/) (in reply to ID kphndxc):\n100% do this, plagiarism is not cool.\n\n## Comment ID kpf6ylt with +362 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1aliiqb/name_shame_sourcegraph/kpf6ylt/) (in reply to ID 1aliiqb):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID kpf8y1g with +214 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1aliiqb/name_shame_sourcegraph/kpf8y1g/) (in reply to ID kpf6ylt):\n[removed]\n\n#### Comment ID kpfa66b with +140 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1aliiqb/name_shame_sourcegraph/kpfa66b/) (in reply to ID kpf8y1g):\n[removed]\n\n#### Comment ID kpffmev with +29 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1aliiqb/name_shame_sourcegraph/kpffmev/) (in reply to ID kpf8y1g):\n[removed]\n\n#### Comment ID kpfdak9 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1aliiqb/name_shame_sourcegraph/kpfdak9/) (in reply to ID kpf8y1g):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID kpfd504 with +24 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1aliiqb/name_shame_sourcegraph/kpfd504/) (in reply to ID kpf6ylt):\n[removed]\n\n## Comment ID kpfb94g with +153 score by [(FitGas7951, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1aliiqb/name_shame_sourcegraph/kpfb94g/) (in reply to ID 1aliiqb):\nInterview NDAs are written to shield the company in exactly this kind of situation.\n\nPS: Since there are doubters, here's a sample from an interview NDA that I happen to have.\n\n>Candidate is under **no obligation to give Company any ideas, suggestions, comments or other feedback** related to Company's business or operations.

      "# Post ID 1fttd8r: Sourcebot, an open-source Sourcegraph alternative with +20 score by [(lowpolydreaming, Reddit, 2024-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/freesoftware/comments/1fttd8r/sourcebot_an_opensource_sourcegraph_alternative/)\nHi! We’re Brendan and Michael, the creators of Sourcebot ([https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot)). Sourcebot is an open-source code search tool that allows you to quickly search across many large codebases. Check out our demo video here: [https://youtu.be/mrIFYSB\\_1F4](https://youtu.be/mrIFYSB_1F4), or try it for yourself here on our demo site: [https://demo.sourcebot.dev](https://demo.sourcebot.dev)\n\nWhile at prior roles, we’ve both felt the pain of searching across hundreds of multi-million line codebases. Using local tools like grep were ill-suited since you often only had a handful of codebases checked out at a time. [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/) solves this issue by indexing a collection of codebases in the background and exposing a web-based search interface. It is the de-facto search solution for medium to large orgs, but is often cited as expensive ($49 per user / month) and recently went [closed source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41296481). That’s why we built Sourcebot.\n\nWe designed Sourcebot to be:\n\n* **Easily deployed:** we provide a single, self-contained [Docker image](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/pkgs/container/sourcebot).\n* **Fast & scalable:** designed to minimize search times (current average is \\~73ms) across many large repositories.\n* **Cross code-host support:** we currently support syncing public & private repositories in GitHub and GitLab.\n* **Quality UI:** we like to think that a good looking dev-tool is more pleasant to use.\n* **Open source:** Sourcebot is free to use by anyone.\n\nUnder the hood, we use [Zoekt](https://github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt) as our code search engine, which was originally authored by Han-Wen Nienhuys and now [maintained by Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/sourcegraph-accepting-zoekt-maintainership). Zoekt works by building a trigram index from the source code enabling extremely fast regular expression matching. Russ Cox has a great [article](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html) on how trigram indexes work if you’re interested.\n\nIn the shorter-term, there are several improvements we want to make, like:\n\n* Improving how we communicate indexing progress (this is currently non-existent so it’s not obvious how long things will take)\n* UX improvements like search history, query syntax highlighting & suggestions, etc.\n* Small QOL improvements like bookmarking code snippets.\n* Support for more code hosts (e.g., BitBucket, SourceForge, ADO, etc.)\n\nIn the longer-term, we want to investigate how we could go beyond just traditional code search by leveraging machine learning to enable experiences like semantic code search (“where is system X located?”) and code explanations (”how does system X interact with system Y?”). You could think of this as a copilot being embedded into Sourcebot. Our hunch is that will be useful to devs, especially when packaged with the traditional code search, but let us know what you think.\n\nGive it a try: [https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot).

It basically just uses sourceboxes (https://sourcegraph.com/blog/sourceboxes-a-better-way-to-embed-code-snippets) to embed the clickable/tooltipped code snippets, and it links to Sourcegraph to show usage examples. (There's not much code to open source.)\n* I'd love to integrate this functionality into gddo (the code that powers godoc.org), but I assume it'd be rejected since it'd introduce a dependency on an external API.

      "# Post ID 1eou6cj: Claude Project vs Cody? with +0 score by [(Fancy_Ad_4809, Reddit, 2024-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1eou6cj/claude_project_vs_cody/)\nI'm curious if anyone here has used both Claude Projects and SourceGraph Cody.\n\nI've been using the Cody extension in VsCode for both programming and a little fiction writing.  Cody (from Sourcegraph) provides an interface that let's you choose from any of 3.5 Sonnet (default), 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4o and Mixtral 8x22B among others. You can freely switch among them on a prompt by prompt basis.\n\nThe interface supports chats, inline prompting, and autocomplete suggestions. About the only downside I've encountered so far is that it limits the conversation context to 15K tokens + 45K tokens from source files you reference with the prompt and the output is limited to 4k tokens per query.\n\nI got curious about Claude Projects after running into those limits in a very long chat with 3.5 Sonnet. Cody is clever about windowing the chat, I only discovered it when asking Sonnet to fill in some specific details in a summary outline of the chat and it admitted it no longer had access to them.  Other than that, 3.5 Sonnet + Cody + VSCode has been truly transformative for my projects - and it's only $9 per month.\n\nSo for very long chats, I'm just now experimenting with Projects. I'm wondering what it can do better than Cody to justify continuing my $20/month subscription.\n\n(note: I have absolutely no personal or financial affiliation with either product)\n\n## Comment ID lhfzl03 with +12 score by [(pegunless, Reddit, 2024-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1eou6cj/claude_project_vs_cody/lhfzl03/) (in reply to ID 1eou6cj):\nSourcegraph marketing folks are getting pretty shameless with the advertising here.

I use Cody when I reach my limit on the Claude Pro. In general I've found Claude Pro is more willing to offer extensive answers and to work hard. Cody seems to be programmed to keep it brief (which is understandable as they are paying for the expensive API). So, when I use Cody I find myself focusing on smaller tasks, and I have the big thinking and broader coding talks for Claude Pro. I do use Claude Sonnet 3.5 through Cody, so I still find it very intelligent and capable, just not as willing to do long outputs or deeper thinking.",

So you mentioned when you created ripgrep, you didn't really go into it wanting to make a grep competitor, an alternative to grep. You started with the regular expression engine, and then you wrote this thing as a way to kind of benchmark that engine and it turned out to be performant, competitive with all the other solutions?\n> \n> **Andrew:** Yeah.\n> \n> **Beyang:** I guess at what point did you say like, \"Okay, I'm going to actually invest in making this into a really neat command line tool that I myself am going to use day to day.\"\n> \n> **Andrew:** That's a good question. I don't know if there was a specific cut over point where I said that to myself. I mean, I guess there had to have been. But I think really, it was just a matter of, \"Hey, this is competitive in a lot of cases.\" Not just in some of the cases that I had expected that it might be or maybe didn't even believe that it would be. Because at the time I kind of had the same impression about GNU grep's speed as everyone else. And I say that with, there's two well known articles that are gone around the internet for a long time.

          "cons": "There was a big layoff in mid 2022, and since then, this place has been on a rapid decline. DEI was done away with quickly, and benefits began getting pulled left and right. Since then, there has been no sense of safety or longevity. You clock in each day with the idea that it could be your last.\n\nThe smartest leaders were shown the door, and the ones that kept their jobs were the loyalists to the exec suite's ideas, no matter how weak or deranged. The exec suite thought it was a good idea to change what we sold and for how much every few months, then berated teams for not hitting quota (which was next to impossible when there was no direction). \n\nThis environment quickly spiraled in to the Hunger Games. Exec meetings became tense and the ICs felt the trickle down as managers threw their own people under the bus. The calibration cycle almost a year ago was incredibly brutal, built solely on an agenda to make as many top performers quit as possible to save some cash. \n\nWhat used to make this place worthwhile (location-agnostic pay, work-life balance) doesn't exist anymore. Instead, you'll join a company that gets off on backstabbing, steamrolling, and punishment. The bad managers do nothing but gaslight and indulge in toxicity with their direct reports. They play favorites and if you're not in the \"in\" club, you'll be shown the pink slip soon enough. The ones that \"succeed\" here are the \"yes\" men (and yes, it is mostly men since DEI isn't a priority anymore) and the ones that are willing to put their health, mental state, and/or personal life on the line in order to get ahead for a company that will quickly lose the AI race to any number of stronger giants. Working late nights and weekends is the rule, not the exception, but they'll lead with their \"work from anywhere\" culture in interviews to make it seem reasonable. \n\nIt does not matter if you've been successful at Sourcegraph or have hit your goals consistently quarter after quarter. If they decide that they don't like you, you'll be gaslit, punished, and eventually pushed to leave.\n\nThey hire some of the smartest people that I've ever met, but they abuse them to the point that the best friends I made at Sourcegraph were due to trauma bonding together.",

While your GitHub commit rate is impressive, delegating this task to your development team might be more beneficial. With the company at a crucial stage, your time and expertise could be more impactful in addressing strategic issues and steering the company towards success.\n\nFor the CTO: The key to great software development lies in a strong, well-supported team. Reflecting on the consistent feedback in these reviews could be enlightening. This introspection may help fine-tune your leadership approach, enhancing team dynamics and contributing positively to Sourcegraph’s trajectory.\n\nTo the ever-evolving leadership team at Sourcegraph: As you navigate your new roles, be mindful that job security has been a recurring challenge within the company. It's crucial not to take any outcomes personally. Numerous highly skilled predecessors have faced similar situations. Stay positive but honest, give it your best, and remember that the outcome is more about the company's ongoing dynamics than a measure of your individual talents. Wishing you the best of luck in your endeavors.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "I wanted to share some real talk about my time at Sourcegraph, especially since you might be considering a role there. It's always good to go in with both eyes open, right?\n\nThe work environment at Sourcegraph isn't just a mixed bag; it presents considerable challenges. They've made a strategic pivot recently, but that's only part of the story. The leadership team has been completely overhauled multiple times in just two years. It's tough to have any confidence in the longevity of the current leadership when you've seen their predecessors shown the door one after the other. Initially, these changes brought a sense of hope, but by the third round, it's hard not to feel a bit sorry for the new leaders who are trying their best - just like the last ones did.\n\nRegarding the executive team, to put it simply, they lack experience. There's a palpable sense of internal strife, almost like they're participants in their own version of the Hunger Games, each afraid of being the next to go. This atmosphere of uncertainty doesn't lead to outright micromanagement, but something perhaps more frustrating. Often, you'll receive vague directives like \"make it better\" without clear guidance on what that actually means. If you dare to ask for clarification, you risk being labeled as entitled. And remember, how you interpret and act on these vague instructions will come back around in your impact reviews, which I'll get into a bit more later.\n\nJob security is a significant concern. Layoffs have become a recurring theme, not just an occasional blip. It's happened several times over the last two years alone. With the management structure in constant flux, you never really feel settled. It's like standing on shifting sands, always unsure of where you stand or who you'll report to next or if they will even be left around by the next review cycle.\n\nNow, let's talk about the impact reviews. Sourcegraph has been around for a decade, so they're far from a startup. The real issue is that they're struggling to find a way to significantly increase revenue to finally IPO. The CEO and CTO seem to be out of fresh ideas, so there's this pressure on employees to come up with million-dollar ideas - or to “make it better” 😉. If you don't come up with something that substantially boosts the bottom line, you're labeled as not making an impact, putting you at risk of being in the next round of layoffs which always seem to be just around the corner. Even if you do come up with a great idea, it gets absorbed by the top brass, and then it's back to square one - you need another big idea, increase your commit rate (which gets judged at impact reviews) or go back to helping endless new hires, new management, and customer success team navigate a tech stack that's been left hollow by the departure of the many skilled devs that owned them but have left due to layoffs or attrition and hope that they perceive those efforts as impactful.\n\nIn short, while there are some perks like fair pay, the overall environment is fraught with peril, from unstable leadership and job insecurity to a high-pressure culture around million dollar feature ideas. It's a lot to take on, and I just wanted you to know what you might be getting into.\n\nWishing you the best in your job search and career. Take care!",

The team across the board is full of self-starters who aren't afraid to share their ideas, and the lack of red tape means things get done quickly. Even though the past year has been insanely tough for mostly everyone in tech (and the exec team undoubtedly had to make some extremely hard decisions that they told us about with as much transparency as possible at every step), I have no doubt that Sourcegraph is going to come out on top. I've personally learned and grown more here than anywhere else I've worked before, and I couldn't be happier. If you're up for a challenge and want to be a part of something special, then Sourcegraph is definitely a place that I'd recommend.",

Leadership called this ask \"entitlement\", others might call it the development lifecycle. - The DEI policy was removed as it was seen as \"divisive\". \"Equal opportunity\" took its place. ERG groups were told to not meet on company time or use company resources. - Favoritism abounds. The people who worked 70+ hour weeks are who were praised, awarded, saved from layoffs. I saw many get demotions for seemingly no reason in my time there. - So much cursing. Leadership curses fervently in big group meetings. Maybe they think it's cool and startup-y?

          "cons": "Sourcegraph, a decade old company, has regressed to pre-product market fit after a recent strategic and product pivot. The new flagship product lacks significant differentiated from an equivalent Microsoft product with greater distribution and comparatively infinite runway.\n\nThe majority (if not all) of the exec team is working in their largest role, and those making decisions have very little experience working in teams they do not control with absolute power. Execs have opposing goals for the company and have continuously failed to build a team that they can or are willing to place their trust in. They will micromanage down to the IC level, and spend focus on controlling things like \"woke DEI culture\" at the expense of addressing key business challenges.\n\nCommunication is majorly problematic. PeopleOps and Communications teams find themselves frequently deleting or damage-controlling messages from executives. These messages undermine morale (sometimes punching-down to particular ICs) and create unnecessary panic, sometimes involving self-aggrandizing narratives against the board. The phrase \"Psychological safety was a zero-interest rate phenomenon\" became emblematic of the company culture, especially following the first round of layoffs.\n\nThese layoffs have been a recurring theme, with at least four separate instances over the past year alone. The engineering leadership's contradictory characterizations of the individual contributors (ICs) as simultaneously 'entitled', 'under-performing', 'mis-skilled', yet 'world-class' reflect a deep-seated misalignment. This misalignment is further exacerbated by the leadership's demand for unquestioned adherence to an opaque strategy, where any attempt at seeking clarity is viewed as dissent.\n\nThe organizational structure has seen dramatic shifts. Initially, a layer of engineering directors was removed for their slow decision-making in an environment of impossible contradictory goals. More recently, a wave of new directors and department heads, predominantly from Google, were brought in, treating this Series D startup as if it operated with the culture and resources of a FAANG company. Despite these extensive changes, tangible improvements in engineering or product development haven't seemed to develop.\n\nCompounding these challenges is the absence of managers focused primarily on people management within the engineering organization. Every manager is also an individual contributor, creating a situation where managers are overburdened with dual responsibilities. This has led to a rapid turnover in management roles, with several individual contributors taking on managerial positions and reverting within a year, leaving a few with disproportionately large teams to manage.\n\nRecent calibration was particularly brutal. There is a recurring pattern of shifting goal posts and large pivots coming from left-field, and at impact review time everyone's previous quarter worth of work is judged on the vibes-du-jour instead of the goals that were set when action taking place. You can be set a goal by a one exec, then at calibration time be punished for achieving this goal by a different exec who retroactively disagrees with the goal (or was unaware of the goal, or disagreed but kept feedback to themselves until it grew to resentment).",

If you work at Sourcegraph, you can bet your days will be full of constant stress and anxiety. One mess up or one exec who doesn't like you means you'll be booted soon enough. Recruiters will sell you on what an awesome place Sourcegraph is. They don't have first hand experience of the day to day operations and they don't know the internal dynamics that exist in the company. They're totally out of touch and will just sell you on the high base salary and cool perks. Don't be fooled.",

        "cons": "Sourcegraph, a decade old company, has regressed to pre-product market fit after a recent strategic and product pivot. The new flagship product lacks significant differentiated from an equivalent Microsoft product with greater distribution and comparatively infinite runway.\n\nThe majority (if not all) of the exec team is working in their largest role, and those making decisions have very little experience working in teams they do not control with absolute power. Execs have opposing goals for the company and have continuously failed to build a team that they can or are willing to place their trust in. They will micromanage down to the IC level, and spend focus on controlling things like \"woke DEI culture\" at the expense of addressing key business challenges.\n\nCommunication is majorly problematic. PeopleOps and Communications teams find themselves frequently deleting or damage-controlling messages from executives. These messages undermine morale (sometimes punching-down to particular ICs) and create unnecessary panic, sometimes involving self-aggrandizing narratives against the board. The phrase \"Psychological safety was a zero-interest rate phenomenon\" became emblematic of the company culture, especially following the first round of layoffs.\n\nThese layoffs have been a recurring theme, with at least four separate instances over the past year alone. The engineering leadership's contradictory characterizations of the individual contributors (ICs) as simultaneously 'entitled', 'under-performing', 'mis-skilled', yet 'world-class' reflect a deep-seated misalignment. This misalignment is further exacerbated by the leadership's demand for unquestioned adherence to an opaque strategy, where any attempt at seeking clarity is viewed as dissent.\n\nThe organizational structure has seen dramatic shifts. Initially, a layer of engineering directors was removed for their slow decision-making in an environment of impossible contradictory goals. More recently, a wave of new directors and department heads, predominantly from Google, were brought in, treating this Series D startup as if it operated with the culture and resources of a FAANG company. Despite these extensive changes, tangible improvements in engineering or product development haven't seemed to develop.\n\nCompounding these challenges is the absence of managers focused primarily on people management within the engineering organization. Every manager is also an individual contributor, creating a situation where managers are overburdened with dual responsibilities. This has led to a rapid turnover in management roles, with several individual contributors taking on managerial positions and reverting within a year, leaving a few with disproportionately large teams to manage.\n\nRecent calibration was particularly brutal. There is a recurring pattern of shifting goal posts and large pivots coming from left-field, and at impact review time everyone's previous quarter worth of work is judged on the vibes-du-jour instead of the goals that were set when action taking place. You can be set a goal by a one exec, then at calibration time be punished for achieving this goal by a different exec who retroactively disagrees with the goal (or was unaware of the goal, or disagreed but kept feedback to themselves until it grew to resentment).",

The newest executive team member shows promise, bringing a unique blend of technical and leadership skills which seems to be a rarity at this level at Sourcegraph.

The culture around impact reviews tends to undermine the practicality of the unlimited PTO policy. Additionally, while the new executive's awareness of cultural issues is a positive step, the depth and complexity of these problems make significant improvements challenging.",

With the company at a crucial stage, your time and expertise could be more impactful in addressing strategic issues and steering the company towards success.\n\nFor the CTO: The key to great software development lies in a strong, well-supported team. Reflecting on the consistent feedback in these reviews could be enlightening. This introspection may help fine-tune your leadership approach, enhancing team dynamics and contributing positively to Sourcegraph’s trajectory.\n\nTo the ever-evolving leadership team at Sourcegraph: As you navigate your new roles, be mindful that job security has been a recurring challenge within the company. It's crucial not to take any outcomes personally. Numerous highly skilled predecessors have faced similar situations. Stay positive but honest, give it your best, and remember that the outcome is more about the company's ongoing dynamics than a measure of your individual talents. Wishing you the best of luck in your endeavors.",
        "cons": "I wanted to share some real talk about my time at Sourcegraph, especially since you might be considering a role there. It's always good to go in with both eyes open, right?\n\nThe work environment at Sourcegraph isn't just a mixed bag; it presents considerable challenges. They've made a strategic pivot recently, but that's only part of the story. The leadership team has been completely overhauled multiple times in just two years. It's tough to have any confidence in the longevity of the current leadership when you've seen their predecessors shown the door one after the other. Initially, these changes brought a sense of hope, but by the third round, it's hard not to feel a bit sorry for the new leaders who are trying their best - just like the last ones did.\n\nRegarding the executive team, to put it simply, they lack experience. There's a palpable sense of internal strife, almost like they're participants in their own version of the Hunger Games, each afraid of being the next to go. This atmosphere of uncertainty doesn't lead to outright micromanagement, but something perhaps more frustrating. Often, you'll receive vague directives like \"make it better\" without clear guidance on what that actually means. If you dare to ask for clarification, you risk being labeled as entitled. And remember, how you interpret and act on these vague instructions will come back around in your impact reviews, which I'll get into a bit more later.\n\nJob security is a significant concern. Layoffs have become a recurring theme, not just an occasional blip. It's happened several times over the last two years alone. With the management structure in constant flux, you never really feel settled. It's like standing on shifting sands, always unsure of where you stand or who you'll report to next or if they will even be left around by the next review cycle.\n\nNow, let's talk about the impact reviews. Sourcegraph has been around for a decade, so they're far from a startup. The real issue is that they're struggling to find a way to significantly increase revenue to finally IPO. The CEO and CTO seem to be out of fresh ideas, so there's this pressure on employees to come up with million-dollar ideas - or to “make it better” 😉. If you don't come up with something that substantially boosts the bottom line, you're labeled as not making an impact, putting you at risk of being in the next round of layoffs which always seem to be just around the corner. Even if you do come up with a great idea, it gets absorbed by the top brass, and then it's back to square one - you need another big idea, increase your commit rate (which gets judged at impact reviews) or go back to helping endless new hires, new management, and customer success team navigate a tech stack that's been left hollow by the departure of the many skilled devs that owned them but have left due to layoffs or attrition and hope that they perceive those efforts as impactful.\n\nIn short, while there are some perks like fair pay, the overall environment is fraught with peril, from unstable leadership and job insecurity to a high-pressure culture around million dollar feature ideas. It's a lot to take on, and I just wanted you to know what you might be getting into.\n\nWishing you the best in your job search and career. Take care!",

        "cons": "There was a big layoff in mid 2022, and since then, this place has been on a rapid decline. DEI was done away with quickly, and benefits began getting pulled left and right. Since then, there has been no sense of safety or longevity. You clock in each day with the idea that it could be your last.\n\nThe smartest leaders were shown the door, and the ones that kept their jobs were the loyalists to the exec suite's ideas, no matter how weak or deranged. The exec suite thought it was a good idea to change what we sold and for how much every few months, then berated teams for not hitting quota (which was next to impossible when there was no direction). \n\nThis environment quickly spiraled in to the Hunger Games. Exec meetings became tense and the ICs felt the trickle down as managers threw their own people under the bus. The calibration cycle almost a year ago was incredibly brutal, built solely on an agenda to make as many top performers quit as possible to save some cash. \n\nWhat used to make this place worthwhile (location-agnostic pay, work-life balance) doesn't exist anymore. Instead, you'll join a company that gets off on backstabbing, steamrolling, and punishment. The bad managers do nothing but gaslight and indulge in toxicity with their direct reports. They play favorites and if you're not in the \"in\" club, you'll be shown the pink slip soon enough. The ones that \"succeed\" here are the \"yes\" men (and yes, it is mostly men since DEI isn't a priority anymore) and the ones that are willing to put their health, mental state, and/or personal life on the line in order to get ahead for a company that will quickly lose the AI race to any number of stronger giants. Working late nights and weekends is the rule, not the exception, but they'll lead with their \"work from anywhere\" culture in interviews to make it seem reasonable. \n\nIt does not matter if you've been successful at Sourcegraph or have hit your goals consistently quarter after quarter. If they decide that they don't like you, you'll be gaslit, punished, and eventually pushed to leave.\n\nThey hire some of the smartest people that I've ever met, but they abuse them to the point that the best friends I made at Sourcegraph were due to trauma bonding together.",

      "# [The Death of the Junior Developer on 2024-06-24](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/the-death-of-the-junior-developer)\nWarning: This blog post is somewhat speculative; the sky might not be falling. But my spidey-sense is definitely tingling. The way we are all doing our jobs in software is changing, potentially in big ways. So let's think of this as a thought exercise.\n\nWith that disclaimer, we're off!\n\nI have been chatting with a bunch of both junior and senior developer-type folk at different companies lately. By cross-barfticulating these conversations I've picked up on an emerging new pattern, which is that like 80% of you are way smarter than me. My goodness. What have I been doing?\n\nBut also another pattern, which is that a lot of people picked a bad year to be a junior developer. A whole lot of people. I wouldn't want to be just getting started in the industry today.\n\nNot just the computer industry. Any industry. It's a bad year to be a junior anything.\n\nMy wife Linh and I are huge horror-movie buffs. So, to reflect the somber theme of today's rant, I will use horror movie titles to introduce our sections.\n\nLet's start by talking about what's happening to junior developers.\n\nThe Purge (2013)\n\nOur first story of the day is about a law firm and has nothing to do with programming. But it is indeed centrally relevant to the crisis that is just starting to loom ominously, as crises love to do. My buddy Gene Kim gave me permission to share this story about his friend who is a managing partner at a 50-person law firm.\n\nIn short, one might surmise that all hell is breaking loose at said law firm because of ChatGPT, with some wondering whether the entire structure of their firm, which has been stable for a very long time, might now be completely wrong. Their whole comp structure, pensions, succession planning, everything is going through an existential crisis due to a frigging chatbot.\n\nThe problem, you see, is that there could be a future where they don't need junior associates anymore.\n\nIncreasingly, they need only senior associates, who (a) describe the tasks to be done; i.e., create the prompts, and (b) review the resulting work for accuracy and correctness. The high-end LLMs do so well with tasks normally fielded by junior associate lawyers, that there isn't much room left for the real junior associates on payroll.\n\nThe LLM can produce research, summaries, briefs, contracts, memos, pleadings, petitions – anything they need. All the documents it creates are \"perfect\"… with the catch that if someone senior doesn't double check its work before a judge sees it you might wind up in jail or something.\n\nCatching the LLM in a hallucination, catching a junior associate in a mistake – pretty similar. Really just two options for generating the same output. Except one of those options is fast and tireless and essentially free. And the other one puked on the chocolate fountain at the holiday party.\n\nWhew. You picked a bad year to be a junior associate lawyer, that's for damn sure. Sorry, graduating class of 2024. Sucks to be you.\n\nThe Shining (1980)\n\nGene shared the law-firm story to illustrate how widespread this problem is. He suggests that the same chaos, which is undoubtedly unfolding across legal firms everywhere, could affect all writing and editorial jobs. You can imagine a world where demand for junior writers and editors starts to evaporate.\n\nMarket forces are nudging everyone towards having senior writers who are also good prompt engineers: An arrangement that meets all of their needs faster and cheaper than hiring junior humans.\n\nGene, as an accomplished and senior author, is delighted with his productivity gains with his LLM of choice, Claude Opus. He showed me a big writing project that he'd just finished, in which he had spent easily 45+ minutes crafting the prompt, refining it until he had a 7500-word narrative that could serve as a starting point for rewriting, editing, and adjustment. (In comparison, this blog post is about half that size.) And that draft was fantastic. I've read it and it's glorious.\n\nOn a good day, Gene can write 1,000 words per day. His estimate is that Claude did for him in 90 minutes what would normally have taken him ten days. It solves the \"blank-page problem\" and gets him to the 20-yard line, where the fun begins.\n\nHe estimates using an LLM as a writing tool gets him there 2-3x faster now, helping him meet his personal requirements and quality bar.\n\nGene could not be happier, at least for himself, because in addition to being faster, he also feels working this way is more fun. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, right? He's a happy dude.\n\nBut he is terrified for his teenage kids.\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)\n\nAnecdote: I watched the pod scene from the original black and white 50s version of this movie when I was about 8, and wow, that was traumatizingly scary. My wife has also been watching horror movies since she was about 4 (!) and we share a deep love of horror, probably because we're all messed up from childhood.\n\nWe've just seen the same plot play out for the legal profession and writing/editing jobs, where LLMs are threatening to out-people the people. Let's watch the same movie again in some genres closer to home.\n\nJust a few days ago our illustrious Head of AI, Rishabh Mehrotra, was showing me a classifier and multi-class prediction model that he had trained and deployed in a single day with ChatGPT. He said it would have been a 6-week University senior-level intern project a year ago. This is affecting data science too.\n\nAn old friend, great programmer and mathematician, who left AI for quantum computing for a few years, is back to programming. He confided – somewhat excitedly – that even though he does a lot of programming, he doesn't consider himself a programmer anymore.\n\nHe said he's more of a reviewer, or coach, or nanny, something like that. He makes ChatGPT do all the work and he just crafts prompts and reviews the output.\n\nThat resonated with me, since I, too, have been replaced by a bubble-bath plant pod human who pretends to be a programmer, but is in fact outsourcing almost all of it.\n\nNaturally, when I say \"make ChatGPT do all the work\", there is plenty of coding we still do by hand. What I mean is that chat-first is the default, and writing by hand (with completions, naturally!) is our fallback plan. My quantum friend and I are both finding much less need for that fallback recently.\n\nSince then I've found several other super amazing colleagues who have also adopted this coding strategy to accelerate themselves. And frankly it has been a bit of a relief to hear confirmation coming from so many great people that chat-first programming is indeed a New Thing.\n\nThe Thing (1982)\n\nIs it really new? Clearly this \"New Thing\" has already been around in other domains, since even the original ChatGPT was able to replace a lot of human labor.\n\nBut for coding, let's be serious here, chat coding has sucked. It would often be more effort to coax the LLM into a working solution than to write it yourself.\n\nWith the previous model generations, if you feed in an 800-line source code file and ask for substantial changes, even GPT4-Turbo (which many of you are using right now) will often run amok: Well-argued hallucinations, code that fails to parse, snarky \"code left as an exercise\" empty functions, designs leading you in circles going nowhere, unexpected refactorings, missing code, and all manner of other frustration.\n\nYou've probably tried it yourself. You know what I mean.\n\nSo chat programming has been sort of a bust. Nowadays most people equate AI coding assistants with code autocompletions. They think of chat as something you use when you're just starting out, maybe as a faster docs search.\n\nIn fact, there is a widespread perception that chat is for junior developers, and becomes less useful as you gain experience.\n\nAnd truth be told, this wasn't entirely inaccurate prior to mid-May. The models weren't quite there yet.\n\nBut for the past six weeks, things have been very, very different, and YOU my friend are missing out. That perception that chat is for juniors is now a flat-out misconception, one that I pray is stone dead in your heart by the end of this post.\n\nChopping Mall (1986)\n\nChat-based programming, which I will preemptively label Chat Oriented Programming (CHOP) or just \"chop\", because I suspect I'll be to be saying it a lot, is a brand-spanking new phenomenon. Like, seriously, just over a month old. I first noticed it when GPT-4o came out, which was mid-May.\n\nYou remember that big manufactured drama, right, about the new OpenAI \"4o\" GPT model supposedly having Scarlett Johansson's voice? That's the one.\n\nThat model changed everything about programming overnight.\n\nWhen GPT-4o dropped, it could suddenly edit 1000-line source files–a figure that encompasses 95+% of the source files in most repos worldwide–with tremendous precision and faithfulness to the original, leaving the untouched parts of the file 99.9% diff-perfect. Every once in a very rare while I see it drop a space character, or slightly mis-indent a line. But that's it.\n\nFrom what I've seen, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus have also cleared this hurdle. Which makes multi-model prompting a good bulwark against hallucinations, and a great way to select the best candidate for a design. Just feed your query to all of them and make ‘em fight it out. It's a common CHOP technique.\n\nBriefly, CHOP is coding via iterative prompt refinement. Everyone's attempts to get it to do anything complex used to peter out after 4 to 5 iterations, and the models couldn't make progress. But now your iterations usually converge, which means you're reviewing and ultimately approving more and more LLM code, and writing less and less yourself.\n\nSo programming has leveled up into a problem of explaining your situation to the LLM – that is, slinging context, since you'll want to include a lot of information from different sources – and then merging the output back into your code base.\n\nWe'd better get a tool for this. Chop chop!\n\nUpgrade (2018)\n\nThe big model upgrade was life-changing for people who have already been coding in raw ChatGPT, which is still the world's most-used and most popular AI coding assistant. ChatGPT coders have been using chop style for a year or more, but it has been only for the bravest, most patient, and dumbest of early adopters. Whereas now it's ready for everyone!\n\nOf course, raw chat involves a lot of manual assembly of context in and shoveling responses out, and it can get tedious, so many programmers use coding assistants instead. (I mean, I guess business is good if you are the CTRL, C, or V keys on a keyboard. Or ⌘ if you are into that sort of thing.)\n\nAll AI coding assistants benefit from this upgrade, too. It has certainly been huge for our coding assistant Cody, which in my opinion has the best chat due to our automated context assembly engine, which saves you from having to explain your code base every time. Plus Cody Pro lets you use both GPT-4o and Claude (and others), so you can spot-check all your work with another LLM.\n\nThe model upgrade is arguably even more effective with our inline edits feature, which handles dropping the response directly into your code. No more shoveling code out of the chat window. Cody just changes your code in place, undoably and retryably. The models are getting smarter, but the integration with your workflow is getting tighter as well.\n\nWhat's happening is a big deal. Programming this way is arguably on its way to being an order of magnitude speedup from completions-based programming. A 10x improvement might sound like an exaggeration. But we just saw examples from legal practice, publishing, and data science in the same ballpark, with 5-30x speedups for certain kinds of tasks, and estimates of at least 2-3x overall boost to productivity.\n\nYou can quibble over the numbers, but it's clear that programmers using CHOP with these new models are getting a turbo boost.\n\nWhy aren't you upgraded yet?\n\nThe Mangler (1995)\n\nTrivia: My brother told me that movie was so scary that he had to leave the theater. Never saw it myself, but the short story was fun.\n\nWe're going to do story #5 now, the very last story, and it's mine, and it's about programming, and the plot is different from the others.\n\nThis is where we learn the hard way why chat programming is for senior devs. Please keep your hands and limbs inside the carriage during the ride.\n\nThe other day GPT-4o shocked me with one of its coding proposals, while I was chopping away with it at a project. It was such a shock that I laughed for minutes, practically unhinged. I am not often shocked, least of all by looking at the code for a working program.\n\nI had presented a small design problem to GPT, asking for an evaluation of my options. It's great for that. Chat-oriented programming (CHOP) isn't just about coding. There are a lot of design discussions too. You do everything, even writing sometimes, with the LLM as a pair partner.\n\nFor some reason, this time ChatGPT launched full-bore into redesigning an entire subsystem of the framework I was stuck in, which had an issue I was trying to work around. I'm sure you have seen this wack behavior from LLMs before. The difference is, now they are very good at rewriting things, and sometimes they'll swing for the fences, consequences schmonsequences.\n\nGPT-4o breezed quickly past most of the sane options before plowing straight into \"let's rewrite it all\" scorched-earth mode, clearly not having read Joel Spolsky. It spewed out an unusually long answer, hundreds of lines of code and instructions, presenting thorough and persuasive reasoning supporting this approach.\n\nAnd the rewrite would have worked! It was a very direct solution to my problem. So it wasn't \"wrong\" per se. There are rarely things in design that are truly wrong – like, wrong wrong – as there are exceptions to most rules.\n\nThere was only one teeny tiny issue with it, which is that it would have killed someone.\n\nNot on my project, hopefully! But if the model is currently spitting out similar suggestions to people working on software that controls giant saws in machine shops, someone's gonna die.\n\nCabin in the Woods (2011)\n\nGPT's redesign was awful – but not when you looked directly at it. Up close it was downright cozy.\n\nYou had to pull back and look at the design in the broader context of its interactions with other subsystems, but also support, maintenance, upgrades, add-ons, and a bunch of other dimensions that are critically important to software design and engineering. With that wider lens, it was an Unbreakable-level train wreck waiting to happen.\n\nBut it was wearing a superb disguise. A less experienced dev would surely have fallen for it. I could feel the power and the attraction of the approach it was espousing, the force of the arguments backing it. The whole thing was appealingly packaged, technically correct, and laid out for you to just take it and run! (My pal Chris Smith says the word I'm looking for is \"specious\". So yeah, that.)\n\nAnd it just hit me all at once how hilariously inappropriate and potentially dangerous this answer was. It was so impressive and so spooky. I laughed and laughed, like a little kid watching bubble bath plant monsters replacing all the people.\n\nMy senior colleagues have recently recounted similar chat scenarios in which a more junior dev would have been completely taken in, potentially losing days to weeks of work going the wrong direction.\n\nOr worse.\n\nChat, it seems, is safer for senior programmers than it is for junior ones. And a lot of companies are going to interpret \"safer\" to mean \"better.\"\n\nBuckle up. Topsy-turvy times ahead.\n\nThe Stand (2020)\n\nA lot of companies ask me, how can we tell which parts were written by the AI and which parts by the programmer? Well, if chat-oriented programming becomes the dominant modality for programmers, then LLMs will be writing the vast majority of all source code worldwide. That's a gargantuan shift, and it might even shake up the traditional software engineering roles.\n\nWe've seen how this shift affected a law firm, a publisher, and engineering's sibling discipline of data science. Stock in junior contributors is down, and there is concern there could be a market crash.\n\nThat presents a very serious problem for new people in those fields. What do you do? How do you learn the ropes, not to mention find gainful employment? What are the ropes now? And what do the companies do when their senior people retire?\n\nThey could wind up like the COBOL world which is in a worldwide crunch, because there are no junior COBOL devs to replace the ones who retired. Ironically, these huge legacy companies will likely be rooting hardest for the LLMs to write all their code.\n\nThings are changing fast. I'm an optimist, and I generally think, or at least hope, that as companies become more productive in the coming months and years, they simply get correspondingly more ambitious.\n\nEveryone will need to get a lot more serious about testing and reviewing code. Senior devs could become full-time reviewers and junior devs shepherd the LLMs, maybe?\n\nIt doesn't necessarily have to end with a post-apocalyptic wasteland for recent CS grads.\n\n28 Days Later (2002)\n\nI wrote this post a week ago and have been thinking hard about whether I believe the premise, which is that within a few years, the norm for source code will be that it is written and modified by LLMs via prompting. For all practical purposes, all source code will be written this way, with exceptions becoming ever rarer.\n\nNot only do I believe it, I could even see it happening in 12-18 months at the current rate of LLM progress. I think the change will have a ton of fallout, only some of it foreseeable. And one casualty might well be junior devs, in the sense that they become less marketable and it could cause various kinds of crunches across the industry.\n\nWe've already seen the big companies doing eng layoffs to make room for AI practitioners. Small companies may be faced with their own version of this decision: Why hire a junior developer to write mediocre code, when the LLM will do that for you ten times faster?\n\nSo yeah. I'm worried.\n\nBriefly, what do I mean by \"senior\" here? Really just two things:\n\nYou know what you want before the AI writes it. You already have a vision for how you would write this by hand, or have it narrowed to a few reasonable options.\n\nYou can detect when it is giving you bad guidance.\n\nIf you know exactly where you are driving, and you know what bad roads look like, then turbochargers can be safe and will get you there faster. If you're not sure where you're driving, activating the turbochargers will get you somewhere fast.\n\nLeave the World Behind (2023)\n\nSo. You've made it this far. Congrats!. What's going to happen? I don't know. Maybe we'll get really lucky. I mean, I'd be very happy to be wrong here.\n\nBut change is coming. There will be social and cultural upheaval in tech, just as is happening in the legal profession. It's already begun. The models are getting smarter and smarter with each passing month, which means they are going to be eating more and more jobs until they eat the world.\n\nAll I can tell you is this: Get there early. One time Googlers were complaining at TGIF that the parking garage was filling up by midmorning, and Larry Page jokingly suggested, \"Maybe you should come earlier.\" At that moment he reeked of billionaire. But if you really wanted to park in the garage, you took his advice.\n\nIf you want to survive the change, you'd better show up prepared and stay on top of it.\n\nThe rest of this post is just some direct, simple, and timeless advice for junior and aspiring software engineers. I hope it can help get you through this awkward period where our industry collectively figures out what exactly the hell is going to happen.\n\nFinal Destination (2000)\n\nGet good, fast. That's what you need to do. Get ahead of the slackers while our industry turns upside down, and you might be the one to survive.\n\nYou are competing with students from Waterloo, who have 2+ years of actual work experience by the time they graduate with a bachelor's in CS. You're also competing with the top 10% of all CS grads nationwide, who are, year after year, already effectively senior engineers, despite this being their first real job.\n\nHere are some shotgun recommendations. Do with them as you see fit.\n\nGain experience anywhere and any way you can, before you even leave school. Get work experience, contribute to OSS, program on the side. Take your classes seriously. Learn more than is required for passing each class. Learn each subject thoroughly, and revisit them all as you go.\n\nDon't over-index on programming language arcana. That's becoming a detail that machines handle for us. Focus on algorithms, data structures, software design and engineering, discrete math, operating systems, compilers, databases, networks. Focus on studying real systems. Find walkthroughs online and study them. And of course ML. Gobble up everything you can.\n\nUnderstand how things are built. Make sure you know how every system in a computer works. Make sure you have an understanding of how every cloud service you depend on does its job. Read the docs, and then read the design docs. You won't have to write any of it by hand. But you need to develop a senior programmer's sensibilities around how these things fit together and interact, for good or ill.\n\nLearn how to use frontier models to check other LLM models' work. Sign up for multiple services (e.g. Claude and ChatGPT) and send your important prompts to at least two big models. Have them evaluate each other's responses and study it all carefully. LLMs are better at reviewing and critiquing their own content than they are at producing it. So use a second LLM as your senior partner.\n\nAnother one of the key things that differentiates a senior developer from a junior one, in many contexts, is Operations experience. Read the O'Reilly/Google SRE book. Read it cover to cover. And find a good GitOps book, too; there seem to be quite a few to choose from. There may be no compression algorithm for experience, but fortunately a lot of that experience has been condensed and distilled. Go drink it up.\n\nLean hard on a coding assistant like Cody. Stay on the bleeding edge of features. A coding assistant is a powerful tool, like an IDE, and learning to master it will level you up as a programmer. CHOP involves a lot of manual context shoveling to craft your prompt. Cody does 90% of that shoveling for you, as well as copying the responses back into your code.\n\nMost devs using chat still use raw ChatGPT for coding, even though it doesn't help you with context fetching or data shoveling. And it's great all by itself, though more manual work in prompt crafting. I have been using GPT directly in Emacs, with the excellent chatgpt-shell, because I'm still building Cody for Emacs so I can't use it yet. Raw GPT-4o is still great.\n\nI used to tell people to master an IDE, and even better, also Emacs or Neovim. But I'm not sure anymore. That might become obsolete soon. Wait until the coding assistants can do it for you; it won't be long. Or even come help.\n\nIt doesn't matter what approach you take, as long as you start making heavy use of chat in programming. Because that, friendo, is how it works now. Like it or not. And you need to survive it. Good luck to you.\n\nI will start a channel soon dedicated to showing the new way of programming, as I help build Cody using chop-style coding. I will use both ChatGPT directly and Cody, and they will help me build Cody. Stay tuned!\n\nI'll also be giving a talk that touches on this and much more in August at the Enterprise Technology Leadership Summit in Las Vegas. Hope to see you there.\n\nP.S. Thanks to Chris Smith, Gene Kim, Dominic Cooney, and Anna Noak for their thorough reviews and great suggestions.",
      "# [Issues with Cody Not Finding Relevant Files Compared to Cursor on 2024-08-19](https://community.sourcegraph.com/t/issues-with-cody-not-finding-relevant-files-compared-to-cursor/908)\nI just want to let the developers know that I’m getting “empty” results in terms of file numbers when asking questions that Cursor can easily handle. For example, when I ask something like, “Where is the movement system for characters in this game?” Cursor successfully identifies the main Movement script along with several other related scripts. However, Cody fails to find any relevant files and instead provides explanations based on the project name, without identifying the actual files. This isn’t an isolated issue—it’s the same for any other questions I ask. Because of this, I’ve completely stopped using Cody for navigating my codebase.\n\nJust to clarify, in case it matters: my projects are Unity projects with 10-200 scripts, many folders, and a functioning Codyignore file (which excludes plenty of folders and files). I know the ignore file is working because Cody doesn’t interact with the ignored files.\n\nI’m open to the possibility that my issues are caused by an unstable Codyignore, but when I see articles like this one (Chat-oriented programming (CHOP) in action), “Let’s ask something a little more complex - such as how would I add a new LLM model to our Cody VS Code extension.” - I’m amazed that I can’t achieve anything even remotely similar. I’m curious if the developers are aware of these issues and if they are being worked on, or if I’m the only one experiencing this?\n\nHi there!\n\nWhile trying to take a screenshot, I managed to narrow down the issue a bit.\n\nA lot of it has to do with the language used for the query. When using Cursor, I’m used to making queries in a language other than English, and this usually doesn’t cause any issues. With Cody, things at least start working when I make queries in English (in both blended and embeddings modes). This partially resolves the problem for me… But an automatic translation of the query into English (which seems to be critical) would be much more convenient for many users whose native language is not English.\n\nWhat practically doesn’t work at all (or works strangely) in any language is the “Keyword” context mode. I noticed something else during testing: in this mode, it’s critical not to place punctuation marks immediately after the last letter. I’m attaching two screenshots in this mode. In one of them, the question mark is attached to the last word (and the chat can’t find any files), while in the other, it’s not (apparently, this is the correct way to search, but how would a user know this?)—and the chat finds a file, but it’s the wrong one! And that’s odd—it’s clear from the screenshot that I have a file with that name, which contains a class with that name. But Cody suggests a different file for some reason.\n\nRegarding the embeddings mode, as I found out earlier, it generally works in English. And I could probably rely on it. But there are two important nuances, especially the second one, which makes it difficult to do so, unlike with Cursor:\n\n3.1. First, Cody indexes everything, the entire project. In my case (a Unity game), it indexes 1000 times more than necessary, ignoring the ignore file. I’m not sure if this is good for subsequent efficiency, but I hope that during the queries, the ignore file will at least help avoid distractions. In any case, indexing a new project can take 20-30 minutes. I tried switching to the pre-release version (v1.31.1724080603), and maybe I misunderstood something, but it seems like no indexing happens at all in that version.\n\n3.2. More importantly, the indexing frequency. In Cursor, it happens every 10 minutes and can be initiated manually. Considering that the ignore file is taken into account there, it only takes a few seconds. When the indexing of updates happens in Cody, I don’t understand at all. Sometimes something significant changes in the project within minutes, and waiting for it for weeks (or however long it takes) seems strange. I know that you can delete the corresponding files for re-indexing, but then you’ll have to wait another 30 minutes.\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time on these experiments and descriptions for you, and I hope that this helps improve something.\n\n.\n\n!/.cody\n\n!.ignore\n\n!/Assets/\n\n/Assets/*\n\n!/Assets/Scripts/\n\n!.txt\n\n!.cs",
      "# [mentions and information from your dev tools, shown everywhere you read/write code on 2024-05-20](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/openctx-at-mentions-for-code-ai)\nFor devs, it’s quite annoying to switch among tons of different tools when coding: open the issue in Linear or Jira, jump into Figma, find the PR, look up the error on Sentry, check the traces on Jaeger, and so on.\n\nA few months ago we set out to improve that with an experiment we call OpenCtx (Apache 2.0 OSS), a super simple standard for bringing tiny links and info chips from all these tools into anywhere you read code...\n\nIn your editor:\n\nIn code review:\n\nAnd in code search:\n\nYes, you could install editor extensions for all those tools in just the right way to get something similar in your editor, but that’ll be a lot of work and doesn’t help you in your code review tool. And even if you got it set up just right, good luck getting your entire team to do the same.\n\nAs we hacked on it and shared it with other devs and customers, we heard some things over and over again:\n\nPretty much every dev admits to sometimes being too lazy to check the expensive observability tools their company pays for when debugging an issue where they’d probably be helpful.\n\nMost devs need to check their internal docs or ask someone on team chat to get the current way (not the deprecated way) to check user analytics or feature flag stats for a certain feature.\n\nMost companies have some internal dev tools that are poorly integrated and will remain so because it’s not worth it to build good editor extensions for them.\n\nOpenCtx can help with all of these things by making other dev tools’ information visible right in the editor or code review.\n\n(While it's still an experimental project, it's been heavily validated by devs and our customers, and we're working hard to ship an OpenCtx beta in Sourcegraph's code search and Cody that you all will love.)\n\nNext: @-mentions for code AI to consume\n\nBut the problem's getting worse. Now it’s not just human devs who need to bop between all their dev tools. Code AI tools (like our Cody) also need to tap all these tools for context:\n\nTo fix the damn bug, the code AI needs to see the error message from Sentry or Splunk or Datadog.\n\nTo build a new feature, the code AI needs to see the Linear or Jira or GitHub issue and the Figma mocks.\n\nTo suggest API changes, the code AI needs to see all call sites and runtime traces.\n\nTo review code, the code AI needs to see your design docs in Google Docs or Notion.\n\nTo write idiomatic code, the code AI needs to see your coding standards doc in your wiki or Confluence.\n\nSure, code AI often gets lucky and performs surprisingly well on these tasks without the right context. But given better context, the same LLM can solve more complex problems. Everyone calls this technique \"RAG\" now, but I much prefer how Steve Yegge referred to it as \"cheating.\"\n\n(By the way, more context improves the one-shot performance of models. But you can also feed context about the correctness of code back into the system and perform repeated iterations to get to the final correct code. This is what I call the ƒ(code), and Steve Yegge calls it the self-driving IDE.)\n\nSo, as planned, we're extending OpenCtx to also support @-mentions of any information in other dev tools. That means in Cody and other OpenCtx-supported clients, when you're chatting about code with AI, you can @-mention an issue, logs, docs, mocks, traces, etc., and the content will be shown to the AI alongside your chat message to give you a better answer.\n\nToday, we're shipping some experimental pieces to push this forward (all open-source under the Apache 2.0 license):\n\nAn @-mention context provider for web pages, so you can include the contents of any web page in a code AI chat.\n\nSupport for OpenCtx @-mentions in Cody chat, which supports GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Mixtral 8x22B, and Ollama local models. (The Cody client is open source.)\n\nThe Cody for VS Code prerelease build due later today on the marketplace will support web page @-mentions for all users in Cody chat.\n\n@openctx/vscode-lib, an npm package that makes it easy to add support for OpenCtx in any other VS Code extension that does code AI chat. (See how Cody uses it.)\n\n2 new OpenCtx protocol methods to support these features: meta (to show which dev tools you can @-mention) and mentions (to query for mentionable things after the user types @).\n\nThere are tons of cool demos that could be made about OpenCtx @-mentions, but we want to get feedback from our own usage and community members' usage before pitching this experimental feature to end users. Tone down the hype, you might say. We're excited to hear your feedback and see what kinds of OpenCtx providers (to bring in information from other dev tools) and clients (to integrate with more editors, code hosts, etc.) you build!\n\nOpenCtx is an open standard\n\nNot only is OpenCtx open source (Apache 2), it's designed to be open. OpenCtx providers are just URLs that implement an open standard, so everybody can participate freely and equally. This is important because devs deserve to be able to use the best tools and integrate them with each other.\n\nCheck out openctx.org, see the code in sourcegraph/openctx (Apache 2.0), follow @sqs for updates, and discuss stuff in the forum.",
      "# [Sourcegraph went dark](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41296481)\nThanks for being a fan. And I understand it's a bummer to not have our code be public and open-source anymore. Sorry.\n\nIt's a bunch of reasons that add up. I'll give some more details for anyone curious.\n\n(And I know that despite these reasons, lots of HNers probably wish it was not so. I agree! I too wish for a world where all companies could have their code be public and open source.)\n\n- We have a lot of tech around large-scale code graph, indexing, etc., stuff that is very differentiated and hard to build. We were starting to put some of this in separate private repositories and link them in at build time, but that was complex. It added a lot of code complexity, risked bugs, and slowed us down, and if a lot of the awesome stuff was private anyway, what was the point?\n\n- As we've been building Cody (https://cody.dev), our code AI tool, we've seen a LOT more abuse. That's what happens when you offer any free tier of a product with LLM inference. We had to move a lot more of our internal backend abuse logic to private repositories, and it added code complexity to incorporate that private stuff in at build time.\n\n- It confused devs and customers to have 2 releases: an open-source release with less scaley/enterprisey features, and an enterprise release. It was a pain to migrate from one to the other (GitLab also felt this pain with their product) because the open-source build had a subset of the DB schema and other things. It was confusing to have a free tier on the enterprise release (lots of people got that mixed up with the open-source release), and it made our pricing and packaging complex so that lots of our time was spent helping customers understand what is paid and what isn't.\n\n- There were actually very very few companies that were going to pay but then decided to use the open-source version and not pay us. A lot of people probably assume that's why we made this move, but it's not. I think this is because people like the product and see value in it, including all the large-scale code nav/search features that are in our enterprise version.\n\n- Although very very few companies used our open-source version to avoid paying us, we did see it cause a lot of annoyance for devs who were asked by their management to try cloning our product or to research our codebase to give their procurement team ammunition to negotiate down our price. This honestly was just a waste of everyone's time.\n\n- If we got a ton of contributions (we never really solicited any), then it might've changed the calculus. Sourcegraph is an end-user application that you use at work (and when fun-coding, but the primary revenue model is for us to charge companies). For various reason, end-user server-side applications just don't get nearly as many contributions. Maybe it's because you'd need to redeploy your build for a bunch of other users at your company, not just yourself. Maybe it's because they necessarily entail UX, frontend, and scaling stuff, in addition to just adding new features.\n\n- We heard from people who left GitHub that people at GitHub were frequently monitoring our repository to get wind of our upcoming features and launches. Someone from GitHub told me his \"job is to clone Sourcegraph\". Since then, they obviously deprioritized their code search to re-found GitHub on AI, so we're not seeing this threat anymore. But I didn't love giving Microsoft an unfair advantage, especially since GitHub products are not open source either.\n\n- Since we made our code non-open-source, we've been able to pursue a lot more big partnerships (e.g., with cloud providers and other distribution partners and resellers). This is a valuable revenue stream that helps us make a better product overall. Again, because Sourcegraph is an end-user application with a UI that devs constantly use and care about, we never really had the MongoDB/Redis/CockroachDB risk of AWS/GCP/Azure just deploying our stuff and cutting us out. We're not protecting from downside here, but we are enjoying the upside because now those kinds of distribution partnerships are viable for us. To give a specific example, within ~2 months of making our code non-open-source last year, we signed a $1M+ ARR deal through a distribution partner that would not have happened if our code was open source. This is not our biggest annual deal, but it's still really nice!\n\nWe are totally focused on building the best code search/intelligence and appreciate all our customers and all the feedback here. Hope this helps explain a bit more where we're coming from!\n\nI don't see any attempt to veil it -- there was specific mention of revenue and competitors\n\nDid SourceGraph make any promises about a community or free support? (honest question)\n\nI think your expectations may be off, perhaps learned from corporate marketing. \"Open source\" by itself does not mean necessarily\n\n1. you get any support\n\n2. there is a community [1]\n\n3. you're entitled to all future source code by that person or company, whether under the same project name or not.\n\n---\n\nIt could be that SourceGraph has broken some promises, and that IS pretty typical of VC-backed companies.\n\nBut so far I don't see evidence of that.\n\nQuoting my comment: https://lobste.rs/s/tg5vwi/sourcegraph_went_dark#c_vnaqxu\n\nEven according to Stallman, free software never required any kind of support, open development, or commit history. You can publish a tarball on a web server, and that counts as free software.\n\ni.e. publishing source code doesn’t sign you up for a lifelong obligation. People can fork it, or not fork it.\n\n---\n\nPractically speaking, I might think of SourceGraph as something like Android.\n\nIs Android open source? Yes. [2]\n\nDoes it have huge proprietary parts? Yes.\n\nIt is designed for collaborative development? Not really unless you work for a big company, and are paid to work on Android. (That said, I'm sure there are hobbyists / \"people in their basement\" that do meaningful things with Android source code -- and actually I think that is how some open phone companies started)\n\nIs it better than it's open rather than closed? Yes. Multiple competitors to Google use Android source code, e.g. Amazon has built phones off of it. That is good thing IMO.\n\n---\n\n[1] On my own open source projects, there is a community and best-effort support, and I really encourage that! But the point is that there are MULTIPLE valid project models under the name \"open source\".\n\nThrowing code over the wall is actually valid open source, and it actually benefits society IMO. It's still valuable, even if you STOP doing it, as SourceGraph has done.\n\nIt's distinct from \"I get free stuff that I like using\"\n\nThere could be a different name for \"unfunded or independently funded open source\", but the funny thing is that the term \"open source\" originated as a corporate-friendly alternative to \"free software\"\n\n[2] As a tangent, I also think Android has a really suboptimal and cloud-slanted architecture, but for this discussion, let's just use it as a an example of corporate open source",

      "# [Efficient scaleups in 2024 vs 2021: Sourcegraph (with CEO & Co by Gergely Orosz on 2024-10-09](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/quinn-slack-efficient-scalups)\nThe Pragmatic Engineer Podcast had a very warm reception with the first episode — thank you! Two weeks later, here is episode #2, with a CEO who still codes every day: Quinn Slack at Sourcegraph.\n\nListen now on Apple, Spotify, and YouTube.\n\nBrought to you by:\n\n• Paragon: ​​Build native, customer-facing SaaS integrations 7x faster.\n\n• Enterprise Ready Conferfence on 30 October: a one-day event in SF for product and engineering leaders shaping the future of enterprise SaaS.\n\nOn today’s episode of The Pragmatic Engineer, I’m joined by Quinn Slack, CEO and co-founder of Sourcegraph, a leading code search and intelligence platform. Quinn holds a degree in Computer Science from Stanford and is deeply passionate about coding: to the point that he still codes every day! He also serves on the board of Hack Club, a national nonprofit dedicated to bringing coding clubs to high schools nationwide. In this insightful conversation, we discuss:\n\nHow Sourcegraph's operations have evolved since 2021\n\nWhy more software engineers should focus on delivering business value\n\nWhy Quinn continues to code every day, even as a CEO\n\nPractical AI and LLM use cases and a phased approach to their adoption\n\nThe story behind Job Fairs at Sourcegraph and why it’s no longer in use\n\nQuinn’s leadership style and his focus on customers and product excellence\n\nThe shift from location-independent pay to zone-based pay at Sourcegraph\n\nAnd much more!\n\nTakeaways\n\nSome of my main takeaways from this conversation are these.\n\n1. As software engineers, it’s increasingly important to understand what value you add to the business. A big difference between 2021 and 2024 is how companies are much more focused on efficiency: meaning they are hiring more conservatively, and less likely to fund teams with headcount that don’t contribute to the core focus of the company.\n\nAs a developer or manager, try to figure out how much your team contributes in revenue, or savings, or other key goals to the company. Are you working in what the company would consider as a profit center, or what is more as a cost center? We did a deepdive on this topic in The Pragmatic Engineer: check out the article, linked in the show notes.\n\n2. AI tools are great to eliminate the toil that we, developers face, day-to-day. There are AI tools that position themselves as their goal being “replacing developers.” I found it sympathetic that Quinn did not think this is the sensible path. His approach is to start by using AI tools with some of the “dumbest things” like generating the changelog for a software release – I mean, assuming you generate a changelog. And then you take tedious tasks where these tools could help, and see if you can automate some more.\n\nDo this one step at a time: and it will actually help devs and teams, and it’s a lot more achievable than saying “let’s replace this whole complicated workflow with AI.”\n\n3. The reality of location independent pay is that it stops being sensible above a certain company size. Sourcegraph was one of the few companies that offered the same base salary regardless of where people worked at. They did this until they grew to about 200 people, and switched this model to a location-indexed model.\n\nQuinn was honest about why they did it: because keeping this would have not made sense for the company, from the business point of view. Basically, location-independent pay means the company can hire very easily in low-cost regions, but it’s hard or impossible to do this in high-cost regions. It also creates the incentive for employees to move to a low cost region where they can save more. In the end, I don’t know of any company with more than 200 people that pays location-independent: all large companies have some kind of indexing on location, and the best companies just pay the top of the local market. We cover more about compensation in the deepdive on The trimodal nature of software engineering salaries.\n\nIf you enjoy the podcast, I’d very much appreciate if you subscribe on your favorite podcast player, and leave a review.

      "# [Sourcegraph went dark on 2024-08-19](https://eric-fritz.com/articles/sourcegraph-went-dark/)\nTowards the end of my mid-2019 job search, I was down to joining the Google Go team or Sourcegraph. Sourcegraph ultimately won due to cultural factors - the most important of which was the ability to build 100% in the open. All documents were public by default. Technical and product RFCs (and later PR/FAQs) were drafted, reviewed, and catalogued in a public Google Drive folder. All product implementation was done in public GitHub repositories.\n\nToday, the sourcegraph/sourcegraph repository went private. This is the final cleaving blow, following many other smaller chops, on the culture that made Sourcegraph an attractive place to work. It’s a decision for a business from which I resigned, and therefore have no voice. But I still lament the rocky accessibility of artifacts showing four years of genuine effort into a product that I loved (and miss the use of daily in my current role).\n\nOn the bright side, I’ve cemented my place on the insights leaderboard for the remainder of time.\n\nKeeping references alive\n\nOver my tenure at Sourcegraph I’ve done a fair bit of writing for the engineering blog, which I’ve inlined into this website for stable reference. It’s interesting to see what people are trying to build and, for an engineer, how they’re trying to build it. Much of my writing used links into relevant public code as a reference.\n\nAll of these links are now broken.\n\nThere’s a common saying that cool URIs don’t change. In a related sense, I have the hot take that cool articles don’t suddenly start rotting links. I’m going to break at least one of these best practices, and I can’t do anything about the first one. So I’ll attempt to preserve as much information in this writing as possible by moving these links into a repository under my influence.\n\nI'm opting to bite the bullet now and move references to something completely under my control rather than kick then can down the road by referencing another repository that _could_ suddenly disappear at any time.\n\nI had a feeling this would be a risk a while ago, so I had forked sourcegraph/sourcegraph into efritz/sourcegraph in preparation. Given the fork, it should be easy enough job to do a global find-and-replace of one repository name with another at this point and mission accomplished, right?\n\nUnfortunately, no. I had links to code on the main branch, but also links to pull requests and commits within pull requests. Forks don’t inherit pull requests (problem #1). And commits not directly referenced by a branch of your fork are visible as only as long as they’re part of the repository network (problem #2).\n\nI had wondered what happens to forks when a repository is deleted or changes visibility and found some calming information in the official GitHub documentation:\n\nIn other words, a public repository’s forks will remain public in their own separate repository network even after the upstream repository is made private. This allows the fork owners to continue to work and collaborate without interruption. […] If a public repository is made private and then deleted, its public forks will continue to exist in a separate network.\n\nMy fork will continue to exist (yay), but the source repository becoming inaccessible might take commits outside of the main branch with it. I need to ensure that these commits are part of the new repository network.\n\nScraping for relevant commits\n\nStep one is to find all the commits I care about. I ran the following Go program to iterate through all of my pull requests on the source repository and write their payloads to disk for further processing.\n\nThis program yielded 2,645 files with pull request metadata. I then used jq to read these JSON payloads and extract data for subsequent steps.\n\nThis script creates three files:\n\npr_ids.txt is a flat list of GitHub identifiers, which are used in URLs. Since the list endpoint returns only enough data to render a pull request list, we’ll need to fetch additional information (intermediate commits) for each pull request by its ID.\n\ncommits.txt is a flat list of git SHAs that were a result of merging a PR into the target branch (not always main). These commits may or may not be in the forked repository network, depending on the merge target. These should be synced over.\n\nreplace_pairs.txt contains pairs of of pull request identifier and its merge commit. This will later be used to mass replace /pull/{id} with /commit/{sha}. Since pull requests can’t be linked directly anymore, I can at least link to the full pull request contents.\n\nNext, I ran a second program (with the same preamble as the program above) to list all the non-merge commits of each pull request. Based on the pants-on-head way I work, these will mostly be WIP. commits, but sometimes I did a better job and (possibly) linked directly to these.\n\nRunning go run . >> commits.txt dumped these commits onto the end of the file and completes the set of Git SHAs that need to be brought into the repository network for stable reference.\n\nBringing commits into the new repository network\n\nGiven the warning above (“does not belong to any branch on this repository”), it should be sufficient to ensure that my fork has a branch containing each relevant SHA I’d like to retain access to.\n\nBash here does a good enough job since all we’re doing is a bunch of git operations in sequence.\n\nRewriting references\n\nAt this point I should be safe and have some target to link to in my fork for each reference to a pull request or commit in the source repository. Now I just have to figure out how to automate that process (there are at least 275 code references over 15 files and I’m not doing that by hand).\n\nIronically, I used my own thing instead of Cody to figure out how to use xargs correctly for this task.",
