      "# [Open in Editor](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/open_in_editor)\nWith a click of a button, you can jump from any file in Sourcegraph to your preferred editor. It only takes a minute to set up.\n\nGet started\n\nIf you haven’t used the feature, find the button on the right side of your screen:\n\nWhen you click it, a small popup appears where you’ll need to set two things: a projects path and your editor.\n\nThe projects path is the folder where you store your projects. Enter any Linux, Windows, or macOS absolute path.\n\nExample: If your projects path is /home/username/projects, one of your repos is https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/, and you want to open README in the root folder of the repo, then the feature will look for the file at /home/username/project/sourcegraph/README.\n\nThen choose your preferred editor from the list. We support VS Code, Atom, Sublime Text, and JetBrains IDEs ( AppCode, CLion, GoLand, IntelliJ IDEA, PhpStorm, PyCharm, Rider, RubyMine, WebStorm, and all new IDEs that JetBrains releases). If you use a different editor, check out “Advanced config” below.\n\nOnce you click Save, the icon will you’ll be able to jump to your editor from any file in Sourcegraph.\n\nAdvanced config\n\nIf you want to dig deeper, there are a bunch of optional settings to play with. Click your name at the top-right, select Settings, and add the \"openInEditor\": {} key to your user setting JSON.\n\neditorIds: an array of short names of an editor (“vscode”, “idea”, “sublime”, “pycharm”, etc.) or “custom”. This is what you set in the dropdown when you first set up the feature.\n\nNote that the initial setup UI only allows you to select one editor, but if you use multiple editors, you can manually add more. Each of them will have an icon on your toolbar.\n\ncustom.urlPattern: If you set editorId to “custom” then this must be set, too. Use the placeholders “%file”, “%line”, and “%col” to mark where the file path, line number, and column number must be inserted. Example URL pattern for IntelliJ IDEA: idea://open?file=%file&line=%line&column=%col\n\nprojectPaths.default: This is what you set in the form when you first set up the feature: The absolute path on your computer where your git repositories live. All git repos to open have to be cloned under this path with their original names. /Users/yourusername/src is a valid absolute path, ~/src is not. Works both with and without a trailing slash.\n\nprojectPaths.linux: Overwrites the default path on Linux. Handy if you use different environments. Works both with and without a trailing slash.\n\nprojectPaths.mac: Overwrites the default path on macOS. Works both with and without a trailing slash.\n\nprojectPaths.windows: Overwrites the default path on Windows. Works both with and without a trailing backslash.\n\nreplacements: Key-value pairs. Each key will be replaced by the corresponding value in the final URL. Keys are regular expressions, values can contain backreferences ($1, $2, ...).\n\njetbrains.forceApi: Forces using protocol handlers (like idea://open?file=...) or the built-in REST API (http://localhost:63342/api/file...). If omitted, protocol handlers are used if available, otherwise the built-in REST API is used.\n\nvscode.isProjectPathUNCPath: Indicates that the given projects path is a UNC (Universal Naming Convention) path.\n\nvscode.useInsiders: If set, files will open in VS Code Insiders rather than VS Code.\n\nvscode.useSSH: If set, files will open on a remote server via SSH. This requires vscode.remoteHostForSSH to be specified and VS Code extension “Remote Development by Microsoft” installed in your VS Code.\n\nvscode.remoteHostForSSH: The remote host as USER@HOSTNAME. This needs you to install the extension called “Remote Development by Microsoft” in your VS Code.\n\nJust save your settings and enjoy being totally advanced! 😎\n\nExamples\n\nIntelliJ IDEA on macOS\n\nTo open repository files in your Documents directory:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ \"editorIds\":[\"idea\"], \"projectPaths.default\":\"/Users/USERNAME/Documents\" } }\n\nJetBrains IDEs on Windows\n\nNote: We talk about IntelliJ here, but it’s similar for all JetBrains IDEs.\n\nThe idea:// protocol handler does not always work on Windows. If it fails for you, a workaround is to use IntelliJ’s built-in REST API to open files directly from a URL with some extra configuration steps.\n\nAdd this to your Sourcegraph User settings:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ ... \"jetbrains.forceApi\":\"builtInServer\" } }\n\nThen open IntelliJ settings, go to Build, Execution, Deployment | Debugger | Built-in Server, and enable Allow unsigned requests. This allows Sourcegraph to make requests to the built-in server, as stated in JetBrains’ docs.\n\nNote: with this workaround, “Open in Editor” will only work if your IDE is running.\n\nVS Code on macOS\n\nTo open repository files in your Documents directory:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ \"editorIds\":[\"vscode\"], \"projectPaths.default\":\"/Users/USERNAME/Documents\" } }\n\nVS Code on Windows\n\nTo open repository files in your Documents directory:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ \"editorIds\":[\"vscode\"], \"projectPaths.default\":\"C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\Documents\" } }\n\nVS Code on WSL\n\nTo open repository files in your Home directory:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ \"editorIds\":[\"vscode\"], \"projectPaths.default\":\"//wsl$/Ubuntu-18.04/home\" } }\n\nVS Code Insider on Mac\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ ... \"vscode.useInsiders\":true } }\n\nVS Code with different base paths configured for different platforms\n\nUses the assigned path for the detected Operating System when available:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ \"editorIds\":[\"vscode\"], // basePath is required as the default path when no Operating System is detected \"projectPaths.default\":\"/Users/USERNAME/Documents/\", \"projectPaths.windows\":\"/C:/Users/USERNAME/folder/\", \"projectPaths.mac\":\"/Users/USERNAME/folder/\", \"projectPaths.linux\":\"/home/USERNAME/folder/\" } }\n\nReplacement Example 1: Open Remote folders with VS Code on Mac by removing file names\n\nThis requires VS Code extension Remote Development by Microsoft to work.\n\nTo open directory where the repository files reside in a remote server:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ \"editorIds\":[\"custom\"], \"projectPaths.default\":\"/Users/USERNAME/Documents/\", // Replaces USER@HOSTNAME as appropriate. \"custom.urlPattern\":\"vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+USER@HOSTNAME%file\", //removes file name as the vscode-remote protocol handler only supports directory-opening \"replacements\":{\"\\/[^\\/]*$\":\"\"} } }\n\nReplacement Example 2: Add string to final file path\n\nAdds sourcegraph- in front of the string that matches the (?<=Documents\\/)(.*[\\\\\\/]) RegExp pattern, which is the string after Documents/ and before the final slash.\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ \"editorIds\":[\"vscode\"], \"projectPaths.default\":\"/Users/USERNAME/Documents/\", \"replacements\":{\"(?<=Documents\\/)(.*[\\\\\\/])\":\"sourcegraph-$1\"} // vscode://file//Users/USERNAME/Documents/REPO-NAME/package.json => vscode://file//Users/USERNAME/Documents/sourcegraph-REPO-NAME/package.json } }\n\nReplacement Example 3: Remove string from the final file path\n\nRemoves sourcegraph- from the final URL.\n\n{ \"openInEditor\":{ \"editorIds\":[\"vscode\"], \"projectPaths.default\":\"/Users/USERNAME/Documents/\", \"replacements\":{\"sourcegraph-\":\"\"} // vscode://file//Users/USERNAME/Documents/sourcegraph-REST-OF_REPO-NAME/package.json => vscode://file//Users/USERNAME/Documents/REST-OF_REPO-NAME/package.json } }",

      "# [Sourcegraph docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/analytics)\nAnalytics\n\nThe analytics section helps Sourcegraph administrators understand user engagement across the various Sourcegraph features, identify power users, and convey value to internal leaders. Introduced in version 3.42, the section includes analytics breakdowns for our most common features such as Batch Changes, Search Notebooks and search, while also providing basic user-level analytics.\n\nData Visualizations\n\nThe goal of these pages is to help administrators answer any question they might have about how features are being used within their Sourcegraph instance. So far, we have introduced pages for Search, Batch Changes, Code Intel, Search, and Search Notebooks, as well as a general users page.\n\nEach page can visualize the past one week, the past one month, or the path three months of data. For graphs that show user data, the graph can toggle between total users or unique users.\n\nThese graphs pull directly from the event log table within the Sourcegraph instance they are running. There should not be an increase to the storage on disk of these tables due to these new features. Further, no data beyond published ping data is sent back to Sourcegraph.\n\nValue Calculators\n\nEach page also includes a total time saved value which can be used to measure the value Sourcegraph is bringing to your organization. This metric is derived from the configurable calculators below the total time saved value. Each calculator multiplies event log data (ex: number of precise code intel events such as a go-to-definition) by a configurable number of minutes saved per event to arrive at a time saved by the feature.\n\nWe designed this to be configurable by you because we want to...\n\nhelp admins understand the value that is being seen by their organization today.\n\nbe customizable so admins can explore what changes will best increase developer time saved.\n\nThese calculators exist on the Search, Code Intel, Batch Changes, and Notebooks analytics pages. Each calculator looks different as they include metrics specifically designed for that part of the application. Please note that the calculator configuration does not save and will return to the default if you navigate away from the page.\n\nIf you have questions about how this works or about how to convey this value to leaders within your organization, please do not hesitate to reach out to your customer engineer.\n\nFAQ\n\nWho has access to see these improved analytics? Where can I find it?\n\nTo see these new visualizations, you must be a site admin. You can find these under Site Admin section, under the Analytics section of the left-nav bar.\n\nDo these improved analytics require sending data to Sourcegraph?\n\nNo! The processing happens entirely within a your instance so no data is sent in or out of your instance. Further, these improved analytics leverage data already being captured within the event log table of your instance so there is no additional storage or processing required for this change. Basically, customers should notice no perceivable difference to their infrastructure.\n\nHow often is the data updated?\n\nThe data is updated approximately every 24 hours.\n\nHow does this work with the existing usage stats page?\n\nThis new analytics experience has been redesigned from the ground up to provide the most value to administrators. In the future, we plan to deprecate the legacy usage stats page and statistics section once this functionality moved from experimental to generally available.",
      "# [Sourcegraph docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/postgres)\nPostgreSQL\n\nSourcegraph uses several PostgreSQL databases to support various functionality. These databases are:\n\npgsql or primary: responsible for user data and account information\n\ncodeintel-db: provides support for lsif data and part of the code-intelligence\n\ncodeinsights-db: provides support for code insights data\n\nVersion requirements\n\nWe support Postgres 16 and above. Older versions of Sourcegraph supported 12 see our Postgres 12 deprecation notice for more details.\n\nRole requirements\n\nThe user provided to Sourcegraph must have full access to the sg database and be able to create the following extensions:\n\nConfiguring PostgreSQL\n\nUpgrading Built-in PostgreSQL\n\nSourcegraph deployments come packaged with containers using the postgresql-16 image for pgsql and codeintel-db deployments and postgresql-16-codeinsights for codeinsights. These images contain an entryscript which will detect and upgrade Postgres instances at version 12 (our previous images Postgres version). See the (Postgres 12 end of life notice)[/admin/prostgres12_end_of_life_notice#] for more details.\n\nWARNING: Upgrading the PostgreSQL database requires stopping your Sourcegraph deployment which will result in downtime.\n\nAdditionally, once the upgrade process is started via the database container, interrupting the container before the upgrade is complete could result in corrupting the underlying Postgres database. We strongly advise taking a backup before the upgrade.\n\nThe PG_UPGRADE_EXTRA_ARGS env var can be set in the built-in postgresql-16 and postgresql-16-codeinsights deployments to provide extra arguments to the pg_upgrade command.\n\nSetting the env var PG_UPGRADE_EXTRA_ARGS=--link provides the --link option to the underlying pg_update; creating a hard links between the old and new data directories instead of copying data. This option is faster and requires less disk space, however if the database containers are interrupted during the upgrade process there is a strong possibility of data corruption. This can still be a viable choice for users who are confident in their container scheduling and backups and would like to avoid longer downtimes.\n\nIf not using the --link option, you will need enough disk space available for Postgres to make a copy of the existing data. For example, if your database is currently using 100GiB of storage, you will need an additional 100GiB free space in order for the upgrade process to succeed.\n\nUpgrading external PostgreSQL instances\n\nWhen running an external PostgreSQL instance, please do the following:\n\nBack up the Postgres DB so that you can restore to the old version should anything go wrong.\n\nTurn off Sourcegraph entirely (bring down all containers and pods so they cannot talk to Postgres.)\n\nUpgrade Postgres to the latest version following your provider's instruction or your preferred method:\n\nAWS RDS\n\nAWS Aurora\n\nGCP CloudSQL\n\nAzure DB\n\nHeroku\n\nEnterpriseDB\n\nCitus\n\nAiven PostgreSQL\n\nYour own PostgreSQL\n\nTurn Sourcegraph back on connecting to the now-upgraded database.\n\nWARNING: Do not allow Sourcegraph to run/connect to the new Postgres database until it has been fully populated with your data. Doing so could result in Sourcegraph trying to create e.g. a new DB schema and partially migrating. If this happens to you, restore from the backup you previously took or contact us ([email protected])\n\nSingle-container Sourcegraph",

      "# [Metrics and dashboards](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/observability/metrics)\nSourcegraph ships with Grafana for dashboards, Prometheus for metrics and alerting. We also provide built-in alerting for these metrics.\n\nGrafana\n\nSite admins can view the Grafana monitoring dashboards on a Sourcegraph instance:\n\nGo to User menu > Site admin.\n\nOpen the Monitoring page from the link in the left sidebar. The URL is https://sourcegraph.example.com/-/debug/grafana/.\n\nDashboards\n\nA complete dashboard reference is available for more context on our available service dashboards and panels.\n\nAdditional dashboards can also be set up—see Grafana configuration for more details.\n\nView documentation\n\nOn service dashboards, each metric panel has links attached that lead to relevant alert solutions or panel documentation. These can be accessed from the top left corner of each panel.\n\nView alerts\n\nThe Overview dashboard includes a high-level summary of alert events across all Sourcegraph services.\n\nOn service dashboards, a summary of alert events for that service is available. Alerts can be filtered by level using the \"Filter alert level\" selector at the top of the dashboard. This information can be overlaid on all panels in that dashboard by enabling the \"Alert events\" toggle.\n\nView version change events\n\nOn service dashboards, annotations can be displayed for occasions when a Sourcegraph version change is detected by enabling the \"Version changes\" toggle at the top of the dashboard. This can be useful for correlating metrics and alerts with Sourcegraph deployment and upgrade events.\n\nQuerying metrics\n\nSpecific metrics can be queried using Grafana's Explore panel, available at /-/debug/grafana/explore on your Sourcegraph instance. The query for each individual panel can be viewed and explored by clicking on the panel and using the \"Explore\" option.\n\nGrafana configuration\n\nSourcegraph deploys a customized image of Grafana, which ships with Sourcegraph-specific dashboard definitions.\n\nTo provide custom dashboards, a directory containing dashboard JSON specifications can be mounted in the Docker container at /sg_grafana_additional_dashboards. Changes to files in that directory will be detected automatically while Grafana is running.\n\nMore behavior can be controlled with environmental variables.\n\nNOTE: There is a known issue where attempting to edit anything using the Grafana UI will result in a 403 response with \"invalid CSRF token\". As a workaround, site admins can connect to Grafana directly to make changes using the Grafana UI.\n\nAccessing Grafana directly\n\nFor most use cases, you can access Grafana through your Sourcegraph instance. Follow the instructions below to access Grafana directly to, for example, edit configuration directly.\n\nNOTE: Most of the dashboards that Sourcegraph ships with are not configurable through the Grafana UI. In general, we recommend these configuration methods instead.\n\nIf you are using the Kubernetes deployment option, you can access Grafana directly using Kubernetes port forwarding to your local machine:\n\nGrafana will be available http://localhost:3370/-/debug/grafana.\n\nIf you are using Docker Single Container or the Docker Compose deployment option, Grafana is available locally at http://localhost:3370/-/debug/grafana without any additional setup. If Sourcegraph is deployed to a remote server, then access via an SSH tunnel using a tool such as sshuttle is required to establish a secure connection to Grafana. To access the remote server using sshuttle from your local machine:\n\nGrafana will be available at http://host:3370/-/debug/grafana.\n\nGrafana security\n\nTo enable Grafana's built-in authentication, add GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED as false in the Grafana container's environment variables in your deployment override file, then redeploy the Grafana container.\n\nWe also recommend that you customize the default admin username and password.\n\nFor new deployments, configure the GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER and GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variables on the Grafana container, using your deployment pipeline's secrets management tool, before initial deployment, to initialize the default admin user on first deployment.\n\nFor existing deployments, you can either log in to the Grafana web UI with the default credentials and it will prompt you to change the password, or you can reinitialize Grafana:\n\nExport any customized dashboards via JSON (if applicable)\n\nConfigure the environment variables the same as a new instance\n\nDelete the Grafana container's storage volume\n\nRedeploy the Grafana container\n\nImport any customized dashboards (if applicable)\n\nThe contents of the Grafana container's storage volume are ephemeral, so metrics data is not lost in this process.\n\nPrometheus\n\nPrometheus is a monitoring tool that collects application- and system-level metrics over time and makes these accessible through a robust query language.\n\nFor most use cases, you can query Prometheus through Grafana using Grafana's Explore panel, available at /-/debug/grafana/explore on your Sourcegraph instance, or simply rely on the dashboards we ship.\n\nAvailable metrics\n\nHigh-level alerting metrics\n\nSourcegraph's metrics include a single high-level metric alert_count which indicates the number of level=critical and level=warning alerts each service has fired over time for each Sourcegraph service. This is the same metric presented on the Overview Grafana dashboard.\n\nNOTE: We provide built-in alerting for these alerting metrics to help monitor the health of your Sourcegraph instance. Refer to our alert solutions reference for details on specific alerts.\n\nDescription: The number of alerts each service has fired for a given alert name and severity level.\n\nValues: Although the values of alert_count are floating-point numbers, only their whole numbers have meaning. For example, 0.5 and 0.7 indicate no alerts are firing, while 1.2 indicates exactly one alert is firing and 3.0 indicates exactly three alerts firing.\n\nLabels:\n\nComplete reference\n\nA complete reference of Sourcegraph's vast set of Prometheus metrics is not yet available. If you are interested in this, please reach out by filing an issue or contacting us at [email protected].\n\nPrometheus configuration\n\nSourcegraph runs a customized image of Prometheus, which packages a standard Prometheus installation together with rules files and target files tailored to Sourcegraph and quality-of-life integrations such as the ability to configure alerting from the Sourcegraph web application.\n\nA directory can be mounted at /sg_prometheus_add_ons. It can contain additional config files of two types:\n\nrule files which must have the suffix _rules.yml in their filename (ie gitserver_rules.yml)\n\ntarget files which must have the suffix _targets.yml in their filename (ie local_targets.yml)\n\nRule files and target files must use the latest Prometheus 2.x syntax.\n\nThe environment variable PROMETHEUS_ADDITIONAL_FLAGS can be used to pass on additional flags to the prometheus executable running in the container.\n\nAccessing Prometheus directly\n\nMost of the time, Sourcegraph site admins will monitor and query key metrics through Grafana, rather than through Prometheus directly. Grafana also provides the dashboards that monitor the standard metrics that indicate the health of the instance. Follow the instructions below to access Prometheus directly instead.\n\nIf you are using the Kubernetes deployment option, port-forward the Prometheus service:\n\nIf you are using Docker Single Container or the Docker Compose deployment option, you will need to restart the Sourcegraph container with a flag --publish 9090:9090 in the docker run command.\n\nPrometheus will be available http://localhost:9090.\n\nUsing a custom monitoring system",

      "# [LLM Model Configuration](https://5.6.sourcegraph.com/cody/clients/model-configuration)\nThis guide will walk you through the steps to customize the LLM models available from your Sourcegraph Enterprise instance.\n\nCody Enterprise can be configured using one of two methods:\n\n\"Completions\" Configuration\n\nModel Configuration (Early Access Program)\n\n\"Completions\" Configuration\n\nSetting up Cody Enterprise\n\nYou can set up Cody for your Enterprise instance in one of the following ways:\n\nSelf-hosted Sourcegraph\n\nSourcegraph Cloud\n\nCody on self-hosted Sourcegraph Enterprise\n\nPrerequisites\n\nYou have Sourcegraph version 5.1.0 or above\n\nA Sourcegraph Enterprise subscription with Cody Gateway access or an account with a third-party LLM provider\n\nEnable Cody on your Sourcegraph instance\n\nCody uses one or more third-party LLM (Large Language Model) providers. Make sure you review Cody's usage and privacy notice. Code snippets are sent to a third-party language model provider when you use the Cody extension.\n\nThis requires site-admin privileges. To do so,\n\nFirst, configure your desired LLM provider either by Using Sourcegraph Cody Gateway (recommended) or Using a third-party LLM provider directly\n\nNext, go to Site admin > Site configuration (/site-admin/configuration) on your instance and set:\n\nCody is now fully enabled on your self-hosted Sourcegraph enterprise instance!\n\nCody on Sourcegraph Cloud\n\nWith Sourcegraph Cloud, you get Cody as a managed service, and you do not need to enable Cody as is required for self-hosted setup\n\nHowever, by contacting your account manager, Cody can still be enabled on-demand on your Sourcegraph instance. The Sourcegraph team will refer to the handbook\n\nNext, you can configure the VS Code extension by following the same steps as mentioned for the self-hosted environment\n\nAfter which, you are all set to use Cody with Sourcegraph Cloud\n\nLearn more about running Cody on Sourcegraph Cloud.\n\nDisable Cody\n\nTo turn Cody off:\n\nGo to Site admin > Site configuration (/site-admin/configuration) on your instance and set:\n\nNext, remove completions configuration if they exist\n\nEnable Cody only for some users\n\nTo enable Cody only for some users, for example, when rolling out a Cody POC, follow all the steps mentioned in Enabling Cody on your Sourcegraph instance. Then, do the following:\n\nSourcegraph 5.3+\n\nIn Sourcegraph 5.3+, access to Cody is managed via user roles. By default, all users have access.\n\nFirst, ensure Cody is enabled in your site configuration. Go to Site admin > Site configuration (/site-admin/configuration) on your instance and set:\n\nNext, go to Site admin > Users & Auth > Roles (/site-admin/roles) on your instance. On that page, you can:\n\nControl whether users by default have access to Cody (expand User [System] and toggle Cody > Access as desired)\n\nControl whether groups of users have access to Cody (+Create role and enable the Cody > Access toggle as desired)\n\nSourcegraph 5.2 and earlier\n\nIn Sourcegraph 5.2 and earlier, you should use the feature flag cody to turn Cody on selectively for some users. To do so:\n\nGo to Site admin > Site configuration (/site-admin/configuration) on your instance and set:\n\nNext, go to Site admin > Feature flags (/site-admin/feature-flags)\n\nAdd a feature flag called cody\n\nSelect the boolean type and set it to false\n\nOnce added, click on the feature flag and use add overrides to pick users that will have access to Cody\n\nSupported models and model providers\n\nCody Enterprise supports many models and model providers. You can configure Cody Enterprise to access models via Sourcegraph Cody Gateway or directly using your own model provider account or infrastructure.\n\nUsing Sourcegraph Cody Gateway:\n\nRecommended for most organizations.\n\nSupports state-of-the-art models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and more, without needing a separate account or incurring separate charges.\n\nUsing your organization's account with a model provider:\n\nUse your organization's Anthropic account\n\nUse your organization's OpenAI account\n\nUsing your organization's public cloud infrastructure:\n\nUse Amazon Bedrock (AWS)\n\nUse Azure OpenAI Service\n\nUse Vertex AI on Google Cloud (coming soon)\n\nUse your organization's Anthropic account\n\nFirst, create your own key with Anthropic. Once you have the key, go to Site admin > Site configuration (/site-admin/configuration) on your instance and set:\n\nUse your organization's OpenAI account\n\nFirst, create your own key with OpenAI. Once you have the key, go to Site admin > Site configuration (/site-admin/configuration) on your instance and set:\n\nLearn more about OpenAI models.\n\nUse Amazon Bedrock (AWS)\n\nYou can use Anthropic Claude models on Amazon Bedrock.\n\nFirst, make sure you can access Amazon Bedrock. Then, request access to the Anthropic Claude models in Bedrock. This may take some time to provision.\n\nNext, create an IAM user with programmatic access in your AWS account. Depending on your AWS setup, different ways may be required to provide access. All completion requests are made from the frontend service, so this service needs to be able to access AWS. You can use instance role bindings or directly configure the IAM user credentials in the configuration. Additionally, the AWS_REGION environment variable will need to be set in the frontend container for scoping the IAM credentials to the AWS region hosting the Bedrock endpoint.\n\nOnce ready, go to Site admin > Site configuration (/site-admin/configuration) on your instance and set:\n\nFor the chatModel and completionModel fields, see Amazon's Bedrock documentation for an up-to-date list of supported model IDs, and cross reference against Sourcegraph's supported LLM list to verify compatibility with Cody.\n\nFor endpoint, you can either:\n\nFor Pay-as-you-go, set it to an AWS region code (e.g., us-west-2) when using a public Amazon Bedrock endpoint\n\nFor Provisioned Throughput, set it to the provisioned VPC endpoint for the bedrock-runtime API (e.g., \"https://vpce-0a10b2345cd67e89f-abc0defg.bedrock-runtime.us-west-2.vpce.amazonaws.com\")\n\nFor accessToken, you can either:\n\nLeave it empty and rely on instance role bindings or other AWS configurations in the frontend service\n\nSet it to <ACCESS_KEY_ID>:<SECRET_ACCESS_KEY> if directly configuring the credentials\n\nSet it to <ACCESS_KEY_ID>:<SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>:<SESSION_TOKEN> if a session token is also required\n\nUsing GCP Vertex AI\n\nRight now, We only support Anthropic Claude models on GCP Vertex.\n\nEnable the Vertex AI API in the GCP console. Once Vertex has been enabled in your project, navigate to the Vertex Model Garden to select & enable the Anthropic Claude model(s) which you wish to use with Cody. See Supported LLM Models for an up-to-date list of Anthropic Claude models supported by Cody.\n\nCreate a Service Account:\n\nCreate a service account.\n\nAssign the Vertex AI User role to the service account.\n\nGenerate a JSON key for the service account and download it.\n\nConvert JSON Key to Base64 by doing:\n\nOnce ready, go to Site admin > Site configuration (/site-admin/configuration) on your instance and set:\n\nFor the Endpoint, you can\n\nNavigate to the Documentation Page: Go to the Claude 3 Haiku Documentation on the GCP Console Model garden\n\nLocate the Example: if you scroll enough through the page to find the example that shows how to use the cURL command with the Claude 3 Haiku model. The example will include a sample request JSON body and the necessary endpoint URL. Copy the URL in the site-admin config: The endpoint URL will look something like this: https://LOCATION-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/publishers/anthropic/models/\n\nExample URL: https://us-east5-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/sourcegraph-vertex-staging/locations/us-east5/publishers/anthropic/models\n\nUse Azure OpenAI Service\n\nCreate a project in the Azure OpenAI Service portal. Go to Keys and Endpoint from the project overview and get one of the keys on that page and the endpoint.\n\nNext, under Model deployments, click \"manage deployments\" and ensure you deploy the models you want, for example, gpt-35-turbo. Take note of the deployment name.\n\nOnce done, go to Site admin > Site configuration (/site-admin/configuration) on your instance and set:\n\nFor the access token, you can either:\n\nAs of 5.2.4 the access token can be left empty and it will rely on Environmental, Workload Identity or Managed Identity credentials configured for the frontend and worker services\n\nSet it to <API_KEY> if directly configuring the credentials using the API key specified in the Azure portal\n\nUse StarCoder for Autocomplete\n\nWhen tested with other coder models for the autocomplete use case, StarCoder offered significant improvements in quality and latency compared to our control groups for users on Sourcegraph.com. You can read more about the improvements in our October 2023 release notes and the GA release notes.\n\nTo ensure a fast and reliable experience, we are partnering with Fireworks and have set up a dedicated hardware deployment for our Enterprise users. Sourcegraph supports StarCoder using the Cody Gateway.\n\nTo enable StarCoder go to Site admin > Site configuration (/site-admin/configuration) and change the completionModel:\n\nUsers of the Cody Extensions will automatically pick up this change when connected to your Enterprise instance.\n\nModel Configuration\n\nSourcegraph v5.6.0 or later supports the ability to choose between different LLM models, allowing developers to use the best model for Cody Chat as needed. This is accomplished exposing much more flexible configuration options for Cody when using Sourcegraph Enterprise. The newer style of configuration is described next. However, you can still use the Older style \"Completions\" Configuration.\n\nQuickstart\n\nThe simplest way to configure your Sourcegraph Enterprise would be to add the following configuration section to your instance's site configuration:\n\nThe \"modelConfiguration\" section defines which LLM models are supported by the Sourcegraph instance, and how to invoke them. The \"sourcegraph\" section defines how Sourcegraph-supplied LLM models should be configured. (That is, LLM models made available by the Cody Gateway service.) The default settings will expose all current Cody Gateway models from your Sourcegraph instance, and make them available to users.\n\nHowever, if you are seeking more control and wish to restrict which LLM models are available, or if you wish to use your own API access key, you can expand upon the \"modelConfiguration\" section as needed.\n\nConcepts\n\nThe LLM models available for use from a Sourcegraph Enterprise instance are the union of \"Sourcegraph-supplied models\" and any custom models providers that you explicitly add to your Sourcegraph instance's site configuration. For most administrators, just relying on Sourcegraph-supplied models will ensure that you are using quality models without needing to worry about the specifics.\n\nSourcegraph-supplied Models\n\nThe Sourcegraph-supplied models are those that are available from Cody Gateway, and your site configuration controls which of those models can be used.\n\nIf you wish to not use any Sourcegraph-supplied models, and instead only rely on those you have explicitly defined in your site configuration, you can set the \"sourcegraph\" field to null.\n\nThere are three top-level settings for configuring Sourcegraph-supplied LLM models:\n\nModel Filters\n\nThe \"modelFilters\" section is how you restrict which Cody Gateway models are made available to your Sourcegraph Enterprise instance's users.\n\nThe first field is the \"statusFilter\". Each LLM model is given a label by Sourcegraph as per its release, such as \"stable\", beta\", or \"experimental\". By default, all models available on Cody Gateway are exposed. Using the category filter ensures that only models with a particular category are made available to your users.\n\nThe \"allow\" and \"deny\" fields, are arrays of model references for what models should or should not be included. These values accept wild cards.\n\nThe following examples illustrate how to use all these settings in conjunction:\n\nDefault Models\n\nThe \"modelConfiguration\" setting also contains a \"defaultModels\" field that allows you to specify the LLM model used depending on the situation. If no default is specified, or refers to a model that isn't found, it will silently fallback to a suitable alternative.\n\nThe format of these strings is a \"Model Reference\", which is a format for uniquely identifying each LLM model exposed from your Sourcegraph instance.\n\nAdvanced Configuration\n\nFor most administrators, relying on the LLM models made available by Cody Gateway is sufficient. However, if even more customization is required, you can configure your own LLM providers and models.\n\nOverview\n\nThe \"modelConfiguration\" section exposes two fields \"providerOverrides\" and \"modelOverrides\". These may override any Sourcegraph-supplied data, or simply introduce new ones entirely.\n\nProvider Configuration\n\nA \"provider\" is a way to organize LLM models. Typically a provider would be referring to the company that produced the model. Or the specific API/service being used to access the model. But conceptually, it's just a namespace.\n\nBy defining a provider override in your Sourcegraph site configuration, you are introducing a new namespace to contain models. Or customize the existing provider namespace supplied by Sourcegraph. (e.g. all \"anthropic\" models.)\n\nThe following configuration shippet defines a single provider override with the ID \"anthropic\".\n\nServer-side Configuration\n\nThe most important part of a provider's configuration is the \"serverSideConfig\" field. That defines how the LLM model's should be invoked, i.e. which external service or API will be called to serve LLM requests.\n\nIn the example, the \"type\" field was \"anthropic\". Meaning that any interactions using the \"anthropic\" provider would be sent directly to Anthropic, at the supplied endpoint URL using the given accessToken.\n\nHowever, Sourcegraph supports several different types of LLM API providers natively. The current set of supported LLM API providers is:\n\nModel Configuration\n\nWith a provider defined, we can now specify custom models using that provider by adding them to the \"modelOverrides\" section.\n\nModel Reference\n\nThe following configuration snippet defines a custom model, using the \"anthropic\" provider from the previous example.\n\nMost of the configuration fields are self-explanatory, such as labeling the model's category (\"stable\", \"beta\") or category (\"accuracy\", \"speed\"). The more important fields are described below:\n\nmodelRef. Each model is given a unique identifier, referred to as a model reference or \"mref\". This is a string of the form ${providerId}::${apiVersionId}::${modelId}.\n\nIn order to associate a model with your provider, the ${providerId} must match. The ${modelId} can be almost any URL-safe string.\n\nThe ${apiVersionId} is required in order to detect compatibility issues between newer models and Sourcegraph instances. In the following example, the string \"2023-06-01\" is used to clarify that this LLM model should formulate API requests using that version of the Anthropic API. If you are unsure, when defining your own models you can leave this as \"unknown\".\n\ncontextWindow. The context window is the number of \"tokens\" sent to an LLM. Either in the amount of contextual data sent in the LLM prompt (e.g. the question, relevant snippets, etc.) and the maximum size of the output allowed in the response. These values directly control factors such as the time it takes to respond to a prompt and the cost of the LLM request. And each LLM model or provider may have their own limits as well.\n\nmodelName. The model name, is the value required by the LLM model's API provider. In this example, the modelRef defined the model's ID as claude-3-sonnet but the modelName was the more specific \"claude-3-sonnet-20240229\".\n\ncapabilities. The capabilities of a model determine which situations the model can be used. For example, models only supported for \"autocomplete\" will not be available for Cody chats.\n\nIt's recommended that every instance admin not using a third-party LLM provider makes this change and we are planning to make this the default in a future release.",

To answer your question:\n\n- You get the IDE features on your codehost. So you can find references inside of a pull request/etc.\n\n- You don't need to have a checkout / switch branches (can be costly depending on your dev env / dev scale)\n\n- We focus on cross repository tools. IDEs are usually work within a project context.\n\nPersonally I use the text search a _lot_, even though I could just use my editor. This is mainly due to it being a browser search shortcut + the more expressive search syntax + nicer UI for browsing/reading code.\n\n#### Comment ID e70ou53 with +10 score by [(alexthelyon, Reddit, 2018-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9kmr4p/sourcegraph_is_now_open_source/e70ou53/) (in reply to ID e70nbpf):\nAny plans to support gitlab?

And every single symbol (variable name, method/fn name, class name, constant, etc.) is linked to all references to that symbol. So e.g. you can just click any class or method and see every single usage of that class or method or constant across the entire codebase (every single google project, every single dependency, every single language, etc....). Its also tied in with our build system (internally called blaze or externally called bazel), so you can e.g. load proto file in the browser and then see all generated sources from that file (like the Java, js, c++, or python class from protoc) even though they don't actually exist on disk.\n\nMostly it's the search that is amazing, e.g.\n\nhttps://cs.opensource.google/search?q=lang:java%20OutputStream%20-f:Test%20&ss=protobuf%2Fprotobuf\n\nCode search exposes predicates that show understandings of the language. e.g. you can avoid matching string in a code comment but using the \"usage:\" predicate.\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/code-search/reference\n\nThe tools scale so that a single project can easily have thousands of files and large teams (100s of SWEs) can remotely collaborate efficiently.\n\nWe also have our code review tool, internally called critique. That exposes it's own search indices for searching all (un)submitted changes, e.g. search all changes from Jan 1 to Feb 3, on files matching .*Foo.java, with change text \"bar\", under path a/b/c. This really helps bisecting regressions.\n\nHonestly, the tooling makes me 10x more efficient than I am otherwise on my own.\n\n## Comment ID i01in3p with +1 score by [(quetejodas, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i01in3p/) (in reply to ID tahdd2):\nAgent Ransack\n\n## Comment ID i01m72n with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i01m72n/) (in reply to ID tahdd2):\nMost of it I do in VSCode and IDE but sometimes I use Meld for change detection and the good old `find -iname` plus a ton of either bash or half-baked Python.\n\n## Comment ID i01n3ws with +1 score by [(Isvara, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i01n3ws/) (in reply to ID tahdd2):\nhttps://elixir.bootlin.com/\n\n## Comment ID i01xvoc with +1 score by [(pancakeQueue, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i01xvoc/) (in reply to ID tahdd2):\nThe VSCode extension GitLens is fantastic.

      "# Post ID 1ftt6sf: Sourcebot, an open-source Sourcegraph alternative with +63 score by [(lowpolydreaming, Reddit, 2024-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1ftt6sf/sourcebot_an_opensource_sourcegraph_alternative/)\nHi, we’re Brendan and Michael, the creators of Sourcebot ([https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot)). Sourcebot is an open-source code search tool that allows you to quickly search across many large codebases. Check out our demo video here: [https://youtu.be/mrIFYSB\\_1F4](https://youtu.be/mrIFYSB_1F4), or try it for yourself here on our demo site: [https://demo.sourcebot.dev](https://demo.sourcebot.dev)\n\nWhile at prior roles, we’ve both felt the pain of searching across hundreds of multi-million line codebases. Using local tools like grep were ill-suited since you often only had a handful of codebases checked out at a time. [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/) solves this issue by indexing a collection of codebases in the background and exposing a web-based search interface. It is the de-facto search solution for medium to large orgs, but is often cited as expensive ($49 per user / month) and recently went [closed source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41296481). That’s why we built Sourcebot.\n\nWe designed Sourcebot to be:\n\n* **Easily deployed:** we provide a single, self-contained [Docker image](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/pkgs/container/sourcebot).\n* **Fast & scalable:** designed to minimize search times (current average is \\~73ms) across many large repositories.\n* **Cross code-host support:** we currently support syncing public & private repositories in GitHub and GitLab.\n* **Quality UI:** we like to think that a good looking dev-tool is more pleasant to use.\n* **Open source:** Sourcebot is free to use by anyone.\n\nUnder the hood, we use [Zoekt](https://github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt) as our code search engine, which was originally authored by Han-Wen Nienhuys and now [maintained by Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/sourcegraph-accepting-zoekt-maintainership). Zoekt works by building a trigram index from the source code enabling extremely fast regular expression matching. Russ Cox has a great [article](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html) on how trigram indexes work if you’re interested.\n\nIn the shorter-term, there are several improvements we want to make, like:\n\n* Improving how we communicate indexing progress (this is currently non-existent so it’s not obvious how long things will take)\n* UX improvements like search history, query syntax highlighting & suggestions, etc.\n* Small QOL improvements like bookmarking code snippets.\n* Support for more code hosts (e.g., BitBucket, SourceForge, ADO, etc.)\n\nIn the longer-term, we want to investigate how we could go beyond just traditional code search by leveraging machine learning to enable experiences like semantic code search (“where is system X located?”) and code explanations (”how does system X interact with system Y?”). You could think of this as a copilot being embedded into Sourcebot. Our hunch is that will be useful to devs, especially when packaged with the traditional code search, but let us know what you think.\n\nGive it a try: [https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot).

      "# Post ID 1c659cl: Has anyone tried using Sourcegraph's SCIP to develop a language server? with +3 score by [(son_of_Gib, Reddit, 2024-04-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/1c659cl/has_anyone_tried_using_sourcegraphs_scip_to/)\nI'm trying to develop platform independent language servers for my coding copilot so i don't have to depend on vscode's default language server APIs. I've tried using tree-sitter to find references, go to definition, and they work to an extent but fails with variable references and cannot differentiate constructors and functions. I did some research (idk if i did enough but I'm exhausted at not finding a solution) and found [SCIP](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/announcing-scip). Its an alternative to LSIF but I have no idea how to use it. It has a Protobuf schema explaining the way it creates the index.scip file that contains all the basic symbol information like references and definition but i have no idea how to even extract this information and use it. \n\nI'm a student doing this as a project and i really hit a roadblock here. Would really appreciate some help on this.\n\nAlso, are there any open-source language servers that i can use?\n\n## Comment ID l00pz1p with +7 score by [(olafurpg, Reddit, 2024-04-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/1c659cl/has_anyone_tried_using_sourcegraphs_scip_to/l00pz1p/) (in reply to ID 1c659cl):\nAuthor of SCIP here. I’m sorry if this comment is a bit all over the place, I’m sitting in my kids room waiting for my 8wo twins to fall asleep. \n\nIt’s true that there are no high level guides on how to extract or work with SCIP. It takes a bit of practice to work with the data, understand how to process symbols and run all of this efficiently. If you overcome this barrier, it opens up a ton of doors for building useful language agnostic developer tooling.\n\nSCIP standalone is not sufficient to implement a language server but it can be a helpful component of a language server. The Scala language server, Metals, uses SemanticDB which is effectively the same thing as SCIP. You can take a look at the Metals codebase for inspiration if you’re familiar with Scala. For example, here’s one blog post explaining the approach to implement fast “find references” with SemanticDB symbols http://scalameta.org/metals/blog/2019/01/22/bloom-filters.\n\nMetals uses heavily the Scala presentation compiler to support low-latency interactions that wouldn’t be possible with a batch indexer like the SCIP indexers you’ve seen. However, deep inside the interactions with the presentation compiler, Metals converts compiler symbols into SemanticDB symbol to lookup stuff from an index (generated by batch indexers). If you’re building a non-trivial application with SCIP then it’s inevitable that you’ll end up using tricks like that.\n\nEvery developer tool ends up having different needs (performance, language coverage, features, memory usage, disk footprint, runtime, …) making it difficult to support off-the-shelf library APIs to work with SCIP data. The total number of devtools authors who are interested in using this data is also so small making it difficult to justify the investment in providing off-the-shelf solutions.\n\n### Comment ID l09dyfr with +3 score by [(son_of_Gib, Reddit, 2024-04-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/1c659cl/has_anyone_tried_using_sourcegraphs_scip_to/l09dyfr/) (in reply to ID l00pz1p):\nCongrats on the twins!!\n\nAlso I've never worked on Scala but this is an interesting read.

Quickly find docs + examples for stdlib functions, or functions anywhere on GitHub. For example: [Python re.compile](https://sourcegraph.com/hg.python.org/cpython/symbols/python/Lib/re/compile), [Go (*bytes.Buffer).Write](https://sourcegraph.com/code.google.com/p/go/symbols/go/code.google.com/p/go/src/pkg/bytes/Buffer:type/Write), and [JavaScript Lo-Dash map function](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/lodash/lodash/symbols/javascript/lodash.js/global/_/map)\n\n2. See where your code is used, and who uses it. For example: [sourcegraph.com/kr](https://sourcegraph.com/kr) or sourcegraph.com/$YOUR_GITHUB_LOGIN\n\n3. See the most-used functions in a repository to get a sense of best practices and idioms. For example: [Python Flask top functions](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/mitsuhiko/flask), [Go stdlib top functions](https://sourcegraph.com/code.google.com/p/go), and [Ruby core top functions](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/ruby/ruby)\n\nAnd variations of the above. We're in beta, so please send feedback/bug reports to https://twitter.com/srcgraph or https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph.com/issues.\n\nWe want to make something super useful for programmers like you all (and us), so let us know how we can improve.\n\n### Comment ID cdrsnbn with +1 score by [(kgashok, Reddit, 2013-12-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1rh1yq/sourcegraph/cdrsnbn/) (in reply to ID cdn6x54):\nWhat is the !bang for sourcegraph search from duckduckgo.com?

The last interview I had with them was pretty conversational.  I had a background in some of the problems they were working on and during the conversation I brought up a sort of improvement/trick I had figured out in the past and the interviewer said it was something they had never considered before and seemed really interested in it which I thought was a good sign.  But unfortunately they ghosted me after that.  But here's the crazy part.  Sourcegraph has some open source repos and out of curiosity I decided to look at one the other day.  I looked at a few of the recent PRs and one of them caught my eye.  The PR was the EXACT improvement/trick that I brought up in my interview.

However, there are a couple of things to consider. First, people throw out ideas all the time. If your interviewer got a way to improve the code base from you, there’s no reason to not make that improvement. It’s not like you’re there to make it yourself. They’re not going to let their product remain suboptimal for no reason. Second, they most likely had no input into whether you were ghosted; that’s on your recruiter. Third, just because you had a good idea doesn’t mean you were a good candidate overall. \n\nIt sucks, but it is what it is.\n\n### Comment ID kpheo4p with +14 score by [(purpleappletrees, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1aliiqb/name_shame_sourcegraph/kpheo4p/) (in reply to ID kpffsk5):\nYeah the only thing that sucks here is that OP was ghosted.\n\n## Comment ID kpfbhmw with +73 score by [(connerfitzgerald, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1aliiqb/name_shame_sourcegraph/kpfbhmw/) (in reply to ID 1aliiqb):\nTag Steve Yegge on Twitter, he'll give a shit about this\n\n### Comment ID kphtmho with +3 score by [(esq_esq_esq, Reddit, 2024-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1aliiqb/name_shame_sourcegraph/kphtmho/) (in reply to ID kpfbhmw):\nHas it impacted his ego?

Cody (from Sourcegraph) provides an interface that let's you choose from any of 3.5 Sonnet (default), 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4o and Mixtral 8x22B among others. You can freely switch among them on a prompt by prompt basis.\n\nThe interface supports chats, inline prompting, and autocomplete suggestions. About the only downside I've encountered so far is that it limits the conversation context to 15K tokens + 45K tokens from source files you reference with the prompt and the output is limited to 4k tokens per query.\n\nI got curious about Claude Projects after running into those limits in a very long chat with 3.5 Sonnet. Cody is clever about windowing the chat, I only discovered it when asking Sonnet to fill in some specific details in a summary outline of the chat and it admitted it no longer had access to them.  Other than that, 3.5 Sonnet + Cody + VSCode has been truly transformative for my projects - and it's only $9 per month.\n\nSo for very long chats, I'm just now experimenting with Projects. I'm wondering what it can do better than Cody to justify continuing my $20/month subscription.\n\n(note: I have absolutely no personal or financial affiliation with either product)\n\n## Comment ID lhfzl03 with +12 score by [(pegunless, Reddit, 2024-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1eou6cj/claude_project_vs_cody/lhfzl03/) (in reply to ID 1eou6cj):\nSourcegraph marketing folks are getting pretty shameless with the advertising here.

I use Cody when I reach my limit on the Claude Pro. In general I've found Claude Pro is more willing to offer extensive answers and to work hard. Cody seems to be programmed to keep it brief (which is understandable as they are paying for the expensive API). So, when I use Cody I find myself focusing on smaller tasks, and I have the big thinking and broader coding talks for Claude Pro. I do use Claude Sonnet 3.5 through Cody, so I still find it very intelligent and capable, just not as willing to do long outputs or deeper thinking.",

Selecting files with the @ command is tedious and can't be copy/pasted, why can't we just add all open files, or select from the filetree? \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/36hxlpd.png\n\nWhy would adding the current repo to the context only add a select few files? Or none; I started a new chat, added the repo to the context, and got back \"I would have to see the files to give you an answer\".\n\nIn late 2024 I expected way way better, but this is WILDLY unintuitive and very frustrating.\n\n## Comment ID lrynk11 with +3 score by [(ado__dev, Reddit, 2024-10-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sourcegraph/comments/1g3u1xh/its_not_good/lrynk11/) (in reply to ID 1g3u1xh):\nHey, thank you so much for the feedback. My name is Ado and I work on the DevRel team at Sourcegraph and would love to help. \n\nCan you confirm which version of Cody you are using? (The latest is 1.38 for VS Code, if you are running an older version, can you update to latest and see if you are still seeing similar issues?)\n\nIt's interesting to me that in the screenshot you provided that even though you specified the list of files to use as context, Cody went ahead and added additional ones (the .cpp ones), this should not happen unless you specify the entire repo as context, so this seems like a bug on our end. \n\nGreat feedback on adding all open files or selecting from a file tree, we are looking at options to support a better and easier way of adding files for context. By default the entire repo is added when you open a new chat.\n\n## Comment ID ltq4owq with +2 score by [(DryCycle5044, Reddit, 2024-10-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sourcegraph/comments/1g3u1xh/its_not_good/ltq4owq/) (in reply to ID 1g3u1xh):\nHi zarmin, well i have found a way around this, you can create a command (through the cody interface) that puts all openTabs as context, I have found this very helpfull (if it doesn't work at the first try, open the json settings of the user commands and manually change the 'openTabs' field to 'true', that worked for me)\n\n### Comment ID lzgtqp6 with +1 score by [(Cibolin_Star_Monkey, Reddit, 2024-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sourcegraph/comments/1g3u1xh/its_not_good/lzgtqp6/) (in reply to ID ltq4owq):\nAmazing!

For instance, in Point #3, you mention that enterprise contracts help offset costs, but when those VC funds or contracts dry up, the landscape could change drastically.\n\nIt’s the “startup mentality” of being okay with burning money now, but that approach may not hold long term. Companies offering specialty services (like Perplexity with search, or you guys with code completion) alongside the API seem to be on more solid ground because they’re offering clear value propositions.\n\nAlso, it seems like the real strategy is to pull users in with promises of unlimited access, only to either upsell them to higher-tier packages later or throttle the context and response quality to a point where it’s proficient for the company but at the user’s expense. This trade-off, where users are enticed by unlimited access only to be constrained by reduced context windows or quality over time, doesn’t create a sustainable or fair experience for the majority of users.\n\nConvincing users that they can get unlimited API access for a flat rate doesn’t seem sustainable. If 50% of your users started consuming resources at the rate of the top 5%, it would quickly strain your model. And that’s essentially the promise you’re making by offering these unlimited packages. I think users should be focusing on specialized services rather than expecting truly unlimited access to APIs, which just isn’t feasible at scale.\n\n## Comment ID lmnfg57 with +3 score by [(TyreseGibson, Reddit, 2024-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1fefju4/unlimited_messages_to_claude_3_opus_sounds_to/lmnfg57/) (in reply to ID 1fefju4):\nInteresting!

Since then, there has been no sense of safety or longevity. You clock in each day with the idea that it could be your last.\n\nThe smartest leaders were shown the door, and the ones that kept their jobs were the loyalists to the exec suite's ideas, no matter how weak or deranged. The exec suite thought it was a good idea to change what we sold and for how much every few months, then berated teams for not hitting quota (which was next to impossible when there was no direction). \n\nThis environment quickly spiraled in to the Hunger Games. Exec meetings became tense and the ICs felt the trickle down as managers threw their own people under the bus. The calibration cycle almost a year ago was incredibly brutal, built solely on an agenda to make as many top performers quit as possible to save some cash. \n\nWhat used to make this place worthwhile (location-agnostic pay, work-life balance) doesn't exist anymore. Instead, you'll join a company that gets off on backstabbing, steamrolling, and punishment. The bad managers do nothing but gaslight and indulge in toxicity with their direct reports. They play favorites and if you're not in the \"in\" club, you'll be shown the pink slip soon enough. The ones that \"succeed\" here are the \"yes\" men (and yes, it is mostly men since DEI isn't a priority anymore) and the ones that are willing to put their health, mental state, and/or personal life on the line in order to get ahead for a company that will quickly lose the AI race to any number of stronger giants. Working late nights and weekends is the rule, not the exception, but they'll lead with their \"work from anywhere\" culture in interviews to make it seem reasonable. \n\nIt does not matter if you've been successful at Sourcegraph or have hit your goals consistently quarter after quarter. If they decide that they don't like you, you'll be gaslit, punished, and eventually pushed to leave.\n\nThey hire some of the smartest people that I've ever met, but they abuse them to the point that the best friends I made at Sourcegraph were due to trauma bonding together.",

As a company, we have ambitious goals, and there’s room for everyone to step up, own business-critical projects, and have a voice in tackling complex challenges. There really aren’t any barriers to entry. You’re much more likely to be pushed outside your comfort zone than to ever feel like you’re stuck working on things that aren’t important and don’t challenge you (and who wants that?). Expectations are high, but you get the support that you need when you ask for it. People are always happy to help, and everyone I’ve worked with here–from the exec team to managers to ICs–is really nice, and really smart. I’m constantly inspired by my colleagues. Regardless of their level, everyone feels accessible. I really appreciate the flexibility to work when it makes the most sense for me. So long as I’m delivering high quality work and am able to collaborate effectively, nobody really cares when I’m at my desk. And I feel comfortable taking time off to reset when I need it.",

Too high a premium is placed on being technically excellent, but you also need to work as a team toward a common goal of making a great product even better. Backfill the exec team! SteveY only cares about the technical side of things but seems to be calling all the shots. Take a serious look in the mirror - did recent opt-out opportunities actually move Sourcegraph toward the culture you want to create? Do you even know what that culture is? Why were opt-outs in prod/engineering disproportionately female relative to the rest of prod/engineering? Define the culture you actual want, and why, and make decisions accordingly. The company is far too directionless, which is a real shame because the product is awesome. Who are you? Who do you want to be? How will you get there? Continue to be fully transparent with new hires about the challenges and opportunities. Obviously the recent spike in reviews tells you company culture change is happening and acknowledged internally - how will you position that to candidates?",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "Sourcegraph is making a conscious effort to change it's culture by encouraging people to be \"scrappy,\" operate in ambiguity, and by discouraging \"Entitlement\" to information about company direction, and the \"why\" behind decisions. Within this change in culture, there exists great opportunity for individuals who are looking for opportunities to make big impact and advance quickly in their careers by taking on a ton of responsibility. This is a founder-led organization, where the founders expect everyone to give as much time and effort possible to Sourcegraph - they are understandably completely invested in the product and expect the same of Teammates. You will be expected to embrace The Grind of start up life.. You will feel like you have to be responsive at all times because \"asynchronous\" culture results in a lot of evening, weekend, and holiday work (BTW many roles are pulled into tons of meetings). It's important to understand what \"be flexible\" means in the context of a lot of these reviews - be ready for quick changes in direction, because there is a serious lack of commitment to long-term plans. The 30 day minimum PTO requirement is great, in theory, but not enforced or monitored in any way. Lastly, despite being a high performer (and rewarded as such), I felt this was a place where the consequences of making a mistake were high, particularly when interacting with senior leadership. I witnessed individuals very abruptly go from being valued contributors to sidelined. Most top performers do not have families, and those who do have a partner that does care taking. Ask questions during the interview process about what's important to you - you will get straightforward answers from most hiring managers. Know that \"scrappy\" is code for working a lot, \"high performance culture\" means taking direction well, and being \"flexible\" equates to frequently changing direction or doing things very last-minute based on arbitrary deadlines.",

          "pros": "Compensation is good. Generally speaking, transparency is a lived value. They are doing remote work the right way, with 2x per year company meet ups in awesome locations, a generous office set up stipend, a cell phone/internet stipend, and reimbursement for co-working space. Depending on your team, the PTO policy is good (depending on role, expect to check in on slack/email/get texts on occasion while on vacation, though). There is a huge opportunity here for people willing to devote a ton of their lives to work - and leadership is making intentional steps to foster that environment. The handbook is awesome, and internal processes are documented well, although it can be information overload. The company uses Slack heavily (a pro, in my book, provided you are comfortable with wading through large amounts of information and being tagged in tons of CYA-type posts). I did not appreciate the culture shift that happened after I joined, where leadership doesn't care about people who were good at their jobs choosing to leave, so I left quickly myself. I'm great at what I do and therefore do not need to work for a company that doesn't value good management, promotes competition between team members, and doesn't respect work/life boundaries. But, on the flip side, I learned a TON and had the opportunity to work on a lot of cool stuff - that's why this is in the pros. Also, most of the people I worked with were genuinely awesome. Sourcegraph does know how to hire great people. I loved how international the team is - so cool to work with people from all over on a near-daily basis.",

However, we are seeing big gaps in culture generally as well as non-engineering teams like marketing, product, and dev experience. We need good, experienced leaders in there ASAP that will be trusted and respected and listened to and seen as equals to the engineering department. We can't keep losing good people because they aren't being supported in doing things outside the limited POV of what is correct according to leadership and outspoken senior developers.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "- There's a lot of potential for things to go super well but any new employee beware that things are really chaotic right now. But if you're looking for a young start-up trying to figure things out, great! Just know that things do NOT feel like a mature start-up (yet) even though there's Series D funding and Sourcegraph has been around for 10 years. - If you're not a more senior engineer (and in some cases Sales), it's hard to make an impact and do good work. Lots of really smart people have left because their expertise was dismissed, especially true of the product, marketing, design, and dev/customer experience teams where we continue to see high turnover. Leadership will continually say that these people have left because of some issue like low performance or culture misfit when really theses super talented people tried many times to make an impact but were stalled at every turn. Not only does it make me distrust leadership it also makes me feel like if I struggle to succeed, it will always be my fault alone and leadership won't do any self-reflection or support me. Case in point, a lot of these recent 5 star reviews seem to be a little fake to me... You can't necessarily trust what they say... And maybe leadership is creating them to cover up more critical problems... - There is favoritism. And the small group making product decisions at this time is a group of senior white men, mostly outspoken developers. If you don't think and communicate in exactly the way that this group does, you won't be listened to at this time and/or will have to put in triple or sometimes even quadruple the effort just to be listened to and trusted. Caveat here is that we've completely changed how we do work in mid-December so need to make some big decisions fast. That means that this isn't necessarily the time to listen to other points of view so we can move fast. But based on my experience working here through multiple pivots in the past year or so, I worry that it will never be a good time to listen to others... And following a strategy of only listening to the loudest in the room who can come up with an idea the fastest isn't always good business. - Leadership constantly changes direction, causing whiplash, and uses the excuse that \"this is a start-up\" to cover up the fact that it really feels like leadership doesn't knows what they're doing. This also affects your work--expect to not do the work listed in the original job posting within a month. - Culture is ambiguous at this time. A lot of people were drawn to the culture originally but, especially with lots of turnover and recent leadership changes, culture is really up in the air with no one committing to maintaining it. I don't necessarily think this is a bad thing per se but just be aware that the culture described in the handbook is not necessarily what it is now. It is in flux and leadership says they are working on it. The handbook itself has been falling behind and is a mix of up to date and out of date content. At this time, it feels like there is no culture besides the people running the show pushing things forward at all costs. This has led to stress, communication struggles, and a few toxic interactions for the entire company to see. If you interview, make sure to ask lots of questions from employees and leadership about culture, impact, expectations, etc. to make sure that it is a good fit for you. - One thing I was excited about was pay transparency and role levelling that came out a few months ago. I felt that was a good first step towards mapping out a career trajectory here at Sourcegraph. With all the changes and the pivots, I feel as if I haven't moved forward in terms of my career goals as I try to keep up with changes every other week. I'm focused more on figuring out how to best support leadership and teammates with the new plan of the week instead of just doing good work. I'm worried that this is having a negative effect on my career growth.",

Layoffs are a common occurrence as well, with several having occurred in the past year- not all of them related to the economy either. Things have been on a downward trajectory, and with the hiring of new senior leadership, we are now headed over a cliff. The culture has done a complete 180 in the past few months. It has gone from great, to ok, to I-don’t-believe-what-I’m-hearing/seeing in record time. Gone are the days where employees felt they could speak up or disagree without being shamed or berated. You can tell that the few remaining leaders are more inclined to just go along with what upper leadership wants, simply out of fear. Attrition is high. Backfills are nil. People leave and their reasoning is different than what senior leadership then tells you. Most of leadership has turned over in the past few months. Do more with less is the prevailing sentiment. People are being required to do things WAY outside their job scope, or else be managed out. There is constant talk of how things work at Amazon or google. Many current employees even left those places to escape the toxic cultures that are now being touted as supreme… and inevitable. Diversity is severely neglected. Senior leadership does not value the opinions but of a few select people, which is clear by public communications. This is has gone from a wonderful people focused company to a truly chaotic at best, and soul crushing at worst, place to work.",

One major detail I can add is that in a conversation with a customer who actively liked Sourcegraph, he admitted the product was basically a vitamin and not a painkiller. In his words, he'd freak out if his CMS went down but not if Sourcegraph went down. You don't want to work for a company whose core product, even amongst its biggest fans, is a \"nice to have.\"",

Recruiters will sell you on what an awesome place Sourcegraph is.

They're totally out of touch and will just sell you on the high base salary and cool perks. Don't be fooled.",

If I had something important to discuss with my manager and a zoom was more appropriate, sometimes my manager would insist I send a slack. My manager would then take time to critique my slack message with suggestions on how I could shorten it in the future. \r\n\r\n* Half-hearted attempt at diversity: There is a real desire to foster DEI as part of the culture, but I never felt like it was really executed on while I was there. There were things they did well (hiring across the world &amp; pay equity) but also lot of areas where it fell short.\r\n\r\n Examples of how it fell short: Very clique-ish culture. A primarily white/male dominated environment when I was there, in particular, most of the managers and leaders were white and/or male. Their recruiting team is not diverse, which is odd to me if you're making a push to hire for diversity. There was no official DEI group or any ERGs to create community. There was no pay transparency between departments and roles. \r\n\r\n* Leadership is inexperienced and communication from them could be better Leaders, as individuals, were some of the most talented people i've ever met, but in leadership roles they couldn't seem to make a cohesive decision or if they did, it felt like they made it too late...always felt like we were a little behind the curve. \r\n\r\nExample: Leaders tried really hard to differentiate themselves from Github through numerous pivots and tangential ideas but never seemed to quite pull it off. I'm not surprised they have now chosen the *brilliant* idea to pivot into the ai coding assistant space, once again putting it in a struggle against Github's robust and impressively developed Copilot. \r\n\r\nA lot of these pivots were made to try to gain traction somewhere, anywhere, and in my opinion is partially due to a disconnect between product and engineering. It seemed like the PMs had constant uphill battles leading to a revolving door of PMs coming and going. This is also evident with the marketing department. While I was there it felt like those departments were never set up for success.",

There has been a lot of change this year. Partially due to the downturn and partially due to a change in leadership. Large scale changes are always hard and when it is coupled with the worst economic environment in over a decade, things have been tough but improving. The leadership changes were a must and I feel like we've really 'up-leveled' the exec team (as our CEO has said) and think we have better people in place to lead us across Eng, Product, Sales, and People. The leadership team is also young / new to positions of power / authority and and have made some big mistakes.

That's the thing that matters most, because it makes up for a lot of pain associated with growing and scaling. Due to a combination of crazy tech funding over the last 2 - 3 years and our leadership's ability to assembling one of the most impressive boards (a16z, Sequoia, Craft, Redpoint, and a few others), we secured 125M+ in Series D funding. As a result, we have incredibly high cash reserves that allows us to stay focused on building for the long-term and not having to make short-sighted decisions just to stay alive in the short-term. We are still investing in our business, we are still growing in areas that show strong returns, and I feel like if / when you can prove out an MVP you can and will get support from leadership in the form of budget and head count. We have still faced our own cuts (more on that below), but where there is momentum there is support. We are transparent. Probably to a fault. I honestly find it a little scary that I know everything about our business. All of our finances, our spending, our revenue growth is publicly available for anyone and everyone at the company. Not only that, our head of finance / ops regularly talks about our head count plans, what our forecasting numbers will look like and what will happen if we don't meet targets. I genuinely love working with most of the people at this company. Lots of eager, smart, and genuinely customer-oriented people that just want to make our customers happy. Comp is pretty great. Our handbook has a stated goal to pay everyone at 75% of their job band so we pay, by definition, above market (this isn't always clean but I rarely hear anyone complain about their compensation). This also comes with high expectations that we hire great talent and pay for it. There is pressure there that isn't for everyone.",

The team across the board is full of self-starters who aren't afraid to share their ideas, and the lack of red tape means things get done quickly. Even though the past year has been insanely tough for mostly everyone in tech (and the exec team undoubtedly had to make some extremely hard decisions that they told us about with as much transparency as possible at every step), I have no doubt that Sourcegraph is going to come out on top. I've personally learned and grown more here than anywhere else I've worked before, and I couldn't be happier. If you're up for a challenge and want to be a part of something special, then Sourcegraph is definitely a place that I'd recommend.",

While your GitHub commit rate is impressive, delegating this task to your development team might be more beneficial. With the company at a crucial stage, your time and expertise could be more impactful in addressing strategic issues and steering the company towards success.\n\nFor the CTO: The key to great software development lies in a strong, well-supported team. Reflecting on the consistent feedback in these reviews could be enlightening. This introspection may help fine-tune your leadership approach, enhancing team dynamics and contributing positively to Sourcegraph’s trajectory.\n\nTo the ever-evolving leadership team at Sourcegraph: As you navigate your new roles, be mindful that job security has been a recurring challenge within the company. It's crucial not to take any outcomes personally. Numerous highly skilled predecessors have faced similar situations. Stay positive but honest, give it your best, and remember that the outcome is more about the company's ongoing dynamics than a measure of your individual talents. Wishing you the best of luck in your endeavors.",

          "cons": "I wanted to share some real talk about my time at Sourcegraph, especially since you might be considering a role there. It's always good to go in with both eyes open, right?\n\nThe work environment at Sourcegraph isn't just a mixed bag; it presents considerable challenges. They've made a strategic pivot recently, but that's only part of the story. The leadership team has been completely overhauled multiple times in just two years. It's tough to have any confidence in the longevity of the current leadership when you've seen their predecessors shown the door one after the other. Initially, these changes brought a sense of hope, but by the third round, it's hard not to feel a bit sorry for the new leaders who are trying their best - just like the last ones did.\n\nRegarding the executive team, to put it simply, they lack experience. There's a palpable sense of internal strife, almost like they're participants in their own version of the Hunger Games, each afraid of being the next to go. This atmosphere of uncertainty doesn't lead to outright micromanagement, but something perhaps more frustrating. Often, you'll receive vague directives like \"make it better\" without clear guidance on what that actually means. If you dare to ask for clarification, you risk being labeled as entitled. And remember, how you interpret and act on these vague instructions will come back around in your impact reviews, which I'll get into a bit more later.\n\nJob security is a significant concern. Layoffs have become a recurring theme, not just an occasional blip. It's happened several times over the last two years alone. With the management structure in constant flux, you never really feel settled. It's like standing on shifting sands, always unsure of where you stand or who you'll report to next or if they will even be left around by the next review cycle.\n\nNow, let's talk about the impact reviews. Sourcegraph has been around for a decade, so they're far from a startup. The real issue is that they're struggling to find a way to significantly increase revenue to finally IPO. The CEO and CTO seem to be out of fresh ideas, so there's this pressure on employees to come up with million-dollar ideas - or to “make it better” 😉. If you don't come up with something that substantially boosts the bottom line, you're labeled as not making an impact, putting you at risk of being in the next round of layoffs which always seem to be just around the corner. Even if you do come up with a great idea, it gets absorbed by the top brass, and then it's back to square one - you need another big idea, increase your commit rate (which gets judged at impact reviews) or go back to helping endless new hires, new management, and customer success team navigate a tech stack that's been left hollow by the departure of the many skilled devs that owned them but have left due to layoffs or attrition and hope that they perceive those efforts as impactful.\n\nIn short, while there are some perks like fair pay, the overall environment is fraught with peril, from unstable leadership and job insecurity to a high-pressure culture around million dollar feature ideas. It's a lot to take on, and I just wanted you to know what you might be getting into.\n\nWishing you the best in your job search and career. Take care!",

          "cons": "Sourcegraph, a decade old company, has regressed to pre-product market fit after a recent strategic and product pivot. The new flagship product lacks significant differentiated from an equivalent Microsoft product with greater distribution and comparatively infinite runway.\n\nThe majority (if not all) of the exec team is working in their largest role, and those making decisions have very little experience working in teams they do not control with absolute power. Execs have opposing goals for the company and have continuously failed to build a team that they can or are willing to place their trust in. They will micromanage down to the IC level, and spend focus on controlling things like \"woke DEI culture\" at the expense of addressing key business challenges.\n\nCommunication is majorly problematic. PeopleOps and Communications teams find themselves frequently deleting or damage-controlling messages from executives. These messages undermine morale (sometimes punching-down to particular ICs) and create unnecessary panic, sometimes involving self-aggrandizing narratives against the board. The phrase \"Psychological safety was a zero-interest rate phenomenon\" became emblematic of the company culture, especially following the first round of layoffs.\n\nThese layoffs have been a recurring theme, with at least four separate instances over the past year alone. The engineering leadership's contradictory characterizations of the individual contributors (ICs) as simultaneously 'entitled', 'under-performing', 'mis-skilled', yet 'world-class' reflect a deep-seated misalignment. This misalignment is further exacerbated by the leadership's demand for unquestioned adherence to an opaque strategy, where any attempt at seeking clarity is viewed as dissent.\n\nThe organizational structure has seen dramatic shifts. Initially, a layer of engineering directors was removed for their slow decision-making in an environment of impossible contradictory goals. More recently, a wave of new directors and department heads, predominantly from Google, were brought in, treating this Series D startup as if it operated with the culture and resources of a FAANG company. Despite these extensive changes, tangible improvements in engineering or product development haven't seemed to develop.\n\nCompounding these challenges is the absence of managers focused primarily on people management within the engineering organization. Every manager is also an individual contributor, creating a situation where managers are overburdened with dual responsibilities. This has led to a rapid turnover in management roles, with several individual contributors taking on managerial positions and reverting within a year, leaving a few with disproportionately large teams to manage.\n\nRecent calibration was particularly brutal. There is a recurring pattern of shifting goal posts and large pivots coming from left-field, and at impact review time everyone's previous quarter worth of work is judged on the vibes-du-jour instead of the goals that were set when action taking place. You can be set a goal by a one exec, then at calibration time be punished for achieving this goal by a different exec who retroactively disagrees with the goal (or was unaware of the goal, or disagreed but kept feedback to themselves until it grew to resentment).",

Things have been on a downward trajectory, and with the hiring of new senior leadership, we are now headed over a cliff. The culture has done a complete 180 in the past few months. It has gone from great, to ok, to I-don’t-believe-what-I’m-hearing/seeing in record time. Gone are the days where employees felt they could speak up or disagree without being shamed or berated. You can tell that the few remaining leaders are more inclined to just go along with what upper leadership wants, simply out of fear. Attrition is high. Backfills are nil. People leave and their reasoning is different than what senior leadership then tells you. Most of leadership has turned over in the past few months. Do more with less is the prevailing sentiment. People are being required to do things WAY outside their job scope, or else be managed out. There is constant talk of how things work at Amazon or google. Many current employees even left those places to escape the toxic cultures that are now being touted as supreme… and inevitable. Diversity is severely neglected. Senior leadership does not value the opinions but of a few select people, which is clear by public communications.

Large scale changes are always hard and when it is coupled with the worst economic environment in over a decade, things have been tough but improving. The leadership changes were a must and I feel like we've really 'up-leveled' the exec team (as our CEO has said) and think we have better people in place to lead us across Eng, Product, Sales, and People.

As a result, we have incredibly high cash reserves that allows us to stay focused on building for the long-term and not having to make short-sighted decisions just to stay alive in the short-term. We are still investing in our business, we are still growing in areas that show strong returns, and I feel like if / when you can prove out an MVP you can and will get support from leadership in the form of budget and head count. We have still faced our own cuts (more on that below), but where there is momentum there is support. We are transparent. Probably to a fault. I honestly find it a little scary that I know everything about our business. All of our finances, our spending, our revenue growth is publicly available for anyone and everyone at the company. Not only that, our head of finance / ops regularly talks about our head count plans, what our forecasting numbers will look like and what will happen if we don't meet targets. I genuinely love working with most of the people at this company. Lots of eager, smart, and genuinely customer-oriented people that just want to make our customers happy. Comp is pretty great. Our handbook has a stated goal to pay everyone at 75% of their job band so we pay, by definition, above market (this isn't always clean but I rarely hear anyone complain about their compensation).

We need good, experienced leaders in there ASAP that will be trusted and respected and listened to and seen as equals to the engineering department. We can't keep losing good people because they aren't being supported in doing things outside the limited POV of what is correct according to leadership and outspoken senior developers.",
        "cons": "- There's a lot of potential for things to go super well but any new employee beware that things are really chaotic right now. But if you're looking for a young start-up trying to figure things out, great! Just know that things do NOT feel like a mature start-up (yet) even though there's Series D funding and Sourcegraph has been around for 10 years. - If you're not a more senior engineer (and in some cases Sales), it's hard to make an impact and do good work. Lots of really smart people have left because their expertise was dismissed, especially true of the product, marketing, design, and dev/customer experience teams where we continue to see high turnover. Leadership will continually say that these people have left because of some issue like low performance or culture misfit when really theses super talented people tried many times to make an impact but were stalled at every turn. Not only does it make me distrust leadership it also makes me feel like if I struggle to succeed, it will always be my fault alone and leadership won't do any self-reflection or support me. Case in point, a lot of these recent 5 star reviews seem to be a little fake to me... You can't necessarily trust what they say... And maybe leadership is creating them to cover up more critical problems... - There is favoritism. And the small group making product decisions at this time is a group of senior white men, mostly outspoken developers. If you don't think and communicate in exactly the way that this group does, you won't be listened to at this time and/or will have to put in triple or sometimes even quadruple the effort just to be listened to and trusted. Caveat here is that we've completely changed how we do work in mid-December so need to make some big decisions fast. That means that this isn't necessarily the time to listen to other points of view so we can move fast. But based on my experience working here through multiple pivots in the past year or so, I worry that it will never be a good time to listen to others... And following a strategy of only listening to the loudest in the room who can come up with an idea the fastest isn't always good business. - Leadership constantly changes direction, causing whiplash, and uses the excuse that \"this is a start-up\" to cover up the fact that it really feels like leadership doesn't knows what they're doing. This also affects your work--expect to not do the work listed in the original job posting within a month. - Culture is ambiguous at this time. A lot of people were drawn to the culture originally but, especially with lots of turnover and recent leadership changes, culture is really up in the air with no one committing to maintaining it. I don't necessarily think this is a bad thing per se but just be aware that the culture described in the handbook is not necessarily what it is now. It is in flux and leadership says they are working on it. The handbook itself has been falling behind and is a mix of up to date and out of date content. At this time, it feels like there is no culture besides the people running the show pushing things forward at all costs. This has led to stress, communication struggles, and a few toxic interactions for the entire company to see. If you interview, make sure to ask lots of questions from employees and leadership about culture, impact, expectations, etc. to make sure that it is a good fit for you. - One thing I was excited about was pay transparency and role levelling that came out a few months ago. I felt that was a good first step towards mapping out a career trajectory here at Sourcegraph. With all the changes and the pivots, I feel as if I haven't moved forward in terms of my career goals as I try to keep up with changes every other week. I'm focused more on figuring out how to best support leadership and teammates with the new plan of the week instead of just doing good work. I'm worried that this is having a negative effect on my career growth.",

Why were opt-outs in prod/engineering disproportionately female relative to the rest of prod/engineering? Define the culture you actual want, and why, and make decisions accordingly. The company is far too directionless, which is a real shame because the product is awesome. Who are you? Who do you want to be? How will you get there?

        "cons": "Sourcegraph is making a conscious effort to change it's culture by encouraging people to be \"scrappy,\" operate in ambiguity, and by discouraging \"Entitlement\" to information about company direction, and the \"why\" behind decisions. Within this change in culture, there exists great opportunity for individuals who are looking for opportunities to make big impact and advance quickly in their careers by taking on a ton of responsibility. This is a founder-led organization, where the founders expect everyone to give as much time and effort possible to Sourcegraph - they are understandably completely invested in the product and expect the same of Teammates. You will be expected to embrace The Grind of start up life.. You will feel like you have to be responsive at all times because \"asynchronous\" culture results in a lot of evening, weekend, and holiday work (BTW many roles are pulled into tons of meetings). It's important to understand what \"be flexible\" means in the context of a lot of these reviews - be ready for quick changes in direction, because there is a serious lack of commitment to long-term plans. The 30 day minimum PTO requirement is great, in theory, but not enforced or monitored in any way. Lastly, despite being a high performer (and rewarded as such), I felt this was a place where the consequences of making a mistake were high, particularly when interacting with senior leadership. I witnessed individuals very abruptly go from being valued contributors to sidelined. Most top performers do not have families, and those who do have a partner that does care taking. Ask questions during the interview process about what's important to you - you will get straightforward answers from most hiring managers. Know that \"scrappy\" is code for working a lot, \"high performance culture\" means taking direction well, and being \"flexible\" equates to frequently changing direction or doing things very last-minute based on arbitrary deadlines.",

There is a huge opportunity here for people willing to devote a ton of their lives to work - and leadership is making intentional steps to foster that environment. The handbook is awesome, and internal processes are documented well, although it can be information overload. The company uses Slack heavily (a pro, in my book, provided you are comfortable with wading through large amounts of information and being tagged in tons of CYA-type posts). I did not appreciate the culture shift that happened after I joined, where leadership doesn't care about people who were good at their jobs choosing to leave, so I left quickly myself. I'm great at what I do and therefore do not need to work for a company that doesn't value good management, promotes competition between team members, and doesn't respect work/life boundaries.

If I had something important to discuss with my manager and a zoom was more appropriate, sometimes my manager would insist I send a slack. My manager would then take time to critique my slack message with suggestions on how I could shorten it in the future. \r\n\r\n* Half-hearted attempt at diversity: There is a real desire to foster DEI as part of the culture, but I never felt like it was really executed on while I was there. There were things they did well (hiring across the world &amp; pay equity) but also lot of areas where it fell short.\r\n\r\n Examples of how it fell short: Very clique-ish culture. A primarily white/male dominated environment when I was there, in particular, most of the managers and leaders were white and/or male. Their recruiting team is not diverse, which is odd to me if you're making a push to hire for diversity. There was no official DEI group or any ERGs to create community. There was no pay transparency between departments and roles. \r\n\r\n* Leadership is inexperienced and communication from them could be better Leaders, as individuals, were some of the most talented people i've ever met, but in leadership roles they couldn't seem to make a cohesive decision or if they did, it felt like they made it too late...always felt like we were a little behind the curve. \r\n\r\nExample: Leaders tried really hard to differentiate themselves from Github through numerous pivots and tangential ideas but never seemed to quite pull it off. I'm not surprised they have now chosen the *brilliant* idea to pivot into the ai coding assistant space, once again putting it in a struggle against Github's robust and impressively developed Copilot. \r\n\r\nA lot of these pivots were made to try to gain traction somewhere, anywhere, and in my opinion is partially due to a disconnect between product and engineering. It seemed like the PMs had constant uphill battles leading to a revolving door of PMs coming and going. This is also evident with the marketing department.

        "cons": "Sourcegraph, a decade old company, has regressed to pre-product market fit after a recent strategic and product pivot. The new flagship product lacks significant differentiated from an equivalent Microsoft product with greater distribution and comparatively infinite runway.\n\nThe majority (if not all) of the exec team is working in their largest role, and those making decisions have very little experience working in teams they do not control with absolute power. Execs have opposing goals for the company and have continuously failed to build a team that they can or are willing to place their trust in. They will micromanage down to the IC level, and spend focus on controlling things like \"woke DEI culture\" at the expense of addressing key business challenges.\n\nCommunication is majorly problematic. PeopleOps and Communications teams find themselves frequently deleting or damage-controlling messages from executives. These messages undermine morale (sometimes punching-down to particular ICs) and create unnecessary panic, sometimes involving self-aggrandizing narratives against the board. The phrase \"Psychological safety was a zero-interest rate phenomenon\" became emblematic of the company culture, especially following the first round of layoffs.\n\nThese layoffs have been a recurring theme, with at least four separate instances over the past year alone. The engineering leadership's contradictory characterizations of the individual contributors (ICs) as simultaneously 'entitled', 'under-performing', 'mis-skilled', yet 'world-class' reflect a deep-seated misalignment. This misalignment is further exacerbated by the leadership's demand for unquestioned adherence to an opaque strategy, where any attempt at seeking clarity is viewed as dissent.\n\nThe organizational structure has seen dramatic shifts. Initially, a layer of engineering directors was removed for their slow decision-making in an environment of impossible contradictory goals. More recently, a wave of new directors and department heads, predominantly from Google, were brought in, treating this Series D startup as if it operated with the culture and resources of a FAANG company. Despite these extensive changes, tangible improvements in engineering or product development haven't seemed to develop.\n\nCompounding these challenges is the absence of managers focused primarily on people management within the engineering organization. Every manager is also an individual contributor, creating a situation where managers are overburdened with dual responsibilities. This has led to a rapid turnover in management roles, with several individual contributors taking on managerial positions and reverting within a year, leaving a few with disproportionately large teams to manage.\n\nRecent calibration was particularly brutal. There is a recurring pattern of shifting goal posts and large pivots coming from left-field, and at impact review time everyone's previous quarter worth of work is judged on the vibes-du-jour instead of the goals that were set when action taking place. You can be set a goal by a one exec, then at calibration time be punished for achieving this goal by a different exec who retroactively disagrees with the goal (or was unaware of the goal, or disagreed but kept feedback to themselves until it grew to resentment).",

The culture around impact reviews tends to undermine the practicality of the unlimited PTO policy. Additionally, while the new executive's awareness of cultural issues is a positive step, the depth and complexity of these problems make significant improvements challenging.",

With the company at a crucial stage, your time and expertise could be more impactful in addressing strategic issues and steering the company towards success.\n\nFor the CTO: The key to great software development lies in a strong, well-supported team. Reflecting on the consistent feedback in these reviews could be enlightening. This introspection may help fine-tune your leadership approach, enhancing team dynamics and contributing positively to Sourcegraph’s trajectory.\n\nTo the ever-evolving leadership team at Sourcegraph: As you navigate your new roles, be mindful that job security has been a recurring challenge within the company. It's crucial not to take any outcomes personally. Numerous highly skilled predecessors have faced similar situations. Stay positive but honest, give it your best, and remember that the outcome is more about the company's ongoing dynamics than a measure of your individual talents.

        "cons": "I wanted to share some real talk about my time at Sourcegraph, especially since you might be considering a role there. It's always good to go in with both eyes open, right?\n\nThe work environment at Sourcegraph isn't just a mixed bag; it presents considerable challenges. They've made a strategic pivot recently, but that's only part of the story. The leadership team has been completely overhauled multiple times in just two years. It's tough to have any confidence in the longevity of the current leadership when you've seen their predecessors shown the door one after the other. Initially, these changes brought a sense of hope, but by the third round, it's hard not to feel a bit sorry for the new leaders who are trying their best - just like the last ones did.\n\nRegarding the executive team, to put it simply, they lack experience. There's a palpable sense of internal strife, almost like they're participants in their own version of the Hunger Games, each afraid of being the next to go. This atmosphere of uncertainty doesn't lead to outright micromanagement, but something perhaps more frustrating. Often, you'll receive vague directives like \"make it better\" without clear guidance on what that actually means. If you dare to ask for clarification, you risk being labeled as entitled. And remember, how you interpret and act on these vague instructions will come back around in your impact reviews, which I'll get into a bit more later.\n\nJob security is a significant concern. Layoffs have become a recurring theme, not just an occasional blip. It's happened several times over the last two years alone. With the management structure in constant flux, you never really feel settled. It's like standing on shifting sands, always unsure of where you stand or who you'll report to next or if they will even be left around by the next review cycle.\n\nNow, let's talk about the impact reviews. Sourcegraph has been around for a decade, so they're far from a startup. The real issue is that they're struggling to find a way to significantly increase revenue to finally IPO. The CEO and CTO seem to be out of fresh ideas, so there's this pressure on employees to come up with million-dollar ideas - or to “make it better” 😉. If you don't come up with something that substantially boosts the bottom line, you're labeled as not making an impact, putting you at risk of being in the next round of layoffs which always seem to be just around the corner. Even if you do come up with a great idea, it gets absorbed by the top brass, and then it's back to square one - you need another big idea, increase your commit rate (which gets judged at impact reviews) or go back to helping endless new hires, new management, and customer success team navigate a tech stack that's been left hollow by the departure of the many skilled devs that owned them but have left due to layoffs or attrition and hope that they perceive those efforts as impactful.\n\nIn short, while there are some perks like fair pay, the overall environment is fraught with peril, from unstable leadership and job insecurity to a high-pressure culture around million dollar feature ideas. It's a lot to take on, and I just wanted you to know what you might be getting into.\n\nWishing you the best in your job search and career. Take care!",

        "cons": "There was a big layoff in mid 2022, and since then, this place has been on a rapid decline. DEI was done away with quickly, and benefits began getting pulled left and right. Since then, there has been no sense of safety or longevity. You clock in each day with the idea that it could be your last.\n\nThe smartest leaders were shown the door, and the ones that kept their jobs were the loyalists to the exec suite's ideas, no matter how weak or deranged. The exec suite thought it was a good idea to change what we sold and for how much every few months, then berated teams for not hitting quota (which was next to impossible when there was no direction). \n\nThis environment quickly spiraled in to the Hunger Games. Exec meetings became tense and the ICs felt the trickle down as managers threw their own people under the bus. The calibration cycle almost a year ago was incredibly brutal, built solely on an agenda to make as many top performers quit as possible to save some cash. \n\nWhat used to make this place worthwhile (location-agnostic pay, work-life balance) doesn't exist anymore. Instead, you'll join a company that gets off on backstabbing, steamrolling, and punishment. The bad managers do nothing but gaslight and indulge in toxicity with their direct reports. They play favorites and if you're not in the \"in\" club, you'll be shown the pink slip soon enough. The ones that \"succeed\" here are the \"yes\" men (and yes, it is mostly men since DEI isn't a priority anymore) and the ones that are willing to put their health, mental state, and/or personal life on the line in order to get ahead for a company that will quickly lose the AI race to any number of stronger giants. Working late nights and weekends is the rule, not the exception, but they'll lead with their \"work from anywhere\" culture in interviews to make it seem reasonable. \n\nIt does not matter if you've been successful at Sourcegraph or have hit your goals consistently quarter after quarter. If they decide that they don't like you, you'll be gaslit, punished, and eventually pushed to leave.\n\nThey hire some of the smartest people that I've ever met, but they abuse them to the point that the best friends I made at Sourcegraph were due to trauma bonding together.",

      "# [The Death of the Junior Developer on 2024-06-24](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/the-death-of-the-junior-developer)\nWarning: This blog post is somewhat speculative; the sky might not be falling. But my spidey-sense is definitely tingling. The way we are all doing our jobs in software is changing, potentially in big ways. So let's think of this as a thought exercise.\n\nWith that disclaimer, we're off!\n\nI have been chatting with a bunch of both junior and senior developer-type folk at different companies lately. By cross-barfticulating these conversations I've picked up on an emerging new pattern, which is that like 80% of you are way smarter than me. My goodness. What have I been doing?\n\nBut also another pattern, which is that a lot of people picked a bad year to be a junior developer. A whole lot of people. I wouldn't want to be just getting started in the industry today.\n\nNot just the computer industry. Any industry. It's a bad year to be a junior anything.\n\nMy wife Linh and I are huge horror-movie buffs. So, to reflect the somber theme of today's rant, I will use horror movie titles to introduce our sections.\n\nLet's start by talking about what's happening to junior developers.\n\nThe Purge (2013)\n\nOur first story of the day is about a law firm and has nothing to do with programming. But it is indeed centrally relevant to the crisis that is just starting to loom ominously, as crises love to do. My buddy Gene Kim gave me permission to share this story about his friend who is a managing partner at a 50-person law firm.\n\nIn short, one might surmise that all hell is breaking loose at said law firm because of ChatGPT, with some wondering whether the entire structure of their firm, which has been stable for a very long time, might now be completely wrong. Their whole comp structure, pensions, succession planning, everything is going through an existential crisis due to a frigging chatbot.\n\nThe problem, you see, is that there could be a future where they don't need junior associates anymore.\n\nIncreasingly, they need only senior associates, who (a) describe the tasks to be done; i.e., create the prompts, and (b) review the resulting work for accuracy and correctness. The high-end LLMs do so well with tasks normally fielded by junior associate lawyers, that there isn't much room left for the real junior associates on payroll.\n\nThe LLM can produce research, summaries, briefs, contracts, memos, pleadings, petitions – anything they need. All the documents it creates are \"perfect\"… with the catch that if someone senior doesn't double check its work before a judge sees it you might wind up in jail or something.\n\nCatching the LLM in a hallucination, catching a junior associate in a mistake – pretty similar. Really just two options for generating the same output. Except one of those options is fast and tireless and essentially free. And the other one puked on the chocolate fountain at the holiday party.\n\nWhew. You picked a bad year to be a junior associate lawyer, that's for damn sure. Sorry, graduating class of 2024. Sucks to be you.\n\nThe Shining (1980)\n\nGene shared the law-firm story to illustrate how widespread this problem is. He suggests that the same chaos, which is undoubtedly unfolding across legal firms everywhere, could affect all writing and editorial jobs. You can imagine a world where demand for junior writers and editors starts to evaporate.\n\nMarket forces are nudging everyone towards having senior writers who are also good prompt engineers: An arrangement that meets all of their needs faster and cheaper than hiring junior humans.\n\nGene, as an accomplished and senior author, is delighted with his productivity gains with his LLM of choice, Claude Opus. He showed me a big writing project that he'd just finished, in which he had spent easily 45+ minutes crafting the prompt, refining it until he had a 7500-word narrative that could serve as a starting point for rewriting, editing, and adjustment. (In comparison, this blog post is about half that size.) And that draft was fantastic. I've read it and it's glorious.\n\nOn a good day, Gene can write 1,000 words per day. His estimate is that Claude did for him in 90 minutes what would normally have taken him ten days. It solves the \"blank-page problem\" and gets him to the 20-yard line, where the fun begins.\n\nHe estimates using an LLM as a writing tool gets him there 2-3x faster now, helping him meet his personal requirements and quality bar.\n\nGene could not be happier, at least for himself, because in addition to being faster, he also feels working this way is more fun. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, right? He's a happy dude.\n\nBut he is terrified for his teenage kids.\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)\n\nAnecdote: I watched the pod scene from the original black and white 50s version of this movie when I was about 8, and wow, that was traumatizingly scary. My wife has also been watching horror movies since she was about 4 (!) and we share a deep love of horror, probably because we're all messed up from childhood.\n\nWe've just seen the same plot play out for the legal profession and writing/editing jobs, where LLMs are threatening to out-people the people. Let's watch the same movie again in some genres closer to home.\n\nJust a few days ago our illustrious Head of AI, Rishabh Mehrotra, was showing me a classifier and multi-class prediction model that he had trained and deployed in a single day with ChatGPT. He said it would have been a 6-week University senior-level intern project a year ago. This is affecting data science too.\n\nAn old friend, great programmer and mathematician, who left AI for quantum computing for a few years, is back to programming. He confided – somewhat excitedly – that even though he does a lot of programming, he doesn't consider himself a programmer anymore.\n\nHe said he's more of a reviewer, or coach, or nanny, something like that. He makes ChatGPT do all the work and he just crafts prompts and reviews the output.\n\nThat resonated with me, since I, too, have been replaced by a bubble-bath plant pod human who pretends to be a programmer, but is in fact outsourcing almost all of it.\n\nNaturally, when I say \"make ChatGPT do all the work\", there is plenty of coding we still do by hand. What I mean is that chat-first is the default, and writing by hand (with completions, naturally!) is our fallback plan. My quantum friend and I are both finding much less need for that fallback recently.\n\nSince then I've found several other super amazing colleagues who have also adopted this coding strategy to accelerate themselves. And frankly it has been a bit of a relief to hear confirmation coming from so many great people that chat-first programming is indeed a New Thing.\n\nThe Thing (1982)\n\nIs it really new? Clearly this \"New Thing\" has already been around in other domains, since even the original ChatGPT was able to replace a lot of human labor.\n\nBut for coding, let's be serious here, chat coding has sucked. It would often be more effort to coax the LLM into a working solution than to write it yourself.\n\nWith the previous model generations, if you feed in an 800-line source code file and ask for substantial changes, even GPT4-Turbo (which many of you are using right now) will often run amok: Well-argued hallucinations, code that fails to parse, snarky \"code left as an exercise\" empty functions, designs leading you in circles going nowhere, unexpected refactorings, missing code, and all manner of other frustration.\n\nYou've probably tried it yourself. You know what I mean.\n\nSo chat programming has been sort of a bust. Nowadays most people equate AI coding assistants with code autocompletions. They think of chat as something you use when you're just starting out, maybe as a faster docs search.\n\nIn fact, there is a widespread perception that chat is for junior developers, and becomes less useful as you gain experience.\n\nAnd truth be told, this wasn't entirely inaccurate prior to mid-May. The models weren't quite there yet.\n\nBut for the past six weeks, things have been very, very different, and YOU my friend are missing out. That perception that chat is for juniors is now a flat-out misconception, one that I pray is stone dead in your heart by the end of this post.\n\nChopping Mall (1986)\n\nChat-based programming, which I will preemptively label Chat Oriented Programming (CHOP) or just \"chop\", because I suspect I'll be to be saying it a lot, is a brand-spanking new phenomenon. Like, seriously, just over a month old. I first noticed it when GPT-4o came out, which was mid-May.\n\nYou remember that big manufactured drama, right, about the new OpenAI \"4o\" GPT model supposedly having Scarlett Johansson's voice? That's the one.\n\nThat model changed everything about programming overnight.\n\nWhen GPT-4o dropped, it could suddenly edit 1000-line source files–a figure that encompasses 95+% of the source files in most repos worldwide–with tremendous precision and faithfulness to the original, leaving the untouched parts of the file 99.9% diff-perfect. Every once in a very rare while I see it drop a space character, or slightly mis-indent a line. But that's it.\n\nFrom what I've seen, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus have also cleared this hurdle. Which makes multi-model prompting a good bulwark against hallucinations, and a great way to select the best candidate for a design. Just feed your query to all of them and make ‘em fight it out. It's a common CHOP technique.\n\nBriefly, CHOP is coding via iterative prompt refinement. Everyone's attempts to get it to do anything complex used to peter out after 4 to 5 iterations, and the models couldn't make progress. But now your iterations usually converge, which means you're reviewing and ultimately approving more and more LLM code, and writing less and less yourself.\n\nSo programming has leveled up into a problem of explaining your situation to the LLM – that is, slinging context, since you'll want to include a lot of information from different sources – and then merging the output back into your code base.\n\nWe'd better get a tool for this. Chop chop!\n\nUpgrade (2018)\n\nThe big model upgrade was life-changing for people who have already been coding in raw ChatGPT, which is still the world's most-used and most popular AI coding assistant. ChatGPT coders have been using chop style for a year or more, but it has been only for the bravest, most patient, and dumbest of early adopters. Whereas now it's ready for everyone!\n\nOf course, raw chat involves a lot of manual assembly of context in and shoveling responses out, and it can get tedious, so many programmers use coding assistants instead. (I mean, I guess business is good if you are the CTRL, C, or V keys on a keyboard. Or ⌘ if you are into that sort of thing.)\n\nAll AI coding assistants benefit from this upgrade, too. It has certainly been huge for our coding assistant Cody, which in my opinion has the best chat due to our automated context assembly engine, which saves you from having to explain your code base every time. Plus Cody Pro lets you use both GPT-4o and Claude (and others), so you can spot-check all your work with another LLM.\n\nThe model upgrade is arguably even more effective with our inline edits feature, which handles dropping the response directly into your code. No more shoveling code out of the chat window. Cody just changes your code in place, undoably and retryably. The models are getting smarter, but the integration with your workflow is getting tighter as well.\n\nWhat's happening is a big deal. Programming this way is arguably on its way to being an order of magnitude speedup from completions-based programming. A 10x improvement might sound like an exaggeration. But we just saw examples from legal practice, publishing, and data science in the same ballpark, with 5-30x speedups for certain kinds of tasks, and estimates of at least 2-3x overall boost to productivity.\n\nYou can quibble over the numbers, but it's clear that programmers using CHOP with these new models are getting a turbo boost.\n\nWhy aren't you upgraded yet?\n\nThe Mangler (1995)\n\nTrivia: My brother told me that movie was so scary that he had to leave the theater. Never saw it myself, but the short story was fun.\n\nWe're going to do story #5 now, the very last story, and it's mine, and it's about programming, and the plot is different from the others.\n\nThis is where we learn the hard way why chat programming is for senior devs. Please keep your hands and limbs inside the carriage during the ride.\n\nThe other day GPT-4o shocked me with one of its coding proposals, while I was chopping away with it at a project. It was such a shock that I laughed for minutes, practically unhinged. I am not often shocked, least of all by looking at the code for a working program.\n\nI had presented a small design problem to GPT, asking for an evaluation of my options. It's great for that. Chat-oriented programming (CHOP) isn't just about coding. There are a lot of design discussions too. You do everything, even writing sometimes, with the LLM as a pair partner.\n\nFor some reason, this time ChatGPT launched full-bore into redesigning an entire subsystem of the framework I was stuck in, which had an issue I was trying to work around. I'm sure you have seen this wack behavior from LLMs before. The difference is, now they are very good at rewriting things, and sometimes they'll swing for the fences, consequences schmonsequences.\n\nGPT-4o breezed quickly past most of the sane options before plowing straight into \"let's rewrite it all\" scorched-earth mode, clearly not having read Joel Spolsky. It spewed out an unusually long answer, hundreds of lines of code and instructions, presenting thorough and persuasive reasoning supporting this approach.\n\nAnd the rewrite would have worked! It was a very direct solution to my problem. So it wasn't \"wrong\" per se. There are rarely things in design that are truly wrong – like, wrong wrong – as there are exceptions to most rules.\n\nThere was only one teeny tiny issue with it, which is that it would have killed someone.\n\nNot on my project, hopefully! But if the model is currently spitting out similar suggestions to people working on software that controls giant saws in machine shops, someone's gonna die.\n\nCabin in the Woods (2011)\n\nGPT's redesign was awful – but not when you looked directly at it. Up close it was downright cozy.\n\nYou had to pull back and look at the design in the broader context of its interactions with other subsystems, but also support, maintenance, upgrades, add-ons, and a bunch of other dimensions that are critically important to software design and engineering. With that wider lens, it was an Unbreakable-level train wreck waiting to happen.\n\nBut it was wearing a superb disguise. A less experienced dev would surely have fallen for it. I could feel the power and the attraction of the approach it was espousing, the force of the arguments backing it. The whole thing was appealingly packaged, technically correct, and laid out for you to just take it and run! (My pal Chris Smith says the word I'm looking for is \"specious\". So yeah, that.)\n\nAnd it just hit me all at once how hilariously inappropriate and potentially dangerous this answer was. It was so impressive and so spooky. I laughed and laughed, like a little kid watching bubble bath plant monsters replacing all the people.\n\nMy senior colleagues have recently recounted similar chat scenarios in which a more junior dev would have been completely taken in, potentially losing days to weeks of work going the wrong direction.\n\nOr worse.\n\nChat, it seems, is safer for senior programmers than it is for junior ones. And a lot of companies are going to interpret \"safer\" to mean \"better.\"\n\nBuckle up. Topsy-turvy times ahead.\n\nThe Stand (2020)\n\nA lot of companies ask me, how can we tell which parts were written by the AI and which parts by the programmer? Well, if chat-oriented programming becomes the dominant modality for programmers, then LLMs will be writing the vast majority of all source code worldwide. That's a gargantuan shift, and it might even shake up the traditional software engineering roles.\n\nWe've seen how this shift affected a law firm, a publisher, and engineering's sibling discipline of data science. Stock in junior contributors is down, and there is concern there could be a market crash.\n\nThat presents a very serious problem for new people in those fields. What do you do? How do you learn the ropes, not to mention find gainful employment? What are the ropes now? And what do the companies do when their senior people retire?\n\nThey could wind up like the COBOL world which is in a worldwide crunch, because there are no junior COBOL devs to replace the ones who retired. Ironically, these huge legacy companies will likely be rooting hardest for the LLMs to write all their code.\n\nThings are changing fast. I'm an optimist, and I generally think, or at least hope, that as companies become more productive in the coming months and years, they simply get correspondingly more ambitious.\n\nEveryone will need to get a lot more serious about testing and reviewing code. Senior devs could become full-time reviewers and junior devs shepherd the LLMs, maybe?\n\nIt doesn't necessarily have to end with a post-apocalyptic wasteland for recent CS grads.\n\n28 Days Later (2002)\n\nI wrote this post a week ago and have been thinking hard about whether I believe the premise, which is that within a few years, the norm for source code will be that it is written and modified by LLMs via prompting. For all practical purposes, all source code will be written this way, with exceptions becoming ever rarer.\n\nNot only do I believe it, I could even see it happening in 12-18 months at the current rate of LLM progress. I think the change will have a ton of fallout, only some of it foreseeable. And one casualty might well be junior devs, in the sense that they become less marketable and it could cause various kinds of crunches across the industry.\n\nWe've already seen the big companies doing eng layoffs to make room for AI practitioners. Small companies may be faced with their own version of this decision: Why hire a junior developer to write mediocre code, when the LLM will do that for you ten times faster?\n\nSo yeah. I'm worried.\n\nBriefly, what do I mean by \"senior\" here? Really just two things:\n\nYou know what you want before the AI writes it. You already have a vision for how you would write this by hand, or have it narrowed to a few reasonable options.\n\nYou can detect when it is giving you bad guidance.\n\nIf you know exactly where you are driving, and you know what bad roads look like, then turbochargers can be safe and will get you there faster. If you're not sure where you're driving, activating the turbochargers will get you somewhere fast.\n\nLeave the World Behind (2023)\n\nSo. You've made it this far. Congrats!. What's going to happen? I don't know. Maybe we'll get really lucky. I mean, I'd be very happy to be wrong here.\n\nBut change is coming. There will be social and cultural upheaval in tech, just as is happening in the legal profession. It's already begun. The models are getting smarter and smarter with each passing month, which means they are going to be eating more and more jobs until they eat the world.\n\nAll I can tell you is this: Get there early. One time Googlers were complaining at TGIF that the parking garage was filling up by midmorning, and Larry Page jokingly suggested, \"Maybe you should come earlier.\" At that moment he reeked of billionaire. But if you really wanted to park in the garage, you took his advice.\n\nIf you want to survive the change, you'd better show up prepared and stay on top of it.\n\nThe rest of this post is just some direct, simple, and timeless advice for junior and aspiring software engineers. I hope it can help get you through this awkward period where our industry collectively figures out what exactly the hell is going to happen.\n\nFinal Destination (2000)\n\nGet good, fast. That's what you need to do. Get ahead of the slackers while our industry turns upside down, and you might be the one to survive.\n\nYou are competing with students from Waterloo, who have 2+ years of actual work experience by the time they graduate with a bachelor's in CS. You're also competing with the top 10% of all CS grads nationwide, who are, year after year, already effectively senior engineers, despite this being their first real job.\n\nHere are some shotgun recommendations. Do with them as you see fit.\n\nGain experience anywhere and any way you can, before you even leave school. Get work experience, contribute to OSS, program on the side. Take your classes seriously. Learn more than is required for passing each class. Learn each subject thoroughly, and revisit them all as you go.\n\nDon't over-index on programming language arcana. That's becoming a detail that machines handle for us. Focus on algorithms, data structures, software design and engineering, discrete math, operating systems, compilers, databases, networks. Focus on studying real systems. Find walkthroughs online and study them. And of course ML. Gobble up everything you can.\n\nUnderstand how things are built. Make sure you know how every system in a computer works. Make sure you have an understanding of how every cloud service you depend on does its job. Read the docs, and then read the design docs. You won't have to write any of it by hand. But you need to develop a senior programmer's sensibilities around how these things fit together and interact, for good or ill.\n\nLearn how to use frontier models to check other LLM models' work. Sign up for multiple services (e.g. Claude and ChatGPT) and send your important prompts to at least two big models. Have them evaluate each other's responses and study it all carefully. LLMs are better at reviewing and critiquing their own content than they are at producing it. So use a second LLM as your senior partner.\n\nAnother one of the key things that differentiates a senior developer from a junior one, in many contexts, is Operations experience. Read the O'Reilly/Google SRE book. Read it cover to cover. And find a good GitOps book, too; there seem to be quite a few to choose from. There may be no compression algorithm for experience, but fortunately a lot of that experience has been condensed and distilled. Go drink it up.\n\nLean hard on a coding assistant like Cody. Stay on the bleeding edge of features. A coding assistant is a powerful tool, like an IDE, and learning to master it will level you up as a programmer. CHOP involves a lot of manual context shoveling to craft your prompt. Cody does 90% of that shoveling for you, as well as copying the responses back into your code.\n\nMost devs using chat still use raw ChatGPT for coding, even though it doesn't help you with context fetching or data shoveling. And it's great all by itself, though more manual work in prompt crafting. I have been using GPT directly in Emacs, with the excellent chatgpt-shell, because I'm still building Cody for Emacs so I can't use it yet. Raw GPT-4o is still great.\n\nI used to tell people to master an IDE, and even better, also Emacs or Neovim. But I'm not sure anymore. That might become obsolete soon. Wait until the coding assistants can do it for you; it won't be long. Or even come help.\n\nIt doesn't matter what approach you take, as long as you start making heavy use of chat in programming. Because that, friendo, is how it works now. Like it or not. And you need to survive it. Good luck to you.\n\nI will start a channel soon dedicated to showing the new way of programming, as I help build Cody using chop-style coding. I will use both ChatGPT directly and Cody, and they will help me build Cody. Stay tuned!\n\nI'll also be giving a talk that touches on this and much more in August at the Enterprise Technology Leadership Summit in Las Vegas. Hope to see you there.\n\nP.S. Thanks to Chris Smith, Gene Kim, Dominic Cooney, and Anna Noak for their thorough reviews and great suggestions.",
      "# [Sourcegraph went dark](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41296481)\nThanks for being a fan. And I understand it's a bummer to not have our code be public and open-source anymore. Sorry.\n\nIt's a bunch of reasons that add up. I'll give some more details for anyone curious.\n\n(And I know that despite these reasons, lots of HNers probably wish it was not so. I agree! I too wish for a world where all companies could have their code be public and open source.)\n\n- We have a lot of tech around large-scale code graph, indexing, etc., stuff that is very differentiated and hard to build. We were starting to put some of this in separate private repositories and link them in at build time, but that was complex. It added a lot of code complexity, risked bugs, and slowed us down, and if a lot of the awesome stuff was private anyway, what was the point?\n\n- As we've been building Cody (https://cody.dev), our code AI tool, we've seen a LOT more abuse. That's what happens when you offer any free tier of a product with LLM inference. We had to move a lot more of our internal backend abuse logic to private repositories, and it added code complexity to incorporate that private stuff in at build time.\n\n- It confused devs and customers to have 2 releases: an open-source release with less scaley/enterprisey features, and an enterprise release. It was a pain to migrate from one to the other (GitLab also felt this pain with their product) because the open-source build had a subset of the DB schema and other things. It was confusing to have a free tier on the enterprise release (lots of people got that mixed up with the open-source release), and it made our pricing and packaging complex so that lots of our time was spent helping customers understand what is paid and what isn't.\n\n- There were actually very very few companies that were going to pay but then decided to use the open-source version and not pay us. A lot of people probably assume that's why we made this move, but it's not. I think this is because people like the product and see value in it, including all the large-scale code nav/search features that are in our enterprise version.\n\n- Although very very few companies used our open-source version to avoid paying us, we did see it cause a lot of annoyance for devs who were asked by their management to try cloning our product or to research our codebase to give their procurement team ammunition to negotiate down our price. This honestly was just a waste of everyone's time.\n\n- If we got a ton of contributions (we never really solicited any), then it might've changed the calculus. Sourcegraph is an end-user application that you use at work (and when fun-coding, but the primary revenue model is for us to charge companies). For various reason, end-user server-side applications just don't get nearly as many contributions. Maybe it's because you'd need to redeploy your build for a bunch of other users at your company, not just yourself. Maybe it's because they necessarily entail UX, frontend, and scaling stuff, in addition to just adding new features.\n\n- We heard from people who left GitHub that people at GitHub were frequently monitoring our repository to get wind of our upcoming features and launches. Someone from GitHub told me his \"job is to clone Sourcegraph\". Since then, they obviously deprioritized their code search to re-found GitHub on AI, so we're not seeing this threat anymore. But I didn't love giving Microsoft an unfair advantage, especially since GitHub products are not open source either.\n\n- Since we made our code non-open-source, we've been able to pursue a lot more big partnerships (e.g., with cloud providers and other distribution partners and resellers). This is a valuable revenue stream that helps us make a better product overall. Again, because Sourcegraph is an end-user application with a UI that devs constantly use and care about, we never really had the MongoDB/Redis/CockroachDB risk of AWS/GCP/Azure just deploying our stuff and cutting us out. We're not protecting from downside here, but we are enjoying the upside because now those kinds of distribution partnerships are viable for us. To give a specific example, within ~2 months of making our code non-open-source last year, we signed a $1M+ ARR deal through a distribution partner that would not have happened if our code was open source. This is not our biggest annual deal, but it's still really nice!\n\nWe are totally focused on building the best code search/intelligence and appreciate all our customers and all the feedback here. Hope this helps explain a bit more where we're coming from!\n\nI don't see any attempt to veil it -- there was specific mention of revenue and competitors\n\nDid SourceGraph make any promises about a community or free support? (honest question)\n\nI think your expectations may be off, perhaps learned from corporate marketing. \"Open source\" by itself does not mean necessarily\n\n1. you get any support\n\n2. there is a community [1]\n\n3. you're entitled to all future source code by that person or company, whether under the same project name or not.\n\n---\n\nIt could be that SourceGraph has broken some promises, and that IS pretty typical of VC-backed companies.\n\nBut so far I don't see evidence of that.\n\nQuoting my comment: https://lobste.rs/s/tg5vwi/sourcegraph_went_dark#c_vnaqxu\n\nEven according to Stallman, free software never required any kind of support, open development, or commit history. You can publish a tarball on a web server, and that counts as free software.\n\ni.e. publishing source code doesn’t sign you up for a lifelong obligation. People can fork it, or not fork it.\n\n---\n\nPractically speaking, I might think of SourceGraph as something like Android.\n\nIs Android open source? Yes. [2]\n\nDoes it have huge proprietary parts? Yes.\n\nIt is designed for collaborative development? Not really unless you work for a big company, and are paid to work on Android. (That said, I'm sure there are hobbyists / \"people in their basement\" that do meaningful things with Android source code -- and actually I think that is how some open phone companies started)\n\nIs it better than it's open rather than closed? Yes. Multiple competitors to Google use Android source code, e.g. Amazon has built phones off of it. That is good thing IMO.\n\n---\n\n[1] On my own open source projects, there is a community and best-effort support, and I really encourage that! But the point is that there are MULTIPLE valid project models under the name \"open source\".\n\nThrowing code over the wall is actually valid open source, and it actually benefits society IMO. It's still valuable, even if you STOP doing it, as SourceGraph has done.\n\nIt's distinct from \"I get free stuff that I like using\"\n\nThere could be a different name for \"unfunded or independently funded open source\", but the funny thing is that the term \"open source\" originated as a corporate-friendly alternative to \"free software\"\n\n[2] As a tangent, I also think Android has a really suboptimal and cloud-slanted architecture, but for this discussion, let's just use it as a an example of corporate open source",
      "# [Issues with Cody Not Finding Relevant Files Compared to Cursor on 2024-08-19](https://community.sourcegraph.com/t/issues-with-cody-not-finding-relevant-files-compared-to-cursor/908)\nI just want to let the developers know that I’m getting “empty” results in terms of file numbers when asking questions that Cursor can easily handle. For example, when I ask something like, “Where is the movement system for characters in this game?” Cursor successfully identifies the main Movement script along with several other related scripts. However, Cody fails to find any relevant files and instead provides explanations based on the project name, without identifying the actual files. This isn’t an isolated issue—it’s the same for any other questions I ask. Because of this, I’ve completely stopped using Cody for navigating my codebase.\n\nJust to clarify, in case it matters: my projects are Unity projects with 10-200 scripts, many folders, and a functioning Codyignore file (which excludes plenty of folders and files). I know the ignore file is working because Cody doesn’t interact with the ignored files.\n\nI’m open to the possibility that my issues are caused by an unstable Codyignore, but when I see articles like this one (Chat-oriented programming (CHOP) in action), “Let’s ask something a little more complex - such as how would I add a new LLM model to our Cody VS Code extension.” - I’m amazed that I can’t achieve anything even remotely similar. I’m curious if the developers are aware of these issues and if they are being worked on, or if I’m the only one experiencing this?\n\nHi there!\n\nWhile trying to take a screenshot, I managed to narrow down the issue a bit.\n\nA lot of it has to do with the language used for the query. When using Cursor, I’m used to making queries in a language other than English, and this usually doesn’t cause any issues. With Cody, things at least start working when I make queries in English (in both blended and embeddings modes). This partially resolves the problem for me… But an automatic translation of the query into English (which seems to be critical) would be much more convenient for many users whose native language is not English.\n\nWhat practically doesn’t work at all (or works strangely) in any language is the “Keyword” context mode. I noticed something else during testing: in this mode, it’s critical not to place punctuation marks immediately after the last letter. I’m attaching two screenshots in this mode. In one of them, the question mark is attached to the last word (and the chat can’t find any files), while in the other, it’s not (apparently, this is the correct way to search, but how would a user know this?)—and the chat finds a file, but it’s the wrong one! And that’s odd—it’s clear from the screenshot that I have a file with that name, which contains a class with that name. But Cody suggests a different file for some reason.\n\nRegarding the embeddings mode, as I found out earlier, it generally works in English. And I could probably rely on it. But there are two important nuances, especially the second one, which makes it difficult to do so, unlike with Cursor:\n\n3.1. First, Cody indexes everything, the entire project. In my case (a Unity game), it indexes 1000 times more than necessary, ignoring the ignore file. I’m not sure if this is good for subsequent efficiency, but I hope that during the queries, the ignore file will at least help avoid distractions. In any case, indexing a new project can take 20-30 minutes. I tried switching to the pre-release version (v1.31.1724080603), and maybe I misunderstood something, but it seems like no indexing happens at all in that version.\n\n3.2. More importantly, the indexing frequency. In Cursor, it happens every 10 minutes and can be initiated manually. Considering that the ignore file is taken into account there, it only takes a few seconds. When the indexing of updates happens in Cody, I don’t understand at all. Sometimes something significant changes in the project within minutes, and waiting for it for weeks (or however long it takes) seems strange. I know that you can delete the corresponding files for re-indexing, but then you’ll have to wait another 30 minutes.\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time on these experiments and descriptions for you, and I hope that this helps improve something.\n\n.\n\n!/.cody\n\n!.ignore\n\n!/Assets/\n\n/Assets/*\n\n!/Assets/Scripts/\n\n!.txt\n\n!.cs",
      "# [Efficient scaleups in 2024 vs 2021: Sourcegraph (with CEO & Co by Gergely Orosz on 2024-10-09](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/quinn-slack-efficient-scalups)\nThe Pragmatic Engineer Podcast had a very warm reception with the first episode — thank you! Two weeks later, here is episode #2, with a CEO who still codes every day: Quinn Slack at Sourcegraph.\n\nListen now on Apple, Spotify, and YouTube.\n\nBrought to you by:\n\n• Paragon: ​​Build native, customer-facing SaaS integrations 7x faster.\n\n• Enterprise Ready Conferfence on 30 October: a one-day event in SF for product and engineering leaders shaping the future of enterprise SaaS.\n\nOn today’s episode of The Pragmatic Engineer, I’m joined by Quinn Slack, CEO and co-founder of Sourcegraph, a leading code search and intelligence platform. Quinn holds a degree in Computer Science from Stanford and is deeply passionate about coding: to the point that he still codes every day! He also serves on the board of Hack Club, a national nonprofit dedicated to bringing coding clubs to high schools nationwide. In this insightful conversation, we discuss:\n\nHow Sourcegraph's operations have evolved since 2021\n\nWhy more software engineers should focus on delivering business value\n\nWhy Quinn continues to code every day, even as a CEO\n\nPractical AI and LLM use cases and a phased approach to their adoption\n\nThe story behind Job Fairs at Sourcegraph and why it’s no longer in use\n\nQuinn’s leadership style and his focus on customers and product excellence\n\nThe shift from location-independent pay to zone-based pay at Sourcegraph\n\nAnd much more!\n\nTakeaways\n\nSome of my main takeaways from this conversation are these.\n\n1. As software engineers, it’s increasingly important to understand what value you add to the business. A big difference between 2021 and 2024 is how companies are much more focused on efficiency: meaning they are hiring more conservatively, and less likely to fund teams with headcount that don’t contribute to the core focus of the company.\n\nAs a developer or manager, try to figure out how much your team contributes in revenue, or savings, or other key goals to the company. Are you working in what the company would consider as a profit center, or what is more as a cost center? We did a deepdive on this topic in The Pragmatic Engineer: check out the article, linked in the show notes.\n\n2. AI tools are great to eliminate the toil that we, developers face, day-to-day. There are AI tools that position themselves as their goal being “replacing developers.” I found it sympathetic that Quinn did not think this is the sensible path. His approach is to start by using AI tools with some of the “dumbest things” like generating the changelog for a software release – I mean, assuming you generate a changelog. And then you take tedious tasks where these tools could help, and see if you can automate some more.\n\nDo this one step at a time: and it will actually help devs and teams, and it’s a lot more achievable than saying “let’s replace this whole complicated workflow with AI.”\n\n3. The reality of location independent pay is that it stops being sensible above a certain company size. Sourcegraph was one of the few companies that offered the same base salary regardless of where people worked at. They did this until they grew to about 200 people, and switched this model to a location-indexed model.\n\nQuinn was honest about why they did it: because keeping this would have not made sense for the company, from the business point of view. Basically, location-independent pay means the company can hire very easily in low-cost regions, but it’s hard or impossible to do this in high-cost regions. It also creates the incentive for employees to move to a low cost region where they can save more. In the end, I don’t know of any company with more than 200 people that pays location-independent: all large companies have some kind of indexing on location, and the best companies just pay the top of the local market. We cover more about compensation in the deepdive on The trimodal nature of software engineering salaries.\n\nIf you enjoy the podcast, I’d very much appreciate if you subscribe on your favorite podcast player, and leave a review.

      "# [Sourcegraph went dark on 2024-08-19](https://eric-fritz.com/articles/sourcegraph-went-dark/)\nTowards the end of my mid-2019 job search, I was down to joining the Google Go team or Sourcegraph. Sourcegraph ultimately won due to cultural factors - the most important of which was the ability to build 100% in the open. All documents were public by default. Technical and product RFCs (and later PR/FAQs) were drafted, reviewed, and catalogued in a public Google Drive folder. All product implementation was done in public GitHub repositories.\n\nToday, the sourcegraph/sourcegraph repository went private. This is the final cleaving blow, following many other smaller chops, on the culture that made Sourcegraph an attractive place to work. It’s a decision for a business from which I resigned, and therefore have no voice. But I still lament the rocky accessibility of artifacts showing four years of genuine effort into a product that I loved (and miss the use of daily in my current role).\n\nOn the bright side, I’ve cemented my place on the insights leaderboard for the remainder of time.\n\nKeeping references alive\n\nOver my tenure at Sourcegraph I’ve done a fair bit of writing for the engineering blog, which I’ve inlined into this website for stable reference. It’s interesting to see what people are trying to build and, for an engineer, how they’re trying to build it. Much of my writing used links into relevant public code as a reference.\n\nAll of these links are now broken.\n\nThere’s a common saying that cool URIs don’t change. In a related sense, I have the hot take that cool articles don’t suddenly start rotting links. I’m going to break at least one of these best practices, and I can’t do anything about the first one. So I’ll attempt to preserve as much information in this writing as possible by moving these links into a repository under my influence.\n\nI'm opting to bite the bullet now and move references to something completely under my control rather than kick then can down the road by referencing another repository that _could_ suddenly disappear at any time.\n\nI had a feeling this would be a risk a while ago, so I had forked sourcegraph/sourcegraph into efritz/sourcegraph in preparation. Given the fork, it should be easy enough job to do a global find-and-replace of one repository name with another at this point and mission accomplished, right?\n\nUnfortunately, no. I had links to code on the main branch, but also links to pull requests and commits within pull requests. Forks don’t inherit pull requests (problem #1). And commits not directly referenced by a branch of your fork are visible as only as long as they’re part of the repository network (problem #2).\n\nI had wondered what happens to forks when a repository is deleted or changes visibility and found some calming information in the official GitHub documentation:\n\nIn other words, a public repository’s forks will remain public in their own separate repository network even after the upstream repository is made private. This allows the fork owners to continue to work and collaborate without interruption. […] If a public repository is made private and then deleted, its public forks will continue to exist in a separate network.\n\nMy fork will continue to exist (yay), but the source repository becoming inaccessible might take commits outside of the main branch with it. I need to ensure that these commits are part of the new repository network.\n\nScraping for relevant commits\n\nStep one is to find all the commits I care about. I ran the following Go program to iterate through all of my pull requests on the source repository and write their payloads to disk for further processing.\n\nThis program yielded 2,645 files with pull request metadata. I then used jq to read these JSON payloads and extract data for subsequent steps.\n\nThis script creates three files:\n\npr_ids.txt is a flat list of GitHub identifiers, which are used in URLs. Since the list endpoint returns only enough data to render a pull request list, we’ll need to fetch additional information (intermediate commits) for each pull request by its ID.\n\ncommits.txt is a flat list of git SHAs that were a result of merging a PR into the target branch (not always main). These commits may or may not be in the forked repository network, depending on the merge target. These should be synced over.\n\nreplace_pairs.txt contains pairs of of pull request identifier and its merge commit. This will later be used to mass replace /pull/{id} with /commit/{sha}. Since pull requests can’t be linked directly anymore, I can at least link to the full pull request contents.\n\nNext, I ran a second program (with the same preamble as the program above) to list all the non-merge commits of each pull request. Based on the pants-on-head way I work, these will mostly be WIP. commits, but sometimes I did a better job and (possibly) linked directly to these.\n\nRunning go run . >> commits.txt dumped these commits onto the end of the file and completes the set of Git SHAs that need to be brought into the repository network for stable reference.\n\nBringing commits into the new repository network\n\nGiven the warning above (“does not belong to any branch on this repository”), it should be sufficient to ensure that my fork has a branch containing each relevant SHA I’d like to retain access to.\n\nBash here does a good enough job since all we’re doing is a bunch of git operations in sequence.\n\nRewriting references\n\nAt this point I should be safe and have some target to link to in my fork for each reference to a pull request or commit in the source repository. Now I just have to figure out how to automate that process (there are at least 275 code references over 15 files and I’m not doing that by hand).\n\nIronically, I used my own thing instead of Cody to figure out how to use xargs correctly for this task.",

      "# [Sourcegraph enhances the intelligence and speed of their AI-powered coding assistant with Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/customers/sourcegraph)\nSourcegraph’s AI coding assistant, Cody, uses Claude 3 Sonnet as the default large language model for the free plan, delivering suggestions twice as fast with increased accuracy for developers.\n\nCreating a faster, intelligent AI coding assistant\n\nSourcegraph is a code intelligence company that builds tools for developers to search and navigate code across an entire codebase. In 2023, it introduced Cody: an artificial intelligence (AI) coding assistant designed to help developers write and understand code faster. By analyzing the entire codebase, Cody provides context-aware chat and other valuable tools that take into account the full project scope rather than relying on isolated code snippets, significantly accelerating software development.\n\n“Cody accelerates the inner loop of software development,” says Beyang Liu, Chief Technology Officer and Cofounder of Sourcegraph. “It has features like inline completions, codebase-aware chat, inline editing, and tools that alleviate some of the day-to-day burdens that developers experience. This accelerates the pace at which they’re able to write code.”\n\nFrom its initial release, Cody has allowed developers to select Claude as the large language model powering its features. In 2024, Sourcegraph made the entire Claude 3 model family—Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus—accessible to developers on every Cody plan.\n\n“Claude 3 models excel at following instructions, generating production-ready code without requiring manual intervention or code snippets,” says Philipp Spiess, Software Engineer at Sourcegraph. “We’re confident that it effectively meets developers’ needs and propels their projects forward.”\n\nImproving developer workflows with the Claude 3 model family\n\nOptimized for different levels of speed and intelligence, each Claude 3 model excels at different functions within Cody while helping Sourcegraph keep its costs low without compromising quality.\n\nClaude 3 Sonnet serves as the default model for the free version of Cody, with improved coding abilities and two times the speed of Anthropic’s previous model, Claude 2.1. Pro and Enterprise users can take advantage of Opus, Anthropic’s most powerful model with industry-leading coding abilities and long-context recall accuracy. Devs also have the option of using Haiku—Anthropic’s fastest model—for use cases where rapid responses are critical.\n\nThe Claude 3 model family is integral to Cody’s chat and custom command features. Developers can ask questions and receive answers related to their entire codebase, which helps quickly resolve issues and understand complex code interactions. They can also request Cody to perform specific tasks, such as refactoring code or generating documentation, with the custom commands feature. With the near-perfect recall accuracy of Claude 3 Opus, Cody gives developers even better results because it can understand large amounts of code context without missing key information.\n\n“We’ve decided to use Claude as our default chat model in Cody,” says Liu. “It’s fantastic at incorporating the context we provide into accurate answers about a user’s private codebase and writing code that fits within the context of your code. The family of models, from Opus to Haiku, provides several great points along the frontier of speed and intelligence that power multiple Cody features.”\n\nAchieving more accurate results for developers\n\nSourcegraph’s AI assistant, now enhanced by Claude, has transformed the coding experience for developers. Since rolling out Claude 3 Sonnet as the default model to Cody Free users, Sourcegraph has seen an approximate 75 percent increase in code insert rate; Cody users are taking almost twice as much code from Cody’s suggestions and inserting it directly into their files, which indicates an increase in code quality.\n\nClaude 3 Sonnet delivers chat and command responses at twice the speed of its predecessor, which further accelerates the coding process. Sourcegraph also saw that roughly 55 percent of Cody Pro users switched their default model to the new Claude 3 models in the month following the launch.\n\nSourcegraph plans to expand Cody’s capabilities even further. The company has launched an experimental project to bring more context sources into its integrated development environment, such as system monitoring metrics, to enhance the accuracy and relevancy of the code suggestions. This improvement will take advantage of the large 200K context window available in every Claude 3 model, which will set the stage for even more sophisticated AI interactions. “Our users will soon have the ability to reliably generate code changes, especially with the Claude 3 Haiku model,” says Spiess. “Before, no model offered the latency required to make code edits. We’re now prototyping features with this use case so that we can make the most out of these capabilities.”\n\nThese advancements will help solidify Cody as an essential tool in a developer’s repository, and Anthropic is working closely with Sourcegraph to make these upgrades possible. “We’re very happy with our partnership with Anthropic,” says Liu. “The team has been absolutely a delight to work with—super helpful and super sharp. We’re looking forward to continuing to build with Claude to push the frontier of AI coding capabilities.”",
