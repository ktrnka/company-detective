      "# [Sourcegraph Forum](https://community.sourcegraph.com/faq)\nThis is a Civilized Place for Public Discussion\n\nPlease treat this discussion forum with the same respect you would a public park. We, too, are a shared community resource — a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation.\n\nThese are not hard and fast rules. They are guidelines to aid the human judgment of our community and keep this a kind, friendly place for civilized public discourse.\n\nImprove the Discussion\n\nHelp us make this a great place for discussion by always adding something positive to the discussion, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.\n\nOne way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Spend time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.\n\nThe topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.\n\nBe Agreeable, Even When You Disagree\n\nYou may wish to respond by disagreeing. That’s fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid:\n\nName-calling\n\nAd hominem attacks\n\nResponding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content\n\nKnee-jerk contradiction\n\nInstead, provide thoughtful insights that improve the conversation.\n\nYour Participation Counts\n\nThe conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be — and avoiding those that do not.\n\nDiscourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, watching, muting and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.\n\nLet’s leave our community better than we found it.\n\nIf You See a Problem, Flag It\n\nModerators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.\n\nWhen you see bad behavior, don’t reply. Replying encourages bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. Just flag it. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.\n\nIn order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.\n\nAlways Be Civil\n\nNothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:\n\nBe civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.\n\nKeep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.\n\nRespect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.\n\nRespect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.\n\nThese are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of a major news site.\n\nThis is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.\n\nKeep It Tidy\n\nMake the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:\n\nDon’t start a topic in the wrong category; please read the category definitions.\n\nDon’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.\n\nDon’t post no-content replies.\n\nDon’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.\n\nDon’t sign your posts — every post has your profile information attached to it.\n\nRather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.\n\nPost Only Your Own Stuff\n\nYou may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.\n\nPowered by You\n\nThis site is operated by your friendly local staff and you, the community. If you have any further questions about how things should work here, open a new topic in Site Feedback and let’s discuss!

The value of event: is always a string that describes the type of the event. The value of data: is always JSON.\n\nNOTE: The search stream API follows the server-sent events format. However, we do not guarantee compatibility with any third-party clients written for server-sent events, and recommend using the src-cli tool or writing your own wrapper around the API.\n\nEvent-types\n\nEvents can be of the following types:\n\nExample (curl)\n\nOn Sourcegraph.com we can run queries without authentication.\n\nFAQ\n\nQ: How can I run an exhaustive search directly against the Stream API?\n\nTo search a pattern over all indexed repositories, add count:all and remove all repo filters. For example, to search all indexed repositories for the string \"secret\", you can run the following command\n\nIf you don't want to write your own client, you can also use Sourcegraph's src-cli.\n\nQ: Are there plans for supporting a streaming client or interface with more functionality (e.g., parallelizing multiple streaming requests or aggregating results from multiple streams)?\n\nThere are currently no plans to support additional client-side functionality to interact with a streaming endpoint. We recommend users write their own scripts or client wrappers that handle, e.g., firing multiple requests, accepting and aggregating the return values, and additional result formatting or processing.",
      "# [Sourcegraph docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/analytics)\nAnalytics\n\nThe analytics section helps Sourcegraph administrators understand user engagement across the various Sourcegraph features, identify power users, and convey value to internal leaders. Introduced in version 3.42, the section includes analytics breakdowns for our most common features such as Batch Changes, Search Notebooks and search, while also providing basic user-level analytics.\n\nData Visualizations\n\nThe goal of these pages is to help administrators answer any question they might have about how features are being used within their Sourcegraph instance. So far, we have introduced pages for Search, Batch Changes, Code Intel, Search, and Search Notebooks, as well as a general users page.\n\nEach page can visualize the past one week, the past one month, or the path three months of data. For graphs that show user data, the graph can toggle between total users or unique users.\n\nThese graphs pull directly from the event log table within the Sourcegraph instance they are running. There should not be an increase to the storage on disk of these tables due to these new features. Further, no data beyond published ping data is sent back to Sourcegraph.\n\nValue Calculators\n\nEach page also includes a total time saved value which can be used to measure the value Sourcegraph is bringing to your organization. This metric is derived from the configurable calculators below the total time saved value. Each calculator multiplies event log data (ex: number of precise code intel events such as a go-to-definition) by a configurable number of minutes saved per event to arrive at a time saved by the feature.\n\nWe designed this to be configurable by you because we want to...\n\nhelp admins understand the value that is being seen by their organization today.\n\nbe customizable so admins can explore what changes will best increase developer time saved.\n\nThese calculators exist on the Search, Code Intel, Batch Changes, and Notebooks analytics pages. Each calculator looks different as they include metrics specifically designed for that part of the application. Please note that the calculator configuration does not save and will return to the default if you navigate away from the page.\n\nIf you have questions about how this works or about how to convey this value to leaders within your organization, please do not hesitate to reach out to your customer engineer.\n\nFAQ\n\nWho has access to see these improved analytics? Where can I find it?\n\nTo see these new visualizations, you must be a site admin. You can find these under Site Admin section, under the Analytics section of the left-nav bar.\n\nDo these improved analytics require sending data to Sourcegraph?\n\nNo! The processing happens entirely within a your instance so no data is sent in or out of your instance. Further, these improved analytics leverage data already being captured within the event log table of your instance so there is no additional storage or processing required for this change. Basically, customers should notice no perceivable difference to their infrastructure.\n\nHow often is the data updated?\n\nThe data is updated approximately every 24 hours.\n\nHow does this work with the existing usage stats page?\n\nThis new analytics experience has been redesigned from the ground up to provide the most value to administrators. In the future, we plan to deprecate the legacy usage stats page and statistics section once this functionality moved from experimental to generally available.",
      "# [Sourcegraph docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/postgres)\nPostgreSQL\n\nSourcegraph uses several PostgreSQL databases to support various functionality. These databases are:\n\npgsql or primary: responsible for user data and account information\n\ncodeintel-db: provides support for lsif data and part of the code-intelligence\n\ncodeinsights-db: provides support for code insights data\n\nRequirements\n\nVersion requirements\n\nWe support Postgres 16 and above. Older versions of Sourcegraph supported 12 see our Postgres 12 deprecation notice for more details. Starting in Sourcegraph 6.0.0, sourcegraph services will no longer connect to a PostgreSQL 12 or lower database. Instead, it will display an error message in container logs for services attempting to connect to a PostgreSQL database below version 16.\n\nSourcegraph services attempting to connect to a database running Postgres 12 or less will display the following error message:\n\nSee below for more details about how to upgrade your PostgreSQL database.\n\nRole requirements\n\nThe user provided to Sourcegraph must have full access to the sg database and be able to create the following extensions:\n\nConfiguring PostgreSQL\n\nSourcegraph databases come preconfigured, however admins may make custom configurations as needed. For more information see our configuration docs.\n\nUpgrading PostgreSQL\n\nUpgrading Built-in PostgreSQL\n\nIn Sourcegraph 5.10.0, we've upgraded our builtin database images to PostgreSQL 16.\n\nDatabase Image Updates:\n\npostgres-12 is now postgresql-16\n\ncodeintel-db is now postgresql-16\n\ncodeinsights-db is now postgresql-16-codeinsights\n\nThese images contain an entry script that will detect and upgrade Postgres instances from version 12 (the version in our previous images) to Postgres 16.\n\nWARNING: Upgrading the PostgreSQL database requires stopping your Sourcegraph deployment which will result in downtime.\n\nAdditionally, once the upgrade process is started via the database container, interrupting the container before the upgrade is complete could result in corrupting the underlying Postgres database. We strongly advise taking a backup before the upgrade.\n\nFor instance specfic instructions on how to upgrade a builtin Postgres database via the image entrypoint script, see our instance specific operational instructions.\n\nWe have the following advisements to admins:\n\nContainer orchestration management systems (e.g. Kubernetes) may restart containers at any time, it is recommended that you take a backup of your database before starting the upgrade process.\n\nReview your deployment types upgrade notes before upgrading. The PostgreSQL upgrade process mutates the database schema in a way that may Sourcegraph v5.10.0 and v5.11.0 may not recognize. Learn more about pg12 to pg16 schema drift here.\n\nFor additional assistance with PostgreSQL upgrades, please contact [email protected].\n\nUpgrade entrypoint script options\n\nThe PG_UPGRADE_EXTRA_ARGS environment variable allows you to customize the pg_upgrade command in postgresql-16 and postgresql-16-codeinsights deployments.\n\nQuick upgrade option: Setting PG_UPGRADE_EXTRA_ARGS=--link creates hard links between old and new data directories instead of copying data. While faster and space-efficient, this method risks data corruption if containers are interrupted during an upgrade. It is best used when you have reliable container scheduling and solid backups.\n\nStorage requirements: Without --link, you'll need double the current database size in free disk space. For example, a 100GiB database requires an additional 100GiB free space for the upgrade.\n\nUpgrading external PostgreSQL instances\n\nWhen running an external PostgreSQL instance, please do the following:\n\nBack up the Postgres DB so that you can restore to the old version should anything go wrong.\n\nTurn off Sourcegraph entirely (bring down all containers and pods so they cannot talk to Postgres.)\n\nUpgrade Postgres to the latest version following your provider's instruction or your preferred method:\n\nAWS RDS\n\nAWS Aurora\n\nGCP CloudSQL\n\nAzure DB\n\nHeroku\n\nEnterpriseDB\n\nCitus\n\nAiven PostgreSQL\n\nYour own PostgreSQL\n\nTurn Sourcegraph back on connecting to the now-upgraded database.\n\nWARNING: Do not allow Sourcegraph to run/connect to the new Postgres database until it has been fully populated with your data. Doing so could result in Sourcegraph trying to create e.g. a new DB schema and partially migrating. If this happens to you, restore from the backup you previously took or contact us ([email protected])\n\nSingle-container Sourcegraph",

      "# [Metrics and dashboards](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/observability/metrics)\nSourcegraph ships with Grafana for dashboards, Prometheus for metrics and alerting. We also provide built-in alerting for these metrics.\n\nGrafana\n\nSite admins can view the Grafana monitoring dashboards on a Sourcegraph instance:\n\nGo to User menu > Site admin.\n\nOpen the Monitoring page from the link in the left sidebar. The URL is https://sourcegraph.example.com/-/debug/grafana/.\n\nDashboards\n\nA complete dashboard reference is available for more context on our available service dashboards and panels.\n\nAdditional dashboards can also be set up—see Grafana configuration for more details.\n\nView documentation\n\nOn service dashboards, each metric panel has links attached that lead to relevant alert solutions or panel documentation. These can be accessed from the top left corner of each panel.\n\nView alerts\n\nThe Overview dashboard includes a high-level summary of alert events across all Sourcegraph services.\n\nOn service dashboards, a summary of alert events for that service is available. Alerts can be filtered by level using the \"Filter alert level\" selector at the top of the dashboard. This information can be overlaid on all panels in that dashboard by enabling the \"Alert events\" toggle.\n\nView version change events\n\nOn service dashboards, annotations can be displayed for occasions when a Sourcegraph version change is detected by enabling the \"Version changes\" toggle at the top of the dashboard. This can be useful for correlating metrics and alerts with Sourcegraph deployment and upgrade events.\n\nQuerying metrics\n\nSpecific metrics can be queried using Grafana's Explore panel, available at /-/debug/grafana/explore on your Sourcegraph instance. The query for each individual panel can be viewed and explored by clicking on the panel and using the \"Explore\" option.\n\nGrafana configuration\n\nSourcegraph deploys a customized image of Grafana, which ships with Sourcegraph-specific dashboard definitions.\n\nTo provide custom dashboards, a directory containing dashboard JSON specifications can be mounted in the Docker container at /sg_grafana_additional_dashboards. Changes to files in that directory will be detected automatically while Grafana is running.\n\nMore behavior can be controlled with environmental variables.\n\nNOTE: There is a known issue where attempting to edit anything using the Grafana UI will result in a 403 response with \"invalid CSRF token\". As a workaround, site admins can connect to Grafana directly to make changes using the Grafana UI.\n\nAccessing Grafana directly\n\nFor most use cases, you can access Grafana through your Sourcegraph instance. Follow the instructions below to access Grafana directly to, for example, edit configuration directly.\n\nNOTE: Most of the dashboards that Sourcegraph ships with are not configurable through the Grafana UI. In general, we recommend these configuration methods instead.\n\nIf you are using the Kubernetes deployment option, you can access Grafana directly using Kubernetes port forwarding to your local machine:\n\nGrafana will be available http://localhost:3370/-/debug/grafana.\n\nIf you are using Docker Single Container or the Docker Compose deployment option, Grafana is available locally at http://localhost:3370/-/debug/grafana without any additional setup. If Sourcegraph is deployed to a remote server, then access via an SSH tunnel using a tool such as sshuttle is required to establish a secure connection to Grafana. To access the remote server using sshuttle from your local machine:\n\nGrafana will be available at http://host:3370/-/debug/grafana.\n\nGrafana security\n\nTo enable Grafana's built-in authentication, add GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED as false in the Grafana container's environment variables in your deployment override file, then redeploy the Grafana container.\n\nWe also recommend that you customize the default admin username and password.\n\nFor new deployments, configure the GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER and GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variables on the Grafana container, using your deployment pipeline's secrets management tool, before initial deployment, to initialize the default admin user on first deployment.\n\nFor existing deployments, you can either log in to the Grafana web UI with the default credentials and it will prompt you to change the password, or you can reinitialize Grafana:\n\nExport any customized dashboards via JSON (if applicable)\n\nConfigure the environment variables the same as a new instance\n\nDelete the Grafana container's storage volume\n\nRedeploy the Grafana container\n\nImport any customized dashboards (if applicable)\n\nThe contents of the Grafana container's storage volume are ephemeral, so metrics data is not lost in this process.\n\nPrometheus\n\nPrometheus is a monitoring tool that collects application- and system-level metrics over time and makes these accessible through a robust query language.\n\nFor most use cases, you can query Prometheus through Grafana using Grafana's Explore panel, available at /-/debug/grafana/explore on your Sourcegraph instance, or simply rely on the dashboards we ship.\n\nAvailable metrics\n\nHigh-level alerting metrics\n\nSourcegraph's metrics include a single high-level metric alert_count which indicates the number of level=critical and level=warning alerts each service has fired over time for each Sourcegraph service. This is the same metric presented on the Overview Grafana dashboard.\n\nNOTE: We provide built-in alerting for these alerting metrics to help monitor the health of your Sourcegraph instance. Refer to our alert solutions reference for details on specific alerts.\n\nDescription: The number of alerts each service has fired for a given alert name and severity level.\n\nValues: Although the values of alert_count are floating-point numbers, only their whole numbers have meaning. For example, 0.5 and 0.7 indicate no alerts are firing, while 1.2 indicates exactly one alert is firing and 3.0 indicates exactly three alerts firing.\n\nLabels:\n\nComplete reference\n\nA complete reference of Sourcegraph's vast set of Prometheus metrics is not yet available. If you are interested in this, please reach out by filing an issue or contacting us at [email protected].\n\nPrometheus configuration\n\nSourcegraph runs a customized image of Prometheus, which packages a standard Prometheus installation together with rules files and target files tailored to Sourcegraph and quality-of-life integrations such as the ability to configure alerting from the Sourcegraph web application.\n\nA directory can be mounted at /sg_prometheus_add_ons. It can contain additional config files of two types:\n\nrule files which must have the suffix _rules.yml in their filename (ie gitserver_rules.yml)\n\ntarget files which must have the suffix _targets.yml in their filename (ie local_targets.yml)\n\nRule files and target files must use the latest Prometheus 2.x syntax.\n\nThe environment variable PROMETHEUS_ADDITIONAL_FLAGS can be used to pass on additional flags to the prometheus executable running in the container.\n\nAccessing Prometheus directly\n\nMost of the time, Sourcegraph site admins will monitor and query key metrics through Grafana, rather than through Prometheus directly. Grafana also provides the dashboards that monitor the standard metrics that indicate the health of the instance. Follow the instructions below to access Prometheus directly instead.\n\nIf you are using the Kubernetes deployment option, port-forward the Prometheus service:\n\nIf you are using Docker Single Container or the Docker Compose deployment option, you will need to restart the Sourcegraph container with a flag --publish 9090:9090 in the docker run command.\n\nPrometheus will be available http://localhost:9090.\n\nUsing a custom monitoring system",

      "# [Syntax Highlighting by ichim-david on 2024-05-04](https://community.sourcegraph.com/t/syntax-highlighting/236)\nI have this extension, and it is active. I have several others as well that offer syntax highlighting. They work on the actual units, but not in the chat sessions where cody offers some code samples. They highlighting works in cody chat sessions with Javascript, python etc, just not Pascal. It’s not terrible, because any code that I save into a unit does get the highlighting from the extension. If the generated code in the chat sessions gets its syntax highlighting from the extensions then I guess the extension builders need to know it.\n\nThanks\n\nForgive me, didn’t think about that. Just out of curiosity can you share a screenshot of what it looks like in chat now?\n\nI will ask the product team if there is a way to add Pascal/Delphi highlighting. Pascal, man that takes me back to high school!\n\nAttachment added. It is just plain code style text, as one would expect without highlighting. Nothing awful, just not as nice.\n\nAs for Free Pascal, discovered it about 5 years ago. So much has changed. Is oop now, has generics, function references and targets many processor architectures: Intel x86 (16 and 32 bit), AMD64/x86-64, PowerPC, PowerPC64, SPARC, SPARC64, ARM, AArch64, MIPS, Motorola 68k, AVR, and the JVM. Supports all Windows (16/32/64 bit, CE, and native NT), Linux, Mac OS X/iOS/iPhoneSimulator/Darwin, FreeBSD and other BSD flavors, DOS (16 bit, or 32 bit DPMI), OS/2, AIX, Android, Haiku, Nintendo GBA/DS/Wii, AmigaOS, MorphOS, AROS, Atari TOS, and embedded platforms. I have remade arcade games with it and put them on gaming consoles, written code for the various Pi’s, Linux tools, etc. Very easy to use, compiles to reasonable sizes and doesn’t need a complicated setup like Python with env or conda. I even made a desktop client for chatGPT. I wrote my own highlighter for it because chatGPT doesn’t highlight pascal code either.\n\nOne last request, unless I just don’t know how to do this. Is it possible to have the chat sessions saved in markdown format? So far, they save to JSON which preserves all of the internal CODY instructions that I don’t need. I just need the human and assistant responses. I suppose I could write a separate application to read through and grab them, but there is a lot of extraneous display code that I would have to parse.\n\nThanks\n\n@jdorfman @IndyDev the syntax highlighting for chat is provided by this library.\n\nPreviously it was loaded using all syntax highlighters but due to increased bundle size the common option is now used.\n\nYou can see which languages are within this common option, for sure delphi is not one of them.\n\nThere are ways to register the syntax highlighting for extra languages but I assume that it’s a tradeoff between how many users need this feature and how much effort it is to support this.\n\nThe good thing about Cody is that it’s open source so if someone has a need to get Delphi syntax highlighting I think that pull requests are welcomed.\n\nPersonally, now that I’ve investigated this issue and seen another issue regarding the syntax highlighting color difference\n\nI wouldn’t be that bothered by the lack of syntax color because if you use the apply button or copy and paste the code in the editor window you will get the syntax highlighting from the editor but depending on how many times a day you use the chat functionality with a language that doesn’t have syntax highlighting it could be a problem.\n\nEDIT:\n\nStill it doesn’t hurt to flag this lack of syntax highlight and from here we shall see how Sourcegraph developers decide todo something about syntax highlighting support.",
      "# [Feature Request on 2024-12-10](https://community.sourcegraph.com/t/feature-request/1610)\nIt’s not that there is not enough demand, but if you make a plugin for Zed you will reach more users because Zed is more preferred than Vs Code (I prefer Zed too). I think it should be tried to reach more users.\n\nIMHO (just my personal thoughts), Zed should not be the main priority because of many reasons:\n\nZed has native AI features like recently introduced Zeta autocompletion and next edit prediction, also AI chat and some agentic features - so there is native implementation for the most things Cody could offer;\n\nAs far as I know then Zed extension API/implementations lacks a lot of features which would be needed for Cody functionality - currently most Zed extensons focuses on themes, language servers, slash commands and context servers. So even if it would be possible to implement Cody in Zed - that solution would be miles in different direction than the VSCode base version of Cody;\n\n“More preferred than VSCode” - that’s a very personal opinion, a lot of people prefer and use VSCode over Cursor or other IDEs/editors too. Zed, of course, is very fast and has some other cool features but it has a massive problem of extension ecosystem (lack of it; probably because of reason I mentioned in the 2. point). As you can see, lack of extensions (in this case - Cody) - actually is the main point of this post…\n\nAlso I think Cody already reaches a lot of users and developers - especially if the main focus is on Enterprise users.\n\nI am not against Zed or SG developing Cody extension for Zed but I see more risks than possible gains.",
      "# [Custom Commands on 2024-04-15](https://community.sourcegraph.com/t/custom-commands/122)\nThe generation of custom commands does not work well in VSCode.

Cody would then execute that prompt using the currently selected code.\n\nOr even better above the “Add Content” button\n\nYeah sorry about that misread the issue. It’s great feedback. I will make sure the product team sees this\n\nHave you tried keyboard shortcuts?\n\n@SphaeroX, we have a new feature that allows you to add the selected code to the chat view with right-click (Cody Chat: add as context) so that you can type your prompt directly in the chat box. Would that be a good workaround for your use case here?\n\nThank you very much, I already use that and think it’s great.\n\nBut the problem is that I can’t select and use than my custom commands.

      "# [Private network configuration](https://5.6.sourcegraph.com/admin/config/private-network)\nA private network refers to a secure network environment segregated from the public internet, designed to facilitate internal communications and operations within an organization. This network setup restricts external access, enhancing security and control over data flow by limiting exposure to external threats and unauthorized access.\n\nWhen deploying self-hosted Sourcegraph instances in private networks with specific compliance and policy requirements, additional configuration may be required to ensure all networking features function correctly. The reasons for applying the following configuration options depend on the specific functionality of the Sourcegraph service and the unique network and infrastructure requirements of the organization.\n\nThe following is a list of Sourcegraph services and how and when each initiates outbound connections to external services:\n\nfrontend: The frontend service communicates externally when connecting to external auth providers, sending telemetry data, testing code host connections, and connecting to externally hosted Sourcegraph services\n\ngitserver: Executes git commands against externally hosted code hosts\n\nrepo-updater: Communicates with code hosts APIs to coordinate repository synchronization\n\nmigrator: Connects to Postgres instances (which may be externally hosted) to process database migrations\n\nexecutor: Sourcegraph Executor batch change or precise indexing jobs may need to connect to services hosted within an organization's private network\n\nHTTP proxy configuration\n\nAll Sourcegraph services respect the conventional HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, and NO_PROXY environment variables for routing Sourcegraph client application HTTP traffic through a proxy server. The steps for configuring proxy environment variables will depend on your Sourcegraph deployment method.\n\nKubernetes Helm\n\nAdd the proxy environment variables to your Sourcegraph Helm chart override file:\n\nUsing private CA root certificates\n\nSome organizations maintain a private Certificate Authority (CA) for issuing certificates within their private network. When Sourcegraph connects to TLS encrypted service using a self-signed certificate that it does not trust, you will observe an x509: certificate signed by unknown authority error message in logs.\n\nIn order for Sourcegraph to respect an organization's self-signed certificates, the private CA root certificate(s) will need to be appended to Sourcegraph's trusted CA root certificate list in /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt.\n\nConfiguring sourcegraph-frontend to recognize private CA root certificates\n\nThe following details the process for setting up the sourcegraph-frontend to acknowledge and trust a private CA root certificate for Sourcegraph instances deployed using Helm. For any other Sourcegraph service that needs to trust an organization's private CA root certificate (including gitserver, repo-updater, or migrator), similar steps will need to be followed.\n\nCopy out the existing ca-certificates.crt file from the sourcegraph-frontend container:\n\nConcatenate the private CA root certificate to the sourcegraph-frontend-ca-certificates.crt file:\n\nCreate a new Kubernetes ConfigMap containing the concatenated ca-certificates.crt file:\n\nMount the sourcegraph-frontend-ca-certificates ConfigMap to the sourcegraph-frontend Deployment:\n\nOnce deployed, you should see the private CA root certificate in the sourcegraph-frontend container's /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt file."

And every single symbol (variable name, method/fn name, class name, constant, etc.) is linked to all references to that symbol. So e.g. you can just click any class or method and see every single usage of that class or method or constant across the entire codebase (every single google project, every single dependency, every single language, etc....). Its also tied in with our build system (internally called blaze or externally called bazel), so you can e.g. load proto file in the browser and then see all generated sources from that file (like the Java, js, c++, or python class from protoc) even though they don't actually exist on disk.\n\nMostly it's the search that is amazing, e.g.\n\nhttps://cs.opensource.google/search?q=lang:java%20OutputStream%20-f:Test%20&ss=protobuf%2Fprotobuf\n\nCode search exposes predicates that show understandings of the language. e.g. you can avoid matching string in a code comment but using the \"usage:\" predicate.\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/code-search/reference\n\nThe tools scale so that a single project can easily have thousands of files and large teams (100s of SWEs) can remotely collaborate efficiently.\n\nWe also have our code review tool, internally called critique. That exposes it's own search indices for searching all (un)submitted changes, e.g. search all changes from Jan 1 to Feb 3, on files matching .*Foo.java, with change text \"bar\", under path a/b/c. This really helps bisecting regressions.\n\nHonestly, the tooling makes me 10x more efficient than I am otherwise on my own.\n\n## Comment ID i01in3p with +1 score by [(quetejodas, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i01in3p/) (in reply to ID tahdd2):\nAgent Ransack\n\n## Comment ID i01m72n with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i01m72n/) (in reply to ID tahdd2):\nMost of it I do in VSCode and IDE but sometimes I use Meld for change detection and the good old `find -iname` plus a ton of either bash or half-baked Python.\n\n## Comment ID i01n3ws with +1 score by [(Isvara, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i01n3ws/) (in reply to ID tahdd2):\nhttps://elixir.bootlin.com/\n\n## Comment ID i01xvoc with +1 score by [(pancakeQueue, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i01xvoc/) (in reply to ID tahdd2):\nThe VSCode extension GitLens is fantastic.

To answer your question:\n\n- You get the IDE features on your codehost. So you can find references inside of a pull request/etc.\n\n- You don't need to have a checkout / switch branches (can be costly depending on your dev env / dev scale)\n\n- We focus on cross repository tools. IDEs are usually work within a project context.\n\nPersonally I use the text search a _lot_, even though I could just use my editor.

      "# Post ID 1ftt6sf: Sourcebot, an open-source Sourcegraph alternative with +72 score by [(lowpolydreaming, Reddit, 2024-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1ftt6sf/sourcebot_an_opensource_sourcegraph_alternative/)\nHi, we’re Brendan and Michael, the creators of Sourcebot ([https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot)). Sourcebot is an open-source code search tool that allows you to quickly search across many large codebases. Check out our demo video here: [https://youtu.be/mrIFYSB\\_1F4](https://youtu.be/mrIFYSB_1F4), or try it for yourself here on our demo site: [https://demo.sourcebot.dev](https://demo.sourcebot.dev)\n\nWhile at prior roles, we’ve both felt the pain of searching across hundreds of multi-million line codebases. Using local tools like grep were ill-suited since you often only had a handful of codebases checked out at a time. [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/) solves this issue by indexing a collection of codebases in the background and exposing a web-based search interface. It is the de-facto search solution for medium to large orgs, but is often cited as expensive ($49 per user / month) and recently went [closed source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41296481). That’s why we built Sourcebot.\n\nWe designed Sourcebot to be:\n\n* **Easily deployed:** we provide a single, self-contained [Docker image](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot/pkgs/container/sourcebot).\n* **Fast & scalable:** designed to minimize search times (current average is \\~73ms) across many large repositories.\n* **Cross code-host support:** we currently support syncing public & private repositories in GitHub and GitLab.\n* **Quality UI:** we like to think that a good looking dev-tool is more pleasant to use.\n* **Open source:** Sourcebot is free to use by anyone.\n\nUnder the hood, we use [Zoekt](https://github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt) as our code search engine, which was originally authored by Han-Wen Nienhuys and now [maintained by Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/sourcegraph-accepting-zoekt-maintainership). Zoekt works by building a trigram index from the source code enabling extremely fast regular expression matching. Russ Cox has a great [article](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html) on how trigram indexes work if you’re interested.\n\nIn the shorter-term, there are several improvements we want to make, like:\n\n* Improving how we communicate indexing progress (this is currently non-existent so it’s not obvious how long things will take)\n* UX improvements like search history, query syntax highlighting & suggestions, etc.\n* Small QOL improvements like bookmarking code snippets.\n* Support for more code hosts (e.g., BitBucket, SourceForge, ADO, etc.)\n\nIn the longer-term, we want to investigate how we could go beyond just traditional code search by leveraging machine learning to enable experiences like semantic code search (“where is system X located?”) and code explanations (”how does system X interact with system Y?”). You could think of this as a copilot being embedded into Sourcebot. Our hunch is that will be useful to devs, especially when packaged with the traditional code search, but let us know what you think.\n\nGive it a try: [https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot).

Cody (from Sourcegraph) provides an interface that let's you choose from any of 3.5 Sonnet (default), 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4o and Mixtral 8x22B among others. You can freely switch among them on a prompt by prompt basis.\n\nThe interface supports chats, inline prompting, and autocomplete suggestions. About the only downside I've encountered so far is that it limits the conversation context to 15K tokens + 45K tokens from source files you reference with the prompt and the output is limited to 4k tokens per query.\n\nI got curious about Claude Projects after running into those limits in a very long chat with 3.5 Sonnet. Cody is clever about windowing the chat, I only discovered it when asking Sonnet to fill in some specific details in a summary outline of the chat and it admitted it no longer had access to them.  Other than that, 3.5 Sonnet + Cody + VSCode has been truly transformative for my projects - and it's only $9 per month.\n\nSo for very long chats, I'm just now experimenting with Projects. I'm wondering what it can do better than Cody to justify continuing my $20/month subscription.\n\n(note: I have absolutely no personal or financial affiliation with either product)\n\n## Comment ID lhfzl03 with +12 score by [(pegunless, Reddit, 2024-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1eou6cj/claude_project_vs_cody/lhfzl03/) (in reply to ID 1eou6cj):\nSourcegraph marketing folks are getting pretty shameless with the advertising here.

I use Cody when I reach my limit on the Claude Pro. In general I've found Claude Pro is more willing to offer extensive answers and to work hard. Cody seems to be programmed to keep it brief (which is understandable as they are paying for the expensive API). So, when I use Cody I find myself focusing on smaller tasks, and I have the big thinking and broader coding talks for Claude Pro. I do use Claude Sonnet 3.5 through Cody, so I still find it very intelligent and capable, just not as willing to do long outputs or deeper thinking.",
      "# Post ID 1bdtrjq: Wrangling 2000 Git Repos at Reddit with +120 score by [(SussexPondPudding, Reddit, 2024-03-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1bdtrjq/wrangling_2000_git_repos_at_reddit/)\n*Written by Scott Reisor*\n\nI’m Scott and I work in Developer Experience at Reddit. Our teams maintain the libraries and tooling that support many platforms of development: backend, mobile, and web.\n\nThe source code for all this development is currently spread across more than 2000 git repositories. Some of these repos are small microservice repos maintained by a single team, while others, like our mobile apps, are larger mono-repos that multiple teams build together. It may sound absurd to have more repositories than we do engineers, but segmenting our code like this comes with some big benefits:\n\n* Teams can autonomously manage the development and deployment of their own services\n* Library owners can release new versions without coordinating changes across the entire codebase\n* Developers don’t need to download every line ever written to start working\n* Access management is simple with per-repo permissions\n\nOf course, there are always downsides to any approach. Today I’m going to share some of the ways we wrangle this mass of repos, in particular how we used Sourcegraph to manage the complexity.\n\n# Code Search\n\nTo start, it can be a challenge to search for code across 2000+ repos. Our repository host provides some basic search capabilities, but it doesn’t do a great job of surfacing relevant results. If I know where to start looking, I can clone the repo and search it locally with tools like grep (or [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for those of culture). But at Reddit I can also open up [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/).\n\nSourcegraph is a tool we host internally that provides an intelligent search for our decentralized code base with powerful regex and filtering support. We have it set up to index code from all our 2000 repositories (plus some public repos we depend on). All of our developers have access to Sourcegraph’s web UI to search and browse our codebase.\n\nAs an example, let’s say I’m building a new HTTP backend service and want to inject some middleware to parse custom headers rather than implementing that in each endpoint handler. We have libraries that support these common use cases, and if I look up the middleware package on our internal Godoc service, I can find a Wrap funcion that sounds like what I need to inject middleware. Unfortunately, these docs don’t currently have useful examples on how Wrap is actually used.\n\nI can turn to Sourcegraph to see how other people have used the Wrap function in their latest code. A simple query for middleware.Wrap returns plain text matches across all of Reddit’s code base in milliseconds. This is just a very basic search, but Sourcegraph has an extensive [query syntax](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/code-search/queries) that allows you to fine-tune results and combine filters in powerful ways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v9rifbcdy3oc1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=9da24ba688173e2b8336e0acaae1052084d1c5ab\n\nThese first few results are from within our httpbp framework, which is probably a good example of how it’s used. If we click into one of the results, we can read the full context of the usage in an IDE-like file browser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/59wcd8niy3oc1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=603b692cbfb4ce3fc8b5822b551364cd0f805162\n\nAnd by IDE-like, I really mean it. If I hover over symbols in the file, I’ll see tooltips with docs and the ability to jump to other references:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lj4c9aany3oc1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=81cec096a401c19feb4501d919aa0c8b86d75a66\n\nThis is super powerful, and allows developers to do a lot of code inspection and discovery without cloning repos locally. The browser is ideal for our mobile developers in particular. When comparing implementations across our iOS and Android platforms, mobile developers don’t need to have both Xcode and Android Studio setup to get IDE-like file browsing, just the tool for the platform they’re actively developing. It’s also amazing when you’re responding to an incident while on-call. Being able to hunt through code like this is a huge help when debugging.\n\nSome of this IDE-like functionality does depend on an additional [precise code index](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/code_navigation/explanations/precise_code_navigation) to work, which, unfortunately, Soucegraph does not generate automatically. We have CI setup to generate these indexes on some of our larger/more impactful repositories, but it does mean these features aren’t currently available across our entire codebase.\n\n# Code Insights\n\nAt Reddit scale, we are always working on strategic migrations and maturing our infrastructure. This means we need an accurate picture of what our codebase looks like at any point in time. Sourcegraph aids us here with their Code Insights features, helping us visualize migrations and dependencies, code smells and adoption patterns.\n\nStraight searching can certainly be helpful here. It’s great for designing new API abstractions or checking that you don’t repeat yourself with duplicate libraries. But sometimes you need a higher level overview of how your libraries are put to use. Without all our code available locally, it’s difficult to run custom scripting to get these sorts of usage analytics.\n\nSourcegraph’s ability to aggregate queries makes it easy to audit where certain libraries are being used. If, say, I want to track the adoption of the v2 version of our httpbp framework, I can query for all repos that import the new package. Here the select:repo aggregation causes a single result to be returned for each repo that matches the query:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4mky24ty3oc1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=1487848495f1093d7b769c81fea8c6a379183d9f\n\nThis gives me a simple list of all the repos currently referencing the new library, and the result count at the top gives me a quick summary of adoption. Results like this aren’t always best suited for a UI, so my team often runs these kinds of queries with the [Sourcegraph CLI](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cli) which allows us to parse results out of a JSON formatted response.\n\nWhile these aggregations can be great for a snapshot of the current usage, they really get powerful when leveraged as part of [Code Insights](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/code_insights). This is a feature of Sourcegraph that lets you build dashboards with graphs that track changes over time. Sourcegraph will take a query and run it against the history of your codebase. For example, that query above looks like this for over the past 12 months, illustrating healthy adoption of the v2 library:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x62o2ubbe4oc1.png?width=446&format=png&auto=webp&s=1164cc29ad655d4e708a21705fc179c0bea5ddf5\n\nThis kind of *insight* has been hugely beneficial in tracking the success of certain projects. Our Android team has been tracking the [adoption of new GraphQL APIs](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/18aptg2/reddit_recap_state_of_mobile_platforms_edition/) while our Web UI team has been tracking the [adoption of our Design System (RPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/17kxwri/from_chaos_to_cohesion_reddits_design_system_story/)). Adding new code doesn’t necessarily mean progress if we’re not cleaning up the old code. That’s why we like to track adoption alongside removal where possible. We love to see graphs with Xs like this in our dashboards, representing modernization along with legacy tech-debt cleanup.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pg66sn8he4oc1.png?width=446&format=png&auto=webp&s=b78e0596808ce44909728b29fa58511a58282b4b\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCode Insights are just a part of how we track these migrations at Reddit. We have metrics in Grafana and event data in BigQuery that also help track not just source code, but what’s actually running in prod. Unfortunately Sourcegraph doesn’t provide a way to mix these other data sources in its dashboards. It’d be great if we could embed these graphs in our Grafana dashboards or within Confluence documents.\n\n# Batch Changes\n\nOne of the biggest challenges of any multi-repo setup is coordinating updates across the entire codebase. It’s certainly nice as library maintainers to be able to release changes without needing to update [everything everywhere all at once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6ie3PEmAr4&t=62s), but if not all at once, then when? Our developers enjoy the flexibility to adopt new versions at their own pace, but if old versions languish for too long it can become a support burden on our team.\n\nTo help with simple dependency updates, many teams leverage [Renovate](https://www.mend.io/renovate/) to automatically open pull requests with new package versions. This is generally pretty great! Most of the time teams get small PRs that don’t require any additional effort on their part, and they can happily keep up with the latest versions of our libraries. Sometimes, however, a breaking API change gets pushed out that requires manual intervention to resolve. This can range anywhere from annoying to a crippling time sink. It’s these situations that we look towards Sourcegraph’s [Batch Changes](https://sourcegraph.com/batch-changes).\n\nBatch Changes allow us to write scripts that run against some (or all) of our repos to make automated changes to code. These changes are defined in a metadata file that sets the spec for how changes are applied and the pull request description that repo owners will see when the change comes in. We currently need to rely on the Sourcegraph CLI to actually run the spec, which will download code and run the script locally. This can take some time to run, but once it’s done we can preview changes in the UI before opening pull requests against the matching repos. The preview gives us a chance to modify and rerun the batch before the changes are in front of repo owners.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ovf6dufoe4oc1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=dad15c22ff4e1dfb8808001420722b43d31735a1\n\nThe above shows a Batch Change that’s actively in progress. Our Release Infrastructure team has been going through the process of moving deployments off of Spinnaker, our legacy deployment tool. The changeset attempts to convert existing Spinnaker config to instead use our new Drone deployment pipelines. This batch matched over 100 repos and we’ve so far opened 70 pull requests, which we’re able to track with a handy burndown chart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n67w0u65f4oc1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=c928efb028a4d971e033eb409af983b89a1c841b\n\nSourcegraph can’t coerce our developers into merging these changes, teams are ultimately still responsible for their own codebases, but the burndown gives us a quick overview of how the change is being adopted. Sourcegraph does give us the ability to bulk-add comments on the open pull requests to give repo owners a nudge. If there ends up being some stragglers after the change has been out for a bit, the burndown gives us insight to escalate with those repo owners more directly.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWrangling 2000+ repos has its challenges, but Sourcegraph has helped to make it way easier for us to manage. Code Search gives all of our developers the power to quickly scour across our entire codebase and browse results in an IDE-like web UI. Code Insights gives our platform teams a high level overview of their strategic migrations. And Batch Changes provide a powerful mechanism to enact these migrations with minimal effort on individual repo owners.\n\nThere’s yet more juice for us to squeeze out of Sourcegraph. We look forward to updating our deployment with [executors](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/executors) which should allow us to run Batch Changes right from the UI and automate more of our precise code indexing. I also expect my team will also find some good usages for [code monitoring](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/code_monitoring) in the near future as we deprecate some APIs.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n## Comment ID kw2vzw8 with +4 score by [(ZyanCarl, Reddit, 2024-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1bdtrjq/wrangling_2000_git_repos_at_reddit/kw2vzw8/) (in reply to ID 1bdtrjq):\nAt what point do you think it’s easier to rewrite everything and organise everything properly to support repo explosion than to keep on adding on top of everything? Because on every update for mobile, there are some parts that still gets missed so I assume there’s so much dead code in all of 2000+ repos.\n\nExamples: after one of the updates turned swiping up for next video to swiping right, the pop up for network issues still mentions “network issue. Swipe up for next video”. And sometimes on anonymous mode, these changes doesn’t reflect and they seem to be one step behind. Not sure if it’s a A/B testing thing but doesn’t make sense to A/B test between modes in same app.\n\n### Comment ID kw3g4j0 with +3 score by [(Taco-Byte, Reddit, 2024-03-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1bdtrjq/wrangling_2000_git_repos_at_reddit/kw3g4j0/) (in reply to ID kw2vzw8):\nAside from the fact that it will never be easier to rewrite all of Reddit (pretty much impossible at that scale)\n\nI don’t think a mono repo would solve the example you described. You’re probably correct the behavior change is behind some feature flag / AB test, but I think that’s just a small over sight that the copy still says “swipe up” instead of checking if the new behavior is enabled. All software that changes this rapidly is going to have bugs and inconsistencies.\n\nIf it is a gated behavior, that’s exactly why incremental roll outs exists. Someone like you will notice the issue and report it and they can fix it before pushing the new behavior globally. Or users can say they hate it and Reddit can pivot instead of investing more resources on the experiment.\n\n## Comment ID kvh9ydw with +2 score by [(Beneficial_Stand2230, Reddit, 2024-03-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1bdtrjq/wrangling_2000_git_repos_at_reddit/kvh9ydw/) (in reply to ID 1bdtrjq):\nQuestion: have you guys evaluated GitLab?\n\n## Comment ID kvhw8e5 with +2 score by [(qrush, Reddit, 2024-03-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1bdtrjq/wrangling_2000_git_repos_at_reddit/kvhw8e5/) (in reply to ID 1bdtrjq):\nWhy did Reddit choose Sourcegraph over Github?

Git itself has adopted new features to assist this, and source control vendors like GitHub and GitLab have more useful features.\n\nCreating more repos creates more complexity without necessarily adding value commensurate to the complexity. Yes, you gain agency and independence for your code, but you now have an additional burdens. Additional work is required to onboard developers to additional repos; standardization is harder (if not impossible); Shift Left is much more difficult; sharing code is more difficult; tracking dependencies is more difficult; integrating and testing code across many components is more difficult; etc.\n\nTo create more value with less effort, use fewer repositories that cover more code, reduce administrative burden by granting more access with fewer requirements, and provide more quality gates earlier in development cycles. Simultaneously assuring quality and accelerating integration earlier in the product development lifecycle reduces cost and speeds up the overall engineering effort. This applies whether your scale is 1 team or 100; it's just more noticeable at higher scales.\n\n## Comment ID kw5790o with +1 score by [(heraldev, Reddit, 2024-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1bdtrjq/wrangling_2000_git_repos_at_reddit/kw5790o/) (in reply to ID 1bdtrjq):\nWhat do you think about migrating to monorepo in the future?

The last interview I had with them was pretty conversational.  I had a background in some of the problems they were working on and during the conversation I brought up a sort of improvement/trick I had figured out in the past and the interviewer said it was something they had never considered before and seemed really interested in it which I thought was a good sign.  But unfortunately they ghosted me after that.  But here's the crazy part.  Sourcegraph has some open source repos and out of curiosity I decided to look at one the other day.  I looked at a few of the recent PRs and one of them caught my eye.  The PR was the EXACT improvement/trick that I brought up in my interview.  I look at who created the PR and, of course, it was the guy who interviewed me.  I looked at the date and it was about a week after my interview happened.  So this place ghosted me AND used me for free consulting.

However, there are a couple of things to consider. First, people throw out ideas all the time. If your interviewer got a way to improve the code base from you, there’s no reason to not make that improvement. It’s not like you’re there to make it yourself. They’re not going to let their product remain suboptimal for no reason. Second, they most likely had no input into whether you were ghosted; that’s on your recruiter.

If you're an open source maintainer, you can index your project on a regular basis (e.g. for every commit, or nightly) in CI, and access precise navigation on Sourcegraph.com after uploading the index. This can be helpful when collaborating (e.g. sharing links to code when discussing issues) and on-boarding new contributors.\n\nThe closest public code search tool that's similar to this is Chromium's code search.

Work upstream to add support for another index format. - One of the main requirements we had was robustness even in the presence of failures (e.g. if an indexer bug caused a crash). So I wanted to use multi-processing with IPC instead of multi-threading for parallelism. Right now, we're using `boost::interprocess` for that, but LLVM generally doesn't add third-party dependencies lightly. Some more reasons on not working directly in upstream are mentioned in [my discourse comment](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/announcing-scip-clang-a-new-indexer-for-c-and-c-based-on-clang/70686) under \"Thoughts on upstreaming the indexer\".\n\n2. Work in a fork of LLVM and modify clangd for our needs - LLVM HEAD moves very quickly, which adds a fair bit of extra work. We actually took this approach with our old indexer lsif-clang, but rebasing the code after changes upstream requires constant legwork. I generally think working in a fork of LLVM is the worst of both worlds, especially if you have limited engineering bandwidth. Better to either work upstream directly, or consume Clang/LLVM APIs \"as-is\" from upstream.\n\n3. Use clangd as a library downstream, instead of directly using Clang - This could've potentially worked, but the problem is that it adds one more layer of indirection for understanding and debugging, which isn't necessarily a win just to get some more code reuse. I've read through some of the clangd code to see if we should adjust our own code. E.g. this bug fix is based on how clangd handles unresolved dependent names: https://github.com/sourcegraph/scip-clang/pull/321\n\n### Comment ID jkuasdf with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/13jobc6/scipclang_a_new_code_indexer_for_c/jkuasdf/) (in reply to ID jkg6vrk):\nis it possible to use this from more traditional environments f.e emacs ? i am using eglot+clangd combo, with a healthy mix of ripgrep and friends (for those cases when clangd is not enough)\n\nunfortunately, with c++’s complexity cscope and other simpler indexers are not viable, so something like clangd or what you have described here is needed.\n\n#### Comment ID jkvnl3t with +2 score by [(typesanitizer, Reddit, 2023-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/13jobc6/scipclang_a_new_code_indexer_for_c/jkvnl3t/) (in reply to ID jkuasdf):\nWe haven't really looked into direct editor integration. Sourcegraph does have editor extensions for VS Code and IntelliJ, and one my colleagues was hacking on one for NeoVim. https://github.com/sourcegraph/sg.nvim\n\nThe idea behind these is that they complement the functionality in your editor rather than actually replacing what existing language servers do. E.g. this means better navigation for projects which have been indexed on Sourcegraph.com (or whichever Sourcegraph instance you're using), but not necessarily on your local machine, and integrating search with open-source repos everywhere (instead of limiting them to your machine).\n\nFrom a purely code editing perspective for a project that you're hacking on, since you already have clangd, it's difficult for scip-clang to provide a significant improvement over that, since they're both relying on the same Clang APIs. For smaller improvements, they'd likely live in the code navigation choices/defaults rather than the actual index data itself. clangd handles both the generation of index data and navigation, scip-clang only handles generating the index.",
      "# Post ID sowwe7: We made an extension to search and navigate 2+ million open source repositories within VS Code with +109 score by [(tjkandala, Reddit, 2022-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/vscode/comments/sowwe7/we_made_an_extension_to_search_and_navigate_2/)\n\n\n## Comment ID hwbn8t2 with +14 score by [(tjkandala, Reddit, 2022-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/vscode/comments/sowwe7/we_made_an_extension_to_search_and_navigate_2/hwbn8t2/) (in reply to ID sowwe7):\nHey r/vscode, I’m a developer at Sourcegraph and I’m excited to announce our [new VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.sourcegraph) that brings our powerful code search and intelligence to your editor. Don't let the following wall of text scare you; most of you will just have to install the extension and start searching!\n\n---\n\nBefore I joined Sourcegraph, code search wasn’t on my radar. Since I’ve been here, however, it has become an indispensable tool in my toolbox. Now, being able to use Sourcegraph in my editor, without having to context switch to a browser, has made me even more effective. Here are some use cases where I find Sourcegraph to be very helpful:\n\n- Search [“the universe of open source code”](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/why-index-the-oss-universe/): We’re planning to migrate this project from webpack to esbuild. I used the query `select:repo esbuild and importScripts(` to find other projects that have handled loading Web Workers using esbuild.\n- Search your team’s code: if you’ve [added your private repositories to Sourcegraph.com](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/how-to/adding_repositories_to_cloud) or you have a [self-hosted Sourcegraph instance](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install), you can easily search over them with this extension. I find myself using this extension over even native VS Code search for the open workspace to take advantage of our powerful [query language](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/reference/queries) and syntax-highlighted search results. \n- Check out more use cases in our [launch blog post](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/ways-to-use-sourcegraph-extension-for-vs-code)\n\nHere are some workflow tips:\n\n- Use `cmd+shift+8`/`cmd+*` (`ctrl` for Windows/Linux) to search selected text, or just focus the search tab if there are no selections. If you search a *lot*, you could maintain an [editor group](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_editor-groups) with your local files in one group and the Sourcegraph search tab and remote files in another group.\n- If you’re using this for work, I recommend creating a [search context](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/introducing-search-contexts/) to scope your searches to relevant repositories. You can switch to the `global` search context when you’re working on open source projects :)\n- Quickly share links to the currently viewed file, whether it is local or remote, by opening the command palette and running the `\"Copy Sourcegraph File Link\"` command.\n\n**Fun tech demo**: [cross-repo navigation through remote files thanks to our amazing code intel team, watch in HD](https://gfycat.com/earlyalivefeline). \n\n---\n\n**What can we do for you?**\n\nOur ultimate goal is to make it so everyone can code, and that starts with making tools that make developers like you and me more productive. What kind of features could we add to this extension that would help you day-to-day? \n\n([source code](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@tjk/vsce-search-ui/-/blob/client/vscode/src/extension.ts))\n\n### Comment ID hwcm2x6 with +4 score by [(ryan_the_leach, Reddit, 2022-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/vscode/comments/sowwe7/we_made_an_extension_to_search_and_navigate_2/hwcm2x6/) (in reply to ID hwbn8t2):\nThis seems cool and all, but it also seems a really fast way to get you to end up on the pointy end of the GPL license...

Had a lot of errors during the build state. Decided to look at the source code to solve the problems and try to help maintainers with figuring what's wrong - found a lot of TODOs about problems I have... Seems to me that writing an issue is now pointless because, well, problems are known. It's just Windows is low priority and is not tested.\n\nAfter manually unpackaging I got errors about needed files missing. I glanced through code more and found out that my binaries don't pass because they have \\`.exe\\` at the end. I thought maybe only error handling is wrong here. But duplicating files without extension didn't help: it seems plugin calls non-exe variants. At that moment I honestly depleted all my motivation to look further. Hope my experience can help someone.\n\nAside from technical issues, I think better explanation about login would help a lot. Took me a lot of time to figure out where to get a personal token and I had to read a documentation about \\`src-cli\\` to understand what is \\`SRC\\_ENDPOINT\\` is (still don't quite get it, but at least [`https://sourcegpraph.com`](https://sourcegpraph.com`) passed).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aw48gj57gmkb1.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=8111ce0342c8c180ce134dee5bae52f9b5883994\n\n### Comment ID jy1b8oa with +1 score by [(I_Am_Nerd, Reddit, 2023-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1616747/any_feedback_on_the_sourcegraph_cody_plugin/jy1b8oa/) (in reply to ID jxxt8bg):\nHey, Thanks for the comment!

Since then, there has been no sense of safety or longevity. You clock in each day with the idea that it could be your last.\n\nThe smartest leaders were shown the door, and the ones that kept their jobs were the loyalists to the exec suite's ideas, no matter how weak or deranged. The exec suite thought it was a good idea to change what we sold and for how much every few months, then berated teams for not hitting quota (which was next to impossible when there was no direction). \n\nThis environment quickly spiraled in to the Hunger Games. Exec meetings became tense and the ICs felt the trickle down as managers threw their own people under the bus. The calibration cycle almost a year ago was incredibly brutal, built solely on an agenda to make as many top performers quit as possible to save some cash. \n\nWhat used to make this place worthwhile (location-agnostic pay, work-life balance) doesn't exist anymore. Instead, you'll join a company that gets off on backstabbing, steamrolling, and punishment. The bad managers do nothing but gaslight and indulge in toxicity with their direct reports. They play favorites and if you're not in the \"in\" club, you'll be shown the pink slip soon enough. The ones that \"succeed\" here are the \"yes\" men (and yes, it is mostly men since DEI isn't a priority anymore) and the ones that are willing to put their health, mental state, and/or personal life on the line in order to get ahead for a company that will quickly lose the AI race to any number of stronger giants. Working late nights and weekends is the rule, not the exception, but they'll lead with their \"work from anywhere\" culture in interviews to make it seem reasonable. \n\nIt does not matter if you've been successful at Sourcegraph or have hit your goals consistently quarter after quarter. If they decide that they don't like you, you'll be gaslit, punished, and eventually pushed to leave.\n\nThey hire some of the smartest people that I've ever met, but they abuse them to the point that the best friends I made at Sourcegraph were due to trauma bonding together.",

Why were opt-outs in prod/engineering disproportionately female relative to the rest of prod/engineering? Define the culture you actual want, and why, and make decisions accordingly. The company is far too directionless, which is a real shame because the product is awesome. Who are you? Who do you want to be? How will you get there? Continue to be fully transparent with new hires about the challenges and opportunities. Obviously the recent spike in reviews tells you company culture change is happening and acknowledged internally - how will you position that to candidates?",

          "cons": "Sourcegraph is making a conscious effort to change it's culture by encouraging people to be \"scrappy,\" operate in ambiguity, and by discouraging \"Entitlement\" to information about company direction, and the \"why\" behind decisions. Within this change in culture, there exists great opportunity for individuals who are looking for opportunities to make big impact and advance quickly in their careers by taking on a ton of responsibility. This is a founder-led organization, where the founders expect everyone to give as much time and effort possible to Sourcegraph - they are understandably completely invested in the product and expect the same of Teammates. You will be expected to embrace The Grind of start up life.. You will feel like you have to be responsive at all times because \"asynchronous\" culture results in a lot of evening, weekend, and holiday work (BTW many roles are pulled into tons of meetings). It's important to understand what \"be flexible\" means in the context of a lot of these reviews - be ready for quick changes in direction, because there is a serious lack of commitment to long-term plans. The 30 day minimum PTO requirement is great, in theory, but not enforced or monitored in any way. Lastly, despite being a high performer (and rewarded as such), I felt this was a place where the consequences of making a mistake were high, particularly when interacting with senior leadership. I witnessed individuals very abruptly go from being valued contributors to sidelined. Most top performers do not have families, and those who do have a partner that does care taking. Ask questions during the interview process about what's important to you - you will get straightforward answers from most hiring managers. Know that \"scrappy\" is code for working a lot, \"high performance culture\" means taking direction well, and being \"flexible\" equates to frequently changing direction or doing things very last-minute based on arbitrary deadlines.",

They are doing remote work the right way, with 2x per year company meet ups in awesome locations, a generous office set up stipend, a cell phone/internet stipend, and reimbursement for co-working space. Depending on your team, the PTO policy is good (depending on role, expect to check in on slack/email/get texts on occasion while on vacation, though). There is a huge opportunity here for people willing to devote a ton of their lives to work - and leadership is making intentional steps to foster that environment. The handbook is awesome, and internal processes are documented well, although it can be information overload. The company uses Slack heavily (a pro, in my book, provided you are comfortable with wading through large amounts of information and being tagged in tons of CYA-type posts). I did not appreciate the culture shift that happened after I joined, where leadership doesn't care about people who were good at their jobs choosing to leave, so I left quickly myself. I'm great at what I do and therefore do not need to work for a company that doesn't value good management, promotes competition between team members, and doesn't respect work/life boundaries. But, on the flip side, I learned a TON and had the opportunity to work on a lot of cool stuff - that's why this is in the pros. Also, most of the people I worked with were genuinely awesome. Sourcegraph does know how to hire great people. I loved how international the team is - so cool to work with people from all over on a near-daily basis.",

As a company, we have ambitious goals, and there’s room for everyone to step up, own business-critical projects, and have a voice in tackling complex challenges. There really aren’t any barriers to entry. You’re much more likely to be pushed outside your comfort zone than to ever feel like you’re stuck working on things that aren’t important and don’t challenge you (and who wants that?). Expectations are high, but you get the support that you need when you ask for it. People are always happy to help, and everyone I’ve worked with here–from the exec team to managers to ICs–is really nice, and really smart. I’m constantly inspired by my colleagues. Regardless of their level, everyone feels accessible. I really appreciate the flexibility to work when it makes the most sense for me. So long as I’m delivering high quality work and am able to collaborate effectively, nobody really cares when I’m at my desk. And I feel comfortable taking time off to reset when I need it.",

          "advice": "Engineering culture is getting a rebuild. Yay! Lots of growing pains there but I am excited to see where engineering goes next despite all the stress and whiplash it has caused. However, we are seeing big gaps in culture generally as well as non-engineering teams like marketing, product, and dev experience. We need good, experienced leaders in there ASAP that will be trusted and respected and listened to and seen as equals to the engineering department. We can't keep losing good people because they aren't being supported in doing things outside the limited POV of what is correct according to leadership and outspoken senior developers.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "- There's a lot of potential for things to go super well but any new employee beware that things are really chaotic right now. But if you're looking for a young start-up trying to figure things out, great! Just know that things do NOT feel like a mature start-up (yet) even though there's Series D funding and Sourcegraph has been around for 10 years. - If you're not a more senior engineer (and in some cases Sales), it's hard to make an impact and do good work. Lots of really smart people have left because their expertise was dismissed, especially true of the product, marketing, design, and dev/customer experience teams where we continue to see high turnover. Leadership will continually say that these people have left because of some issue like low performance or culture misfit when really theses super talented people tried many times to make an impact but were stalled at every turn. Not only does it make me distrust leadership it also makes me feel like if I struggle to succeed, it will always be my fault alone and leadership won't do any self-reflection or support me. Case in point, a lot of these recent 5 star reviews seem to be a little fake to me... You can't necessarily trust what they say... And maybe leadership is creating them to cover up more critical problems... - There is favoritism. And the small group making product decisions at this time is a group of senior white men, mostly outspoken developers. If you don't think and communicate in exactly the way that this group does, you won't be listened to at this time and/or will have to put in triple or sometimes even quadruple the effort just to be listened to and trusted. Caveat here is that we've completely changed how we do work in mid-December so need to make some big decisions fast. That means that this isn't necessarily the time to listen to other points of view so we can move fast. But based on my experience working here through multiple pivots in the past year or so, I worry that it will never be a good time to listen to others... And following a strategy of only listening to the loudest in the room who can come up with an idea the fastest isn't always good business. - Leadership constantly changes direction, causing whiplash, and uses the excuse that \"this is a start-up\" to cover up the fact that it really feels like leadership doesn't knows what they're doing. This also affects your work--expect to not do the work listed in the original job posting within a month. - Culture is ambiguous at this time. A lot of people were drawn to the culture originally but, especially with lots of turnover and recent leadership changes, culture is really up in the air with no one committing to maintaining it. I don't necessarily think this is a bad thing per se but just be aware that the culture described in the handbook is not necessarily what it is now. It is in flux and leadership says they are working on it. The handbook itself has been falling behind and is a mix of up to date and out of date content. At this time, it feels like there is no culture besides the people running the show pushing things forward at all costs. This has led to stress, communication struggles, and a few toxic interactions for the entire company to see. If you interview, make sure to ask lots of questions from employees and leadership about culture, impact, expectations, etc. to make sure that it is a good fit for you. - One thing I was excited about was pay transparency and role levelling that came out a few months ago. I felt that was a good first step towards mapping out a career trajectory here at Sourcegraph. With all the changes and the pivots, I feel as if I haven't moved forward in terms of my career goals as I try to keep up with changes every other week. I'm focused more on figuring out how to best support leadership and teammates with the new plan of the week instead of just doing good work. I'm worried that this is having a negative effect on my career growth.",

Layoffs are a common occurrence as well, with several having occurred in the past year- not all of them related to the economy either. Things have been on a downward trajectory, and with the hiring of new senior leadership, we are now headed over a cliff. The culture has done a complete 180 in the past few months. It has gone from great, to ok, to I-don’t-believe-what-I’m-hearing/seeing in record time. Gone are the days where employees felt they could speak up or disagree without being shamed or berated. You can tell that the few remaining leaders are more inclined to just go along with what upper leadership wants, simply out of fear. Attrition is high. Backfills are nil. People leave and their reasoning is different than what senior leadership then tells you. Most of leadership has turned over in the past few months. Do more with less is the prevailing sentiment. People are being required to do things WAY outside their job scope, or else be managed out. There is constant talk of how things work at Amazon or google. Many current employees even left those places to escape the toxic cultures that are now being touted as supreme… and inevitable. Diversity is severely neglected. Senior leadership does not value the opinions but of a few select people, which is clear by public communications. This is has gone from a wonderful people focused company to a truly chaotic at best, and soul crushing at worst, place to work.",

If you work at Sourcegraph, you can bet your days will be full of constant stress and anxiety. One mess up or one exec who doesn't like you means you'll be booted soon enough. Recruiters will sell you on what an awesome place Sourcegraph is. They don't have first hand experience of the day to day operations and they don't know the internal dynamics that exist in the company. They're totally out of touch and will just sell you on the high base salary and cool perks. Don't be fooled.",

If I had something important to discuss with my manager and a zoom was more appropriate, sometimes my manager would insist I send a slack. My manager would then take time to critique my slack message with suggestions on how I could shorten it in the future. \r\n\r\n* Half-hearted attempt at diversity: There is a real desire to foster DEI as part of the culture, but I never felt like it was really executed on while I was there. There were things they did well (hiring across the world &amp; pay equity) but also lot of areas where it fell short.\r\n\r\n Examples of how it fell short: Very clique-ish culture. A primarily white/male dominated environment when I was there, in particular, most of the managers and leaders were white and/or male. Their recruiting team is not diverse, which is odd to me if you're making a push to hire for diversity. There was no official DEI group or any ERGs to create community. There was no pay transparency between departments and roles. \r\n\r\n* Leadership is inexperienced and communication from them could be better Leaders, as individuals, were some of the most talented people i've ever met, but in leadership roles they couldn't seem to make a cohesive decision or if they did, it felt like they made it too late...always felt like we were a little behind the curve. \r\n\r\nExample: Leaders tried really hard to differentiate themselves from Github through numerous pivots and tangential ideas but never seemed to quite pull it off. I'm not surprised they have now chosen the *brilliant* idea to pivot into the ai coding assistant space, once again putting it in a struggle against Github's robust and impressively developed Copilot. \r\n\r\nA lot of these pivots were made to try to gain traction somewhere, anywhere, and in my opinion is partially due to a disconnect between product and engineering. It seemed like the PMs had constant uphill battles leading to a revolving door of PMs coming and going. This is also evident with the marketing department. While I was there it felt like those departments were never set up for success.",

There has been a lot of change this year. Partially due to the downturn and partially due to a change in leadership. Large scale changes are always hard and when it is coupled with the worst economic environment in over a decade, things have been tough but improving. The leadership changes were a must and I feel like we've really 'up-leveled' the exec team (as our CEO has said) and think we have better people in place to lead us across Eng, Product, Sales, and People. The leadership team is also young / new to positions of power / authority and and have made some big mistakes.

That's the thing that matters most, because it makes up for a lot of pain associated with growing and scaling. Due to a combination of crazy tech funding over the last 2 - 3 years and our leadership's ability to assembling one of the most impressive boards (a16z, Sequoia, Craft, Redpoint, and a few others), we secured 125M+ in Series D funding. As a result, we have incredibly high cash reserves that allows us to stay focused on building for the long-term and not having to make short-sighted decisions just to stay alive in the short-term. We are still investing in our business, we are still growing in areas that show strong returns, and I feel like if / when you can prove out an MVP you can and will get support from leadership in the form of budget and head count. We have still faced our own cuts (more on that below), but where there is momentum there is support. We are transparent. Probably to a fault. I honestly find it a little scary that I know everything about our business. All of our finances, our spending, our revenue growth is publicly available for anyone and everyone at the company. Not only that, our head of finance / ops regularly talks about our head count plans, what our forecasting numbers will look like and what will happen if we don't meet targets. I genuinely love working with most of the people at this company. Lots of eager, smart, and genuinely customer-oriented people that just want to make our customers happy. Comp is pretty great. Our handbook has a stated goal to pay everyone at 75% of their job band so we pay, by definition, above market (this isn't always clean but I rarely hear anyone complain about their compensation). This also comes with high expectations that we hire great talent and pay for it. There is pressure there that isn't for everyone.",

The team across the board is full of self-starters who aren't afraid to share their ideas, and the lack of red tape means things get done quickly. Even though the past year has been insanely tough for mostly everyone in tech (and the exec team undoubtedly had to make some extremely hard decisions that they told us about with as much transparency as possible at every step), I have no doubt that Sourcegraph is going to come out on top. I've personally learned and grown more here than anywhere else I've worked before, and I couldn't be happier.

ERG groups were told to not meet on company time or use company resources. - Favoritism abounds. The people who worked 70+ hour weeks are who were praised, awarded, saved from layoffs.

With the company at a crucial stage, your time and expertise could be more impactful in addressing strategic issues and steering the company towards success.\n\nFor the CTO: The key to great software development lies in a strong, well-supported team. Reflecting on the consistent feedback in these reviews could be enlightening. This introspection may help fine-tune your leadership approach, enhancing team dynamics and contributing positively to Sourcegraph’s trajectory.\n\nTo the ever-evolving leadership team at Sourcegraph: As you navigate your new roles, be mindful that job security has been a recurring challenge within the company. It's crucial not to take any outcomes personally. Numerous highly skilled predecessors have faced similar situations. Stay positive but honest, give it your best, and remember that the outcome is more about the company's ongoing dynamics than a measure of your individual talents.

It's always good to go in with both eyes open, right?\n\nThe work environment at Sourcegraph isn't just a mixed bag; it presents considerable challenges. They've made a strategic pivot recently, but that's only part of the story. The leadership team has been completely overhauled multiple times in just two years. It's tough to have any confidence in the longevity of the current leadership when you've seen their predecessors shown the door one after the other. Initially, these changes brought a sense of hope, but by the third round, it's hard not to feel a bit sorry for the new leaders who are trying their best - just like the last ones did.\n\nRegarding the executive team, to put it simply, they lack experience. There's a palpable sense of internal strife, almost like they're participants in their own version of the Hunger Games, each afraid of being the next to go. This atmosphere of uncertainty doesn't lead to outright micromanagement, but something perhaps more frustrating. Often, you'll receive vague directives like \"make it better\" without clear guidance on what that actually means. If you dare to ask for clarification, you risk being labeled as entitled. And remember, how you interpret and act on these vague instructions will come back around in your impact reviews, which I'll get into a bit more later.\n\nJob security is a significant concern. Layoffs have become a recurring theme, not just an occasional blip. It's happened several times over the last two years alone. With the management structure in constant flux, you never really feel settled. It's like standing on shifting sands, always unsure of where you stand or who you'll report to next or if they will even be left around by the next review cycle.\n\nNow, let's talk about the impact reviews. Sourcegraph has been around for a decade, so they're far from a startup. The real issue is that they're struggling to find a way to significantly increase revenue to finally IPO. The CEO and CTO seem to be out of fresh ideas, so there's this pressure on employees to come up with million-dollar ideas - or to “make it better” 😉. If you don't come up with something that substantially boosts the bottom line, you're labeled as not making an impact, putting you at risk of being in the next round of layoffs which always seem to be just around the corner. Even if you do come up with a great idea, it gets absorbed by the top brass, and then it's back to square one - you need another big idea, increase your commit rate (which gets judged at impact reviews) or go back to helping endless new hires, new management, and customer success team navigate a tech stack that's been left hollow by the departure of the many skilled devs that owned them but have left due to layoffs or attrition and hope that they perceive those efforts as impactful.\n\nIn short, while there are some perks like fair pay, the overall environment is fraught with peril, from unstable leadership and job insecurity to a high-pressure culture around million dollar feature ideas. It's a lot to take on, and I just wanted you to know what you might be getting into.\n\nWishing you the best in your job search and career. Take care!",

          "cons": "Sourcegraph, a decade old company, has regressed to pre-product market fit after a recent strategic and product pivot. The new flagship product lacks significant differentiated from an equivalent Microsoft product with greater distribution and comparatively infinite runway.\n\nThe majority (if not all) of the exec team is working in their largest role, and those making decisions have very little experience working in teams they do not control with absolute power. Execs have opposing goals for the company and have continuously failed to build a team that they can or are willing to place their trust in. They will micromanage down to the IC level, and spend focus on controlling things like \"woke DEI culture\" at the expense of addressing key business challenges.\n\nCommunication is majorly problematic. PeopleOps and Communications teams find themselves frequently deleting or damage-controlling messages from executives. These messages undermine morale (sometimes punching-down to particular ICs) and create unnecessary panic, sometimes involving self-aggrandizing narratives against the board. The phrase \"Psychological safety was a zero-interest rate phenomenon\" became emblematic of the company culture, especially following the first round of layoffs.\n\nThese layoffs have been a recurring theme, with at least four separate instances over the past year alone. The engineering leadership's contradictory characterizations of the individual contributors (ICs) as simultaneously 'entitled', 'under-performing', 'mis-skilled', yet 'world-class' reflect a deep-seated misalignment. This misalignment is further exacerbated by the leadership's demand for unquestioned adherence to an opaque strategy, where any attempt at seeking clarity is viewed as dissent.\n\nThe organizational structure has seen dramatic shifts. Initially, a layer of engineering directors was removed for their slow decision-making in an environment of impossible contradictory goals. More recently, a wave of new directors and department heads, predominantly from Google, were brought in, treating this Series D startup as if it operated with the culture and resources of a FAANG company. Despite these extensive changes, tangible improvements in engineering or product development haven't seemed to develop.\n\nCompounding these challenges is the absence of managers focused primarily on people management within the engineering organization. Every manager is also an individual contributor, creating a situation where managers are overburdened with dual responsibilities. This has led to a rapid turnover in management roles, with several individual contributors taking on managerial positions and reverting within a year, leaving a few with disproportionately large teams to manage.\n\nRecent calibration was particularly brutal. There is a recurring pattern of shifting goal posts and large pivots coming from left-field, and at impact review time everyone's previous quarter worth of work is judged on the vibes-du-jour instead of the goals that were set when action taking place. You can be set a goal by a one exec, then at calibration time be punished for achieving this goal by a different exec who retroactively disagrees with the goal (or was unaware of the goal, or disagreed but kept feedback to themselves until it grew to resentment).",

Things have been on a downward trajectory, and with the hiring of new senior leadership, we are now headed over a cliff. The culture has done a complete 180 in the past few months. It has gone from great, to ok, to I-don’t-believe-what-I’m-hearing/seeing in record time. Gone are the days where employees felt they could speak up or disagree without being shamed or berated. You can tell that the few remaining leaders are more inclined to just go along with what upper leadership wants, simply out of fear. Attrition is high. Backfills are nil. People leave and their reasoning is different than what senior leadership then tells you. Most of leadership has turned over in the past few months. Do more with less is the prevailing sentiment. People are being required to do things WAY outside their job scope, or else be managed out. There is constant talk of how things work at Amazon or google. Many current employees even left those places to escape the toxic cultures that are now being touted as supreme… and inevitable. Diversity is severely neglected. Senior leadership does not value the opinions but of a few select people, which is clear by public communications.

There has been a lot of change this year. Partially due to the downturn and partially due to a change in leadership. Large scale changes are always hard and when it is coupled with the worst economic environment in over a decade, things have been tough but improving. The leadership changes were a must and I feel like we've really 'up-leveled' the exec team (as our CEO has said) and think we have better people in place to lead us across Eng, Product, Sales, and People.

As a result, we have incredibly high cash reserves that allows us to stay focused on building for the long-term and not having to make short-sighted decisions just to stay alive in the short-term. We are still investing in our business, we are still growing in areas that show strong returns, and I feel like if / when you can prove out an MVP you can and will get support from leadership in the form of budget and head count. We have still faced our own cuts (more on that below), but where there is momentum there is support. We are transparent. Probably to a fault. I honestly find it a little scary that I know everything about our business. All of our finances, our spending, our revenue growth is publicly available for anyone and everyone at the company. Not only that, our head of finance / ops regularly talks about our head count plans, what our forecasting numbers will look like and what will happen if we don't meet targets. I genuinely love working with most of the people at this company. Lots of eager, smart, and genuinely customer-oriented people that just want to make our customers happy. Comp is pretty great. Our handbook has a stated goal to pay everyone at 75% of their job band so we pay, by definition, above market (this isn't always clean but I rarely hear anyone complain about their compensation).

We need good, experienced leaders in there ASAP that will be trusted and respected and listened to and seen as equals to the engineering department. We can't keep losing good people because they aren't being supported in doing things outside the limited POV of what is correct according to leadership and outspoken senior developers.",
        "cons": "- There's a lot of potential for things to go super well but any new employee beware that things are really chaotic right now. But if you're looking for a young start-up trying to figure things out, great! Just know that things do NOT feel like a mature start-up (yet) even though there's Series D funding and Sourcegraph has been around for 10 years. - If you're not a more senior engineer (and in some cases Sales), it's hard to make an impact and do good work. Lots of really smart people have left because their expertise was dismissed, especially true of the product, marketing, design, and dev/customer experience teams where we continue to see high turnover. Leadership will continually say that these people have left because of some issue like low performance or culture misfit when really theses super talented people tried many times to make an impact but were stalled at every turn. Not only does it make me distrust leadership it also makes me feel like if I struggle to succeed, it will always be my fault alone and leadership won't do any self-reflection or support me. Case in point, a lot of these recent 5 star reviews seem to be a little fake to me... You can't necessarily trust what they say... And maybe leadership is creating them to cover up more critical problems... - There is favoritism. And the small group making product decisions at this time is a group of senior white men, mostly outspoken developers. If you don't think and communicate in exactly the way that this group does, you won't be listened to at this time and/or will have to put in triple or sometimes even quadruple the effort just to be listened to and trusted. Caveat here is that we've completely changed how we do work in mid-December so need to make some big decisions fast. That means that this isn't necessarily the time to listen to other points of view so we can move fast. But based on my experience working here through multiple pivots in the past year or so, I worry that it will never be a good time to listen to others... And following a strategy of only listening to the loudest in the room who can come up with an idea the fastest isn't always good business. - Leadership constantly changes direction, causing whiplash, and uses the excuse that \"this is a start-up\" to cover up the fact that it really feels like leadership doesn't knows what they're doing. This also affects your work--expect to not do the work listed in the original job posting within a month. - Culture is ambiguous at this time. A lot of people were drawn to the culture originally but, especially with lots of turnover and recent leadership changes, culture is really up in the air with no one committing to maintaining it. I don't necessarily think this is a bad thing per se but just be aware that the culture described in the handbook is not necessarily what it is now. It is in flux and leadership says they are working on it. The handbook itself has been falling behind and is a mix of up to date and out of date content. At this time, it feels like there is no culture besides the people running the show pushing things forward at all costs. This has led to stress, communication struggles, and a few toxic interactions for the entire company to see. If you interview, make sure to ask lots of questions from employees and leadership about culture, impact, expectations, etc. to make sure that it is a good fit for you. - One thing I was excited about was pay transparency and role levelling that came out a few months ago. I felt that was a good first step towards mapping out a career trajectory here at Sourcegraph. With all the changes and the pivots, I feel as if I haven't moved forward in terms of my career goals as I try to keep up with changes every other week. I'm focused more on figuring out how to best support leadership and teammates with the new plan of the week instead of just doing good work. I'm worried that this is having a negative effect on my career growth.",

SteveY only cares about the technical side of things but seems to be calling all the shots. Take a serious look in the mirror - did recent opt-out opportunities actually move Sourcegraph toward the culture you want to create? Do you even know what that culture is? Why were opt-outs in prod/engineering disproportionately female relative to the rest of prod/engineering? Define the culture you actual want, and why, and make decisions accordingly. The company is far too directionless, which is a real shame because the product is awesome. Who are you? Who do you want to be? How will you get there?

Obviously the recent spike in reviews tells you company culture change is happening and acknowledged internally - how will you position that to candidates?",
        "cons": "Sourcegraph is making a conscious effort to change it's culture by encouraging people to be \"scrappy,\" operate in ambiguity, and by discouraging \"Entitlement\" to information about company direction, and the \"why\" behind decisions. Within this change in culture, there exists great opportunity for individuals who are looking for opportunities to make big impact and advance quickly in their careers by taking on a ton of responsibility. This is a founder-led organization, where the founders expect everyone to give as much time and effort possible to Sourcegraph - they are understandably completely invested in the product and expect the same of Teammates. You will be expected to embrace The Grind of start up life.. You will feel like you have to be responsive at all times because \"asynchronous\" culture results in a lot of evening, weekend, and holiday work (BTW many roles are pulled into tons of meetings). It's important to understand what \"be flexible\" means in the context of a lot of these reviews - be ready for quick changes in direction, because there is a serious lack of commitment to long-term plans. The 30 day minimum PTO requirement is great, in theory, but not enforced or monitored in any way. Lastly, despite being a high performer (and rewarded as such), I felt this was a place where the consequences of making a mistake were high, particularly when interacting with senior leadership. I witnessed individuals very abruptly go from being valued contributors to sidelined. Most top performers do not have families, and those who do have a partner that does care taking. Ask questions during the interview process about what's important to you - you will get straightforward answers from most hiring managers. Know that \"scrappy\" is code for working a lot, \"high performance culture\" means taking direction well, and being \"flexible\" equates to frequently changing direction or doing things very last-minute based on arbitrary deadlines.",

There is a huge opportunity here for people willing to devote a ton of their lives to work - and leadership is making intentional steps to foster that environment. The handbook is awesome, and internal processes are documented well, although it can be information overload. The company uses Slack heavily (a pro, in my book, provided you are comfortable with wading through large amounts of information and being tagged in tons of CYA-type posts). I did not appreciate the culture shift that happened after I joined, where leadership doesn't care about people who were good at their jobs choosing to leave, so I left quickly myself. I'm great at what I do and therefore do not need to work for a company that doesn't value good management, promotes competition between team members, and doesn't respect work/life boundaries.

If I had something important to discuss with my manager and a zoom was more appropriate, sometimes my manager would insist I send a slack. My manager would then take time to critique my slack message with suggestions on how I could shorten it in the future. \r\n\r\n* Half-hearted attempt at diversity: There is a real desire to foster DEI as part of the culture, but I never felt like it was really executed on while I was there. There were things they did well (hiring across the world &amp; pay equity) but also lot of areas where it fell short.\r\n\r\n Examples of how it fell short: Very clique-ish culture. A primarily white/male dominated environment when I was there, in particular, most of the managers and leaders were white and/or male. Their recruiting team is not diverse, which is odd to me if you're making a push to hire for diversity. There was no official DEI group or any ERGs to create community. There was no pay transparency between departments and roles. \r\n\r\n* Leadership is inexperienced and communication from them could be better Leaders, as individuals, were some of the most talented people i've ever met, but in leadership roles they couldn't seem to make a cohesive decision or if they did, it felt like they made it too late...always felt like we were a little behind the curve. \r\n\r\nExample: Leaders tried really hard to differentiate themselves from Github through numerous pivots and tangential ideas but never seemed to quite pull it off. I'm not surprised they have now chosen the *brilliant* idea to pivot into the ai coding assistant space, once again putting it in a struggle against Github's robust and impressively developed Copilot. \r\n\r\nA lot of these pivots were made to try to gain traction somewhere, anywhere, and in my opinion is partially due to a disconnect between product and engineering. It seemed like the PMs had constant uphill battles leading to a revolving door of PMs coming and going. This is also evident with the marketing department.

        "cons": "Sourcegraph, a decade old company, has regressed to pre-product market fit after a recent strategic and product pivot. The new flagship product lacks significant differentiated from an equivalent Microsoft product with greater distribution and comparatively infinite runway.\n\nThe majority (if not all) of the exec team is working in their largest role, and those making decisions have very little experience working in teams they do not control with absolute power. Execs have opposing goals for the company and have continuously failed to build a team that they can or are willing to place their trust in. They will micromanage down to the IC level, and spend focus on controlling things like \"woke DEI culture\" at the expense of addressing key business challenges.\n\nCommunication is majorly problematic. PeopleOps and Communications teams find themselves frequently deleting or damage-controlling messages from executives. These messages undermine morale (sometimes punching-down to particular ICs) and create unnecessary panic, sometimes involving self-aggrandizing narratives against the board. The phrase \"Psychological safety was a zero-interest rate phenomenon\" became emblematic of the company culture, especially following the first round of layoffs.\n\nThese layoffs have been a recurring theme, with at least four separate instances over the past year alone. The engineering leadership's contradictory characterizations of the individual contributors (ICs) as simultaneously 'entitled', 'under-performing', 'mis-skilled', yet 'world-class' reflect a deep-seated misalignment. This misalignment is further exacerbated by the leadership's demand for unquestioned adherence to an opaque strategy, where any attempt at seeking clarity is viewed as dissent.\n\nThe organizational structure has seen dramatic shifts. Initially, a layer of engineering directors was removed for their slow decision-making in an environment of impossible contradictory goals. More recently, a wave of new directors and department heads, predominantly from Google, were brought in, treating this Series D startup as if it operated with the culture and resources of a FAANG company. Despite these extensive changes, tangible improvements in engineering or product development haven't seemed to develop.\n\nCompounding these challenges is the absence of managers focused primarily on people management within the engineering organization. Every manager is also an individual contributor, creating a situation where managers are overburdened with dual responsibilities. This has led to a rapid turnover in management roles, with several individual contributors taking on managerial positions and reverting within a year, leaving a few with disproportionately large teams to manage.\n\nRecent calibration was particularly brutal. There is a recurring pattern of shifting goal posts and large pivots coming from left-field, and at impact review time everyone's previous quarter worth of work is judged on the vibes-du-jour instead of the goals that were set when action taking place. You can be set a goal by a one exec, then at calibration time be punished for achieving this goal by a different exec who retroactively disagrees with the goal (or was unaware of the goal, or disagreed but kept feedback to themselves until it grew to resentment).",

The culture around impact reviews tends to undermine the practicality of the unlimited PTO policy. Additionally, while the new executive's awareness of cultural issues is a positive step, the depth and complexity of these problems make significant improvements challenging.",

With the company at a crucial stage, your time and expertise could be more impactful in addressing strategic issues and steering the company towards success.\n\nFor the CTO: The key to great software development lies in a strong, well-supported team. Reflecting on the consistent feedback in these reviews could be enlightening. This introspection may help fine-tune your leadership approach, enhancing team dynamics and contributing positively to Sourcegraph’s trajectory.\n\nTo the ever-evolving leadership team at Sourcegraph: As you navigate your new roles, be mindful that job security has been a recurring challenge within the company. It's crucial not to take any outcomes personally. Numerous highly skilled predecessors have faced similar situations. Stay positive but honest, give it your best, and remember that the outcome is more about the company's ongoing dynamics than a measure of your individual talents.

        "cons": "I wanted to share some real talk about my time at Sourcegraph, especially since you might be considering a role there. It's always good to go in with both eyes open, right?\n\nThe work environment at Sourcegraph isn't just a mixed bag; it presents considerable challenges. They've made a strategic pivot recently, but that's only part of the story. The leadership team has been completely overhauled multiple times in just two years. It's tough to have any confidence in the longevity of the current leadership when you've seen their predecessors shown the door one after the other. Initially, these changes brought a sense of hope, but by the third round, it's hard not to feel a bit sorry for the new leaders who are trying their best - just like the last ones did.\n\nRegarding the executive team, to put it simply, they lack experience. There's a palpable sense of internal strife, almost like they're participants in their own version of the Hunger Games, each afraid of being the next to go. This atmosphere of uncertainty doesn't lead to outright micromanagement, but something perhaps more frustrating. Often, you'll receive vague directives like \"make it better\" without clear guidance on what that actually means. If you dare to ask for clarification, you risk being labeled as entitled. And remember, how you interpret and act on these vague instructions will come back around in your impact reviews, which I'll get into a bit more later.\n\nJob security is a significant concern. Layoffs have become a recurring theme, not just an occasional blip. It's happened several times over the last two years alone. With the management structure in constant flux, you never really feel settled. It's like standing on shifting sands, always unsure of where you stand or who you'll report to next or if they will even be left around by the next review cycle.\n\nNow, let's talk about the impact reviews. Sourcegraph has been around for a decade, so they're far from a startup. The real issue is that they're struggling to find a way to significantly increase revenue to finally IPO. The CEO and CTO seem to be out of fresh ideas, so there's this pressure on employees to come up with million-dollar ideas - or to “make it better” 😉. If you don't come up with something that substantially boosts the bottom line, you're labeled as not making an impact, putting you at risk of being in the next round of layoffs which always seem to be just around the corner. Even if you do come up with a great idea, it gets absorbed by the top brass, and then it's back to square one - you need another big idea, increase your commit rate (which gets judged at impact reviews) or go back to helping endless new hires, new management, and customer success team navigate a tech stack that's been left hollow by the departure of the many skilled devs that owned them but have left due to layoffs or attrition and hope that they perceive those efforts as impactful.\n\nIn short, while there are some perks like fair pay, the overall environment is fraught with peril, from unstable leadership and job insecurity to a high-pressure culture around million dollar feature ideas. It's a lot to take on, and I just wanted you to know what you might be getting into.\n\nWishing you the best in your job search and career. Take care!",

        "cons": "There was a big layoff in mid 2022, and since then, this place has been on a rapid decline. DEI was done away with quickly, and benefits began getting pulled left and right. Since then, there has been no sense of safety or longevity. You clock in each day with the idea that it could be your last.\n\nThe smartest leaders were shown the door, and the ones that kept their jobs were the loyalists to the exec suite's ideas, no matter how weak or deranged. The exec suite thought it was a good idea to change what we sold and for how much every few months, then berated teams for not hitting quota (which was next to impossible when there was no direction). \n\nThis environment quickly spiraled in to the Hunger Games. Exec meetings became tense and the ICs felt the trickle down as managers threw their own people under the bus. The calibration cycle almost a year ago was incredibly brutal, built solely on an agenda to make as many top performers quit as possible to save some cash. \n\nWhat used to make this place worthwhile (location-agnostic pay, work-life balance) doesn't exist anymore. Instead, you'll join a company that gets off on backstabbing, steamrolling, and punishment. The bad managers do nothing but gaslight and indulge in toxicity with their direct reports. They play favorites and if you're not in the \"in\" club, you'll be shown the pink slip soon enough. The ones that \"succeed\" here are the \"yes\" men (and yes, it is mostly men since DEI isn't a priority anymore) and the ones that are willing to put their health, mental state, and/or personal life on the line in order to get ahead for a company that will quickly lose the AI race to any number of stronger giants. Working late nights and weekends is the rule, not the exception, but they'll lead with their \"work from anywhere\" culture in interviews to make it seem reasonable. \n\nIt does not matter if you've been successful at Sourcegraph or have hit your goals consistently quarter after quarter. If they decide that they don't like you, you'll be gaslit, punished, and eventually pushed to leave.\n\nThey hire some of the smartest people that I've ever met, but they abuse them to the point that the best friends I made at Sourcegraph were due to trauma bonding together.",

        "pros": "This place used to be a great place to work only a couple years ago. Promotions and raises came quickly, contributions were celebrated and amplified, and the benefits were unmatched.

      "# [Revenge of the junior developer](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/revenge-of-the-junior-developer)\nHello, hello, hello! Good to see everyone again.\n\nI've really gotta start being careful what I say these days. I've got so many people watching.\n\nSo anyway, I ripped a fart the other day that sounded like viiiibecooode, and I was immediately approached by 3 investors. I had to tell them no sorry that was just a fart, just to get them off me.\n\nThere's so much going on that once again I tried several times to write this post, but each attempt grew huge and rabid, and I had to put 'em all down like Old Yeller. This time I'll just ship it while it's still a pup. (Edit: Damn. At least it’s action-packed to the end.)\n\nBrief note about the meaning of \"vibe coding\": In this post, I assume that vibe coding will grow up and people will use it for real engineering, with the \"turn your brain off\" version of it sticking around just for prototyping and fun projects. For me, vibe coding just means letting the AI do the work. How closely you choose to pay attention to the AI's work depends solely on the problem at hand. For production, you pay attention; for prototypes, you chill. Either way, it’s vibe coding if you didn’t write it by hand.\n\nOne more note: The revenge part happens at the very end, just like in the movies.\n\nOK! With those administrative items out of the way, let's goooooo!\n\n‍\n\nPart 1: The six waves\n\nVibe coding is a whimsical name for chat-based coding, where you ask the LLM to write code, and then you feed it the results and ask it for more, in a continuous loop. It’s very different from traditional coding, or even coding with code completions.\n\nChat coding has been around a while in coding assistants, but without a rallying cry. It finally got one, when in early February the illustrious Dr. Andrej Karpathy, famed among other things for co-founding OpenAI, put a pretty name to the face of chat. He called it “vibe coding” and it became an instant blue/gold dress situation pretty much overnight.\n\nToday as of, wait lemme look at my watch, right now as you’re reading this, vibe coding has entered a strange, unprecedented, quantum-like triplet-state:\n\nVibe coding is still completely invisible to 80% of the industry outside Silicon Valley, who will have little clue as to what we’re talking about here. Many haven’t even heard the phrase “vibe coding” yet, let alone “coding agent”. I guess they never open the news? Unfortunately they all risk getting blindsided, nay, T-boned by AI.\n\nVibe coding is currently going batshit viral, growing like crazy on a dramatic exponential curve, hitting major media outlets like the NYT, flooding social media, celebrated by some, decried by others. A bunch of companies were busy banishing it just as Google was unofficially adopting it. Everyone’s still arguing about what “vibe coding” even means. But a ton of people, more every day, think it’s the future right now.\n\nChat coding in general is already utterly passé to an exponentially-faster growing group of developers who now wouldn’t walk across the street to piss on chat-based coding if it was on fire. They are still vibe coding and indeed getting better vibes than anyone. And yet they could not possibly care any less about your vibe coding – those long back-and-forth chat conversations – ever again, good day to you Sir, I said Good. Day!\n\nHere at Exaggeration Central, we are finding it hard to make anything up that’s crazier than this. It’s real, but unfolding so fast that it feels genuinely surreal.\n\nVibe coding is in steep ascent, and chat-based coding – what you think of as vibe coding, and what I used to call CHOP – is indeed also still on the rise… for now. But agentic coding – the subject of this post – will soon rocket by chat coding as if it’s standing still.\n\nBy Q3, today's chat coding will for many have become a dire fallback of last resort, reserved for when you can’t afford to do it the superfast way with agents. And through it all, as chat coding is eclipsed, vibe coding will live on.\n\nI've done my best to represent how I personally think about this stuff in Figure 1.\n\n‍\n\nThe chart in Figure 1 depicts six overlapping waves of programming: traditional (2022), completions-based (2023), chat-based (2024), coding agents (2025 H1), agent clusters (2025 H2), and agent fleets (2026).\n\nIn the figure, traditional and completions-based coding – the two manual modalities – are on the decline, and the others are rising exponentially. Beginning with chat, each new wave rises much faster than previous waves. Finally the figure depicts vibe coding as also increasing exponentially, but on a dotted line alongside the others, because as we’ll see in a bit, vibe coding is not a modality.\n\nAs a sneak preview for our discussion, \"agent clusters\" is the placeholder term I'm using for devs being able to run and fruitfully manage many coding agents in parallel, potentially even more than can fit on a dev’s local machine. And \"agent fleets\" are what happens when we get AI supervisors for the leaf nodes, as shown in Figure 2, \"FY26 Org Chart\".\n\n‍\n\nThis figure shows all individual contributor (leaf-node) devs in the org acting like second-level line managers, running AI “manager agents,” which themselves are supervising groups of coding agents. For instance, under the guidance of a single IC developer, one managed agent group might be doing bug backlog grooming, another working on new business features, and a third group working on a long-running architectural migration. A veritable agent farm!\n\nThis is of course just a crude approximation of how it will unfold, but I think it's close enough. We all predicted the “wave four” coding agents were coming, and they arrived faster than most of us expected. And it's already possible to jump on wave five manually, albeit with effort. I’ve been running two agents in parallel. When you do this, it becomes evident that a lot of the work can be facilitated with agentic help.\n\nHow do agents help with agents? Today, you have to notice when an agent worker is stuck, spinning, or done, and nudge it appropriately. Supervisor agents can and will start doing most of that for us very soon. The result: wave six. Developers will be empowered to keep work queues full in large fleets of coding agents, grinding their way through vast mountain ranges of enterprise legacy code. It will be glorious.\n\nAnd these magical agent fleets will be here by early 2026 at the latest. Because building them isn't actually that hard – we're already very good at parallelizing work.\n\nThat’s our lightning intro. Lots more to come. If all this is a big fat surprise to you, then you're in for some troubled waters in the months ahead.\n\n‍\n\nPart 2: Where are you?\n\nIf you still think of AI-based code-autocompletion suggestions as the primary way programmers use AI, and/or you are still measuring Completion Acceptance Rate (CAR), then you are sitting on the vaguely dinosaur-shaped curve representing Traditional Programming in Figure 1. This curve super-slides into obsolescence around 2027.\n\nI have bad news: Code completions were very popular a year ago, a time that now feels like a distant prequel. But they are now the AI equivalent of “dead man walking.”\n\nIf you’re a bit more avant-garde, then you might think that chat-based programming is how things are going to unfold this year – meaning, in-IDE coding assistant chat interfaces like Copilot, Cursor, Sourcegraph, and Windsurf. If you’re in this group, then you're not doing too badly at all. Middle-of-the-pack, pat on the back. You've at least adopted a modality that's useful – extremely so compared to code completions – and chat is still rising in popularity.\n\nBut suddenly we have this latest wave, the new coding agents like Aider.chat and Claude Code – and soon, similar and prettier agents in all your favorite IDEs, wink nudge cough cough.\n\nOnce you have tried coding agents, and figured out how to be effective with them, you will never want to go back. They are going to stomp chat coding. And the great thing is, with agents you are still vibe coding. That’s why it’s not a modality: You can vibe code with any non-manual AI modality: chat, agents, clusters. As long as AI is doing the work, you’re vibing! The only difference with agents is that you don’t rendezvous with them as often.\n\nNow that agents have emerged, we can start to see patterns. Each successive modality wave, beginning with chat, is conservatively about 5x as productive as the previous wave. Chat can be 5x as productive as manual coding, agents can be 5x as productive as chat, and so on. Note that each wave would probably grow to be 10x as productive as its predecessor, if left unchallenged and given time to mature. But they keep getting flattened by new, even faster modalities.\n\nThat’s the situation as I see it today. We find ourselves in a big race in the AI ocean, beslapped by increasingly violent waves. The ones who make it will ride those waves. Every company falls somewhere on one or more of the adoption curves in Figure 1. Where are you?\n\nAnd that, dear folks, is my charming, Disneyfied mental model of what lies ahead. I’ve asserted that the upcoming waves of clusters and fleets are not only inevitable, but practically right around the corner. Vibe coding remains a durable and lasting feature of that landscape – but not in the way most people think. Vibe coding simply means never writing code again.\n\nIf you're with me so far, then let’s take a look at the financial impacts. First I’ll quickly get you up to speed on how coding agents work – it’s not complicated, you just start burning money and the smoke makes them smarter. And if you’re not with me so far, I encourage you to go play with these new coding agents. Seriously. Or watch someone who knows how.\n\nWhether you're convinced or skeptical, let’s at least look at how these new coding agents actually work. Because there’s no magic.\n\n‍\n\nPart 3: New camel owner’s manual\n\nLet's examine how these new coding agents work, to help you see why this mere weeks-old development could quickly put your company in a real bind. A right pickle, you might say. A fine kettle of fish.\n\nWe’ve heard claims of software coding agents before. But this is different. These “true” coding agents are still very very new, weeks old at best, and they only run in text-based 1970s Unix-style terminals. Getting one of these is a lot like you've been walking all your life and someone gives you a free camel. In fact, they say, take all the damn camels you want. And it’s amazing having one. One. They're great compared to walking everywhere, but they'll spit on you and bite you and they require large amounts of leafy green food, primarily fifties and hundreds.\n\nA lot of you, I know this for a fact, have been super skeptical about chat coding. I’ve even heard that some developers have expressed to their managers, clearly and unambiguously, that they want to keep writing code. That’s what they’re here for, they say. Writing. Code. They say it slowly, like they think you’re deaf and it would help. They claim they’re never going to delegate their coding work to an AI. Hey there! I see you.\n\nAll of you skeptics should drop whatever you’re doing or holding, just throw it on the ground, and run like mad towards the nearest camel and hop on. Download and try out a coding agent, ideally one launched after March 1st 2025. Because they turn whatever you know or thought you knew about coding with AI, right on its head. I myself could scarcely believe what I was seeing, just three weeks ago.\n\nCoding agents are simple enough in principle. They work just like a typical vibe-coding chat session, with the LLM doing most of the analysis and heavy lifting, and you mostly wearing headphones. But with agents, you don’t have to do all the ugly toil of bidirectional copy/paste and associated prompting, which is the slow human-y part. Instead, the agent takes over and handles that for you, only returning to chat with you when it finishes or gets stuck or you run out of cash.\n\nAnd they often get pretty darn far, entirely unassisted. They just grind away at their task until they get it right, throwing tokens at the problem to explore the space as needed. The human is removed as the bottleneck for 90-99% of the work, but otherwise it’s pretty much just like a faster version of chat vibe coding.\n\nThe only practical difference from chat, aside from cost, is that agents can perform much larger subtasks at a time, potentially encompassing many individual steps. During this time, the supervising developer is freed up for important work like finishing off that bag of Cheetos and browsing HN. Whereas if you try to do that in a chat session, your keyboard becomes encrusted with Cheeto-slime, or so I am informed by some fairly credible sources.\n\nJust to make it concrete, you might tell a coding agent something like, \"Here is JIRA ticket #<number>; please go fix it.\" That is all you would need to say. The agent would first try hard to get access to the JIRA ticket: it might look for the JIRA command-line tool, maybe even asking you if it can download it. It could even write a throwaway program for itself to fetch the ticket fields programmatically. We see them write throwaway programs pretty often.\n\nOnce the agent can read the ticket, it uses tools on your machine, examining your code just like you would, to track your bug down. It asks you for permissions for each tool – one of the biggest slowdowns in the process today. Once the agent finds the bug, it will propose a fix, write tests to verify the fix, run those tests, and make any other changes necessary to get the tests passing – all in a loop without needing you, for the most part.\n\nThese new coding agents can solve huge issues, create even bigger messes, and generally behave like a supernaturally fast human developer who’s always flying a little blind and a little behind schedule.\n\nIt sounds like science fiction but you can use them right now.\n\nIt's important to understand that these new agents are still only capable of handling modestly small-ish to medium-esque tasks at a time. Task graph decomposition, a skill we've all learned during the chat days of yore (December), is just as important today as you switch to vibe coding with agents. Even more so, because it’s so easy to overshoot and be over-ambitious with agents. They are so incredibly effective that it’s easy to get greedy and smother the goose.\n\nAs fast and robust as they may be, you still need to break things down and shepherd coding agents carefully. If you give one a task that’s too big, like \"Please fix all my JIRA tickets\", it will hurl itself at the problem and get almost nowhere. They require careful supervision and thoughtful problem selection today. In short, they are ornery critters.\n\nBut that will change. Before you can so much as lash a bat, speaking of critters, agents will creep into your IDE, not as camels but as saddled horses: a mostly ergonomic improvement, sure, but a welcome one. It will be nice to have a tool that can’t spit foul-smelling fluids with high accuracy at objects up to thirty-six meters away.\n\nEvery iteration of the tools from here on out will help make coding agents easier, more parallelizable, and more powerful. And we’ll start seeing truly dramatic steps forward even more often this year.\n\nChariots are next. Just you wait.\n\n‍\n\nPart 4: I was told there would be no math\n\nThis section is for CIOs and finance folks. Hi. Thanks for reading this far.\n\nIn your FY26 planning that you just wrapped up a few weeks ago, how much opex budget did you put aside for developer LLM spend? Maybe a little? A lot? One company told me they were considering a generous budget of $25 per developer per day. That seems bold, like a lot of money. An almost reckless amount.\n\nWell, it turns out they were on the right track. Coding agents are très cher, muy caro, we're talking very, very expensive. They burn lots of LLM tokens, to the tune of $10-$12/hour at current rates. How much are your per-seat licenses for your coding assistant right now? Thirty a month? Ballpark? Maybe less?\n\nFor calculation purposes, as a rule of thumb, you can think of each coding agent instance as being approximately as valuable, amortized over this fiscal year, as having one additional junior level software developer on staff – provided that someone (human or AI) is keeping it mostly busy for 8-10 hours a day.\n\nThat’s a heck of a rule of thumb. I think you’ll agree that ten bucks an hour is a steal for a professional software engineer who just needs a good babysitter.\n\nSo it's going to be worth your while to budget more like $80-$100 of LLM spend per developer, per day. $30 a day is only going to be enough for three hours of camel rides, and then your devs go back to walking after lunch. But if you pay the full Ben Franklin, each of your devs will roughly double their output, since they can still work while playing nanny for a single coding agent. It’s a no-brainer.\n\nHowever.\n\nThe upcoming wave, which I'm calling \"agent clusters\" – the chariot I hinted at in the last section – should make landfall by Q3. This wave will enable each of your developers to run many agents at once in parallel, every agent working on a different task: bug fixing, issue refinement, new features, backlog grooming, deployments, documentation, literally anything a developer might do.\n\nEach of your devs will suddenly become like many devs. At least, the ones who are good at it will. (Foreshadowing: I smell revenge.)\n\nAgent clusters will have the side effect of finally moving software development into the cloud. People have been predicting cloud-based IDEs for decades! Right? Half of you have probably tried to build one at some point. They seem like such an obvious idea.\n\nBut it has always been more convenient to run IDEs locally, so cloud-based development never took off. The agent-clusters wave of H2 2025 will change that. Your dev desktop does not have enough power to run dozens of agents at once, let alone hundreds. The bulk of developer work will shift up to the cloud practically overnight.\n\nSo you probably need some more cloud budget.\n\nRunning N agents at once multiplies your devs' daily agent spend of $10/day by N, not counting cloud costs, just token burn. If your developers are each on average running, say, five agents at once – a very conservative number, since agents will work mostly independently, leaving the dev free to do other stuff – then those devs are each now spending $50/hr, or roughly $100k/year.\n\nIt’s not really a steal anymore, so much as a heist. We’re talking about each developer gradually boosting their productivity by a multiplier of ~5x by Q4 2025 (allowing for ramp-up time), for an additional amortized cost of only maybe $50k/year the first year. Who wouldn’t go for that deal?\n\nUnfortunately, you almost certainly didn't include $50k/year per developer of LLM spend in your 2026 operating budget. This situation will rapidly separate companies into the have-budgets and have-budget-nots, and the haves will, well, have it. The have-nots’ll hardly have half. Follow me?\n\nTo put it more bluntly: Software development is now a pay-to-play bullet train. If you can’t afford a ticket, you risk getting red-shifted away from the pack.\n\n‍\n\nPart 5: The agent fleet is coming\n\nHere's where it starts to get a little bit uncomfortable. If you’re already sweating, or feeling any kind of palpitations, maybe take a little break, grab a soda, dust off that resume, whatever. Take your time. Whenever you’re ready. We’ll wait.\n\nOK, from here on, you all promise you are chill, scout’s honor. Let’s do this.\n\nThe wave after clusters, or agent \"fleets\", for lack of a better word, will allow your developers to run 100+ agents at a time… with the help of yet more agents. Supervisory agents will be able to run groups or pods of coding agents, mediating on their behalf and only bringing in the human when agents get really stuck.\n\nThe new job of a software developer going forward will soon be managing dashboards of coding agents and their AI supervisors, as sketched in Figure 2: FY26 Org Chart. Some might derisively call this job babysitting, and accuse AIs of being little whiny baby robots that need a grownup to cut their food into little pieces, and change their diapers, and clean up their messes, and keep them from wandering out of their playpens. But we prefer to call it software development. This is our destiny.\n\nFor you CIO-types, fleets will enable your developers to spend thousands of dollars a day. Even if inference costs plummet, the Jevons Paradox will result in higher usage offsetting those costs. If you don’t believe that, go ask to see your bug backlog; it’s basically infinite.\n\nThousands a day!? But it's money incredibly well spent! Your engineering org will start to be able to go as fast as you want them to go, for once. Can you believe it? It'll be like being a startup again. You’ll be able to “surprise and delight your customers”, as Jeff Bezos is fond of saying, at an elite level you never dreamed possible.\n\nBut you're going to have to find a whole lot of new budget somewhere. Maybe you're lucky and your company has deep pockets. For instance I just heard, going to press here, that a big familiar brand you all know has a very large slush fund allocated for LLM experimentation this year. I wonder how many companies did that, and in doing so, perhaps unwittingly dodged this year’s budget-planning black swan event?\n\nIf after searching the couch for coins, you’re not able to scrape together an extra $50k per developer by EOY, maybe you can raise the money somehow. This probably plays better into the hands of startups than big companies right now. I think this agent thing has leveled a lot of playing fields.\n\nThe scary part of this story is that if you can’t find or raise money, and you want to stay competitive, then you're going to have to make painful cuts in order to free up the opex budget. And if you run the numbers again, there's only one department where it makes sense to cut.\n\nThe rest, I'm afraid, is an exercise for the reader. I have no idea what will happen. I’m just some dude. Maybe this is all overblown, and you’ll need to add six months to my projections before they come true. I argued with Claude about it for a while, and Claude capitulated and said it was plausible if I stretched all my estimates by six months. So the bad news mayn’t be all bad!\n\nAnd now for the good news! You did ask for the bad news first, didn’t you? Well regardless, it’s out of the way. It’s easy peasy from here, and we’re almost done. All that’s left is sweet, sweet revenge.\n\n‍\n\nPart 6: Revenge of the junior developer\n\nIt turns out, it’s not all doom and gloom ahead. Far from it! There will be a bunch of jobs in the software industry. Just not the kind that involve writing code by hand like some sort of barbarian.\n\nOne consistent pattern I’ve observed in the past year, since I published \"The death of the junior developer\", is that junior developers have actually been far more eager to adopt AI than senior devs. It’s not always true; a few folks have told us that their juniors are scared to use it because they think, somewhat irrationally, that it will take their jobs. (See: Behavioral regret theory. Thanks for the pointer Dr. Daniel Rock!)\n\nBut for the most part, junior developers – including (a) newly-minted devs, (b) devs still in school, and (c) devs who are still thinkin’ about school – are all picking this stuff up really fast. They grab the O’Reilly AI Engineering book, which all devs need to know cover to cover now, and they treat it as job training. They’re all using chat coding, they all use coding assistants, and I know a bunch of you junior developers out there are using coding agents already.\n\nJunior devs are vibing. They get it. The world is changing, and you have to adapt. So they adapt!\n\nWhereas senior developers are, well… struggling, to put it gently. I have no shortage of good friends, old-timers like me, who have basically never touched an LLM or even seen one naked. Plenty of others have only barely dabbled with coding assistants. I even hear about senior developer cohorts, from many industry leaders, who take a flat-out stand against it.\n\nExample: a tech director at a well-known brand just told me that one of their devs sent them a PDF explaining, with color slides and charts, why they all needed to abandon AI and go back to regular coding. Now do you see what I meant when I said we have the widest distribution of understanding in tech history? There are people who still think this is like, crypto or something. Yikes!\n\nLook, some senior devs are struggling, no doubt, because they’re just busy. I get it. But I think for most of them, there’s something deeper going on. When I used to blog about programming languages, I found that simply saying that I liked some programming language, any language at all, would get me in surprisingly serious hot water. People would yell in threads, digital spittle flying everywhere. I didn’t get what was going on. All this, just because I said I liked a language?\n\nAfter several years I figured out that it’s because they felt if people listened to me, then everyone would switch to that language, and then the senior devs would have to learn it too. They equated having to learn something new – and I mean really new, sort of like starting over – with losing their job and their health insurance and going bankrupt and dying outside a hospital on the steps. It’s just human nature at work, in the face of big uncertain change.\n\nI believe the AI-refusers regrettably have a lot invested in the status quo, which they think, with grievous mistakenness, equates to job security. They all tell themselves that the AI has yet to prove that it’s better than they are at performing X, Y, or Z, and therefore, it’s not ready yet.\n\nBut from where I’m sitting, they’re the ones who aren’t ready. I lay this all out in detail, my friends, so you can help yourselves.\n\nRegardless of why the luddites aren’t adopting it, they have lost. Junior devs have the high ground, and the battle is now over. Not only are junior devs on average adopting AI faster, but junior devs are also – surprise! – cheaper. If companies are going to make cuts to pay for their devs to win with tokens, which devs do you think they’re gonna keep?\n\nThe AI holdouts don’t see any of this this coming yet, so the junior devs are going to have to lower their light sabers and shout this message down from the hilltop above:\n\nIt’s not AI’s job to prove it’s better than you. It’s your job to get better using AI.\n\nOtherwise, you get… the else clause. You know. The else clause. The lava. You fall in. Why do I have to spell this out?\n\nSo! Here we are, at the end of the movie. You made it. High five, junior devs! ✋I didn’t see this coming last year, but I’m very impressed that you’ve managed to be the ones voting the losers off the island. And high five to those of you senior devs who have figured this out and are truckin’ along already. There aren’t as many of you as you’d think, at least outside the Bay Area Bubble.\n\nFor the rest of you… lean into it. Be like a Junior. Seriously. It doesn’t matter who you are, really, nor even if you’re a person or a company. Lean in. It’s time. AI is here.\n\nHere at Sourcegraph, we study the hell out of this problem space every day. We are working towards a world where all this stuff, despite being incredibly expensive, is astonishingly, and soon undeniably, valuable. To everyone who chooses to use it, anyway. Coding-agent armies are marching across the Rubicon, and getting them wired up to enterprise IP assets and code bases is the next big game in town. That’s where we’re focused.\n\nMore broadly, we all think there will be jobs. Lots of jobs. We think the flat hiring right now is just companies signalling that they don’t know what to do yet. But this very fiscal year, companies of all shapes and sizes can be more ambitious than ever before, and I say that without a hint of hyperbole. If history is any indicator, from steam to electricity to computing, we’re going to see vastly more people creating software soon. The resulting productivity wave may boost national GDPs by astonishing amounts, 100% or more.\n\nBut to participate, you're going to have to learn the next wave. As a developer, heck, even if you’re a PM or literally any tech-adjacent role – you need to catch up on coding agents, and stay caught up. No more dallying and dabbling. Figure out how to use an automatic coding agent right now, and don't give up until you know how to wield it. Push on it until it works for you.\n\nAnd don’t get cocky and try to push it too hard. A coding agent is like a big-ass tunnel borer machine when you've been using power shovels. It is strong, sure, hella strong. But it is expensive, it can still get stuck badly, and you need to guide it carefully at all times. And it's not that fast – it's not going to bore through the English Channel in a day. So don't set unrealistic expectations going in. Just focus on how different this stuff is from 2 years ago when ChatGPT came out, and then marvel at how different it is from 2 months ago when the best we had was chat.\n\nHave fun with it. It’s called vibe coding for a reason. It turns out not writing code is pretty easy.\n\nDon’t fall prey to the tempting work-deferral trap. Saying “It’ll be way faster in 6 months, so I’ll just push this work out 6 months” is like saying, “I’m going to wait until traffic dies down.” Your drive will be shorter, sure. But you will arrive last.\n\nAgents are coming. Vast fleets of them. Not just coding agents. Agents are arising everywhere, across entire businesses and production tech processes. I talked to a big customer this morning who has already built dozens to hundreds of \"AI task machines\" – custom-built agents that perform specific parts of their giant workflows. The future is now. Agents are here.\n\nIf you’re looking for a call to action, then I give the same advice to both humans and companies: Switch to chat. Ditch completions. Stop writing code by hand. Learn how validation and verification work in the new world. Familiarize yourself with the space, and follow the state of the art. Stop whinging and turn this into an engineering exercise. Stay on top of it. You can do it.\n\nAbove all, pay close attention to the new coding agents. They may be nigh-unusable for most devs today, but not for long. Not long at all. They are incredibly expensive productivity machines – and at bargain-basement prices compared to humans. Tough choices ahead for all.\n\nThe new job of “software engineer,” by the end of this year, will involve little direct coding, and a lot of agent babysitting. The sooner you get on board with that, the easier your life will be.\n\nIf you’re really not sure what to do after reading this far, go ask a junior developer for help.\n\nThat's pretty much it. We are coming up to the 2-year anniversary of \"Cheating is all you need\". It’s absolutely insane how much has changed since then. If I could send this blog post back in time, my 2-years-ago self wouldn’t believe it.\n\nThanks to my boss Quinn Slack for blowing our minds with most of these ideas a week ago. Hope you found this useful in some way. I'm off to fart on some investors. Ciao!\n\n‍",
      "# [Sourcegraph went dark](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41296481)\nThanks for being a fan. And I understand it's a bummer to not have our code be public and open-source anymore. Sorry.\n\nIt's a bunch of reasons that add up. I'll give some more details for anyone curious.\n\n(And I know that despite these reasons, lots of HNers probably wish it was not so. I agree! I too wish for a world where all companies could have their code be public and open source.)\n\n- We have a lot of tech around large-scale code graph, indexing, etc., stuff that is very differentiated and hard to build. We were starting to put some of this in separate private repositories and link them in at build time, but that was complex. It added a lot of code complexity, risked bugs, and slowed us down, and if a lot of the awesome stuff was private anyway, what was the point?\n\n- As we've been building Cody (https://cody.dev), our code AI tool, we've seen a LOT more abuse. That's what happens when you offer any free tier of a product with LLM inference. We had to move a lot more of our internal backend abuse logic to private repositories, and it added code complexity to incorporate that private stuff in at build time.\n\n- It confused devs and customers to have 2 releases: an open-source release with less scaley/enterprisey features, and an enterprise release. It was a pain to migrate from one to the other (GitLab also felt this pain with their product) because the open-source build had a subset of the DB schema and other things. It was confusing to have a free tier on the enterprise release (lots of people got that mixed up with the open-source release), and it made our pricing and packaging complex so that lots of our time was spent helping customers understand what is paid and what isn't.\n\n- There were actually very very few companies that were going to pay but then decided to use the open-source version and not pay us. A lot of people probably assume that's why we made this move, but it's not. I think this is because people like the product and see value in it, including all the large-scale code nav/search features that are in our enterprise version.\n\n- Although very very few companies used our open-source version to avoid paying us, we did see it cause a lot of annoyance for devs who were asked by their management to try cloning our product or to research our codebase to give their procurement team ammunition to negotiate down our price. This honestly was just a waste of everyone's time.\n\n- If we got a ton of contributions (we never really solicited any), then it might've changed the calculus. Sourcegraph is an end-user application that you use at work (and when fun-coding, but the primary revenue model is for us to charge companies). For various reason, end-user server-side applications just don't get nearly as many contributions. Maybe it's because you'd need to redeploy your build for a bunch of other users at your company, not just yourself. Maybe it's because they necessarily entail UX, frontend, and scaling stuff, in addition to just adding new features.\n\n- We heard from people who left GitHub that people at GitHub were frequently monitoring our repository to get wind of our upcoming features and launches. Someone from GitHub told me his \"job is to clone Sourcegraph\". Since then, they obviously deprioritized their code search to re-found GitHub on AI, so we're not seeing this threat anymore. But I didn't love giving Microsoft an unfair advantage, especially since GitHub products are not open source either.\n\n- Since we made our code non-open-source, we've been able to pursue a lot more big partnerships (e.g., with cloud providers and other distribution partners and resellers). This is a valuable revenue stream that helps us make a better product overall. Again, because Sourcegraph is an end-user application with a UI that devs constantly use and care about, we never really had the MongoDB/Redis/CockroachDB risk of AWS/GCP/Azure just deploying our stuff and cutting us out. We're not protecting from downside here, but we are enjoying the upside because now those kinds of distribution partnerships are viable for us. To give a specific example, within ~2 months of making our code non-open-source last year, we signed a $1M+ ARR deal through a distribution partner that would not have happened if our code was open source. This is not our biggest annual deal, but it's still really nice!\n\nWe are totally focused on building the best code search/intelligence and appreciate all our customers and all the feedback here. Hope this helps explain a bit more where we're coming from!\n\nI don't see any attempt to veil it -- there was specific mention of revenue and competitors\n\nDid SourceGraph make any promises about a community or free support? (honest question)\n\nI think your expectations may be off, perhaps learned from corporate marketing. \"Open source\" by itself does not mean necessarily\n\n1. you get any support\n\n2. there is a community [1]\n\n3. you're entitled to all future source code by that person or company, whether under the same project name or not.\n\n---\n\nIt could be that SourceGraph has broken some promises, and that IS pretty typical of VC-backed companies.\n\nBut so far I don't see evidence of that.\n\nQuoting my comment: https://lobste.rs/s/tg5vwi/sourcegraph_went_dark#c_vnaqxu\n\nEven according to Stallman, free software never required any kind of support, open development, or commit history. You can publish a tarball on a web server, and that counts as free software.\n\ni.e. publishing source code doesn’t sign you up for a lifelong obligation. People can fork it, or not fork it.\n\n---\n\nPractically speaking, I might think of SourceGraph as something like Android.\n\nIs Android open source? Yes. [2]\n\nDoes it have huge proprietary parts? Yes.\n\nIt is designed for collaborative development? Not really unless you work for a big company, and are paid to work on Android. (That said, I'm sure there are hobbyists / \"people in their basement\" that do meaningful things with Android source code -- and actually I think that is how some open phone companies started)\n\nIs it better than it's open rather than closed? Yes. Multiple competitors to Google use Android source code, e.g. Amazon has built phones off of it. That is good thing IMO.\n\n---\n\n[1] On my own open source projects, there is a community and best-effort support, and I really encourage that! But the point is that there are MULTIPLE valid project models under the name \"open source\".\n\nThrowing code over the wall is actually valid open source, and it actually benefits society IMO. It's still valuable, even if you STOP doing it, as SourceGraph has done.\n\nIt's distinct from \"I get free stuff that I like using\"\n\nThere could be a different name for \"unfunded or independently funded open source\", but the funny thing is that the term \"open source\" originated as a corporate-friendly alternative to \"free software\"\n\n[2] As a tangent, I also think Android has a really suboptimal and cloud-slanted architecture, but for this discussion, let's just use it as a an example of corporate open source",
      "# [The death of the junior developer](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/the-death-of-the-junior-developer)\nWarning: This blog post is somewhat speculative; the sky might not be falling. But my spidey-sense is definitely tingling. The way we are all doing our jobs in software is changing, potentially in big ways. So let's think of this as a thought exercise.\n\nWith that disclaimer, we're off!\n\nI have been chatting with a bunch of both junior and senior developer-type folk at different companies lately. By cross-barfticulating these conversations I've picked up on an emerging new pattern, which is that like 80% of you are way smarter than me. My goodness. What have I been doing?\n\nBut also another pattern, which is that a lot of people picked a bad year to be a junior developer. A whole lot of people. I wouldn't want to be just getting started in the industry today.\n\nNot just the computer industry. Any industry. It's a bad year to be a junior anything.\n\nMy wife Linh and I are huge horror-movie buffs. So, to reflect the somber theme of today's rant, I will use horror movie titles to introduce our sections.\n\nLet's start by talking about what's happening to junior developers.\n\nThe Purge (2013)\n\nOur first story of the day is about a law firm and has nothing to do with programming. But it is indeed centrally relevant to the crisis that is just starting to loom ominously, as crises love to do. My buddy Gene Kim gave me permission to share this story about his friend who is a managing partner at a 50-person law firm.\n\nIn short, one might surmise that all hell is breaking loose at said law firm because of ChatGPT, with some wondering whether the entire structure of their firm, which has been stable for a very long time, might now be completely wrong. Their whole comp structure, pensions, succession planning, everything is going through an existential crisis due to a frigging chatbot.\n\nThe problem, you see, is that there could be a future where they don't need junior associates anymore.\n\nIncreasingly, they need only senior associates, who (a) describe the tasks to be done; i.e., create the prompts, and (b) review the resulting work for accuracy and correctness. The high-end LLMs do so well with tasks normally fielded by junior associate lawyers, that there isn't much room left for the real junior associates on payroll.\n\nThe LLM can produce research, summaries, briefs, contracts, memos, pleadings, petitions - anything they need. All the documents it creates are \"perfect\"...with the catch that if someone senior doesn't double check its work before a judge sees it you might wind up in jail or something.\n\nCatching the LLM in a hallucination, catching a junior associate in a mistake - pretty similar. Really just two options for generating the same output. Except one of those options is fast and tireless and essentially free. And the other one puked on the chocolate fountain at the holiday party.\n\nWhew. You picked a bad year to be a junior associate lawyer, that's for damn sure. Sorry, graduating class of 2024. Sucks to be you.\n\nThe Shining (1980)\n\nGene shared the law-firm story to illustrate how widespread this problem is. He suggests that the same chaos, which is undoubtedly unfolding across legal firms everywhere, could affect all writing and editorial jobs. You can imagine a world where demand for junior writers and editors starts to evaporate.\n\nMarket forces are nudging everyone towards having senior writers who are also good prompt engineers: An arrangement that meets all of their needs faster and cheaper than hiring junior humans.\n\nGene, as an accomplished and senior author, is delighted with his productivity gains with his LLM of choice, Claude Opus. He showed me a big writing project that he'd just finished, in which he had spent easily 45+ minutes crafting the prompt, refining it until he had a 7500-word narrative that could serve as a starting point for rewriting, editing, and adjustment. Claude generated that 7500-word draft from his prompt. (In comparison, this blog post is about half that size.) And that draft was fantastic. I've read it and it's glorious.\n\nOn a good day, Gene can write 1,000 words per day. His estimate is that Claude did for him in 90 minutes what would normally have taken him ten days. It solves the \"blank-page problem\" and gets him to the 20-yard line, where the fun begins.\n\nHe estimates using an LLM as a writing tool gets him there 2-3x faster now, helping him meet his personal requirements and quality bar.\n\nGene could not be happier, at least for himself, because in addition to being faster, he also feels working this way is more fun. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, right? He's a happy dude.\n\nBut he is terrified for his teenage kids.\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)\n\nAnecdote: I watched the pod scene from the original black and white 50s version of this movie when I was about 8, and wow, that was traumatizingly scary. My wife has also been watching horror movies since she was about 4 (!) and we share a deep love of horror, probably because we're all messed up from childhood.\n\nWe've just seen the same plot play out for the legal profession and writing/editing jobs, where LLMs are threatening to out-people the people. Let's watch the same movie again in some genres closer to home.\n\nJust a few days ago our illustrious Head of AI, Rishabh Mehrotra, was showing me a classifier and multi-class prediction model that he had trained and deployed in a single day with ChatGPT. He said it would have been a 6-week University senior-level intern project a year ago. This is affecting data science too.\n\nAn old friend, great programmer and mathematician, who left AI for quantum computing for a few years, is back to programming. He confided - somewhat excitedly - that even though he does a lot of programming, he doesn't consider himself a programmer anymore.\n\nHe said he's more of a reviewer, or coach, or nanny, something like that. He makes ChatGPT do all the work and he just crafts prompts and reviews the output.\n\nThat resonated with me, since I, too, have been replaced by a bubble-bath plant pod body snatcher who pretends to be a programmer, but is in fact outsourcing almost all of it.\n\nNaturally, when I say \"make ChatGPT do all the work\", there is plenty of coding we still do by hand. What I mean is that chat-first is the default, and writing by hand (with completions, naturally!) is our fallback plan. My quantum friend and I are both finding much less need for that fallback recently.\n\nSince then I've found several other super amazing colleagues who have also adopted this coding strategy to accelerate themselves. And frankly it has been a bit of a relief to hear confirmation coming from so many great people that chat-first programming is indeed a New Thing.\n\nThe Thing (1982)\n\nIs it really new? Clearly this \"New Thing\" has already been around in other domains, since even the original ChatGPT was able to replace a lot of human labor.\n\nBut for coding, let's be serious here, chat coding has sucked. It would often be more effort to coax the LLM into a working solution than to write it yourself.\n\nWith the previous model generations, if you feed in an 800-line source code file and ask for substantial changes, even GPT4-Turbo (which many of you are using right now) will often run amok: Well-argued hallucinations, code that fails to parse, snarky \"code left as an exercise\" empty functions, designs leading you in circles going nowhere, unexpected refactorings, missing code, and all manner of other frustration.\n\nYou've probably tried it yourself. You know what I mean.\n\nSo chat programming has been sort of a bust. Nowadays most people equate AI coding assistants with code autocompletions. They think of chat as something you use when you're just starting out, maybe as a faster docs search.\n\nIn fact, there is a widespread perception that chat is for junior developers, and becomes less useful as you gain experience.\n\nAnd truth be told, this wasn't entirely inaccurate prior to mid-May. The models weren't quite there yet.\n\nBut for the past six weeks, things have been very, very different, and YOU my friend are missing out. That perception that chat is for juniors is now a flat-out misconception, one that I pray is stone dead in your heart by the end of this post.\n\nChopping Mall (1986)\n\nChat-based programming, which I will preemptively label Chat Oriented Programming (CHOP) or just \"chop\", because I suspect I'll be saying it a lot, is a brand-spanking new phenomenon. Like, seriously, just over a month old. I first noticed it when GPT-4o came out, which was mid-May.\n\nYou remember that big manufactured drama, right, about the new OpenAI \"4o\" GPT model supposedly having Scarlett Johansson's voice? That's the one.\n\nThat model changed everything about programming overnight.\n\nWhen GPT-4o dropped, it could suddenly edit 1000-line source files-a figure that encompasses 95+% of the source files in most repos worldwide-with tremendous precision and faithfulness to the original, leaving the untouched parts of the file 99.9% diff-perfect. Every once in a very rare while I see it drop a space character, or slightly mis-indent a line. But that's it.\n\nFrom what I've seen, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus have also cleared this hurdle. Which makes multi-model prompting a good bulwark against hallucinations, and a great way to select the best candidate for a design. Just feed your query to all of them and make 'em fight it out. It's a common CHOP technique.\n\nBriefly, CHOP is coding via iterative prompt refinement. Everyone's attempts to get it to do anything complex used to peter out after 4 to 5 iterations, and the models couldn't make progress. But now your iterations usually converge, which means you're reviewing and ultimately approving more and more LLM code, and writing less and less yourself.\n\nSo programming has leveled up into a problem of explaining your situation to the LLM - that is, slinging context, since you'll want to include a lot of information from different sources - and then merging the output back into your code base.\n\nWe'd better get a tool for this. Chop chop!\n\nUpgrade (2018)\n\nThe big model upgrade was life-changing for people who have already been coding in raw ChatGPT, which is still the world's most-used and most popular AI coding assistant. ChatGPT coders have been using chop style for a year or more, but it has been only for the bravest, most patient, and dumbest of early adopters. Whereas now it's ready for everyone!\n\nOf course, raw chat involves a lot of manual assembly of context in and shoveling responses out, and it can get tedious, so many programmers use coding assistants instead. (I mean, I guess business is good if you are the CTRL, C, or V keys on a keyboard. Or ⌘ if you are into that sort of thing.)\n\nAll AI coding assistants benefit from this upgrade, too. It has certainly been huge for our coding assistant Cody, which in my opinion has the best chat due to our automated context assembly engine, which saves you from having to explain your code base every time. Plus Cody Pro lets you use both GPT-4o and Claude (and others), so you can spot-check all your work with another LLM.\n\nThe model upgrade is arguably even more effective with our inline edits feature, which handles dropping the response directly into your code. No more shoveling code out of the chat window. Cody just changes your code in place, undoably and retryably. The models are getting smarter, but the integration with your workflow is getting tighter as well.\n\nWhat's happening is a big deal. Programming this way is arguably on its way to being an order of magnitude speedup from completions-based programming. A 10x improvement might sound like an exaggeration. But we just saw examples from legal practice, publishing, and data science in the same ballpark, with 5-30x speedups for certain kinds of tasks, and estimates of at least 2-3x overall boost to productivity.\n\nYou can quibble over the numbers, but it's clear that programmers using CHOP with these new models are getting a turbo boost.\n\nWhy aren't you upgraded yet?\n\nThe Mangler (1995)\n\nTrivia: My brother told me that movie was so scary that he had to leave the theater. Never saw it myself, but the short story was fun.\n\nWe're going to do story #5 now, the very last story, and it's mine, and it's about programming, and the plot is different from the others.\n\nThis is where we learn the hard way why chat programming is for senior devs. Please keep your hands and limbs inside the carriage during the ride.\n\nThe other day GPT-4o shocked me with one of its coding proposals, while I was chopping away with it at a project. It was such a shock that I laughed for minutes, practically unhinged. I am not often shocked, least of all by looking at the code for a working program.\n\nI had presented a small design problem to GPT, asking for an evaluation of my options. It's great for that. Chat-oriented programming (CHOP) isn't just about coding. There are a lot of design discussions too. You do everything, even writing sometimes, with the LLM as a pair partner.\n\nFor some reason, this time ChatGPT launched full-bore into redesigning an entire subsystem of the framework I was stuck in, which had an issue I was trying to work around. I'm sure you have seen this wack behavior from LLMs before. The difference is, now they are very good at rewriting things, and sometimes they'll swing for the fences, consequences schmonsequences.\n\nGPT-4o breezed quickly past most of the sane options before plowing straight into \"let's rewrite it all\" scorched-earth mode, clearly not having read Joel Spolsky. It spewed out an unusually long answer, hundreds of lines of code and instructions, presenting thorough and persuasive reasoning supporting this approach.\n\nAnd the rewrite would have worked! It was a very direct solution to my problem. So it wasn't \"wrong\" per se. There are rarely things in design that are truly wrong - like, wrong wrong - as there are exceptions to most rules.\n\nThere was only one teeny tiny issue with it, which is that it would have killed someone.\n\nNot on my project, hopefully! But if the model is currently spitting out similar suggestions to people working on software that controls giant saws in machine shops, someone's gonna die.\n\nCabin in the Woods (2011)\n\nGPT's redesign was awful - but not when you looked directly at it. Up close it was downright cozy.\n\nYou had to pull back and look at the design in the broader context of its interactions with other subsystems, but also support, maintenance, upgrades, add-ons, and a bunch of other dimensions that are critically important to software design and engineering. With that wider lens, it was an Unbreakable-level train wreck waiting to happen.\n\nBut it was wearing a superb disguise. A less experienced dev would surely have fallen for it. I could feel the power and the attraction of the approach it was espousing, the force of the arguments backing it. The whole thing was appealingly packaged, technically correct, and laid out for you to just take it and run! (My pal Chris Smith says the word I'm looking for is \"specious\". So yeah, that.)\n\nAnd it just hit me all at once how hilariously inappropriate and potentially dangerous this answer was. It was so impressive and so spooky. I laughed and laughed, like a little kid watching bubble bath plant monsters replacing all the people.\n\nMy senior colleagues have recently recounted similar chat scenarios in which a more junior dev would have been completely taken in, potentially losing days to weeks of work going the wrong direction.\n\nOr worse.\n\nChat, it seems, is safer for senior programmers than it is for junior ones. And a lot of companies are going to interpret \"safer\" to mean \"better.\"\n\nBuckle up. Topsy-turvy times ahead.\n\nThe Stand (2020)\n\nA lot of companies ask me, how can we tell which parts were written by the AI and which parts by the programmer? Well, if chat-oriented programming becomes the dominant modality for programmers, then LLMs will be writing the vast majority of all source code worldwide. That's a gargantuan shift, and it might even shake up the traditional software engineering roles.\n\nWe've seen how this shift affected a law firm, a publisher, and engineering's sibling discipline of data science. Stock in junior contributors is down, and there is concern there could be a market crash.\n\nThat presents a very serious problem for new people in those fields. What do you do? How do you learn the ropes, not to mention find gainful employment? What are the ropes now? And what do the companies do when their senior people retire?\n\nThey could wind up like the COBOL world which is in a worldwide crunch, because there are no junior COBOL devs to replace the ones who retired. Ironically, these huge legacy companies will likely be rooting hardest for the LLMs to write all their code.\n\nThings are changing fast. I'm an optimist, and I generally think, or at least hope, that as companies become more productive in the coming months and years, they simply get correspondingly more ambitious.\n\nEveryone will need to get a lot more serious about testing and reviewing code. Senior devs could become full-time reviewers and junior devs shepherd the LLMs, maybe?\n\nIt doesn't necessarily have to end with a post-apocalyptic wasteland for recent CS grads.\n\n28 Days Later (2002)\n\nI wrote this post a week ago and have been thinking hard about whether I believe the premise, which is that within a few years, the norm for source code will be that it is written and modified by LLMs via prompting. For all practical purposes, all source code will be written this way, with exceptions becoming ever rarer.\n\nNot only do I believe it, I could even see it happening in 12-18 months at the current rate of LLM progress. I think the change will have a ton of fallout, only some of it foreseeable. And one casualty might well be junior devs, in the sense that they become less marketable and it could cause various kinds of crunches across the industry.\n\nWe've already seen the big companies doing eng layoffs to make room for AI practitioners. Small companies may be faced with their own version of this decision: Why hire a junior developer to write mediocre code, when the LLM will do that for you ten times faster?\n\nSo yeah. I'm worried.\n\nBriefly, what do I mean by \"senior\" here? Really just two things:\n\nYou know what you want before the AI writes it. You already have a vision for how you would write this by hand, or have it narrowed to a few reasonable options.\n\nYou can detect when it is giving you bad guidance.\n\nIf you know exactly where you are driving, and you know what bad roads look like, then turbochargers can be safe and will get you there faster. If you're not sure where you're driving, activating the turbochargers will get you somewhere fast.\n\nLeave the World Behind (2023)\n\nSo. You've made it this far. Congrats!. What's going to happen? I don't know. Maybe we'll get really lucky. I mean, I'd be very happy to be wrong here.\n\nBut change is coming. There will be social and cultural upheaval in tech, just as is happening in the legal profession. It's already begun. The models are getting smarter and smarter with each passing month, which means they are going to be eating more and more jobs until they eat the world.\n\nAll I can tell you is this: Get there early. One time Googlers were complaining at TGIF that the parking garage was filling up by midmorning, and Larry Page jokingly suggested, \"Maybe you should come earlier.\" At that moment he reeked of billionaire. But if you really wanted to park in the garage, you took his advice.\n\nIf you want to survive the change, you'd better show up prepared and stay on top of it.\n\nThe rest of this post is just some direct, simple, and timeless advice for junior and aspiring software engineers. I hope it can help get you through this awkward period where our industry collectively figures out what exactly the hell is going to happen.\n\nFinal Destination (2000)\n\nGet good, fast. That's what you need to do. Get ahead of the slackers while our industry turns upside down, and you might be the one to survive.\n\nYou are competing with students from Waterloo, who have 2+ years of actual work experience by the time they graduate with a bachelor's in CS. You're also competing with the top 10% of all CS grads nationwide, who are, year after year, already effectively senior engineers, despite this being their first real job.\n\nHere are some shotgun recommendations. Do with them as you see fit.\n\nGain experience anywhere and any way you can, before you even leave school. Get work experience, contribute to OSS, program on the side. Take your classes seriously. Learn more than is required for passing each class. Learn each subject thoroughly, and revisit them all as you go.\n\nDon't over-index on programming language arcana. That's becoming a detail that machines handle for us. Focus on algorithms, data structures, software design and engineering, discrete math, operating systems, compilers, databases, networks. Focus on studying real systems. Find walkthroughs online and study them. And of course ML. Gobble up everything you can.\n\nUnderstand how things are built. Make sure you know how every system in a computer works. Make sure you have an understanding of how every cloud service you depend on does its job. Read the docs, and then read the design docs. You won't have to write any of it by hand. But you need to develop a senior programmer's sensibilities around how these things fit together and interact, for good or ill.\n\nLearn how to use frontier models to check other LLM models' work. Sign up for multiple services (e.g. Claude and ChatGPT) and send your important prompts to at least two big models. Have them evaluate each other's responses and study it all carefully. LLMs are better at reviewing and critiquing their own content than they are at producing it. So use a second LLM as your senior partner.\n\nAnother one of the key things that differentiates a senior developer from a junior one, in many contexts, is Operations experience. Read the O'Reilly/Google SRE book. Read it cover to cover. And find a good GitOps book, too; there seem to be quite a few to choose from. There may be no compression algorithm for experience, but fortunately a lot of that experience has been condensed and distilled. Go drink it up.\n\nLean hard on a coding assistant like Cody. Stay on the bleeding edge of features. A coding assistant is a powerful tool, like an IDE, and learning to master it will level you up as a programmer. CHOP involves a lot of manual context shoveling to craft your prompt. Cody does 90% of that shoveling for you, as well as copying the responses back into your code.\n\nMost devs using chat still use raw ChatGPT for coding, even though it doesn't help you with context fetching or data shoveling. And it's great all by itself, though more manual work in prompt crafting. I have been using GPT directly in Emacs, with the excellent chatgpt-shell, because I'm still building Cody for Emacs so I can't use it yet. Raw GPT-4o is still great.\n\nI used to tell people to master an IDE, and even better, also Emacs or Neovim. But I'm not sure anymore. That might become obsolete soon. Wait until the coding assistants can do it for you; it won't be long. Or even come help.\n\nIt doesn't matter what approach you take, as long as you start making heavy use of chat in programming. Because that, friendo, is how it works now. Like it or not. And you need to survive it. Good luck to you.\n\nI will start a channel soon dedicated to showing the new way of programming, as I help build Cody using chop-style coding. I will use both ChatGPT directly and Cody, and they will help me build Cody. Stay tuned!\n\nI'll also be giving a talk that touches on this and much more in August at the Enterprise Technology Leadership Summit in Las Vegas. Hope to see you there.\n\nP.S. Thanks to Chris Smith, Gene Kim, Dominic Cooney, and Anna Noak for their thorough reviews and great suggestions.",
      "# [Issues with Cody Not Finding Relevant Files Compared to Cursor on 2024-08-19](https://community.sourcegraph.com/t/issues-with-cody-not-finding-relevant-files-compared-to-cursor/908)\nI just want to let the developers know that I’m getting “empty” results in terms of file numbers when asking questions that Cursor can easily handle. For example, when I ask something like, “Where is the movement system for characters in this game?” Cursor successfully identifies the main Movement script along with several other related scripts. However, Cody fails to find any relevant files and instead provides explanations based on the project name, without identifying the actual files. This isn’t an isolated issue—it’s the same for any other questions I ask. Because of this, I’ve completely stopped using Cody for navigating my codebase.\n\nJust to clarify, in case it matters: my projects are Unity projects with 10-200 scripts, many folders, and a functioning Codyignore file (which excludes plenty of folders and files). I know the ignore file is working because Cody doesn’t interact with the ignored files.\n\nI’m open to the possibility that my issues are caused by an unstable Codyignore, but when I see articles like this one (Chat-oriented programming (CHOP) in action), “Let’s ask something a little more complex - such as how would I add a new LLM model to our Cody VS Code extension.” - I’m amazed that I can’t achieve anything even remotely similar. I’m curious if the developers are aware of these issues and if they are being worked on, or if I’m the only one experiencing this?\n\nHi there!\n\nWhile trying to take a screenshot, I managed to narrow down the issue a bit.\n\nA lot of it has to do with the language used for the query. When using Cursor, I’m used to making queries in a language other than English, and this usually doesn’t cause any issues. With Cody, things at least start working when I make queries in English (in both blended and embeddings modes). This partially resolves the problem for me… But an automatic translation of the query into English (which seems to be critical) would be much more convenient for many users whose native language is not English.\n\nWhat practically doesn’t work at all (or works strangely) in any language is the “Keyword” context mode. I noticed something else during testing: in this mode, it’s critical not to place punctuation marks immediately after the last letter. I’m attaching two screenshots in this mode. In one of them, the question mark is attached to the last word (and the chat can’t find any files), while in the other, it’s not (apparently, this is the correct way to search, but how would a user know this?)—and the chat finds a file, but it’s the wrong one! And that’s odd—it’s clear from the screenshot that I have a file with that name, which contains a class with that name. But Cody suggests a different file for some reason.\n\nRegarding the embeddings mode, as I found out earlier, it generally works in English. And I could probably rely on it. But there are two important nuances, especially the second one, which makes it difficult to do so, unlike with Cursor:\n\n3.1. First, Cody indexes everything, the entire project. In my case (a Unity game), it indexes 1000 times more than necessary, ignoring the ignore file. I’m not sure if this is good for subsequent efficiency, but I hope that during the queries, the ignore file will at least help avoid distractions. In any case, indexing a new project can take 20-30 minutes. I tried switching to the pre-release version (v1.31.1724080603), and maybe I misunderstood something, but it seems like no indexing happens at all in that version.\n\n3.2. More importantly, the indexing frequency. In Cursor, it happens every 10 minutes and can be initiated manually. Considering that the ignore file is taken into account there, it only takes a few seconds. When the indexing of updates happens in Cody, I don’t understand at all. Sometimes something significant changes in the project within minutes, and waiting for it for weeks (or however long it takes) seems strange. I know that you can delete the corresponding files for re-indexing, but then you’ll have to wait another 30 minutes.\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time on these experiments and descriptions for you, and I hope that this helps improve something.\n\n.\n\n!/.cody\n\n!.ignore\n\n!/Assets/\n\n/Assets/*\n\n!/Assets/Scripts/\n\n!.txt\n\n!.cs",
      "# [The death of the stubborn developer](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/the-death-of-the-stubborn-developer)\nI wrote a blog post back in May called The Death of the Junior Developer. It made people mad. My thesis has since been corroborated by a bunch of big companies, and it is also happening in other industries, not just software. It is a real, actual problem, despite being quite inconvenient for almost everyone involved.\n\nMy beehive-kicking post’s main premise is pretty simple and can be visualized in terms of two different kinds of task that arise on software projects.\n\nAs any old-salt Project Manager knows all too well, every nontrivial project implicitly has a task graph consisting of multiple tasks, complete with subtasks and dependencies.\n\nMany of those graph nodes are leaf-node tasks, like “write an auth library” or “modernize these unit tests”. They tend to be fairly self-contained. We often give these leaf node tasks to junior developers because the scope is small.\n\nThe other kind are tasks that combine the leaf tasks in various ways, to deliver the actual project and all its subprojects. If you’re building a car, you can have all the individual parts 3D printed for you, which is more or less what LLMs are doing for code. But someone still needs to build the car.\n\nThose higher-level, interior task-graph nodes often involve a lot of planning and coordination.\n\nHere’s the rub: As of about May, LLMs can now execute most of the leaf tasks and even some higher-level interior tasks, even on large software projects. Which is great. But what’s left over for humans is primarily the more difficult planning and coordination nodes. Which are not the kind of task that you typically give junior developers.\n\nSo what the hell are junior developers supposed to work on, exactly? How do they level up now?\n\nMy CTA: they had better learn chat-oriented programming, “or else”.\n\nThat was my post, in a nutshell. Bit of an oversimplification, but close enough for today. It really caused a stir. But what I don’t think people fully grok is that even if the furor has waned, the problem itself is not over — it’s just starting.\n\nIn hindsight, junior is the wrong characterization. I’ve talked to a lot of people about the word “junior” here for software devs, and we all agree that it’s not the right term. There’s definitely a category of devs who are getting left behind, but it’s clearly much more nuanced than being all about junior devs.\n\nJunior devs are deeply affected, though, and it’s a concern.\n\nOne problem is that the circuit that lets junior developers grow into senior developers is broken or at least damaged. I’m borrowing an apt analogy from Dr. Matt Beane, who describes the same phenomenon happening with junior surgeons due to the emergence of surgery robots. Very similar situation: The task graph leaf nodes are automated now, so we don’t need (as many) junior contributors.\n\nHowever, some junior engineers pick this new stuff up and fly with it, basically upleveling themselves. And many senior engineers seem to be heading towards being left behind. So what is it, then?\n\nI’ve recently talked to two polar-opposite companies — one where the juniors have adopted chop, but the seniors stubbornly refuse, saying it’s a gimmick. And another where the seniors have adopted chop, but the juniors refuse, the reason being that they think it will take their jobs. It’s craziness out there.\n\nSo coming up with the right characterization here is tricky. How can you specify in one swoop which devs are in the most trouble here?\n\nWe’ve managed to narrow it down to a single principle: You are getting left behind if you do not adopt chat-based programming as your primary modality.\n\nThere are a few legitimate reasons for not being able to use chop, but they are quickly evaporating as excuses.\n\nSo call it whatever you like, but to me, as time goes by, the holdouts are just looking stubborn.\n\nBut why am I specifically calling out chat-based programming? It’s because chatting with the LLM is how you get those task-graph leaf nodes 3D printed for you. It’s an integral part of the whole process.\n\nSo chatting is how programming is increasingly being conducted in the wild, as we speak. It’s not off-mark to say the job of “software engineer” is changing forever, and all coding, even updates, will eventually be done via chat. And remember, it’s chat with something that hallucinates wildly, so it’s not exactly the solid slam-dunk leap forward that we all wish it were. But it is such a boost that the economics are driving everyone that direction anyway.\n\nIn my blog post I called this phenomenon Chat-Oriented Programming, CHOP for short (or just chop). Chop isn’t just the future, it’s the present. And if you’re not using it, you’re starting to fall behind the ones who are.\n\nI’m going to stop qualifying this assertion as my opinion, because at this point it is entering into well-established fact territory. Here at Sourcegraph we have many partners and customers who are sharing with us the results of their internal studies, across a range of coding assistants. This has given us perhaps broader perspective than many.\n\nThe broad conclusion is that switching to chop gives enterprise engineers a minimum boost of 30% in productivity across the board — even when the engineers are grumbling and think they are slower with it. That number is conservative, and some report higher. Moreover many of those studies were early days.\n\nThe baseline productivity boost should continue to grow everywhere as foundation models, tools, and the art of chop all mature. And it’s not capped at 100% (2x). It can easily go to 10x, 20x or more in some situations.\n\nThat, friends, is addictive. Random reinforcement for the win! Chop is fun for the adrenaline rush alone. Helps make up for the times you’re stomping around cursing at it.\n\nSo chop’s a thing. It’s happening already. Last I checked, I think ChatGPT was still the world’s most-used coding assistant, and it doesn’t do completions, only chop. Chop has a big following.\n\nThe only remaining room for differing opinions here is on how long chop will last. In my totally unproven but educated guess, it will be at least three years. In fact I think there’s a good chance it lasts up to ten years, given how long it took for assembly language to finally die.\n\nThat’s my opinion: We’re stuck with chop for years to come.\n\nThere is another camp of very smart people who have a different opinion from mine, and I want to represent them fairly. I’ll do my best. They don’t disagree that it exists today. But they lean towards thinking that chop will be short-lived, because it will be replaced with autonomous agents in various forms and flavors.\n\nThe basis for the disagreement is twofold, I think. First, chop is hard. You have to be a skilled computer user to make it work well. Not so much a skilled developer, as a skilled hacker, I guess. You need to type fast, read fast, use tools well, and have the chops (ahem) to sling large quantities of text and context around manually.\n\nSo a lot of people are worried that chop isn’t for the masses. And the masses have money, which of course makes it a question of some interest at the moment, here at the end of 2024.\n\nChat-oriented programming is hard, but many folks believe that autonomous agents are right around the corner, and that they will handle all that heavy lifting for you. You’ll just need to write short prompts and spot-check the results, with much less toil involved.\n\nThey believe these generic autonomous software agents will solve the problem of chop being too difficult and toilsome. In fact some people claim that agents can take over the task graph entirely, perhaps at least for small businesses, allowing non-technical CEOs to launch apps themselves without having to hire any pesky developers.\n\nI think those people are smoking some serious crack. But many are well-funded, so they’re going to get a chance to give it the old college try, burning investor money like jet fuel along the way. Reminds me of the ride-hailing heyday. How long will the money hold out, I wonder?\n\nPeople have been working in earnest on LLM-backed autonomous agents for at least 18 months, Devin being the poster child rolled out in March to delirious fanfare, and from which we haven’t heard so much as a fart these past eight months. And I’ve heard tell of many more of these general-purpose agents allegedly in development. Somewhere. Supposedly.\n\nHere’s the thing, though: Industry-changing new technologies, the ones that change how we code, always grow the same way: incrementally. They emerge small but capable — just barely good enough to justify using them. And then over time, and many public releases, they grow gradually into behemoths. At least, they do if they’re any good to begin with.\n\nExamples: IDEs, high-level languages, web programming, cloud computing, mobile computing, CI/CD — these and more all grew exactly that way. Even LLMs are the result of thirty-plus years of publicly visible incremental improvements to neural nets.\n\nSo you’d expect all that to be happening for generic autonomous agents. Right?\n\nWell, where is it, then? If I’ve missed something, let me know. But from what I can tell, nobody has launched anything usable yet to start iterating on.\n\nAt this point I suspect the investors who are still in the game are hoping for a big-bang breakthrough that will get it rolling all at once. Because a trickle at this point would be a disaster.\n\nI mean… maybe? It could happen? I’m bearish myself.\n\nBut perhaps there could be some middle ground: something less ambitious than fully general autonomous software agents, but which might still be a big productivity multiplier that can handle much more of the task graph for you than plain old LLM chat. I mean, it’s plausible enough.\n\nOne person with an opinion here that I greatly respect is Idan Gazit, who is Senior Director of Research over at GitHub Next. He gave a fascinating talk at ETLS in Vegas this year. Idan isn’t a huge fan of chop. We had a big heart-to-heart over it and man that guy is cool.\n\nI do empathize with his viewpoint. In essence, he’s an HCI guy at heart, so obviously he doesn’t want Copilot users to be screwing around with task-graph management and context wrangling. So he is looking for an AI modality that every developer can use, one that isn’t biased towards virtuosos.\n\nIdan’s beef with chop, or his chop beef, so to speak, is fair enough: The LLM knows the answer, but it can’t actually do anything except inform you. You might say it’s about as agentic as, well, chopped beef. You, the programmer, must perform all the labor of chopping the context into your chat sessions, and then beefing the answers back into your code base.\n\nSorry, it’s late. This is like slapping both myself and you to keep me awake.\n\nLet’s restart. You, the programmer, must perform all the labor of fetching context and integrating answers. That’s basically it. Chop involves a whole lot of fetching and integrating. Over and over, in a loop. If you are doing chat-first programming, that’s a big part of the job now.\n\nChop’s toil feels an awful lot like it should be handled by your tools; I think everyone can agree on that. With that in mind, Idan is searching for something more powerful than chat, something that any regular programmer today could use without really having to learn too much new stuff.\n\nAnd that’s a big deal. If devs don’t have to learn as much, it would be great news. More programmers will use AI, and more devs will survive the transition to LLMs. I’m a fan. Copilot Workspace is GitHub’s first foray in this ambitious direction. I hope they are successful with it.\n\nIdan rightly observes that everyone will copy whoever stumbles on the magic formula, whatever it winds up being. So we’re all in this together in a sense, trying to figure out what the hell programming will look like tomorrow.\n\nAlthough I am rooting for them, I’m not banking on it myself. I’m assuming it’ll take years to create agents reliable enough to drop into a developer’s workflow and expect them to use it without any training or toil.\n\nIn the meantime, you can actually use chop today, in any coding assistant that supports chat, and get stuff done faster right away. That’s the good news.\n\nThe not so good news is that if you’re impatient, you do have to learn new stuff. Chop’s combination of intrinsic difficulty and newness creates its own knock-on problems. How do we teach it? How do you learn it? How do you interview for it? And of course, where are the metrics?\n\nI’ve been talking to publishers, researchers, industry mavens, you name it. Everyone understands at some level that chat-oriented programming is the next big evolutionary phase for programming. The last one this big was the jump from assembly to high-level languages.\n\nBut nobody knows how to teach chop. There are no resources. It’s day zero. It’s happening before we know exactly how to do it! Sounds a lot like CI/CD back in the day, doesn’t it? Random hodgepodge of best practices told around campfires?\n\nAnd for enterprises, nobody knows how to measure the impact of Code AI, a term which broadly includes all known approaches to using AI for accelerating software development, including chop as a big one.\n\nHow can you justify a big ongoing investment in Code AI for your company if you’re not sure whether it’s working?\n\nAs luck would have it, the legendary Gene Kim and I have been conspiring to brew up some help here. I’ve been working with Gene since we met at ETLS this summer, during which time I have come to admire him greatly. He’s the most unfailingly positive and encouraging person you will ever meet, and his enthusiasm is unfailingly catching and inspiring. Heck, I wouldn’t have got this post published today if Gene hadn’t been texting me PUBLISH IT!! all evening.\n\nBut more to the point, Gene has more than a few superpowers — including the coveted Boundless Energy DLC, which you don’t often find together with the Scarred Wisdom and Infinite Patience powers. Gene has ’em all.\n\nLike me, Gene has also been fascinated with the effect chop is having on both his own productivity, and on the industry in general. To explore the teaching problem, he and I did a Zoom pair programming session that yielded a ton of insights. It’s a pretty deep rabbit-hole if you want to see chop in action. In our session, Gene developed a new superpower using chop, one that makes him the fastest YT video excerpt tweeter on earth. A low-tier power? You betcha.\n\nBut he acquired it in under three hours. Take a look!\n\nAnd to help with the impact measurement problem, Gene aims to do the same thing he did for Code AI that he did with CI/CD: The DORA metrics. Gene was one of the founding fathers of that industry-transforming initiative. And now, his ambition is to do the same for Code AI.\n\nThe idea is to define a set of rigorous industry-standard metrics to help companies know whether they’re doing the right things. These DORA-like metrics will take a group effort. Gene, among his other powers, shares one god-tier superpower with Vint Cerf, co-inventor of the internet, who is the only other person I’ve met with this power. Vint once told me, with great gravity: “My superpower is that I can convene people.” Gene also has a rare talent for gathering and rallying experts. And the team he’s assembling to solve this problem is world-class.\n\nEven Idan’s on it. Naturally. We’re not messing around here.\n\nBut it’s all waaay too much for this post, which has already been growing like a weed. Alas. But one spoiler I’ll offer is that one of the most important metric-related dimensions we’ve unearthed is Optionality. Chop may not necessarily make you a lot faster at stuff you already know how to do well. But it makes you extraordinarily faster at things you’re not very good at — things that you’ve been putting off because you know it’s going to be more work than it’s worth.\n\nChop thus allows you to explore many options in parallel at each stage. For instance, you’re not limited to the programming languages you already know; you can make the LLM do it all in whatever languages you’d like to try out. Same for the database backend, and so on. If the contracts are largely the same, the LLM can quickly create multiple subsystems for that contract which you can compare directly.\n\nThis dramatically increases the scope of what you (and your company) are willing to tackle, which is huge for planning at all levels in the company. And it increases the trustworthiness of the results, because you have tried several options at each critical juncture.\n\nWe think it would be good to quantify and measure all this, and Gene is bringing in the top Optionality experts from other domains to help. Keep your eyes on his Twitter!\n\nSo. That’s my view of the landscape today. I’m not bought into general-purpose autonomous agents. I’m talking to a couple of companies working on *special-*purpose autonomous and semi-autonomous agents, which is an interesting idea. But it’s all early days and unproven. I’m wishing them well and not holding my breath.\n\nI’m not trying to paint a rosy picture. Chop’s adoption will continue to be a bumpy ride for a while. I’ve learned a lot since May about its downsides. It is very different from regular programming, for instance because of hallucinations. People have different levels of tolerance for that level of ambiguity. You would think chop’s learning curve would be shrinking, but it appears to be growing.\n\nIt’s also outside many people’s comfort zone, or their idea of what a programmer’s job should be. You have to commit some serious time in order to switch, and then your job is pretty different. That’s a lot to ask of people.\n\nAnd once you do adopt chop, you’ll find to your disappointment that its benefits are decidedly and uncomfortably nonuniform. Some people will see much larger benefit than others. There is a distinct bias favoring devs with particular skills. And you’ll get different results even from task to task. My buddy Dr. Eric Fritz, who went from skeptic to convert all on his own over the past year, has some funny thoughts on how to characterize these idiosyncrasies. Worth a look, I promise.\n\nBut the bottom line is that chop, although I’m claiming it’s inevitable, is unfortunately nowhere near as linear an accelerator as people might think. Despite its “proven” productivity boosts, chop has also “proven” to be a mean-spirited pain in the ass: unintuitive, uneven, unpredictable. It’s no wonder so many people are hoping it’s just a short transient phase.\n\nMy colleagues and I at Sourcegraph are firmly in the camp that believes that you are the agent who will wrangle the task graph, above the level of the leaf nodes. We believe the wrangler will be human, not a model. We are not sitting around to wait for the research on autonomous agents to conclude, for these all-purpose systems to be built, launched, tested.\n\nScrew that. We just want to give ourselves (and you) the powers you need to make chop go faster.\n\nWhat does that mean in practice? It means two things, and this is true of any coding assistant. First you make the inputs to the LLM faster, by speeding up context fetching and prompt reuse. Then you make processing the outputs faster, e.g. with a smart-apply button.\n\nOf course the LLM’s plan often includes more kinds of integration, like running tools or inspecting logs, and until that integration matures, you handle it with manual toil. But having a coding assistant is a huge speedup. Despite their flaws and gaps, coding assistants can be a better experience than using raw Claude or Gemini/GPT, because they streamline a lot of the work with the LLM inputs and outputs. It all comes down to how well your coding assistant supports chat as a modality.\n\nIt’s safe to say there are oodles, perhaps giga-oodles of coding assistants out there, and as Idan rightly observed, they are converging to an extent by selectively copying one another. It has become like choosing a car, or an airline maybe. They’ve all got roughly the same feature set, but the configurable dials are all turned to different settings.\n\nExamples: Some assistants lock you into a certain model; others give you choices. Some aim for zero-config turn-key bliss, where you don’t have to think about it to use it; others give you more control. Some focus more on individual users; others, mostly on enterprise. Some require you to use their IDE, while others live in your IDE as a plugin.\n\nThese are some pretty fundamental choices that mean a lot to many developers. Depending on your preferences and your company needs, you may find yourself gravitating towards, or being forced to use, a particular coding assistant. Keep in mind that while they may all do roughly the same thing, the way they present that functionality to you can be very different.\n\nBut I think it’s good to have so many options! And competition fosters innovation.\n\nPeople often ask me “What’s one thing Coding Assistant X can do that others cannot?” I don’t think that’s the right question. If you view them more like car models, since they are arguably both as plentiful and as complex, then coding assistants can be as different a Hummer, a Lamborghini, and an e-bike. The right question is, “Which one is best for you?”\n\nThe most important thing to know is that they’re all really frigging cool, and if you use them for chop, you will start flying. Don’t think about code completions anymore. Those are only useful when the LLM isn’t writing your code — which should be exactly never, or at least headed in that direction. To the extent that you can get the LLM to do your work for you, any coding assistant supporting chat conversations will make you a better dev right away. Today.\n\nAnd the converse is also true: If you’re not using chop, then you’re plodding. You’re like one of those crusty old assembly-language holdouts still using asm in 1990 because compiler-generated code wasn’t fast enough. Stubborn bastards, the lot of ’em. Sound familiar?\n\nThey were both right and wrong, since compiler-generated code was indeed not as trustworthy as handwritten code (sound familiar?)… at the time. Once it caught up, their doom was sealed, and their smugness, wiped.\n\nSame will go for you, soon enough, if you find yourself still programming by writing code by hand when the shoe drops.\n\nThis has been a super tough pill for people to swallow. Pharmacists have told me that a lot of patients are confused about their suppository meds and try to eat them. I think that is such a beautiful metaphor here. Chop is unintuitive, biased towards hotshots, nonuniform in its productivity boosts, not yet well-supported by tools, and hard to measure. And you shouldn’t eat it.\n\nThose are indeed tough bananas. But unless you want to gamble everything on autonomous agents magically not sucking in the near term, then you need to get on board with chop immediately. Because there’s a lot to learn, and most of it you need to learn by doing it.\n\nThat’s it for today! If you’re looking for a takeaway, it’s in the title.\n\nMy CTA this time, to bookend the year, is identical to the CTA in May: They had better learn chat-oriented programming, “or else.” Or else… their beef is chopped.

Two weeks later, here is episode #2, with a CEO who still codes every day: Quinn Slack at Sourcegraph.\n\nListen now on Apple, Spotify, and YouTube.\n\nBrought to you by:\n\n• Paragon: ​​Build native, customer-facing SaaS integrations 7x faster.\n\n• Enterprise Ready Conferfence on 30 October: a one-day event in SF for product and engineering leaders shaping the future of enterprise SaaS.\n\nOn today’s episode of The Pragmatic Engineer, I’m joined by Quinn Slack, CEO and co-founder of Sourcegraph, a leading code search and intelligence platform. Quinn holds a degree in Computer Science from Stanford and is deeply passionate about coding: to the point that he still codes every day! He also serves on the board of Hack Club, a national nonprofit dedicated to bringing coding clubs to high schools nationwide. In this insightful conversation, we discuss:\n\nHow Sourcegraph's operations have evolved since 2021\n\nWhy more software engineers should focus on delivering business value\n\nWhy Quinn continues to code every day, even as a CEO\n\nPractical AI and LLM use cases and a phased approach to their adoption\n\nThe story behind Job Fairs at Sourcegraph and why it’s no longer in use\n\nQuinn’s leadership style and his focus on customers and product excellence\n\nThe shift from location-independent pay to zone-based pay at Sourcegraph\n\nAnd much more!\n\nTakeaways\n\nSome of my main takeaways from this conversation are these.\n\n1. As software engineers, it’s increasingly important to understand what value you add to the business. A big difference between 2021 and 2024 is how companies are much more focused on efficiency: meaning they are hiring more conservatively, and less likely to fund teams with headcount that don’t contribute to the core focus of the company.\n\nAs a developer or manager, try to figure out how much your team contributes in revenue, or savings, or other key goals to the company. Are you working in what the company would consider as a profit center, or what is more as a cost center? We did a deepdive on this topic in The Pragmatic Engineer: check out the article, linked in the show notes.\n\n2. AI tools are great to eliminate the toil that we, developers face, day-to-day. There are AI tools that position themselves as their goal being “replacing developers.” I found it sympathetic that Quinn did not think this is the sensible path. His approach is to start by using AI tools with some of the “dumbest things” like generating the changelog for a software release – I mean, assuming you generate a changelog. And then you take tedious tasks where these tools could help, and see if you can automate some more.\n\nDo this one step at a time: and it will actually help devs and teams, and it’s a lot more achievable than saying “let’s replace this whole complicated workflow with AI.”\n\n3. The reality of location independent pay is that it stops being sensible above a certain company size. Sourcegraph was one of the few companies that offered the same base salary regardless of where people worked at. They did this until they grew to about 200 people, and switched this model to a location-indexed model.\n\nQuinn was honest about why they did it: because keeping this would have not made sense for the company, from the business point of view. Basically, location-independent pay means the company can hire very easily in low-cost regions, but it’s hard or impossible to do this in high-cost regions. It also creates the incentive for employees to move to a low cost region where they can save more. In the end, I don’t know of any company with more than 200 people that pays location-independent: all large companies have some kind of indexing on location, and the best companies just pay the top of the local market. We cover more about compensation in the deepdive on The trimodal nature of software engineering salaries.\n\nIf you enjoy the podcast, I’d very much appreciate if you subscribe on your favorite podcast player, and leave a review.

      "# [Sourcegraph automates ‘soul-crushing’ tasks with AI coding agents by Ryan Daws, Hacking & Security on 2025-01-30](https://www.developer-tech.com/news/sourcegraph-automates-soul-crushing-tasks-ai-coding-agents/)\nThe software industry has long grappled with a paradox: the larger the development team and codebase, the slower the rate of progress. However, Sourcegraph believes its AI coding agents will overcome this bottleneck.\n\nBy automating repetitive and tedious coding tasks, Sourcegraph says its AI coding agents will unlock efficiency in enterprise software development while empowering humans to focus on higher-order work.\n\n“This is industrialisation,” the company proclaimed, “breaking a complex process into 100 smaller tasks, then automating the soul-crushing parts and letting humans focus on the ones they’re good at.”\n\nLeave the boring work to AI coding agents\n\nSourcegraph’s new offerings include five AI coding agents starting with the “Code Review Agent,” which is now available via an Early Access Program (EAP) waitlist. This agent functions as a springboard for additional agents – Code Migration, Testing, Documentation, and Notify – that are expected to roll out in the coming months.\n\nKey capabilities include:\n\nCode Review Agent: Already operational in large enterprises and available through EAP, it automates code review processes—offering instant feedback and quality assurance at scale.\n\nAgent API (EAP): A platform to help enterprises build their own custom agents atop Sourcegraph’s infrastructure, also accessible via waitlist.\n\nAuto-edit in the editor: Goes beyond traditional autocomplete by suggesting edits across files, delivering instant code reviews, testing assistance, and documentation feedback.\n\nUnified developer interface: Seamlessly integrates code search, chat, and agents into the broader software development lifecycle tools like editors and code reviews.\n\nUnlike AI copilots that rely on predictive text or agents that claim to outright replace human developers and often miss the mark, Sourcegraph asserts its agents already function in production at some of the biggest enterprises:\n\nIndeed: With over 700 developers, Indeed uses Sourcegraph agents to “catch major bugs, quality concerns, architectural issues, security vulnerabilities, performance problems, and more.\n\nAccording to Jeff Davis, VP of Engineering at Indeed: “Sourcegraph’s agents are a key part of our strategy in multiple stages of the SDLC [Software Development Life Cycle].”\n\nThis automation is predicted to save hundreds of hours on manual reviews and debugging while potentially avoiding costly mistakes.\n\nBooking.com: The world’s largest travel company, with 4,000 developers, is exploring an agent to migrate legacy code. A task anticipated to take over 10 years with human efforts could now shrink to months.\n\n“The agents we’re building with Sourcegraph are helping us reimagine software development,” said Bruno Passos, AI Innovation Lead. “At Booking.com, devs using Sourcegraph daily in the IDE are merging 30%+ more PRs [Pull Requests] every month than those who don’t.”\n\nPriceline: Utilises Sourcegraph agents to triage bugs and alleviate the burden of tracking a vast platform’s moving parts. These agents leverage dispersed repositories of organisational knowledge, including deployment histories and Jira issues, to offer actionable insights to developers.\n\nThe adoption of these agents offers not just tangible benefits, but also demonstrates a broader cultural shift in how companies approach software development amid increasing complexity.\n\n‘Industrialisation’ is the future of coding\n\nThe term “industrialisation” is not merely a marketing buzzword for Sourcegraph—it underpins the company’s philosophy.\n\nRather than aiming to replace human developers entirely, Sourcegraph envisions humans and machines working together harmoniously, akin to the 250-year-long progression of man and machine in traditional manufacturing industries.\n\n“Agents like this – that reliably automate specific tasks – are a transformative technology, and they work today in enterprise codebases,” the company explained. “History shows industrial progress comes from humans and machines working together, not replacing one with the other.”\n\nFar from science fiction scenarios where humanoid robots replace developers outright, the AI agents aim to integrate into existing workflows and reshape the process of “getting work done” at enterprises.\n\nAutomating repetitive duties such as testing, code reviews, and code migrations allows human developers to focus on creative problem-solving, innovation, and complex architectural decisions. Removing the drudgery from software development is likely to be welcomed by everyone.\n\n(Image by Gerd Altmann)\n\nSee also: JetBrains Junie: An AI coding agent to enhance developer productivity\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

      "# [Sourcegraph went dark on 2024-08-19](https://www.eric-fritz.com/articles/sourcegraph-went-dark/)\nTowards the end of my mid-2019 job search, I was down to joining the Google Go team or Sourcegraph. Sourcegraph ultimately won due to cultural factors - the most important of which was the ability to build 100% in the open. All documents were public by default. Technical and product RFCs (and later PR/FAQs) were drafted, reviewed, and catalogued in a public Google Drive folder. All product implementation was done in public GitHub repositories.\n\nToday, the sourcegraph/sourcegraph repository went private. This is the final cleaving blow, following many other smaller chops, on the culture that made Sourcegraph an attractive place to work. It’s a decision for a business from which I resigned, and therefore have no voice. But I still lament the rocky accessibility of artifacts showing four years of genuine effort into a product that I loved (and miss the use of daily in my current role).\n\nOn the bright side, I’ve cemented my place on the insights leaderboard for the remainder of time.\n\nKeeping references alive\n\nOver my tenure at Sourcegraph I’ve done a fair bit of writing for the engineering blog, which I’ve inlined into this website for stable reference. It’s interesting to see what people are trying to build and, for an engineer, how they’re trying to build it. Much of my writing used links into relevant public code as a reference.\n\nAll of these links are now broken.\n\nThere’s a common saying that cool URIs don’t change. In a related sense, I have the hot take that cool articles don’t suddenly start rotting links. I’m going to break at least one of these best practices, and I can’t do anything about the first one. So I’ll attempt to preserve as much information in this writing as possible by moving these links into a repository under my influence.\n\nI'm opting to bite the bullet now and move references to something completely under my control rather than kick then can down the road by referencing another repository that _could_ suddenly disappear at any time.\n\nI had a feeling this would be a risk a while ago, so I had forked sourcegraph/sourcegraph into efritz/sourcegraph in preparation. Given the fork, it should be easy enough job to do a global find-and-replace of one repository name with another at this point and mission accomplished, right?\n\nUnfortunately, no. I had links to code on the main branch, but also links to pull requests and commits within pull requests. Forks don’t inherit pull requests (problem #1). And commits not directly referenced by a branch of your fork are visible as only as long as they’re part of the repository network (problem #2).\n\nI had wondered what happens to forks when a repository is deleted or changes visibility and found some calming information in the official GitHub documentation:\n\nIn other words, a public repository’s forks will remain public in their own separate repository network even after the upstream repository is made private. This allows the fork owners to continue to work and collaborate without interruption. […] If a public repository is made private and then deleted, its public forks will continue to exist in a separate network.\n\nMy fork will continue to exist (yay), but the source repository becoming inaccessible might take commits outside of the main branch with it. I need to ensure that these commits are part of the new repository network.\n\nScraping for relevant commits\n\nStep one is to find all the commits I care about. I ran the following Go program to iterate through all of my pull requests on the source repository and write their payloads to disk for further processing.\n\nThis program yielded 2,645 files with pull request metadata. I then used jq to read these JSON payloads and extract data for subsequent steps.\n\nThis script creates three files:\n\npr_ids.txt is a flat list of GitHub identifiers, which are used in URLs. Since the list endpoint returns only enough data to render a pull request list, we’ll need to fetch additional information (intermediate commits) for each pull request by its ID.\n\ncommits.txt is a flat list of git SHAs that were a result of merging a PR into the target branch (not always main). These commits may or may not be in the forked repository network, depending on the merge target. These should be synced over.\n\nreplace_pairs.txt contains pairs of of pull request identifier and its merge commit. This will later be used to mass replace /pull/{id} with /commit/{sha}. Since pull requests can’t be linked directly anymore, I can at least link to the full pull request contents.\n\nNext, I ran a second program (with the same preamble as the program above) to list all the non-merge commits of each pull request. Based on the pants-on-head way I work, these will mostly be WIP. commits, but sometimes I did a better job and (possibly) linked directly to these.\n\nRunning go run . >> commits.txt dumped these commits onto the end of the file and completes the set of Git SHAs that need to be brought into the repository network for stable reference.\n\nBringing commits into the new repository network\n\nGiven the warning above (“does not belong to any branch on this repository”), it should be sufficient to ensure that my fork has a branch containing each relevant SHA I’d like to retain access to.\n\nBash here does a good enough job since all we’re doing is a bunch of git operations in sequence.\n\nRewriting references\n\nAt this point I should be safe and have some target to link to in my fork for each reference to a pull request or commit in the source repository. Now I just have to figure out how to automate that process (there are at least 275 code references over 15 files and I’m not doing that by hand).\n\nIronically, I used my own thing instead of Cody to figure out how to use xargs correctly for this task.",

    "# Sourcegraph Company and Product Report\n\n## Company Overview\n\n**Sourcegraph** is a software company founded in 2013 by Quinn Slack and Beyang Liu, headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company specializes in code search and intelligence, providing tools that enhance developer productivity through AI-powered coding assistants. As of December 2023, Sourcegraph has approximately 115 employees, a decrease from previous years, reflecting a strategic shift in operations and focus on efficiency [(Tracxn, 2021)](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/sourcegraph/__VKOX0-AKdgV8MrEkAWvpxYcwQPfPjxyEjHJQ8TbiBCU).\n\n### Funding and Valuation\n\nSourcegraph has raised a total of **$223 million** across five funding rounds, with its latest Series D round in July 2021, which valued the company at **$2.6 billion**. Notable investors include Redpoint Ventures, a16z, and Sequoia Capital [(Tracxn, 2021)](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/sourcegraph/__VKOX0-AKdgV8MrEkAWvpxYcwQPfPjxyEjHJQ8TbiBCU). The company has not made any acquisitions to date, focusing instead on organic growth and product development.\n\n### Leadership\n\nQuinn Slack, the CEO, is actively involved in coding and emphasizes the importance of delivering business value through software development. He has expressed a commitment to using AI tools to automate repetitive tasks, allowing developers to focus on more complex problems [(Pragmatic Engineer, 2024)](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/quinn-slack-efficient-scalups).\n\n## Product Overview: Sourcegraph\n\n**Sourcegraph** offers a suite of products designed to improve code search and intelligence, with a particular focus on enhancing developer workflows through AI. The flagship product, **Cody**, is an AI-powered coding assistant that integrates with popular development environments like Visual Studio Code.\n\n### Recent Developments\n\n1. **AI Coding Agents**: In January 2025, Sourcegraph announced the introduction of AI coding agents, including a Code Review Agent, which automates code review processes and provides instant feedback. This initiative aims to streamline the software development lifecycle (SDLC) and improve efficiency in large enterprises [(Hacking & Security, 2025)](https://www.developer-tech.com/news/sourcegraph-automates-soul-crushing-tasks-ai-coding-agents/).\n\n2. **Cody Enhancements**: The Cody tool has been updated to include features like auto-editing, which suggests edits across files and provides instant code reviews and testing assistance. This functionality is designed to enhance the developer experience by reducing manual coding efforts [(Infoworld, 2025)](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3812799/sourcegraph-unveils-ai-coding-agents.html).\n\n3. **Shift to Private Code**: In 2024, Sourcegraph transitioned from an open-source model to a private codebase. This decision was driven by the need to protect proprietary technology and streamline operations, allowing for more significant partnerships and revenue opportunities [(Hacker News, 2024)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41296481).\n\n### Market Position and Competitors\n\nSourcegraph positions itself as a leader in the code intelligence space, competing with established players like GitHub Copilot. The company aims to differentiate itself by focusing on the integration of AI agents that enhance productivity rather than merely providing code completion features [(Hacking & Security, 2025)](https://www.developer-tech.com/news/sourcegraph-automates-soul-crushing-tasks-ai-coding-agents/).\n\n## Employee Insights and Company Culture\n\nSourcegraph has undergone cultural shifts, particularly with its move to private code, which some former employees have criticized as a departure from its original open-source ethos. However, the company continues to emphasize transparency and efficiency in its operations [(Hacker News, 2024)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41296481).\n\n### Employee Count Trends\n\nThe employee count has decreased from previous years, indicating a strategic focus on efficiency and possibly a response to market conditions. As of December 2023, the company employs 115 individuals, down from 140 in 2022 [(Tracxn, 2021)](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/sourcegraph/__VKOX0-AKdgV8MrEkAWvpxYcwQPfPjxyEjHJQ8TbiBCU).\n\n## Future Outlook\n\nSourcegraph is poised for growth as it continues to innovate in the AI coding assistant space. The introduction of AI coding agents and enhancements to Cody are expected to drive adoption among enterprises looking to improve their software development processes. The company’s focus on integrating AI into existing workflows aligns with broader industry trends toward automation and efficiency in software development [(Hacking & Security, 2025)](https://www.developer-tech.com/news/sourcegraph-automates-soul-crushing-tasks-ai-coding-agents/).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSourcegraph represents a significant player in the evolving landscape of software development tools, particularly with its focus on AI-driven solutions. As the demand for automation and efficiency in coding increases, Sourcegraph's innovative products and strategic partnerships position it well for future success. Prospective candidates and investors should consider the company's commitment to enhancing developer productivity and its potential for growth in the AI coding assistant market."
