      "# [Open in Editor](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/integration/open_in_editor)\nWith a click of a button, you can jump from any file in Sourcegraph to your preferred editor. It only takes a minute to set up.\n\nGet started\n\nIf you haven’t used the feature, find the button on the right side of your screen:\n\nWhen you click it, a small popup appears where you’ll need to set two things: a projects path and your editor.\n\nThe projects path is the folder where you store your projects. Enter any Linux, Windows, or macOS absolute path.\n\nExample: If your projects path is /home/username/projects, one of your repos is https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/, and you want to open README in the root folder of the repo, then the feature will look for the file at /home/username/project/sourcegraph/README.\n\nThen choose your preferred editor from the list. We support VS Code, Atom, Sublime Text, and JetBrains IDEs ( AppCode, CLion, GoLand, IntelliJ IDEA, PhpStorm, PyCharm, Rider, RubyMine, WebStorm, and all new IDEs that JetBrains releases). If you use a different editor, check out “Advanced config” below.\n\nOnce you click Save, the icon will you’ll be able to jump to your editor from any file in Sourcegraph.\n\nAdvanced config\n\nIf you want to dig deeper, there are a bunch of optional settings to play with. Click your name at the top-right, select Settings, and add the \"openInEditor\": {} key to your user setting JSON.\n\neditorIds: an array of short names of an editor (“vscode”, “idea”, “sublime”, “pycharm”, etc.) or “custom”. This is what you set in the dropdown when you first set up the feature.\n\nNote that the initial setup UI only allows you to select one editor, but if you use multiple editors, you can manually add more. Each of them will have an icon on your toolbar.\n\ncustom.urlPattern: If you set editorId to “custom” then this must be set, too. Use the placeholders “%file”, “%line”, and “%col” to mark where the file path, line number, and column number must be inserted. Example URL pattern for IntelliJ IDEA: idea://open?file=%file&line=%line&column=%col\n\nprojectPaths.default: This is what you set in the form when you first set up the feature: The absolute path on your computer where your git repositories live. All git repos to open have to be cloned under this path with their original names. /Users/yourusername/src is a valid absolute path, ~/src is not. Works both with and without a trailing slash.\n\nprojectPaths.linux: Overwrites the default path on Linux. Handy if you use different environments. Works both with and without a trailing slash.\n\nprojectPaths.mac: Overwrites the default path on macOS. Works both with and without a trailing slash.\n\nprojectPaths.windows: Overwrites the default path on Windows. Works both with and without a trailing backslash.\n\nreplacements: Key-value pairs. Each key will be replaced by the corresponding value in the final URL. Keys are regular expressions, values can contain backreferences ($1, $2, ...).\n\njetbrains.forceApi: Forces using protocol handlers (like idea://open?file=...) or the built-in REST API (http://localhost:63342/api/file...). If omitted, protocol handlers are used if available, otherwise the built-in REST API is used.\n\nvscode.isProjectPathUNCPath: Indicates that the given projects path is a UNC (Universal Naming Convention) path.\n\nvscode.useInsiders: If set, files will open in VS Code Insiders rather than VS Code.\n\nvscode.useSSH: If set, files will open on a remote server via SSH. This requires vscode.remoteHostForSSH to be specified and VS Code extension “Remote Development by Microsoft” installed in your VS Code.\n\nvscode.remoteHostForSSH: The remote host as USER@HOSTNAME. This needs you to install the extension called “Remote Development by Microsoft” in your VS Code.\n\nJust save your settings and enjoy being totally advanced! 😎\n\nExamples\n\nIntelliJ IDEA on macOS\n\nTo open repository files in your Documents directory:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\": { \"editorIds\": [\"idea\"], \"projectPaths.default\": \"/Users/USERNAME/Documents\" } }\n\nJetBrains IDEs on Windows\n\nNote: We talk about IntelliJ here, but it’s similar for all JetBrains IDEs.\n\nThe idea:// protocol handler does not always work on Windows. If it fails for you, a workaround is to use IntelliJ’s built-in REST API to open files directly from a URL with some extra configuration steps.\n\nAdd this to your Sourcegraph User settings:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\": { ... \"jetbrains.forceApi\": \"builtInServer\" } }\n\nThen open IntelliJ settings, go to Build, Execution, Deployment | Debugger | Built-in Server, and enable Allow unsigned requests. This allows Sourcegraph to make requests to the built-in server, as stated in JetBrains’ docs.\n\nNote: with this workaround, “Open in Editor” will only work if your IDE is running.\n\nVS Code on macOS\n\nTo open repository files in your Documents directory:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\": { \"editorIds\": [\"vscode\"], \"projectPaths.default\": \"/Users/USERNAME/Documents\" } }\n\nVS Code on Windows\n\nTo open repository files in your Documents directory:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\": { \"editorIds\": [\"vscode\"], \"projectPaths.default\": \"C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\Documents\" } }\n\nVS Code on WSL\n\nTo open repository files in your Home directory:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\": { \"editorIds\": [\"vscode\"], \"projectPaths.default\": \"//wsl$/Ubuntu-18.04/home\" } }\n\nVS Code Insider on Mac\n\n{ \"openInEditor\": { ... \"vscode.useInsiders\": true } }\n\nVS Code with different base paths configured for different platforms\n\nUses the assigned path for the detected Operating System when available:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\": { \"editorIds\": [\"vscode\"], // basePath is required as the default path when no Operating System is detected \"projectPaths.default\": \"/Users/USERNAME/Documents/\", \"projectPaths.windows\": \"/C:/Users/USERNAME/folder/\", \"projectPaths.mac\": \"/Users/USERNAME/folder/\", \"projectPaths.linux\": \"/home/USERNAME/folder/\" } }\n\nReplacement Example 1: Open Remote folders with VS Code on Mac by removing file names\n\nThis requires VS Code extension Remote Development by Microsoft to work.\n\nTo open directory where the repository files reside in a remote server:\n\n{ \"openInEditor\": { \"editorIds\": [\"custom\"], \"projectPaths.default\": \"/Users/USERNAME/Documents/\", // Replaces USER@HOSTNAME as appropriate. \"custom.urlPattern\": \"vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+USER@HOSTNAME%file\", //removes file name as the vscode-remote protocol handler only supports directory-opening \"replacements\": { \"\\/[^\\/]*$\": \"\" } } }\n\nReplacement Example 2: Add string to final file path\n\nAdds sourcegraph- in front of the string that matches the (?<=Documents\\/)(.*[\\\\\\/]) RegExp pattern, which is the string after Documents/ and before the final slash.\n\n{ \"openInEditor\": { \"editorIds\": [\"vscode\"], \"projectPaths.default\": \"/Users/USERNAME/Documents/\", \"replacements\": { \"(?<=Documents\\/)(.*[\\\\\\/])\": \"sourcegraph-$1\" } // vscode://file//Users/USERNAME/Documents/REPO-NAME/package.json => vscode://file//Users/USERNAME/Documents/sourcegraph-REPO-NAME/package.json } }\n\nReplacement Example 3: Remove string from the final file path\n\nRemoves sourcegraph- from the final URL.\n\n{ \"openInEditor\": { \"editorIds\": [\"vscode\"], \"projectPaths.default\": \"/Users/USERNAME/Documents/\", \"replacements\": { \"sourcegraph-\": \"\" } // vscode://file//Users/USERNAME/Documents/sourcegraph-REST-OF_REPO-NAME/package.json => vscode://file//Users/USERNAME/Documents/REST-OF_REPO-NAME/package.json } }",

      "# [Phabricator integration with Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/integration/phabricator)\n⚠️ NOTE: Sourcegraph support of Phabricator is limited, and not expected to evolve due to the announced cease of support for Phabricator.\n\nThis Phabricator integration does not support listing and mirroring Phabricator repositories (as it does for repositories on other code hosts). It is intended for use when your repositories are hosted somewhere else (such as GitHub), and Phabricator mirrors repositories from that code host. If your repositories are hosted on Phabricator, you must follow the steps in \"Other Git repository hosts\" to add the repositories so that they are mirrored to Sourcegraph in addition to the steps outlined here to power the integration. Sourcegraph does not currently support using the repository permissions you've set in Phabricator for repositories hosted on Phabricator.\n\nRepository association\n\nSite admins can associate Phabricator repositories with Sourcegraph.\n\nBrowser extension\n\nThe Sourcegraph browser extension supports Phabricator. When installed in your web browser, it adds hover tooltips, go-to-definition, find-references, and code search to files and diffs viewed on Phabricator.\n\nInstall the Sourcegraph browser extension.\n\nConfigure the browser extension to use your Sourcegraph instance.\n\nTo allow the browser extension to work on your Phabricator instance:\n\nNavigate to any page on Phabricator.\n\nRight-click the Sourcegraph icon in the browser extension toolbar.\n\nClick \"Enable Sourcegraph on this domain\".\n\nClick \"Allow\" in the permissions request popup.\n\nVisit any file or diff on Phabricator.

      "# [Sourcegraph docs](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/analytics)\nAnalytics\n\nThe analytics section helps Sourcegraph administrators understand user engagement across the various Sourcegraph features, identify power users, and convey value to internal leaders. Introduced in version 3.42, the section includes analytics breakdowns for our most common features such as Batch Changes, Search Notebooks and search, while also providing basic user-level analytics.\n\nData Visualizations\n\nThe goal of these pages is to help administrators answer any question they might have about how features are being used within their Sourcegraph instance. So far, we have introduced pages for Search, Batch Changes, Code Intel, Search, and Search Notebooks, as well as a general users page.\n\nEach page can visualize the past one week, the past one month, or the path three months of data. For graphs that show user data, the graph can toggle between total users or unique users.\n\nThese graphs pull directly from the event log table within the Sourcegraph instance they are running. There should not be an increase to the storage on disk of these tables due to these new features. Further, no data beyond published ping data is sent back to Sourcegraph.\n\nValue Calculators\n\nEach page also includes a total time saved value which can be used to measure the value Sourcegraph is bringing to your organization. This metric is derived from the configurable calculators below the total time saved value. Each calculator multiplies event log data (ex: number of precise code intel events such as a go-to-definition) by a configurable number of minutes saved per event to arrive at a time saved by the feature.\n\nWe designed this to be configurable by you because we want to...\n\nhelp admins understand the value that is being seen by their organization today.\n\nbe customizable so admins can explore what changes will best increase developer time saved.\n\nThese calculators exist on the Search, Code Intel, Batch Changes, and Notebooks analytics pages. Each calculator looks different as they include metrics specifically designed for that part of the application. Please note that the calculator configuration does not save and will return to the default if you navigate away from the page.\n\nIf you have questions about how this works or about how to convey this value to leaders within your organization, please do not hesitate to reach out to your customer engineer.\n\nFAQ\n\nWho has access to see these improved analytics? Where can I find it?\n\nTo see these new visualizations, you must be a site admin. You can find these under Site Admin section, under the Analytics section of the left-nav bar.\n\nDo these improved analytics require sending data to Sourcegraph?\n\nNo! The processing happens entirely within a your instance so no data is sent in or out of your instance. Further, these improved analytics leverage data already being captured within the event log table of your instance so there is no additional storage or processing required for this change. Basically, customers should notice no perceivable difference to their infrastructure.\n\nHow often is the data updated?\n\nThe data is updated approximately every 24 hours.\n\nHow does this work with the existing usage stats page?\n\nThis new analytics experience has been redesigned from the ground up to provide the most value to administrators. In the future, we plan to deprecate the legacy usage stats page and statistics section once this functionality moved from experimental to generally available.",
      "# [Sourcegraph docs](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/pings)\nPings\n\nSourcegraph periodically sends a ping to pings.sourcegraph.com to help our product and customer teams. It sends only the high-level data below. It never sends code, repository names, usernames, or any other specific data. To learn more, go to the Site admin > Pings page on your instance (the URL is https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/pings).\n\nSourcegraph will also periodically perform a license verification check, to verify the validity of the configured Sourcegraph license. Tampering with these checks, or preventing them from occuring, will cause Sourcegraph to disable many features until a successful check is completed. Certain Enterprise licenses can request to be exempt from these license verification checks.\n\nTelemetry\n\nSourcegraph aggregates usage and performance metrics for some product features in our enterprise deployments.

Below are some debugging steps.\n\nSourcegraph telemetry pings are handled by a goroutine running on Sourcegraphs frontend service called updatecheck, updatecheck is started on container startup and periodically requests a variety of queries be run in the pgsql database.\n\nThe most common scenario in which Sourcegraph stops sending pings is a change to the update.channel setting in an instance's site config\n\n\"update.channel\": \"release\",\n\nThis setting must be set to \"release\" in order for the telemetry goroutine to run.\n\nCheck if the goroutine is running\n\nThis section is under development and currently only applies for docker-compose instances: 39710\n\nIf it's reported that pings aren't being sent to the Sourcegraph.com, you can check that the goroutine is running with the following command:\n\ndocker exec -it sourcegraph-frontend-0 sh -c 'wget -nv -O- 'http://127.0.0.1:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1' | grep updatecheck'\n\nExample:\n\n[ec2-user@latveria-ip ~]$ docker exec -it sourcegraph-frontend-0 sh -c 'wget -nv -O- 'http://127.0.0.1:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1' | grep updatecheck' 2022-04-05 20:53:32 URL:http://127.0.0.1:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1 [14660] -> \"-\" [1] # 0x1f052c5 github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/cmd/frontend/internal/app/updatecheck.Start+0xc5 github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/cmd/frontend/internal/app/updatecheck/client.go:697\n\nLooking for errors in the logs\n\nIf the update.check is running, and the site config is correctly configured, then it may be the case that pgsql is failing to return data from the SQL queries to the frontend. Check out the frontend logs for logs tagged telemetry: updatecheck failed.\n\nIf issues persist, please reach out to a team member for support at [email protected]",
      "# [Sourcegraph docs](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/executors)\nExecutors\n\nExecutors are Sourcegraph's solution for running untrusted code in a secure and controllable way. Executors provide a sandbox that can run resource-intensive or untrusted tasks on behalf of the Sourcegraph instance, such as:\n\nAutomatically indexing a repository for precise code navigation\n\nRunning batch changes\n\nInstallation\n\nTo deploy executors for your Sourcegraph instance, follow our executor deployment guide.\n\nWhy use executors?\n\nRunning untrusted code is a core requirement of features such as precise code navigation auto-indexing, and running batch changes server-side.\n\nAuto-indexing jobs, in particular, require the invocation of arbitrary and untrusted code to support the resolution of project dependencies. Invocation of post-install hooks, use of insecure package management tools, and package manager proxy attacks can create opportunities in which an adversary can gain unlimited use of compute or exfiltrate data. The latter outcome is particularly dangerous for on-premise installations of Sourcegraph, which is the chosen option for companies wanting to maintain strict privacy of their code property.\n\nInstead of performing this work within the Sourcegraph instance, where code is available on disk and unprotected internal services are available over the local network, we move untrusted compute into a sandboxed environment, the executor, that has access only to the clone of a single repository on disk (its workspace) and to the public internet.\n\nSandboxing Model\n\nExecutors can be deployed with Firecracker isolation in accordance with our sandboxing model to isolate jobs from each other and the host. This requires executors to be run on machines capable of running Linux KVM extensions. On the most popular cloud providers, this either means running executors on bare-metal machines (AWS) or machines capable of nested virtualization (GCP).\n\nOptionally, executors can be run without using KVM-based isolation, which is less secure but might be easier to run on common machines.\n\nDeciding which executor deployment method to use\n\nDeciding how to deploy the executor depends on your use case. For users that wish to process their untrusted compute in the most secure manner, we recommend leveraging the Firecracker isolation method. For users that have constraints around running nested virtualization, the following flowchart can help you decide which deployment option is best for your environment:\n\nHow it works\n\nExecutor instances are capable of being deployed in a variety of ways. Each runtime varies in how jobs are executed.\n\nLocally with src-cli\n\nUser runs the src (e.g. src batch) command from the command line.\n\nsrc calls the Sourcegraph API to clone a

      "# [Sourcegraph docs](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/postgres)\nPostgreSQL\n\nSourcegraph uses several PostgreSQL databases to support various functionality. These databases are:\n\npgsql or primary: responsible for user data and account information\n\ncodeintel-db: provides support for lsif data and part of the code-intelligence\n\nVersion requirements\n\nWe support any version starting from 12.\n\nNOTE: ⚠️ Version 3.26 required only Postgres 9.6. You should check the upgrade docs for your deployment type as well as the database upgrade docs below prior to upgrading to 3.27.\n\nRole requirements\n\nThe user provided to Sourcegraph must have full access to the sg database and be able to create the following extensions:\n\nConfiguring PostgreSQL\n\nUpgrading PostgreSQL\n\nSourcegraph uses PostgreSQL as its main database and this documentation describes how to upgrade PostgreSQL between major versions.\n\nWARNING: Upgrading the PostgreSQL database requires stopping your Sourcegraph deployment which will result in downtime.\n\nNOTE: If you running PostgreSQL externally, see Upgrading external PostgreSQL instances\n\nUpgrading external PostgreSQL instances\n\nWhen running an external PostgreSQL instance, please do the following:\n\nBack up the Postgres DB so that you can restore to the old version should anything go wrong.\n\nTurn off Sourcegraph entirely (bring down all containers and pods so they cannot talk to Postgres.)\n\nUpgrade Postgres to the latest version following your provider's instruction or your preferred method:\n\nAWS RDS\n\nAWS Aurora\n\nGCP CloudSQL\n\nAzure DB\n\nHeroku\n\nEnterpriseDB\n\nCitus\n\nAiven PostgreSQL\n\nYour own PostgreSQL\n\nTurn Sourcegraph back on connecting to the now-upgraded database.\n\nWARNING: Do not allow Sourcegraph to run/connect to the new Postgres database until it has been fully populated with your data. Doing so could result in Sourcegraph trying to create e.g. a new DB schema and partially migrating. If this happens to you, restore from the backup you previously took or contact us ([email protected])\n\nUpgrading internal PostgreSQL instances\n\nMany of Sourcegraph's deployment methods come with internal PostgreSQL instances that can be deployed as part of a Sourcegraph installation. This section outlines how to upgrade these databases.\n\nSourcegraph with Docker Compose\n\nGenerally, no additional steps are required to upgrade the databases shipped alongside Sourcegraph with Docker Compose.\n\nSourcegraph with Kubernetes\n\nThe upgrade process is different for Sourcegraph Kubernetes deployments because by default, it uses sourcegraph/postgres-12 which can be customized with environment variables.\n\nIf you have changed PGUSER, PGDATABASE or PGDATA, then the PG*OLD and PG*NEW environment variables are required. Below are the defaults and documentation on what each variable is used for:\n\nPOSTGRES_PASSWORD='': Password of PGUSERNEW if it is newly created (i.e when PGUSERNEW didn't exist in the old database).\n\nPGUSEROLD=sg: A user that exists in the old database that can be used to authenticate intermediate upgrade operations.\n\nPGUSERNEW=sg: A user that must exist in the new database after the upgrade is done (i.e. it'll be created if it didn't exist already).\n\nPGDATABASEOLD=sg: A database that exists in the old database that can be used to authenticate intermediate upgrade operations. (e.g psql -d)\n\nPGDATABASENEW=sg: A database that must exist in the new database after the upgrade is done (i.e. it'll be created if it didn't exist already).\n\nPGDATAOLD=/data/pgdata-11: The data directory containing the files of the old PostgreSQL database to be upgraded.\n\nPGDATANEW=/data/pgdata-12: The data directory containing the upgraded PostgreSQL data files, used by the new version of PostgreSQL.\n\nAdditionally, the upgrade process assumes it can write to the parent directory of PGDATAOLD.\n\nRequirements for upgrading from Postgres 11 to 12 for Kubernetes\n\nThis guide is for the Sourcegraph 3.27 release. The migration to Postgres 12 using the Sourcegraph provided Postgres images is largely automated. However, you should take some steps before the migration. For the 3.27 release, these apply to the pgsql & codeintel-db deployments.\n\nInform your users prior to starting the upgrade that Sourcegraph will take downtime. This downtime scales with the size and resources allocated to the Postgres database instances.\n\nTake snapshots of all Sourcegraph Postgres databases. You can find the backing disk in your cloud by describing the relevant PersistentVolumes.\n\nEnsure that the size of the disks backing the databases are under 50% utilization. (You will need up-to 2x the size of your current database to do the migration). In most cases Kubernetes can expand the size of the volume for you, see the relevant kubernetes docs here.\n\nYou can use kubectl exec -it $DB_POD_NAME -- df -h. By default, the database will be mounted under /data/.\n\nSingle-container Sourcegraph\n\nWhen running a new version of Sourcegraph, single-container Sourcegraph with Docker instances will check if the PostgreSQL data needs upgrading upon initialization.\n\nSee the following steps to upgrade between major postgresql versions:\n\n1. Stop the sourcegraph/server container.\n\n2. Save this script and give it executable permissions (chmod + x).\n\nNOTE: The script presumes your data is being upgraded from 11 to 12 and your Sourcegraph directory is at ~/.sourcegraph/. Change the values in the code below if that's not the case.\n\n3. Execute the script.",
      "# [Administration FAQ](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/faq)\nHow does Sourcegraph store repositories on disk?\n\nSourcegraph stores bare Git repositories (without a working tree), which is a complete mirror of the repository on your code host.\n\nIf you are keen for more details on what bare Git repositories are, check out this discussion on StackOverflow.\n\nThe directories should contain just a few files and directories, namely: HEAD, config, description, hooks, info, objects, packed-refs, refs\n\nDoes Sourcegraph support svn?\n\nFor Subversion and other non-Git code hosts, the recommended way to make these accessible in Sourcegraph is through src-expose.\n\nAlternatively, you can use git-svn or svg2git to convert Subversion repositories to Git repositories. Unlike src-expose, this will preserve commit history, but is generally much slower.\n\nHow do I access Sourcegraph if my authentication provider experiences an outage?\n\nIf you are using an external authentication provider and the provider experiences an outage, users will be unable to sign into Sourcegraph. A site administrator can configure an alternate sign-in method by modifying the auth.providers field in site configuration. However, the site administrator may themselves be unable to sign in. If this is the case, then a site administrator can update the configuration if they have direct docker exec or kubectl exec access to the Sourcegraph instance. Follow the instructions to update the site config if the web UI is inaccessible.\n\nHow do I set up redirect URLs in Sourcegraph?\n\nSometimes URLs in Sourcegraph may change. For example, if a code host configuration is updated to use a different repositoryPathPattern, this will change the repository URLs on Sourcegraph. Users may wish to preserve links to the old URLs, and this requires adding redirects.\n\nWe recommend configuring redirects in a reverse proxy. If you are running Sourcegraph as a single Docker image, you can deploy a reverse proxy such as Caddy or NGINX in front of it. Refer to the Caddy or NGINX documentation for URL rewrites.\n\nIf you are running Sourcegraph as a Kubernetes cluster, you have two additional options:\n\nIf you are using NGINX ingress (kubectl get ingress | grep sourcegraph-frontend), modify sourcegraph-frontend.Ingress.yaml by adding a rewrite rule.\n\nWhat external HTTP checks are configured?\n\nWe leave the choice of which external HTTP check monitor up to our users. What we provide out-of-the-box is extensive metrics monitoring through Prometheus and Grafana, with builtin alert thresholds and dashboards, and Kubernetes/Docker HTTP health checks which verify that the server is running. Sourcegraph's frontend has a default health check at https://$SOURCEGRAPH_BASE_URL/healthz. Some users choose to set up their own external HTTP health checker which tests if the homepage loads, a repository page loads, and if a search GraphQL request returns successfully.\n\nMonitoring\n\nPlease visit our Observability Docs for more in-depth information about observability in Sourcegraph.\n\nWhat should I look at when my instance is having performance issues?\n\nSourcegraph comes with built-in monitoring in the form of Grafana, connected to Prometheus for metrics and alerting.\n\nGenerally, Grafana should be the first stop you make when experiencing a system performance issue. From there you can look for system alerts or metrics that would provide you with more insights on what’s causing the performance issue. You can learn more about accessing Grafana here.\n\nWhat are the key values/alerts to look for when looking at the Grafana Dashboard?\n\nPlease refer to the Dashboards guide for more on how to use our Grafana dashboards.\n\nPlease refer to Understanding alerts for examples and suggested actions for alerts.\n\nHow do I know when more resources are needed for a specified service?\n\nAll resource dashboards contain a section called Provisioning indicators that provide information about the current resource usage of containers. These can be used to determine if a scale-up is needed (example panel).\n\nMore information on each available panel in the dashboards is available in the Dashboards reference.\n\nWhat does this <ALERT-MESSAGE> mean?\n\nSee Alert solutions to learn about each alert and their possible solutions.\n\nWhat’s the threshold for each resource?\n\nAll resources dashboards contain a section called Container monitoring that indicate thresholds at which alerts will fire for each resource (example alert).\n\nMore information on each available panel in the dashboards is available in the Dashboards reference.\n\nHow much resources should I add after receiving alerts about running out of resources?\n\nYou should make the decision based on the metrics from the relevant Grafana dashboard linked in each alert.\n\nWhat are some of the important alerts that I should be aware of?\n\nWe recommend paying closer attention to critical alerts.\n\nHow do I set up alerts?\n\nPlease refer to our guide on setting up alerting.\n\nHow do I create a custom alert?\n\nCreating a custom alert is not recommended and currently not supported by Sourcegraph. However, please provide feedback on the monitoring dashboards and alerts if you find anything could be improved via our issue tracker.\n\nMore advanced users can also refer to our FAQ item about custom consumption of Sourcegraph metrics.\n\nCan I consume Sourcegraph's metrics in my own monitoring system (Datadog, New Relic, etc.)?\n\nSourcegraph provides high-level alerting metrics which you can integrate into your own monitoring system—see the alerting custom consumption guide for more details.\n\nWhile it is technically possible to consume all of Sourcegraph's metrics in an external system, our recommendation is to utilize the builtin monitoring tools and configure Sourcegraph to send alerts to your own PagerDuty, Slack, email, etc.. Metrics and thresholds can change with each release, therefore manually defining the alerts required to monitor Sourcegraph's health is not recommended. Sourcegraph automatically updates the dashboards and alerts on each release to ensure the displayed information is up-to-date.\n\nOther monitoring systems that support Prometheus scraping (for example, Datadog and New Relic) or Prometheus federation can be configured to federate Sourcegraph's high-level alerting metrics. For information on how to configure those systems, please check your provider's documentation.\n\nI am getting \"Error: Cluster information not available\" in the Instrumentation page, what should I do?\n\nThis error is expected if your instance was not deployed with Kubernetes.

      "# [Troubleshooting guide](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/observability/troubleshooting)\nThis is a guide for investigating errors and performance issues, with the goal of resolving the issue or generating a high-quality issue report.\n\nHow to use this guide:\n\nScan through Specific scenarios to see if any of these applies to you. If any do, follow the instructions in the subsection.\n\nScan through General scenarios to find which scenario(s) applies to you. If any do, follow the instructions to update your instance or collect information for the issue report.\n\nIf you cannot resolve the issue on your own, file an issue on the Sourcegraph issue tracker with the collected information. Enterprise customers may alternatively file a support ticket or email [email protected].\n\nNOTE: This guide assumes you have site admin privileges on the Sourcegraph instance. If you are non-admin user, report your error the site admin and have them walk through this guide.\n\nSpecific scenarios\n\nScenario: search and code pages take a long time to load\n\nIf this is the case, this could indicate high gitserver load. To confirm, take the following steps:\n\nOpen Grafana.\n\nIf using Sourcegraph 3.14: Simply check if either of these alerts are firing:\n\ngitserver: 50+ concurrent command executions (abnormally high load)\n\ngitserver: echo command execution duration exceeding 1s\n\nIf using an older version of Sourcegraph:\n\nGo to the Sourcegraph Internal > Gitserver rev2 dashboard.\n\nExamine the \"Echo Duration Seconds\" dashboard (tracks the src_gitserver_echo_duration_seconds metric) and \"Commands running concurrently\" dashboard (tracks the src_gitserver_exec_running metric). If either of these is high (> 1s echo duration or 100s simultaneous execs), then this indicates gitserver is under heavy load and likely the bottleneck.\n\nConfirm your gitserver is not under-provisioned, by e.g. comparing its allocated resources with what the resource estimator shows.\n\nSolution: set USE_ENHANCED_LANGUAGE_DETECTION=false in the Sourcegraph runtime environment.\n\nScenario: no cloning, syncing, updating or deleting is happening\n\nObserved state: Sourcegraph instance does not react to any updates to code hosts and no cloning is happening. The cause of this state could be repo-updater queries that are too large for the limits of the running Postgres DB. One symptom is seeing a line like the one below in the repo-updater logs:\n\nt=2020-05-28T18:41:02+0000 lvl=eror msg=Syncer error=\"syncer.sync.store.upsert-repos: delete: driver: bad connection\n\nor seeing the same error in the \"Code host status panel\" (Clicking the cloud icon).\n\nThe fix is to increase the memory on Postgres DB which will increase certain Postgres-internal limits and will allow the queries from repo-updater to go through.\n\nAnother cause could be that the repo-updater is in a crash loop for some reason. If there are large numbers of repos to be updated it could be from Out of memory errors. A fix here is to increase the memory for repo-updater instead.\n\nGeneral scenarios\n\nThis section contains a list of scenarios, each of which contains instructions that include actions that are appropriate to the scenario. Note that more than one scenario may apply to a given issue.\n\nScenario: the issue is NOT performance-related and there is a consistent reproduction.\n\nRecord the following information in the issue report:\n\nReproduction steps\n\nA screenshot of the error page or error message\n\nThe output of the browser developer console\n\nLog output while reproducing the issue\n\nSourcegraph configuration\n\nWhen was the most recent update or deployment change applied?\n\nScenario: the issue is NOT performance-related, but it is hard to reproduce.\n\nWithout a consistent reproduction, the issue will be harder to diagnose, so we recommend trying to find a repro if possible. If that isn't possible, file an issue with the following information:\n\nSteps the user took before encountering the issue, including as much detail as possible.\n\nBad example: \"User encountered a 502 error when trying to search for something.\"\n\nGood example: \"User encountered a 502 error on the search results page when trying to conduct a global search for the following query. On refresh, the search worked with no error. The desired result appears in our main repository, which is rather large (takes about a minute to fully clone). The issue doesn't reproduce consistently, but we saw two other reports like this around 2pm PT yesterday, during peak usage hours.\"\n\nExamine the error rates for any anomalies.\n\nIf you know the approximate time the issue occurred or if there is a spike in error rate around a certain time, copy the logs around that time.\n\nNote any pattern in the issue reports. E.g., did users encountering the issue all visit the same repository or belong to the same organization. Do site admins encounter the issue or only non-admin users?\n\nSourcegraph configuration\n\nWhen was the most recent update or deployment change applied?\n\nScenario: the issue is performance-related and there is a consistent reproduction\n\nInclude the reproduction steps in the error report, along with relevant context (e.g., repository size).\n\nBad example: \"User did a search and it timed out.\"\n\nGood example: \"User issued the following search query in the following repository. The repository is one of our larger repositories (takes about 1 minute to fully clone and the size of the .git directory is 5GB). The results page took about 60 seconds to load and when it finally did, the results was an error message that said 'timeout'\".\n\nOpen the browser developer network panel and identify slow requests.\n\nUse Jaeger to drill down into slow requests and understand which components of the request are slow. Remember that many Sourcegraph API requests identify the Jaeger trace ID in the x-trace HTTP response header, which makes it easy to look up the trace corresponding to a particular request.\n\nIf Jaeger is unavailable or unreliable, you can collect trace data from the Go net/trace endpoint.\n\nCopy the Sourcegraph configuration to the error report.\n\nScenario: the issue is performance-related and there is NOT a consistent reproduction\n\nWithout a consistent reproduction, the issue will be harder to diagnose, so we recommend trying to find a repro if possible. If that isn't possible, try the following:\n\nExamine resource usage, usage stats, and error rates over time in Grafana and Prometheus.\n\nAre there spikes in latencies or error rate over time?\n\nAre there spikes in usage or traffic over time that correlate with when the issue is reported.\n\nAre there spikes in memory usage, CPU, or disk usage over time?\n\nIf you know the approximate time the issue occurred or if there is a suspicious spike in metrics around a certain time, check the logs around that time.\n\nIf the issue is ongoing or if you know the time during which the issue occurred, search Jaeger for long-running request traces in the appropriate time window.\n\nIf Jaeger is unavailable, you can alternatively use the Go net/trace endpoint. (You will have to scan the traces for each service to look for slow traces.)\n\nIf tracing points to a specific service as the source of high latency, examine the logs and net/trace info for that service.\n\nScenario: multiple actions are slow or Sourcegraph as a whole feels sluggish\n\nIf Sourcegraph feels sluggish overall, the likely culprit is resource allocation.\n\nNOTE: some of these recommendations involve increasing the replica or shard count of individual services. This is only possible when Sourcegraph is deployed into a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nExamine memory, CPU, and disk usage metrics.\n\nIf the metrics indicate high resource consumption, adjust the resource allocation higher.\n\nIf metrics are unavailable or inaccessible, here is a rough correspondence between end-user slowness and the services that are usually the culprit:\n\nGlobal search (i.e., no repository scope is specified) results page takes a long time to load.\n\nIncrease indexed-search memory limit or CPU limit. The number of indexed-search shards can also be increased if using Sourcegraph on Kubernetes.\n\nSearch results show up quickly, but code snippets take awhile to populate. File contents take awhile to load.\n\nIncrease gitserver memory usage. Gitserver memory may be the bottleneck, especially if there are many repositories or repositories are large.\n\nIncrease number of gitserver shards. This can help if memory is the bottleneck. It can also help if there are too many repositories per shard. Gitserver \"shells out\" to git for every repository data request, so a high volume of user traffic that generates many simultaneous requests for many repositories can lead to a spike in Linux process exec latency.\n\nIncrease memory and CPU limit of syntect-server. This helps if syntax highlighting is the bottleneck.\n\nMultiple UI pages take awhile to load.\n\nIncrease frontend CPU and memory limit.\n\nSearches show intermittent HTTP 502 errors or timeouts, possibly concurrent with frontend container restarts.\n\nIncrease frontend memory and CPU. This may indicate the frontend is running out of memory when loading search results. This can be a problem when dealing with large monorepos.\n\nIf it is unclear which service is underallocated, examine Jaeger to identify long-running traces and see which services take up the most time.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the Go net/trace endpoint to pull trace data.\n\nScenario: Prometheus scraping metrics outside Sourcegraph Kubernetes namespace\n\nIf you are seeing cAdvisor metrics from a namespace outside of the one Sourcegraph is currently deployed into.\n\nUncomment our namespaced Prometheus cAdvisor configuration\n\nApply this configuration and restart Prometheus\n\nNote: This is unneeded if you are using the 'namespaced' overlay\n\nScenario: search timeouts\n\nIf your users are experiencing search timeouts or search performance issues, please perform the following steps:\n\nTry appending variations of index:only, timeout:60s and count:999999 to the search query to see if it is still slow.\n\nAccess Grafana directly.\n\nSelect the + icon on the left-hand side, then choose Import.\n\nPaste this JSON into the input and click Load.\n\nOnce the dashboard appears, include screenshots of the entire dashboard in the issue report.\n\nInclude the logs of zoekt-webserver container in the indexed-search pods. If you are using single Docker container enable debug logs first.\n\nScenario: zoekt-webserver is in a CrashloopBackOff and err cannot allocate memory\n\nSourcegraph uses a mmap to store its indices. The default operating system limits on mmap counts may to be too low, which may result in out of memory exceptions. If you are seeing this error on large scale deployments with a lot repos to be indexed, please use the following steps to verify the source of the errors:\n\nEnsure pods are not actually running out of allocated memory and being OOMKilled by running (if they are, then you should give them more memory and the below will not help you):\n\nkubectl top pod indexed-search-<pod_number> kubectl describe nodes\n\nOn the host operating system execute sudo sysctl -n vm.max_map_count.\n\n$ sysctl -n vm.max_map_count 65530\n\nCalculate the number of repos in your deployment divided by the number of indexed-search replicas. For example:\n\n250,000 repositories / 2 indexed-search repliacas = 125,000 repos to index per replica.\n\nIf the vm.max_map_count is lower than the result of the above calculation. Adjust the vm.max_map_count by executing:\n\nsudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144\n\nVerify the change.\n\n$ sudo sysctl -n vm.max_map_count 262144\n\nEnsure the change will persist a system reboot by updating the vm.max_map_count setting in /etc/sysctl.conf.\n\nScenario: zoekt-webserver is restarting due to watchdog\n\nzoekt-webserver has a built in watchdog which ensures it can respond to search requests. If the watchdog fails, it will panic causing the process to exit with a non-zero exit code. This is like a Kubernetes health check, but works across all our deployment environments.\n\nBy default the watchdog runs every 30s. If the watchdog fails 3 consecutive times (with a 30s sleep in-between) it will trigger the panic. This is usually indicative a server which is consistently overloaded. It is recommended to increase the CPU quota assigned to it or horizontally scale to more replicas.\n\nFrom Sourcegraph 3.22 you can configure the watchdog via environment variables:\n\nZOEKT_WATCHDOG_TICK :: Duration of how often it runs. (default 30s)\n\nZOEKT_WATCHDOG_ERRORS :: Consecutive error count before exit. (default 3)\n\nIf either is 0 the watchdog is disabled.\n\nYou can further diagnose an overloaded zoekt-webserver via watchdog logs or metrics. See log messages mentioning watchdog, or view the following metrics in grafana:\n\nzoekt_webserver_watchdog_errors :: The current error count for zoekt watchdog.\n\nzoekt_webserver_watchdog_total :: The total number of requests done by zoekt watchdog.\n\nzoekt_webserver_watchdog_errors_total :: The total number of errors from zoekt watchdog.\n\nActions\n\nThis section contains various actions that can be taken to collect information or update Sourcegraph in order to resolve an error or performance issue. You should typically not read this section directly, but start with the General scenarios section to determine which actions are appropriate.\n\nCheck browser console\n\nOpen the browser JavaScript console (right-click in the browser > Inspect to open developer tools, then click the Console tab).\n\nCheck browser network panel\n\nOpen the browser developer network page (right-click in the browser > Inspect to open developer tools, then click the Network tab).\n\nIf you are new to the network page, check out this great introduction to the Chrome developer tools Network panel.\n\nCheck the waterfall diagram at the top and the Waterfall column in the list of network requests to quickly identify high-latency requests.\n\nClicking on a request will open up a panel that provides additional details about the request.\n\nIf a GraphQL request is taking a long time, you should obtain its Jaeger trace ID by inspecting the Headers tab of this panel and finding the X-Trace or x-trace response header value. Once you've obtained this trace ID, look it up in Jaeger.\n\nYou can check Preserve log to preserve the list of requests across page loads and reloads.\n\nCheck resource usage\n\nAccess Prometheus and examine the following metrics:\n\nMemory: process_resident_memory_bytes is a gauge that tracks memory usage per backend process.\n\nExample: process_resident_memory_bytes{app=\"indexed-search\"} shows memory usage for each indexed-search instance.\n\nCPU: process_cpu_seconds_total is a counter that tracks cumulative CPU seconds used .\n\nExample: rate(process_cpu_seconds_total{app=\"sourcegraph-frontend\"}[1m]) shows average CPU usage for each sourcegraph-frontend instance over the last minute.\n\nDisk: gitserver_disk_free_percent is a gauge that tracks free disk space on gitserver.\n\nCheck end-user stats\n\nGo to /site-admin/usage-statistics to view daily, weekly, and monthly user statistics.\n\nTo drill down (e.g., into sub-daily traffic, visits per page type, latencies, etc.), access Grafana and visit the Sourcegraph Internal > HTTP dashboard page, which includes the following panels:\n\nQPS by Status Code\n\nQPS by URL Route\n\nP90 Request Duration (request latency at the 90th percentile)\n\nGrafana contains ready-made dashboards derived from Prometheus metrics. Any chart in Grafana mentioned here can be viewed in Prometheus by clicking the dropdown menu next to the Grafana panel title > Edit > copying the expression in the Metrics field.\n\nCheck error rates\n\nAccess Grafana and view the following charts:\n\nFolder: Sourcegraph Internal > Dashboard: HTTP > Chart: QPS by Status Code\n\nThis shows request rates by HTTP status code for end-user requests.\n\nFolder: General\n\nThis contains dashboards for each core service in Sourcegraph. Examine each for high-level metrics important to the health of each service.\n\nCollect a Jaeger trace\n\nIf you are looking for the trace associated with a specific request,\n\nFind the trace ID in the HTTP response in the browser developer tools \"Network\" tab.\n\nAccess Jaeger and look up the trace ID.\n\nIf you do not have a specific request or cannot find the trace ID,\n\nAccess Jaeger.\n\nSearch for a matching span by setting the appropriate fields in the sidebar.\n\n2 ways: start with a span ID, or manually locate your span by searching the Jaeger GUI\n\nExamine logs\n\nIf you are using the single Docker container or Docker Compose deployment option, logs are printed to stdout and stderr. You should be able to access these using your infrastructure provider's standard log viewing mechanism.\n\nIf you are using Kubernetes,\n\nRetrieve logs with kubectl logs $POD_ID.\n\nTail logs with kubectl logs -f $POD_ID.\n\nIf a pod container died, you can access the previous container logs with kubectl logs -p $POD_ID. This can be useful for diagnosing why a container crashed.\n\nYou can tail logs for all pods associated with a given deployment: kubectl logs -f deployment/sourcegraph-frontend --container=frontend --since=10m\n\nExamine Go net/trace\n\nEach core service has an endpoint which displays traces using Go's net/trace package.\n\nTo access this data,\n\nFirst ensure you are logged in as a site admin.\n\nGo to the URL path /-/debug. This page should show a list of links with the names of each core service (e.g., frontend, gitserver, etc.)\n\nClick on the service you'd like to examine.\n\nClick \"Requests`. This brings you to a page where you can view traces for that service.\n\nYou can filter to traces by duration or error state.\n\nYou can show histograms of durations by minute, hour, or in total (since the process started)\n\nOn older versions of Sourcegraph on Kubernetes, the /-/debug URL path may be inaccessible. If this is the case, you'll need to forward port 6060 on the main container of a given pod to access its traces. For example, to access to traces of the first gitserver shard,\n\nkubectl port-forward gitserver-0 6060\n\nGo to http://localhost:6060 in your browser, and click on \"Requests\".\n\nCopy configuration\n\nGo the the URL path /site-admin/report-bug to obtain an all-in-one text box of all Sourcegraph configuration (which includes site configuration, code host configuration, and global settings). This lets you easily copy all configuration to an issue report (NOTE: remember to redact any secrets).\n\nCollect instance stats\n\nThe following statistics are useful background context when reporting a performance issue:\n\nNumber of repositories (can be found on the /site-admin/repositories page, search for \"repositories total\")\n\nSize distribution of repositories (e.g., are there one or more large \"monorepos\" that contain most of the code?)\n\nNumber of users and daily usage stats from /site-admin/usage-statistics",

      "# [Common reasons code insights may not match search results](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/code_insights/references/common_reasons_code_insights_may_not_match_search_results)\nThere are a few reasons why chart data series' most recent datapoint may show you a different number of match counts than the same search query run in Sourcegraph manually.\n\nIf the chart data point shows higher counts than a manual search\n\n[For versions pre-3.40] Not including fork:no and archived:no in your insight query\n\nBecause code insights historical search defaults to fork:yes and archived:yes, but a Sourcegraph search via the web interface or CLI does not, it may be that your insight data series is including results from repositories that are excluded from a Sourcegraph search. Try running the same search again manually with fork:yes and archived:yes filters.\n\nNOTE: 3.40+ version defaults to fork:no and archived:no, the same way the search UI does.\n\nManual search will not include unindexed repositories\n\nAll repositories in a historical search are unindexed, but a manual Sourcegraph search only includes indexed repositories. It's possible your manual searches are missing results from unindexed repositories.\n\nTo investigate this, one can compare the list of repositories in the manual search (use a select:repository filter) with the list of repositories in the insight series_points database table. To see why a repository may not be indexing, refer to this guide.\n\nIf the chart data point shows lower counts than a manual search\n\nNew matches created since the insight datapoint ran\n\nCurrently, a data series' most recent datapoint defaults to the end of the prior month. It's possible that in the time between when your insight ran and when you ran a manual search, new matches have been added to your codebase. To confirm this, you can run type:diff or type:commit searches using the after: filter, but note that those filters only support up to 10,000 repositories, so you may first need to limit your search repository set.\n\nNOTE: Future releases of Code Insights may include an always-up-to-date present-time point.\n\nRepository timeouts caused a datapoint to miss results\n\nIf your code insight is very large, it is possible that a few (<1% in 100+ manual tests over 26,000 repositories) repositories failed to return match counts due to timing out while searching. To check this, you can run the following GraphQL query in the Sourcegraph GraphQL API:\n\nwhere INSIGHT_ID can be found in the \"edit\" page for the insight (selectable from the three-dot dropdown on the insight) after ...edit/. It will look like https://yourdomain.sourcegraph.com/insights/edit/INSIGHT_ID?dashboardId=all. The INSIGHT_ID can also be found in the url of the single insight view found by clicking on the title of the insight. The ID will be in the url, for example, https://sourcegraph.yourdomain.com/insights/insight/{INSIGHT_ID}",

      "# [Metrics and dashboards](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/observability/metrics)\nSourcegraph ships with Grafana for dashboards, Prometheus for metrics and alerting. We also provide built-in alerting for these metrics.\n\nGrafana\n\nSite admins can view the Grafana monitoring dashboards on a Sourcegraph instance:\n\nGo to User menu > Site admin.\n\nOpen the Monitoring page from the link in the left sidebar. The URL is https://sourcegraph.example.com/-/debug/grafana/.\n\nDashboards\n\nA complete dashboard reference is available for more context on our available service dashboards and panels.\n\nAdditional dashboards can also be set up—see Grafana configuration for more details.\n\nView documentation\n\nOn service dashboards, each metric panel has links attached that lead to relevant alert solutions or panel documentation. These can be accessed from the top left corner of each panel.\n\nView alerts\n\nThe Overview dashboard includes a high-level summary of alert events across all Sourcegraph services.\n\nOn service dashboards, a summary of alert events for that service is available. Alerts can be filtered by level using the \"Filter alert level\" selector at the top of the dashboard. This information can be overlaid on all panels in that dashboard by enabling the \"Alert events\" toggle.\n\nView version change events\n\nOn service dashboards, annotations can be displayed for occasions when a Sourcegraph version change is detected by enabling the \"Version changes\" toggle at the top of the dashboard. This can be useful for correlating metrics and alerts with Sourcegraph deployment and upgrade events.\n\nQuerying metrics\n\nSpecific metrics can be queried using Grafana's Explore panel, available at /-/debug/grafana/explore on your Sourcegraph instance. The query for each individual panel can be viewed and explored by clicking on the panel and using the \"Explore\" option.\n\nGrafana configuration\n\nSourcegraph deploys a customized image of Grafana, which ships with Sourcegraph-specific dashboard definitions.\n\nTo provide custom dashboards, a directory containing dashboard JSON specifications can be mounted in the Docker container at /sg_grafana_additional_dashboards. Changes to files in that directory will be detected automatically while Grafana is running.\n\nMore behavior can be controlled with environmental variables.\n\nNOTE: There is a known issue where attempting to edit anything using the Grafana UI will result in a 403 response with \"invalid CSRF token\". As a workaround, site admins can connect to Grafana directly to make changes using the Grafana UI.\n\nAccessing Grafana directly\n\nFor most use cases, you can access Grafana through your Sourcegraph instance. Follow the instructions below to access Grafana directly to, for example, edit configuration directly.\n\nNOTE: Most of the dashboards that Sourcegraph ships with are not configurable through the Grafana UI. In general, we recommend these configuration methods instead.\n\nIf you are using the Kubernetes deployment option, you can access Grafana directly using Kubernetes port forwarding to your local machine:\n\nGrafana will be available http://localhost:3370/-/debug/grafana.\n\nIf you are using Docker Single Container or the Docker Compose deployment option, Grafana is available locally at http://localhost:3370/-/debug/grafana without any additional setup. If Sourcegraph is deployed to a remote server, then access via an SSH tunnel using a tool such as sshuttle is required to establish a secure connection to Grafana. To access the remote server using sshuttle from your local machine:\n\nGrafana will be available at http://host:3370/-/debug/grafana.\n\nWARNING: Our Grafana instance runs in anonymous mode with all authentication turned off, since we rely on Sourcegraph's built-in authentication. Please be careful when exposing it directly to external traffic.\n\nPrometheus\n\nPrometheus is a monitoring tool that collects application- and system-level metrics over time and makes these accessible through a robust query language.\n\nFor most use cases, you can query Prometheus through Grafana using Grafana's Explore panel, available at /-/debug/grafana/explore on your Sourcegraph instance, or simply rely on the dashboards we ship.\n\nAvailable metrics\n\nHigh-level alerting metrics\n\nSourcegraph's metrics include a single high-level metric alert_count which indicates the number of level=critical and level=warning alerts each service has fired over time for each Sourcegraph service. This is the same metric presented on the Overview Grafana dashboard.\n\nNOTE: We provide built-in alerting for these alerting metrics to help monitor the health of your Sourcegraph instance. Refer to our alert solutions reference for details on specific alerts.\n\nDescription: The number of alerts each service has fired for a given alert name and severity level.\n\nValues: Although the values of alert_count are floating-point numbers, only their whole numbers have meaning. For example, 0.5 and 0.7 indicate no alerts are firing, while 1.2 indicates exactly one alert is firing and 3.0 indicates exactly three alerts firing.\n\nLabels:\n\nComplete reference\n\nA complete reference of Sourcegraph's vast set of Prometheus metrics is not yet available. If you are interested in this, please reach out by filing an issue or contacting us at [email protected].\n\nPrometheus configuration\n\nSourcegraph runs a customized image of Prometheus, which packages a standard Prometheus installation together with rules files and target files tailored to Sourcegraph and quality-of-life integrations such as the ability to configure alerting from the Sourcegraph web application.\n\nA directory can be mounted at /sg_prometheus_add_ons. It can contain additional config files of two types:\n\nrule files which must have the suffix _rules.yml in their filename (ie gitserver_rules.yml)\n\ntarget files which must have the suffix _targets.yml in their filename (ie local_targets.yml)\n\nRule files and target files must use the latest Prometheus 2.x syntax.\n\nThe environment variable PROMETHEUS_ADDITIONAL_FLAGS can be used to pass on additional flags to the prometheus executable running in the container.\n\nAccessing Prometheus directly\n\nMost of the time, Sourcegraph site admins will monitor and query key metrics through Grafana, rather than through Prometheus directly. Grafana also provides the dashboards that monitor the standard metrics that indicate the health of the instance. Follow the instructions below to access Prometheus directly instead.\n\nIf you are using the Kubernetes deployment option, port-forward the Prometheus service:\n\nIf you are using Docker Single Container or the Docker Compose deployment option, you will need to restart the Sourcegraph container with a flag --publish 9090:9090 in the docker run command.\n\nPrometheus will be available http://localhost:9090.\n\nUsing a custom monitoring system",
      "# [SMTP and email delivery](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/config/email)\nSourcegraph uses an SMTP server of your choosing to send emails for:\n\nCode Monitoring notifications\n\nInviting other users to a Sourcegraph instance, or to an organization/team on a Sourcegraph instance\n\nImportant updates to a user accounts (for example, creation of API keys)\n\nFor builtin authentication, password resets and email verification\n\nNOTE: Sourcegraph Cloud customers can take advantage of mananged SMTP servers - learn more.\n\nUser email verification\n\nMany emails delivered from a Sourcegraph instance to a user requires that the user's primary email address be verified. This helps prevent Sourcegraph from sending product emails to invalid or inactive email addresses.\n\nUsers that create accounts through an external authentication provider, such as GitHub or SAML, will automatically have verified email addresses from the external provider.\n\nWhen SMTP is configured, users that sign up through builtin authentication will have the emails they sign up with marked as unverified. To verify their email address, the user can do one of the following:\n\nClick the \"set password\" link they receive in their email\n\nIn the \"Emails\" tab of their account, click \"Send verification email\"\n\nAsk a site admin to verify their email manually through the \"Emails\" tab of their account, or through the setUserEmailVerified GraphQL mutation\n\nUsers with emails created by the site admin through the /site-admin/users/new UI will have the same behaviour as the above. Users created directly through GraphQL or the src CLI assume that the email provided is verified.\n\nNote: For SSO (Single Sign-On) enabled instances, it is important to remove the basic authentication method from the auth.providers list to prevent users from receiving password reset links. This is because users do not need passwords to log in to SSO-enabled instances. Prior to disabling the basic authentication method, please ensure that there is at least one administrator account capable of signing in via SSO. This is essential because once basic authentication is disabled, the username/password combination used to create the initial admin account will no longer be functional.\n\nConfiguring Sourcegraph to send email via Amazon AWS / SES\n\nTo use Amazon SES with Sourcegraph, first follow these steps to create an SES account for Sourcegraph.\n\nNavigate to your site configuration (e.g. https://sourcegraph.com/site-admin/configuration) and fill in the configuration:\n\nPlease note that the configured email.address (the from address) must be a verified address with SES, see this page for details.\n\nSend a test email to verify it is configured properly.\n\nConfiguring Sourcegraph to send email via Google Workspace / GMail\n\nTo use Google Workspace with Sourcegraph, you will need to create an SMTP Relay account. Be sure to choose Require SMTP Authentication and Require TLS encryption in step 7.\n\nNavigate to your site configuration (e.g. https://sourcegraph.com/site-admin/configuration) and fill in the configuration:\n\nMake sure that [email protected] in both places of the configuration matches the email address of the account you created, and that <YOUR SECRET> is replaced with the account password or app password when 2FA enabled.\n\nSend a test email to verify it is configured properly.\n\nConfiguring Sourcegraph to send email using another provider\n\nOther providers such as Mailchimp and Sendgrid may also be used with Sourcegraph. Any valid SMTP server account should do. For those two providers in specific, you may follow their documentation:\n\nhttps://mailchimp.com/developer/transactional/docs/smtp-integration/\n\nhttps://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/getting-started-smtp\n\nOnce you have an SMTP account, simply navigate to your site configuration (e.g. https://sourcegraph.com/site-admin/configuration) and fill in the configuration:\n\nA few helpful tips:\n\nemail.address is the email Sourcegraph will send email FROM. Make sure your account has privilege to send mail from that address.\n\nYou should use a TLS/SSL enabled port, either 587 or 2525. Any port number is allowed, though.\n\nThe following authentication types are allowed: PLAIN (default), CRAM-MD5, and none\n\nIf a HELO domain is required, simply add \"domain\": \"<the domain>\", under email.smtp\n\nTLS certificate verification can be disabled if your SMTP server does not have a valid TLS cert. To do so, set \"noVerifyTLS\": true, (this is not recommended and may be a security risk)\n\nSend a test email to verify it is configured properly.\n\nSending a test email\n\n(Added in Sourcegraph v3.38)\n\nTo verify email sending is working correctly, visit the GraphQL API console at e.g. https://sourcegraph.example.com/api/console and then run the following query replacing [email protected] with your personal email address:\n\nIf everything is successfully configured, you should see a response like:\n\nOtherwise, you should see an error with more information:\n\n{ \"data\": { \"sendTestEmail\": \"Failed to send test email: mail: ...\" } }",

The valid values (from most to least verbose) are:\n\ndbug: Debug. Output all logs. Default in cluster deployments.\n\ninfo: Informational.\n\nwarn: Warning. Default in Docker deployments.\n\neror: Error.\n\ncrit: Critical.\n\nLearn more about how to apply these environment variables in docker-compose and server deployments.\n\nLog format\n\nA Sourcegraph service's log output format is configured via the environment variable SRC_LOG_FORMAT. The valid values are:\n\ncondensed: Optimized for human readability.\n\njson: Machine-readable JSON format.\n\nFor certain services and log entries, Sourcegraph exports a OpenTelemetry-compliant log data model.\n\njson_gcp: Machine-readable JSON format, tailored to GCP cloud-logging expected structure.\n\nlogfmt: The logfmt format.\n\nNote that logfmt is no longer supported with Sourcegraph's new internal logging standards - if you need structured logs, we recommend using json instead. If set to logfmt, log output from new loggers will be in condensed format.\n\nOpenTelemetry\n\nWhen configured to export JSON logs, Sourcegraph services that have migrated to the new internal logging standard that will export a JSON log format compliant with OpenTelemetry's log data model:\n\nWe also include the following non-OpenTelemetry fields:\n\nLog level overrides\n\nA Sourcegraph service's log level can be configured for a specific InstrumentationScope and it's children. For example you can keep your log level at error, but turn on debug logs for a specific component. This is only used to increase verbosity. IE it can't be used to mute a scope.\n\nThis is configured by the environment variable SRC_LOG_SCOPE_LEVEL. It has the format SCOPE_0=LEVEL_0,SCOPE_1=LEVEL_1,.... For example to turn on debug logs for service.UpdateScheduler and repoPurgeWorker you would set the following on the repo-updater service:\n\nNote that this will also affect child scopes. So in the example you will also receive debug logs from service.UpdateScheduler.RunUpdateLoop.\n\nLog sampling\n\nSourcegraph services that have migrated to the new internal logging standard have log sampling enabled by default. The first 100 identical log entries per second will always be output, but thereafter only every 100th identical message will be output.\n\nThis behaviour can be configured for each service using the following environment variables:\n\nSRC_LOG_SAMPLING_INITIAL: the number of entries with identical messages to always output per second\n\nSRC_LOG_SAMPLING_THEREAFTER: the number of entries with identical messages to discard before emitting another one per second, after SRC_LOG_SAMPLING_INITIAL.",

      "# [Scaling Overview for Services](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/admin/deploy/scale)\nThis page provides a comprehensive overview of how each Sourcegraph service scales. In order to support the growth of your instance usage, it is recommended to scale Sourcegraph based on the scaling factors suggested below.\n\nGrafana should be the first stop you make if you plan to expand on one of the scaling factors or when you are experiencing a system performance issue.\n\nPlease use the following scaling guideline for services that are using more than 80% of their assigned resources.\n\nScaling is unnecessary if your resource usage is kept below 80%.\n\nFor example, if you plan to add 100% more engaged users, and the resource usage for all services is currently at around 70%, we’d recommend using this documentation as a reference to adjust the resources that list “Number of active users” as one of their scaling factors. You can also use the output from the Resource Estimator as references alternatively.\n\nFor assistance when scaling and tuning Sourcegraph, contact us. We're happy to help!\n\nComponents Overview\n\nHere is a list of components you can find in a typical Sourcegraph deployment:\n\nCore Components\n\nfrontendServes the web application, extensions, and graphQL services. Almost every service has a link back to the frontend, from which it gathers configuration updates.gitserverMirrors repositories from their code host. All other Sourcegraph services talk to gitserver when they need data from git.precise-code-intelConverts LSIF upload file into Postgres data. The entire index must be read into memory to be correlated.repo-updaterTracks the state of repositories. It is responsible for automatically scheduling updates using gitserver and for synchronizing metadata between code hosts and external services.searcherProvides on-demand un-indexed search for repositories. It fetches archives from gitserver and searches them with regexp.symbolsIndexes symbols in repositories using Ctags.syntect-serverAn HTTP server that exposes the Rust Syntect syntax highlighting library for use by other services.workerRuns a collection of background jobs periodically in response to internal requests and external events. It is currently janitorial and commit based.zoekt-indexserverIndexes all enabled repositories on Sourcegraph and keeps the indexes up to date. Lives inside the indexed-search pod in a Kubernetes deployment.zoekt-webserverRuns searches from indexes stored in memory and disk. The indexes are persisted to disk to avoid re-indexing on startup.

      "# [Code Insights data retention](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/code_insights/explanations/data_retention)\nNOTE: This reference is only relevant from the 4.5 release.\n\nOn creation a Code Insight will show you 12 data points per series. Your Code Insight will then get an additional ephemeral data point daily, and a persisted additional data point at every interval that was specified on insight creation.\n\nPrior to release 4.5, this growth was unbound. From 4.5, the oldest data points will be truncated and stored separately according to the sample size specified in the site configuration with the setting shown below. This means that if you have an insight with 50 data points, and a maximum sample size of 30, the oldest 20 points will be truncated and archived in a separate table.\n\nThe sample size value is set to 30 by default and can only be increased to a maximum of 90.\n\nA background routine will periodically go over Code Insights and move the oldest data points to a separate table. If you want to access this data, you are given the option to export all data for a Code Insight, which will include archived data.\n\nIMPORTANT: Your data is never deleted. It is only moved to a separate database table.\n\nData exporting\n\nYou can download all data for a Code Insight, including data that has been archived. You can do this:\n\nFrom the insight card menu\n\nFrom the standalone page\n\nBy curling the API endpoint\n\nThe data will be exported as a CSV file. Only data that you are permitted to see will be excluded (i.e. repository permissions are enforced).\n\nIf you have filtered your Code Insight using repository filters or a search context, the data exported will be filtered according to those.\n\nDynamic filtering\n\nThe option now exists on Code Insights filters to limit the number of samples loaded per series. There is one setting per insight that applies to all series on that insight. Adjusting this setting will only apply to one insight and will not have any impact on stored Code Insights data.\n\nBenefits\n\nCode Insights should be faster to load.\n\nCode Insights with a lot of data points that were previously hard to read or hover over will now be more legible.\n\nCode Insights data can now be exported in CSV format.\n\nAccessing this feature prior to 4.5\n\nYou can enable this retention procedure from Sourcegraph 4.4 if you are a site admin with the following setting:"

To answer your question:\n\n- You get the IDE features on your codehost. So you can find references inside of a pull request/etc.\n\n- You don't need to have a checkout / switch branches (can be costly depending on your dev env / dev scale)\n\n- We focus on cross repository tools. IDEs are usually work within a project context.\n\nPersonally I use the text search a _lot_, even though I could just use my editor. This is mainly due to it being a browser search shortcut + the more expressive search syntax + nicer UI for browsing/reading code.\n\n#### Comment ID e70ou53 with +9 score by [(alexthelyon, Reddit, 2018-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9kmr4p/sourcegraph_is_now_open_source/e70ou53/) (in reply to ID e70nbpf):\nAny plans to support gitlab?

Seems like for public repos the extension works fine, i.e, i can see references, goto, in the github repo, but for private github repos not so much. Is it a bug or thats a premium feature?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: So looks like this is related to the chrome extension only. Tried with firefox and it works. so just the chrome extension needs fixing.\n\n### Comment ID e70lz1i with +5 score by [(slimsag, Reddit, 2018-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9kmr4p/sourcegraph_is_now_open_source/e70lz1i/) (in reply to ID e70l5fn):\nQuoting [my Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18119288):\n\n> Sourcegrapher here -- two main things:\n>\n> 1.

And every single symbol (variable name, method/fn name, class name, constant, etc.) is linked to all references to that symbol. So e.g. you can just click any class or method and see every single usage of that class or method or constant across the entire codebase (every single google project, every single dependency, every single language, etc....). Its also tied in with our build system (internally called blaze or externally called bazel), so you can e.g. load proto file in the browser and then see all generated sources from that file (like the Java, js, c++, or python class from protoc) even though they don't actually exist on disk.\n\nMostly it's the search that is amazing, e.g.\n\nhttps://cs.opensource.google/search?q=lang:java%20OutputStream%20-f:Test%20&ss=protobuf%2Fprotobuf\n\nCode search exposes predicates that show understandings of the language. e.g. you can avoid matching string in a code comment but using the \"usage:\" predicate.\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/code-search/reference\n\nThe tools scale so that a single project can easily have thousands of files and large teams (100s of SWEs) can remotely collaborate efficiently.\n\nWe also have our code review tool, internally called critique. That exposes it's own search indices for searching all (un)submitted changes, e.g. search all changes from Jan 1 to Feb 3, on files matching .*Foo.java, with change text \"bar\", under path a/b/c. This really helps bisecting regressions.\n\nHonestly, the tooling makes me 10x more efficient than I am otherwise on my own.\n\n## Comment ID i01in3p with +1 score by [(quetejodas, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i01in3p/) (in reply to ID tahdd2):\nAgent Ransack\n\n## Comment ID i01m72n with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i01m72n/) (in reply to ID tahdd2):\nMost of it I do in VSCode and IDE but sometimes I use Meld for change detection and the good old `find -iname` plus a ton of either bash or half-baked Python.\n\n## Comment ID i01n3ws with +1 score by [(Isvara, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i01n3ws/) (in reply to ID tahdd2):\nhttps://elixir.bootlin.com/\n\n## Comment ID i01xvoc with +1 score by [(pancakeQueue, Reddit, 2022-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tahdd2/what_code_search_tools_do_you_use_at_your_job/i01xvoc/) (in reply to ID tahdd2):\nThe VSCode extension GitLens is fantastic.

I've tried using tree-sitter to find references, go to definition, and they work to an extent but fails with variable references and cannot differentiate constructors and functions. I did some research (idk if i did enough but I'm exhausted at not finding a solution) and found [SCIP](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/announcing-scip). Its an alternative to LSIF but I have no idea how to use it. It has a Protobuf schema explaining the way it creates the index.scip file that contains all the basic symbol information like references and definition but i have no idea how to even extract this information and use it. \n\nI'm a student doing this as a project and i really hit a roadblock here. Would really appreciate some help on this.\n\nAlso, are there any open-source language servers that i can use?\n\n## Comment ID l00pz1p with +7 score by [(olafurpg, Reddit, 2024-04-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/1c659cl/has_anyone_tried_using_sourcegraphs_scip_to/l00pz1p/) (in reply to ID 1c659cl):\nAuthor of SCIP here. I’m sorry if this comment is a bit all over the place, I’m sitting in my kids room waiting for my 8wo twins to fall asleep. \n\nIt’s true that there are no high level guides on how to extract or work with SCIP. It takes a bit of practice to work with the data, understand how to process symbols and run all of this efficiently. If you overcome this barrier, it opens up a ton of doors for building useful language agnostic developer tooling.\n\nSCIP standalone is not sufficient to implement a language server but it can be a helpful component of a language server. The Scala language server, Metals, uses SemanticDB which is effectively the same thing as SCIP. You can take a look at the Metals codebase for inspiration if you’re familiar with Scala. For example, here’s one blog post explaining the approach to implement fast “find references” with SemanticDB symbols http://scalameta.org/metals/blog/2019/01/22/bloom-filters.\n\nMetals uses heavily the Scala presentation compiler to support low-latency interactions that wouldn’t be possible with a batch indexer like the SCIP indexers you’ve seen. However, deep inside the interactions with the presentation compiler, Metals converts compiler symbols into SemanticDB symbol to lookup stuff from an index (generated by batch indexers). If you’re building a non-trivial application with SCIP then it’s inevitable that you’ll end up using tricks like that.\n\nEvery developer tool ends up having different needs (performance, language coverage, features, memory usage, disk footprint, runtime, …) making it difficult to support off-the-shelf library APIs to work with SCIP data. The total number of devtools authors who are interested in using this data is also so small making it difficult to justify the investment in providing off-the-shelf solutions.\n\n### Comment ID l09dyfr with +3 score by [(son_of_Gib, Reddit, 2024-04-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/1c659cl/has_anyone_tried_using_sourcegraphs_scip_to/l09dyfr/) (in reply to ID l00pz1p):\nCongrats on the twins!!\n\nAlso I've never worked on Scala but this is an interesting read.

The last interview I had with them was pretty conversational.  I had a background in some of the problems they were working on and during the conversation I brought up a sort of improvement/trick I had figured out in the past and the interviewer said it was something they had never considered before and seemed really interested in it which I thought was a good sign.  But unfortunately they ghosted me after that.  But here's the crazy part.  Sourcegraph has some open source repos and out of curiosity I decided to look at one the other day.  I looked at a few of the recent PRs and one of them caught my eye.  The PR was the EXACT improvement/trick that I brought up in my interview.  I look at who created the PR and, of course, it was the guy who interviewed me.  I looked at the date and it was about a week after my interview happened.  So this place ghosted me AND used me for free consulting.

However, there are a couple of things to consider. First, people throw out ideas all the time. If your interviewer got a way to improve the code base from you, there’s no reason to not make that improvement. It’s not like you’re there to make it yourself. They’re not going to let their product remain suboptimal for no reason. Second, they most likely had no input into whether you were ghosted; that’s on your recruiter.

Don't let the following wall of text scare you; most of you will just have to install the extension and start searching!\n\n---\n\nBefore I joined Sourcegraph, code search wasn’t on my radar. Since I’ve been here, however, it has become an indispensable tool in my toolbox. Now, being able to use Sourcegraph in my editor, without having to context switch to a browser, has made me even more effective. Here are some use cases where I find Sourcegraph to be very helpful:\n\n- Search [“the universe of open source code”](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/why-index-the-oss-universe/): We’re planning to migrate this project from webpack to esbuild. I used the query `select:repo esbuild and importScripts(` to find other projects that have handled loading Web Workers using esbuild.\n- Search your team’s code: if you’ve [added your private repositories to Sourcegraph.com](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/how-to/adding_repositories_to_cloud) or you have a [self-hosted Sourcegraph instance](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install), you can easily search over them with this extension. I find myself using this extension over even native VS Code search for the open workspace to take advantage of our powerful [query language](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/reference/queries) and syntax-highlighted search results. \n- Check out more use cases in our [launch blog post](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/ways-to-use-sourcegraph-extension-for-vs-code)\n\nHere are some workflow tips:\n\n- Use `cmd+shift+8`/`cmd+*` (`ctrl` for Windows/Linux) to search selected text, or just focus the search tab if there are no selections. If you search a *lot*, you could maintain an [editor group](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_editor-groups) with your local files in one group and the Sourcegraph search tab and remote files in another group.\n- If you’re using this for work, I recommend creating a [search context](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/introducing-search-contexts/) to scope your searches to relevant repositories. You can switch to the `global` search context when you’re working on open source projects :)\n- Quickly share links to the currently viewed file, whether it is local or remote, by opening the command palette and running the `\"Copy Sourcegraph File Link\"` command.\n\n**Fun tech demo**: [cross-repo navigation through remote files thanks to our amazing code intel team, watch in HD](https://gfycat.com/earlyalivefeline). \n\n---\n\n**What can we do for you?**\n\nOur ultimate goal is to make it so everyone can code, and that starts with making tools that make developers like you and me more productive. What kind of features could we add to this extension that would help you day-to-day? \n\n([source code](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@tjk/vsce-search-ui/-/blob/client/vscode/src/extension.ts))\n\n### Comment ID hwcm2x6 with +5 score by [(ryan_the_leach, Reddit, 2022-02-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/vscode/comments/sowwe7/we_made_an_extension_to_search_and_navigate_2/hwcm2x6/) (in reply to ID hwbn8t2):\nThis seems cool and all, but it also seems a really fast way to get you to end up on the pointy end of the GPL license...

You can keep \"memory\" in files (inside Visual Studio Code). To add a file to context, you just \"@\" it (Cody will provide a context menu so you can choose your file from a list).\n\nYou can chat with GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 3 Opus... or you can actually code. I've started doing both. It's really weird.\n\nIt's the closest I've gotten to having an *actual* copilot.\n\nYou can even make a blank text file, add a prompt like \"This is a story about a super cute puppy who saves a super cute kitty from a super horrible death-y!\" and it'll run with it, autocompleting your prose as you type.\n\nIt's magic. As is its ability to \"mount\" documentation. You can pull a git repo, and Cody will add it to its search scope, enhancing chat/autocomplete even further.\n\nYou also get \"Cody Web Chat\" with the account. I mainly use it while in transit. I can pop it open on my phone, either chat, or mount a git repository and study/code-spelunking.\n\nCody is much more than just chat+autocomplete. If all that functionality existed in a separate desktop app (like a dedicated chatting/writing environment), it's what people would use. For the money, you can't beat it. I hope this helps :)\n\n#### Comment ID l0yuon8 with +2 score by [(Prolacticus, Reddit, 2024-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1cbdoij/claude_3_vs_gpt4_vs_perplexity_vs_poe/l0yuon8/) (in reply to ID l0ysmk8):\nI just realized I should add: Cody is intended for software development. While it's very hackable (in the good sense - the \"let's see what we can make this thing do!\" sense), you need to be familiar with the tools and nomenclature.\n\nIf you're just looking for chat, I'd recommend sticking with ChatGPT Pro. I love Cody - I'd take a bullet for Cody - but I still have my ChatGPT Pro account because I love custom GPTs and the streamlined environment.\n\nSo, while you can use Cody in ways very similar to ChatGPT Pro, there *are* differences. The biggest question is whether you're familiar with Visual Studio Code. The $9/mo... that's a no-brainer for unlimited Claude 3 Opus.\n\n### Comment ID l0ywzwo with +3 score by [(ubeyou, Reddit, 2024-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1cbdoij/claude_3_vs_gpt4_vs_perplexity_vs_poe/l0ywzwo/) (in reply to ID l0y7zko):\nWould like to ask what's their maximum context size?

Though Sourcegraph's Cody can technically use every available token, the \"usable\" cutoff of for high quality coding generations is, in a practical way, much lower.\n\nI'm unsure of the current max context size, but the post said it's growing. I believe it said it's going to support a full 100k.\n\nAnd there are *no* rate limits. There's no catch. It's as glorious as it sounds.\n\nFurther, one of Sourcegraph's biggest Things is code search. They've been pumping out scary-good enterprise code search tools for *enormous* projects. I don't even understand why they put out Cody (except perhaps to attract enterprise customers). The benefit to us is that it doesn't *have* to send everything. It creates a local search database that it uses to grab only the appropriate context. It *works*. And if it doesn't, you can override Cody's automatic search choices by specifying context using the \"@\" syntax.\n\nHope this helps. I'm always happy to talk about Cody :)\n\n### Comment ID l18v6i4 with +3 score by [(DavidG2P, Reddit, 2024-04-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1cbdoij/claude_3_vs_gpt4_vs_perplexity_vs_poe/l18v6i4/) (in reply to ID l0y7zko):\nThanks for pointing the thread to Cody! \n\nI'm not a programmer, but still managed to create a specialized Windows application using Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS, by co-coding everything with ChatGPT.\n\nI'm a bit stuck at the moment because it becomes more and more tedious to get ChatGPT up and running again about what the program does, which part of the code does what etc. every time I'm about to improve something in my application.\n\nDo you think that Cody could help with that? If so, how would you recommend to go about it? Should I create an online repository and point Cody to it?\n\nWould it make sense to save all related previous conversations with ChatGPT to one or multiple txt files in order to teach Cody about the past of the project?\n\n#### Comment ID l18y0ra with +3 score by [(Prolacticus, Reddit, 2024-04-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1cbdoij/claude_3_vs_gpt4_vs_perplexity_vs_poe/l18y0ra/) (in reply to ID l18v6i4):\nStop whatever you're doing right now, go to Sourcegraph, grab Cody, plonk down $9 for a month. It's the perfect time because, at least where I am (Portland, OR), **ChatGPT is down right now, but Cody is still up (GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 3 Opus... all of it)**.\n\nPart of the beauty of Cody is how smart it is about *what* to send as additional context for the user's query. Like, if I asked ChatGPT \"How can I add a field to somefile.py that returns the current time?\" it wouldn't know what to do because it doesn't have access to my codebase: only whatever's in a given chat window.\n\nAs you open/close Cody chat tabs (you can keep many open at once, each backed by a different LLM), Cody will still \"remember\" what you talked about in the sense that, and I can't stress this enough, *Cody chat AND autocomplete take into account the relevant code elsewhere in your workspace (it doesn't just work across files: it works across projects, and that power is tremendous)*.\n\nYou don't have to ask it what \"someObject.someMethod\" does: It'll tell *you* what it does. You only have to ask.\n\nIf Cody can't \"find\" the file, try using \"@\" and select the file you want Cody to work with. It's still a v1 product, so it's not perfect.\n\nBut it'll make you far more productive as a coder than ChatGPT ever could. And you aren't losing anything because, again, you'll still have access to GPT-4 Turbo.\n\nI still have a couple ChatGPT accounts, but I use them for non-coding tasks (mostly).\n\nIf my task involves Coding, Cody is where I go. And if you just want to chat with Cody, you can do that, too (Claude 3 Opus is *very* smart, and *very* fun). Just keep a single VSC window open with some Cody chat tabs. You get unlimited chat (including the wildly expensive Claude 3 Opus), and you can use it to talk about the weather if that's how you're feeling. Because that one VSC window is so resource-light, it won't bog down your computer. It's like having a fancy native dedicated chat app.\n\nAnd if you do take the plunge, *please* share your thoughts. When talking to other Cody users, you'll find a lot of people like me. After you spend time with Cody, everything else seems lesser. We're all simultaneously perplexed about the low pricewall and the actual value. Just getting access to Claude 3 Opus alone for $9/month... I don't understand how anyone can turn away from that.\n\nThe short answer to your question: Just try Cody! I promise you won't regret giving it a chance for a month. Keep in mind it does *far* more than ChatGPT does, and it takes a little time to learn it all. But you *will* learn it. Cody's there to help :)\n\n#### Comment ID l18zd0c with +2 score by [(Prolacticus, Reddit, 2024-04-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1cbdoij/claude_3_vs_gpt4_vs_perplexity_vs_poe/l18zd0c/) (in reply to ID l18v6i4):\nOh! Oh! Oh! Also! You don't have to copy/paste the way you do between ChatGPT and your actual code. You can, and it's much easier with Cody because it's all in the same environment and in the same window, but you can also click \"Insert at Caret\" and it'll automatically insert the code into the file at your cursor's current position. And if you really want to get down with your bad self, you can even click the \"New File...\" option. It wasn't there when Cody was born, probably because it's a subtly powerful feature. But, wow, it makes it easy to get things done.\n\n**Caveat:** For some reason, *sometimes*, the copy/insert/new file buttons don't appear. Something in a recent update seems to have introduced a bug. However, it's not a huge deal because the code to insert will still be embedded in a code field in chat, so if things get really bad, you can copy/paste ChatGPT style. But I'm sure they'll fix this. Right, Sourcegraph? RIGHT?! (If you shout, they'll hear - that's what I tell myself.)\n\nPlus, you have the usual inline autocomplete, contextual auto-documenting (working on someone else's undocumented code? Cody will generate all the comments for you - and it'll use those comment cues in chat and autocomplete)...\n\nYou can use the \"Command Palette\" to perform, well, commands. Like \"Smell Code\" (**so nice**). \"Explain this Code,\" etc. And you can make your own commands. I haven't done that yet because Cody is a world of its own and I haven't yet hit a wall.\n\nSorry. I just had another cup of coffee. I can't shut up :)\n\n### Comment ID l104anw with +1 score by [(Zulfiqaar, Reddit, 2024-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1cbdoij/claude_3_vs_gpt4_vs_perplexity_vs_poe/l104anw/) (in reply to ID l0y7zko):\nI just started using cursor, going to retry continue-dev, used to have GH copilot, have to check this out now..any comparisons?\n\n#### Comment ID l120qyr with +2 score by [(creativefisher, Reddit, 2024-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1cbdoij/claude_3_vs_gpt4_vs_perplexity_vs_poe/l120qyr/) (in reply to ID l104anw):\nSome comparisons on the website - [https://sourcegraph.com/compare](https://sourcegraph.com/compare)\n\n### Comment ID l12xbu7 with +1 score by [(Fantastic_Act1602, Reddit, 2024-04-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1cbdoij/claude_3_vs_gpt4_vs_perplexity_vs_poe/l12xbu7/) (in reply to ID l0y7zko):\nI'm a cyber security engineer.

Cody's happy to work with whatever language you throw at it. And if you're working with non-Python code, you can ask Cody to transpile, and it'll knock your socks off.

Since then, there has been no sense of safety or longevity. You clock in each day with the idea that it could be your last.\n\nThe smartest leaders were shown the door, and the ones that kept their jobs were the loyalists to the exec suite's ideas, no matter how weak or deranged. The exec suite thought it was a good idea to change what we sold and for how much every few months, then berated teams for not hitting quota (which was next to impossible when there was no direction). \n\nThis environment quickly spiraled in to the Hunger Games. Exec meetings became tense and the ICs felt the trickle down as managers threw their own people under the bus. The calibration cycle almost a year ago was incredibly brutal, built solely on an agenda to make as many top performers quit as possible to save some cash. \n\nWhat used to make this place worthwhile (location-agnostic pay, work-life balance) doesn't exist anymore. Instead, you'll join a company that gets off on backstabbing, steamrolling, and punishment. The bad managers do nothing but gaslight and indulge in toxicity with their direct reports. They play favorites and if you're not in the \"in\" club, you'll be shown the pink slip soon enough. The ones that \"succeed\" here are the \"yes\" men (and yes, it is mostly men since DEI isn't a priority anymore) and the ones that are willing to put their health, mental state, and/or personal life on the line in order to get ahead for a company that will quickly lose the AI race to any number of stronger giants. Working late nights and weekends is the rule, not the exception, but they'll lead with their \"work from anywhere\" culture in interviews to make it seem reasonable. \n\nIt does not matter if you've been successful at Sourcegraph or have hit your goals consistently quarter after quarter. If they decide that they don't like you, you'll be gaslit, punished, and eventually pushed to leave.\n\nThey hire some of the smartest people that I've ever met, but they abuse them to the point that the best friends I made at Sourcegraph were due to trauma bonding together.",

          "advice": "To the Sourcegraph management, particularly the CEO: It's impressive to see a CEO with the highest commit rate in the whole company, but it might be time to leverage this enthusiasm differently. While your GitHub commit rate is impressive, delegating this task to your development team might be more beneficial. With the company at a crucial stage, your time and expertise could be more impactful in addressing strategic issues and steering the company towards success.\n\nFor the CTO: The key to great software development lies in a strong, well-supported team. Reflecting on the consistent feedback in these reviews could be enlightening. This introspection may help fine-tune your leadership approach, enhancing team dynamics and contributing positively to Sourcegraph’s trajectory.\n\nTo the ever-evolving leadership team at Sourcegraph: As you navigate your new roles, be mindful that job security has been a recurring challenge within the company. It's crucial not to take any outcomes personally. Numerous highly skilled predecessors have faced similar situations. Stay positive but honest, give it your best, and remember that the outcome is more about the company's ongoing dynamics than a measure of your individual talents. Wishing you the best of luck in your endeavors.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "I wanted to share some real talk about my time at Sourcegraph, especially since you might be considering a role there. It's always good to go in with both eyes open, right?\n\nThe work environment at Sourcegraph isn't just a mixed bag; it presents considerable challenges. They've made a strategic pivot recently, but that's only part of the story. The leadership team has been completely overhauled multiple times in just two years. It's tough to have any confidence in the longevity of the current leadership when you've seen their predecessors shown the door one after the other. Initially, these changes brought a sense of hope, but by the third round, it's hard not to feel a bit sorry for the new leaders who are trying their best - just like the last ones did.\n\nRegarding the executive team, to put it simply, they lack experience. There's a palpable sense of internal strife, almost like they're participants in their own version of the Hunger Games, each afraid of being the next to go. This atmosphere of uncertainty doesn't lead to outright micromanagement, but something perhaps more frustrating. Often, you'll receive vague directives like \"make it better\" without clear guidance on what that actually means. If you dare to ask for clarification, you risk being labeled as entitled. And remember, how you interpret and act on these vague instructions will come back around in your impact reviews, which I'll get into a bit more later.\n\nJob security is a significant concern. Layoffs have become a recurring theme, not just an occasional blip. It's happened several times over the last two years alone. With the management structure in constant flux, you never really feel settled. It's like standing on shifting sands, always unsure of where you stand or who you'll report to next or if they will even be left around by the next review cycle.\n\nNow, let's talk about the impact reviews. Sourcegraph has been around for a decade, so they're far from a startup. The real issue is that they're struggling to find a way to significantly increase revenue to finally IPO. The CEO and CTO seem to be out of fresh ideas, so there's this pressure on employees to come up with million-dollar ideas - or to “make it better” 😉. If you don't come up with something that substantially boosts the bottom line, you're labeled as not making an impact, putting you at risk of being in the next round of layoffs which always seem to be just around the corner. Even if you do come up with a great idea, it gets absorbed by the top brass, and then it's back to square one - you need another big idea, increase your commit rate (which gets judged at impact reviews) or go back to helping endless new hires, new management, and customer success team navigate a tech stack that's been left hollow by the departure of the many skilled devs that owned them but have left due to layoffs or attrition and hope that they perceive those efforts as impactful.\n\nIn short, while there are some perks like fair pay, the overall environment is fraught with peril, from unstable leadership and job insecurity to a high-pressure culture around million dollar feature ideas. It's a lot to take on, and I just wanted you to know what you might be getting into.\n\nWishing you the best in your job search and career. Take care!",

Layoffs are a common occurrence as well, with several having occurred in the past year- not all of them related to the economy either. Things have been on a downward trajectory, and with the hiring of new senior leadership, we are now headed over a cliff. The culture has done a complete 180 in the past few months. It has gone from great, to ok, to I-don’t-believe-what-I’m-hearing/seeing in record time. Gone are the days where employees felt they could speak up or disagree without being shamed or berated. You can tell that the few remaining leaders are more inclined to just go along with what upper leadership wants, simply out of fear. Attrition is high. Backfills are nil. People leave and their reasoning is different than what senior leadership then tells you. Most of leadership has turned over in the past few months. Do more with less is the prevailing sentiment. People are being required to do things WAY outside their job scope, or else be managed out. There is constant talk of how things work at Amazon or google. Many current employees even left those places to escape the toxic cultures that are now being touted as supreme… and inevitable. Diversity is severely neglected. Senior leadership does not value the opinions but of a few select people, which is clear by public communications. This is has gone from a wonderful people focused company to a truly chaotic at best, and soul crushing at worst, place to work.",

If I had something important to discuss with my manager and a zoom was more appropriate, sometimes my manager would insist I send a slack. My manager would then take time to critique my slack message with suggestions on how I could shorten it in the future. \r\n\r\n* Half-hearted attempt at diversity: There is a real desire to foster DEI as part of the culture, but I never felt like it was really executed on while I was there. There were things they did well (hiring across the world &amp; pay equity) but also lot of areas where it fell short.\r\n\r\n Examples of how it fell short: Very clique-ish culture. A primarily white/male dominated environment when I was there, in particular, most of the managers and leaders were white and/or male. Their recruiting team is not diverse, which is odd to me if you're making a push to hire for diversity. There was no official DEI group or any ERGs to create community. There was no pay transparency between departments and roles. \r\n\r\n* Leadership is inexperienced and communication from them could be better Leaders, as individuals, were some of the most talented people i've ever met, but in leadership roles they couldn't seem to make a cohesive decision or if they did, it felt like they made it too late...always felt like we were a little behind the curve. \r\n\r\nExample: Leaders tried really hard to differentiate themselves from Github through numerous pivots and tangential ideas but never seemed to quite pull it off. I'm not surprised they have now chosen the *brilliant* idea to pivot into the ai coding assistant space, once again putting it in a struggle against Github's robust and impressively developed Copilot. \r\n\r\nA lot of these pivots were made to try to gain traction somewhere, anywhere, and in my opinion is partially due to a disconnect between product and engineering. It seemed like the PMs had constant uphill battles leading to a revolving door of PMs coming and going. This is also evident with the marketing department. While I was there it felt like those departments were never set up for success.",

There has been a lot of change this year. Partially due to the downturn and partially due to a change in leadership. Large scale changes are always hard and when it is coupled with the worst economic environment in over a decade, things have been tough but improving. The leadership changes were a must and I feel like we've really 'up-leveled' the exec team (as our CEO has said) and think we have better people in place to lead us across Eng, Product, Sales, and People. The leadership team is also young / new to positions of power / authority and and have made some big mistakes.

That's the thing that matters most, because it makes up for a lot of pain associated with growing and scaling. Due to a combination of crazy tech funding over the last 2 - 3 years and our leadership's ability to assembling one of the most impressive boards (a16z, Sequoia, Craft, Redpoint, and a few others), we secured 125M+ in Series D funding. As a result, we have incredibly high cash reserves that allows us to stay focused on building for the long-term and not having to make short-sighted decisions just to stay alive in the short-term. We are still investing in our business, we are still growing in areas that show strong returns, and I feel like if / when you can prove out an MVP you can and will get support from leadership in the form of budget and head count. We have still faced our own cuts (more on that below), but where there is momentum there is support. We are transparent. Probably to a fault. I honestly find it a little scary that I know everything about our business. All of our finances, our spending, our revenue growth is publicly available for anyone and everyone at the company. Not only that, our head of finance / ops regularly talks about our head count plans, what our forecasting numbers will look like and what will happen if we don't meet targets. I genuinely love working with most of the people at this company. Lots of eager, smart, and genuinely customer-oriented people that just want to make our customers happy. Comp is pretty great. Our handbook has a stated goal to pay everyone at 75% of their job band so we pay, by definition, above market (this isn't always clean but I rarely hear anyone complain about their compensation). This also comes with high expectations that we hire great talent and pay for it. There is pressure there that isn't for everyone.",

You’re much more likely to be pushed outside your comfort zone than to ever feel like you’re stuck working on things that aren’t important and don’t challenge you (and who wants that?). Expectations are high, but you get the support that you need when you ask for it. People are always happy to help, and everyone I’ve worked with here–from the exec team to managers to ICs–is really nice, and really smart. I’m constantly inspired by my colleagues. Regardless of their level, everyone feels accessible. I really appreciate the flexibility to work when it makes the most sense for me. So long as I’m delivering high quality work and am able to collaborate effectively, nobody really cares when I’m at my desk. And I feel comfortable taking time off to reset when I need it.",

SteveY only cares about the technical side of things but seems to be calling all the shots. Take a serious look in the mirror - did recent opt-out opportunities actually move Sourcegraph toward the culture you want to create? Do you even know what that culture is? Why were opt-outs in prod/engineering disproportionately female relative to the rest of prod/engineering? Define the culture you actual want, and why, and make decisions accordingly. The company is far too directionless, which is a real shame because the product is awesome. Who are you? Who do you want to be? How will you get there? Continue to be fully transparent with new hires about the challenges and opportunities. Obviously the recent spike in reviews tells you company culture change is happening and acknowledged internally - how will you position that to candidates?",

Within this change in culture, there exists great opportunity for individuals who are looking for opportunities to make big impact and advance quickly in their careers by taking on a ton of responsibility. This is a founder-led organization, where the founders expect everyone to give as much time and effort possible to Sourcegraph - they are understandably completely invested in the product and expect the same of Teammates. You will be expected to embrace The Grind of start up life.. You will feel like you have to be responsive at all times because \"asynchronous\" culture results in a lot of evening, weekend, and holiday work (BTW many roles are pulled into tons of meetings). It's important to understand what \"be flexible\" means in the context of a lot of these reviews - be ready for quick changes in direction, because there is a serious lack of commitment to long-term plans. The 30 day minimum PTO requirement is great, in theory, but not enforced or monitored in any way. Lastly, despite being a high performer (and rewarded as such), I felt this was a place where the consequences of making a mistake were high, particularly when interacting with senior leadership. I witnessed individuals very abruptly go from being valued contributors to sidelined. Most top performers do not have families, and those who do have a partner that does care taking. Ask questions during the interview process about what's important to you - you will get straightforward answers from most hiring managers. Know that \"scrappy\" is code for working a lot, \"high performance culture\" means taking direction well, and being \"flexible\" equates to frequently changing direction or doing things very last-minute based on arbitrary deadlines.",

          "pros": "Compensation is good. Generally speaking, transparency is a lived value. They are doing remote work the right way, with 2x per year company meet ups in awesome locations, a generous office set up stipend, a cell phone/internet stipend, and reimbursement for co-working space. Depending on your team, the PTO policy is good (depending on role, expect to check in on slack/email/get texts on occasion while on vacation, though). There is a huge opportunity here for people willing to devote a ton of their lives to work - and leadership is making intentional steps to foster that environment. The handbook is awesome, and internal processes are documented well, although it can be information overload. The company uses Slack heavily (a pro, in my book, provided you are comfortable with wading through large amounts of information and being tagged in tons of CYA-type posts). I did not appreciate the culture shift that happened after I joined, where leadership doesn't care about people who were good at their jobs choosing to leave, so I left quickly myself. I'm great at what I do and therefore do not need to work for a company that doesn't value good management, promotes competition between team members, and doesn't respect work/life boundaries. But, on the flip side, I learned a TON and had the opportunity to work on a lot of cool stuff - that's why this is in the pros. Also, most of the people I worked with were genuinely awesome. Sourcegraph does know how to hire great people. I loved how international the team is - so cool to work with people from all over on a near-daily basis.",

          "advice": "Engineering culture is getting a rebuild. Yay! Lots of growing pains there but I am excited to see where engineering goes next despite all the stress and whiplash it has caused. However, we are seeing big gaps in culture generally as well as non-engineering teams like marketing, product, and dev experience. We need good, experienced leaders in there ASAP that will be trusted and respected and listened to and seen as equals to the engineering department. We can't keep losing good people because they aren't being supported in doing things outside the limited POV of what is correct according to leadership and outspoken senior developers.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "- There's a lot of potential for things to go super well but any new employee beware that things are really chaotic right now. But if you're looking for a young start-up trying to figure things out, great! Just know that things do NOT feel like a mature start-up (yet) even though there's Series D funding and Sourcegraph has been around for 10 years. - If you're not a more senior engineer (and in some cases Sales), it's hard to make an impact and do good work. Lots of really smart people have left because their expertise was dismissed, especially true of the product, marketing, design, and dev/customer experience teams where we continue to see high turnover. Leadership will continually say that these people have left because of some issue like low performance or culture misfit when really theses super talented people tried many times to make an impact but were stalled at every turn. Not only does it make me distrust leadership it also makes me feel like if I struggle to succeed, it will always be my fault alone and leadership won't do any self-reflection or support me. Case in point, a lot of these recent 5 star reviews seem to be a little fake to me... You can't necessarily trust what they say... And maybe leadership is creating them to cover up more critical problems... - There is favoritism. And the small group making product decisions at this time is a group of senior white men, mostly outspoken developers. If you don't think and communicate in exactly the way that this group does, you won't be listened to at this time and/or will have to put in triple or sometimes even quadruple the effort just to be listened to and trusted. Caveat here is that we've completely changed how we do work in mid-December so need to make some big decisions fast. That means that this isn't necessarily the time to listen to other points of view so we can move fast. But based on my experience working here through multiple pivots in the past year or so, I worry that it will never be a good time to listen to others... And following a strategy of only listening to the loudest in the room who can come up with an idea the fastest isn't always good business. - Leadership constantly changes direction, causing whiplash, and uses the excuse that \"this is a start-up\" to cover up the fact that it really feels like leadership doesn't knows what they're doing. This also affects your work--expect to not do the work listed in the original job posting within a month. - Culture is ambiguous at this time. A lot of people were drawn to the culture originally but, especially with lots of turnover and recent leadership changes, culture is really up in the air with no one committing to maintaining it. I don't necessarily think this is a bad thing per se but just be aware that the culture described in the handbook is not necessarily what it is now. It is in flux and leadership says they are working on it. The handbook itself has been falling behind and is a mix of up to date and out of date content. At this time, it feels like there is no culture besides the people running the show pushing things forward at all costs. This has led to stress, communication struggles, and a few toxic interactions for the entire company to see. If you interview, make sure to ask lots of questions from employees and leadership about culture, impact, expectations, etc. to make sure that it is a good fit for you. - One thing I was excited about was pay transparency and role levelling that came out a few months ago. I felt that was a good first step towards mapping out a career trajectory here at Sourcegraph. With all the changes and the pivots, I feel as if I haven't moved forward in terms of my career goals as I try to keep up with changes every other week. I'm focused more on figuring out how to best support leadership and teammates with the new plan of the week instead of just doing good work. I'm worried that this is having a negative effect on my career growth.",

Leadership called this ask \"entitlement\", others might call it the development lifecycle. - The DEI policy was removed as it was seen as \"divisive\". \"Equal opportunity\" took its place. ERG groups were told to not meet on company time or use company resources. - Favoritism abounds. The people who worked 70+ hour weeks are who were praised, awarded, saved from layoffs. I saw many get demotions for seemingly no reason in my time there. - So much cursing. Leadership curses fervently in big group meetings. Maybe they think it's cool and startup-y? It came off aggressive and forced.",

          "cons": "Sourcegraph, a decade old company, has regressed to pre-product market fit after a recent strategic and product pivot. The new flagship product lacks significant differentiated from an equivalent Microsoft product with greater distribution and comparatively infinite runway.\n\nThe majority (if not all) of the exec team is working in their largest role, and those making decisions have very little experience working in teams they do not control with absolute power. Execs have opposing goals for the company and have continuously failed to build a team that they can or are willing to place their trust in. They will micromanage down to the IC level, and spend focus on controlling things like \"woke DEI culture\" at the expense of addressing key business challenges.\n\nCommunication is majorly problematic. PeopleOps and Communications teams find themselves frequently deleting or damage-controlling messages from executives. These messages undermine morale (sometimes punching-down to particular ICs) and create unnecessary panic, sometimes involving self-aggrandizing narratives against the board. The phrase \"Psychological safety was a zero-interest rate phenomenon\" became emblematic of the company culture, especially following the first round of layoffs.\n\nThese layoffs have been a recurring theme, with at least four separate instances over the past year alone. The engineering leadership's contradictory characterizations of the individual contributors (ICs) as simultaneously 'entitled', 'under-performing', 'mis-skilled', yet 'world-class' reflect a deep-seated misalignment. This misalignment is further exacerbated by the leadership's demand for unquestioned adherence to an opaque strategy, where any attempt at seeking clarity is viewed as dissent.\n\nThe organizational structure has seen dramatic shifts. Initially, a layer of engineering directors was removed for their slow decision-making in an environment of impossible contradictory goals. More recently, a wave of new directors and department heads, predominantly from Google, were brought in, treating this Series D startup as if it operated with the culture and resources of a FAANG company. Despite these extensive changes, tangible improvements in engineering or product development haven't seemed to develop.\n\nCompounding these challenges is the absence of managers focused primarily on people management within the engineering organization. Every manager is also an individual contributor, creating a situation where managers are overburdened with dual responsibilities. This has led to a rapid turnover in management roles, with several individual contributors taking on managerial positions and reverting within a year, leaving a few with disproportionately large teams to manage.\n\nRecent calibration was particularly brutal. There is a recurring pattern of shifting goal posts and large pivots coming from left-field, and at impact review time everyone's previous quarter worth of work is judged on the vibes-du-jour instead of the goals that were set when action taking place. You can be set a goal by a one exec, then at calibration time be punished for achieving this goal by a different exec who retroactively disagrees with the goal (or was unaware of the goal, or disagreed but kept feedback to themselves until it grew to resentment).",

They have identified long-standing cultural issues within the company that have long been ignored by the reset of the exec team.\n\nHowever, the total compensation may not be sufficient to attract the top-tier AI engineers they seek.

The CEO and CTO seem really immature and short-sighted; the product is directionless; and they suddenly laid off most of the marketing team despite marketing (especially positioning) being the company's biggest problem. One major detail I can add is that in a conversation with a customer who actively liked Sourcegraph, he admitted the product was basically a vitamin and not a painkiller. In his words, he'd freak out if his CMS went down but not if Sourcegraph went down. You don't want to work for a company whose core product, even amongst its biggest fans, is a \"nice to have.\"",

If you work at Sourcegraph, you can bet your days will be full of constant stress and anxiety. One mess up or one exec who doesn't like you means you'll be booted soon enough. Recruiters will sell you on what an awesome place Sourcegraph is. They don't have first hand experience of the day to day operations and they don't know the internal dynamics that exist in the company. They're totally out of touch and will just sell you on the high base salary and cool perks. Don't be fooled.",

You can tell that the few remaining leaders are more inclined to just go along with what upper leadership wants, simply out of fear. Attrition is high. Backfills are nil. People leave and their reasoning is different than what senior leadership then tells you. Most of leadership has turned over in the past few months. Do more with less is the prevailing sentiment. People are being required to do things WAY outside their job scope, or else be managed out. There is constant talk of how things work at Amazon or google. Many current employees even left those places to escape the toxic cultures that are now being touted as supreme… and inevitable. Diversity is severely neglected.

As a result, we have incredibly high cash reserves that allows us to stay focused on building for the long-term and not having to make short-sighted decisions just to stay alive in the short-term. We are still investing in our business, we are still growing in areas that show strong returns, and I feel like if / when you can prove out an MVP you can and will get support from leadership in the form of budget and head count. We have still faced our own cuts (more on that below), but where there is momentum there is support. We are transparent. Probably to a fault. I honestly find it a little scary that I know everything about our business. All of our finances, our spending, our revenue growth is publicly available for anyone and everyone at the company. Not only that, our head of finance / ops regularly talks about our head count plans, what our forecasting numbers will look like and what will happen if we don't meet targets.

Our handbook has a stated goal to pay everyone at 75% of their job band so we pay, by definition, above market (this isn't always clean but I rarely hear anyone complain about their compensation). This also comes with high expectations that we hire great talent and pay for it. There is pressure there that isn't for everyone.",

We need good, experienced leaders in there ASAP that will be trusted and respected and listened to and seen as equals to the engineering department. We can't keep losing good people because they aren't being supported in doing things outside the limited POV of what is correct according to leadership and outspoken senior developers.",
        "cons": "- There's a lot of potential for things to go super well but any new employee beware that things are really chaotic right now. But if you're looking for a young start-up trying to figure things out, great! Just know that things do NOT feel like a mature start-up (yet) even though there's Series D funding and Sourcegraph has been around for 10 years. - If you're not a more senior engineer (and in some cases Sales), it's hard to make an impact and do good work. Lots of really smart people have left because their expertise was dismissed, especially true of the product, marketing, design, and dev/customer experience teams where we continue to see high turnover. Leadership will continually say that these people have left because of some issue like low performance or culture misfit when really theses super talented people tried many times to make an impact but were stalled at every turn. Not only does it make me distrust leadership it also makes me feel like if I struggle to succeed, it will always be my fault alone and leadership won't do any self-reflection or support me. Case in point, a lot of these recent 5 star reviews seem to be a little fake to me... You can't necessarily trust what they say... And maybe leadership is creating them to cover up more critical problems... - There is favoritism. And the small group making product decisions at this time is a group of senior white men, mostly outspoken developers. If you don't think and communicate in exactly the way that this group does, you won't be listened to at this time and/or will have to put in triple or sometimes even quadruple the effort just to be listened to and trusted. Caveat here is that we've completely changed how we do work in mid-December so need to make some big decisions fast. That means that this isn't necessarily the time to listen to other points of view so we can move fast. But based on my experience working here through multiple pivots in the past year or so, I worry that it will never be a good time to listen to others... And following a strategy of only listening to the loudest in the room who can come up with an idea the fastest isn't always good business. - Leadership constantly changes direction, causing whiplash, and uses the excuse that \"this is a start-up\" to cover up the fact that it really feels like leadership doesn't knows what they're doing. This also affects your work--expect to not do the work listed in the original job posting within a month. - Culture is ambiguous at this time. A lot of people were drawn to the culture originally but, especially with lots of turnover and recent leadership changes, culture is really up in the air with no one committing to maintaining it. I don't necessarily think this is a bad thing per se but just be aware that the culture described in the handbook is not necessarily what it is now. It is in flux and leadership says they are working on it. The handbook itself has been falling behind and is a mix of up to date and out of date content. At this time, it feels like there is no culture besides the people running the show pushing things forward at all costs. This has led to stress, communication struggles, and a few toxic interactions for the entire company to see. If you interview, make sure to ask lots of questions from employees and leadership about culture, impact, expectations, etc. to make sure that it is a good fit for you. - One thing I was excited about was pay transparency and role levelling that came out a few months ago. I felt that was a good first step towards mapping out a career trajectory here at Sourcegraph. With all the changes and the pivots, I feel as if I haven't moved forward in terms of my career goals as I try to keep up with changes every other week. I'm focused more on figuring out how to best support leadership and teammates with the new plan of the week instead of just doing good work. I'm worried that this is having a negative effect on my career growth.",

SteveY only cares about the technical side of things but seems to be calling all the shots. Take a serious look in the mirror - did recent opt-out opportunities actually move Sourcegraph toward the culture you want to create? Do you even know what that culture is? Why were opt-outs in prod/engineering disproportionately female relative to the rest of prod/engineering? Define the culture you actual want, and why, and make decisions accordingly. The company is far too directionless, which is a real shame because the product is awesome. Who are you? Who do you want to be? How will you get there? Continue to be fully transparent with new hires about the challenges and opportunities. Obviously the recent spike in reviews tells you company culture change is happening and acknowledged internally - how will you position that to candidates?",
        "cons": "Sourcegraph is making a conscious effort to change it's culture by encouraging people to be \"scrappy,\" operate in ambiguity, and by discouraging \"Entitlement\" to information about company direction, and the \"why\" behind decisions. Within this change in culture, there exists great opportunity for individuals who are looking for opportunities to make big impact and advance quickly in their careers by taking on a ton of responsibility. This is a founder-led organization, where the founders expect everyone to give as much time and effort possible to Sourcegraph - they are understandably completely invested in the product and expect the same of Teammates. You will be expected to embrace The Grind of start up life.. You will feel like you have to be responsive at all times because \"asynchronous\" culture results in a lot of evening, weekend, and holiday work (BTW many roles are pulled into tons of meetings). It's important to understand what \"be flexible\" means in the context of a lot of these reviews - be ready for quick changes in direction, because there is a serious lack of commitment to long-term plans. The 30 day minimum PTO requirement is great, in theory, but not enforced or monitored in any way. Lastly, despite being a high performer (and rewarded as such), I felt this was a place where the consequences of making a mistake were high, particularly when interacting with senior leadership. I witnessed individuals very abruptly go from being valued contributors to sidelined. Most top performers do not have families, and those who do have a partner that does care taking. Ask questions during the interview process about what's important to you - you will get straightforward answers from most hiring managers. Know that \"scrappy\" is code for working a lot, \"high performance culture\" means taking direction well, and being \"flexible\" equates to frequently changing direction or doing things very last-minute based on arbitrary deadlines.",

Depending on your team, the PTO policy is good (depending on role, expect to check in on slack/email/get texts on occasion while on vacation, though). There is a huge opportunity here for people willing to devote a ton of their lives to work - and leadership is making intentional steps to foster that environment. The handbook is awesome, and internal processes are documented well, although it can be information overload. The company uses Slack heavily (a pro, in my book, provided you are comfortable with wading through large amounts of information and being tagged in tons of CYA-type posts). I did not appreciate the culture shift that happened after I joined, where leadership doesn't care about people who were good at their jobs choosing to leave, so I left quickly myself. I'm great at what I do and therefore do not need to work for a company that doesn't value good management, promotes competition between team members, and doesn't respect work/life boundaries. But, on the flip side, I learned a TON and had the opportunity to work on a lot of cool stuff - that's why this is in the pros. Also, most of the people I worked with were genuinely awesome.

My manager would then take time to critique my slack message with suggestions on how I could shorten it in the future. \r\n\r\n* Half-hearted attempt at diversity: There is a real desire to foster DEI as part of the culture, but I never felt like it was really executed on while I was there. There were things they did well (hiring across the world &amp; pay equity) but also lot of areas where it fell short.\r\n\r\n Examples of how it fell short: Very clique-ish culture. A primarily white/male dominated environment when I was there, in particular, most of the managers and leaders were white and/or male. Their recruiting team is not diverse, which is odd to me if you're making a push to hire for diversity. There was no official DEI group or any ERGs to create community.

I'm not surprised they have now chosen the *brilliant* idea to pivot into the ai coding assistant space, once again putting it in a struggle against Github's robust and impressively developed Copilot. \r\n\r\nA lot of these pivots were made to try to gain traction somewhere, anywhere, and in my opinion is partially due to a disconnect between product and engineering.

        "cons": "Sourcegraph, a decade old company, has regressed to pre-product market fit after a recent strategic and product pivot. The new flagship product lacks significant differentiated from an equivalent Microsoft product with greater distribution and comparatively infinite runway.\n\nThe majority (if not all) of the exec team is working in their largest role, and those making decisions have very little experience working in teams they do not control with absolute power. Execs have opposing goals for the company and have continuously failed to build a team that they can or are willing to place their trust in. They will micromanage down to the IC level, and spend focus on controlling things like \"woke DEI culture\" at the expense of addressing key business challenges.\n\nCommunication is majorly problematic. PeopleOps and Communications teams find themselves frequently deleting or damage-controlling messages from executives. These messages undermine morale (sometimes punching-down to particular ICs) and create unnecessary panic, sometimes involving self-aggrandizing narratives against the board. The phrase \"Psychological safety was a zero-interest rate phenomenon\" became emblematic of the company culture, especially following the first round of layoffs.\n\nThese layoffs have been a recurring theme, with at least four separate instances over the past year alone. The engineering leadership's contradictory characterizations of the individual contributors (ICs) as simultaneously 'entitled', 'under-performing', 'mis-skilled', yet 'world-class' reflect a deep-seated misalignment. This misalignment is further exacerbated by the leadership's demand for unquestioned adherence to an opaque strategy, where any attempt at seeking clarity is viewed as dissent.\n\nThe organizational structure has seen dramatic shifts. Initially, a layer of engineering directors was removed for their slow decision-making in an environment of impossible contradictory goals. More recently, a wave of new directors and department heads, predominantly from Google, were brought in, treating this Series D startup as if it operated with the culture and resources of a FAANG company. Despite these extensive changes, tangible improvements in engineering or product development haven't seemed to develop.\n\nCompounding these challenges is the absence of managers focused primarily on people management within the engineering organization. Every manager is also an individual contributor, creating a situation where managers are overburdened with dual responsibilities. This has led to a rapid turnover in management roles, with several individual contributors taking on managerial positions and reverting within a year, leaving a few with disproportionately large teams to manage.\n\nRecent calibration was particularly brutal. There is a recurring pattern of shifting goal posts and large pivots coming from left-field, and at impact review time everyone's previous quarter worth of work is judged on the vibes-du-jour instead of the goals that were set when action taking place. You can be set a goal by a one exec, then at calibration time be punished for achieving this goal by a different exec who retroactively disagrees with the goal (or was unaware of the goal, or disagreed but kept feedback to themselves until it grew to resentment).",
        "lengthOfEmployment": 4,
        "pros": "The company offers a reasonable base pay and promotes unlimited paid time off (PTO). The newest executive team member shows promise, bringing a unique blend of technical and leadership skills which seems to be a rarity at this level at Sourcegraph. They have identified long-standing cultural issues within the company that have long been ignored by the reset of the exec team.\n\nHowever, the total compensation may not be sufficient to attract the top-tier AI engineers they seek. The culture around impact reviews tends to undermine the practicality of the unlimited PTO policy. Additionally, while the new executive's awareness of cultural issues is a positive step, the depth and complexity of these problems make significant improvements challenging.",

        "advice": "To the Sourcegraph management, particularly the CEO: It's impressive to see a CEO with the highest commit rate in the whole company, but it might be time to leverage this enthusiasm differently. While your GitHub commit rate is impressive, delegating this task to your development team might be more beneficial. With the company at a crucial stage, your time and expertise could be more impactful in addressing strategic issues and steering the company towards success.\n\nFor the CTO: The key to great software development lies in a strong, well-supported team. Reflecting on the consistent feedback in these reviews could be enlightening. This introspection may help fine-tune your leadership approach, enhancing team dynamics and contributing positively to Sourcegraph’s trajectory.\n\nTo the ever-evolving leadership team at Sourcegraph: As you navigate your new roles, be mindful that job security has been a recurring challenge within the company. It's crucial not to take any outcomes personally. Numerous highly skilled predecessors have faced similar situations. Stay positive but honest, give it your best, and remember that the outcome is more about the company's ongoing dynamics than a measure of your individual talents. Wishing you the best of luck in your endeavors.",
        "cons": "I wanted to share some real talk about my time at Sourcegraph, especially since you might be considering a role there. It's always good to go in with both eyes open, right?\n\nThe work environment at Sourcegraph isn't just a mixed bag; it presents considerable challenges. They've made a strategic pivot recently, but that's only part of the story. The leadership team has been completely overhauled multiple times in just two years. It's tough to have any confidence in the longevity of the current leadership when you've seen their predecessors shown the door one after the other. Initially, these changes brought a sense of hope, but by the third round, it's hard not to feel a bit sorry for the new leaders who are trying their best - just like the last ones did.\n\nRegarding the executive team, to put it simply, they lack experience. There's a palpable sense of internal strife, almost like they're participants in their own version of the Hunger Games, each afraid of being the next to go. This atmosphere of uncertainty doesn't lead to outright micromanagement, but something perhaps more frustrating. Often, you'll receive vague directives like \"make it better\" without clear guidance on what that actually means. If you dare to ask for clarification, you risk being labeled as entitled. And remember, how you interpret and act on these vague instructions will come back around in your impact reviews, which I'll get into a bit more later.\n\nJob security is a significant concern. Layoffs have become a recurring theme, not just an occasional blip. It's happened several times over the last two years alone. With the management structure in constant flux, you never really feel settled. It's like standing on shifting sands, always unsure of where you stand or who you'll report to next or if they will even be left around by the next review cycle.\n\nNow, let's talk about the impact reviews. Sourcegraph has been around for a decade, so they're far from a startup. The real issue is that they're struggling to find a way to significantly increase revenue to finally IPO. The CEO and CTO seem to be out of fresh ideas, so there's this pressure on employees to come up with million-dollar ideas - or to “make it better” 😉. If you don't come up with something that substantially boosts the bottom line, you're labeled as not making an impact, putting you at risk of being in the next round of layoffs which always seem to be just around the corner. Even if you do come up with a great idea, it gets absorbed by the top brass, and then it's back to square one - you need another big idea, increase your commit rate (which gets judged at impact reviews) or go back to helping endless new hires, new management, and customer success team navigate a tech stack that's been left hollow by the departure of the many skilled devs that owned them but have left due to layoffs or attrition and hope that they perceive those efforts as impactful.\n\nIn short, while there are some perks like fair pay, the overall environment is fraught with peril, from unstable leadership and job insecurity to a high-pressure culture around million dollar feature ideas. It's a lot to take on, and I just wanted you to know what you might be getting into.\n\nWishing you the best in your job search and career. Take care!",

Since then, there has been no sense of safety or longevity. You clock in each day with the idea that it could be your last.\n\nThe smartest leaders were shown the door, and the ones that kept their jobs were the loyalists to the exec suite's ideas, no matter how weak or deranged. The exec suite thought it was a good idea to change what we sold and for how much every few months, then berated teams for not hitting quota (which was next to impossible when there was no direction). \n\nThis environment quickly spiraled in to the Hunger Games. Exec meetings became tense and the ICs felt the trickle down as managers threw their own people under the bus. The calibration cycle almost a year ago was incredibly brutal, built solely on an agenda to make as many top performers quit as possible to save some cash. \n\nWhat used to make this place worthwhile (location-agnostic pay, work-life balance) doesn't exist anymore. Instead, you'll join a company that gets off on backstabbing, steamrolling, and punishment. The bad managers do nothing but gaslight and indulge in toxicity with their direct reports. They play favorites and if you're not in the \"in\" club, you'll be shown the pink slip soon enough. The ones that \"succeed\" here are the \"yes\" men (and yes, it is mostly men since DEI isn't a priority anymore) and the ones that are willing to put their health, mental state, and/or personal life on the line in order to get ahead for a company that will quickly lose the AI race to any number of stronger giants. Working late nights and weekends is the rule, not the exception, but they'll lead with their \"work from anywhere\" culture in interviews to make it seem reasonable. \n\nIt does not matter if you've been successful at Sourcegraph or have hit your goals consistently quarter after quarter. If they decide that they don't like you, you'll be gaslit, punished, and eventually pushed to leave.\n\nThey hire some of the smartest people that I've ever met, but they abuse them to the point that the best friends I made at Sourcegraph were due to trauma bonding together.",

      "# [Sourcegraph went dark](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41296481)\nThanks for being a fan. And I understand it's a bummer to not have our code be public and open-source anymore. Sorry.\n\nIt's a bunch of reasons that add up. I'll give some more details for anyone curious.\n\n(And I know that despite these reasons, lots of HNers probably wish it was not so. I agree! I too wish for a world where all companies could have their code be public and open source.)\n\n- We have a lot of tech around large-scale code graph, indexing, etc., stuff that is very differentiated and hard to build. We were starting to put some of this in separate private repositories and link them in at build time, but that was complex. It added a lot of code complexity, risked bugs, and slowed us down, and if a lot of the awesome stuff was private anyway, what was the point?\n\n- As we've been building Cody (https://cody.dev), our code AI tool, we've seen a LOT more abuse. That's what happens when you offer any free tier of a product with LLM inference. We had to move a lot more of our internal backend abuse logic to private repositories, and it added code complexity to incorporate that private stuff in at build time.\n\n- It confused devs and customers to have 2 releases: an open-source release with less scaley/enterprisey features, and an enterprise release. It was a pain to migrate from one to the other (GitLab also felt this pain with their product) because the open-source build had a subset of the DB schema and other things. It was confusing to have a free tier on the enterprise release (lots of people got that mixed up with the open-source release), and it made our pricing and packaging complex so that lots of our time was spent helping customers understand what is paid and what isn't.\n\n- There were actually very very few companies that were going to pay but then decided to use the open-source version and not pay us. A lot of people probably assume that's why we made this move, but it's not. I think this is because people like the product and see value in it, including all the large-scale code nav/search features that are in our enterprise version.\n\n- Although very very few companies used our open-source version to avoid paying us, we did see it cause a lot of annoyance for devs who were asked by their management to try cloning our product or to research our codebase to give their procurement team ammunition to negotiate down our price. This honestly was just a waste of everyone's time.\n\n- If we got a ton of contributions (we never really solicited any), then it might've changed the calculus. Sourcegraph is an end-user application that you use at work (and when fun-coding, but the primary revenue model is for us to charge companies). For various reason, end-user server-side applications just don't get nearly as many contributions. Maybe it's because you'd need to redeploy your build for a bunch of other users at your company, not just yourself. Maybe it's because they necessarily entail UX, frontend, and scaling stuff, in addition to just adding new features.\n\n- We heard from people who left GitHub that people at GitHub were frequently monitoring our repository to get wind of our upcoming features and launches. Someone from GitHub told me his \"job is to clone Sourcegraph\". Since then, they obviously deprioritized their code search to re-found GitHub on AI, so we're not seeing this threat anymore. But I didn't love giving Microsoft an unfair advantage, especially since GitHub products are not open source either.\n\n- Since we made our code non-open-source, we've been able to pursue a lot more big partnerships (e.g., with cloud providers and other distribution partners and resellers). This is a valuable revenue stream that helps us make a better product overall. Again, because Sourcegraph is an end-user application with a UI that devs constantly use and care about, we never really had the MongoDB/Redis/CockroachDB risk of AWS/GCP/Azure just deploying our stuff and cutting us out. We're not protecting from downside here, but we are enjoying the upside because now those kinds of distribution partnerships are viable for us. To give a specific example, within ~2 months of making our code non-open-source last year, we signed a $1M+ ARR deal through a distribution partner that would not have happened if our code was open source. This is not our biggest annual deal, but it's still really nice!\n\nWe are totally focused on building the best code search/intelligence and appreciate all our customers and all the feedback here. Hope this helps explain a bit more where we're coming from!\n\nI don't see any attempt to veil it -- there was specific mention of revenue and competitors\n\nDid SourceGraph make any promises about a community or free support? (honest question)\n\nI think your expectations may be off, perhaps learned from corporate marketing. \"Open source\" by itself does not mean necessarily\n\n1. you get any support\n\n2. there is a community [1]\n\n3. you're entitled to all future source code by that person or company, whether under the same project name or not.\n\n---\n\nIt could be that SourceGraph has broken some promises, and that IS pretty typical of VC-backed companies.\n\nBut so far I don't see evidence of that.\n\nQuoting my comment: https://lobste.rs/s/tg5vwi/sourcegraph_went_dark#c_vnaqxu\n\nEven according to Stallman, free software never required any kind of support, open development, or commit history. You can publish a tarball on a web server, and that counts as free software.\n\ni.e. publishing source code doesn’t sign you up for a lifelong obligation. People can fork it, or not fork it.\n\n---\n\nPractically speaking, I might think of SourceGraph as something like Android.\n\nIs Android open source? Yes. [2]\n\nDoes it have huge proprietary parts? Yes.\n\nIt is designed for collaborative development? Not really unless you work for a big company, and are paid to work on Android. (That said, I'm sure there are hobbyists / \"people in their basement\" that do meaningful things with Android source code -- and actually I think that is how some open phone companies started)\n\nIs it better than it's open rather than closed? Yes. Multiple competitors to Google use Android source code, e.g. Amazon has built phones off of it. That is good thing IMO.\n\n---\n\n[1] On my own open source projects, there is a community and best-effort support, and I really encourage that! But the point is that there are MULTIPLE valid project models under the name \"open source\".\n\nThrowing code over the wall is actually valid open source, and it actually benefits society IMO. It's still valuable, even if you STOP doing it, as SourceGraph has done.\n\nIt's distinct from \"I get free stuff that I like using\"\n\nThere could be a different name for \"unfunded or independently funded open source\", but the funny thing is that the term \"open source\" originated as a corporate-friendly alternative to \"free software\"\n\n[2] As a tangent, I also think Android has a really suboptimal and cloud-slanted architecture, but for this discussion, let's just use it as a an example of corporate open source",

      "# [Efficient scaleups in 2024 vs 2021: Sourcegraph (with CEO & Co by Gergely Orosz on 2024-10-09](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/quinn-slack-efficient-scalups)\nThe Pragmatic Engineer Podcast had a very warm reception with the first episode — thank you! Two weeks later, here is episode #2, with a CEO who still codes every day: Quinn Slack at Sourcegraph.\n\nListen now on Apple, Spotify, and YouTube.\n\nBrought to you by:\n\n• Paragon: ​​Build native, customer-facing SaaS integrations 7x faster.\n\n• Enterprise Ready Conferfence on 30 October: For product and engineering leaders shaping the future if enterprise SaaS.\n\nOn today’s episode of The Pragmatic Engineer, I’m joined by Quinn Slack, CEO and co-founder of Sourcegraph, a leading code search and intelligence platform. Quinn holds a degree in Computer Science from Stanford and is deeply passionate about coding: to the point that he still codes every day! He also serves on the board of Hack Club, a national nonprofit dedicated to bringing coding clubs to high schools nationwide. In this insightful conversation, we discuss:\n\nHow Sourcegraph's operations have evolved since 2021\n\nWhy more software engineers should focus on delivering business value\n\nWhy Quinn continues to code every day, even as a CEO\n\nPractical AI and LLM use cases and a phased approach to their adoption\n\nThe story behind Job Fairs at Sourcegraph and why it’s no longer in use\n\nQuinn’s leadership style and his focus on customers and product excellence\n\nThe shift from location-independent pay to zone-based pay at Sourcegraph\n\nAnd much more!\n\nTakeaways\n\nSome of my main takeaways from this conversation are these.\n\n1. As software engineers, it’s increasingly important to understand what value you add to the business. A big difference between 2021 and 2024 is how companies are much more focused on efficiency: meaning they are hiring more conservatively, and less likely to fund teams with headcount that don’t contribute to the core focus of the company.\n\nAs a developer or manager, try to figure out how much your team contributes in revenue, or savings, or other key goals to the company. Are you working in what the company would consider as a profit center, or what is more as a cost center? We did a deepdive on this topic in The Pragmatic Engineer: check out the article, linked in the show notes.\n\n2. AI tools are great to eliminate the toil that we, developers face, day-to-day. There are AI tools that position themselves as their goal being “replacing developers.” I found it sympathetic that Quinn did not think this is the sensible path. His approach is to start by using AI tools with some of the “dumbest things” like generating the changelog for a software release – I mean, assuming you generate a changelog. And then you take tedious tasks where these tools could help, and see if you can automate some more.\n\nDo this one step at a time: and it will actually help devs and teams, and it’s a lot more achievable than saying “let’s replace this whole complicated workflow with AI.”\n\n3. The reality of location independent pay is that it stops being sensible above a certain company size. Sourcegraph was one of the few companies that offered the same base salary regardless of where people worked at. They did this until they grew to about 200 people, and switched this model to a location-indexed model.\n\nQuinn was honest about why they did it: because keeping this would have not made sense for the company, from the business point of view. Basically, location-independent pay means the company can hire very easily in low-cost regions, but it’s hard or impossible to do this in high-cost regions. It also creates the incentive for employees to move to a low cost region where they can save more. In the end, I don’t know of any company with more than 200 people that pays location-independent: all large companies have some kind of indexing on location, and the best companies just pay the top of the local market. We cover more about compensation in the deepdive on The trimodal nature of software engineering salaries.\n\nIf you enjoy the podcast, I’d very much appreciate if you subscribe on your favorite podcast player, and leave a review.

      "# [founder complains open source means \"extra work and risk\" • DEVCLASS by Tim Anderson on 2024-08-21](https://devclass.com/2024/08/21/sourcegraph-makes-core-repository-private-co-founder-complains-open-source-means-extra-work-and-risk/)\nSourcegraph has removed the formerly open source core repository for its popular code search product from public view – with CEO and co-founder Quinn Slack saying open source makes little sense for “full server-side end-user applications” and adds “extra work and risk”.\n\nEric Fritz, a former Sourcegraph engineer, posted about the implications of the change, complaining about broken links (impacting his work for the Sourcegraph engineering blog) as well as what he sees as the end of a culture of building “100% in the open”.\n\nSlack engaged in a discussion on Hacker News, saying: “we made our main internal codebase (for our code search product) private. We did this to focus. It added a lot of extra work and risk to have stuff be open source and public.” He added that open source “could make sense for a lot of companies” but only for “infrastructure products or client tools,” not server code for end-user applications.\n\nThat is a change of heart since 2018 when Slack posted that Sourcegraph was now open source under the Apache license, though additional enterprise features remained closed source. “We opened up Sourcegraph to bring code search and intelligence to more developers and developer ecosystems,” Slack said. Further goals were to “make basic code intelligence ubiquitous” for every language and IDE, and to increase the amount and quality of open source code.\n\nThe closing of Sourcegraph code began in June 2023 when the company relicensed much of the code to an enterprise license instead of Apache, but stated that “the source code will remain publicly available.”\n\nSlack now says that the code will no longer be public, though there is a public snapshot of the repository just before it became private. Slack gave reasons for the change including keeping “very differentiated” code secret, hiding code intended to prevent abuse, and that removing the open source license enabled new revenue streams with cloud providers and other resellers.\n\nHe also reckons the company got little benefit from external contributions to the code, claiming that “end-user server-side applications just don’t get nearly as many contributions” as other types of project. The implication is that for Sourcegraph, open source introduced extra work and risk but without the mitigation of getting improved code via unpaid contributors.\n\nAmazon Web Services had a public dispute with Elastic over its use of the formerly open source Elasticsearch product. In 2021, AWS introduced OpenSearch, based on Elasticsearch 7.10, and stated that the project had “a rich roadmap of new and innovative functionality.” Perhaps Slack had this in mind, since he said that even if 60 percent of Sourcegraph Code Search was open source, and 40 percent closed, then “distribution partners have outsized incentives and capacity to reimplement the subset of the 40 percent that they think their market needs.”\n\nPublic code is used for training AI models that then propose code to developers via coding assistants – including Sourcegraph’s Cody, which remains open source under the Apache 2.0 license. Removing code from public view is therefore not good for coding assistants. Nor is it good for public code search services, one of which is operated by Sourcegraph.\n\nA developer complained that this public index has been “silently destroyed … it seems that all GitLab repos are gone from the index and a huge number of GitHub repos as well.”\n\nSlack replied that the index still includes almost a million repositories but that many had been removed because “it was very complex to keep up with millions of repositories due to GitHub rate limits and scaling.” In particular, repositories with few GitHub stars have been removed.",
      "# [Issues with Cody Not Finding Relevant Files Compared to Cursor on 2024-08-19](https://community.sourcegraph.com/t/issues-with-cody-not-finding-relevant-files-compared-to-cursor/908)\nI just want to let the developers know that I’m getting “empty” results in terms of file numbers when asking questions that Cursor can easily handle. For example, when I ask something like, “Where is the movement system for characters in this game?” Cursor successfully identifies the main Movement script along with several other related scripts. However, Cody fails to find any relevant files and instead provides explanations based on the project name, without identifying the actual files. This isn’t an isolated issue—it’s the same for any other questions I ask. Because of this, I’ve completely stopped using Cody for navigating my codebase.\n\nJust to clarify, in case it matters: my projects are Unity projects with 10-200 scripts, many folders, and a functioning Codyignore file (which excludes plenty of folders and files). I know the ignore file is working because Cody doesn’t interact with the ignored files.\n\nI’m open to the possibility that my issues are caused by an unstable Codyignore, but when I see articles like this one (Chat-oriented programming (CHOP) in action), “Let’s ask something a little more complex - such as how would I add a new LLM model to our Cody VS Code extension.” - I’m amazed that I can’t achieve anything even remotely similar. I’m curious if the developers are aware of these issues and if they are being worked on, or if I’m the only one experiencing this?\n\nHi there!\n\nWhile trying to take a screenshot, I managed to narrow down the issue a bit.\n\nA lot of it has to do with the language used for the query. When using Cursor, I’m used to making queries in a language other than English, and this usually doesn’t cause any issues. With Cody, things at least start working when I make queries in English (in both blended and embeddings modes). This partially resolves the problem for me… But an automatic translation of the query into English (which seems to be critical) would be much more convenient for many users whose native language is not English.\n\nWhat practically doesn’t work at all (or works strangely) in any language is the “Keyword” context mode. I noticed something else during testing: in this mode, it’s critical not to place punctuation marks immediately after the last letter. I’m attaching two screenshots in this mode. In one of them, the question mark is attached to the last word (and the chat can’t find any files), while in the other, it’s not (apparently, this is the correct way to search, but how would a user know this?)—and the chat finds a file, but it’s the wrong one! And that’s odd—it’s clear from the screenshot that I have a file with that name, which contains a class with that name. But Cody suggests a different file for some reason.\n\nRegarding the embeddings mode, as I found out earlier, it generally works in English. And I could probably rely on it. But there are two important nuances, especially the second one, which makes it difficult to do so, unlike with Cursor:\n\n3.1. First, Cody indexes everything, the entire project. In my case (a Unity game), it indexes 1000 times more than necessary, ignoring the ignore file. I’m not sure if this is good for subsequent efficiency, but I hope that during the queries, the ignore file will at least help avoid distractions. In any case, indexing a new project can take 20-30 minutes. I tried switching to the pre-release version (v1.31.1724080603), and maybe I misunderstood something, but it seems like no indexing happens at all in that version.\n\n3.2. More importantly, the indexing frequency. In Cursor, it happens every 10 minutes and can be initiated manually. Considering that the ignore file is taken into account there, it only takes a few seconds. When the indexing of updates happens in Cody, I don’t understand at all. Sometimes something significant changes in the project within minutes, and waiting for it for weeks (or however long it takes) seems strange. I know that you can delete the corresponding files for re-indexing, but then you’ll have to wait another 30 minutes.\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time on these experiments and descriptions for you, and I hope that this helps improve something.\n\n.\n\n!/.cody\n\n!.ignore\n\n!/Assets/\n\n/Assets/*\n\n!/Assets/Scripts/\n\n!.txt\n\n!.cs",

      "# [Sourcegraph revolutionizes product development with Claude AI: Transforming user feedback into action](https://www.anthropic.com/news/sourcegraph-claude-for-work)\nSourcegraph is a code intelligence company that builds tools for developers to search and navigate code across an entire codebase. Sourcegraph uses Claude to power its AI Coding assistant, Cody. And now, Sourcegraph is using Claude for Work to transform community feedback into actionable insights for their product team.\n\nWith Claude, Sourcegraph efficiently:\n\nAccelerates community feedback analysis\n\nIncreases product team's responsiveness to user needs\n\nSimplifies competitor sentiment analysis\n\nSynthesizing community feedback for product development\n\nSourcegraph helps developers search, understand, and automate changes across large codebases. With a focus on open-source sustainability and community engagement, the company needed to efficiently process and action feedback from their diverse user base.\n\nJustin Dorfman, Open Source Community Manager at Sourcegraph explains, \"there was a disconnect between the community and our product team. To reduce churn and increase retention, we need to listen to our customers. They're crucial for gauging developers' use of AI, which informs our enterprise offerings.\"\n\nChoosing Claude\n\nSourcegraph chose Claude for its superior output quality, comprehension, consistency and reliability. “Claude has been an absolute game-changer. It just feels and listens better. All we need to do is choose a Project, upload a PDF, and Claude outputs a structured report in seconds. Claude gets it 95% of the way there, and then our team adds final refinements before sending the report to the product managers,” says Dorfman.\n\nSourcegraph uses Claude to synthesize and analyze the vast amounts of community feedback they collect. They’ve incorporated Claude into key workflows:\n\nWeekly community feedback reports: Claude processes data from various sources to generate comprehensive reports for the product team.\n\nCompetitor sentiment dashboard: Sourcegraph created a dashboard using Claude to track and compare user sentiment across competitors.\n\nDorfman elaborates, \"With Claude, we can condense data down to make sure we’re not missing anything. It gives our teams a high-level view while still allowing us to link directly to specific feedback sources. This makes our work more strategic and enables our teams to create higher impact work.\"\n\nAccelerating time to value\n\nBy integrating Claude into their feedback analysis workflow, Sourcegraph has made improvements across multiple areas of their business. By automating much of their feedback process, Claude has freed up employees to focus on high-value tasks and take action on insights quickly, increasing overall productivity.\n\nWith Claude’s analysis, Sourcegraph is able to identify and address regional performance feedback, leading to more tailored solutions for their global user base. This approach has contributed to improved customer satisfaction and retention through faster issue resolution.\n\nClaude has also created a feedback loop between community input and product development. This cycle ensures that Sourcegraph's products continue to evolve in line with user needs and expectations.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nSourcegraph plans to further integrate Claude for Work across their teams and into their workflows. They seek to explore new AI capabilities, strengthen their partnership with Anthropic, and continue focusing on open-source sustainability and community engagement.\n\nWhen reflecting on what's next, Dorfman adds, \"we look forward to pushing the limits of Claude 3.5 Sonnet to deliver high-value action items for our product team. This will improve the chat-oriented programming experience for Sourcegraph customers.\"",

      "# [Sourcegraph launches AI coding assistant Cody into general availability by Kyt Dotson, MARIA DEUTSCHER, PAUL GILLIN, ROBERT HOF, JAMES FARRELL on 2023-12-14](https://siliconangle.com/2023/12/14/sourcegraph-launches-ai-coding-assistant-cody-general-availability/)\nSourcegraph Inc., a startup best known for developing a universal code search tool, today announced it’s releasing the company’s generative artificial intelligence-powered chatbot coding assistant Cody into general availability.\n\nWith Cody, developers get an AI assistant that uses intelligent code context to provide answers to technical questions, provide code completion in editors, generate code blocks, provide test cases and more.\n\nWhat separates Cody from other AI assistants in the market is that the chatbot is aware of more than just the code in the file the developer is looking at or a single repository. It can search and navigate a company’s entire codebase using Sourcegraph’s specialized technology.\n\nIn an interview with SiliconANGLE, co-founder and Chief Executive Quinn Slack said that because the company started with code search, it’s exactly that foundation that set it on the course to prepare Cody to make it as useful and aware as it is.\n\n“To build code search, we had to build a deep understanding of code,” he said. “And with advances in AI, we can take that deep understanding and feed it to the AI to help it understand questions, autocomplete better or write tests better. Overall, that’s what’s making Cody the most powerful and accurate AI available and we’re the first to connect an AI to this code context.”\n\nThe company’s name itself, Sourcegraph, refers to a knowledge graph of the code, which provides a crucial context-aware source of information for both the AI and developers when it comes to the code.\n\nCody is currently available as an editor extension for Visual Studio Code in general availability. The AI assistant is also available in JetBrains editors and Neovim in beta mode, and can be enabled in Sourcegraph’s Code Search engine. It provides both code completion within the editor and a chatbot experience on the side, where users can ask questions and it will generate code snippets or complete, built functions that take in the entire context of their codebase.\n\nWhen a user asks Cody a technical question about their codebase, it uses Sourcegraph’s knowledge context to go through a company’s repository of code and understands the underlying information there to provide a conversational response to questions. That means users no longer need to write out technical search strings to find functions or source references.\n\nEvery reply from Cody about code search also comes with a series of references from the codebase that provides deeper context related to the technical question that allows the developer to dive directly into the code. So if developers ask a question about how a function operates or about an app in their codebase, Cody can give them an easy-to-read explanation of what it is, alongside a series of references from the codebase that they can then use to find exactly where to see find dependencies and elements in the code itself.\n\n“Sometimes these context links are just as helpful as the answer it gives because I can actually go and dig into the source of truth, the primary source material,” said Slack.\n\nDevelopers can also update Cody with custom commands, making its functionality extendable, with custom LLM prompts that fit their workflows. For example, they can prompt the AI assistant to write commit messages for them to summarize code changes between two open tabs to reduce tedium, or ask Cody to compare the open tabs. That allows developers to create commands for Cody that they do often, reducing overall toil in their everyday work.\n\nTo make sure customers aren’t beholden to one generative AI provider, customers can choose the large language model that powers Cody, which can include Anthropic’s Claude 2.1 and OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo. Developers can also choose from a different LLM provider through Microsoft Corp.’s Azure and Amazon Web Services Inc.’s Bedrock.\n\nAccording to Slack, deep code context is only the beginning. In the future, Cody should be able to see everything related to the developer stack and assist across the entire workflow.\n\n“We don’t want to stop there,” Slack said. “And the really exciting thing is how can we get all the information that a human developer knows and bring that into the AI? For example, bringing in information from Confluence, Splunk, Datadog and Jira so that Cody can answer a question about how to fix an error. All of this data is critical. There’s way more of that data than there is in code and no human could do their job without it.”\n\nAs for now, Cody is available for free for individual developers for local context only, with monthly limits on autocomplete and chat. There is also a Cody Pro pricing tier available at $9 per user per month with no monthly limits and allows users to choose their LLM provider, which is free to use until February. A Cody Enterprise tier will be available in early 2024.\n\nImage: Sourcegraph",
      "# [Sourcegraph went dark on 2024-08-19](https://eric-fritz.com/articles/sourcegraph-went-dark/)\nTowards the end of my mid-2019 job search, I was down to joining the Google Go team or Sourcegraph. Sourcegraph ultimately won due to cultural factors - the most important of which was the ability to build 100% in the open. All documents were public by default. Technical and product RFCs (and later PR/FAQs) were drafted, reviewed, and catalogued in a public Google Drive folder. All product implementation was done in public GitHub repositories.\n\nToday, the sourcegraph/sourcegraph repository went private. This is the final cleaving blow, following many other smaller chops, on the culture that made Sourcegraph an attractive place to work. It’s a decision for a business from which I resigned, and therefore have no voice. But I still lament the rocky accessibility of artifacts showing four years of genuine effort into a product that I loved (and miss the use of daily in my current role).\n\nOn the bright side, I’ve cemented my place on the insights leaderboard for the remainder of time.\n\nKeeping references alive\n\nOver my tenure at Sourcegraph I’ve done a fair bit of writing for the engineering blog, which I’ve inlined into this website for stable reference. It’s interesting to see what people are trying to build and, for an engineer, how they’re trying to build it. Much of my writing used links into relevant public code as a reference.\n\nAll of these links are now broken.\n\nThere’s a common saying that cool URIs don’t change. In a related sense, I have the hot take that cool articles don’t suddenly start rotting links. I’m going to break at least one of these best practices, and I can’t do anything about the first one. So I’ll attempt to preserve as much information in this writing as possible by moving these links into a repository under my influence.\n\nI'm opting to bite the bullet now and move references to something completely under my control rather than kick then can down the road by referencing another repository that _could_ suddenly disappear at any time.\n\nI had a feeling this would be a risk a while ago, so I had forked sourcegraph/sourcegraph into efritz/sourcegraph in preparation. Given the fork, it should be easy enough job to do a global find-and-replace of one repository name with another at this point and mission accomplished, right?\n\nUnfortunately, no. I had links to code on the main branch, but also links to pull requests and commits within pull requests. Forks don’t inherit pull requests (problem #1). And commits not directly referenced by a branch of your fork are visible as only as long as they’re part of the repository network (problem #2).\n\nI had wondered what happens to forks when a repository is deleted or changes visibility and found some calming information in the official GitHub documentation:\n\nIn other words, a public repository’s forks will remain public in their own separate repository network even after the upstream repository is made private. This allows the fork owners to continue to work and collaborate without interruption. […] If a public repository is made private and then deleted, its public forks will continue to exist in a separate network.\n\nMy fork will continue to exist (yay), but the source repository becoming inaccessible might take commits outside of the main branch with it. I need to ensure that these commits are part of the new repository network.\n\nScraping for relevant commits\n\nStep one is to find all the commits I care about. I ran the following Go program to iterate through all of my pull requests on the source repository and write their payloads to disk for further processing.\n\nThis program yielded 2,645 files with pull request metadata. I then used jq to read these JSON payloads and extract data for subsequent steps.\n\nThis script creates three files:\n\npr_ids.txt is a flat list of GitHub identifiers, which are used in URLs. Since the list endpoint returns only enough data to render a pull request list, we’ll need to fetch additional information (intermediate commits) for each pull request by its ID.\n\ncommits.txt is a flat list of git SHAs that were a result of merging a PR into the target branch (not always main). These commits may or may not be in the forked repository network, depending on the merge target. These should be synced over.\n\nreplace_pairs.txt contains pairs of of pull request identifier and its merge commit. This will later be used to mass replace /pull/{id} with /commit/{sha}. Since pull requests can’t be linked directly anymore, I can at least link to the full pull request contents.\n\nNext, I ran a second program (with the same preamble as the program above) to list all the non-merge commits of each pull request. Based on the pants-on-head way I work, these will mostly be WIP. commits, but sometimes I did a better job and (possibly) linked directly to these.\n\nRunning go run . >> commits.txt dumped these commits onto the end of the file and completes the set of Git SHAs that need to be brought into the repository network for stable reference.\n\nBringing commits into the new repository network\n\nGiven the warning above (“does not belong to any branch on this repository”), it should be sufficient to ensure that my fork has a branch containing each relevant SHA I’d like to retain access to.\n\nBash here does a good enough job since all we’re doing is a bunch of git operations in sequence.\n\nRewriting references\n\nAt this point I should be safe and have some target to link to in my fork for each reference to a pull request or commit in the source repository. Now I just have to figure out how to automate that process (there are at least 275 code references over 15 files and I’m not doing that by hand).\n\nIronically, I used my own thing instead of Cody to figure out how to use xargs correctly for this task.",

Code Search was initially released in 2013 under the name Sourcegraph, but was rebranded to Code Search when the company unveiled Cody in 2023. Both products support all major programming languages.[2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSourcegraph Inc. was founded in by Stanford graduates Quinn Slack and Beyang Liu to drive the development of a code search and code intelligence tool, formerly called Sourcegraph. It was first released in 2013[3][4] but was rebranded to Code Search in 2023. It was partly inspired by Liu's experience using Google Code Search while he was a Google intern,[5] It was designed to \"tackle the big code problem\" by enabling developers to manage large codebases that span multiple repositories, programming languages, file formats, and projects.[6]\n\nCode Search was initially self-hosted by each customer on their own infrastructure.[7] Early customers included Uber, Dropbox, and Lyft.[7][8] In 2016, Code Search was criticized[9] for being provided with a Fair Source License with the developers explaining[10][11][5] that \"all of Sourcegraph’s [sic] source code is publicly available and hackable\"[12] and was intended to \"help open sourcers strike a balance between getting paid and preserving their values\".[13] In 2018, Code Search was licensed under the Apache License 2.0,[14][15] and Sourcegraph OSS has since been released under the Apache License 2.0. The commercial version, Code Search Enterprise, has been released under its own license.[16] In 2023, Code Search was criticized[17] for dropping the Apache license for most of its code, leaving it public but only available under its Enterprise license.[18]\n\nIn 2019, Code Search was integrated into the GitLab codebase, giving GitLab users access to a browser-based developer platform.[19] In 2021, a browser-based portal became available, allowing users to browse open-source projects and personal private code for free.[7] In 2022, Sourcegraph Cloud, a commercial single-tenant cloud solution for organizations with more than 100 developers, was launched.[20][7]\n\nSourcegraph has raised a total of almost $225 million in financing to date. Its most recent $125 million Series D investment in 2021 valued the company at $2.625 billion, a 300% growth from its previous valuation in 2020.[21]\n\nDate Funding Type Money Raised (USD) No. of Investors Lead Investor July 2021 Series D round 125,000,000[21] 4 Andreessen Horowitz December 2020 Series C round 50,000,000[22] 1 Sequoia Capital July 2020 Series B round 5,000,000[23] 1 Felicis Ventures March 2020 Series B round 23,000,000[24] 3 Craft Ventures October 2017 Series A round 20,000,000[25] 3 Goldcrest Capital, Redpoint\n\nIn 2023 Sourcegraph Inc. unveiled their new product Cody, and rebranded Sourcegraph to Code Search.\n\nProducts\n\n[edit]\n\nThe company has two major products: Cody and Code Search.\n\nSourcegraph Cody\n\n[edit]\n\nCody is a free and open-source AI coding assistant that can help users write, fix, and maintain your code.

Searches can be literal, regular expression, or structural. The structural search syntax is language-aware and handles nested expressions and multi-line statements better than regular expressions.[1] Sourcegraph's Code Search uses a variant of Google's PageRank algorithm to rank results by relevance.[28] Code Search can be used to search and analyze all of an organization's code.[4] During search indexing, the platform builds a global reference graph, that maps an entire codebase and enables functionality such as \"go to definition\".[29] Features include:\n\nSearch: Code can be searched and navigated through the Sourcegraph web interface or through browser and IDE extensions and text editor plugins.[1]\n\nNavigation: jumps to the definition of a variable or function, or find all references to it in a codebase.[1]\n\nBatch Changes: Enables developers and companies to automate and track large-scale code refactoring, security fixes, and migrations across repositories and code hosts.[30]\n\nCode Insights: Extracts data from a codebase to provide detailed analytics and visualizations to track the health and progress of a code project.[31]\n\nCode search has received adoption by such various sectors as\n\nResearch: Code search has been used to develop data mining methods for downstream dependencies[32] and to assist in refactoring and translating a program into its equivalent in another programming language.[33]\n\nPhysics: Code search is used in the CERN Accelerator Control software community to index, quickly search, and generate statistics on code.[34]\n\nCybersecurity: Code search has been used to gain better insight into source code during penetration testing.[35]\n\nAs of July 2021, Code search customers include Adidas, Lyft, Uber, Yelp,[27] Plaid, GE, Atlassian,[36] Amazon, PayPal, Qualtrics, and Cloudflare.[6]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]",

      "# [Sourcegraph Launches Cody Generative AI Tool to Write Code by Mike Vizard, Gabriel Martinez, Mitch Ashley, Natan Solomon, Saskia Sawyerr on 2023-12-14](https://devops.com/sourcegraph-launches-cody-generative-ai-tool-to-write-code/)\nSourcegraph today made generally available an open source Cody tool that leverages generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools to write and fix code.\n\nVersion 1.0 of Cody invokes StarCoder, an open source large language model (LLM) for creating code made available by Hugging Face and a chat tool that makes use of dense-sparse vector retrieval system for code and documentation to invoke GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 2, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude Instant and Mixtral-8x7B LLMs.\n\nDesigned to be deployed as an extension of VS Code, Cody is available in a free edition as well as a professional edition, dubbed Cody Pro, that Sourcegraph supports. Cody Pro will be free until February 2024, after which it will cost $9 per month. There is also a version for the JetBrains editor available in beta, along with an experimental Neovim offering.\n\nCody is also integrated with the code search tools provided by Sourcegraph to provide development teams with additional context that, depending on the use case, delivers a completion acceptance rate of 30% or higher for code.\n\nIn addition to enabling developers to write code faster, Coy also simultaneously invokes the graph technology Sourcegraph created to provide additional context to a prompt that makes it simpler to surface relevant code by parsing code and producing a graph that captures the semantic understanding of code. Cody, for example, can search the codebase for files and documents that can be used to suggest a rough plan of attack for implementing a new feature or resolving issues that surfaced in a bug report.\n\nCody can also create, save and share custom commands to make it simpler to reuse the prompts created to write code.\n\nFuture versions of Cody will be more tightly integrated with the Sourcegraph universal code graph to provide additional context. In addition, Cody will soon leverage deeper graph context to make autocomplete suggestions based on symbols defined elsewhere.\n\nSourcegraph CEO Quinn Slack said the combination of graph technologies and LLMs reduces latency while helping to ensure the code generated by the LLM doesn’t produce hallucinations such as type errors and imaginary function names.\n\nIn addition, Sourcegraph is committed to applying AI and graph technologies beyond the codebase itself to provide deeper insights into the environment code will eventually be deployed in, added Slack.\n\nIt’s not clear how much developers are relying on generative AI tools such as Cody and GitHub Copilot to write code faster, but it’s clear the pace at which software can be written is accelerating. That increased pace of application development will eventually require DevOps to revisit workflows that were not designed to manage codebases that, in the months ahead, will significantly increase in size.\n\nEach developer will most likely have a personal preference for one generative AI tool versus another, depending on the quality of the code generated. The issue is that no matter how good any of those tools are, however, the code generated will still need to be reviewed by a human before it can be deployed in any production environment."
