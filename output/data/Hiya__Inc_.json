      "# [Imposter Apps and How to Spot Them: Chronicles of App Store Imitators by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/imposter-apps/)\nImitation is the highest form of flattery. If that’s true, we at Hiya should be thrilled to see so many apps in the App Store claiming to be Hiya. Somehow it doesn’t quite ring true though.\n\nImposter apps are looking for one thing: money. As such, they “build” fake apps, load them onto the App Store, charge money for them and then sit back and reap the financial benefits until Apple shuts them down. Then, they rinse and repeat with another app.\n\nIn Hiya’s case, we now have scammers scamming an anti-scam company. Consider the gauntlet thrown.\n\nHow can you tell if an app in the app store is an imposter?\n\nDeveloper name: Hiya’s developer name is Hiya. Simple! It should be recognizable or a name that you can easily look up and verify. Note: the developer name will not always match the app name (for example, Hiya also owns the Mr. Number app), but, with a little research, you should be able to confirm if the developer is indeed legitimate.\n\nWebsite: In the app store, we link toHiya’s Web Site and ourHiya Caller ID and Block Support page. Imposter apps will have links as well, however, they don’t function or will lead to a page that has nothing to do with the app.\n\nCost: Did you hear from a friend that Hiya is free? They were right! If you go into the App store and all of a sudden, you have to pay for a “free” app, you’re looking at an imposter.\n\nReviews: One of the most important tools at our fingertips. As fake apps are just that – fake, they will not function as they are supposed to. After paying $1.99 for an app and it doesn’t work, you can bet reviews will come in and they will not be pleasant. Take a look at the reviews. Sure, Hiya doesn’t get 5 star reviews all the time (nobody’s perfect…not yet, at least), but, we have a wide range of positive reviews from many users. Imposters will have only a few reviews and they will not be positive.\n\nImposters will receive a few, very bad reviews",
      "# [Amazon Scam Calls to Watch For | Hiya by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/amazon-scam)\nAmazon is in an enviable position of being a top retailer and having global brand recognition. The flip side of that, however, is that its notoriety makes it a prime target for scammers. Fraudsters making random robocalls have a good chance of reaching someone who has an Amazon account.\n\nAmazon has operations on five continents and has dedicated websites in 13 countries. It’s no wonder that Amazon phone scams are common in many countries, including\n\n#1 phone scam in Canada\n\n#1 phone scam in the UK\n\n#2 phone scam in the US\n\nHow do Amazon scam calls work?\n\nNo matter how hard you try to keep your phone number private, scammers have several tactics to obtain contact information. There are data brokers that find personal information online and sell it to third parties. Scammers can purchase this information and then contact you about your Amazon account. Scammers can also obtain any personal information that was leaked during a data breach.\n\nOnce they have your phone number, scammers make a call from an unknown number or one that was spoofed to appear as if it were coming from Amazon. The scammer then claims to be part of the Amazon customer support team calling about an issue with an order or a notice of a security breach. The scammer then attempts to gain your personal information (like your Amazon account username and password or credit card information) by claiming that this information is necessary to resolve the issue.\n\nSamples of Amazon scam calls\n\nBelow are transcripts of actual Amazon scam calls. These are from the Hiya honeypot: a collection of Hiya-owned phone numbers used to capture the content of scam and nuisance calls. Here is the wording of the three most common Amazon scam calls observed by Hiya:\n\n“Hello. This is Amazon. This call is to authorize a payment of $999. We would like to inform you that there is an order placed for an Apple iPhone 11 Pro using your Amazon account. If you do not authorize this order press 1, or press 2 to authorize this order.\n\n“This is a confirmation call from Amazon regarding your purchase of iPhone 13 Pro Max and Apple Airpods, totaling $1499. But we have found some suspicious activities in your account while processing the payment. So in order to cancel your order, kindly press 1 to speak with the Amazon fraud department.”\n\n“Hello. Amazon Express notice. A courier delivered twice and no one has signed for it. For details, please press 1.”\n\nEach call has a common element: the robocall asks the recipient to press a number, which will connect with a phony Amazon representative. Instead of wasting time making live calls, the scammers start with a robocall, and if the recipient falls for the scam and presses a number, a live operator will attempt to get the victim to reveal their Amazon account information or credit card number.\n\nReports from Hiya users\n\nIn addition to the honeypot, Hiya also receives user reports from consumers using Hiya Protect via their carrier, device manufacturer, or the Hiya mobile app. Here’s a sampling of the Amazon scam calls users are reporting:\n\n“Multiple calls from multiple numbers to convince me to let them help with a fraudulent purchase on Amazon.”\n\n“Claims to be from Amazon. Usually, a message that wants you to call them back about an order, then they try to pump you for information.”\n\n“Claiming to be Amazon to renew a monthly fee of $99 per month. If you speak to a consultant to cancel, they request your bank details to stop the payment.”\n\nHow to protect against scam calls\n\nCarriers can add Hiya Protect, a complete call protection solution that enables carriers to protect their subscribers by blocking and labeling spam calls, and helping them identify wanted calls. Hiya Protect recently added a new layer of protection, Personal AI, which personalizes call protection to individual subscribers so they receive the calls that are important to them and are protected from targeted attacks.\n\nWith Hiya Connect, enterprises can improve customer engagement and loyalty while protecting their customers from deceitful interactions and their brand reputation from inaccurate spam labeling. Get a free Reputation Analysis report to see if your customers are at risk.\n\nIndividuals can check with their phone carrier to see if it offers any spam/scam-blocking capabilities. If not, ask your carrier to consider adding Hiya Protect.",
      "# [What is enterprise branded call? Display a branded caller ID | Hiya by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/branded-call)\nWe’ve all had the experience of seeing an unknown number pop up on our phones. Without thinking, we answer the call, only to hear, “[car warranty scam beginning.]” The frustration we feel from this spam call, coupled with the frequency we experience it, leaves us with a sour taste in our mouths. It’s no wonder 87% of consumers believe unidentified calls may be fraudulent. And for call centers that regularly make outbound calls, this has detrimental effects.\n\nThat’s why branding your calls with your business name is so important. With a Branded Call, the caller ID displays a caller’s company name, location, logo, and other identifiable information before the call even starts. Instead of seeing “unknown caller” and worrying about the nuisance of a potential spam call, a Branded Call allows customers to identify and trust the source of a call immediately.\n\nLet your customers know you're calling. With branded caller ID, display your company name, logo, and location to engage with more people, faster.\n\nBenefits of enterprise branded caller ID\n\nAlthough agencies like the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are trying to use their resources to stop the exponential increase in spam calls, they’re simply aren't given enough to respond to the rapidly evolving scam tactics deployed by scammers.\n\nTrust\n\nWhen consumers cannot trust the calls coming from your business, it starts affecting their perception of your brand. Imagine you are waiting for a call from your food delivery service on the status of your order. Time goes by and you haven’t received an update. You’d be pretty frustrated and your confidence in the company would plummet. While the delivery driver could have been calling you all along, you didn’t answer the calls because you didn’t know who was calling. As more and more customers stop answering their phones for unidentified calls, this damaged reputation can snowball into massive losses as customers choose other delivery services.\n\nSecurity and spam\n\nFraudsters are always ready and willing to impersonate well-known companies—and with people more connected to their phones than ever before, telecom scams are their method of choice. But with Hiya’s Branded Call, by providing your company name and logo, you can assure your customers that your call is legitimate. Hiya also offers Secure Call, an additional feature that pre-authenticates outbound calls before they are made, securing your branded caller identity, and protecting your customers from falling victim to fraudsters using your numbers.\n\nBranding\n\nThe customer's experience of the call will influence whether they have a positive or negative perception of your business. A Branded Call will help create a visual experience that draws the customer in and increases their positive association with the business and its call center. Word of mouth is a powerful marketing vehicle, so it is important to remember that positive interactions often lead customers to spread the word.\n\nIncrease answer rates\n\nImagine you get two calls—one says “unknown number” and the other says a company’s name. Which one are you going to answer? Call centers with a branded caller ID through Hiya report an average 80% increase in answer rates. Customers pick up the phone when they know who’s calling.\n\nWhat are the risks of not having an enterprise branded caller ID?\n\nAt this point, you should be quite familiar with the fact that branded caller ID can improve the efforts of your contact center dramatically. But what are the risks associated with not having a Branded Call? Consider the following:\n\nUnanswered calls\n\nWhat do most people do when they encounter an unknown number? They ignore the call. According to Hiya's State of the Call survey, 84% of consumers think an unidentified call is fraudulent. As a result of being unable to communicate essential information to your customers, your company’s bottom line will suffer.\n\nThe challenges of unidentified calls\n\nIn today's digital age, trust is paramount. When a call comes in without a clear indicator of who is calling, many consumers hesitate to answer, fearing potential scams or unwanted solicitations. Imagine eagerly awaiting an update on your food delivery order. Minutes turn into hours, and there's no word. Your frustration mounts, and your trust in the service wanes. Unbeknownst to you, the delivery driver may have been trying to reach you, but their calls went unanswered because there was no clear indication of who was on the other end. This scenario is becoming increasingly common as more individuals opt to ignore unidentified calls. As this trend continues, businesses face the risk of eroding customer trust and loyalty, potentially leading to significant losses as customers turn to competitors with clearer communication channels.\n\nHow Hiya can help\n\nWant to know how you can brand your business name on your outbound calls? calling an iPhone or Android? Getting Hiya Connect can help you change your caller ID to accurately identify and increase your answer rates. The Branded Call feature helps call centers display their company name, logo, and reason for calling. This will help your business contact the right individuals while building trust in your brand. Hiya’s Voice Performance Platform also gives you the ability to:\n\nTrack the impact of Branded Call over time\n\nMonitor your caller reputation health\n\nUnderstand why calls have been blocked or reported\n\nSecure calls and prevent number hijacking",

      "# [What Are Sales Optimization Best Practices? by Alicia Marie Beatty](https://blog.hiya.com/sales-optimizations)\nOptimizing your call performance strategy can be a difficult, arduous task--made even worse if your team is constantly hiring and training new agents. Many managers find it difficult to focus their team’s efforts on activities that will maximize revenue. We’ve been there, and we’re here to help.\n\nThe word “optimization” is used so frequently in business conversations that the meaning often becomes masked by other definitions. Managers will frequently, mistakenly use “optimize” in lieu of other, more appropriate words like “growth” or “high performance.” And though these definitions may appear to be quite similar, using the words interchangeably will cause your sales team to miss out on golden opportunities.\n\nIn this article, we’re taking a minute to break down what sales optimization really is, why it’s critical for your success, and how you can begin implementing best practices today.\n\nWhat Is Sales Optimization?\n\nSales optimization is the process of analyzing and improving sales performance to achieve maximum revenue. Good managers evaluate the performance of sales teams and provide training to help agents develop skills that lead to wins.\n\nOptimizations are important in every industry, but it especially applies to the work done in contact centers. Because outbound calls are so repetitive, it can be easy for agents to develop bad habits through lack of focus. Optimization occurs when agents consistently use best practices to increase the likelihood of closing sales.\n\nOptimization Best Practices\n\nThere are many things that contact centers can do to maximize their sales revenue. Here are three ways to take your optimization strategy to the next level:\n\n1. Set Long Term Goals\n\nSince sales optimization is all about choosing the most efficient path to success, it’s important to start by visualizing your end goal. Set goals based on yearly revenue and sales, and keep those goals top of mind.\n\nA common misstep: call center teams tend to focus more on short-term goals than they do on long-term goals. Weekly, monthly, and quarterly goals are only useful if they provide a clear path to achieving long-term business goals. Because sales optimization is all about adjusting performance over time, you’ll need to be careful to not get so focused on hitting this quarter’s numbers that you forget about the bigger picture.\n\nSome managers find it difficult to create lasting, measurable goals, instead opting for short-term goals that are easy to achieve. This is understandable, since long-term goals are usually more high-level and difficult to track. Although they are typically more difficult to track, long-term goals can be, and usually are, more closely aligned with the call center’s mission statement than short-term goals. However, it is impossible to optimize for long-term goals without having a way to measure performance metrics. In short, make sure your goals are tied to a measurable KPI that can be tracked. An example of this might be, ”increase sales by 13% by the end of Q3.” This example hits the sweet spot between setting a goal for your team without being prescriptive or restrictive about the ways in which they go about achieving that goal—creating focus, and allowing for innovation to discover new methods of optimization along the way.\n\n2. Use A Voice Performance Platform for Sales Optimization\n\nSales optimization platforms (like Hiya’s Voice Performance Platform) provide all the tools you need to successfully implement software sales strategies. With these tools for data collection and analysis (and, on a premiere software like Hiya, customized insights) you can stay on track for reaching your long-term goals. Good platforms will also include solutions to common problems call centers face, such as security, reputation management, audience analysis data, and more.\n\nWhen deciding on a voice performance platform, pay attention to what’s offered; is the software cloud-based? Does it contain fraud filters? And is the data self-service, on demand, and accessible 24/7? Sales optimization platforms that include these features can be far more valuable than standard, static caller registries, as they go beyond the basic information provided by your dialer. Choose a platform that will best meet your company’s needs and help you achieve your long-term goals.\n\n3. Make Data-Driven Decisions\n\nThe best sales processes always include an emphasis on tracking and analyzing data which allows managers to make decisions based on actionable insights. While everything up to this point has been important, this step is where the most tangible, significant results happen.\n\nMaking business decisions that are rooted in data does two things to your sales performance. First, it gives you an imperial metric to guide you in an industry that is all too frequently subjective. You can’t fool numbers. Second, it gives you a way to measure the efficacy of your initiatives. Many sales optimization platforms, such as Hiya’s Voice Performance Platform, will allow you to identify lead quality -- an invaluable resource for your agents. While it’s not an exact science, if your decisions aren’t backed by data and tracked in an organized manner, you’ll have no idea if an initiative is making an impact.\n\nAs you track your team’s performance, pay attention to trends in data. For example, if you notice a sudden drop in answer rates, it may be a sign that an imposter is spoofing your calls. No amount of training your agents will improve that metric. Once you’ve discovered a spoofing problem, you can take action by securing your calls and giving customers the confidence to answer. Fortunately, many sales optimization platforms, including Hiya Connect, can help notify you when problems like this arise and can solve them before they have a chance to negatively impact performance.\n\nUsing Hiya Connect for Sales Optimization\n\nHiya Connect, a Voice Performance Platform, is the industry-leading platform for performance analytics. Its intuitive dashboard integrates all of your metrics in one platform, allowing for a clear, comprehensive view of your performance. Hiya also provides data-driven insights to give you actionable steps to improve call performance. These are a few examples of how Hiya Connect can help you reach your optimization goals.\n\nCall centers may come across a sudden decline in answer rates, which may signify an imposter attempting to spoof your calls. Customers become conditioned to not pick up the phone anymore after they’ve received spam calls from numbers that look similar to your business numbers. Hiya Connect protects against spam labels and secures network connections, so you will never have to face this issue again.\n\nWhat if your answer rates were never high to begin with? Hiya Connect provides call centers with branded calls, which display your company name, logo, and a custom, informative reason for calling. Answer rates increase significantly when the prospect knows the identity of the caller.",
      "# [Evolution of Phones and its Affect on Society by Hiya Team](https://blog.hiya.com/telephone-transformation/)\nThe smartphones we possess today have come a long way from the first rendition of the telephone back in 1876 when Alexander Graham Bell invented and patented the first short-range phone. But like people, phones have evolved throughout history to cater to our lifestyles and needs.\n\nHere’s a look at how telephones have transformed over the years…\n\nShort-Range Phone: Despite a number of individuals from around the world who’ve contributed to the invention of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell was the first to receive a patent for his short-range phone in 1876. Testing out the phone in his Boston laboratory, he rang his assistant Thomas Watson, and become well known-for saying, “Mr. Watson, come here – I want to see you.”\n\nCandlestick Phone: The candlestick phone became popular in the 1890s through the 1930s. Separated by two pieces, it featured a mouth piece (transmitter) mounted at the top of the stand, and a receiver (ear phone) that the user would hold to their ear during a call.\n\nRotary Phone: Pushing out the candlestick phone, the rotary phone came about in the 1930s when manufacturers began to combine the mouth piece and receiver of the candlestick phones into a single unit. When dialing a rotary phone, what originally started as lugs, but evolved into holes, one would then rotate the dial to the number that they wanted and then would release the dial.\n\nTouch-Dial Phone: On November 18, 1963, the Bell System unveiled the first electronic touch-dial phone system with touch-tone dialing. It would become the worldwide standard for telecommunication signaling. Using audible tones for each of the digits on the push-button keypad, specific frequencies were designated to each row and column. The tones helped the switching center determine which key was pressed.\n\nFirst Mobile Phone: On April 3, 1973, Motorola researcher and executive, Martin Cooper, made the first mobile telephone from handheld subscriber equipment. Weighing in at 2.4 lbs and measuring at 228.6 x 127 x 44.4mm, Cooper was said to have called a rival telecommunications company and let them know he was talking to them on a mobile phone. The prototype was able to give a caller 30 minutes of talk-time and took about 10 hours to charge.\n\nCordless Phone: Cordless phones became a hot commodity in the 1980s but was originally invented by a female Jazz musician named Teri Pall in 1965. The handset cord of the telephone was replaced with a radio link. However, Teri’s invention would not hit the consumer market until a decade and a half later.\n\nFirst Portable Phone: Even though Martin Cooper invented the first mobile phone, the first portable mobile phone was the MicroTAC which was introduced in 1989 as “an innovative new “flip” design”, where the “mouthpiece” folded over the keypad, although the “mouthpiece” was actually located in the base of the phone, along with the ringer. Up until its release, most cellular phones were installed as car phones due to the inability to fit them into a jacket pocket.\n\nNokia: Through the mid-90s and into the early 2000s, Nokia mobile phones catered to consumers, with interchangeable faceplates, customizable designs, the first WAP browser, internal antenna, T9 Text messaging, and eventually an LCD screen and internet connectivity.\n\nFirst Camera Phone (Sanyo SCP-5300): Possessing the first camera phone, the U.S. finally adopted the Japanese trend in November 2002. The clunky clamshell design could capture photos at 640×480 pixels and had a basic flash, white balance control, self-timer, digital zoom, and various filters (sepia, black and white, and negative colors.)\n\nCrack-Berry (BlackBerry): Blackberry made waves with their popular RIM communication device in 2003 which possessed a phone, PDA, and e-mail system all in one hand-held phone. The term crack-berry came about when users constantly checked their e-mail and sent short messages through their device.\n\nSleek Mobile Design (Motorola Razr): First developed in 2003, the Motorola Razr hit it big when it was marketed as a fashion phone due to its sleek and thin profile. Over its four-year run, they sold over a 130 million phones and were named the best-selling clamshell phone in history.\n\nSmartphones: Dating back as far as 1997, it wasn’t until Japan became the first mobile market to popularize the smartphone in 1999. As BlackBerry, Palm, HTC, Windows Mobile, Samsung, Nokia, and Motorola made a name for themselves in the early 2000s, their smartphones had the capability to email, fax, and search the internet. As the smartphone craze escalated, cell phone manufacturers tested a number of functionalities that would help them capitalize on the new trend. From sliding, flipping, rotating, vertical, and even multiple keyboards, touchscreen smartphones made their way into the market which also introduce the stylus. However, the functionality these phones offered were still targeting more business users versus consumers.\n\nCue in iPhone 3G. The first of its kind, the original iPhone was the first touch-screen smartphone that was unveiled in June 2007. Apple’s take on the smartphone combines “multimedia functions with the same email and Web browsing features as all other smartphones previously had. It had a large color display with a capacitive digitizer, and its user interface was finally finger-friendly. And unlike phones before it, the iPhone had only one button on its face – the Home button – and three around its edges, two for volume up/down and one for power/standby.” reports the “The Evolution of the Smartphone” from PocketNow.\n\nToday, iPhone has paved the way for a number of other cell phone manufacturers to create their own version of the smartphones we love today. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg on how phones have evolved over history, but it’s apparent that as phones change, engineers will cater to the needs of consumers. What do you think the evolution of phones will come up with next?\n\nKeep on top of all the trends in Voice with Hiya's State of the Call report below.",

      "# [iPhone FAQ](https://www.hiya.com/faq-ios)\nÂ\n\nGetting Started\n\nWhere can I learn more about using Hiya?\n\nYou can learn more at our Help Center here.\n\nHiya is not working correctly.Â What is one thing I can try before I try anything else? (The Fail Safe)\n\nThe fail-safe: Consider the fail-safe the app version of calling IT Support and them asking if you restarted your computer.\n\nHowever, itâs important to note that when you uninstall the app, you will lose the numbers in your blocklist. With that said, use this as a last resort if you have an extensive blocklist. (âSave Blocklistâ functionality is a popular request and we are looking into it for future updates).\n\nDisable Hiya in Settings\n\nForce-quit Settings\n\nUninstall Hiya\n\nRestart your device\n\nReinstall Hiya\n\nThe enable Hiya option in the iPhone settings is not working. What do I do?\n\nFirst, our latest update on iOS has experienced issues with enabling and/or updating. We have been in communication with Apple and this is a known bug. Apple offered a workaround that seems to work (and it doesnât require an uninstall of Hiya which causes you to lose your blocklist). So, if you are experiencing issues after updating to the latest version, please try this:\n\nWait at least one hour after Hiya gets into a bad state. Reboot the phone, then try to enable Hiya again and it should correct itself.\n\nIf this doesn't work then try the fail-safe just above.Â\n\nMy Caller ID name is wrong. How do I change it?\n\nIf you notice your number is incorrectly labeled as spam, or you notice that wrong information is shown or missing from your own number or someone elseâs or, if you would like to remove your information from our services altogether, please click here and we can help you.\n\nHow do I report inaccurate or offensive comments?\n\nIf your number has inaccurate or offensive comments please follow the steps on this linked form and we can look into getting them removed for you.\n\nI have been waiting for the activation code but have yet to receive it. What gives?\n\nWe use Facebook Account Kit for our SMS code verification. Unfortunately, we have no control over whether it works or not.Â With that said, we want it to work as much as you do. Here are a few tips that may help:\n\nTry the fail-safe (noted at the top of the article).\n\nMake sure you have âUnited States (+1)â selected (assuming your phone is, indeed, a U.S. number)\n\nOnly use numbers, donât start with 1 or +1\n\nEnsure your device is subscribed to a texting plan and can receive short-code messages. This one sounds obvious, but weâve had a few instances where users (and even one of our own developers!) had short-code text messages auto-disabled through their carrier. If you arenât receiving activation codes, it is worth a call to your carrier to ensure youâre supported.\n\nCall Blocking\n\nHow can I block Spoofed Calls / Neighbor Scam (calls that show as my area code and prefix) on Hiya?Â\n\nThere is a way to block spoofed calls in the iPhone app.Â In the Hiya app, tap on options in the bottom right, then scroll down to the Spoofed Calls / Neighbor Scam option and choose block.Â You can also choose to alert instead of block.Â\n\nPlease be aware that the block option will block all calls with your area code and your prefix.Â Even those in your contact list.Â This is something that we will fix in the next release in the next couple of weeks.Â In the meantime, the alert option is probably your best bet.Â\n\nWhy is the iPhone app blocking a contact from calling me?\n\nDo you have a contact in your iPhone that is blocked from calling you and you're not sure why?Â You might have to change a setting to fix it.Â Â\n\nIn the Hiya app, tap on Options in the bottom right, then scroll down to the Spoofed Calls / Neighbor Scam option and choose Alert or Do Nothing. Â The block option for spoofed calls will block all calls with your area code and your prefix.Â Even those in your contact list.Â This is something that we will fix in our next iPhone release.Â In the meantime, the alert option is probably the best bet.\n\nIs there a way to prevent blocked calls from going to voicemail?\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot prevent blocked calls from going to voicemail. This is a limitation from Apple that prevents us from hanging up on blocked calls. As soon as Apple lifts this limitation, we will eagerly make it available. We want to hang up on them as well.\n\nIs there a way to see calls that have been blocked?\n\nUnfortunately, not. This is another implementation detail from Apple that we canât work around (we can provide a blocked calls list with Android). We have no idea why we canât have a âHey! Weâre awesome and hereâs a list of calls weâve blocked for youâ section somewhere. The day that changes is the day youâll see it.\n\nIs there any way to block all unknown caller ID/private callers?\n\nUnfortunately, thereâs no way to block all unknown callers, in the app or iPhone itself. We can only block an actual number that is recognized by caller ID. Android has some cool features like block by area code, but at this time, we canât provide that feature on iPhone.\n\nIn iOS is there a way to import or export the block list after un/reinstalling?Â\n\nWe donât have a âsave block listâ function right nowâ¦ However, it is a popular request so we are looking into it.\n\nProtection\n\nHow do I use Hiya to look up unknown numbers?\n\nFirst copy the unknown number from your Recents within the Phone application and then open Hiya. Hiya will ask you if you want to identify the number you just copied. Tap âyesâ and Hiya will look up the number for you.\n\nWhat are the steps for copying phone numbers?\n\nTo copy a phone number, go to your Recent calls within the iPhone Phone application and tap on the info icon (the âiâ with a circle around it) for the number you wish to look up. Once youâre on the contact card, press the caller's number and hold it for a couple seconds. The option to copy the number will appear. Tap âCopyâ and the number is ready for you to paste into other apps.\n\nHow do I look up numbers with the widget (iOS 8 and above only)?\n\nFirst install the Hiya widget. To install the widget, pull down the Notification Center. Make sure you are on the âTodayâ tab. Scroll to the bottom and tap âEdit.â You will be shown a list of apps that have widgets available. Tap on Hiya to add the widget.\n\nNext, copy the number you want to look up from your Recent Call Log. Pull down the Notification Center and scroll to the Hiya widget. The phone number will be automatically identified there.\n\nHow does Hiya identify incoming scam and spam calls?\n\nHiya adds an address book entry containing hundreds of phone numbers for known-to-be spammers and scammers. Because scammers and spammers are constantly changing their phone numbers to avoid detection, we update our entries at least once a day, often more.\n\nWhy does an inbound call not get marked as spam, even if Hiya reports show it as a spam number?\n\nThere are a few things here.\n\n#1) Our database of spammers is gigantic. Unfortunately, we are not able to enter every single spam number in the world into CallKit. We have to be picky and so we choose only the spam numbers that we have the highest confidence in to ID on the incoming call. For the remaining numbers, sometimes youâll have to manually look them up in the app to see if they are Suspected Spam or not.Â\n\n#2) When a call comes in, we look up the number to see if itâs spam. Usually, it takes less than one second, but sometimes it simply takes longer and calls can get through.\n\nI have installed the app, but so far no calls have been identifiedâ¦.?\n\nIf calls are not being identified at all when you get them, then something has probably gone wrong. A simple check is to see if any calls are identified in the native phone call log. You should see some Hiya entries in there if itâs working.\n\nIf not, revert to the fail-safe (see above) and then, go back into the app, in the Call Protection tab, click on âUpdate Nowâ and give it about a minute to update, then check the call log again.\n\nAre spam numbers updated in the background or do I have to manually launch the app occasionally to update?\n\nIf you enable Hiya (through the phone's Settings> Phone> Call Blocking and Identification), then our spam lists will update in the background. Leading to our next ever-popular questionâ¦\n\nI enabled Hiya in the phone's settings, why does the app continually tell me I need to go in and update (by showing a red dot on the app icon)?\n\nAnytime the spam list updates, you will receive a badge notification on the Hiya icon. This is to let you know that itâs working and updating. If you prefer not to see this, you can disable badge icons in your Settings (the spam lists will still continue to update, you just wonât be notified as such).\n\nTo disable badge icons follow these steps:Â Go into your settings for the iPhone itself.Â Go to Settings> Notifications> Hiya>Â and then disable âBadge App Icon.âÂ\n\nWhy do the number of scam and spam calls I am protected from keep changing?\n\nScammers and spammers are constantly changing their phone numbers to avoid being blocked by our app. We update the lists of scammers and spammers at least once a day, as long as the app is active to ensure that you stay protected from unwanted calls.Â Typically a scammer's number will only be active for 2-5 days before it is shut down by it's own provider.Â When a number is shutdown and deactivated we take it off of the total blocked list.Â Â\n\nWhat is the difference between scam calls, spam calls and blacklisted calls?\n\nScams are calls trying to get you to send them money or are found to be fraud in some other way. Spam calls are calls from telemarketers, bill collectors, solicitors, etc. Spam is not dangerous, but can be very annoying. Blacklisted calls are from numbers that you choose to blacklist because you want them blocked. This is someone such as an ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend or anyone you just donât want to talk to.\n\nHow do I use the spam check dialer?\n\nGo to the âCallâ tab in the app and type in the phone number you want to dial. If no spam is detected, then the call will go through. If the number you are dialing is identified as spam, you will be warned and asked if you want to continue with the call.\n\nDoes the âreal-timeâ notification only work over wifi or 3g?\n\nHiya doesnât require any network connection; if you can receive a phone call, it works!Â You will only need a connection to update the Spam numbers list.Â\n\nPrivacy\n\nWhy do you need access to my contacts?\n\nUpon signing up for Hiya, you agree to share your contacts, but we keep all contact data private and donât sell it to third parties or use it to market to your contacts. Because weâre not awful human beings. More information can be found here.\n\nIs giving you access to my contact list still necessary?\n\nFor full functionality, yes. We use it for the smart dialer, to autocomplete suggestions, to whitelist spam functionality, for sharing functionality and for adding to block list functionality. With that said, you donât have to grant contacts permission, but the app will have some limited operation.\n\nDo you have access to my call logs on the iPhone?\n\nWe do not have access to call logs on the iPhone.\n\nHow do you keep contact information private if you use Facebook?\n\nFacebook is used only for login, itâs optional, and nothing is shared with Facebook. Facebook AccountKit is used for phone verification. It does not require a Facebook account, it only verifies the phone number.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nHiya is still not working correctly.Â What is one thing I can try after I try have tried everything else? (The Fail Safe)\n\nThe fail-safe: Consider the fail-safe the app version of calling IT Support and them asking if you restarted your computer.\n\nHowever, itâs important to note that when you uninstall the app, you will lose the numbers in your blocklist. With that said, use this as a last resort if you have an extensive blocklist. (âSave Blocklistâ functionality is a popular request and we are looking into it for future updates).\n\nDisable Hiya in Settings\n\nForce-quit Settings\n\nUninstall Hiya\n\nRestart your device\n\nReinstall Hiya\n\nI have been waiting for the activation code but have yet to receive it.

This will remove the \"Suspected Spam\", \"Scam or Fraud\", and \"Blacklisted\" contacts that the app uses for Spam/Scam identification.\n\nExit the app and long-press the app icon.\n\nAn \"x\" will appear in one corner. Tap the \"x\" to completely uninstall.\n\nI've uninstalled Hiya but why do calls still seem to be getting blocked?\n\nIf you are still having issues after uninstalling Hiya you might have to reinstall the app and then try these steps:Â Â\n\nDisable Hiya in the iPhone Settings (Settings->Phone->Call Blocking & Identification)\n\nForce-quit Settings\n\nUninstall Hiya\n\nRestart your device\n\nThe Hiya widget doesnât appear as a choice on Notifications.\n\nIf youâve already tried the fail-safe (see above), letâs give this a whirl instead: Pull down the notification center by swiping down from the top of the screen. Swipe right to bring up the widgets page, scroll to the bottom. Tap the circular âeditâ button, and tap the â+â button next to Hiya.\n\nHelp\n\nHow can I give feedback?\n\nWe'd love to hear from you.

For most to work properly now, the calls have to go to their service first, compared against a database and stir/shaken protocol and then sent to your phone. For those complaining about their voicemail being broken, it’s because your phone is forwarding out to this service. Search disable call forwarding codes for your mobile carrier to get your VM back. Spam really needs to be blocked at the switch level with your carrier and is the whole point of stir/shaken.  Check to see if your carrier has a spam tool for your phone and use that.

Also Serves as a makeshift caller ID where there wasn’t one available beforehand on legitimate business numbers from in and out of State. Works best as long as you KEEP APP OPEN and REFRESH THE DATABASE. Also, submit info on the spam numbers you as a user encounter, which I assume is how the “database” stays current. We are the keepers and informed participants of the content. We are the victims and must report the wrongdoings. Else the numbers won’t be known to this system. Cons- This app has a hard time catching spam calls with local area code prefix. After listening to a recent episode of the “Reply All” podcast on the subject: Why spam calls on cellphones appear as local numbers even if the local area where you travel changes? It is because these numbers are very appealing to intended victims and therefore appealing for spam software. You, The intended recipient is much more likely to answer a local call than one out of state, just the act of answering means the spam bot now knows your number is an active phone, you will see an increase in calls from local spam numbers. Happy Birthday Frankenstein! The thing you should do? Don’t decline them, don’t answer them. But do Report them through this Hiya app for now and hope that spam call scientists find a way to neutralize this curse to our existence before we end up eating ourselves out of the trap to break free into a new more nub-centric experience.",

On iOS, it’s absolutely worthless.\n\nI previously used a competing product that was terrific, but for some reason my current carrier isn’t compatible with too many of these solutions, so I had to purchase a subscription to Hiya instead.\n\nDespite having all settings exactly as required, and even after deactivating and reactivating, the app literally does nothing. It will allow every phone call through, known or unknown, unless you manually enter into the block list, so every unwanted call is going to ring your phone at least the first time.\n\nSecondly, don’t expect the call lookup to give you any information, which is comical because it’s the main point of the app. It almost always comes up as “Unknown Caller” and serves up no information. I almost always have to resort to doing a Google search to investigate the number myself.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, it doesn’t block unknown calls (and yes, I have the phone’s “Silence Unknown Calls” setting on, and all toggles on for Hiya to screen and block calls. It’s not user error), and 99% of the time it can’t identify the caller when using the lookup feature. So tell me, what exactly did I purchase an annual subscription for?\n\nAs I write this, the last update by the developers was four months ago.

You had to enter area codes you use that may be spoofed. The app would update with numbers found to be questionable when the app wasn’t force closed. I don’t know if the app scanned for these, or if they were shared by other users. It reminds me a little of Waze though. For years, I recommended that people try it. No more. \n\nNow it does nothing except allow me to report questionable calls, and I just reported my last number to them. $25/year is just too high for this kind of automatic service. But then, there’s a lot of people who think they’re worth more than they are too.",

I’ve asked support three times and each time I only get a canned response saying they unblocked the single number I was referencing. Here’s the problem. The number is for Uber. Uber uses a number exchange so when drivers and riders communicate their personal numbers aren’t shared. When Hiya blocks one of these numbers, drivers and customers can’t communicate. So the one number they unblocked is fine but there are many many more numbers they use for the exchange so having to contact support with each number they block is very inefficient and I have better things to do. And also, it’s too late, the call was already blocked. In the third email with Hiya support I said that if there isn’t a way for me to whitelist numbers I would have to request a refund.

      "# Fails to deliver on its promise, 1 stars [(Iarneson, Apple App Store, 2024-08-09)](https://apple/11591519275)\nI downloaded this app with high hopes that it would finally put an end to the constant stream of spam and scam calls I receive daily. Unfortunately, it has been a huge disappointment. Despite its claims, the app barely blocks any unwanted calls. In fact, I’ve noticed no significant reduction in the number of spam calls I’m receiving. The app’s interface is clunky and not user-friendly. It’s difficult to navigate and offers very few customization options to better tailor the blocking features to my needs. Worse yet, legitimate calls are occasionally blocked while spam calls still get through. This defeats the entire purpose of the app! I’ve tried adjusting the settings multiple times, but nothing seems to improve its performance. It’s incredibly frustrating to be expected to pay for a service that doesn’t work as advertised. Save your money and look elsewhere if you’re serious about blocking spam and scam calls.",

Also Serves as a makeshift caller ID where there wasn’t one available beforehand on legitimate business numbers from in and out of State. Works best as long as you KEEP APP OPEN and REFRESH THE DATABASE. Also, submit info on the spam numbers you as a user encounter, which I assume is how the “database” stays current. We are the keepers and informed participants of the content. We are the victims and must report the wrongdoings. Else the numbers won’t be known to this system. Cons- This app has a hard time catching spam calls with local area code prefix. After listening to a recent episode of the “Reply All” podcast on the subject: Why spam calls on cellphones appear as local numbers even if the local area where you travel changes? It is because these numbers are very appealing to intended victims and therefore appealing for spam software. You, The intended recipient is much more likely to answer a local call than one out of state, just the act of answering means the spam bot now knows your number is an active phone, you will see an increase in calls from local spam numbers. Happy Birthday Frankenstein! The thing you should do? Don’t decline them, don’t answer them.

On iOS, it’s absolutely worthless.\n\nI previously used a competing product that was terrific, but for some reason my current carrier isn’t compatible with too many of these solutions, so I had to purchase a subscription to Hiya instead.\n\nDespite having all settings exactly as required, and even after deactivating and reactivating, the app literally does nothing. It will allow every phone call through, known or unknown, unless you manually enter into the block list, so every unwanted call is going to ring your phone at least the first time.\n\nSecondly, don’t expect the call lookup to give you any information, which is comical because it’s the main point of the app. It almost always comes up as “Unknown Caller” and serves up no information. I almost always have to resort to doing a Google search to investigate the number myself.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, it doesn’t block unknown calls (and yes, I have the phone’s “Silence Unknown Calls” setting on, and all toggles on for Hiya to screen and block calls. It’s not user error), and 99% of the time it can’t identify the caller when using the lookup feature. So tell me, what exactly did I purchase an annual subscription for?\n\nAs I write this, the last update by the developers was four months ago.

Heck, I would like to block whole area codes. \nUpdate (2023): Still drops off in iOS 17 I can’t keep this in working order. The beta for iOS 14 is over and they still can’t get it together so the app appears in “phone” settings to choose as the call blocker. It also doesn’t show anything it actually blocked. Still getting telemarketing calls.",

I’ve asked support three times and each time I only get a canned response saying they unblocked the single number I was referencing. Here’s the problem. The number is for Uber. Uber uses a number exchange so when drivers and riders communicate their personal numbers aren’t shared. When Hiya blocks one of these numbers, drivers and customers can’t communicate. So the one number they unblocked is fine but there are many many more numbers they use for the exchange so having to contact support with each number they block is very inefficient and I have better things to do. And also, it’s too late, the call was already blocked. In the third email with Hiya support I said that if there isn’t a way for me to whitelist numbers I would have to request a refund. They didn’t care, just send me instructions on how to get a refund.",

      "# Simply does not screen my calls, 1 stars [(RussianMorty, Apple App Store, 2023-10-19)](https://apple/10492365207)\nI got this app because I am getting maybe 20-30 calls a day from telemarketers. The app advertised that it would help block these calls, but after installing I still get the calls. If I use hiya to search a number, I can then block it and report it, but at that point, I can just block the number on my phone. The app is just a another step in the way. Doesn’t work 1/10",

      "# Excellent app, 5 stars [(Riva3361, Apple App Store, 2023-10-11)](https://apple/10462020332)\nThis is the best call screening and blocking app I’ve ever had. My phone was inundated with calls all day from telemarketers to campaign people to debtors that were included in my debt consolidation. It got to the point I wanted to keep my phone off. But this app stopped all that almost instantly. As soon as a call came in I didn’t want, I’d click block and that was it, no more calls from that number. I could even simply type in a name or prefix and they would be blocked without exception. There was no delay or exception. I couldn’t recommend this app more for anyone that’s sick of unwanted calls. Whoever developed Hiya is a genius and I’m deeply grateful to you.",

      "# Unclear what it does after iOS 17, 2 stars [(brian.mcgroarty, Apple App Store, 2023-10-06)](https://apple/10445543151)\nAfter iOS 17, Hiya requests a bunch of different setup steps than it had, some of which appear invasive and potentially difficult to undo. Some of it also appears to conflict with iOS 17 call screening. The setup steps don’t appear to take dual sim iPhones into account either.\n\nIf they’re radically changing how the app works, it needs to explain that up front. It also needs to show that it works alongside Apple’s features (if it does). And it’s also long overdue for supporting dual active sims. iPhones have supported dual active sims for years.\n\nGoing to the support site, the FAQ has a bunch of tags that basically blame Apple for missing or incomplete features such as neighbor spoofing not blocking contacts. That’s not terribly professional looking either.",

(âHiyaâ or âWeâ) values your privacy and we have prepared this Privacy Policy (âPolicyâ) to help you understand how we collect, use, and disclose information that we obtain about and from users of our mobile applications, products, services, and corresponding Hiya Websites (collectively, our âAppsâ), and how we use and disclose that information. We explain who we are, why, on what legal basis, and how we process personal information and, if you are the subject of any of the personal information concerned, what rights you have and how to get in touch with us if you need to.\n\nBy accepting our Terms of Service and this Policy and/or using our Apps, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy. Your use of our Apps, which includes any services available through our Apps, is subject to this Policy and our Terms of Service, not including its applicable limitations on damages and the resolution of disputes. Our Terms of Service are incorporated by reference into this Policy.\n\nPlease note that our Apps may contain links to third-party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites and We are not responsible for the information practices of such websites.â\n\nWho are we?\n\nWe are Hiya, Inc. We are the controller in relation to the personal information processed in accordance with this Policy (except where this Policy explains otherwise).\n\nOur details â options to contact us:â\n\nUS Office: Â Â 701 5th Ave, Suite 1200, Seattle, WA 98104 USA\n\nEmail: support@hiya.comâ\n\nFollow this link to contact Hiya Customer Serviceâ\n\nData Protection Officer: dpo@hiya.com\n\nUK Office: The Brew Eagle House (1st floor), 163 City Road, London EC1V 1NR, Contact: Kelly Schmitt\n\nEU/ Hungary office: 1066 Budapest, MozsÃ¡r utca 16, 5th floor, Contact: Lilla Szabo\n\nWhat does the Hiya App do?\n\nThe Hiya App enables users to: (a) identify incoming telephone calls and screen potentially unwanted calls; (b) select call management options for incoming calls by type of caller; (c) look up phone numbers manually or using reverse phone number look up features; (d) automatically forward incoming calls identified by Hiya as a potentially âunknown identity/reputationâ that are either missed or rejected by the user to a voice messaging system hosted by Hiya and accessible through the App.Â\n\nThe App is offered by Hiya on a purely opt-in basis and therefore users would have to affirmatively elect to use it. Similarly, users can disable the App at any time, even after opting in to use it.\n\nWhose personal information do we process?\n\nWe may process personal information relating to you if:\n\nYou use our products or services, especially our Apps.\n\nYour personal information has been provided to us by one of our users. This means that our user granted us access to data stored or otherwise available on or through his/her/their device that includes your personal information, for example data from call and text logs, contacts, and voicemails. When you call one of our users or are called by one of our users, we process your personal information in relation to providing our Apps to our users.\n\nYour personal information has been provided to us by third party sources, including affiliated entities, surveys or questionnaires, marketing companies, data licensors, public records. In such cases, we rely on the guarantees given by these third parties that they have first obtained your consent to provide us with the information, or that there is some other lawful basis for giving us the information.\n\nYou are someone (or you work for someone) to whom we want to advertise or market our services. In this case, we may have obtained your personal information directly from you (for example, via our website) or from another source.\n\nSocial Network User IDs\n\nIn case you are one of our users and access some of our Apps using your social networking account credentials, we may obtain information from Facebook, LinkedIn, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Google+: If you log into our Apps using these social networking accounts, you must enter your social networking account email address and password. We will ask that you grant us permission to your social networking account user IDs which we will use to authenticate you to use our Apps. Since your social network account user ID is unique, we do not have to create a new ID ourselves. Instead, we will use your social network account user ID to identify you as a user in our Apps. If you allow us to have access to your social network account user ID, then our Apps may be visible on your social network page that lists your âapplications.â\n\nWe store your social network account user ID that we receive from your social network account along with other information that we collect from you or receive about you. The third-party social networking site will know that you are a user of our Apps and certain usage information. For information about how the social networks may use and disclose this information, including any information you make public, please consult their respective privacy policies. We have no control over how any third-party site uses or discloses the personal data it collects about you.

If you are under the age of the Minimum Age, you may not download the Apps or use the Apps, you may not use any feature that requires registration, and you may not provide us with any of your personal details. If we discover that a child under the Minimum Age has provided us with personal information, we will delete such information from our systems.\n\nWhat personal information do we process?\n\nWe may obtain information about you in a variety of ways, including when you call, email or otherwise communicate with us (including through social media), or when you participate in events or other promotions. We also collect information given directly by you, by third parties (e.g., data providers, social networks), and automatically as you use our Apps. The personal information relating to you that we process may include the information set out below.\n\nThe information that we collect, whether from you directly or automatically, may be considered personal information in certain jurisdictions or personal data under the European General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\"). Whenever we refer to personal information in this Policy, it means personal information or personal data as defined by applicable laws in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nA key component of our Apps is to assist our users in identifying telephone calls including potentially unwanted telephone calls, as well as automatically forwarding incoming calls we identify as a potentially âunknown identity/reputationâ that are either missed or rejected by the user to a voice messaging system hosted by Hiya. To do so, we may collect call and text log information automatically from our usersâ devices and audio records if a caller leaves our user a voice message.\n\nIn addition, if you sign up to use the App, we may also process the following personal information relating to you:\n\nYour name, phone number, IP address and physical location (minimally your current country)\n\nIf a number is stored in your contacts (only if you grant us access to contacts)\n\nThe number dialing into your device\n\nAudio Recordings (we store call recordings as part of the voice messaging service with our third-party platform, cloud storage or telecom provider). (Note that we do not otherwise share these recordings with third parties)\n\nIf you make data available to us via various social media presences: your user ID\n\nSearch strings when queried from within the App, your location and IP address at time of query\n\nMobile device ID (or other identifier as permitted by the manufacturer or created by Hiya)\n\nMobile carrier\n\nLanguage information\n\nDevice name and model; operating system type, name, and version\n\nYour activities within the App\n\nThe length of time that you may be logged into an App\n\nPayment data, if you subscribe to our Premium Apps\n\nIf you contact us, we will collect whatever information you choose to provide in your correspondence with us often this includes your phone number, email address or other contact details.\n\nWe may combine this information with other information that we have collected about you, including, where applicable, your username, name, and other personal information. Please see âOur Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanismsâ for more information.\n\nUser Generated Content\n\nWe also invite you to contribute information in and on our Apps, including your comments in spam reports, spam category, name corrections and any other information that you would like to be available on our Apps. You also may have the option to send a picture or your location through our Apps to someone you call. These pictures will not be available to all users, only to the receiver of the sent picture. We will not text or call any of your contacts without your explicit consent. If you contribute information to our Apps, your posting may become public and we cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy. In general, if you choose to upload, post, transmit, or otherwise disclose information about other people to us, you confirm that you have the authority to use and share such information.â\n\nWhat do we do with your personal information?\n\nWe may process personal information as necessary to perform our contract with our users, for our or third partiesâ legitimate interests, especially to provide our Apps to you and other users, to assist our users in identifying potentially unwanted telephone calls and handling such calls, including the following:\n\nTo match the information in user phone logs and contacts with numbers from the calls the user makes or receives, as well as with information in our database. We also may store this information for subsequent data validation for both you and other users of our Apps and other products;\n\nTo tailor the content and information that we may send or display to users, to offer location customization, and personalized help and instructions, and to otherwise personalize user experiences while using our Apps;\n\nTo send users push notifications. For example, if you missed a call and the number was not in your address book, but we knew the name of the caller, we may send you a notification;\n\nTo measure or understand the effectiveness of advertising we serve to you and others, and to deliver relevant advertising.\n\nIf you are a paying customer of our Apps, we may process your person data to check/verify your payment methods, related accounting purposes, invoicing, and the prevention of fraud;\n\nIf you contact us, we may process your personal data to communicate with you about your use of our Apps, to respond to your inquiries, and for other user services purposes;\n\nTo better understand how users access and use our Apps, both on an aggregated and individualized basis;\n\nTo improve our Apps, and for research and analytics purposes;\n\nTo administer our Apps, and other systems, including troubleshooting, and data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes;\n\nTo improve our Apps to ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your device;\n\nTo keep our Apps and other systems safe and secure;\n\nWe may process personal information for marketing and promotional purposes based on your consent. For example, we may use your information, such as your email address, to\n\nâ\n\n- send you news and newsletters, special offers, and promotions, or to otherwise contact you about products or\n\n- information we think may interest you. We also may use the information that we learn about you to assist us in advertising our services on third party websites.\n\nIn case you are not one of our users, but you made a call to one of our users or received a call from one of our users, we may process your personal data for the following purposes based on our, our usersâ and third partiesâ legitimate interests:\n\nâ\n\n- To provide information to our users at the moment when you contact one of our users and if you leave a voice message for our users;\n\n- To communicate with you about the information we hold about you, to correct the information that we may display about you and to respond to your inquiries;\n\n- To improve our Apps, and for research and analytics purposes;\n\n- To administer our Apps, and other systems, including troubleshooting, and data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes; and\n\n- To keep our Apps and other systems safe and secure.\n\nTo be able to provide the core, acknowledged feature of our Apps, namely spam and fraud prevention, it is essential to collect certain call-related data not just about our users, but also about the party on the other end of the phone call:\n\nfirstly, because we collect the data automatically and in-real time, therefore it is simply technically not possible to only obtain data about users;\n\nand secondly, to be able to protect our users from spam and fraudulent calls, we need to identify the party on the other end of the phone call as spam or not spam.\n\nWhere we rely on our and our usersâ legitimate interests to identify unwanted callers and protect mobile users from spam and fraudulent calls, we have carried out appropriate legitimate interest assessments (âLIAâ) to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people whose personal data we process. For more details on the LIA please contact us at the following e-mail address: dpo@hiya.com. The LIA is made available to you upon request.\n\nAlso, we are dedicated to provide sufficient information on our data processing in this Policy and ensure adequate and easy access to data subject rights not just for our users but for anyone, whose personal data we collect. If you want to know more about what rights you have or how you can exercise them, please see the Section âWhat are your rights?â and âHow can you exercise your rights?â of this Policy by following this link.\n\nWho do we disclose your personal information to?\n\nAffiliates. We may disclose the information we collect to our affiliates or subsidiaries; however, if we do so, their use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information will be subject to this Policy.\n\nBusiness Users. We may provide your information to business users of our products (e.g., user support centers) so that they can improve their calling operations and marketing practices. For example: We may share your anonymized complaint data with Business Users such as call originators so that they become aware of the nuisance they are causing.\n\nUser of the Apps and Our Other Products. Because your information may be used for validation of information in our database, we may disclose your personal information to users of the Apps and of our other products and services that rely on our database of information. For example: If you provide us with your name and you call another of our users, then we may show your name to the other user to know who is calling.\n\nService Providers. We may disclose the information we collect from you to third party vendors, service providers (customer and marketing support, payment partners, technical partners), contractors, or agents who perform functions on our behalf. For example, if an unknown number has called you and we do not have sufficient information about the number then we may ask a third-party data vendor for help.\n\nBusiness Transfers. If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the information we have collected from you to the other company.\n\nIn Response to Legal Process. We may disclose your information to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena.\n\nTo Protect Us and Others. We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use or this Policy, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved. We may, on a strictly confidential basis, also disclose your information to our legal and professional advisers, where we believe it is necessary for the compliance with laws and the protection of our legal interests.\n\nAggregate and De-Identified Information. We may share aggregated, de-identified information (which is not considered personal data) with third parties for marketing, advertising, research, or similar purposes.\n\nWhat are the legal grounds and purposes for our processing of your personal information?\n\nThe legal bases on which we process your personal information is described below:\n\nWe process your personal information as necessary to perform our contracts with you, or to allow us to take steps at your request prior to entering into such a contract;\n\nIn cases where this is necessary and you give us your consent to the processing of your personal information, we also rely on consent in relation to the processing concerned (see below for how to withdraw your consent at any time).\n\nOtherwise, we will process your personal information where the processing is necessary:\n\nfor the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, our users and third parties to identify unwanted callers and protect mobile users from spam and fraudulent calls;\n\nfor compliance with a legal obligation to which we are a subject;\n\nfor the protection of your vital interests or those of another person;\n\nfor the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, insofar as the processing has a basis in Union or Member State law.\n\nMore specifically, and in some cases in addition to the purposes described above, we may use the information we collect for a variety of other purposes, such as the following:\n\nPerforming Our Services\n\nMaintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, operating our Apps; processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying user information, processing payments;\n\nCommunicating about the products and services we offer, and responding to requests, inquiries, comments, and suggestions;\n\nProviding social or community features including publicly displaying comments that you voluntarily post;\n\nInternal Research\n\nUnderstanding and evaluating how our Apps and features perform with our users;\n\nUncovering insights about usage in order to improve the Apps and provide customers with enhanced features as well as inform our development of new features and products;\n\nDevelopment of customized or personalized experiences of our Apps, such as remembering your information, so you do not have to re-enter it each time you use one of our Apps;\n\nUsing proprietary automated methods of analysis, we use voicemail recordings and transcripts to determine spam and unwanted calls and improve our blocking technology;\n\nAuditing Interactions with Our Users\n\nMeasuring usage of our Apps;\n\nMeasuring our advertising and marketing activity (e.g., measuring how a user was acquired)\n\nSecurity\n\nProviding our users with a secure experience and to take measures to protect our Apps from cyber risks;\n\nProtecting against, identifying, investigating, preventing, and responding to fraud, illegal activity (such as incidents of hacking or misuse of our websites and mobile applications), and claims and other liabilities, including by enforcing the terms and conditions that govern the Apps we provide;\n\nDebugging/Repair\n\nIdentification and repair of impairments to intended, existing functionality of our Apps;\n\nMarketing, including understanding users in order to more effectively market our Apps;\n\nWe use your email (with your consent where required) to send you information about our Apps and exclusive offers;\n\nQuality and Safety Maintenance and Verification\n\nActivities related to improving the quality of the Apps we provide, including upgrade or enhancement of the Apps;\n\nVerification or maintenance of the quality or safety of Apps;\n\nTracking and responding to quality and safety matters;\n\nProtecting our rights and property\n\nComplying with legal or regulatory requirements, judicial process, industry standards, and our company policies;\n\nOther purposes that may be described at the time you choose to provide personal information to us.\n\nWe may also aggregate and/or de-identify any information that we collect, such that the information no longer identifies any specific individual.

      "# [Robocalling is already an issue for Americans. AI is making it worse by Rachel Curry, www.facebook.com on 2023-10-21](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/21/robocalling-is-already-an-issue-for-americans-ai-is-making-it-worse.html)\nBy now, many of us know that tax bureaus, auto warranty companies and the like won't call us with urgent fines or fees we must pay in the form of prepaid cards. Yet, the nearly $300 million fine against a massive transnational robocalling operation by the Federal Communications Commission shows just how widespread this issue has become.\n\nBut what about when the voice of someone you know is on the other line — your CEO, spouse, or grandkid — urgently requesting money to help get them out of a pickle?\n\nWith the insidious use of generative artificial intelligence mimicking the voice of someone you know and communicating with you in real-time, that call becomes inherently untrustworthy.\n\nThe phone system was one built on trust, says Jonathan Nelson, director of product management at telephony analytics and software company Hiya Inc. \"We used to be able to assume that if your phone rang, there was a physical copper wire that we could follow all the way between those two points, and that disappeared,\" Nelson said. \"But the trust that it implied didn't.\"\n\nNow, the only call that you can trust is the one that individuals initiate. But with a quarter of all non-contact calls reported as spam — meaning fraudulent or simply a nuisance — according to Hiya's Global Call Threat Report for Q2 2023, that's a lot of verification.\n\nA report on AI and cybersecurity from digital security company McAfee says that 52% of Americans share their voice online, which gives scammers the main ingredient for creating a digitally generated version of your voice to victimize people you know. This is called an interactive voice response (IVR) and it's used in a type of spam called voice phishing or \"vishing.\" While spear phishing once took a lot of time and money, Nelson said, \"generative AI can kind of take what used to be a really specialized spam attack and make it much more commonplace.\"\n\nAccording to McAfee's CTO Steve Grobman, these types of calls are bound to remain less likely than other, more obvious spam calls, at least for the time being. However, \"they're putting the victim in a more tenuous situation where they're more likely to act, which is why it's important to be prepared,\" Grobman said.\n\nThat preparation depends on a combination of consumer education and the war between technologies, or more specifically, white-hat AI fighting black-hat AI.\n\nCompanies like McAfee and Hiya are on the front lines of this fight, spotting AI scam patterns (such as historical call patterns that function similar to a credit history for phone numbers) and finding ways to obstruct them.\n\nDespite the fact that the U.S. federal government spearheaded the IRS scam investigation (refer to the 2023 podcast Chameleon: Scam Likely for an inhalable deep dive into the logistics of the investigation), its response to AI technology's augmentation of robocalling is disorganized, one expert says.\n\nKristofor Healey is a former special agent for the Department of Homeland Security who now works in the private sector as CEO of Black Bear Security Consultants. He spent his time in the federal government investigating large scale money laundering organizations and led the team that took down the IRS scam, the largest telefraud case in U.S. history.\n\nHealey says the government and law enforcement are inherently reactive systems, but that AI as a tool for businesses such as call centers (\"whether they are good call centers or bad call centers,\" he said), are going to multiply the cases that must be reacted upon.\n\nUltimately, technology can only be so proactive because cybercriminals always take things to the next level. Business and consumer education is the only truly proactive approach available, experts say, and it requires getting the word out about how people can protect themselves and those around them.\n\nFor businesses, this may mean incorporating education on deepfake audio spam calls as part of required employee cybersecurity training. For individuals, it could mean being more discerning about what you post online. Grobman said, \"Sometimes risky behavior will have a higher likelihood of impacting someone around you than impacting you directly.\" Criminals could use what we post on social media in an AI-generated voice-cloned call as a way to gain rapport with other victims.\n\nMeanwhile, identity protection and personal data cleanup services will continue to be useful for consumers. Policies around how employees must behave when receiving a non-contact call and what they share online — even on their personal profiles — could become increasingly commonplace.\n\nGrobman recommends that families come up with a duress word or validation word that they can use to ensure it's really a loved one on the other line. It's like a spoken password; much like digital passwords, avoid using the name of your pets or children, or any information that is readily available.\n\nWhat if someone calls stating they're from a company? Hang up, look up the company's contact information (don't just call back the number that called you), and call it yourself for verification. \"It's incredibly important to validate independently through a trusted channel,\" Grobman said.\n\nFor his part, Healey acts as a sort of telefraud vigilante, always picking up the phone when a spam number shows up on the screen. He doesn't give them any confirming information, nor tells them who he is or any information about himself. He simply keeps them on the line as long as possible, costing them money as their voice-over-IP technology is at work.\n\n\"Keeping them on the phone is an effective way to prevent them from harming someone else,\" said Healey.\n\nThe widespread IRS scam that Healey investigated and the podcast Chameleon: Scam Likely covered had tangible implications on victims — shame, loss of financial security, loss of relationships, even loss of life. To the trained ear, spam calls can sound silly, but people like the elderly or those who are in vulnerable states of mind have fallen, and continue to fall, for the charade.\n\nWith the use of AI technology mimicking the voices of our acquaintances, friends or loved ones, the game becomes more ingrained in the psyche. And it is a game. At some point, Chameleon notes, it ceases to be about the money, but rather the achievement, adrenaline, and power. But while education on this ever-evolving threat makes its rounds, technology helps to fight back.",
      "# [UConn physics department news by Michael Rozman, Cara Battersby, Quentin Kessel, Luchang Jin, Richard Jones, Zhanna Rodnova, Kevin Watson, Jason Hancock on 2023-07-17](https://physics.uconn.edu/category/news/page/3/)\nA recent publication by Geoffrey Harrison, Tobias Saule, Brandin Davis, and Carlos Trallero from the Department of Physics, University of Connecticut is featured in Advances in Engineering. The publication presents a novel method for mitigating the bit-depth limit by increasing the phase precision of the Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs). The technique is based on adding irrational linear slopes in addition to the desired phase to increase the device’s effective bit-depth through an effect similar to volume averaging. The research is published in Applied Optics.\n\nSpatial light modulators (SLMs) are devices that can modulate properties of light waves, such as phase, amplitude and polarization. SLMs are extensively used in numerous applications, including data storage, material processing and optical microscopy. With the widespread application of SLMs, the need to address the bit-depth and spatial resolution problems common to most SLMs is urgent.\n\nThe publication by Prof. Trallero’s group presented a technique for overcoming the bit-depth limitations of SLMs and verified it experimentally. The authors expressed confidence that the presented method could be used to gain multiple orders of magnitude with more precision beyond what was measured and obtained in their study.\n\nAbout Advances in Engineering: Advances in Engineering ensures that the results of excellent scientific research are rapidly disseminated throughout the world, in a fashion that conveys their significance for advancing scientific knowledge and developing innovative technologies. Content is mainly targeted to an educated audience of engineering and physics students, scientists, and professors. Engineering fields covered are Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Materials Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Nanotechnology Engineering as well as General Engineering (aerospace Engineering, communication Engineering, computer Engineering, Agricultural Engineering, and Industrial Engineering).\n\nFrederick Edward Steigert, of Westerly, RI passed away surrounded by the love of his family on Monday, May 29, 2023. He was the husband of Judith Carol (Lance) Steigert. Born in New York, New York on September 11, 1928, he was the son of the late Karl and Margarete (Shuppert) Steigert.\n\nFrederick was a dedicated teacher and scholar. He was educated at Union College in Schenectady, New York. He received his PHD in Nuclear Physics at the University of Indiana. He was Director of Undergraduate Studies at Yale University followed by a career teaching and as an advising professor at the University of Connecticut where he was beloved by his students to whom he was a mentor. Frederick was an avid runner, storyteller and a dedicated historian. He served on the school board of Amity Regional High School in Woodbridge, Connecticut. He was a volunteer fireman in Bethany, Connecticut. He loved carpentry and masonry.\n\nBesides his loving wife Judith Steigert, he leaves behind his daughters Heidi Polhemus and Cassandra Olesen. He also is survived by his sons Frederick W. Steigert and Richard E. Steigert and many grandchildren and great grandchildren. He was predeceased by his daughter Christine Spencer.\n\nAll services will be held privately at the convenience of the family.\n\nThe Department of Physics is hosting UConn-NSF summer school on Parton Saturation and Electron Ion Collider (EIC). The School will take place in Storrs, from August 1 to August 10, 2023. The school chair is Professor Alex Kovner. The school website can be found at https://www.phys.uconn.edu/Conferences/saturation-eic/.\n\nThe Electron-Ion Collider is the next big experiment in high-energy nuclear physics. It is going to address a plethora of questions about the structure of protons and nuclei. One of the main exciting phenomena that it is intended to clarify is the manifestations of parton saturation. This has been predicted to occur in hadrons at high energy as well as in nuclei at lower energies. Although tantalizing hints of saturating behavior have been observed at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in Brookhaven National Lab and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, no cut-and-dry experimental case has been made for it yet. We hope that the experiments on nuclei at EIC will provide a convincing case for saturation. Another important aspect of EIC physics is scattering on polarized proton beams, which should improve our understanding of the so-called “proton spin crisis”.\n\nThe school is intended to graduate students and postdocs who want to extend their physics horizons or plan to pursue research in this or related areas. A preliminary list of lecturers at the school includes A. Mueller (Columbia), O.Hen (MIT), N. Armesto (Santiago de Campostela), A. Dumitru (CUNY, Baruch College), Yu. Kovchegov (Ohio State), L. Jin (UConn), V. Skokov (North Carolina State), B. Schenke (BNL). The schedule of lectures is available on the school website at https://www.phys.uconn.edu/Conferences/saturation-eic/\n\nJeff Schweitzer passed away unexpectedly last year on May 31, 2022 in his home in Ridgefield, CT. Jeff was a faculty member in the physics department for 25 years (1997-2022). Jeff earned his B.S. in Physics from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (1967), and his M.S. (1969) and Ph.D. (1972) in physics from the Purdue University conducting research in low-energy nuclear physics. After his postdoctoral research at the California Institute of Technology (1972–1974) he worked as scientific advisor at Schlumberger-Doll Research (1974–1996) where he employed his expertise in nuclear experimental techniques to applications in geology and developed several patents. Jeff served for 35 years on the editorial boards of the Journal of Nuclear Geophysics (1987-1993) and Applied Isotopes and Radiation (1993-2022). A skilled nuclear experimental physicist, Jeff applied his expertise to a wide variety of fields: from fundamental experimental nuclear physics, to astrophysics, to studies of the nanoscale kinetics in cement chemistry, to instrumentation development with applications in medical physics, forensic science, and planetary mission satellites and landers.\n\nJeff taught at the Waterbury campus for several years, and was a devoted mentor for his students. At UConn, he was the PhD advisor for Nada Jevtic (Phd 2003) who is now faculty at the Bloomsburg University, Tim Spillane (PhD 2008) who works now as data scientist at Hiya Inc, and James Zickefoose (PhD 2011) who is now Senior Research Scientist at Mirion Technologies, Inc. in Meriden, CT. Jeff was the mentor and co-advisor for many more PhD students including Fridah Mokaya who was Jeff’s most recent advisee. Jeff also mentored junior UConn faculty including Howard Winston and Peter Schweitzer (not related to Jeff despite the same last name).\n\nHoward Winston recalls that Jeff went out of his way to help him during his early days at UConn. He was extraordinarily generous with his time explaining his teaching philosophy and sharing course materials. While doing so, Jeff was never overly didactic. He enjoyed talking about areas where his approaches could be customized or improved. Jeff loved to keep in touch to see how things were going. In common with others, Howard misses his warm smile and sage advice.\n\nFridah Mokaya recalls: “I will forever treasure this memory as it is a constant reminder of Jeff’s dedication as an advisor and mentor. Jeff greatly influenced the career path I took, I remember when I was not certain of what to do or which path to take post graduation, his words of wisdom and guidance enabled me Identify my strength and passion. He was not only an advisor and mentor but also a great friend, who would constantly call, text, email and visit to check on how everything was progressing. I will greatly miss his advice and words of wisdom.” The picture taken after Fridah’s PhD defense shows Jeff Schweitzer (second from the right) together with Fridah, her husband and daughter (middle), Richard Jones (left, main advisor) and Peter Schweitzer (right, associate advisor).\n\nMore information about Jeff can be found in the news article of the Institute of Materials Science, in Jeff’s obituary and in the article in the journal Applied Radiation and Isotopes. Many of Jeff’s articles and scientific contributions can be found on the Research Gate website.\n\nGalaxy clusters are the most massive objects in the Universe: a single cluster contains anything from a hundred to many thousands of galaxies, alongside collections of plasma, hot X-ray emitting gas, and dark matter. These components are held together by the cluster’s own gravity. Understanding such galaxy clusters is crucial to pinning down the origin and continuing evolution of our universe. An article recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences describes using of machine learning algorithms to solve a fundamental problem in astrophysics: inferring the mass of galaxy clusters. “Measuring how many clusters exist, and then what their masses are, can help us understand fundamental properties like the total matter density in the universe, the nature of dark energy, and other fundamental questions,” says co-author and UConn Professor of Physics Daniel Anglés-Alcázar.\n\nFor more information about the research, check UConn Today article at https://today.uconn.edu/2023/04/astrophysicists-show-how-to-weigh-galaxy-clusters-with-artificial-intelligence/\n\nA University chapter of Optica (formerly known as OSA), the largest professional society for Optics and Photonics, has started at UConn. Physics graduate students Zhanna Rodnova and Kevin Watson, and Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate student Gokul Krishnan started the chapter in the Fall of 2022 to help students, undergraduate, and graduate, learn more about the world of optics and the professional opportunities within the field. Chapter of Optica, UConn is also organizing tours of laser and optics companies to give students further insight into possible careers after graduation. Additionally, the Optica Chapter holds social events, with the next social on Wednesday, April 12th at 6:30 pm at Hops 44, where everyone is welcome to learn more about optics and photonics research.\n\nOn April 21st, the Chapter will host its first Traveling Lecturer.

      "# [Department of Physics by Richard Jones on 2024-05-04](https://physics.uconn.edu/author/rtj02001/)\nOnce used for education and outreach for UConn faculty, students, and community members, the planetarium fell into disuse in the last several years, but Department of Physics Assistant Professor-in-Residence Matt Guthrie has been working hard with skilled facilities staff, including CLAS Facilities Team Leader Brett DeMarchi, to bring this piece of UConn history back into working order.\n\nThe planetarium was built in 1954 and has served since as a hub for sharing astronomical information with UConn and surrounding communities. The late Professor Cynthia Peterson was the planetarium’s curator for many years; it was her favorite place on campus, and she regularly shared her enthusiasm for astronomy by hosting events there.\n\nIn 2022, when Guthrie first toured the facility with Physics Department Academic Assistant Dave Perry, they were not sure what they would find and felt it was a shame the facility had fallen into disrepair. With encouragement from fellow physics faculty members Jon Trump and then Department Head Professor Barry Wells, Guthrie decided to take the project on, and together with Perry, DeMarchi, and others, they have been slowly but surely bringing the venerable planetarium back into campaigning shape.\n\n“When I first toured the facility, it was still my first year at UConn full-time and I was looking for a project to dedicate all my free time to,” Guthrie says. “From the start, as I was doing research about it and learning more about Cynthia, I felt a sense of responsibility that if I was going to fill at least part of the hole that was left after she retired, we needed the proper recognition for everything that she had done, especially with the planetarium.”\n\nThe first time DeMarchi walked into the dome, he says it was like stepping back in time:\n\n“It was almost pitch black and the antique projector was covered in dust — a unique piece of history to marvel at from a time when technology was much simpler!”\n\nDeMarchi says a previous project study with a larger scope had a budget that was unfeasible, but he had some ideas to help keep the costs down while still freshening up the facility without major renovations to the existing structure. A new proposal was submitted to CLAS, accepted, and with funding, the project moved ahead.\n\nGuthrie wanted to be sure the history of the planetarium was preserved, so, in the process of clearing out the facility to make way for new equipment, the team kept whatever they could for posterity, including the original A1 Spitz star and planet projector.\n\n“We put the old projector on display in the physics department to make sure that we are not rewriting the history of the planetarium. That has been the guiding light for how I approach this project. We did buy a new projector, but we’re not changing the internal structure of the building,” says Guthrie.\n\nShortly after starting this project, Guthrie also started working on the UConn Observatory and both projects have kept him very busy, but he says he is glad to be able to dedicate the time to get these resources back up and running for the department and community.\n\nGuthrie also has student help, including Danya Alboslani (CLAS) ’24 who has helped with both renovation processes.\n\nAlboslani first got involved as a sophomore wanting to learn more about the planetarium and observatory that no one seemed to have details about,\n\n“I wanted to get more information about the planetarium on campus. UConn is a great school with astronomy professors who do amazing work, so if we have a planetarium and an alleged observatory, why don’t we use them?”\n\nAlboslani connected with Guthrie and says working with him on the restoration projects has been amazing,\n\n“Ever since I first contacted him, he’s made me feel very involved in the entire process. Professor Guthrie went out of his way to keep me updated on everything. I helped to write the memorial plaque about Professor Peterson — also a woman in STEM and UConn’s first women physics professor.”\n\nA tricky issue was the planetarium’s 16-foot dome, which had to be resealed, but once that was resolved, Guthrie said the interior work could go ahead. Though it has been a slow process, Guthrie says the end is in sight. The internal painting was completed in January and the external painting will be done as soon as the weather warms up.\n\nDeMarchi says the team is very appreciative of the extensive collaborative efforts from UConn Facilities Operations.\n\n“Every Facilities Shop Supervisor that I contacted was on board to assist. Special thanks to Nate Bedard of Interior Renewals for his help with project coordination and flooring. Chris Gisleson and his team put a lot of effort into sealing the exterior of the dome. Jon Cooke researched the correct reflective paint needed for the interior of the dome and his team painted the structure. Jennifer Peshka provided testing and compliance guidance throughout. CLAS Shared Services student workers Cole Shillington (CLAS) ‘24 and Alex Gervais (CAHNR) ‘24 were a big help with various tasks that came up.”\n\nThough they don’t have a firm launch date yet, Guthrie hopes they will be up and running by summertime. The team plans to install carpeting and purchase new chairs soon. Guthrie says they removed the old projector platform, which was about six feet in diameter, and Perry and Senior Machine Shop Engineer Machinist Ray Celmer are working to make a sturdy stand that will have a small 18-inch footprint which will allow for more flexibility and accessibility in the space.\n\n“Newer planetariums are structuring their seating charts as if there is a front of the building, and that’s where they project the main action of the show, where other things can happen around you,” Guthrie says. “We have the possibility of moving around to make it so that there is a front of the room. That depends on what we want to do and how the building evolves to meet our needs. I wanted to leave that possibility open.”\n\nWhen deciding on what new projector to order, Guthrie says he chose a company that specializes in portable planetarium projectors, because other than being the oldest planetarium in the state, this is likely the state’s smallest permanent planetarium.\n\n“I went with this projector model because it’s perfect for the size of our dome. The new projector gives users access to around 100,000 pre-made shows, and a bonus is the software is easy to learn so users can write their own planetarium shows. What I’m hoping is that interested astronomy students will be able to lead outreach events with shows they have designed themselves and if they want to get involved it will be lower stress to learn how to use the projector within this cool piece of UConn history.”\n\nPhysics Ph.D. student Kelcey Davis is eager for the facility to open and says the astrophysics graduate students and faculty are all very passionate about what they do and are excited this project will provide the opportunity to engage with the public.\n\n“I saw the projector for the first time just a few days ago and have driven it once. It’s operated by a video game controller, so it helps to be a nerd!” says Davis.\n\nDavis works with the James Webb Space Telescope and hopes to develop shows that break down the big discoveries the telescope has made since first light and make them digestible to a broader audience.\n\n“I’m excited to showcase some of the research I and others in the department are doing. NASA has come out with some cool visuals, and I’d love to share them. A great example is the flight to ‘Maisie’s galaxy,’ the most distant galaxy in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS), which I work on. The light from this galaxy traveled 13.4 billion light years to reach us.”\n\nGuthrie also has ideas for shows: for example, a simulated rocket launch. The projector can show the flight through clouds and the atmosphere and once the sound system is installed, viewers can feel what it’s like to blast off. Guthrie says he is planning to hold at least one show per week once everything is up and running, as long as the demand is there.\n\n“What I once thought I wouldn’t be able to see before I graduate is now slowly becoming a reality,” says Alboslani. “With Professor Guthrie leading the restoration of the planetarium and observatory, I know that he will make an impact on the community and the university for years to come.”\n\nGuthrie is excited for the future with both the observatory and the planetarium back in action.\n\n“The observatory has incredible potential for completely changing the way that we do astrophysics research at UConn and the planetarium is completely different, but also super exciting. I can’t wait to see what this building is capable of.”\n\nThe project was made possible thanks to funding from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. The Planetarium schedule will be updated with events once the facility is up and running. You can also keep up with events via Instagram.\n\n|",
