I know they're all the same price, but for my use it would offer a classic look with less slippage. \n\nI'm planning on buying black RMs and a dark brown pair of boots from an alternative RM type company. I've only ever owned Florsheims and Wild Rhinos. Both not great build quality and I replace them every 1-2 years for $150+\n\n## Comment ID i9iszbt with +10 score by [(Thomascowza, Reddit, 2022-05-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianMFA/comments/uuf6gk/what_are_the_differences_between_all_the_rm/i9iszbt/) (in reply to ID uuf6gk):\nA few things I have learnt regarding the different models - I have a pair of classics and a pair of comforts.\n\n**The Classics**\n\n* The classics do not have a padded insole. I would *not* recommend these if you are going to be doing any walking or long periods of standing in them (i.e. to or from a bus or something).\n* The heel has an embossed RM logo inside which I feel dig into my heel and is quite uncomfortable. The shank also starts to come through after time which you can also feel. I have sent them away to be checked and they told me there was no defect and that's how its all supposed to be.\n* You can add your own insole but keep in mind the the fit will be tighter. \n\n**The Comfort**\n\n* Much more comfortable as the name suggests and suitable for wearing all day and a bit of walking if needed\n* Has padded insoles but they aren't removeable. \n* The fit is actually a bit looser than the classic. This extra room makes you more prone to rubbing and blisters if you end up walking a bit in them - for me its around the outside of my pinky toe. I actually prefer the snugger fit of the classics in this respect.\n\n I think your decision to go with comforts is a good one. I would never go for the classics again.\n\n### Comment ID i9ivplt with +4 score by [(myfriendknowsall, Reddit, 2022-05-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianMFA/comments/uuf6gk/what_are_the_differences_between_all_the_rm/i9ivplt/) (in reply to ID i9iszbt):\nThanks mate for the detailed synopsis on this, really appreciated it.\n\nI've been researching this purchase for over a month (it's a big spend amount for me even though I can afford it).\n\nJust curious, I am thinking of getting the black pair of Comforts, and a dark brown pair of a cheaper alternative boot. What would you recommend? The ones I've found so far are:\n\nhttps://www.koolstuff.com.au/products/thomas-cook-trentham-mens-dress-boots-chestnut.html\n\nhttps://everythingaustralian.com.au/harold-boots-grazier-chocolate.html\n\nThe reason being, I plan to wear the black ones for work, but I do a bit of walking at work (CBD, but sometimes I'm on site as I work in commercial property).\n\nFor site visits I will opt for the brown pair of alternative \"beater\" RMs, and black ones for client contact and office wear.\n\n#### Comment ID i9j9e51 with +3 score by [(Thomascowza, Reddit, 2022-05-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianMFA/comments/uuf6gk/what_are_the_differences_between_all_the_rm/i9j9e51/) (in reply to ID i9ivplt):\nI’m not familiar with either boot but based purely on description I would go with the Harold since they mention it can “go a few rounds in the cattle yard”. Both shoes look good from a visual POV. \n\nI did notice the Harold uses yearling leather (similar to RM) whereas the TC uses calf. I don’t know much comparatively about each leather but the yearling leather that RM uses is actually very easy to scuff. I have various that I haven’t been able to polish out - example: when I was resting my feet on top of each other under the desk at work I switched feet and nicked one shoe with the other heel and this was enough.\n\nI’d get yourself the black comforts, then hopefully the other brands have a guarantee or return policy and you can try them on at home and see how the feel and leather compares then return the ones you don’t like.\n\n#### Comment ID i9jsvv7 with +2 score by [(sageco, Reddit, 2022-05-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianMFA/comments/uuf6gk/what_are_the_differences_between_all_the_rm/i9jsvv7/) (in reply to ID i9ivplt):\nThe steel shank will mean it triggers alarms at the airport.\n\n#### Comment ID l4m70dw with +1 score by [(cab1024, Reddit, 2024-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianMFA/comments/uuf6gk/what_are_the_differences_between_all_the_rm/l4m70dw/) (in reply to ID i9ivplt):\nIf you want relatively cheap, I  have a pair of these and they are insanely comfortable:\n\nhttps://everythingaustralian.com.au/blundstone-1900-ankle-boot-chestnut-brown.html\n\n## Comment ID i9f4n1y with +7 score by [(glebe9, Reddit, 2022-05-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianMFA/comments/uuf6gk/what_are_the_differences_between_all_the_rm/i9f4n1y/) (in reply to ID uuf6gk):\nSomething worth mentioning in addition to the  comments above, is that with Dynamic Flex you can take out and replace the insole.

(the irritation is tolerable, but not sustainable) Other than that, they are perfect in fit and comfort.. \n\nSo back to the original story ..\n\nFrom my extensive googling, it looks like there may potentially be a fibreglass piece in the toe box. \n\nWould RM under their repair capability, or most likely a cobbler be able to take out this fibreglass and shorten it so it’s just leather above my big toe? (Ultimately need maybe 2-4cm trimmed off the reinforcement)\n\nOr would this risk completely destroying the boot? \n\nOver to you guys before I make a dick of myself taking it to a cobbler .\n\n\n\n## Comment ID lbkst0j with +2 score by [(Ccb0115, Reddit, 2024-07-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RMWilliams/comments/1dv191e/tambo_toe_box/lbkst0j/) (in reply to ID 1dv191e):\nYour research is right, but removing it would essentially leave you with a leather sock on the top of the toe, so there wouldn’t be anything to keep the shape of the boot. You might look into having someone reshape the synthetic material to allow more room. Generally that would be a proprietary exercise, meaning RM would have to do the work. But I don’t think they’ll have anything roomier than that since it’s their most generous last. Certainly wouldn’t hurt to try. But if you have a cobbler you trust to do the work, they may have something they can use that wouldn’t require going into the construction. Depending on where you live, someone at RM might recommend an authorized repairer.\n\n## Comment ID lbkklhd with +1 score by [(ambaal, Reddit, 2024-07-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RMWilliams/comments/1dv191e/tambo_toe_box/lbkklhd/) (in reply to ID 1dv191e):\nThermaformed plastic, very thin sheet of it.

Last time I inquired about international plans (not SIMS) it was hundreds of dollars per device… Ya, no. I’d rather get a new SIM in Kenya if need be, just trying to sort out those details. I went to Europe in November & swapping out for a 30 days SIM was painless so I’m hoping to repeat that process on this trip. \n\n\nIs MTN or Vodacom available in Kenya do you know?\n\n\nEDIT: I looked into an international SIM just now (never heard of them before & assumed incorrectly in my title post as that was talking about local SIMS for travellers) & it’s really not for me. The OneSim seems overly complicated & risky as I’m not spending my travel time dealing with customer service if I have an issue. Reviews are pretty bad, too. Expensive! I’d rather just buy a different local SIM when I land in Kenya. But thank you!

Both MTN and Vodacom (two biggest carriers in SA) are at the airport. Telkom is not, other smaller carriers are not either.\n\nVodacom and MTN gauge the customers coming in at the airport. Normally you can get a SIM card for R10 and then add as much data or voice as you like. It’s easy to buy and you can purchase at any supermarket directly.\n\nThe shops at the airport gauge the customers by only offering large packages. So you can’t just buy a sim like you would at any other shop. It’s ridiculous and has no reason other than to force tourists to pay more where they don’t have to.\nThe airport has 1 hour free WiFi, so when you land you can get online to inform family or people collecting you.\nIf you can hold off it’s best to wait till you are out of the airport and purchase at a MTN or Vodacom shop outside of the airport.\nNote the packages are not astronomical, so it might be within your budget, especially as our Monopoly money will be peanuts for you.\n\nBut regarding the two carriers\n\nVodacom - best network in cities. Generally 4G or 5G wherever you go. Rural areas out of the cities is ok but can have spotty signal.\n\nMTN - focuses on rural outreach so you will have 3G or 4G in most parts of SA when you are out of the city. City signal is good but not as good as Vodacom.\n\nTelkom - Cheapest internet but worst signal. Rural areas, forget about it.\n\nCell C - they piggyback off the other carriers so generally you have signal, but their speeds are always bad because the other carriers put them at slower speeds to give priority to their customers.\n\n### Comment ID iiiofci with +1 score by [(customerservicevoice, Reddit, 2022-08-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/johannesburg/comments/wd76ch/where_to_buy_international_sim_card_or_tambo/iiiofci/) (in reply to ID iiinx97):\nI pay $233/CAD /month for 2 plans in Ontario.

I know in the old days they would play the tambo into their vocal mic, but now I often see someone running around the stage with some hand percussion and still get pretty consistent audio on it with no clearly visible mic. How are you handling this? Would you pin a lav mic or a 4099 discreetly on their chest with it's own wireless pack?

      "# [In the Field with Dr. Erick Tambo: Advancing Smart Agriculture in Niger on 2025-01-17](https://unu.edu/vie/news/field-dr-erick-tambo-advancing-smart-agriculture-niger)\nWho: Dr. Erick Rostand Gankam Tambo, Head of Pan-African Cooperation and Educational Technologies (PACET)\n\nWhen: 21–25 October 2024\n\nWhere: Niamey, Niger\n\nWhy: To foster innovation in agriculture using IoT and solar-powered solutions for sustainable development.\n\nThrough their RETO-DOSSO project, Dr. Tambo and his colleagues of the PACET division aim to transform rural Niger by using solar energy, weather information and Internet of Things (IoT) based solutions to improve access to water, boost agriculture and support businesses. The Internet of Things refers to connected devices (sensors) that collect and share data to optimize processes, such as smart irrigation and plant health monitoring systems. In October 2024, Dr. Tambo travelled to Niamey where a “hackathon” launched the RETO-DOSSO Living Lab, which is an open, collaborative space where stakeholders co-create and test innovative solutions in real-world settings. During this event, participants developed technologies to support local agri-tech entrepreneurs and enhance economic opportunities. We sat down with Dr. Tambo to learn more about this valuable mission.\n\nWhat is a hackathon and what was its purpose in this setting?\n\nA hackathon is a competitive event where teams collaborate to develop solutions for specific challenges, often integrating theoretical knowledge and practical skills. Participants design and pitch prototypes addressing issues in a defined domain, such as smart agriculture, which uses advanced technologies like IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data analytics to optimize farming practices. In the hackathon, teams tackled subdomains of smart agriculture, such as irrigation, weather monitoring and regulation in greenhouses, farm security and pest management, combining expertise in agriculture, computer science and electronics. The goal was to create innovative, marketable solutions, evaluated based on feasibility and impact. Winners could receive grants or support for further development, fostering entrepreneurship and innovation in smart agriculture.\n\nWhat were the most creative solutions that were developed?\n\nThe hackathon produced innovative solutions tailored to local challenges, including an AI-driven pest management system using cameras to monitor and address infestations, a smart irrigation system and a greenhouse ventilation solution. The winner, whose solution focused on smart irrigation, stood out by effectively addressing all evaluation criteria and delivering a convincing pitch, but the competition was close. Other solutions were highly innovative and could have won as well. The event highlighted not only creativity but also the importance of practicality and strong presentation skills in developing solutions that meet local needs, which is how the winner came out on top.\n\nFurthermore, by introducing modern agricultural technologies and solutions, the event promoted efficiency and innovation in agriculture. These solutions not only aim to improve livelihoods but also provide a transformative approach to farming, addressing unemployment and enhancing agricultural productivity. The ideas developed have the potential to be widely used, and they can therefore benefit both local and broader communities, for example through the Living Lab: an open, collaborative space where stakeholders co-create and test innovative solutions.\n\nHow can local organizations continue the work of the Living Lab and what key factors will determine the lab’s success?\n\nTo ensure the Living Lab’s continued success, maintaining a collaborative environment is essential. For example, local organizations and other stakeholders are able to use both the physical infrastructure, such as sensors and irrigation systems, as well as the digital tools, such as dashboards for collection and analysis of sensor and weather data. Additional key factors for the Lab’s success include providing access to open-source Smart-Agri Hack Kits or frameworks – consisting of the data dashboard and e-learning resources – and an environment for the organization of future hackathons. The Lab’s replicable model allows it to expand to other regions, with the methodology and materials from the hackathon available for adoption. Ongoing research collaborations will also be crucial in refining agricultural solutions and addressing complex issues, such as the integration of open source crop-models into the dashboard for crop-specific irrigation for their respective growing phase and local weather conditions.\n\nWhat aspects of this field mission were particularly meaningful to you?\n\nAs head of the academic section, I am typically focused on management, so being in the field with the youth was a refreshing and engaging change. I was particularly impressed by the start-up innovators SaraTech we collaborated with, as well as the local partners CIPMEN and the WASCAL programme in Niger for the setup of the living lab and organization of the hackathon. They are already making significant strides in educating people in Niger about IoT in agriculture, using kits to teach students how to design technology from scratch. Their passion and resourcefulness were truly inspiring. While they face challenges like relying on international production, with the right local support, they have the potential to scale their work, create jobs and improve livelihoods for people in Niger and beyond.",

      "# [Red Lodge Mountain faces lift safety concerns after passenger fall by Charlie Klepps, www.ktvq.com, charlie-klepps on 2025-03-11](https://www.ktvq.com/news/local-news/red-lodge-mountain-faces-lift-safety-concerns-after-passenger-fall)\nRED LODGE — Questions are swirling about the safety of the chairlifts on Red Lodge Mountain after a passenger fell from the Triple Chair on Monday.\n\nAccording to officials at the ski area, the person was thrown from the chair just before noon due to high winds and flown by emergency helicopter to a Billings hospital.\n\nWatch video here:\n\nRed Lodge Mountain faces lift safety concerns after passenger fall\n\nOn Tuesday, Interim General Manager Spencer Weimer said they are actively investigating what happened.\n\n\"We ended up in an unseated passenger situation,\" Weimer said. \"We’re still in an investigation of the full situation, so that's really all I can say.\"\n\nBillings skier Robert Tambo was on one of the chairs with his son when the lift shut down.\n\n\"I've honestly never seen it that windy before,\" Tambo said Tuesday. \"I'm not too fond of heights and then shaking around was not a fun experience.\"\n\nTambo and many others were stuck on the lift for more than 30 minutes until ski patrol helped each visitor rappel from their chair one by one.\n\n\"Once I heard that someone fell off, or then I heard the chair had possibly derailed, then I was thinking, okay, what about the rest of the lift?\" Tambo said. \"Like what if our chair isn't safe?\"\n\nTambo said it was a frightening situation that he never could have imagined.\n\n“The most terrifying aspect of it was having a child sitting next to me, worrying about if he’s okay,\" Tambo said. \"I’m trying to keep my cool and make sure he’s okay.\"\n\nThe Triple Chair remained closed all day Tuesday, but it isn't the only lift the mountain is missing. The Willow Creek lift has been out of operation for two weeks due to a previous incident involving a chair that nearly detached from the system. Fortunately, no skiers were on the lift at that time.\n\nWeimer said the mountain is currently checking every chair on Willow Creek to make sure they are safe. So far, all 80 they've inspected haven't showed any problems.\n\n\"If we do find a mechanical situation that does require us to stop the chair, we're going to go through the proper procedures,\" Weimer said.\n\nWeimer emphasized the importance of safety procedures, which he said are reviewed daily.

Todd Christofferson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles reflected on the challenges that people face here in Africa — poverty, illness, natural disasters, crime or other difficulties — he said there often is an anxiousness to respond with ways to meet immediate needs for survival and well-being.\n\nBut the ultimate help, he explained, is spiritual.\n\n“The covenants of the gospel of Jesus Christ bring strength for all aspects of life, to deal with both the physical and the spiritual,” Elder Christofferson said. “I believe that the Saints here truly respond to what President Russell M. Nelson talks about often — the power of covenants.”\n\nHe said he has learned over his different visits to the continent, including this month’s ministry in the Africa South Area, that members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints expect miracles, and they receive them.\n\n“Covenants matter, and their promises to God are real. And they know that His promises to them are real. They know that He fulfills His promises,” Elder Christofferson said.\n\nElder Christofferson and his wife, Sister Kathy Christofferson, had meetings in South Africa, Madagascar, Angola and Mozambique. Elder S. Mark Palmer of the Presidency of the Seventy was with him in some of the meetings and countries as were members of the Africa South Area presidency: Elder Edward Dube, and his counselors, Elder Marcos A. Aidukaitis and Elder Denelson Silva, all General Authority Seventies.\n\nElder Christofferson has met with youth, missionaries, young adults, members and their friends while here. He was also interviewed by television journalists in Angola and Mozambique about his role, his hope for each country and what he had been learning from the people.\n\nEach time he comes, he said, it is a spiritually rewarding experience.\n\nMeeting young adults and missionaries in Johannesburg\n\nElder Christofferson began and ended his visit to the Africa South Area with meetings in Johannesburg — starting with a youth devotional on Saturday, May 18, and ending on Monday, May 27, with a visit to the Braam Institute of Religion building, which is also a YSA Gathering Place.\n\nThis building in the Braamfontein neighborhood hosts the Johannesburg YSA Branch on Sundays, family home evening groups on Mondays, various activities during the week and institute classes. It is a place where young single adults come from all around and can be with each other.\n\nThere Elder Christofferson shook hands with each young single adult after addressing them for a few minutes.\n\nVivienne Amoh said she learned to trust in the Lord’s promises. “The Apostles are real,” she said.\n\nIn between the meetings in Madagascar and Angola, Elder Christofferson was back in Johannesburg for a combined meeting of the South Africa Johannesburg Mission and South Africa Pretoria Mission on Wednesday, May 22.\n\nHe testified of the Book of Mormon and took questions from the missionaries about eternal life, gospel principles, teaching with reverence and raising families, telling them not to fear the future or have a sense of entitlement after their full-time missionary service has ended.\n\n“Great things are coming. Challenges, sure, everyone has those. But great things — great rewards, great happiness — great things are coming for your life,” he said.\n\nSister Christofferson also addressed the topic of challenges and days of discouragement: “Sometimes things can get tough, and you don’t see the fruits coming. When you are working hand in hand with the Lord, He does direct this work, and He is very mindful of you,” she said.\n\nIn speaking about the doctrine of Christ, Elder Dube said because of his Roman Catholic upbringing, he knew about Christ — which prepared him to receive the message of the restored gospel. “You will be able to teach into the heart when you center your teaching on the doctrine of Christ.”\n\nMissionaries taught and baptized Sister Dube, who told the missionaries to seek the Lord’s help and stay worthy. “When the going gets tough, just remember that you were called to do this work and that you are not alone. The Lord Himself is with you.”\n\nElder Lame Busang, from Botswana, said the first words Elder Christofferson spoke about were the very things he needed to hear. “When he said, ‘you should be here,’ that was an answer to the very question that I have had for the past few weeks.”\n\nElder Samukeniso Dlamini, from Newcastle, South Africa, said the Spirit was almost “overwhelming” as he felt a stronger testimony of his purpose as a missionary and how he can invite others to come unto Christ “so that we can do the work of the Lord.”\n\nTouring Tambo Hospital\n\nElder Christofferson witnessed some of the Church’s humanitarian efforts in the country through a visit to Tambo Memorial Hospital in the Boksburg neighborhood on May 26. The Church has offered support to the 118-year-old public institution with funding that has purchased life-saving technology and equipment for the most vulnerable babies in the area.\n\nThe hospital has had to make do with infrastructure challenges and pressing needs — but because of the Church’s support, more babies’ lives are being saved, including the tiniest of premature babies, some fitting into the palm of a hand.\n\nDuring a tour of one of the hospital wards, the Christoffersons, Palmers, Dubes and Silvas met a mother giving kangaroo care to her brand new baby. This is where a baby is tucked close to the mother’s chest for recovery, bonding and health benefits. The group also saw babies in incubators in a long, crowded ward on another floor, and viewed the pediatric area for older infants.\n\nDr. Londiwe Buthelezi observed the Church leaders and their wives listening to understand and exhibiting compassion. She told them, “I understand now why you do the things that you do. You cannot fake what I saw today.”\n\nElder Christofferson then shared that the Church would be making another substantial donation to the hospital. At this, the doctors and hospital staff became overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude.\n\nIn response, Elder Christofferson said how grateful the Church is for the staff’s devotion and sacrifice, because the Lord has taught that the worth of souls is great in His sight. Faithful members of the Church all over the world contribute offerings and strive to live the two great commandments — to love God and to love one’s neighbor.\n\nExplaining that like the ancient apostles, he too can bear witness of Jesus Christ, Elder Christofferson said he can see how the hospital staff tries to follow in His footsteps. “He is the living Savior, and in the end, He will make all things right.”",

      "# [Oliver Tambo by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2004-01-17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Tambo)\nSouth African anti-apartheid activist and politician (1917–1993)\n\n\"OR Tambo\" redirects here. For other uses, see OR Tambo (disambiguation).\n\nOliver Reginald Kaizana Tambo (27 October 1917 – 24 April 1993) was a South African anti-apartheid politician and activist who served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) from 1967 to 1991.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nChildhood\n\n[edit]\n\nOliver Tambo was born on 27 October 1917 in the village of Nkantolo in Bizana; eastern Pondoland in what is now the Eastern Cape. Most of the people in the village were farmers. His father, Mzimeni Tambo, was the son of a farmer and an assistant salesperson at a local trading store. Mzimeni had four wives and ten children, all of whom were literate. Oliver's mother, Mzimeni's third wife, was called Julia.\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nTambo graduated high school in 1938 as one of the top students. After this, Tambo was admitted to the University of Fort Hare but in 1940 he, along with several others including Nelson Mandela, was expelled for participating in a student strike. In 1942, Tambo returned to his former high school in Johannesburg to teach science and mathematics.\n\nYouth League\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1944, along with Nelson Mandela, and Walter Sisulu, Tambo founded the ANC Youth League, with Tambo becoming its first National Secretary and a member of the National Executive in 1948. The Youth League proposed a change in the tactics of the anti-apartheid movement. Previously, the ANC had sought to further its cause by actions such as petitions and demonstrations; the Youth League felt these actions were insufficient to achieve the group's goals and proposed their own \"Program of Action\". This program advocated tactics such as boycotts, civil disobedience, strikes, and non-collaboration.\n\nIn 1955, Tambo became Secretary-general of the ANC after Sisulu was banned by the South African government under the Suppression of Communism Act. In 1958, he became Deputy President of the ANC and in 1959 was served with a five-year banning order by the government.[citation needed]\n\nExile to London\n\n[edit]\n\nIn response, Tambo was sent abroad by the ANC to mobilize opposition to apartheid on 21 March 1960.[1] He settled with his family in Muswell Hill, north London, where he lived until 1990. His exile took a toll on him not seeing his wife and three children, but his wife Adelaide supported the ANC at home by taking in ANC members arriving from the UK.[2]\n\nIn 1967, Tambo became Acting President of the ANC, following the death of Chief Albert Luthuli. He sought to keep the ANC together even after he was exiled from South Africa. Due to his skillful lobbying, he was able to attract talented South African exiles, one of them being Thabo Mbeki.[citation needed]\n\nOn 30 December 1979 in Lusaka, Zambia, Tambo as president and Alfred Nzo, then secretary-general of the ANC, met Tim Jenkin, Stephen Lee and Alex Moumbaris, ANC members and escapees from incarceration at Phillip Kgosi Prison as political prisoners. Their presence was officially announced by the ANC in early January and Tambo introduced them at a press conference on 2 January 1980.[3]\n\nGuerrilla activity\n\n[edit]\n\nTambo was directly responsible for organizing active guerrilla units. Along with his comrades, among whom were Nelson Mandela, Joe Slovo, and Walter Sisulu, Tambo directed and facilitated several attacks against the South African public.[citation needed] In an interview in 1985, Tambo was quoted as saying: \"In the past, we were saying the ANC will not deliberately take innocent life, but now, looking at what is happening in South Africa, it is difficult to say civilians are not going to die.\"[4]\n\nThe post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) identified Tambo as the person who gave final approval, in between 1978 and 1979, for the 20 May 1983 Church Street bombing, which resulted in the death of 19 people and injuries to 197–217 people.[5][6] The attack was orchestrated by a special operations unit of the ANC's Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), commanded by Aboobaker Ismail. Such units had been authorized by Tambo as President of the ANC in 1979. At the time of the attack, they reported to Joe Slovo as chief of staff.\n\nThe ANC's submission said that the bombing was in response to a South African cross-border raid into Lesotho in December 1982 which killed 42 ANC supporters and civilians, and the assassination of Ruth First, an ANC activist and wife of Joe Slovo, in Maputo, Mozambique. It claimed that 11 of the casualties were SADF personnel and hence a military target. The legal representative of some of the victims argued that as they were administrative staff, including telephonists and typists, they could not be considered a legitimate military target.\n\nTen MK operatives, including Ismail, applied for amnesty for this and other bombings. The applications were opposed on various grounds, including that it was a terrorist attack disproportionate to the political motive. The TRC found that the number of civilians versus military personnel killed was unclear. South African Police statistics indicated that seven members of the SADF were killed. The commission found that at least 84 of the injured were SADF members or employees. Amnesty was granted by the TRC.[7]\n\nIn 1985, he was re-elected President of the ANC.[citation needed] In October of that year, Tambo gave an important interview to the editor of the Cape Times newspaper, Tony Heard, in which he outlined the ANC's position and vision for a future, non-racial, South Africa. The interview was important for helping to create the political conditions for the South African government to later openly enter talks with the ANC thereby resulting in the CODESA negotiations that would start upon his return to South Africa.[8][9][10]\n\nReturn to South Africa\n\n[edit]\n\nHe returned to South Africa on 13 December 1990 after over 30 years in exile.[11][12][13] He was able to return to South Africa because of the legalization of the ANC.[14] When he returned after his time in exile he received much support. Some of that support even came from old rivals.[15] However, because of his stroke in 1989, it was harder for him to fulfill his duties as President of the ANC, so in 1991, at the ANC's 48th National Conference, Nelson Mandela took over as president of the ANC. When he stepped down as president, however, the congress created a special position for him as the National Chairman.[16]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter suffering complications following a stroke, Tambo died on 24 April 1993, at the age of 75. His death came 14 days after Chris Hani's assassination and one year before the 1994 general election in which Nelson Mandela became President. Mandela, Thabo Mbeki, Walter Sisulu and other prominent politicians attended the funeral. Tambo was buried in Benoni, Gauteng.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nTambo was a devout Anglican.\n\nInternational relationships\n\n[edit]\n\nThe strong fight against apartheid brought Tambo to form a series of intense international relationships. In 1977, Tambo signed the first solidarity agreement between the ANC and a municipality: the Italian town of Reggio Emilia was the first city in the world to sign such a pact of solidarity.[14] This was the beginning of a long understanding which brought Italy to put an effort into concrete actions to support the right of southern African people's self-determination; one of these actions was the organization of solidarity ships. The first one, called \"Amanda\", departed from Genova in 1980.[17] It was Tambo himself who asked Reggio Emilia to mint Isitwalandwe Medals, the greatest of the ANC's honors.[18]\n\nHonours\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2004, he was voted number 31 in SABC3's Great South Africans,[citation needed] scoring lower than H. F. Verwoerd, before the SABC decided to cancel the final rounds of voting. The decision to cancel the results was largely informed by the fact that the majority of blacks South Africans did not participate in the voting, as SABC3 caters predominantly to English speakers.\n\nIn late 2005, ANC politicians announced plans to rename Johannesburg International Airport after him. Then-President Thabo Mbeki at this time did not side with this idea,[citation needed] and there was a behind closed door meeting deliberating on this. Votes were in favour of the idea and against Mbeki and the proposal was accepted and the renaming ceremony occurred on 27 October 2006. The ANC-dominated government had previously renamed Jan Smuts Airport as Johannesburg International Airport in 1994 on the grounds that South African airports should not be named after political figures.\n\nThere is a sculpture of Tambo at the Albert Road Recreation Ground, Muswell Hill, close to his London home. In February 2021, Haringey Council renamed the park as the O.R. Tambo Recreation Ground.[19] In June 2013, the city of Reggio Emilia in Italy celebrated Tambo with the creation of a park dedicated to the President of the African National Congress.\n\nHis house at 51 Alexandra Park Road, Muswell Hill, London, was purchased by the South African Government in 2010 as a historic monument and now bears a plaque.[20][21]\n\nTambo's grave was declared a National Heritage site when he died but lost this status when his wife, Adelaide Tambo, died and was buried alongside him. However their grave was re-declared a National Heritage site in October 2012.[22]\n\nThe ANC safe house in Lusaka, Zambia where Tambo spent much of his time in exile when not in London was declared a national monument by the Zambian Government in 2017, and opened to the public as Oliver Tambo Heritage House. It was opened by South African President Jacob Zuma, Zambian President Edgar Lungu and former Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda.[23]\n\nTo conclude the centenary celebrations of the birth of Tambo, a commemoration was held at Regina Mundi Catholic Church in Moroka, Soweto on 27 October 2017. This same event marked also the centenary of the sinking of the troopship SS Mendi. The event was curated by Ambassador Lindiwe Mabuza and Fr Lawrence Mduduzi Ndlovu, together with the Thabo Mbeki Foundation and the Oliver and Adelaide Tambo Foundation.[citation needed]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of people subject to banning orders under apartheid\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nANC biography\n\nSAHO biography\n\nAfrican National Congress\n\nOliver Tambo at britannica.com\n\nThe African Activist Archive Project website includes the audio of a January 1987 Reception Honoring ANC President Oliver R.
