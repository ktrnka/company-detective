When I ramp to Max, and 5C for momentary I get that brightness. If I 2C to max and then 5C I get memory momentary at a lower brightness. Is this because it's recognizing 2C as turbo and won't go into turbo momentary? (This also ties into my second question.) Is this because my turbo config is on option 1c instead of 2c in the 10H from on menu? \n\n\n\nSecond question:\nThe turbo configuration, 4th flash after 10H from on. \n\n. Can someone explain a few things to me; there are 3 options, 0C, 1C and 2C. \n\n0C says no turbo only ceiling; that would imply to me that there is a turbo level available beyond whatever you set your ceiling to but it's disabled. (But what if your ceiling is 150?) \n1C says ramp > 2C goes to full power (200% for dual channel lights.) I don't have dual channel so I'll omit that going forward.) \n2C says ramp> 2C goes to ceiling or full power if already at ceiling. \n \nThey second two options are a bit ambiguous, but to me it sounds like full power is considered higher than ceiling, and therefore if you are in option 1C, from anywhere in ramp 2C takes you to turbo. In option 2C, it sounds like from ramp, 2C takes you to ceiling first, then another 2C takes you to full power (turbo?)\n\nIs this correct?\n\nAnd lastly, if I set my ceiling to 150, does that mean that both option 1C and option 2C will behave the same, because 150 equals full power? \n\nI want turbo accessible, but I want it separate from Max, that way I don't enter it unnecessarily. If I need to lower my ceiling to have this ability, what number would be closest to \"high\" on a 5 level light with moon low medium high and turbo? Secondly, which turbo option do I pick, and do either of them change  the 2h from off or 3H from on function? \n\nSecond lastly, lol, is there a way to make turbo only accessible from 2H from off or 3H from on? Where 2c or ramp up will always only go as high as ceiling but you can access a brighter level with 2H off or 3H on?\n\n## Comment ID k95xdn2 with +3 score by [(SiteRelEnby, Reddit, 2023-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/17upzm1/some_anduril_2_questions_related_to_specific/k95xdn2/) (in reply to ID 17upzm1):\n>First unexpected behavior: My ceiling is set to 150.

This is a bug that has been [recently fixed](https://github.com/ToyKeeper/anduril/pull/16), although there isn't an official release with it yet, if you want I can build you a hex with it though.\n\n>(But what if your ceiling is 150?) \n\nThen it goes to 150\n\n>They second two options are a bit ambiguous, but to me it sounds like full power is considered higher than ceiling\n\nYes, full power is level 150.\n\nThis means:\n\n* 1C entered: If you are ramped to a level below your ceiling, 2C will take you to ceiling. If you already ramped all the way up, 2C will take you to full power (level 150).\n* 2C entered: 2C will always take you to full power (150/150), ceiling setting will be ignored (i.e. making ceiling only a ceiling for ramping)\n\n>And lastly, if I set my ceiling to 150, does that mean that both option 1C and option 2C will behave the same, because 150 equals full power? \n\nYes\n\n>I want turbo accessible, but I want it separate from Max, that way I don't enter it unnecessarily. If I need to lower my ceiling to have this ability, what number would be closest to \"high\" on a 5 level light with moon low medium high and turbo?\n\n130 is a common choice as well as default on quite a lot of lights, on many (not all) linear+FET lights it also represents maximum regulated (linear-only, no FET) power.\n\n>Second lastly, lol, is there a way to make turbo only accessible from 2H from off or 3H from on?

I also ended up lowering my ceiling to test what I was asking and adjusting turbo to the 2c option. \n\nThe only question I had that I felt your answer missed, was my comment about what if my ceiling is set to 150. Yes, I know that means my ceiling is 150, lol, but I think what I was getting at was, if I had the turbo set to 0C, with no turbo, but my ceiling was 150, wouldnt that cancel out the option and leave me with the turbo output, (but I would only be able to ramp up to it and I'm not sure how 2H from off would act.)\n\nAnd I thought of one other question; I'm in NYC and it's fairly bright a lot of the time so the default floor/moon is too low for me in most cases. I bumped up floor to around 30 so that in lockout the momentary floor is useful as well as the 1H to go into floor. If you raise the floor, is there any way to still access the lowest moon setting? In simple ui I see that the momentary options are moon and momentary and in advanced they are floor and momentary. Does that mean switching into simple UI and entering lockout is only way to get to absolute lowest moon without resetting it?\n\n\nAnd I don't necessarily need to program a special mode for turbo, when I want it easily accessible I turn momentary on. Like when I ride a bike through Manhattan I have the light on my neck it clipped to my jacket and I use the momentary mode like a horn, a blinker or to lookout for gigantic potholes. \n\nThanks again.\n\n#### Comment ID k9b90po with +1 score by [(SiteRelEnby, Reddit, 2023-11-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/17upzm1/some_anduril_2_questions_related_to_specific/k9b90po/) (in reply to ID k96673f):\n>  if I had the turbo set to 0C, with no turbo, but my ceiling was 150, wouldnt that cancel out the option and leave me with the turbo output, (but I would only be able to ramp up to it and I'm not sure how 2H from off would act.)\n\nYes, then you would get level 150 with 2C anyway.\n\n> If you raise the floor, is there any way to still access the lowest moon setting?\n\nYes. Set the floor to the lower level on the *other* ramp shape that you don't normally use (i.e. for the stepped ramp if you normally use smooth) then switch back to your normal ramp and set the floor to the higher level. Now 1H while locked will access the lower level of the two floors. If you have a manual memory level set, 2H will use this level, otherwise it will use the higher of the two floors.\n\nhttp://toykeeper.net/torches/fsm/anduril2/anduril-manual.txt\n\n>And I don't necessarily need to program a special mode for turbo, when I want it easily accessible I turn momentary on.

The appearance of Boromir's horn in the movies being similar to a real life horn may be coincidence, but it's also just as likely to be an inspiration.\n\nAs for Andúril and Durandal being similarly named, it's very likely that Tolkien drew upon any number of mythical blades when creating the story behind any of the blades in his stories, but the names are almost entirely constructed using his languages.

The *palantíri* do let you see things from afar, as the name literally means, and Palantir the company does focus on data analytics to at least theoretically get a good picture of what's happening on the ground. Also by the Third Age, *palantíri* are strongly associated with villains doing villlanous spying on the noble realms of men, even if they weren't originally created that way. There's a certain self-deprecating humour in a company called Palantir working on controversial police/intelligence projects, and I can respect that.\n\nBut *andúril* has none of that subtlety. You unironically went for the hero's sword named \"Flame of the West?\" It's just pure cringe.\n\n#### Comment ID jtzivgb with +2 score by [(throwdemawaaay, Reddit, 2023-07-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LessCredibleDefence/comments/15alj03/thoughts_on_anduril_industries/jtzivgb/) (in reply to ID jtlpxus):\nYeah, all associated with Peter Thiel who apparently is a Tolkein fan. Thiel is part of the \"Paypal Mafia,\" a group of 4 people that became powerful and influential VCs after the Paypal purchase by Ebay. Elon is also part of this group and it's well known they despise each other.\n\nElon's current antics with rebranding Twitter to X actually are part of all this. Back in the Paypal days Elon wanted the brand to be X instead. The founders got into a fight and Elon was pushed out by Thiel's faction.\n\nPalantir has a lot of government contracts. They hype their technology but the reality is it's just a vehicle for selling customization services. The platform itself is kind of like a mash up of Tablue and Google Maps. Thiel hires bright eyed interns from the top tech schools then has them code up whatever the heck the customer will pay for. As a result the company and platform don't have the greatest reputation in the private sector, where most of the high profile projects announced were quietly discontinued a year or two later. But apparently the platform is useful to enough people to keep the company making money.\n\n## Comment ID jtly2t4 with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LessCredibleDefence/comments/15alj03/thoughts_on_anduril_industries/jtly2t4/) (in reply to ID 15alj03):\ngood scamming and grifting\n\n## Comment ID jtluyj9 with +5 score by [(Pale-Dot-3868, Reddit, 2023-07-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LessCredibleDefence/comments/15alj03/thoughts_on_anduril_industries/jtluyj9/) (in reply to ID 15alj03):\nIt’s business model is interesting because it does defense contracting in a fast-speed, tech startup fashion, especially in a defense industry that’s slow. It’s niche is in autonomous systems, which is rapidly gaining traction in warfare. It already has a suite of autonomous products, ranging from a UAVs to its Lattice OS. It’s systems are already being deployed in conflicts, such as the Sentry tower in the US-Mexico border and I think the Altius-600 was sent to Ukraine. It’s also diversifying since I think it bought a rocket engine company. Overall, I think they will definitely have a prosperous future in providing the US with small, autonomous systems and networking operating systems, but it will still face lots of competition from the defense giants and other companies who make autonomous systems unless it begins to diversify more.\n\n## Comment ID jtlufv7 with +1 score by [(saucerwizard, Reddit, 2023-07-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LessCredibleDefence/comments/15alj03/thoughts_on_anduril_industries/jtlufv7/) (in reply to ID 15alj03):\nI think its nerd trash tbh. omg peter thiel1!1!1!",

Besides my general hesitancy around working for the military industrial complex, if you want to go in that direction, Lockheed Martin is certainly friendlier to employee diversity than Palmer Luckey has very, very vocally been. Are Luckey's views on trans people, queer people, muslims, et cetera consistent with what the workplace is like?\n\n\nBeyond that, are ACM and IEEE ethics guidelines considered within the software and hardware teams? Autonomous weapons are an understandably controversial point of R&D, especially when, from my understanding, Anduril is willing to sell directly to Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and several other violators of international law and human rights, provided they are American allies. \n\nIn that vein, is there any freedom for employees to refuse to work directly on weapons teams? I don't mean to come across as combative, but Anduril and Luckey are very visible in the startup space for plenty of interesting and plenty of concerning reasons, which I think should be addressed to the same degree as the technical aspects of these roles. \n\nNonetheless, I don't really expect I'm going to see a response to any of this. So my only advice to other software engineers excited about more functional roles is to make sure you read into Palmer and Anduril closely ahead of applying, especially if you're coming from a community that might be particularly unwelcome according to Palmer.\n\n\nedit: the discomfort with my criticisms is disappointing, but not totally unexpected. at least Rust, Julia, and APL remain very accepting communities! and Haskell's leadership is great, too.\n\n### Comment ID lyp573a with +2 score by [(xedrac, Reddit, 2024-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1gkek8a/anduril_industries_is_hiring_summer_2025_haskell/lyp573a/) (in reply to ID lvsf0v9):\nI don't work for Anduril directly, but I've been to their HQ a few times and have done some contract work for them.  I've seen a few of their posts on here, and they often get a lot of hate, and I don't understand it.  So as someone that isn't beholden to them, let me give my perspective.  They have one of the best cultures I've seen in any company I've done work for.  I attribute that partially to Palmer and his unorthodox take on running a business and his larger-than-life attitude.  On campus you'll see one of the most diverse set of employees anywhere.  The level of competence is also very high.  I would have loved to have an internship opportunity like this when I was a budding engineer.  Sure you could go intern at Lockheed, and do your little pigeon-holed task where you are nothing more than an E1 resource label on some bean counter's spreadsheet, working on some crusty old project that has so many rules surrounding it you can't really do anything.  Or you could work on some incredibly interesting projects with a lot of really smart people around you, who all are very productive and willing to teach you what they know.  Your opportunity for growth is excellent.  There are a couple downsides though.  You might get fat because they feed you really good food every day for breakfast and lunch, and they have snacks everywhere you look.  Some of the people work very strange hours.  The flexibility is obviously very nice, but sometimes it can make it hard to coordinate with others in a timely manner.  Lastly, Anduril might raise your expectations unnecessarily high for what jobs are supposed to be like.  It will likely spoil you for all of your future jobs.  I don't say that jokingly.  Anduril really is quite special in this regard.\n\n### Comment ID lvya83p with +5 score by [(palmerluckey, Reddit, 2024-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1gkek8a/anduril_industries_is_hiring_summer_2025_haskell/lvya83p/) (in reply to ID lvsf0v9):\n*\"Lockheed Martin is certainly friendlier to employee diversity than Palmer Luckey has very, very vocally been.\"*\n\nSounds like you are just making things up.\n\n*\"is there any freedom for employees to refuse to work directly on weapons teams?\"*\n\nAnduril is a weapons company.\n\n*\"especially if you're coming from a community that might be particularly unwelcome according to Palmer\"*\n\nYou are so full of shit.\n\n#### Comment ID lvyklmn with +1 score by [(Instrume, Reddit, 2024-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1gkek8a/anduril_industries_is_hiring_summer_2025_haskell/lvyklmn/) (in reply to ID lvya83p):\n>*\"especially if you're coming from a community that might be particularly unwelcome according to Palmer\"*\n\n>You are so full of shit.\n\nSo, you're confirming that Anduril employs LGBTQIA people provided that they fit into the company culture and legally can be employed on your clearance projects?

Anduril and Luckey's particular rejection of such employees (if they are in fact in agreement) is worth me at least mentioning- I certainly wasn't disallowing people from applying to the position (honestly, I might apply anyways- I believe my security clearance is still valid). \n\nI stand by the questions being fair to ask and criticism of Anduril (even under one of their own job postings) being allowable. I also am not sure that a given defense company rejecting marginalized communities under the impression they have innately unamerican sympathies would go over well in court, though I have no reason to think Anduril is as serious a discriminator as that- I'm just referring to your point about like-minded employees. \n\nReally my concern with Anduril is mostly with Palmer, which is why I keep comparing Lockheed Martin to them. I also think Anduril goes a little bit under the radar in terms of his antics than, for instance, Musk and SpaceX, while dealing with a more serious and important to regulate industry. So I think letting people know to look into it is more than fair. Who knows, maybe I'm making the recruiters job easier too if it means they're getting less applications from either anti imperialists, gays, or russian spies.

I love flashlights. I love users having the most possible control over their hardware. I love open source. And Toykeeper is an absolute boss.\n\nAll that said...\n\nThis chart is a nightmare in terms of making the necessary information available and easy to understand, and I've watched it expand over the last few years, it's only getting worse. The tables linked in here are better, but it's still not great.\n\nAt a certain point, demanding that all functionality, no matter how complex or numerous, be addressed by just button clicks stops being the best way to do things when there are viable alternatives. \n\nAny flashlight that has a USB port should allow writing configs to the flashlight and skipping all the button pressing. \n\nAny flashlight that can be set by button clicking can have an adapter for hooking into the on / off circuit that would allow updating all these options without the manual labor.\n\nBluetooth and wifi chips with antennas built in are getting smaller every year and integrating one or the other going forward is a better alternative for manufacturers serving enthusiasts.\n\nAnd to preempt any \"So do it yourself!\" or \"How many PCBs have you designed?\" nonsense replies, you don't have to be a chef to know when the food you're eating isn't great. \n\nManufacturers want to give you what you want. If you start asking for a better interface than button clicks, and there's enough like-minded folks, it will happen.

I think they'd be worthless anyways but I guess they are there if you want them. \n\nI'm just glad all of the \"core\" functionality is still easy to use. I've found Anduril 2 to be really great to use and easy to configure. These charts are easy to follow and it was nice to be able to change a few things around to make the light output for how I typically use it.

People say it is too complicated but rather I think it is like being able to make your torch function the way you want to without thinking \"I wish my light can do this\", because with Anduril, you have less opportunity cost options to deal with.\n\nI think really the main point of Anduril is its \"set and forget\" feature. It has a lot of options, but it doesn't mean you need to click it a lot of times every time. Once you set it up the way you like, it is good to go and you don't have to switch to set modes too.\n\nAlso, you can download the eeprom as well, meaning you can save your options settings and potentially transfer it to other Anduril lights with the same features and firmware build.\n\n## Comment ID kb3j1xn with +2 score by [(Geromegoons, Reddit, 2023-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kb3j1xn/) (in reply to ID 185cxre):\nRidiculous.\n\nI enjoy tinkering and nerding out over things like torches but when I see this my honest reaction is \"I'm not reading that\".\n\nIs there not a way we just plug the torch in to a USB port on a PC and config it with a small program?

The few lead tech positions available have been filled by relatively inexperienced employees with with less than a year of experience, so very poor managerial choices in regard to who gets promoted. On that note, tech leadership positions are just appointments, they don't hold interviews for anyone else who may be qualified or interested. Management doesn't really seem to have much interest in developing their employees professionally. Annual review structure is disorganized at best and raises are very small (less than 2% raise each year even with a stellar review). Have to work 3-4 hours of overtime every day to even make a decent living to survive. All funding is essentially saved for the army of software engineers they hire and fire every quarter. On a weekly basis I have one or another newly graduated engineer attempt to tell me how to do my job (with over a decade of tech experience). The last several years have been nothing short of an extremely frustrating experience and huge letdown from what was promised when I quit my previous job and came here. Had I known what I do now, I would've never wasted my time applying.",

You can expand your hiring to be more diverse, but without a culture that feels safe and inclusive, you won't be able to keep them.

And PM/TPM means something different on every team. \nThe products don't actually work. What we're selling doesn't match what we actually have built.\nTesting is a nice-to-have, which won't scale for large UAVs.\n\nA good chunk of these positive reviews come from an all-hands where poor interview practices/feedback was brought up and the solution was telling employees to flood Glassdoor with positive reviews vs fixing practices.",

Management doesn't really seem to have much interest in developing their employees professionally.

Have to work 3-4 hours of overtime every day to even make a decent living to survive. All funding is essentially saved for the army of software engineers they hire and fire every quarter.

Together, Anduril and Apex aim to set a new standard for quality, scale, and capability that can be delivered to customers to responsively meet their needs.\n\nThe agreement combines Apex's capabilities as an innovative spacecraft bus manufacturer with Anduril's AI-powered payloads and systems integration expertise. As part of this agreement, Anduril will utilize its capabilities as a mission systems integrator to field operational systems by bringing together technology across the industrial base. Anduril will also contribute its own products from on-orbit edge processing, versatile payloads, ground C2 systems, and other autonomous operations support that is essential to field mission-ready satellite constellations.\n\nAs a merchant supplier of satellite buses, Apex will provide its off the shelf spacecraft designed for mass manufacturing. These productized buses offer Anduril the scale, quality, and reliability it needs to advance their missions in space. Satellite buses provide necessary components for any spacecraft, allowing systems to maneuver, communicate, provide power, and more. Apex's productized satellite buses are unique in their rapid manufacturability, allowing the company to deliver high-quality spacecraft in quantity at a pace necessary to meet critical mission needs.\n\nEarlier this year, Anduril and Apex successfully launched their first joint mission, Aries SN1, with Anduril's edge-processing payload. Pictured above is a photo taken by SN-1 sensors and processed by Anduril's edge-payload, all tasked through Anduril's Lattice platform. From initial concept to flight-ready delivery, this entire project was completed in just 2 months - an unprecedented speed - demonstrating the value of Anduril and Apex's product-led approach that prioritizes interoperable components and productized off the shelf spacecraft, which can be rapidly integrated and customized for mission needs.\n\nIn 2025, Anduril will launch its own self-funded mission, powered by Apex's Aries bus, featuring upgraded mission data processing and new infrared imaging capabilities, marking the next phase of their collaboration. This next mission will serve as an essential tech maturation demo, and it will be the foundation for Anduril and Apex's commitment to regularly deploying more mass to orbit.\n\n\"We're proud to partner with Apex to put our software-defined, hardware-enabled capabilities in space,\" said Gokul Subramanian, Anduril's SVP of Space and Engineering. \"Apex's productized, off-the-shelf, approach to bus development offers the high quality and reliability Anduril needs for our IRAD mission as well as their ability to manufacture at scale to meet future demand.\"\n\n\"Apex and Anduril are aligned in our approach to getting decisive capabilities into the hands of the warfighter at the necessary scale and speed,\" said Ian Cinnamon, Apex Founder and CEO. \"Anduril was founded on the belief that the exquisite, bespoke approach to defense capabilities will not keep pace with threats from China and Russia. Apex takes that same approach in space, providing productized capabilities to help our customers get on orbit as fast as possible. Together, Anduril and Apex can meet the Pentagon's goal of rapidly proliferating capabilities in space.\"\n\nThis partnership follows significant milestones for both companies, including Apex's $95M Series B round, Anduril's $1.5B Series F round, and the announcement of Anduril's Arsenal-1 manufacturing facility.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nApex\n\nClaude Chafin\n\n[email protected]\n\nAnduril\n\nSofia Haft\n\n[email protected]\n\nSOURCE Apex Space",

Check out The Crunchbase Megadeals Board.\n\nThis is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.\n\nThe week saw the second-biggest raise of the year, as Anduril Industries’ monster raise ranks behind only xAI’s massive $6 billion in May. Aside from that, the week saw some big rounds from cybersecurity, travel and of course, biotech.\n\n1. Anduril Industries, $1.5B, defense: Anduril Industries matched its own record for the largest defense tech round ever. The Costa Mesa, California-based startup locked up a $1.5 billion Series F that values the company at $14 billion — a 69% jump from the $8.5 billion valuation it received after its massive $1.5 billion Series E in late 2022. The round was co-led by Founders Fund and Sands Capital. The company will use some of the new proceeds for the development of Arsenal-1 — a more than 5 million-square-foot production space designed to produce tens of thousands of autonomous military systems annually. After a slow start to the year, funding to defense tech startups has picked up dramatically in the past few months. Just last month, Helsing, which develops artificial intelligence software for defense, raised approximately $489 million in funding led by General Catalyst that values the company at $5.4 billion. After Anduril’s huge round, defense tech startups now have raised $2.5 billion in 2024, per Crunchbase data. Last year, such startups collected only $2 billion total.\n\n2. Groq, $640M, semiconductor: AI semiconductor and software startup Groq started the week off with a bang when it announced it had locked up a $640 million Series D round at a valuation of $2.8 billion. The round was led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. The Mountain View, California-based firm is helping develop ways to optimize AI and lessen the vast amount of computing power that is currently needed to do that. The new round almost triples the company’s valuation from its Series C in 2021. Founded in 2016, the company has raised $1 billion, per Crunchbase.\n\n3. Abnormal Security, $250M, cybersecurity: Abnormal Security closed a $250 million Series D that now values the San Francisco-based cybersecurity startup at $5.1 billion. The new round was led by Wellington Management. The new valuation is a more than 28% uptick from the $4 billion valuation Abnormal got when it raised a $210 million Series C led by Insight Partners back in May 2022. Founded in 2018, Abnormal looks to stop attacks and find compromised accounts across email and connected applications through leveraging machine learning and AI to understand human behavior. The startup has raised nearly $546 million total, per the company. Abnormal also says it recently surpassed $200 million in annual recurring revenue. After a down 2023, cybersecurity startups are once again seeing the cash. In the second quarter of 2024, cyber startups saw a robust $4.4 billion invested, according to Crunchbase data. The dollar figure represents a 63% increase from Q1, which saw $2.7 billion roll to startups in 173 deals. It was the best quarter for funding in the sector since Q1 2022 and a 144% increase from Q2 2023.\n\n4. Flyr, $225M, travel: Travel startup Flyr raised $225 million in equity and $70 million in debt in a new funding round. The equity portion was led by WestCap and reportedly values the startup at $900 million. The San Francisco-based startup develops software for the travel industry, such as airlines. Founded in 2013, the company has raised $482 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n5. IDRx, $120M, biotech: The big biotech raise this week went to a Plymouth, Massachusetts-based startup. IDRx, a clinical-stage biotech developing cancer treatment with precision therapies, raised a $120 million Series B led by Commodore Capital, RA Capital Management and Blackstone multiasset investing. Founded in 2022, the company has raised $242 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n6. DevRev, $100M, artificial intelligence: Palo Alto, California-based DevRev, which develops AI for customer support and other uses, raised $100 million from Khosla Ventures and other investors. The round reportedly values the company at $1.15 billion. Founded in 2020, the company has raised $150 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n7. Shinobi Therapeutics, $68M, biotech: Shinobi Therapeutics, a South San Francisco, California-based biotechnology company developing immune evasive iPS cell therapies, raised a $68 million Series A extension from Mitsubishi UFJ Capital and Yosemite. Founded in 2023, Shinobi says it has raised $119 million.\n\n8. MBX Biosciences, $64M, biotech: MBX Biosciences, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of precision peptide therapies for the treatment of metabolic disorders, announced a $63.5 million Series C financing led by Deep Track Capital. Founded in 2019, the Carmel, Indiana-based company has raised more than $238 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n9. Muon Space, $57M, space: Mountain View, California-based Muon Space, which designs and operates low-earth orbit satellite constellations, raised a $56.7 million Series B funding led by Activate Capital. Founded in 2021, the company has raised nearly $92 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n10. Red Queen Therapeutics, $55M, biotech: Red Queen Therapeutics came out of stealth with a $55 million Series A from Apple Tree Partners. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company develops antiviral treatments.\n\nBig global deals\n\nWhile the biggest raises came from the U.S., there was a large AI round in Asia.\n\nChina-based artificial intelligence startup Moonshot AI raised a $300 million venture round.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of August 3 to August 9. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.",

      "# [Anduril wins $100M deal from CDAO to scale ‘edge data mesh’ capabilities by Jon Harper on 2024-12-03](https://defensescoop.com/2024/12/03/anduril-awarded-100m-deal-cdao-scale-edge-data-mesh-capabilities-ota/)\nThe Pentagon’s Chief Digital and AI Office has awarded Anduril a $100 million other transaction agreement to scale its “edge data integration services capabilities” for the U.S. military, the Defense Department announced Tuesday in its daily list of major contract awards.\n\nThe work on the three-year production deal is estimated to be completed by November 2028. The production OTA was previously competed as a prototype other transaction, according to the DOD.\n\n“The mesh is already operational across multiple services and combatant commands, delivering critical data that enables mission-relevant generative artificial intelligence (AI) solutions specifically tailored to the unique requirements of the warfighter. This agreement will accelerate the expansion of the mesh to increase access to decentralized, distributed and disconnected systems, and to power new insights and real-time decision making at the edge,” Anduril said in a press release.\n\nAny U.S. military service or combatant command can leverage the new production OTA, according to the company.\n\nThe award comes as the Pentagon is pursuing an initiative known as Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2), which aims to more effectively and efficiently connect the sensors, shooters and data streams of the U.S. military services and key allies. The CDAO is working to enable that warfighting construct with artificial intelligence capabilities and other digital tools.\n\nAnduril’s “tactical Edge Data Mesh” offering is enabled by the firm’s Lattice Mesh software platform, which can connect with and operate on a variety of sensors, weapons, platforms and other systems, according to the contractor.\n\nThe firm describes the tool as a “decentralized networking capability that seamlessly distributes critical data across platforms, domains, and partners by intelligently prioritizing data paths to ensure the most efficient flow of critical data.”\n\nOther DOD components have awarded contracts to Anduril for Lattice-related capabilities recently. Just last month, the company announced that the Space Force’s acquisition arm had awarded the organization a nearly $100 million contract to upgrade the service’s Space Surveillance Network (SSN) with Lattice software to enhance autonomous processing and distribution of data from a vast network of military space sensors.\n\nThe deal with the CDAO announced Tuesday comes as the Defense Department is pursuing next-generation drones and counter-drone technologies via initiatives like Replicator.\n\nAnduril is touting Lattice as an enabler of “autonomous battle networks.”\n\n“Warfighters at the edge will be enabled to publish and subscribe to data in support of time sensitive operations or where large numbers of manned, unmanned and autonomous systems must collaborate in contested environments to advance the mission,” according to Anduril’s press release. “The extensibility of this [Lattice] system allows Anduril and CDAO to add integrations to support command and control of autonomous systems and counter-autonomous systems.”",
