      "# [Lattice SDK core concepts](https://docs.anduril.com/guide/concepts)\nThis page covers core concepts and use cases for building with the Lattice SDK™.\n\nSince its founding, Anduril has excelled in building integrated systems that function reliably in austere and even hostile environments. Anduril's first Sentry Towers performed key workloads such as computer vision and sensor fusion locally at the edge in order to automatically triage suspected threats from the environment, independent of a human operator. As we introduced new products such as Anvil, we continued to push processing and collaboration to the edge, rather than centralize logic on data center servers.\n\nThis local-first DNA is embodied in all of Anduril's products, and the networking and autonomy technologies which Anduril has built to achieve integration and collaboration among these local-first products form the backbone of Anduril’s differentiated capability. We call this backbone Lattice, and this SDK is meant to help accelerate your ability to quickly build decentralized applications that can deploy and interoperate with other systems on the mesh.\n\nAs you build your solution, we recommend adopting the following core principles to ensure your application can operate successfully on the mesh:\n\nLocal-First Design - A network connection can not be assumed to be constant nor abundant. In order to deliver applications that perform well in a degradable mesh network environment, developers should be highly responsible with bandwidth utilization and build in the assumption that the network may be spotty or fail on a regular basis. For the best experience, we recommend designing with network failure in mind.\n\nData Exchange through Open Data Models - In order for our systems to interoperate they must speak the same language. Anduril has standardized key data models which are utilized across all of Anduril's products and applications.\n\nWe believe embracing these two simple principles allow our teams to move quickly and independently, without sacrificing our ability to deliver integrated solutions. This approach fosters interoperability without requiring high levels of prior coordination. As long as teams adhere to standard data models and build systems that can work in local, disconnected environments, bringing them together can be a simple process.\n\nWe believe in this model so strongly that we’re publishing this framework as the Lattice SDK which supports developers in building decentralized and interoperable solutions.\n\nWith the Lattice SDK and its open data models, Anduril allows every bespoke data system and hardware platform to become general purpose to the extent it integrates with a large and growing set of networked, data-centric applications and physical systems at the tactical edge.\n\nThe Lattice SDK documents and implements two foundational structured data models:\n\nAn entity is the representation of anything in the world that is significant as an aspect of situational awareness. Examples of entities include assets clearly emitting their well known location such as aircraft or ground vehicles as well as estimated positions of radio emitters. For more information, see Entities overview.\n\nA task models a command to a networked actor to perform some useful action. Actors are as diverse as robotic vehicles, electronic sensor systems, and manned platforms. Tasks may command effects-oriented actions, provide sensing priorities, trigger configuration changes, and more.\n\nBy implementing both a local-first architecture and specific data models such as entity and task, developers are able to quickly deliver new, innovative value alongside complementary and synergistic solutions in a common data mesh.",

      "# [Build with Lattice](https://docs.anduril.com/entity/overview)\nThis overview describes entities, the entity data model's components, and how Entity Manager supports distributed entity management.\n\nAn entity is an interoperable data structure that powers a common operational picture (COP). A COP provides human and machine consumers with a shared view of the current state of the modeled world, which enhances situational awareness and facilitates decision-making.\n\nEntities represent any type of known object that can be referenced or commanded.\n\nEntities can be tangible or intangible, including:\n\nPhysical objects, such as vessels or drones.\n\nNon-physical objects, such as signal detections.\n\nVisual concepts, such as bounding boxes or control zones.\n\nAlthough there is no strict type hierarchy, a user interface could group entities according to its ontology.template component. The three top-level groupings are track, asset, and geo-entity.\n\nTracks: any contact not directly under the control of friendly forces. This can include aircraft tracks generated from radar or sensor hits, signal detections, vehicles or people detected through cameras, or any other contact source.\n\nTracks include all entities with the following template types:\n\nTrack: An object detection.\n\nSensor point of interest: A sensor detection at a specific location.\n\nSignal of interest: A signal detection with characteristics such as emitter notation, frequency, or lines of bearing.\n\nExamples include:\n\nAn aircraft reporting its information using an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) transponder.\n\nA surface vessel reporting its information using an Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponder.\n\nA person detected by computer vision processing of camera images from a tower.\n\nA signal detection with an estimated area and error ellipse.\n\nAssets: entities directly under your control that generally can accept tasks from the operator. Examples include Anduril towers, Dive, and so on.\n\nGeo-entities: shapes or points of interest drawn on the map. They might not physically exist in the world. A geo-entity could be a point representing an airfield or a control zone meant to constrain operations of an autonomous vehicle. Examples include:\n\nA point of interest on the map manually created by one operator to share with other operators.\n\nA zone around a training area.\n\nA keep-out-zone on the map indicating an area where a hurricane develops.\n\nThe entity data model is the canonical data model that represents all objects in the COP. It represents the known state of the world in Lattice, providing a common language to describe any object or concept that can enhance an operator's situational awareness.\n\nThe entity data model consists of different fields called components.\n\nThe entity data model observes these principles:\n\nComponents are optional, except those listed in Customize entities.\n\nComponents mustn't be duplicative. Avoid modeling the same underlying data on two different components.\n\nComponents are non-hierarchical. The data model is composable and not an inheritance tree.\n\nFor the full list of possible entity components, refer to the canonical entity data model.\n\nThe data model is based on the entity component system architecture and favors composition over inheritance. The presence or absence of components—rather than a strict type hierarchy—determines what an entity is or how it should be interacted with. Think of an entity as a bag of components that can be mixed and matched as needed.\n\nEntity consumers key off specific components to decide how to process the entity. When producing an entity, only include components that are relevant to the entity you're modeling, along with the required components.\n\nFor example, to model a track you should include:\n\nA location to render the track on the map.\n\nAn ontology to specify which icon type to render in Lattice UI.\n\nA sensors component if the track has sensors. Downstream consumers that perform actions on sensors will behave correctly based on the presence of this component in your entity.\n\nBecause an entity is a collection of components, entities can sometimes be in incomplete states. An incomplete state means the entity is missing some expected components or values. This is a reasonable condition for situational awareness data in a COP, which is an aggregation of real-time, known data.\n\nIn some cases, the producers pushing data may not have the full picture yet. There's still value in distributing this partial state for situational awareness purposes. Therefore, it's important for services consuming entities to be robust against missing components.\n\nEntity Manager is the backend Lattice service that powers the COP. Once an entity is available in the COP, operators can use it for other Lattice services, such as tasking or creating alerts.\n\nEntity Manager provides a real-time, distributed COP:\n\nReal-time: Entity Manager provides the current state of the COP by publishing entity events that follow the entity lifecycle of create, update, or delete. Entity Manager doesn't provide historical data.\n\nDistributed: A layer on top of Lattice's mesh network, Entity Manager supports distributed entity management. Entity Manager instances in a mesh network can send entities to or receive entities from another Entity Manager instance in the mesh. The COP eventually becomes consistent between nodes, which store files, entities, and tasks in the Lattice system; each COP's view converges, subject to operator controls.\n\nEntities have a well-defined lifecycle of create, update, and delete. On each lifecycle state change, Entity Manager emits the state change event to the COP using the StreamEntityComponents call (gRPC | HTTP).\n\nCreate: When an entity first appears or re-appears after expiring, the entity is created.\n\nUpdate: When data in the entity changes, Entity Manager emits the state change as an update event. Note that, for performance reasons, Entity Manager relies on changes to the provenance.source_update_time to trigger an update event. It does not perform a full proto diff to the provenance.source_update_time component to trigger an update event.\n\nDelete: An entity is deleted when its expiry_time has passed or an update is sent with the is_live component set to false. You should handle a delete event by removing all references to it in memory or discarding it from your user interface.\n\nOn each lifecycle state change, the Entities API emits state change events via StreamEntityComponents (gRPC | HTTP).\n\nIt's the integration's responsibility to control an entity's lifecycle by sending updates and setting expiry times as needed.\n\nIn the Lattice ecosystem, integrations produce entities, achieved by publishing pre-populated entity objects to Lattice using the Entity Manager service gRPCs or HTTP SDKs.\n\nThe Entity Manager API provides the PublishEntity RPC to create or update entities. When beginning to integrate with Lattice, we recommend using this unary RPC because it provides validates its input and provides an immediate error response if the entity is malformed. It is also capable of high throughput. Exact numbers will vary greatly depending on the Lattice hardware you are integrating with.\n\nIf waiting for a unary response causes your publish task to fall behind, we also offer the PublishEntities gRPC client-streaming API to publish entities to Lattice. There are some tradeoffs to consider when deciding to use the client-streaming RPC:\n\nYou can achieve higher throughput because your publish task does not need to wait for a response from the server.\n\nYou may lose data if your stream connection with the server is terminated early. In most gRPC streaming implementations, outgoing messages are buffered locally prior to being sent over the wire. If the connection is terminated then all buffered messages are lost.\n\nYou will receive no feedback from the server regarding validity of the entity messages you publish.\n\nIntegrations can also consume entities from Lattice by streaming the COP from the Entity Manager API through the StreamEntityComponents endpoints (gRPC | HTTP).\n\nIn Lattice Mesh, the Lattice SDK can distribute entities between different Lattice nodes. Integrations only need to publish entities to their local Lattice node; Lattice Mesh takes care of sharing those entities with other Lattice nodes in the mesh network.\n\nLattice administrators have fine-grained control over this distribution. They can choose which Lattice nodes to distribute entities to by applying filters on a select majority of components in the entity data model.\n\nCertain fields on the entity data model are annotated as overridable. Overrides enable a user or system to change the value of a component on an entity that exists in the COP. The user or system that creates the override doesn't have to be the original producer of the entity.\n\nOverrides are distributed; an override created on one Lattice node will be visible on other Lattice nodes on the mesh.\n\nOperators or services generally use overrides when they have new or different information about an entity. For example, an operator might manually mark a track's disposition to hostile-based according to standard operating procedures (SOPs).\n\nThe entity data model includes a relationships property, which describes a predefined relationship type between two or more entities. Relationships provide the means for entities to reference other entities, enabling graph-like lookup capabilities for special processing.\n\nThe entity data model typically models relationships between entities when the existence of a relationship component triggers special treatment in the Lattice UI or for consuming services.

In newer anduril versions they can be enabled as main channels but they only have the two brightness levels you can see when they are in aux mode. The HD10 is essentially a white light only deal.

It is only nice for toys. Yes, it offers a lot of flexibility in some ways, but then it is absolutely rigid and not configurable at all in others. It also offers no way to lock configuration, so you always have a chance to screw something up by misclicking or something in the most inconvenient moment when you need the light to work.

When I ramp to Max, and 5C for momentary I get that brightness. If I 2C to max and then 5C I get memory momentary at a lower brightness. Is this because it's recognizing 2C as turbo and won't go into turbo momentary? (This also ties into my second question.) Is this because my turbo config is on option 1c instead of 2c in the 10H from on menu? \n\n\n\nSecond question:\nThe turbo configuration, 4th flash after 10H from on. \n\n. Can someone explain a few things to me; there are 3 options, 0C, 1C and 2C. \n\n0C says no turbo only ceiling; that would imply to me that there is a turbo level available beyond whatever you set your ceiling to but it's disabled. (But what if your ceiling is 150?) \n1C says ramp > 2C goes to full power (200% for dual channel lights.) I don't have dual channel so I'll omit that going forward.) \n2C says ramp> 2C goes to ceiling or full power if already at ceiling. \n \nThey second two options are a bit ambiguous, but to me it sounds like full power is considered higher than ceiling, and therefore if you are in option 1C, from anywhere in ramp 2C takes you to turbo. In option 2C, it sounds like from ramp, 2C takes you to ceiling first, then another 2C takes you to full power (turbo?)\n\nIs this correct?\n\nAnd lastly, if I set my ceiling to 150, does that mean that both option 1C and option 2C will behave the same, because 150 equals full power? \n\nI want turbo accessible, but I want it separate from Max, that way I don't enter it unnecessarily. If I need to lower my ceiling to have this ability, what number would be closest to \"high\" on a 5 level light with moon low medium high and turbo? Secondly, which turbo option do I pick, and do either of them change  the 2h from off or 3H from on function? \n\nSecond lastly, lol, is there a way to make turbo only accessible from 2H from off or 3H from on? Where 2c or ramp up will always only go as high as ceiling but you can access a brighter level with 2H off or 3H on?\n\n## Comment ID k95xdn2 with +3 score by [(SiteRelEnby, Reddit, 2023-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/17upzm1/some_anduril_2_questions_related_to_specific/k95xdn2/) (in reply to ID 17upzm1):\n>First unexpected behavior: My ceiling is set to 150.

This is a bug that has been [recently fixed](https://github.com/ToyKeeper/anduril/pull/16), although there isn't an official release with it yet, if you want I can build you a hex with it though.\n\n>(But what if your ceiling is 150?) \n\nThen it goes to 150\n\n>They second two options are a bit ambiguous, but to me it sounds like full power is considered higher than ceiling\n\nYes, full power is level 150.\n\nThis means:\n\n* 1C entered: If you are ramped to a level below your ceiling, 2C will take you to ceiling. If you already ramped all the way up, 2C will take you to full power (level 150).\n* 2C entered: 2C will always take you to full power (150/150), ceiling setting will be ignored (i.e. making ceiling only a ceiling for ramping)\n\n>And lastly, if I set my ceiling to 150, does that mean that both option 1C and option 2C will behave the same, because 150 equals full power? \n\nYes\n\n>I want turbo accessible, but I want it separate from Max, that way I don't enter it unnecessarily. If I need to lower my ceiling to have this ability, what number would be closest to \"high\" on a 5 level light with moon low medium high and turbo?\n\n130 is a common choice as well as default on quite a lot of lights, on many (not all) linear+FET lights it also represents maximum regulated (linear-only, no FET) power.\n\n>Second lastly, lol, is there a way to make turbo only accessible from 2H from off or 3H from on?

I also ended up lowering my ceiling to test what I was asking and adjusting turbo to the 2c option. \n\nThe only question I had that I felt your answer missed, was my comment about what if my ceiling is set to 150. Yes, I know that means my ceiling is 150, lol, but I think what I was getting at was, if I had the turbo set to 0C, with no turbo, but my ceiling was 150, wouldnt that cancel out the option and leave me with the turbo output, (but I would only be able to ramp up to it and I'm not sure how 2H from off would act.)\n\nAnd I thought of one other question; I'm in NYC and it's fairly bright a lot of the time so the default floor/moon is too low for me in most cases. I bumped up floor to around 30 so that in lockout the momentary floor is useful as well as the 1H to go into floor. If you raise the floor, is there any way to still access the lowest moon setting? In simple ui I see that the momentary options are moon and momentary and in advanced they are floor and momentary. Does that mean switching into simple UI and entering lockout is only way to get to absolute lowest moon without resetting it?\n\n\nAnd I don't necessarily need to program a special mode for turbo, when I want it easily accessible I turn momentary on. Like when I ride a bike through Manhattan I have the light on my neck it clipped to my jacket and I use the momentary mode like a horn, a blinker or to lookout for gigantic potholes. \n\nThanks again.\n\n#### Comment ID k9b90po with +1 score by [(SiteRelEnby, Reddit, 2023-11-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/17upzm1/some_anduril_2_questions_related_to_specific/k9b90po/) (in reply to ID k96673f):\n>  if I had the turbo set to 0C, with no turbo, but my ceiling was 150, wouldnt that cancel out the option and leave me with the turbo output, (but I would only be able to ramp up to it and I'm not sure how 2H from off would act.)\n\nYes, then you would get level 150 with 2C anyway.\n\n> If you raise the floor, is there any way to still access the lowest moon setting?\n\nYes. Set the floor to the lower level on the *other* ramp shape that you don't normally use (i.e. for the stepped ramp if you normally use smooth) then switch back to your normal ramp and set the floor to the higher level. Now 1H while locked will access the lower level of the two floors.

I also have a mod that I use on some of my lights' firmware where 3H from lockout is turbo, I can build similar other mods as well.\n\n## Comment ID k95ftvo with +3 score by [(bunglesnacks, Reddit, 2023-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/17upzm1/some_anduril_2_questions_related_to_specific/k95ftvo/) (in reply to ID 17upzm1):\nThere are technically 151 steps. 151 is turbo.\n\nTo set it to step 130 as your ceiling for instance, it's 21 clicks, or two holds and one click.\n\nI think there is a bug as far as momentary goes at ceiling level.

Besides my general hesitancy around working for the military industrial complex, if you want to go in that direction, Lockheed Martin is certainly friendlier to employee diversity than Palmer Luckey has very, very vocally been. Are Luckey's views on trans people, queer people, muslims, et cetera consistent with what the workplace is like?\n\n\nBeyond that, are ACM and IEEE ethics guidelines considered within the software and hardware teams? Autonomous weapons are an understandably controversial point of R&D, especially when, from my understanding, Anduril is willing to sell directly to Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and several other violators of international law and human rights, provided they are American allies. \n\nIn that vein, is there any freedom for employees to refuse to work directly on weapons teams? I don't mean to come across as combative, but Anduril and Luckey are very visible in the startup space for plenty of interesting and plenty of concerning reasons, which I think should be addressed to the same degree as the technical aspects of these roles. \n\nNonetheless, I don't really expect I'm going to see a response to any of this. So my only advice to other software engineers excited about more functional roles is to make sure you read into Palmer and Anduril closely ahead of applying, especially if you're coming from a community that might be particularly unwelcome according to Palmer.\n\n\nedit: the discomfort with my criticisms is disappointing, but not totally unexpected. at least Rust, Julia, and APL remain very accepting communities! and Haskell's leadership is great, too.\n\n### Comment ID lyp573a with +2 score by [(xedrac, Reddit, 2024-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1gkek8a/anduril_industries_is_hiring_summer_2025_haskell/lyp573a/) (in reply to ID lvsf0v9):\nI don't work for Anduril directly, but I've been to their HQ a few times and have done some contract work for them.  I've seen a few of their posts on here, and they often get a lot of hate, and I don't understand it.  So as someone that isn't beholden to them, let me give my perspective.  They have one of the best cultures I've seen in any company I've done work for.  I attribute that partially to Palmer and his unorthodox take on running a business and his larger-than-life attitude.  On campus you'll see one of the most diverse set of employees anywhere.  The level of competence is also very high.  I would have loved to have an internship opportunity like this when I was a budding engineer.  Sure you could go intern at Lockheed, and do your little pigeon-holed task where you are nothing more than an E1 resource label on some bean counter's spreadsheet, working on some crusty old project that has so many rules surrounding it you can't really do anything.  Or you could work on some incredibly interesting projects with a lot of really smart people around you, who all are very productive and willing to teach you what they know.  Your opportunity for growth is excellent.  There are a couple downsides though.  You might get fat because they feed you really good food every day for breakfast and lunch, and they have snacks everywhere you look.  Some of the people work very strange hours.  The flexibility is obviously very nice, but sometimes it can make it hard to coordinate with others in a timely manner.  Lastly, Anduril might raise your expectations unnecessarily high for what jobs are supposed to be like.  It will likely spoil you for all of your future jobs.  I don't say that jokingly.  Anduril really is quite special in this regard.\n\n### Comment ID lvya83p with +5 score by [(palmerluckey, Reddit, 2024-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1gkek8a/anduril_industries_is_hiring_summer_2025_haskell/lvya83p/) (in reply to ID lvsf0v9):\n*\"Lockheed Martin is certainly friendlier to employee diversity than Palmer Luckey has very, very vocally been.\"*\n\nSounds like you are just making things up.\n\n*\"is there any freedom for employees to refuse to work directly on weapons teams?\"*\n\nAnduril is a weapons company.\n\n*\"especially if you're coming from a community that might be particularly unwelcome according to Palmer\"*\n\nYou are so full of shit.\n\n#### Comment ID lvyklmn with +1 score by [(Instrume, Reddit, 2024-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1gkek8a/anduril_industries_is_hiring_summer_2025_haskell/lvyklmn/) (in reply to ID lvya83p):\n>*\"especially if you're coming from a community that might be particularly unwelcome according to Palmer\"*\n\n>You are so full of shit.\n\nSo, you're confirming that Anduril employs LGBTQIA people provided that they fit into the company culture and legally can be employed on your clearance projects?

Anduril and Luckey's particular rejection of such employees (if they are in fact in agreement) is worth me at least mentioning- I certainly wasn't disallowing people from applying to the position (honestly, I might apply anyways- I believe my security clearance is still valid). \n\nI stand by the questions being fair to ask and criticism of Anduril (even under one of their own job postings) being allowable. I also am not sure that a given defense company rejecting marginalized communities under the impression they have innately unamerican sympathies would go over well in court, though I have no reason to think Anduril is as serious a discriminator as that- I'm just referring to your point about like-minded employees. \n\nReally my concern with Anduril is mostly with Palmer, which is why I keep comparing Lockheed Martin to them. I also think Anduril goes a little bit under the radar in terms of his antics than, for instance, Musk and SpaceX, while dealing with a more serious and important to regulate industry. So I think letting people know to look into it is more than fair. Who knows, maybe I'm making the recruiters job easier too if it means they're getting less applications from either anti imperialists, gays, or russian spies.

Apparently Durendal was the name of the mythical sword of one of the emperor Charlemagne's paladins named Roland.  It was said to be the sharpest sword in existence and was used to hold off a 100,000 strong Muslim army.  It struck me as strange that if you rearranged the syllables in Durendal you could get Endural which is somewhat close to Anduril.  Coincidence???\n\nOn a side note, Roland also carried a famous oliphant which is an ivory hunting horn used to call for aid.  It looks strikingly like the horn of Gondor.  Coincidence???\n\n## Comment ID d74poa2 with +5 score by [(TacitProvidence, Reddit, 2016-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/50k46o/anduril/d74poa2/) (in reply to ID 50k46o):\nAnything to do with looks (other than what is explicitly stated by Tolkien) was not part of Tolkien's original vision. The appearance of Boromir's horn in the movies being similar to a real life horn may be coincidence, but it's also just as likely to be an inspiration.\n\nAs for Andúril and Durandal being similarly named, it's very likely that Tolkien drew upon any number of mythical blades when creating the story behind any of the blades in his stories, but the names are almost entirely constructed using his languages. That is why LotR exists at all, as a vehicle for his languages.\n\nThe only explicit reference is Avallónë, a sea port on the shores of Tol Eressëa.\n\n### Comment ID d74s6jn with +3 score by [(PurelySC, Reddit, 2016-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/50k46o/anduril/d74s6jn/) (in reply to ID d74poa2):\n>That is why LotR exists at all, as a vehicle for his languages.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but isn't that why *The Silmarillion* exists?

That cross guard doesn’t do it any favors. \n\nBut I will say this.\n\nThat pummel  mirrors the blades edge, meaning the blade and the curve of the handle match angles. So you can slide your hand onto the pummel and use it to help guide your strikes. Very effective in real combat when you need a easy way to make sure your blade is swinging true.\n\n## Comment ID j624qc5 with +1 score by [(announakis, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j624qc5/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nNot a two handed sword but a hand and a half technically.\n\n### Comment ID j64ewwk with +1 score by [(Hwarrior12, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j64ewwk/) (in reply to ID j624qc5):\nClearly two handed don't be this stupid\n\n#### Comment ID j6696wy with +1 score by [(announakis, Reddit, 2023-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j6696wy/) (in reply to ID j64ewwk):\nNarsil’s type of sword is a longsword aka bastard sword aka hand and a half sword.\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longsword\n\nA two handed sword refers specifically to a larger set of swords that appeared later known today mostly as zweihander but the real terms are epee de guerre, spadone, bidenhander etc\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_swords#Handedness\n\nWho is stupid now?\n\n## Comment ID j62vchs with +1 score by [(thebigfil, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j62vchs/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nBecause it's not real?\n\n## Comment ID j65rimb with +1 score by [(OhZvir, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j65rimb/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nI love Tolkien works and been reading and re-reading his works since I was a kid, but I never really wanted to have a movie version of this sword.

In the industry, SpaceX is known but doesn't really have a good reputation. Anduril is a newer company but they just won a billion dollar contract for SOCOM so trust me they are known. Employers evaluate your technical skills and achievements regardless of where they come from. Seeing SpaceX on your resume just means you've endured a toxic work environment. We live in a capitaistic society so your labor should go to the highest bidder. SpaceX isn't some sort of noble pursuit. They are looking to overwork and underpay you, and they are hoping the myth perpetuated by Elon and his fandom will drive you to sacrifice your personal life so they can get some cheap labor. You have to remember that working overtime as a salaried employee means you are actually making less money because the amount they pay you doesn't change so avoid it as much as possible. You will grow and learn at Anduril and you will be well compensated for it. Easy decision imo.\n\n### Comment ID ixheexs with +12 score by [(kalenxy, Reddit, 2022-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/z2ibl0/internship_spacex_starlink_anduril_or_northrop/ixheexs/) (in reply to ID ixgnde8):\nI'm not disagreeing with you in any way, you are spot on.

They had decent pay for your position, but it’s also easy to get bored at places like NG. It’s also easy to have a steady work life balance. \n\nSpacex would be the opposite. I had a Comintern at NG from SpaceX and he joked that they always users women recruiters to try to appeal more to candidates. I suspect just coincidence but I noticed it when SpaceX came to me a year ago. That being said, it seems cool but also seems miserable, they have the industry nickname of “SlaveX” for a reason. A different engineer I met at a different internship at a research lab did not return to spacex. \n\nIt’s one summer. I’d skip NG because they’ll take you on afterwards regardless if you did the internship. I’m biased slightly against Anduril/startups long term, but this is a summer where you should take relatively low risk of an internship to prepare yourself to see how good or bad things are when you go full time. SpaceX or Anduril are both great experiences, but yeah spacex will pay less and will have harder work. Both have their risks, and that’s exactly why I’d do either of them as an internship to see if I did want to work there after. I’d do Anduril just because there’s less info on day to day life and because I’d probably rather work there than spacex. That being said, dipping into RFIC can be lucrative (well, at other companies besides spacex), but I’ve heard tape outs are miserable. \n\nI personally wonder if there’s going to be a negative outlook of Musk companies down the road in the industry, but no reason to believe that.\n\n## Comment ID ixgnsw5 with +2 score by [(Chemaid, Reddit, 2022-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/z2ibl0/internship_spacex_starlink_anduril_or_northrop/ixgnsw5/) (in reply to ID z2ibl0):\nHonestly I’d think you get more RF exposure in the RF silicon team at spacex.

Its US trademark applications/registrations claim dolls, hair pins, figurines, toys and other goods and services of that nature. \n\nAnduril Industries, Inc. has a lengthy ANDURIL trademark APPLICATION for defense and military related goods and services. \n\nA trademark is a source of goods and services like brand names, logos, or slogans. Personally, I think the ANDURIL trademarks can peacefully co-exist because there isn't a likelihood of confusion between the two. Someone shopping for military defense services isn't the same person shopping for collector goods. It's not the same market, not the same budget, not the same level of buyer sophistication... (these are some of the DuPont factors, btw - that's the legal framework for evaluating likelihood of confusion). In such a case there is no question of \"allowing\" it because the goods and services are not related. If the TTAB agrees with me Anduril Industries gets the trademark registration. \n\nHowever, SZC disagrees based on the fame of the franchise. They've opposed the Anduril Industries application arguing that defense industries lie within the zone of actual use and expansion of the ANDURIL family of marks. LotR is a billion dollar franchise so it's not surprising they are vigorously defending their IP. SZC opposes a lot of trademark applications that reference or invoke LotR such as THE ONE (for boxing shirts) and BILBO (for medical supplies). \n\nAnyways, somewhere out there is a lawyer that got to put pictures of Viggo Mortenson holding a sword in his Notice of Opposition. That's cool.\n\n## Comment ID igjpyjv with +10 score by [(Thiege227, Reddit, 2022-07-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/w1ciyl/how_did_the_anduril_defense_company_get_past_lotr/igjpyjv/) (in reply to ID w1ciyl):\nI don't think LotR trademarked the name of the sword\n\n## Comment ID igjk9a5 with +7 score by [(turketron, Reddit, 2022-07-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/w1ciyl/how_did_the_anduril_defense_company_get_past_lotr/igjk9a5/) (in reply to ID w1ciyl):\nI'm curious about this as well, Palantir Technologies is another example of this, also with LotR coincidentally enough.\n\n### Comment ID igjvnup with +7 score by [(twinsfan68, Reddit, 2022-07-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/w1ciyl/how_did_the_anduril_defense_company_get_past_lotr/igjvnup/) (in reply to ID igjk9a5):\nComes down to trademark dilution and whether a consumer would confuse the two concepts . For trademark infringement a \"plaintiff must prove that it owns a valid mark, that it has priority (its rights in the mark(s) are \"senior\" to the defendant's), and that the defendant's mark is likely to cause confusion in the minds of consumers about the source or sponsorship of the goods or services offered under the parties' marks.\" \n\nAs to the confusion element, courts will consider \"whether the parties' goods and/or services are sufficiently related that consumers are likely to assume (mistakenly) that they come from a common source. Other factors that courts typically consider include how and where the parties' goods or services are advertised, marketed, and sold; the purchasing conditions; the range of prospective purchasers of the goods or services; whether there is any evidence of actual confusion caused by the allegedly infringing mark; the defendant's intent in adopting its mark; and the strength of the plaintiff's mark.\" (https://www.uspto.gov/page/about-trademark-infringement)\n\nSo first, does LOTR (Tolkien's estate, the film companies, whoever owns an interest in the \"Palantir\" name\") have a valid trademark over it? From what I know, those bodies don't have a product marketed as \"Palantir\" (unless they're selling novelty seeing crystals, which they might be). If so, it almost certainly has priority since the LOTR concept of a Palantir has been around forever, but it depends on if they have registered the mark and it's associated with a particular brand mark.\n\nWhere it falls through though is the confusion aspect. Someone searching for a \"Palantir\" trying to find the LOTR product won't accidentally stumble upon \"Palantir Technologies\" and say \"huh, these must be the folks selling the crystal seeing ball I was looking for\". It's highly unlikely to cause confusion/dilute the mark of an LOTR Palantir. Consumers can easily differentiate the two.\n\nNow if Palantir Technologies was selling, let's say, a home camera technology that used crystal balls as cameras and a big crystal ball for homeowners to monitor those camera feeds - then it might be a different story.\n\nI'm by no means a Trademark/IP attorney, but that's my (surface) understanding of the overall legal framework.\n\n## Comment ID igk00tl with +2 score by [(tysontysontyson1, Reddit, 2022-07-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/w1ciyl/how_did_the_anduril_defense_company_get_past_lotr/igk00tl/) (in reply to ID w1ciyl):\nTrademarks are for goods and services in commerce. It’s all about preventing confusion in the marketplace. A fictional sword is not in commerce, and even if it were, no one would confuse that product with a defense company.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID igkyavt with +1 score by [(CraigOpie, Reddit, 2022-07-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/w1ciyl/how_did_the_anduril_defense_company_get_past_lotr/igkyavt/) (in reply to ID w1ciyl):\nMy business' name is Death Star Developments, LLC and we are an Aerospace/Defense company that has satellites in space (round one coming soon) and have successfully completed NASA subawards.  The reason I was allowed to trademark \"Death Star\" is because Star Wars' \"Death Star\" is a toy/imaginary and what I do is real life shit - does not interfere with my International Industry Code.  There is zero chance of someone confusing the two."

How do you expect new engineers to meet tight deadlines if they're not given the proper tools and support to do so? This company has the potential to be something great, but not the way it's being ran currently. However, even outside of management, most what's being built out is glorified demoware that the government is buying into because their software hasn't been updated since the 1990's and anything new is considered to be a massive upgrade.

The few lead tech positions available have been filled by relatively inexperienced employees with with less than a year of experience, so very poor managerial choices in regard to who gets promoted. On that note, tech leadership positions are just appointments, they don't hold interviews for anyone else who may be qualified or interested. Management doesn't really seem to have much interest in developing their employees professionally. Annual review structure is disorganized at best and raises are very small (less than 2% raise each year even with a stellar review). Have to work 3-4 hours of overtime every day to even make a decent living to survive. All funding is essentially saved for the army of software engineers they hire and fire every quarter. On a weekly basis I have one or another newly graduated engineer attempt to tell me how to do my job (with over a decade of tech experience). The last several years have been nothing short of an extremely frustrating experience and huge letdown from what was promised when I quit my previous job and came here.

It seems impossible to attend a meeting or engage in a conversation without Palantir being brought up. While it's reasonable to appreciate and model after a successful business, it becomes excessive when it feels like every new hire or internal initiative mirrors Palantir. I applied for a position at Anduril with the intention of contributing to and aligning with the unique culture of Anduril.\n\nWhile there are individuals who genuinely embody the values of Anduril, a significant portion seems to adopt Palantir's entire leadership, strategic, and cultural philosophy. While Palantir has undoubtedly achieved noteworthy accomplishments, it's important to note that Palantir is not synonymous with Palmer Luckey. If individuals are joining the company solely because of Palmer, they might discover a scenario resembling Palantir 2.0, as opposed to the original vision they may have anticipated.",

Management doesn't really seem to have much interest in developing their employees professionally. Annual review structure is disorganized at best and raises are very small (less than 2% raise each year even with a stellar review). Have to work 3-4 hours of overtime every day to even make a decent living to survive. All funding is essentially saved for the army of software engineers they hire and fire every quarter. On a weekly basis I have one or another newly graduated engineer attempt to tell me how to do my job (with over a decade of tech experience).

Managers are skilled at engineering tasks, but are clueless when it comes to managing people. I've seen too many onboarding engineers left without proper support and insight into how to do their jobs well and it's actually pathetic. How do you expect new engineers to meet tight deadlines if they're not given the proper tools and support to do so? This company has the potential to be something great, but not the way it's being ran currently. However, even outside of management, most what's being built out is glorified demoware that the government is buying into because their software hasn't been updated since the 1990's and anything new is considered to be a massive upgrade.

Deliveries will begin this year and continue through the end of 2025.\n\nThe firm is already on a 10-year, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract worth up to $1 billion with U.S. Special Operations Command to supply counter-drone hardware and software, but the spokesperson would not confirm whether the new business is part of its SOCOM award.\n\nThat deal was announced in January 2022 and later that year, the command awarded Anduril $12.5 million for Roadrunner. SOCOM also requested another $19 million for the technology in its fiscal 2024 budget request.\n\nAnduril unveiled Roadrunner last December after spending two years secretly developing it with internal funding. At the time, the company’s founder Palmer Luckey told reporters that Roadrunner was in low-rate production with an initial U.S. customer for “hundreds of units.” He said the company plans to quickly scale to quantities in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nThe use of drones and loitering munitions on the battlefield has expanded in recent years. The department wants to learn from the ingenuity of the Ukrainian military, which has deployed small drones in response to Russia’s onslaught, but it also wants to develop a strong defense against the use of hostile drones by adversaries like Iran and its proxies.\n\nThe Pentagon created the Joint Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office to develop a coordinated, long-term response to drone threats in 2019, and in 2023, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks revealed a new DoD initiative called Replicator to field thousands of autonomous systems by next summer.\n\nThe department announced last week that Replicator’s next area of focus will be Counter-UAS.\n\nAccording to Anduril, Roadrunner offers a solution for both sides of the challenge. Chris Brose, the company’s chief of strategy, told reporters last December the system — which can carry a variety of payloads — was built to adapt as DOD’s needs change.\n\n“We’re very hopeful that the government will see in this capability what we see in it, which is a novel solution that is built to be adaptable to where those threats are going in the near future — which, by the way, has been a process that’s been playing out over the past few years, and it’s just going to get worse,” he said.\n\nCourtney Albon is C4ISRNET’s space and emerging technology reporter.

      "# [Decentralizing battle data: CDAO, Anduril open tactical 'mesh' to third by Sydney J. Freedberg Jr, Breaking Defense on 2024-12-13](https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/decentralizing-battle-data-cdao-anduril-open-tactical-mesh-to-third-party-developers/)\nWASHINGTON — As the US military embraces artificial intelligence and big data, the Pentagon is trying to wean itself from reliance on centralized mega-systems and instead empower frontline leaders at the “tactical edge.”\n\nThat’s why, last week, the Pentagon’s Chief Digital & AI Office (CDAO) awarded startup defense firm Anduril a $100 million, three-year contract to expand its Lattice Mesh. Lattice is a system that lets frontline forces rapidly access data from over a hundred different types of sensors — for example, to track incoming hostile drones — over existing tactical networks, without having to first relay that data through central processing hubs.\n\nThen, this week, Anduril released a Lattice Software Development Kit (SDK) that will allow other companies to build their own applications to run on Lattice Mesh, without having to get permission from Anduril. The company announced an initial list of 10 partners, ranging from startups like Apex (space systems) and Saronic (unmanned boats) to giants like Oracle and Textron. But in the future, an Anduril executive told Breaking Defense, any company can access the kit and write software for Lattice.\n\n“We want to remove Anduril as any form of bottleneck … and allow anyone to be publishing [apps and data] to the Lattice Mesh,” said senior VP Thomas Keane. “What the SDK allows is now for third parties to do it without relying on Anduril.”\n\nRELATED: Anduril could receive up to $100M for Space Surveillance Network upgrade\n\nIt’s a decentralized business model for a decentralized military system. It’s also a departure from traditional practice for both the defense industry and the Defense Department, which historically favor centralized mega-projects where a single lead contractor can achieve “vendor lock” and keep competitors out for decades. But the recent Lattice Mesh announcements suggest the rise of a more open, flexible and adaptable approach.\n\n“If we know anything about the future, it’s that we don’t know that much about the future,” said CDAO Principal Deputy Margaret Palmieri. “Technology is changing really fast, the mission space is changing really fast, and the combinations of capabilities that we need to bring together … require the Department to be much more agile than in the past.”\n\nIn such an unpredictable world, Palmieri said, military programs must be able to bring on new capabilities quickly from whoever can provide the best tech in the least time. (CDAO’s acquisition model for this approach is formally called Open DAGIR). Releasing the SDK makes that adaptability possible for Lattice.\n\n“We can use the data mesh back end that Anduril has, but we don’t only have to rely on Anduril apps,” she told Breaking Defense. “We can now invite other third-party app developers in from anywhere in the ecosystem that is our incredible advantage as a as a nation.”\n\nWhat’s in it for Anduril? While Keane didn’t say so outright, the firm is clearly betting that an open door on Lattice Mesh is good for business, much as Apple benefits from letting third parties develop applications for their iPhones: More third-party options make the underlying product more useful, so it sells better.\n\nThe C-3PO Approach\n\nSpecifically, what makes Lattice useful to the military is that it lets frontline units access (or “subscribe to”) data feeds from a host of different sensors, Keane and Palmieri explained. Those sensors are operated by many different organizations, communicate over different networks, and use different, incompatible formats; so, historically, the intelligence they gather has to be sent back to a central hub for processing before it can be widely shared. But that process takes precious time that forces in combat may not have. It relies on long-range transmissions, communications satellites and other relays that a sophisticated adversary could jam or destroy.\n\nBy contrast, Lattice Mesh gives a frontline unit its own digital “translator” to talk to different sensors directly. It’s a bit like the golden droid C-3PO in Star Wars, “fluent in over six million forms of communication.” That allows data sharing “on the edge,” with many units talking to many sensors, without the delays and vulnerabilities of a centralized hub-and-spoke system.\n\nToday, after several years of closed-door experimentation with CDAO and limited deployments at operational Combatant Commands, Lattice Mesh now has translator algorithms for more than a hundred different types of sensors, Keane said, “and we are adding new ‘languages’ every week.”\n\nBut by releasing the Lattice SDK to third parties, he went on, Anduril lets other companies — drone makers, satellite operators, sensor manufacturers and more — build their own translators for their own products. The more companies do that, the more types of sensors the military can use Lattice for.\n\nThis open-door, decentralized approach is not unique to Lattice Mesh. Indeed, Lattice is just one of several pieces of the military’s evolving capability to share intelligence and transmit orders across US and allied forces on land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace — known as Combined Joint All-Domain Command & Control (CJADC2).\n\nOver time, the military has backed off from one-size-fits-all approaches to CJADC2. Instead of imposing a single universal data standard and a single mega-network, it’s moving towards a “federated” approach that allows different systems for different niches but tries to make them all compatible.\n\nThat wasn’t obvious from the start, Palmieri emphasized. “When we started off in January of 2023, we thought … we could find one capability that would do all those things,” she told Breaking Defense. But through a series of quarterly Global Information Dominance Experiments, “what we realized was that there wasn’t a single data integration layer that you could select as best of breed across all those organizations and missions … What you needed at the strategic and operational level for data integration was different than what we needed at a tactical level.”\n\nWhen CDAO released the initial operational toolkit for CJADC2 — officially called the “Minimum Viable Capability” and publicly announced in February — it focused on strategic coordination at the four-star Combatant Commands. But data-sharing tools for headquarters staff aren’t suitable for combat units, Palmieri said. Headquarters need huge amounts of information to produce detailed plans in hours or days; frontline commanders need much smaller volumes of data, but they need it right now.\n\nThat second niche is where Lattice Mesh came in. “The data mesh capability is not the answer for everything,” Palmieri said. “What we found with the data mesh that Anduril provided was it was really good at that low-latency data exchange.”\n\n“What CDAO asked us for is the ability to use this data in near real-time decisions at the edge,” Keane said. “We measure time in seconds, not in hours or days.”",
