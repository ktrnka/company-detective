I specialized in aeronautics during undergrad. I have worked in flight sciences departments for major DoD contractors since the mid-2010s. Most recently, I have been a Mechanical Design Engineer with a heavy focus on GD&T, 3D drawings & manufacturability for a more civilian Fortune500 company, yet still had a healthy diet of legacy defense clientele. I say all of that to say that I strongly believe that I am qualified to work in this space & take any opportunity to do so very seriously.\n\nI first came across Area-I about 5 years ago. They reached out to me personally & asked me to apply to some positions, which I did as I was a young engineer still trying to navigate my early career. I never heard anything back from them either way. This really rubbed me the wrong way because time is incredibly valuable & I don’t believe it’s that hard to show courtesy to somebody you began a conversation with. Especially when it comes to employment opportunities.\n\nFast forward to this year, Area-I has now been acquired into the Anduril Industries family of organizations somewhere along the timeline between 2018 & 2023. Almost an identical series of events unfolded; Anduril reached out to me letting me know that Area-I is now a subsidiary & they would like for me to apply for some open positions at their new facility in Atlanta, GA.\n\nI’m thinking this is perfect timing. I’ve been looking to settle down in a role after a couple of years of traveling across the country for different projects & Atlanta is the perfect place for me being that I’m based in the area. I shared all of this with the technical recruiter during my initial phone screening & how I had run across Area-I years ago & never heard anything back. They assured me that Anduril was a new organization & was more attentive to their correspondence. So reluctantly, I applied to a few positions.\n\nThis was all in late January/Early February of this year. Weeks roll by. Months roll by. Didn’t hear anything back.\n\nThen all of a sudden, they’re rushing me into an interview for a Mechanical Engineer position. I accept the interview in mid-April. It went well. Or so I thought.\n\nMy interview was with two engineers who were both several years younger than me, which was surprising considering I’m barely touching 30. One was holding the title of “Mechanical Engineer IV” after only being at the company for 3 years, which I thought was…odd but ok. Didn’t think much of it besides hard work, amazing accomplishments, opportunities for growth & promotion, etc. which is what I had been looking for during my career search.\n\nThey had assembled some screenshots of mechanical drawings, machined pieces & FBDs to “see how I thought about problem-solving” into a virtual whiteboard called Miro.\n\nThey were stumbling over themselves mid-question to constantly reiterate “this isn’t a test. This isn’t a quiz. We just want to see your thought process”.\n\nSo I answered all the questions honestly & thoroughly. I feel like I only struggled with one question that the younger of the two had asked me because it was about designing a camera in the desert to continously track a UAV given the flight parh. Admittedly, I thought this one was odd but unique. Also answered that one honestly to the best of my ability.\n\nBy the end of the technical segment of the interview, which lasted 45 mins, I solved 3 separate FBDs. One considering a U-2 in SLUF, one considering the moment forces acting on the airfoil of the same U-2 & one describing the magnitude of lift forces on a group of airfoils given the internal structures. The older of the two complimented my FBDs at the end of these questions.\n\nThe last 15 mins of the interview was scheduled for open discussion, which I happily used to ask each of them about their respective teams, their journeys to Anduril, as well as how/why this position came open in the first place. You know, doing my due diligence to try to see what I could potentially be walking into.\n\nThe younger one barely answered any of the questions. Just followed the older engineer with typical generic, uninterested responses, e.g., “nothing else to add” or “he said what I was going to say”, which was the first red flag. But again, I didn’t think much of it due to his age. Thinking he couldn’t have much experience/polished interpersonal skills running an interview. That’s a specific skillset, so I give him grace.\n\nFinally, I closed out by thanking each of them for their time & asking specifics about next steps to make sure I wouldn’t have to wait another 2-3 months to hear back from them. They told me the next step is an on-site interview with the team so everyone can get more acquainted & I’d get to see their brand new facility that they just moved into a few months ago. They let me know that this time their *internal* technical recruiter would set it up “within the next two weeks but we don’t want to speak to her pace or workload”.\n\n### Comment ID jkerug6 with +25 score by [(vizualthewanderer, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AerospaceEngineering/comments/13jf2g4/my_experience_interviewing_with_anduril_industries/jkerug6/) (in reply to ID jkertnr):\nFast forward to a week later, I get an email from the external technical recruiter that originally screened my application & pushed it through. This was very surprising to me, considering it was way before the “two week” period that I was cited with, it wasn’t the internal member & this member is from a different country. But me trying to be optimistic, I’m thinking they’re just trying to keep striking while the iron is hot. Boy was I in for a rude awakening.\n\nShe tells me the team is no longer considering me for the position. I’m actually taken aback by all of this. She’s been pretty responsive in the past, so I email her back almost immediately about any specific feedback that was given as to how they arrived at this decision.\n\nY’all. She replied back, acknowledging that the team said they had a great conversation with me but when asked about the qualifications she basically said these two guys told her that I lacked detail & understanding on EVERYTHING. Especially my FBDs.\n\nNow, I’m actually really confused by this point. Not only did I answer every question, every follow-up & entertain their “what if” scenarios off script of the given questions. I specifically remember being praised on my FBDs. My confusion & astonishment is now beginning to turn into irritation & anger.\n\nNone of that feedback was given to me during either portion of the interview. Not during the technical, not during the discussion. Before I get too wrapped up in calling them on their bullshit, I remember I had submitted applications for other open positions in flight sciences & systems design divisions. So I politely inquire about the status of those applications because they all were submitted within days of the Mechanical Engineer & I have yet to hear anything back.\n\nShe retorts “that’s not what I’m responsible for but I’ll see if I can check. Best wishes”. Not even a full 24 hours later, I get an email from a new technical recruiter that I’ve never shared correspondence with before, probably external as well. He says they’re not moving forward with **any** of my applications in the entire flight sciences department. Which tells me that a) they’ve been sitting on them for months & never said anything or b) they allowed the feedback from a different team influence their decision to not consider me for any open positions in an entirely different division. \n\nNow I’m starting to feel like I was being lied to, intentionally misled or dealing with a disingenuous situation altogether. I shared that opinion in my last email with her & I hope I never hear back from anybody associated with them ever again. I don’t even care to hear what the Systems Design division has to say at this point.\n\nIn conclusion, Anduril Industries was a horrible experience all the way around. They might’ve absorbed Area-I & other subsidiaries into their brand but they still have the same culture of not knowing what they’re asking for & penalizing others for it.\n\nFair warning to the rest of you. Hope everyone finds success elsewhere. Thanks for taking precious time out of your lives to read this. I, for one, appreciate how valuable that is.\n\n[Link](https://jobs.lever.co/anduril/6d1d3044-f647-4d05-9205-b7fd96cfbab1) to the actual position description.\n\nCheers.\n\n#### Comment ID kdi6izt with +5 score by [(CovertEngineering2, Reddit, 2023-12-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AerospaceEngineering/comments/13jf2g4/my_experience_interviewing_with_anduril_industries/kdi6izt/) (in reply to ID jkerug6):\nI’ve found a lot of people can find ways to discredit those who intimidate them (you are older and answered everything well.

My position was for an Engineer I position and I felt like I had a good experience. \n\n\nI started with a Miro whiteboard interview with a panel of about 4 engineers (all around my age, slightly older). That went pretty well and I felt like clicked with them. Some questions I remember included design considerations for an antenna tracker and airfoil structural supports. Later on, I had my in-person interview. They booked my flight for me and I was reimbursed for all of my Uber rides. I had to do a presentation on a technical project with another panel, and then had a facility tour. It honestly looked like a really fun place to work for in 2021. After my in-person interview, I had another interview with a much older man (some vice president). That interview was mostly cultural and “why do you want to work here.” That went well and I received an offer later. The salary was ~69k with some stock stuff that I don’t remember. In the end I took my only other offer mainly because I wanted to stay in California.\n\n### Comment ID kufsqvm with +1 score by [(farts_wars, Reddit, 2024-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AerospaceEngineering/comments/13jf2g4/my_experience_interviewing_with_anduril_industries/kufsqvm/) (in reply to ID jkh2j4v):\nWhere was this position located if not California?

I would have also been frustrated if they told me to apply and I never heard back, though.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI was asked the same questions during my interview. Based on how you have described your skills and experience, I am also surprised you didn't get an offer. AREA-I really emphasizes cultural fits during the interview process. I have heard of similarly qualified candidates being turned down because they wouldn't fit the company culture. Since your other applications were turned down quickly after your first interview, my hunch is that they didn't think you'd be a good character fit. That being said, that's not consistent with what they said about you \"lacking detail and understanding\". It could be a little of both. Maybe you didn't answer as well as you think you did.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThe \"stumbling over themselves to reiterate that it wasn't a test\" bit may have been because they thought you were nervous or they didn't like your answers? My interview was pretty informal but I thought it was well conducted.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAlso, a Mechanical Engineer III here is equivalent to a I at another company, so your interviewers weren't too far up the chain.\n\n### Comment ID kbmx370 with +1 score by [(Kleanish, Reddit, 2023-12-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AerospaceEngineering/comments/13jf2g4/my_experience_interviewing_with_anduril_industries/kbmx370/) (in reply to ID jks3erv):\nI don’t know how i found myself here but anyway.

When I ramp to Max, and 5C for momentary I get that brightness. If I 2C to max and then 5C I get memory momentary at a lower brightness. Is this because it's recognizing 2C as turbo and won't go into turbo momentary? (This also ties into my second question.) Is this because my turbo config is on option 1c instead of 2c in the 10H from on menu? \n\n\n\nSecond question:\nThe turbo configuration, 4th flash after 10H from on. \n\n. Can someone explain a few things to me; there are 3 options, 0C, 1C and 2C. \n\n0C says no turbo only ceiling; that would imply to me that there is a turbo level available beyond whatever you set your ceiling to but it's disabled. (But what if your ceiling is 150?) \n1C says ramp > 2C goes to full power (200% for dual channel lights.) I don't have dual channel so I'll omit that going forward.) \n2C says ramp> 2C goes to ceiling or full power if already at ceiling. \n \nThey second two options are a bit ambiguous, but to me it sounds like full power is considered higher than ceiling, and therefore if you are in option 1C, from anywhere in ramp 2C takes you to turbo. In option 2C, it sounds like from ramp, 2C takes you to ceiling first, then another 2C takes you to full power (turbo?)\n\nIs this correct?\n\nAnd lastly, if I set my ceiling to 150, does that mean that both option 1C and option 2C will behave the same, because 150 equals full power? \n\nI want turbo accessible, but I want it separate from Max, that way I don't enter it unnecessarily. If I need to lower my ceiling to have this ability, what number would be closest to \"high\" on a 5 level light with moon low medium high and turbo? Secondly, which turbo option do I pick, and do either of them change  the 2h from off or 3H from on function? \n\nSecond lastly, lol, is there a way to make turbo only accessible from 2H from off or 3H from on? Where 2c or ramp up will always only go as high as ceiling but you can access a brighter level with 2H off or 3H on?\n\n## Comment ID k95xdn2 with +4 score by [(SiteRelEnby, Reddit, 2023-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/17upzm1/some_anduril_2_questions_related_to_specific/k95xdn2/) (in reply to ID 17upzm1):\n>First unexpected behavior: My ceiling is set to 150.

Is this because it's recognizing 2C as turbo and won't go into turbo momentary?\n\nYes. This is a bug that has been [recently fixed](https://github.com/ToyKeeper/anduril/pull/16), although there isn't an official release with it yet, if you want I can build you a hex with it though.\n\n>(But what if your ceiling is 150?) \n\nThen it goes to 150\n\n>They second two options are a bit ambiguous, but to me it sounds like full power is considered higher than ceiling\n\nYes, full power is level 150.\n\nThis means:\n\n* 1C entered: If you are ramped to a level below your ceiling, 2C will take you to ceiling. If you already ramped all the way up, 2C will take you to full power (level 150).\n* 2C entered: 2C will always take you to full power (150/150), ceiling setting will be ignored (i.e. making ceiling only a ceiling for ramping)\n\n>And lastly, if I set my ceiling to 150, does that mean that both option 1C and option 2C will behave the same, because 150 equals full power? \n\nYes\n\n>I want turbo accessible, but I want it separate from Max, that way I don't enter it unnecessarily. If I need to lower my ceiling to have this ability, what number would be closest to \"high\" on a 5 level light with moon low medium high and turbo?\n\n130 is a common choice as well as default on quite a lot of lights, on many (not all) linear+FET lights it also represents maximum regulated (linear-only, no FET) power.\n\n>Second lastly, lol, is there a way to make turbo only accessible from 2H from off or 3H from on?

I also ended up lowering my ceiling to test what I was asking and adjusting turbo to the 2c option. \n\nThe only question I had that I felt your answer missed, was my comment about what if my ceiling is set to 150. Yes, I know that means my ceiling is 150, lol, but I think what I was getting at was, if I had the turbo set to 0C, with no turbo, but my ceiling was 150, wouldnt that cancel out the option and leave me with the turbo output, (but I would only be able to ramp up to it and I'm not sure how 2H from off would act.)\n\nAnd I thought of one other question; I'm in NYC and it's fairly bright a lot of the time so the default floor/moon is too low for me in most cases. I bumped up floor to around 30 so that in lockout the momentary floor is useful as well as the 1H to go into floor. If you raise the floor, is there any way to still access the lowest moon setting? In simple ui I see that the momentary options are moon and momentary and in advanced they are floor and momentary. Does that mean switching into simple UI and entering lockout is only way to get to absolute lowest moon without resetting it?\n\n\nAnd I don't necessarily need to program a special mode for turbo, when I want it easily accessible I turn momentary on. Like when I ride a bike through Manhattan I have the light on my neck it clipped to my jacket and I use the momentary mode like a horn, a blinker or to lookout for gigantic potholes. \n\nThanks again.\n\n#### Comment ID k9b90po with +1 score by [(SiteRelEnby, Reddit, 2023-11-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/17upzm1/some_anduril_2_questions_related_to_specific/k9b90po/) (in reply to ID k96673f):\n>  if I had the turbo set to 0C, with no turbo, but my ceiling was 150, wouldnt that cancel out the option and leave me with the turbo output, (but I would only be able to ramp up to it and I'm not sure how 2H from off would act.)\n\nYes, then you would get level 150 with 2C anyway.\n\n> If you raise the floor, is there any way to still access the lowest moon setting?\n\nYes. Set the floor to the lower level on the *other* ramp shape that you don't normally use (i.e. for the stepped ramp if you normally use smooth) then switch back to your normal ramp and set the floor to the higher level. Now 1H while locked will access the lower level of the two floors. If you have a manual memory level set, 2H will use this level, otherwise it will use the higher of the two floors.\n\nhttp://toykeeper.net/torches/fsm/anduril2/anduril-manual.txt\n\n>And I don't necessarily need to program a special mode for turbo, when I want it easily accessible I turn momentary on. Like when I ride a bike through Manhattan I have the light on my neck it clipped to my jacket and I use the momentary mode like a horn, a blinker or to lookout for gigantic potholes. \n\nThe easiest way is to update to the latest version and use tactical mode for that. Hanklights (except the M44) ship with older firmware versions that don't have tactical mode but they're all designed to be updatable. I also have a mod that I use on some of my lights' firmware where 3H from lockout is turbo, I can build similar other mods as well.\n\n## Comment ID k95ftvo with +3 score by [(bunglesnacks, Reddit, 2023-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/17upzm1/some_anduril_2_questions_related_to_specific/k95ftvo/) (in reply to ID 17upzm1):\nThere are technically 151 steps. 151 is turbo.\n\nTo set it to step 130 as your ceiling for instance, it's 21 clicks, or two holds and one click.\n\nI think there is a bug as far as momentary goes at ceiling level.

Besides my general hesitancy around working for the military industrial complex, if you want to go in that direction, Lockheed Martin is certainly friendlier to employee diversity than Palmer Luckey has very, very vocally been. Are Luckey's views on trans people, queer people, muslims, et cetera consistent with what the workplace is like?\n\n\nBeyond that, are ACM and IEEE ethics guidelines considered within the software and hardware teams? Autonomous weapons are an understandably controversial point of R&D, especially when, from my understanding, Anduril is willing to sell directly to Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and several other violators of international law and human rights, provided they are American allies. \n\nIn that vein, is there any freedom for employees to refuse to work directly on weapons teams? I don't mean to come across as combative, but Anduril and Luckey are very visible in the startup space for plenty of interesting and plenty of concerning reasons, which I think should be addressed to the same degree as the technical aspects of these roles. \n\nNonetheless, I don't really expect I'm going to see a response to any of this. So my only advice to other software engineers excited about more functional roles is to make sure you read into Palmer and Anduril closely ahead of applying, especially if you're coming from a community that might be particularly unwelcome according to Palmer.\n\n\nedit: the discomfort with my criticisms is disappointing, but not totally unexpected. at least Rust, Julia, and APL remain very accepting communities! and Haskell's leadership is great, too.\n\n### Comment ID lvswjua with +2 score by [(Instrume, Reddit, 2024-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1gkek8a/anduril_industries_is_hiring_summer_2025_haskell/lvswjua/) (in reply to ID lvsf0v9):\nIIRC Anduril (I don't think it was Palantir) will ask upfront in interviews if you have any issues with American \"imperialism\", and if you don't agree with their stance you should go home, not least since you are likely unlikely to obtain the security clearances needed to work with them (i.e, the chances of the Chinese or Russians sending you a recruitment e-mail and you responding affirmatively are too high).\n\n  \nI think the rumor was, that the cost of the background check needed for a civilian clearance was around 20k a couple of years back, and is likely more now considering inflation having kicked in. The clearance check is paid for by the company, so, let's say, they file for your clearance investigation despite known red flags, and you're not approved. That means, not only did they tie up a slot for you, delaying hiring of retainable employees, they also paid more than 20,000 USD to do the clearance investigation and got nothing for it.\n\n\n\nIn any programming community, you'll have divergence of political views given the diverse backgrounds of its users.

Anduril and Luckey's particular rejection of such employees (if they are in fact in agreement) is worth me at least mentioning- I certainly wasn't disallowing people from applying to the position (honestly, I might apply anyways- I believe my security clearance is still valid). \n\nI stand by the questions being fair to ask and criticism of Anduril (even under one of their own job postings) being allowable. I also am not sure that a given defense company rejecting marginalized communities under the impression they have innately unamerican sympathies would go over well in court, though I have no reason to think Anduril is as serious a discriminator as that- I'm just referring to your point about like-minded employees. \n\nReally my concern with Anduril is mostly with Palmer, which is why I keep comparing Lockheed Martin to them. I also think Anduril goes a little bit under the radar in terms of his antics than, for instance, Musk and SpaceX, while dealing with a more serious and important to regulate industry. So I think letting people know to look into it is more than fair. Who knows, maybe I'm making the recruiters job easier too if it means they're getting less applications from either anti imperialists, gays, or russian spies.

This is a unique opportunity to use Haskell to implement high performance applications in an embedded setting. Anduril has adopted Nix at large and we use IOG's generously maintained Haskell.nix project to build all of our Haskell code and ship it to thousands of customer assets across the globe. If you have Haskell experience and are interested in any of:\n\n- Software defined radios\n\n- Digital signal processing\n\n- Numerical computing\n\n- FPGAs\n\n- Linux drivers/systems programming\n\n- Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS\n\n- Dhall\n\n  \nplease do drop me a line at [travis@anduril.com](mailto:travis@anduril.com), and please also submit your application to our online portal here: [https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/andurilindustries/jobs/4460811007?gh\\_jid=4460811007](https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/andurilindustries/jobs/4460811007?gh_jid=4460811007)\n\nTo tackle a few common questions:\n\n- Yes, Anduril is an American defense technology company. We build weapons systems for the United States and its allies.\n\n- This is a \\_Haskell\\_ role. It is not a bait and switch. We are writing applications in GHC Haskell, not some homegrown Haskell-like language or some other programming language. That said, knowledge of C, Rust, or Typescript would be a valuable differentiating factor, as we often rub elbows with codebases that use these languages as well.\n\n- This is an on-site role at Anduril headquarters in Costa Mesa, California. Our team is building software for hardware products, so physical presence in our RF lab is often required throughout the course of software development and testing. Remote work would only be considered for candidates with something extraordinary to offer to our team.\n\n  \nI'd be happy to answer any other questions in the thread below.\n\n## Comment ID lk9vejf with +13 score by [(MasalDosa69, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1f2x743/anduril_industries_electromagnetic_warfare_team/lk9vejf/) (in reply to ID 1f2x743):\nDo you require citizenship?\n\n### Comment ID lkcwgfy with +4 score by [(mjuad, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1f2x743/anduril_industries_electromagnetic_warfare_team/lkcwgfy/) (in reply to ID lk9vejf):\nThey require a TS/SCI clearance, which implies citizenship.\n\n### Comment ID lkcxpe2 with +5 score by [(develop7, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1f2x743/anduril_industries_electromagnetic_warfare_team/lkcxpe2/) (in reply to ID lk9vejf):\nQuoth https://www.state.gov/security-clearance-faqs/:\n\n> *Do I have to be a U.S. citizen to receive a security clearance from the Department of State?*\n> \n> Yes.

Thiel hires bright eyed interns from the top tech schools then has them code up whatever the heck the customer will pay for.

It’s systems are already being deployed in conflicts, such as the Sentry tower in the US-Mexico border and I think the Altius-600 was sent to Ukraine.

It gives you the option to have 6 distinct levels instead of three, but only if you want to. It also gives you the option to instantly select a level, but only if you want to.  If I actually had friends, I could set up a group to only one brightness level and not have to worry about it, just like I could do with Anduril. \n\nProgramming a ZL is very different and less intuitive than Anduril. But, like Anduril, once it's set up how you like it, you never have to mess with it again. \n\nBut I wouldn't give a ZL nor an Anduril light as a gift.\n\n## Comment ID jaqki4v with +5 score by [(IAmJerv, Reddit, 2023-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/11gvw0o/favorite_nonanduril_flashlights/jaqki4v/) (in reply to ID 11gvw0o):\nIf you want a well-built flashlight that does not have the UI complexities many think are exclusive to Anduril, then Acebeam is probably your best bet.

And the E70 Mini is nice too, if you want to give bigger and brighter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have to ask though... who has to click five times with Anduril? Serious question. If \"click for on at last brightness, double click for Turbo, hold to cycle brightness, click for off\" is overwhelming then Skilhunt and Zebra are *definitely* off limits, as are the IF22a, FC11, many Convoys, and most other lights that are seen as \"simpler\" despite operating the same way.

All **strictly** optional.\n\nI never **need** to click more than twice. Simpler. So simple that my wife, a non-techy, figured it out in under two minutes without a diagram, manual, or verbal instruction. Sure, she can't do the fancy stuff that she has no interest in doing, like calibrating the thermals, but she can do everything that needs to be done; on/off and bright/dim. And that's stuff I only do once with every light I get; I haven't even bothered memorizing the commands. \n\nUnless you do an act that requires intent since it's \"Infinite monkeys\"-level improbable to happen accidentally, Anduril **can't** do the things that you seem to thing are a 420% mandatory part of daily usage. \n\nThe UI on your IF22A is basically Anduril Simple UI. It just lacks the ability to unlock Advanced Mode, which is the part so many folks think they need to know even though they don't. Look at how many people manage to drive without having the skills to adjust the fuel mixture and ignition timing on their cars, or even bothering with cruise control; a feature many cars have and most people simply ignore instead of being overwhelmed and unable to drive any car that has it.\n\nIn the end, it's all a matter of perspective. And until I see a provable difference between \"click for on at last brightness, double click for Turbo, hold to cycle brightness, click for off\" and \"click for on at last brightness, double click for Turbo, hold to cycle brightness, click for off\", it's going to be hard to convince me that removing options that are behind a locked door anyways actually makes things simpler.\n\n#### Comment ID jar5y2j with +4 score by [(Y0u_stupid_cunt, Reddit, 2023-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/11gvw0o/favorite_nonanduril_flashlights/jar5y2j/) (in reply to ID jaqmv6u):\n>There are several anduril modes/features that require more than 5 clicks, some are seven\n\nIt seems like you're unaware that anduril 2 has a \"simple\" mode where all of that is locked out.

If I grab a drill and hang a shell, the drill didn't hang the shelf. I did. We don't try the knife when someone gets stabbed. We try the person wielding the knife. \n\nIgnoring that for a moment, there's no actual evidence Glamdring delivers the killing blow to Durin's Bane. The evidence suggests that it's the fall that kills it. Glamdring is also only one of Gandalf's three weapons in that fight (the sword, the staff, and the magic). Sting also doesn't kill Shelob; if Tolkien wanted to indicate that she died, he would have been more explicit. We don't assume that the Watcher in the Water was killed, so we shouldn't assume Shelob was killed. As for the other weapons mentioned? They're not exactly legendary weapons. They're just well-made weapons. They're not magical.\n\nAragorn's strengths don't come from his ability to wield a sword (though he's very good at it). They come from other things. His ability to survive in the wild, to track the Hobbits, to invoke an ancient oath and bind the Army of the Dead, to convince the Rohirrim and later Gondorians to support him as Isildur's Heir, and his absolute fearlessness in facing down the worst the enemy has to offer in the hopes of giving Frodo time to destroy the Ring.

It legitimises Aragorn's claim to the throne. It also rallies people to his cause. The soldiers of the fiefs of Gondor would not have followed any random person to Minas Tirith. They follow Aragorn because he claims to be Isildur's heir. And this claim is backed up because he carries Elendil's sword \n\nPlus the most important thing Anduril does is scare the everloving s**t out of Sauron. He launches his attack on Minas Tirith prematurely because Aragorn shows him the sword of Elendil in the palantir of isengard. This allows Frodo to sneak into Mordor via Cirth Ungol and also leads to a victory on the Pelennor fields. \n\nLater when the heir of Elendil marches to Mordor, he emptied his land to face him. This again enables Frodo to reach Mount Doom without being detected. So the sword is a symbol. It encourages and rallies the free people and scares the enemies. That is much better than just being a weapon that is good at killing. Also since it was first made in Numenor and then reforged by the Noldor, it is also very good at killing.\n\n## Comment ID k6nbom2 with +5 score by [(j1h15233, Reddit, 2023-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/17hf1sr/anduril_is_the_least_impressive_weapon_of_the/k6nbom2/) (in reply to ID 17hf1sr):\nSo the least impressive weapon is the one that summons an army of the dead?

You guys are all too wrapped up in D&D views of the world. LOTR is myth and legend. Tolkien is steeped in those. Narsil/Anduril is the sword that led the Last Alliance.

Seeing it coming toward them half defeats it’s enemies. It flames in the sun and is meant to lead the resistance to all who are evil. \n\nThe story is not about which weapon kills who.

Anduril, Flame of the West was proof that Aragorn was the heir of Isildur. It was also an inspiration to those who fought alongside him. Narsil was extremely sharp and strong, forged by the dwarven smith Telchar “in the deeps of time,” and was stated to be even stronger when it was reforged as Anduril. It had a red hue during battle and cleaved iron and flesh “as it were green wood” just like Angrist, the other blade forged by Telchar, which cut a Silmaril from the iron crown of Morgoth. There is a paragraph in LotR describing how, with a flash like a flame, Anduril was brought down on an orc and cleaved both helmet and head in two. Also, there is that whole thing with “death shall come to any who wield it save Elendil’s heir.” And this isn’t really the sword itself, but the sheath Aragorn keeps it in was given to him by Galadriel, who said the sword kept in that sheath will not break in victory or defeat.\n\nEdit: Telchar was a dwarf, not an elf\n\n### Comment ID k6oiqrc with +2 score by [(tappthis, Reddit, 2023-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/17hf1sr/anduril_is_the_least_impressive_weapon_of_the/k6oiqrc/) (in reply to ID k6oe8mt):\nWrong, it wasnt isildur's sword.

In the industry, SpaceX is known but doesn't really have a good reputation. Anduril is a newer company but they just won a billion dollar contract for SOCOM so trust me they are known. Employers evaluate your technical skills and achievements regardless of where they come from. Seeing SpaceX on your resume just means you've endured a toxic work environment. We live in a capitaistic society so your labor should go to the highest bidder. SpaceX isn't some sort of noble pursuit. They are looking to overwork and underpay you, and they are hoping the myth perpetuated by Elon and his fandom will drive you to sacrifice your personal life so they can get some cheap labor. You have to remember that working overtime as a salaried employee means you are actually making less money because the amount they pay you doesn't change so avoid it as much as possible. You will grow and learn at Anduril and you will be well compensated for it. Easy decision imo.\n\n### Comment ID ixheexs with +13 score by [(kalenxy, Reddit, 2022-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/z2ibl0/internship_spacex_starlink_anduril_or_northrop/ixheexs/) (in reply to ID ixgnde8):\nI'm not disagreeing with you in any way, you are spot on. However, it's important to remember that an internship experience isn't equivalent to being a full-time employee somewhere. While SpaceX might not be a desirable place to work full time, it's possible that they have a good intern experience. At the same time, I have seen companies that I know are great places to work give their interns practically nothing to do during their internship.\n\n#### Comment ID ixhpxig with +25 score by [(Navynuke00, Reddit, 2022-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/z2ibl0/internship_spacex_starlink_anduril_or_northrop/ixhpxig/) (in reply to ID ixheexs):\n>While SpaceX might not be a desirable place to work full time, it's possible that they have a good intern experience.\n\n(Morgan Freeman voice)\n\nThey don't.\n\n### Comment ID ixhgdss with +1 score by [(NotAHost, Reddit, 2022-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/z2ibl0/internship_spacex_starlink_anduril_or_northrop/ixhgdss/) (in reply to ID ixgnde8):\nFor some reason I thought I read there was some issues with the Anduril contract.\n\n## Comment ID ixhk9kp with +27 score by [(bobj33, Reddit, 2022-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/z2ibl0/internship_spacex_starlink_anduril_or_northrop/ixhk9kp/) (in reply to ID z2ibl0):\nEveryone says that SpaceX and Tesla are sweatshops and after the last month there is no way I'd ever work for Elon.\n\nThe pay at Anduril is far and away the highest.

Anduril is so far ahead, massive night and day difference. Your work environment will be light-years better and you touch more actual work rather than busy work.

She decided on day one to work only a 50 hours a week. They didn’t fire her but at the end of the internship her manager said to not expect a job offer when she graduated, she wouldn’t have taken it she did, because they said although she was clearly smart and will be a good engineer, her working only 10 hours a day and not coming in on Saturday showed a lack of dedication to the company.

Also work life balance at NG is great. SpaceX will work you like a dog from what I hear with people I know. \n\nAs well it’s an internship, so it is what you make out of it. Yes you may not do much but with a lot of work being on the closed side they don’t typically give interns access. And since it’s usually 10 weeks you can’t really get a grasp for a program especially.

They had decent pay for your position, but it’s also easy to get bored at places like NG. It’s also easy to have a steady work life balance. \n\nSpacex would be the opposite. I had a Comintern at NG from SpaceX and he joked that they always users women recruiters to try to appeal more to candidates. I suspect just coincidence but I noticed it when SpaceX came to me a year ago. That being said, it seems cool but also seems miserable, they have the industry nickname of “SlaveX” for a reason. A different engineer I met at a different internship at a research lab did not return to spacex. \n\nIt’s one summer. I’d skip NG because they’ll take you on afterwards regardless if you did the internship. I’m biased slightly against Anduril/startups long term, but this is a summer where you should take relatively low risk of an internship to prepare yourself to see how good or bad things are when you go full time. SpaceX or Anduril are both great experiences, but yeah spacex will pay less and will have harder work. Both have their risks, and that’s exactly why I’d do either of them as an internship to see if I did want to work there after. I’d do Anduril just because there’s less info on day to day life and because I’d probably rather work there than spacex. That being said, dipping into RFIC can be lucrative (well, at other companies besides spacex), but I’ve heard tape outs are miserable. \n\nI personally wonder if there’s going to be a negative outlook of Musk companies down the road in the industry, but no reason to believe that.\n\n## Comment ID ixgnsw5 with +3 score by [(Chemaid, Reddit, 2022-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/z2ibl0/internship_spacex_starlink_anduril_or_northrop/ixgnsw5/) (in reply to ID z2ibl0):\nHonestly I’d think you get more RF exposure in the RF silicon team at spacex. Anduril is likely using off the shelf components and you’d be integrating components to meet a product spec. The amount of design that entails is more varied compared to working on RF silicon designs. I don’t work at either so this is kinda out of my ass, but I do work in the same industry and closely follow both org’s work.\n\n## Comment ID ixj05lp with +2 score by [(tokage, Reddit, 2022-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/z2ibl0/internship_spacex_starlink_anduril_or_northrop/ixj05lp/) (in reply to ID z2ibl0):\nPersonally I wouldn’t bother with SpaceX Starlink. I’m a seasoned engineer and, on a whim, I interviewed with them not so long ago, and it was the worst experience and biggest waste of time I can remember in my professional career. I had prepped a presentation for them and they were so completely disorganized that they couldn’t get ahold of the people that were supposed to interview me and join the presentation (including the hiring manager), and took forever to repay my travel expenses.

While it's reasonable to appreciate and model after a successful business, it becomes excessive when it feels like every new hire or internal initiative mirrors Palantir. I applied for a position at Anduril with the intention of contributing to and aligning with the unique culture of Anduril.\n\nWhile there are individuals who genuinely embody the values of Anduril, a significant portion seems to adopt Palantir's entire leadership, strategic, and cultural philosophy. While Palantir has undoubtedly achieved noteworthy accomplishments, it's important to note that Palantir is not synonymous with Palmer Luckey.

I know the company will land on it's feet but the tech feel is dwindling on a lot of the projects - Most of management is Palantir adjacent which makes it very difficult to move up in level. There are a few with the mentality of \"train someone for your current position\" which is amazing but most are too overworked to be good managers - Expect work-life balance to be pretty bad for most teams. You'll work hard but learn a lot.",

It seems impossible to attend a meeting or engage in a conversation without Palantir being brought up. While it's reasonable to appreciate and model after a successful business, it becomes excessive when it feels like every new hire or internal initiative mirrors Palantir. I applied for a position at Anduril with the intention of contributing to and aligning with the unique culture of Anduril.\n\nWhile there are individuals who genuinely embody the values of Anduril, a significant portion seems to adopt Palantir's entire leadership, strategic, and cultural philosophy. While Palantir has undoubtedly achieved noteworthy accomplishments, it's important to note that Palantir is not synonymous with Palmer Luckey. If individuals are joining the company solely because of Palmer, they might discover a scenario resembling Palantir 2.0, as opposed to the original vision they may have anticipated.",

      "# [Anduril and Impulse Space to collaborate on AI-driven satellite mobility by Sandra Erwin on 2024-10-12](https://spacenews.com/anduril-and-impulse-space-to-collaborate-on-ai-driven-satellite-mobility/)\nWASHINGTON — The defense tech firm Anduril Industries announced a strategic partnership with California-based startup Impulse Space to develop advanced in-space maneuvering capabilities.\n\nThe companies plan to pursue military and defense contracts for space missions that involve complex orbital maneuvers, Anduril said Oct. 11.\n\nThe collaboration will focus on demonstrating “highly maneuverable space missions,” including military operations in nontraditional orbits that require more sophisticated navigation and agility.\n\nImpulse Space, an emerging player in the field of in-space transportation, is known for its development of orbital transfer vehicles designed to move satellites between various orbits. The startup’s Mira orbital transfer vehicle will be central to the new partnership.\n\nAnduril will integrate its Lattice AI-enabled software platform to operate Impulse’s Mira vehicle, allowing a single operator to control and maneuver multiple spacecraft simultaneously. The partnership will involve Anduril acting as a mission systems integrator, equipping Impulse’s spacecraft with its own payloads as well as those from other partners.

As the war in Ukraine has shown, EW tactics are evolving faster than ever — a cat and mouse game of sensing and dodging, disruption and adaptation, in the spectrum — with updates to EW and threat systems now happening over shorter timelines of weeks, days, or even hours. The next generation of EW systems must enable real-time understanding of the spectrum, and provide rapid delivery of effective countermeasures against known and new threats, across domains and modalities.\n\nThat is precisely what Pulsar does.\n\nPulsar integrates a software-defined radio, graphics processing unit, and additional diverse compute into a compact and powerful capability that enables radio frequency machine learning (RFML) to rapidly identify and adapt to emerging threats at the edge. The system supports a range of capabilities as a multi-mission EW solution, including electronic countermeasures, counter-unmanned systems, electronic support, electronic attack, direction finding, geolocation, and other advanced EW capabilities. Pulsar’s modular form factor can also be adapted and integrated onto ground vehicles (Pulsar-V) or aircraft (Pulsar-A) to support distributed EW operations across multiple domains.\n\nPulsar is a system that is fundamentally unique and superior to all other tactical EW systems currently available. It provides the capability to intelligently and autonomously interrogate a wider range of the electromagnetic spectrum, both for known threats and anomalous events, while reducing the time to deploy new EW effects to a matter of hours and days.\n\n“We’ve been developing our Pulsar family of systems to support operational deployments worldwide, including to combat zones, since 2020,” said Sam El-Akkad, General Manager of RF/EW Systems at Anduril. “Built to survive and win in highly-congested and contested electromagnetic environments, Pulsar enables warfighters to counter state and non-state actors employing EW capabilities integrated with other advanced technological systems operating across the electromagnetic spectrum and cyberspace domain.”\n\nPulsar’s open architecture enables integrations into common and joint EW and command-and-control systems to create a unified network of EW capabilities, providing more comprehensive coverage and coordinated effects across distributed operations. It also provides a software development kit that enables continuous development and integrations with third-party providers and rapid integration of best-of-breed capabilities in order to keep pace with new threats and missions.\n\nPulsar is an agile software-defined EW system that can swiftly adapt to changing threats and mission needs in all domains for dynamic operations of today and tomorrow.",

The Mountain View, California-based firm is helping develop ways to optimize AI and lessen the vast amount of computing power that is currently needed to do that. The new round almost triples the company’s valuation from its Series C in 2021. Founded in 2016, the company has raised $1 billion, per Crunchbase.\n\n3. Abnormal Security, $250M, cybersecurity: Abnormal Security closed a $250 million Series D that now values the San Francisco-based cybersecurity startup at $5.1 billion. The new round was led by Wellington Management. The new valuation is a more than 28% uptick from the $4 billion valuation Abnormal got when it raised a $210 million Series C led by Insight Partners back in May 2022. Founded in 2018, Abnormal looks to stop attacks and find compromised accounts across email and connected applications through leveraging machine learning and AI to understand human behavior. The startup has raised nearly $546 million total, per the company. Abnormal also says it recently surpassed $200 million in annual recurring revenue. After a down 2023, cybersecurity startups are once again seeing the cash. In the second quarter of 2024, cyber startups saw a robust $4.4 billion invested, according to Crunchbase data. The dollar figure represents a 63% increase from Q1, which saw $2.7 billion roll to startups in 173 deals. It was the best quarter for funding in the sector since Q1 2022 and a 144% increase from Q2 2023.\n\n4. Flyr, $225M, travel: Travel startup Flyr raised $225 million in equity and $70 million in debt in a new funding round. The equity portion was led by WestCap and reportedly values the startup at $900 million. The San Francisco-based startup develops software for the travel industry, such as airlines. Founded in 2013, the company has raised $482 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n5. IDRx, $120M, biotech: The big biotech raise this week went to a Plymouth, Massachusetts-based startup.

But broadly, it encompasses a multifaceted effort to deter China by incentivizing and expediting industrial production capacity and the military’s adoption of next-generation warfighting technologies en masse — through replicable processes.\n\nTranches within the first capability focus area — known as Replicator 1.0 — are pushing weapons and assets associated with what Hicks refers to as “all-domain attritable autonomous systems” (ADA2) to counter China’s anti-access/area-denial strategy, by August 2025.\n\nReplicator 2.0, reported first by DefenseScoop last month, will accelerate high-volume production of technologies designed to find and destroy enemy drones.\n\nAlthough not everything is out in the open at this point, DefenseScoop has confirmed that the first two tranches of selections — Replicator 1.1 and 1.2 — include a mix of maritime and aerial drones and counter-drone capabilities that are being prioritized for accelerated production.\n\nAccording to Anduril’s website, Ghost-X is an extended-range uncrewed aerial system that’s “designed to evolve after fielding, aligning to lessons learned from the hardware and software iteration required in contested environments like Ukraine and [U.S. Indo-Pacific Command].”\n\nA company specification sheet states that Ghost-X deploys in minutes from a slim rifle case or tactical soft case during dismounted operations, and can be launched and recovered in confined landing zones. The drones have 80 to 90 minutes of cruise endurance, up to 15 miles operating range, capacity to carry payloads that are 25 pounds or less, and are weatherized for a range of harsh and austere environments.\n\nThey are part of Anduril’s Ghost family of systems that its CEO Palmer Luckey said he originally created to counter China’s increasing pervasiveness across the global drone industry.\n\nVia a press release last month, Anduril announced that Ghost-X was tapped for the Army’s Company Level Small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) Directed Requirement, which is meant to rapidly field “commercial capability to Brigade Combat Teams to inform requirements, doctrine, tactics, training, and maintenance concepts for the Army’s Medium Range Reconnaissance (MRR) program.”\n\nThe company thanked the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit — one of the key organizations driving the execution of Replicator — in that release.\n\nIn response to questions from DefenseScoop, Hicks’ public affairs advisor Eric Pahon said on Thursday: “We have no announcements to make at this time regarding Replicator 1.2 capability selections.”\n\nAn Anduril spokesperson declined to comment or share details on Ghost-X pricing.",
