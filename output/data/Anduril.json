I specialized in aeronautics during undergrad. I have worked in flight sciences departments for major DoD contractors since the mid-2010s. Most recently, I have been a Mechanical Design Engineer with a heavy focus on GD&T, 3D drawings & manufacturability for a more civilian Fortune500 company, yet still had a healthy diet of legacy defense clientele. I say all of that to say that I strongly believe that I am qualified to work in this space & take any opportunity to do so very seriously.\n\nI first came across Area-I about 5 years ago. They reached out to me personally & asked me to apply to some positions, which I did as I was a young engineer still trying to navigate my early career. I never heard anything back from them either way. This really rubbed me the wrong way because time is incredibly valuable & I don’t believe it’s that hard to show courtesy to somebody you began a conversation with. Especially when it comes to employment opportunities.\n\nFast forward to this year, Area-I has now been acquired into the Anduril Industries family of organizations somewhere along the timeline between 2018 & 2023. Almost an identical series of events unfolded; Anduril reached out to me letting me know that Area-I is now a subsidiary & they would like for me to apply for some open positions at their new facility in Atlanta, GA.\n\nI’m thinking this is perfect timing. I’ve been looking to settle down in a role after a couple of years of traveling across the country for different projects & Atlanta is the perfect place for me being that I’m based in the area. I shared all of this with the technical recruiter during my initial phone screening & how I had run across Area-I years ago & never heard anything back. They assured me that Anduril was a new organization & was more attentive to their correspondence. So reluctantly, I applied to a few positions.\n\nThis was all in late January/Early February of this year. Weeks roll by. Months roll by. Didn’t hear anything back.\n\nThen all of a sudden, they’re rushing me into an interview for a Mechanical Engineer position. I accept the interview in mid-April. It went well. Or so I thought.\n\nMy interview was with two engineers who were both several years younger than me, which was surprising considering I’m barely touching 30. One was holding the title of “Mechanical Engineer IV” after only being at the company for 3 years, which I thought was…odd but ok. Didn’t think much of it besides hard work, amazing accomplishments, opportunities for growth & promotion, etc. which is what I had been looking for during my career search.\n\nThey had assembled some screenshots of mechanical drawings, machined pieces & FBDs to “see how I thought about problem-solving” into a virtual whiteboard called Miro.\n\nThey were stumbling over themselves mid-question to constantly reiterate “this isn’t a test. This isn’t a quiz. We just want to see your thought process”.\n\nSo I answered all the questions honestly & thoroughly. I feel like I only struggled with one question that the younger of the two had asked me because it was about designing a camera in the desert to continously track a UAV given the flight parh. Admittedly, I thought this one was odd but unique. Also answered that one honestly to the best of my ability.\n\nBy the end of the technical segment of the interview, which lasted 45 mins, I solved 3 separate FBDs. One considering a U-2 in SLUF, one considering the moment forces acting on the airfoil of the same U-2 & one describing the magnitude of lift forces on a group of airfoils given the internal structures. The older of the two complimented my FBDs at the end of these questions.\n\nThe last 15 mins of the interview was scheduled for open discussion, which I happily used to ask each of them about their respective teams, their journeys to Anduril, as well as how/why this position came open in the first place. You know, doing my due diligence to try to see what I could potentially be walking into.\n\nThe younger one barely answered any of the questions. Just followed the older engineer with typical generic, uninterested responses, e.g., “nothing else to add” or “he said what I was going to say”, which was the first red flag. But again, I didn’t think much of it due to his age. Thinking he couldn’t have much experience/polished interpersonal skills running an interview. That’s a specific skillset, so I give him grace.\n\nFinally, I closed out by thanking each of them for their time & asking specifics about next steps to make sure I wouldn’t have to wait another 2-3 months to hear back from them. They told me the next step is an on-site interview with the team so everyone can get more acquainted & I’d get to see their brand new facility that they just moved into a few months ago. They let me know that this time their *internal* technical recruiter would set it up “within the next two weeks but we don’t want to speak to her pace or workload”.\n\n### Comment ID jkerug6 with +25 score by [(vizualthewanderer, Reddit, 2023-05-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AerospaceEngineering/comments/13jf2g4/my_experience_interviewing_with_anduril_industries/jkerug6/) (in reply to ID jkertnr):\nFast forward to a week later, I get an email from the external technical recruiter that originally screened my application & pushed it through. This was very surprising to me, considering it was way before the “two week” period that I was cited with, it wasn’t the internal member & this member is from a different country. But me trying to be optimistic, I’m thinking they’re just trying to keep striking while the iron is hot. Boy was I in for a rude awakening.\n\nShe tells me the team is no longer considering me for the position. I’m actually taken aback by all of this. She’s been pretty responsive in the past, so I email her back almost immediately about any specific feedback that was given as to how they arrived at this decision.\n\nY’all. She replied back, acknowledging that the team said they had a great conversation with me but when asked about the qualifications she basically said these two guys told her that I lacked detail & understanding on EVERYTHING. Especially my FBDs.\n\nNow, I’m actually really confused by this point. Not only did I answer every question, every follow-up & entertain their “what if” scenarios off script of the given questions. I specifically remember being praised on my FBDs. My confusion & astonishment is now beginning to turn into irritation & anger.\n\nNone of that feedback was given to me during either portion of the interview. Not during the technical, not during the discussion. Before I get too wrapped up in calling them on their bullshit, I remember I had submitted applications for other open positions in flight sciences & systems design divisions. So I politely inquire about the status of those applications because they all were submitted within days of the Mechanical Engineer & I have yet to hear anything back.\n\nShe retorts “that’s not what I’m responsible for but I’ll see if I can check. Best wishes”. Not even a full 24 hours later, I get an email from a new technical recruiter that I’ve never shared correspondence with before, probably external as well. He says they’re not moving forward with **any** of my applications in the entire flight sciences department. Which tells me that a) they’ve been sitting on them for months & never said anything or b) they allowed the feedback from a different team influence their decision to not consider me for any open positions in an entirely different division. \n\nNow I’m starting to feel like I was being lied to, intentionally misled or dealing with a disingenuous situation altogether. I shared that opinion in my last email with her & I hope I never hear back from anybody associated with them ever again. I don’t even care to hear what the Systems Design division has to say at this point.\n\nIn conclusion, Anduril Industries was a horrible experience all the way around. They might’ve absorbed Area-I & other subsidiaries into their brand but they still have the same culture of not knowing what they’re asking for & penalizing others for it.\n\nFair warning to the rest of you. Hope everyone finds success elsewhere. Thanks for taking precious time out of your lives to read this. I, for one, appreciate how valuable that is.\n\n[Link](https://jobs.lever.co/anduril/6d1d3044-f647-4d05-9205-b7fd96cfbab1) to the actual position description.\n\nCheers.\n\n#### Comment ID kdi6izt with +4 score by [(CovertEngineering2, Reddit, 2023-12-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AerospaceEngineering/comments/13jf2g4/my_experience_interviewing_with_anduril_industries/kdi6izt/) (in reply to ID jkerug6):\nI’ve found a lot of people can find ways to discredit those who intimidate them (you are older and answered everything well.

My position was for an Engineer I position and I felt like I had a good experience. \n\n\nI started with a Miro whiteboard interview with a panel of about 4 engineers (all around my age, slightly older). That went pretty well and I felt like clicked with them. Some questions I remember included design considerations for an antenna tracker and airfoil structural supports. Later on, I had my in-person interview. They booked my flight for me and I was reimbursed for all of my Uber rides. I had to do a presentation on a technical project with another panel, and then had a facility tour. It honestly looked like a really fun place to work for in 2021. After my in-person interview, I had another interview with a much older man (some vice president). That interview was mostly cultural and “why do you want to work here.” That went well and I received an offer later. The salary was ~69k with some stock stuff that I don’t remember. In the end I took my only other offer mainly because I wanted to stay in California.\n\n### Comment ID kufsqvm with +1 score by [(farts_wars, Reddit, 2024-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AerospaceEngineering/comments/13jf2g4/my_experience_interviewing_with_anduril_industries/kufsqvm/) (in reply to ID jkh2j4v):\nWhere was this position located if not California?

I would have also been frustrated if they told me to apply and I never heard back, though.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI was asked the same questions during my interview. Based on how you have described your skills and experience, I am also surprised you didn't get an offer. AREA-I really emphasizes cultural fits during the interview process. I have heard of similarly qualified candidates being turned down because they wouldn't fit the company culture. Since your other applications were turned down quickly after your first interview, my hunch is that they didn't think you'd be a good character fit. That being said, that's not consistent with what they said about you \"lacking detail and understanding\". It could be a little of both. Maybe you didn't answer as well as you think you did.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThe \"stumbling over themselves to reiterate that it wasn't a test\" bit may have been because they thought you were nervous or they didn't like your answers?

The *palantíri* do let you see things from afar, as the name literally means, and Palantir the company does focus on data analytics to at least theoretically get a good picture of what's happening on the ground. Also by the Third Age, *palantíri* are strongly associated with villains doing villlanous spying on the noble realms of men, even if they weren't originally created that way.

Thiel hires bright eyed interns from the top tech schools then has them code up whatever the heck the customer will pay for.

We try the person wielding the knife. \n\nIgnoring that for a moment, there's no actual evidence Glamdring delivers the killing blow to Durin's Bane. The evidence suggests that it's the fall that kills it. Glamdring is also only one of Gandalf's three weapons in that fight (the sword, the staff, and the magic). Sting also doesn't kill Shelob; if Tolkien wanted to indicate that she died, he would have been more explicit. We don't assume that the Watcher in the Water was killed, so we shouldn't assume Shelob was killed. As for the other weapons mentioned? They're not exactly legendary weapons. They're just well-made weapons. They're not magical.\n\nAragorn's strengths don't come from his ability to wield a sword (though he's very good at it). They come from other things. His ability to survive in the wild, to track the Hobbits, to invoke an ancient oath and bind the Army of the Dead, to convince the Rohirrim and later Gondorians to support him as Isildur's Heir, and his absolute fearlessness in facing down the worst the enemy has to offer in the hopes of giving Frodo time to destroy the Ring.

It legitimises Aragorn's claim to the throne. It also rallies people to his cause. The soldiers of the fiefs of Gondor would not have followed any random person to Minas Tirith. They follow Aragorn because he claims to be Isildur's heir. And this claim is backed up because he carries Elendil's sword \n\nPlus the most important thing Anduril does is scare the everloving s**t out of Sauron. He launches his attack on Minas Tirith prematurely because Aragorn shows him the sword of Elendil in the palantir of isengard. This allows Frodo to sneak into Mordor via Cirth Ungol and also leads to a victory on the Pelennor fields. \n\nLater when the heir of Elendil marches to Mordor, he emptied his land to face him. This again enables Frodo to reach Mount Doom without being detected. So the sword is a symbol. It encourages and rallies the free people and scares the enemies. That is much better than just being a weapon that is good at killing. Also since it was first made in Numenor and then reforged by the Noldor, it is also very good at killing.\n\n## Comment ID k6nbom2 with +5 score by [(j1h15233, Reddit, 2023-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/17hf1sr/anduril_is_the_least_impressive_weapon_of_the/k6nbom2/) (in reply to ID 17hf1sr):\nSo the least impressive weapon is the one that summons an army of the dead?

Anduril, Flame of the West was proof that Aragorn was the heir of Isildur. It was also an inspiration to those who fought alongside him. Narsil was extremely sharp and strong, forged by the dwarven smith Telchar “in the deeps of time,” and was stated to be even stronger when it was reforged as Anduril. It had a red hue during battle and cleaved iron and flesh “as it were green wood” just like Angrist, the other blade forged by Telchar, which cut a Silmaril from the iron crown of Morgoth. There is a paragraph in LotR describing how, with a flash like a flame, Anduril was brought down on an orc and cleaved both helmet and head in two. Also, there is that whole thing with “death shall come to any who wield it save Elendil’s heir.” And this isn’t really the sword itself, but the sheath Aragorn keeps it in was given to him by Galadriel, who said the sword kept in that sheath will not break in victory or defeat.\n\nEdit: Telchar was a dwarf, not an elf\n\n### Comment ID k6oiqrc with +2 score by [(tappthis, Reddit, 2023-10-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/17hf1sr/anduril_is_the_least_impressive_weapon_of_the/k6oiqrc/) (in reply to ID k6oe8mt):\nWrong, it wasnt isildur's sword.

This is a unique opportunity to use Haskell to implement high performance applications in an embedded setting. Anduril has adopted Nix at large and we use IOG's generously maintained Haskell.nix project to build all of our Haskell code and ship it to thousands of customer assets across the globe. If you have Haskell experience and are interested in any of:\n\n- Software defined radios\n\n- Digital signal processing\n\n- Numerical computing\n\n- FPGAs\n\n- Linux drivers/systems programming\n\n- Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS\n\n- Dhall\n\n  \nplease do drop me a line at [travis@anduril.com](mailto:travis@anduril.com), and please also submit your application to our online portal here: [https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/andurilindustries/jobs/4460811007?gh\\_jid=4460811007](https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/andurilindustries/jobs/4460811007?gh_jid=4460811007)\n\nTo tackle a few common questions:\n\n- Yes, Anduril is an American defense technology company. We build weapons systems for the United States and its allies.\n\n- This is a \\_Haskell\\_ role. It is not a bait and switch. We are writing applications in GHC Haskell, not some homegrown Haskell-like language or some other programming language. That said, knowledge of C, Rust, or Typescript would be a valuable differentiating factor, as we often rub elbows with codebases that use these languages as well.\n\n- This is an on-site role at Anduril headquarters in Costa Mesa, California. Our team is building software for hardware products, so physical presence in our RF lab is often required throughout the course of software development and testing. Remote work would only be considered for candidates with something extraordinary to offer to our team.\n\n  \nI'd be happy to answer any other questions in the thread below.\n\n## Comment ID lk9vejf with +12 score by [(MasalDosa69, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1f2x743/anduril_industries_electromagnetic_warfare_team/lk9vejf/) (in reply to ID 1f2x743):\nDo you require citizenship?\n\n### Comment ID lkcwgfy with +4 score by [(mjuad, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1f2x743/anduril_industries_electromagnetic_warfare_team/lkcwgfy/) (in reply to ID lk9vejf):\nThey require a TS/SCI clearance, which implies citizenship.\n\n### Comment ID lkcxpe2 with +4 score by [(develop7, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1f2x743/anduril_industries_electromagnetic_warfare_team/lkcxpe2/) (in reply to ID lk9vejf):\nQuoth https://www.state.gov/security-clearance-faqs/:\n\n> *Do I have to be a U.S. citizen to receive a security clearance from the Department of State?*\n> \n> Yes.

In the industry, SpaceX is known but doesn't really have a good reputation. Anduril is a newer company but they just won a billion dollar contract for SOCOM so trust me they are known. Employers evaluate your technical skills and achievements regardless of where they come from. Seeing SpaceX on your resume just means you've endured a toxic work environment. We live in a capitaistic society so your labor should go to the highest bidder. SpaceX isn't some sort of noble pursuit. They are looking to overwork and underpay you, and they are hoping the myth perpetuated by Elon and his fandom will drive you to sacrifice your personal life so they can get some cheap labor. You have to remember that working overtime as a salaried employee means you are actually making less money because the amount they pay you doesn't change so avoid it as much as possible. You will grow and learn at Anduril and you will be well compensated for it. Easy decision imo.\n\n### Comment ID ixheexs with +14 score by [(kalenxy, Reddit, 2022-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/z2ibl0/internship_spacex_starlink_anduril_or_northrop/ixheexs/) (in reply to ID ixgnde8):\nI'm not disagreeing with you in any way, you are spot on.

They had decent pay for your position, but it’s also easy to get bored at places like NG. It’s also easy to have a steady work life balance. \n\nSpacex would be the opposite. I had a Comintern at NG from SpaceX and he joked that they always users women recruiters to try to appeal more to candidates. I suspect just coincidence but I noticed it when SpaceX came to me a year ago. That being said, it seems cool but also seems miserable, they have the industry nickname of “SlaveX” for a reason. A different engineer I met at a different internship at a research lab did not return to spacex. \n\nIt’s one summer. I’d skip NG because they’ll take you on afterwards regardless if you did the internship. I’m biased slightly against Anduril/startups long term, but this is a summer where you should take relatively low risk of an internship to prepare yourself to see how good or bad things are when you go full time. SpaceX or Anduril are both great experiences, but yeah spacex will pay less and will have harder work. Both have their risks, and that’s exactly why I’d do either of them as an internship to see if I did want to work there after. I’d do Anduril just because there’s less info on day to day life and because I’d probably rather work there than spacex. That being said, dipping into RFIC can be lucrative (well, at other companies besides spacex), but I’ve heard tape outs are miserable. \n\nI personally wonder if there’s going to be a negative outlook of Musk companies down the road in the industry, but no reason to believe that.\n\n## Comment ID ixgnsw5 with +3 score by [(Chemaid, Reddit, 2022-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/z2ibl0/internship_spacex_starlink_anduril_or_northrop/ixgnsw5/) (in reply to ID z2ibl0):\nHonestly I’d think you get more RF exposure in the RF silicon team at spacex.

If the voltage was off I corrected this using the voltage correction steps as close as I could get it. \n\n2. For temperature, and this may be a dumb question so excuse my noobness, how do you measure the temperature in order to calibrate this? So you use a temperature gun pointed at the head of the light? Do you use ambient temperature using a room temperature sensor kind of thing? How do you measure the temperature prior to correcting this on the light? \n\nLastly regarding thermal ceiling is there any chart or post regarding what thermals are good for what Hank hosts? \n\nThanks for your always great and informative comments!\n\n#### Comment ID l52bmtx with +2 score by [(IAmJerv, Reddit, 2024-05-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/1cvuurx/what_are_your_firstfavorite_anduril_20/l52bmtx/) (in reply to ID l51pp02):\nYou got the voltage right. \n\nAs for temperature, what I do is let the light sit idle for a bit so that it's the same temperature as the digital cooking thermometer I have nearby. Well, if I'm feeling fussy. My living room is generally 22C.\n\nThere's no chart that I know of as it's partly based on personal preference. I generally set any light small enough to EDC for 55C and larger lights like my M44 or K9.3 to 60C. That gives it a gentler rampdown but the battery tube won't get too hot to handle. It's generally cooler than the rest of the light, and the lower-than-maximum ceiling keeps the rate of heat buildup on Turbo just slow enough to ramp down manually if you keep it on long enough to get uncomfortable instead of being insta-scorch.\n\n## Comment ID l4s3ek4 with +4 score by [(Marcoos, Reddit, 2024-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/1cvuurx/what_are_your_firstfavorite_anduril_20/l4s3ek4/) (in reply to ID 1cvuurx):\n**Features I don't enjoy:**\n\n• Ramp from moonlight disabled\n\n• Smooth steps disabled\n\n• Post-off voltage display disabled\n\n.\n\n**Levels and ramping:**\n\n• Smooth ramping with floor/ceiling 10/120, default speed\n\n• Manual memory 60 for small lights (D4V2/D3AA), 80 for big lights (DM11/D4SV2/D4K/D1K)\n\n• Simple UI floor/ceiling 60/60 for small lights, 80/80 for big lights, 1 step, no turbo.

The tables linked in here are better, but it's still not great.\n\nAt a certain point, demanding that all functionality, no matter how complex or numerous, be addressed by just button clicks stops being the best way to do things when there are viable alternatives. \n\nAny flashlight that has a USB port should allow writing configs to the flashlight and skipping all the button pressing. \n\nAny flashlight that can be set by button clicking can have an adapter for hooking into the on / off circuit that would allow updating all these options without the manual labor.\n\nBluetooth and wifi chips with antennas built in are getting smaller every year and integrating one or the other going forward is a better alternative for manufacturers serving enthusiasts.\n\nAnd to preempt any \"So do it yourself!\" or \"How many PCBs have you designed?\" nonsense replies, you don't have to be a chef to know when the food you're eating isn't great. \n\nManufacturers want to give you what you want.

People say it is too complicated but rather I think it is like being able to make your torch function the way you want to without thinking \"I wish my light can do this\", because with Anduril, you have less opportunity cost options to deal with.\n\nI think really the main point of Anduril is its \"set and forget\" feature. It has a lot of options, but it doesn't mean you need to click it a lot of times every time. Once you set it up the way you like, it is good to go and you don't have to switch to set modes too.\n\nAlso, you can download the eeprom as well, meaning you can save your options settings and potentially transfer it to other Anduril lights with the same features and firmware build.\n\n## Comment ID kb3j1xn with +1 score by [(Geromegoons, Reddit, 2023-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kb3j1xn/) (in reply to ID 185cxre):\nRidiculous.\n\nI enjoy tinkering and nerding out over things like torches but when I see this my honest reaction is \"I'm not reading that\".\n\nIs there not a way we just plug the torch in to a USB port on a PC and config it with a small program?

I'm scared.\n\n### Comment ID kbpgqgt with +3 score by [(ToyKeeper, Reddit, 2023-12-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kbpgqgt/) (in reply to ID kbiw7vh):\nThe diagram makes it look scary, but it's not.  It's basically just \"click for on/off, hold to change brightness\", and then there are a bunch of optional things available for people who want them.  [The manual](https://github.com/ToyKeeper/anduril/blob/trunk/docs/anduril-manual.md) has the details in a form which is hopefully not so intimidating.  Most of the features are disabled by default, and only accessible after switching to advanced mode... so by default, it just acts like a pretty normal flashlight.\n\n## Comment ID kcoh1cw with +1 score by [(Practical_Self3090, Reddit, 2023-12-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kcoh1cw/) (in reply to ID 185cxre):\nThis gave me flashbacks to studying [metabolic pathways](https://curtiswrightmaps.com/wp-content/uploads/map_03-30-20_300dpi_12.42x19.09_inv830.1-scaled.jpg) diagrams in biology class XD"

On that note, tech leadership positions are just appointments, they don't hold interviews for anyone else who may be qualified or interested. Management doesn't really seem to have much interest in developing their employees professionally. Annual review structure is disorganized at best and raises are very small (less than 2% raise each year even with a stellar review). Have to work 3-4 hours of overtime every day to even make a decent living to survive. All funding is essentially saved for the army of software engineers they hire and fire every quarter. On a weekly basis I have one or another newly graduated engineer attempt to tell me how to do my job (with over a decade of tech experience). The last several years have been nothing short of an extremely frustrating experience and huge letdown from what was promised when I quit my previous job and came here.

If you're not \"one of the boys\", you'll be excluded from meetings and important decisions.\nNo solid leadership - flat hierarchy results in no clear direction or goal. \nNo training.\nNo consistency - every team uses its own program management and issue tracking software. And PM/TPM means something different on every team. \nThe products don't actually work. What we're selling doesn't match what we actually have built.\nTesting is a nice-to-have, which won't scale for large UAVs.\n\nA good chunk of these positive reviews come from an all-hands where poor interview practices/feedback was brought up and the solution was telling employees to flood Glassdoor with positive reviews vs fixing practices.",

It seems impossible to attend a meeting or engage in a conversation without Palantir being brought up. While it's reasonable to appreciate and model after a successful business, it becomes excessive when it feels like every new hire or internal initiative mirrors Palantir. I applied for a position at Anduril with the intention of contributing to and aligning with the unique culture of Anduril.\n\nWhile there are individuals who genuinely embody the values of Anduril, a significant portion seems to adopt Palantir's entire leadership, strategic, and cultural philosophy. While Palantir has undoubtedly achieved noteworthy accomplishments, it's important to note that Palantir is not synonymous with Palmer Luckey. If individuals are joining the company solely because of Palmer, they might discover a scenario resembling Palantir 2.0, as opposed to the original vision they may have anticipated.",

Management doesn't really seem to have much interest in developing their employees professionally. Annual review structure is disorganized at best and raises are very small (less than 2% raise each year even with a stellar review). Have to work 3-4 hours of overtime every day to even make a decent living to survive. All funding is essentially saved for the army of software engineers they hire and fire every quarter. On a weekly basis I have one or another newly graduated engineer attempt to tell me how to do my job (with over a decade of tech experience).

      "# [Anduril lands $250 million Pentagon contract for drone defense system by Courtney Albon on 2024-10-08](https://www.defensenews.com/unmanned/2024/10/08/anduril-lands-250-million-pentagon-contract-for-drone-defense-system/)\nThe Pentagon awarded Anduril Industries a contract worth $250 million to counter drone attacks against U.S. forces with the company’s recoverable Roadrunner interceptor.\n\nUnder the deal, which Anduril announced on Tuesday, the Defense Department will buy 500 Roadrunner all-up rounds as well as the firm’s portable Pulsar electronic-warfare capability, which can be integrated with aircraft to jam enemy systems.\n\n“This latest contract award highlights Anduril’s commitment to investing its own research and development to support defense innovation, providing rapid, scalable solutions to safeguard U.S. forces,” the company said in a statement.\n\nAn Anduril spokesperson declined to name the firm’s DOD customer due to security concerns, but the company said the contract will serve multiple military services in “priority regions where U.S. forces face significant threats” from drones. Deliveries will begin this year and continue through the end of 2025.\n\nThe firm is already on a 10-year, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract worth up to $1 billion with U.S. Special Operations Command to supply counter-drone hardware and software, but the spokesperson would not confirm whether the new business is part of its SOCOM award.\n\nThat deal was announced in January 2022 and later that year, the command awarded Anduril $12.5 million for Roadrunner. SOCOM also requested another $19 million for the technology in its fiscal 2024 budget request.\n\nAnduril unveiled Roadrunner last December after spending two years secretly developing it with internal funding. At the time, the company’s founder Palmer Luckey told reporters that Roadrunner was in low-rate production with an initial U.S. customer for “hundreds of units.” He said the company plans to quickly scale to quantities in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nThe use of drones and loitering munitions on the battlefield has expanded in recent years. The department wants to learn from the ingenuity of the Ukrainian military, which has deployed small drones in response to Russia’s onslaught, but it also wants to develop a strong defense against the use of hostile drones by adversaries like Iran and its proxies.\n\nThe Pentagon created the Joint Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office to develop a coordinated, long-term response to drone threats in 2019, and in 2023, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks revealed a new DoD initiative called Replicator to field thousands of autonomous systems by next summer.\n\nThe department announced last week that Replicator’s next area of focus will be Counter-UAS.\n\nAccording to Anduril, Roadrunner offers a solution for both sides of the challenge. Chris Brose, the company’s chief of strategy, told reporters last December the system — which can carry a variety of payloads — was built to adapt as DOD’s needs change.\n\n“We’re very hopeful that the government will see in this capability what we see in it, which is a novel solution that is built to be adaptable to where those threats are going in the near future — which, by the way, has been a process that’s been playing out over the past few years, and it’s just going to get worse,” he said.\n\nCourtney Albon is C4ISRNET’s space and emerging technology reporter.

      "# [Anduril to open software-based manufacturing hub to scale production by Courtney Albon on 2024-08-08](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2024/08/08/anduril-to-open-software-based-manufacturing-hub-to-scale-production/)\nAs the Pentagon makes a push toward scaling production of autonomous systems and weapons, Anduril Industries is accelerating its own manufacturing capabilities through a new software-based production hub called Arsenal.\n\nThe California-based defense technology company announced Wednesday it will build the first Arsenal facility in the U.S., using funding from a recent $1.5 billion Series F investment round. Chris Brose, Anduril’s chief strategy officer, told reporters the firm’s goal is to consolidate manufacturing in order to “hyperscale” production across its product lines, including uncrewed combat drones and autonomous underwater vehicles.\n\n“When we say hyperscale, we mean the ability to produce tens of thousands of a given system,” he said in a briefing. “This is the target that we’re setting for ourselves right now.”\n\nThe company hasn’t identified a location for the first Arsenal facility, but it will join the company’s growing footprint of manufacturing hubs spread across the United States. Brose noted that the firm wants to quickly replicate Arsenal’s capabilities in other regions and may consider basing plants overseas, in proximity to key U.S. partners.\n\nUnderlying Anduril’s development of Arsenal, and of much of Anduril’s approach to defense innovation, is the belief that the U.S. and its allies aren’t producing enough of the weapons and vehicles they need to counter threats from major adversaries. Russia’s war in Ukraine has highlighted this challenge, as the U.S. has struggled to replenish its munitions stocks after supplying weapons to Kiev.\n\nThat problem, according to Brose, will only grow in a future conflict with China.\n\nAnduril’s announcement comes as the Pentagon works to scale production of key defense systems, including munitions and unmanned aircraft, vessels and land vehicles.\n\nThe Defense Department’s Replicator effort — which aims to field thousands of low-cost drones by next summer — is perhaps the most high-profile of these programs, but there are other examples within the services, including the Air Force’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft effort, or CCA.\n\nAnduril is involved in several of these efforts in the U.S. and abroad. The firm is one of two vendors building aircraft for the first increment of CCA and is reportedly providing counter-drone technology for Replicator through a system called Wide-Area Infrared System for Persistent Surveillance. This spring, the company announced a partnership with Australia’s Defence Force to co-develop the Ghost Shark extra-large autonomous underwater vehicle.\n\nBrose said what differentiates Arsenal from other manufacturing approaches is its software backbone, powered by the company’s Lattice autonomy platform. The system uses common resource planning and execution systems that allow it to integrate threat simulations, testing, data management and other functions.\n\n“This is very different than how traditional defense production is, where software is broken up across lots of different subcomponents and Balkanized across the platform,” he said. “What Lattice gives us is the ability to start with a mature software platform, and then build modular producible weapons from it, where we can control how all of the different subsystems interface into the overall platform.”\n\nArsenal will also rely heavily on commercial industry, leveraging dual-use technology and components wherever possible. This approach is already a big part of Anduril’s philosophy, as about 90% of its products use commercially available components and materials to reduce timelines and save on production costs.\n\nThe intent, Brose said, is to draw lessons — and in some cases personnel — from successful commercial leaders in the automotive or consumer electronic industries.\n\n“We’re taking many of the people who lead those processes at some of these world-leading commercial companies that have achieved this type of hyperscale production before and we’re bringing this into the defense industrial base to fundamentally transform how we build weapons, how we design weapons,” he said.\n\nCourtney Albon is C4ISRNET’s space and emerging technology reporter.

      "# [Pentagon tech hub hires Anduril to get large underwater drone to Navy by Megan Eckstein on 2024-02-08](https://www.defensenews.com/unmanned/2024/02/08/pentagon-tech-hub-hires-anduril-to-get-large-underwater-drone-to-navy/)\nThe Defense Innovation Unit awarded Anduril Industries a contract that will get its Dive family of large-diameter autonomous underwater vehicles into the hands of sailors for operations this year.\n\nThe award comes after DIU selected the Dive-LD platform to perform in a “swim-off” last year that put commercially available large unmanned underwater vehicles through an obstacle course to assess their maturity and applicability to conduct “distributed, long-range, persistent underwater sensing and payload delivery in contested environment,” according to a Feb. 8 Anduril news release.\n\nDIU is the Pentagon’s commercial innovation hub.\n\nAnduril said the U.S. Navy selected it for a follow-on contract that allows operational units to borrow the unmanned vehicles for experiments or buy them as a routine tool for their missions. The company could not disclose information about the value or duration of the contract, which was awarded through DIU’s Commercial Solutions Opening process.\n\nAnduril’s chief strategy officer, Chris Brose, told Defense News the company had worked on maturing and demonstrating the Dive-LD vehicle for the last two years, but the contract now provides a mechanism to get the drone into the hands of sailors across varied geographies and unit types so they can “start solving a lot of different problems across the seabed and undersea domain.”\n\nThe contract creates direct access between Anduril and operators. A unit that has never worked with an autonomous underwater vehicle may want to experiment with one for a couple weeks or months, while another unit with a more refined concept for how they’d use the Dive-LD vehicle may want to buy several right off the bat.\n\nBrose said the contract allows for whatever the operators prefer, as well as payload integration and other engineering to get the units a tailor-made system to meet their specific needs.\n\nThe Navy has struggled to bring large unmanned underwater vehicles to the fleet.\n\nIt kicked off a Snakehead large-diameter unmanned underwater vehicle program in 2017, though the original research program dates to before 2015. The first Snakehead prototype wasn’t christened until 2022, and the Navy and Congress agreed to cancel the program later that year. However, it’s been somewhat resurrected as a market research effort to identify commercially available technology that could be useful to the fleet.\n\nThe Navy also pursued an Orca extra-large UUV program, first selecting Boeing as one of two companies for a 2017 design contract and then selecting the firm as the sole winner of a 2019 contract to build four prototypes. The program has seen developmental and manufacturing delays. The company in December delivered a pre-prototype test asset but has not yet completed and delivered any of the prototypes on contract.\n\nBrose said the Dive-LD — which Anduril acquired in early 2022 when it bought Dive Technologies ­— was designed for manufacturability, payload integration and artificial intelligence-powered smart operations.\n\nThe vehicle is made using advanced manufacturing processes, and the outer shell is 3D printed. Brose said this means the company can scale up production to meet demand under this DIU contract and others that may follow.\n\nHe referred to this DIU effort as a “breakthrough opportunity” that’s led to Anduril “really beginning to invest and facilitize for larger-scale production, which is something we’re doing in other parts of the business.”\n\nHe could not speculate how many Dive-LD vehicles the company might build for Defense Department customers under this DIU contract, but he called it “a really significant next step” for the company.\n\nBecause of the advanced manufacturing processes, Anduril can easily redesign pieces of the modular unmanned vehicle to accommodate a payload, reshape or resize the whole vehicle to fit a certain need, and more, based on what customers want.\n\n“I think the excitement for us is the ability to really start doing the things at scale that the vehicle was designed to do,” he said.\n\nIn addition to this contract with DIU, Anduril signed a three-year agreement with Australia in 2022 to create something akin to an Orca XLUUV. The company, the Royal Australian Navy, and the Australian government’s Defence Science and Technology Group — in a $100 million co-funding effort — will design, develop and manufacture the extra-large autonomous undersea vehicles.\n\nMegan Eckstein is the naval warfare reporter at Defense News.

Fresh off the introduction of next-generation drones and autonomous cruise missiles for the U.S. Air Force, the company announced plans to design, build, and launch its own fully integrated space systems by the end of 2025.\n\n“We are expanding our advanced, AI-powered hardware and software capabilities into the final frontier: space,” Gokul Subramanian, Anduril’s senior vice president of space engineering, said Sept. 13 in a news release. The company intends to develop spacecraft for applications like space domain awareness, on-orbit sensor data processing, and satellite defense.\n\nPlans to test payloads\n\nThe space mission planned for 2025, according to Subramanian, will act as a testbed for Anduril and third-party payloads, with further details to be revealed in the coming months.\n\nAnduril’s expansion into space builds on the company’s broader strategy of developing autonomous systems that require minimal human intervention. The company developed a “Collaborative Combat Aircraft,” an autonomous system designed to operate alongside U.S. Air Force piloted aircraft. And it recently announced plans to mass-produce air-breathing, autonomous cruise missiles using commercially available components.\n\nCentral to Anduril’s technology is its Lattice software, which integrates various sensors and systems for real-time decision-making. Subramanian said Lattice will be used “to autonomously monitor and manage space-based assets, improving situational awareness and reducing operator workload.”\n\nComputer vision tech\n\nThe software’s computer vision technology, which processes and interprets visual data from cameras and other imaging systems, allows for real-time object identification and classification, the company said. This technology, crucial for autonomous decision-making in drone operations, could be applied to satellites in orbit so operators on the ground can respond to threats faster.\n\nAnduril’s expansion into space builds upon its previous work with the Space Surveillance Network (SSN), operated by the U.S. Space Force. The company has won contracts to leverage its Lattice platform to manage data from this global network of sensors, which is designed to detect and identify objects in orbit. The company said the integration of Lattice with the SSN has transformed the legacy communication system into a modern mesh network, providing a more comprehensive operational picture of the space environment.",

Rhodes Jr, Eleanor Pringle on 2024-09-06](https://fortune.com/2024/09/06/defense-tech-startup-anduril-hiring-manufacturing-capacity-us-air-force-fighter-jets/)\nIn an onstage interview with Fortune on Wednesday, Anduril Executive Chairman Trae Stephens revealed that the defense company’s headcount is now over 3,500 people—nearly 46% larger than the headcount it reported at the end of December.\n\n“It’s big in startup standards,” Stephens said of Anduril’s size at the Roadrunner Technology Forum in Albuquerque. “It’s very small when you compare to our competition, which are really the big five primes,” he said, referring to the defense industry incumbents Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman.\n\nAnduril, which was founded in 2017 by Stephens and several other entrepreneurs including Oculus VR headset creator Palmer Luckey, announced last month that it had raised a whopping $1.5 billion in capital. The funding valued Anduril at $14 billion, up from the $8.5 billion valuation Anduril fetched during a 2022 funding round.\n\nStephens said in the interview that Anduril’s cash position could have lasted the company until the end of 2025, but said that the company raised the capital to prepare for fighter jet manufacturing as well as build the “relationships that we need” to start preparing for an eventual IPO. (Anduril added public market investors like Fidelity and Bailie Gifford to its cap table for the first time in its August funding round.)\n\nIn April, the Air Force selected Anduril and surveillance aircraft company General Atomics over Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman to design, manufacture, and test unmanned fighter jets that could be implemented into the Air Force fleet. Stephens said on stage that while the timeline will be up to the Pentagon, Anduril needs to “be ready to build hundreds in a couple of years.”\n\nWhile Stephens says that all of Anduril’s products rely on the same underlying autonomous technology, the company needs to invest a lot of capital into the hardware for these jets. “We’re building fighter planes, and so that means everything from propulsion systems to avionics to sensor payloads and so forth,” he said. “So there’s a big manufacturing assembly component there that will require a lot of capital expenditures and a deep labor pool to be able to scale that over time.”\n\nAnduril has said it expects its new manufacturing facility to be approximately 5 million square feet and to eventually produce “tens of thousands of autonomous military systems annually.” The company has yet to select a specific location for the facility.",

Already, 42 companies have joined the supply chain, and “this will increase as the programme scales,” a company spokesperson explained.\n\nAnduril Australia will construct a local manufacturing facility too, though it declined to share with Naval News its location. However, the Sydney-headquartered firm did say, “We’re planning to have the capability to manufacture extra-large AUVs at scale in Australia.”\n\nThe first production vessel for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) should roll out before the end of 2025.\n\nEach party had previously poured in A$70 million (US$46.1 million) via an incentive contract to develop and build three Ghost Shark prototypes. The first vessel was unveiled on 18 April, a year ahead of schedule, while the third should be delivered by mid-2025.\n\nThe boxy, black-coloured Ghost Shark is based on Anduril’s 2.72-tonne and 5.8m-long Dive-LD submersible, this design inherited after Anduril acquired Dive Technologies in 2022. The Dive-LD can stay submerged for ten days and dive to 6,000m. Anduril is also supplying the type to the US Navy after winning a competition last year.\n\nAnduril Australia declined to provide Ghost Shark specifications because of sensitivities. Nonetheless, the company did say “Ghost Shark’s real capability advancement is in payload flexibility and autonomy to unlock new missions currently unexplored in the subsea domain – both for defence and commercial-use cases”.\n\nDefence ambiguously said the XL-AUV would offer a “cost-effective, persistent intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and strike undersea capability,” though the RAN has not disclosed what sensor and weapon payloads are being considered.\n\n“The Ghost Shark programme will provide a long-range autonomous capability that can perform advanced intelligence, surveillance reconnaissance and targeting operations, providing significant potential for asymmetric advantage in high-risk environments. Ghost Shark will provide stealth, disruptive mass and persistence, optimised for the Indo-Pacific archipelagic environment.”\n\nAnduril Australia\n\nFurthermore, the company explained that these XL-AUVs can descend deeper than any manned submarine. They can perform many of the dull, dirty and dangerous missions traditionally done by crewed platforms, and also fulfil other missions deemed too risky for manned vessels.\n\nThere is no indication either as to how many Ghost Sharks Australia intends to procure, nor where they will be based, or how they will interoperate with existing RAN platforms.\n\nGhost Sharks can carry various payloads required by the RAN, plus its Lattice artificial intelligence-powered operating system allows it to communicate with other crewed and uncrewed platforms.\n\nIts energy system is an evolution of that on the Dive-LD, permitting even longer missions than the latter’s 313nm range, the company said. The spokesperson added, “The XL-AUV will include ground-breaking collaborative autonomy capabilities enabled by Lattice. This level of sophistication is not seen in current autonomous undersea capabilities.”\n\nThe Ghost Shark was co-designed by Anduril, the RAN and Defence Science and Technology Group. The effort is being supported by the Advanced Strategic Capabilities Accelerator (ASCA), with the XL-AUV representing the innovation-promoting organisation’s first mission after it stood up in July 2023.\n\nChief Defence Scientist Professor Tanya Monro said, “Ghost Shark has been specifically designed for manufacturability, mass production and flexibility to create supply chain resilience.”\n\nAnduril Australia’s spokesperson pointed out, “The marginal cost of Ghost Shark compared to traditional platforms, and the fact that it’s uncrewed, means that the XL-AUV can be ‘attritable’ in wartime. Its purpose is to go into harm’s way, to places and at times when there’s low appetite to risk human life, but where it will provide an asymmetric challenge to adversaries that will be difficult to address.”\n\nThe spokesperson added, “The Ghost Shark’s design will adapt rapidly as threats change. This is enabled by having highly skilled Australian engineers close to the manufacturing base in Australia. Anduril Australia has been working with a local supplier network across Australia to plan for manufacturing at scale.”\n\nThe new plant will also manufacture Ghost Sharks for international partners, plus a commercial variant. “The goal is not just to build these vehicles for the Royal Australian Navy, but also to build them for our allied export partners – countries like the US, UK, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, as well as those in Europe. This is, of course, subject to Australian export regulations, and we’re working with Defence’s export control office to ensure we comply with requirements.”\n\nDepending on how they are employed, these XL-AUVs could be a useful force multiplier for the RAN’s underwater capabilities. The navy must rely on a backbone of six ageing Collins-class submarines for many years to come.\n\n– End –",

As the war in Ukraine has shown, EW tactics are evolving faster than ever — a cat and mouse game of sensing and dodging, disruption and adaptation, in the spectrum — with updates to EW and threat systems now happening over shorter timelines of weeks, days, or even hours. The next generation of EW systems must enable real-time understanding of the spectrum, and provide rapid delivery of effective countermeasures against known and new threats, across domains and modalities.\n\nThat is precisely what Pulsar does.\n\nPulsar integrates a software-defined radio, graphics processing unit, and additional diverse compute into a compact and powerful capability that enables radio frequency machine learning (RFML) to rapidly identify and adapt to emerging threats at the edge. The system supports a range of capabilities as a multi-mission EW solution, including electronic countermeasures, counter-unmanned systems, electronic support, electronic attack, direction finding, geolocation, and other advanced EW capabilities. Pulsar’s modular form factor can also be adapted and integrated onto ground vehicles (Pulsar-V) or aircraft (Pulsar-A) to support distributed EW operations across multiple domains.\n\nPulsar is a system that is fundamentally unique and superior to all other tactical EW systems currently available. It provides the capability to intelligently and autonomously interrogate a wider range of the electromagnetic spectrum, both for known threats and anomalous events, while reducing the time to deploy new EW effects to a matter of hours and days.\n\n“We’ve been developing our Pulsar family of systems to support operational deployments worldwide, including to combat zones, since 2020,” said Sam El-Akkad, General Manager of RF/EW Systems at Anduril. “Built to survive and win in highly-congested and contested electromagnetic environments, Pulsar enables warfighters to counter state and non-state actors employing EW capabilities integrated with other advanced technological systems operating across the electromagnetic spectrum and cyberspace domain.”",

A version of the company’s Gambit family of aircraft that General Atomics has said will form the basis of its CCA offering, the XQ-67 flew its first flight in February as part of the Air Force’s Off Board Sensing Station program, which is helping to prove out technologies associated with drone wingmen.\n\nAnduril has said it is pitching its Fury drone for the CCA program.\n\nUnder their contracts, both General Atomics and Anduril will build prototype CCAs, which are set to fly next year. The Air Force will then determine in 2026 whether to start production of the drones developed by either or both of the vendors — or to potentially purchase CCAs from one of the companies previously eliminated from the program.\n\nThe Air Force has said it could buy upwards of a thousand CCAs over the course of the program, potentially buying multiple drone variants from different manufacturers to accomplish various missions.\n\nRELATED: Air Force requests more money for drone wingmen effort\n\nThe service plans to spend “several billion dollars” on CCAs over the next five years, Kendall said, adding that the investment is indicative of the “enormous opportunities” the Air Force sees in incorporating autonomy and artificial intelligence, including technologies associated with machine learning, data analytics, pattern recognition and generative AI.\n\n“Whether it’s just to improve efficiency in terms of how to generate certain documents or actually help us with automated decision making, planning, execution, etcetera, we just need to bring them in and adopt them to our needs quickly, if we can,” Kendall said.\n\nAaron Mehta in Washington contributed to this report.",

The government still bought it, simply because a crap product is the only available option.\n\nAnd to be real with you, we can't beat China tech. In terms of the quality, price and speed ratio, China dominates anduril by a landslide. The US can dominate on quality, but we we give up speed and price as a result. And if you want quality, anduril is not at the forefront of this at all.\n\nYou can speak for your own department. Some of us are shipping products and know what we're doing.\n\nIt's insane to think it would make sense to build on anything other than the best existing commercial technology and expect it to be reliable, affordable and maintainable. The military would not and should not change everything from Windows/Linux and Chrome to some completely custom OS and UI. (In the places we do provide products with the latter, we are more than state-of-the-art.)\n\nAvionics have been piggybacking off of commercial electronics due to the sheer scale since at least the 1980's because it just makes sense, while the primes have been slow to do the same in software, partly due to mindsets like yours.\n\nAnd the fact is, when creating software, everything starts out buggy, because nothing exists. That's why you develop, test and fix it. Normally we of course wouldn't ship anything that's not perfect, but our customers have begged us for products, saying they have nothing that can deal with some of the threats they face and so are okay with having to restart an app every now and then until it's ironed out.\n\nPlus, if you can see through Anduril's marketing, how can you not see through China's marketing?\n\nNATO did exactly what you suggest: at the request of Russians, shut the door to NATO for Georgia and Ukraine.\n\nWhere do you get this interpretation from, honest question. In Bucharest 2008 France and Germany voiced opposition against a NATO membership of Georgia and Ukraine. Despite that resistance the declarations of the summit says the following.\n\nWe reiterate that decisions on enlargement are for NATO itself to make. [...] NATO welcomes Ukraine’s and Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations for membership in NATO. We agreed today that these countries will become members of NATO. Both nations have made valuable contributions to Alliance operations.\n\nIn December 2021 Russia made a final attempt to get a political resolution of the conflict, sending letters to the US president and NATO demanding an agreement. The response came in January 2022.\n\nWhat we have made clear is that we will not compromise on some core principles. And one of them is, of course, that every nation has the right to choose its own path. So NATO respects a country or a nation when they decide to apply for NATO membership, as for instance, Ukraine [...]\n\nI don't see how this can be interpreted as abandoning the idea of a NATO membership for Ukraine. It also somewhat misrepresent the process, it is of course in the hands of NATO members to admit new members, a country wanting to join does not mean much on its own.\n\nAlso article 10 says that new members must be in a position to contribute to the security in the treaty area. Depending on how one understands that sentence, a NATO membership of Ukraine - or even just its consideration - arguably achieved the exact opposite, at least for the moment.\n\n> Where do you get this interpretation from, honest question. In Bucharest 2008 France and Germany voiced opposition against a NATO membership of Georgia and Ukraine. Despite that resistance the declarations of the summit says the following.\n\nThese are just nice words for consolation. At the same summit in Bucharest, NATO decided not to offer Ukraine and Georgia a Membership Action Plan, which is the procedure for joining NATO. NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia in any forseeable future was off the table. The prospect was from time to time dangled in front of them to encourage reforms and modernization, but that was it. The prospect of Turkey joining the EU has been of similar nature for many decades with little actual progress.\n\n> Also article 10 says that new members must be in a position to contribute to the security in the treaty area. Depending on how one understands that sentence, a NATO membership of Ukraine - or even just its consideration - arguably achieved the exact opposite, at least for the moment.\n\nThat is generally understood as a requirement to maintain a capable fighting force and not to freeride on the backs of others in the alliance (see Article 3; Article 10 establishes the same requirement for new applicants). I don't think any reasonable person would call Ukraine freeriders. At the moment, they are one of the most capable fighting forces in the world, and will no doubt invest heavily in armed forces after the war.\n\n> In December 2021 Russia made a final attempt to get a political resolution of the conflict, sending letters to the US president and NATO demanding an agreement. The response came in January 2022.\n\nRussia demanded that the country I live in should be kicked out of NATO. The last time they made such ultimatums, my government chose to satisfy their demands in an attempt to use all means possible to avoid confrontation. In the end, Russians demanded military bases on our soil as forward posts against possible attacks from Central Europe (Napoleon and all that, 2023 isn't the first time around seeing that narrative). Tens of thousands of soldiers, countless tanks and artillery guns were brought in. Those bases were used as a staging area for taking over our national institutions and installing a puppet government that immediately asked Russians to officially occupy us. Widespread terror against the population followed, including deportation of tens of thousands of women and children in cattle cars to die in Siberian gulags. For half a century that followed, until 1991, they did all they could to suppress our language, culture and identity. They replaced a third of the population in the country with Russians, in an attempt to destroy our identity and merge us into an indistinguishable and unseparatable part of Russia. We were literally becoming a minority in our own country.\n\nBut by sheer luck, that Russian empire of shit collapsed due to chronic mismanagement and internal rotting. We were able to restore independence. Sweden helped immensely in getting Russian occupying force to leave in 1994. In a decade, we were able to crawl out of the shithole Russians forced us into, and satisfied all requirements needed to join the EU and NATO. Modern military with civilian oversight, a modern government with separation of powers, rule of law and high level of protection of human rights, high quality of life, some of the highest press freedom, economic freedom and other rankings in the world.\n\nWhy should we abandon all that, isolate ourselves internationally, and make ourselves a juicy target for Russians to invade again and force us back under their boot?\n\nFinland, I stress, took the other route the last time around. Facing Russian ultimatums, they chose war. While they lost Karelia and Petsamo, they managed to keep their independence. After the war, they chose political neutrality and stayed out of NATO, but spent decades building up one of the largest armes in Europe against any future Russian invasions. Seeing the genocidal nature and the immense scale of Russian war against Ukraine dashed any hope of fighting off another Russian war alone. Finland abandoned the strategy of neutrality and chose to step into alliance with other European nations, as did the Swedes.\n\nSo despite quite different paths our countries took in the 20th century, we've all now reached the same conclusion that strong international cooperation is the best way to maintain our independence and security in the 21st century.\n\nAre we all dumb and wrong? Should we cut ties and put our hopes on prayers that we won't become the target of the next war Russia decides to launch?\n\nIf you are the prime minister of Finland, Estonia or Poland, what is the responsible choice here that serves the interests of your people the best?\n\nYou actually believe Putin? Hahaha.\n\n> Why did they invade?\n\nLike I already stated earlier, because they want to control it like Georgia, Chechnya, Dagestan and Belarus. Only 1 of those countries was considered for NATO membership after the conflict kept going since 91 (considered membership in 2008).\n\n> What evidence do you have to the contrary?\n\n- Russia invading the North Caucasus (Chechnya, Dagestan, ...), without NATO having anything to do with it. *Please answer why they invaded.*\n\n- Russia kept attacking Georgia since 91. Putin came in power in 2000 and he escalated that war, until it reached its peak in 2008 when NATO considered Georgias membership. So did Russia start that conflict because of NATO, or did Georgia wanted to join because of the conflict since 91? *Please answer why Russia kept the conflict going from 91 to 2008*\n\n- Finland, a country with a huge border with Russia, applied for NATO membership in May 2022. Russia didn't invade that country to prevent them from joining *Please answer me why not*\n\n- If Finland is such a huge threat for Russia because of NATO, *please show Russian troop buildup on that border since Finland applied and joined.*\n\n- In 1999, Russia was one of the signatories of the Charter for European Security, which \"reaffirmed the inherent right of each and every participating State to be free to choose or change its security arrangements, including treaties of alliance, as they evolve.\"\n\nAnd last but not least, your dear friend Mr Putin said the following in 2002, as documented on the Kremlin website:\n\n\"On the topic of Ukraine’s accession to NATO, the Russian President said that it was entitled to make the decision independently. He does not see it as something that could cloud the relations between Russia and Ukraine.\"\n\nGo read it at the Kremlin website http://www.en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/43122. *Anything to say about that?*\n\n> But none of that even addresses my argument, Russia opposed NATO expansion, Russia threatened severe consequences, NATO gave no signs that Ukraine would not be allowed to join NATO or entered any kind of negotiations, Russia delivered on its promise. The outcome was rather predictable, at least ignoring that Russia did not react as strongly to previous NATO expansions.\n\nOh, so we're supposed to just listen and obey every dictator out there now? We are supposed to listen and obey when North Korea threatens our (or our ally's) destruction? Are we supposed to just sit back and let China dredge up new islands out of nothing in the South China Sea, and then claim the entire thing is now their territorial waters? Are we supposed to just let them have Taiwan too? How many times has China threatened something when we sold Taiwan some more F-16s or some other military hardware?\n\nAnd what about our threats? Do you think the Kremlin wasn't warned about what the consequences to Russia would be if they invaded in 2022? Why shouldn't Putin have listened to us?\n\n> My point is just that there was a relatively simple situation, Russia warns NATO, one step closer and there will be war, and NATO decides that it will make that step.\n\nWhat's funny with all this is that Finland and Sweden resisted joining NATO for decades, despite being very closely aligned with the rest of Europe. Russia made angry noises about that for years and years, and they listened. Wow! Exactly what you thought should happen! Fantastic!\n\nAnd then Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Then those two countries decided they could no longer listen to the threats coming from Russia, and had to choose what was best for their own security and prosperity. And so they joined NATO to protect themselves.\n\nWhy do you think Poland, one of the poorest countries in Europe, has been giving proportionately so much aid to Ukraine? Because they fear for the war spreading, and want to stop Russia now. Why do you think Poland wanted to join NATO back in 1999? Even though one of the member countries of NATO (Germany) that had invaded them 50 years earlier? Did they fear that Poland was going to be invaded by NATO, that this was some coercion? No, because NATO doesn't invade other countries.\n\nPoland joined NATO because they were worried about the other country that had also invaded them 50 years previously, Russia.\n\nAre you starting to see that it is Russia that is the problem here?",
      "# [Defense tech startup Anduril aims to take a Tesla-like approach to weapons manufacturing by Josh Lipton on 2024-08-16](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/defense-tech-startup-anduril-aims-to-take-a-tesla-like-approach-to-weapons-manufacturing-185317884.html)\nModern warfare is evolving, and Anduril Industries has a plan to capitalize on this shift by reimagining the design and production of American military power.\n\nThe defense technology startup recently raised $1.5 billion in a new funding round to scale its weapons manufacturing. The deal, which was co-led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and Sands Capital, values Anduril at $14 billion, nearly double the startup’s valuation after its previous funding round two years ago.\n\nAnduril’s strategy is to increase American weapons manufacturing by replicating the modern techniques and processes employed by commercial powerhouses such as Elon Musk’s Tesla (TSLA). In other words, it's using a software-first approach flexible enough to build weapons quickly and at scale.\n\n“What we are doing at Anduril is we are taking the risk up front to build the capabilities and to build the infrastructure that we need to deploy those capabilities very quickly,” Trae Stephens, co-founder and executive chairman of Anduril and partner at Founders Fund, told Yahoo Finance (video above).\n\n“Now is that a bet on ourselves that, once we produce these things, the customer will show up to buy it?” Stephens asked. “Absolutely, but I think that is the way it should work. There should be some risk taken from an industry perspective as well.”\n\nAnduril plans to use the majority of the funds to invest in a new software-defined manufacturing platform and build a new manufacturing facility called Arsenal-1.\n\nThe factory is expected to ultimately employ more than 1,500 people, encompass more than 5 million square feet of manufacturing capacity, and produce tens of thousands of weapons, such as counterstrike drones and autonomous submarines, per year.\n\nWhile the company has not yet determined where the Arsenal-1 facility will be located, it already has experience building out its manufacturing footprint.\n\nIn June, Anduril announced a $75 million investment to increase manufacturing and production capacity for solid rocket motors in Mississippi. That same month, the company also announced the opening of a facility in Rhode Island, enabling Anduril to increase production of underwater drones.\n\nStartups like Anduril, which aim to disrupt the American defense industry and take on the \"primes\" — giants like Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), General Dynamics (GD), RTX (RTX), and Northrop Grumman (NOC) — have attracted venture investors to the sector.\n\nBetween 2021 and mid-June of this year, venture capitalists invested $130 billion in defense tech startups, according to PitchBook.",
      "# [Anduril reveals Roadrunner drone, mum on first US customer by Courtney Albon on 2023-12-01](https://www.c4isrnet.com/unmanned/2023/12/01/anduril-reveals-roadrunner-drone-mum-on-first-us-customer/)\nWASHINGTON — Anduril Industries unveiled its latest autonomous system, Roadrunner — a reusable aircraft that can carry a range of payloads, takeoff vertically and intercept and destroy airborne threats.\n\nThe California-based technology firm revealed two variants of the system Dec. 1. The baseline Roadrunner can quickly launch and fly at high subsonic speeds and its payloads can be reconfigured for a variety of missions.\n\nRoadrunner-M is a munitions version of the system designed to protect against uncrewed aerial system threats. The company says the vehicle can rapidly locate, track and disable adversary systems and its interceptors can be recovered, refueled and reused if they’re not deployed.\n\n“Instead of having to fire multiple interceptors at one threat, you can now deploy multiple interceptors to go out and loiter, to gather additional intelligence, to be on site in a timely way in the case that you actually want to employ them,” Chief of Strategy Chris Brose told reporters Nov. 28.\n\nPalmer Luckey, founder of Anduril , told reporters during the same embargoed briefing the company has been designing, building and demonstrating the Roadrunner systems with its own funding for two years and is about to begin low-rate production through a contract with a U.S. customer.\n\nLuckey declined to disclose the customer, but said the initial order is for “hundreds of units” and he expects the company will quickly scale into the hundreds of thousands. Brose noted that the U.S. government has been closely watching the effort and Roadrunner has demonstrated operational utility through a rigorous flight test program.\n\n“One of our main motivations as a company has been to prove it and then talk about it,” Brose said. “I think we’re at the beginning of that conversation on Roadrunner.”\n\nThe use of uncrewed aircraft systems on the battlefield has expanded in recent years and the Defense Department is working to both leverage the potential of swarming drones in its own arsenal and counter increased threats from adversaries.\n\nThe Pentagon established the Joint Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office to develop a coordinated, long-term response to drone threats in 2019, and in August, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks revealed a new DoD initiative called Replicator to field thousands of autonomous systems over the next two years.\n\nBrose said Roadrunner was designed with both of those challenges in mind.\n\n“We’re very hopeful that the government will see in this capability what we see in it, which is a novel solution that is built to be adaptable to where those threats are going in the near future – which, by the way, has been a process that’s been playing out over the past few years, and it’s just going to get worse,” he said.\n\nCounter-drone systems\n\nFielding capabilities such as drones and other high-need systems in larger quantities is a “critical challenge,” for DoD right now, Brose said, but he’s hopeful the department is serious about funding large-scale production efforts.\n\n“Our belief and our hope is that this is an opportunity to really produce this capability at scale, which is something we are absolutely capable of doing,” he said.\n\nOn cost, Luckey said a single Roadrunner is “in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars,” but the company expects that to drop as it produces the systems at a higher rate.\n\n“The more of these we make, the cheaper they get,” he said, adding that the company’s decision to build its own turbojet engines rather than work with another supplier will help it control cost and performance moving forward.\n\nBrose noted that while Roadrunner-M may cost more than other counter-drone systems, it can address a wider range of threats, making it a lower cost alternative to missiles like the Patriot, which cost about $4 million each.\n\n“Roadrunner can come in and actually fill a gap in the market that is perhaps maybe a bit more exquisite and a bit more expensive than those low-end solutions, but it’s going to be an order of magnitude cheaper than a patriot missile,” he said. “That seems like a pretty good deal to us.”\n\nCourtney Albon is C4ISRNET’s space and emerging technology reporter.

      "# [Cost ‘Barracuda’ Cruise Missiles by John Tirpak on 2024-09-12](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/anduril-unveils-new-low-cost-cruise-missiles/)\nShare Article\n\nAnduril Industries has revealed its “Barracuda” family of cruise missiles, intended to bulk up U.S. military stockpiles with a low-cost weapon that can be produced in large numbers by minimally trained labor with unspecialized tools.\n\nThe air-breathing weapons as yet have not been fitted with sensors, as customer needs are still undefined, but the weapons are in flight test, company officials told reporters Sept. 11. The Barracuda family is intended to be rapidly upgradable through software and an open-systems architecture.\n\nThe family of weapons comprises the Barracuda-100, -250, and -500.\n\nThe -500 is meant to be “cargo launched,” said Diem Salmon, Anduril vice president for air dominance and strike. This refers to the Air Force’s “Rapid Dragon” concept of launching pallets of cruise missiles from the back of a C-17 or C-130 transport, which has been tested using AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSMs).\n\nIt is also the kind of mission the Air Force and Defense Innovation Unit are exploring for their Enterprise Test Vehicle program, which got underway in June. Anduril is one of four competitors for the effort and is pitching the Barracuda-500, Salmon said. The other companies in the running are Integrated Solutions for Systems, Inc.; Leidos Dynetics; and Zone 5 Technologies. Salmon couldn’t comment on the ETV program progress.\n\nThe pallet-launched missiles “do not necessarily require aircraft integration,” she said. The -250, meanwhile, is designed to be carried internally on the F-35 and other platforms.\n\nThe Barracuda is “available in configurations offering 500+ nautical miles of range, 100+ pounds of payload capacity, 5 Gs of maneuverability, and more than 120 minutes of loitering time,” the company said in a press release.\n\n“All Barracudas are compatible with a host of payloads and employment mechanisms, support a variety of different missions, and provide warfighters with an adaptable and upgradeable capability to counter evolving threats,” the company said.\n\nAnduril is “targeting 30 percent less cost than systems that are comparable in performance,” Salmon said, but she did not offer comparisons with specific weapons. The company thinks that this level of savings can be achieved by reusing subsystems and easier manufacture with low-cost materials.\n\n“So, rather than designing bespoke capabilities for each single weapon system, how do we make this simpler?” Salmon said. Open architectures is one solution, while designing the missile to be made by a factory worker with little specialized knowledge, using a small number of tools and parts, is another.\n\n“A single Barracuda takes 50 percent less time to produce, requires 95 percent fewer tools, and 50 percent fewer parts than competing solutions on the market today,” the company said in press materials. “As a result, the Barracuda family of AAVs is 30 percent cheaper on average than other solutions, enabling affordable mass and cost-effective, large-scale employment.”\n\nAnduril rolled out its “Arsenal” manufacturing plant idea in recent weeks, teasing announcements about weapons like Barracuda and its “Fury” Collaborative Combat Aircraft that would be made in the state-of-the art factory. It is proceeding from the assumption that the U.S. needs 10 times the number of precision weapons it now has in order to deter China and not “run out of stuff” to shoot in the first few weeks of a major conflict, Anduril chief strategy officer Chris Brose said.\n\n“We’ve been at work on this for a few years,” Brose said. “This is a real system. It is already a part of real programs. It’s flying, and we’re really excited to finally be able to talk more about it publicly.\n\n“The problem that we are seeking to solve here, I think, is a familiar one to many of you, which is America and our allies and partners do not have enough weapons. Period, full stop. And we are not capable of producing the volume of weapons that we’re going to need to establish deterrence against a peer competitor.”\n\nBrose noted wargames that showed that the U.S. runs out of critical munitions in the first few weeks of a conflict.\n\n“Then we struggle, or theoretically would struggle, for a period of years to replenish all the weapons that we expended,” he said. “And I think Ukraine has put that problem in high relief for the past few years on far simpler tactical weapon systems, to say nothing of the larger critical munitions that are going to be so essential for an INDOPACOM scenario.”\n\nSalmon said it’s “unrealistic for us to believe that we will know exactly how many we need to produce 10 years from now,” and factories will have to be able to efficiently “ramp up, and sometimes, you have to ramp down.”\n\nShe added Anduril is aiming to reduce parts count, tooling, and complexity and “rely more on commercial components.” The entire work force as a whole won’t be “bespoke to just one single system,” she said.\n\nBrose said every variant of Barracuda “leverages core subsystems which are reusable across the family of systems. These are systems that can be assembled with tools, literally that you probably have in your garage—screwdrivers, pliers, things of that sort, so it is not gated in terms of its producibility on highly specialized tooling, highly specialized manufacturing processes, highly specialized labor, none of which we’re ever going to have enough of. It’s been designed with the exact opposite approach, which is, I have to leverage commercial supply chains as much as possible. I have to make the weapon as simple to produce and as simple to assemble as possible.”\n\nAll three variants are flying now, Salmon said.\n\n“These are things that we’re actively working on day-to-day,” she said."
