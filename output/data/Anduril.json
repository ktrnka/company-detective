      "# [Lattice SDK core concepts](https://docs.anduril.com/guide/concepts)\nThis page covers core concepts and use cases for building with the Lattice SDK™.\n\nSince its founding, Anduril has excelled in building integrated systems that function reliably in austere and even hostile environments. Anduril's first Sentry Towers performed key workloads such as computer vision and sensor fusion locally at the edge in order to automatically triage suspected threats from the environment, independent of a human operator. As we introduced new products such as Anvil, we continued to push processing and collaboration to the edge, rather than centralize logic on data center servers.\n\nThis local-first DNA is embodied in all of Anduril's products, and the networking and autonomy technologies which Anduril has built to achieve integration and collaboration among these local-first products form the backbone of Anduril’s differentiated capability. We call this backbone Lattice, and this SDK is meant to help accelerate your ability to quickly build decentralized applications that can deploy and interoperate with other systems on the mesh.\n\nAs you build your solution, we recommend adopting the following core principles to ensure your application can operate successfully on the mesh:\n\nLocal-First Design - A network connection can not be assumed to be constant nor abundant. In order to deliver applications that perform well in a degradable mesh network environment, developers should be highly responsible with bandwidth utilization and build in the assumption that the network may be spotty or fail on a regular basis. For the best experience, we recommend designing with network failure in mind.\n\nData Exchange through Open Data Models - In order for our systems to interoperate they must speak the same language. Anduril has standardized key data models which are utilized across all of Anduril's products and applications.\n\nWe believe embracing these two simple principles allow our teams to move quickly and independently, without sacrificing our ability to deliver integrated solutions. This approach fosters interoperability without requiring high levels of prior coordination. As long as teams adhere to standard data models and build systems that can work in local, disconnected environments, bringing them together can be a simple process.\n\nWe believe in this model so strongly that we’re publishing this framework as the Lattice SDK which supports developers in building decentralized and interoperable solutions.\n\nWith the Lattice SDK and its open data models, Anduril allows every bespoke data system and hardware platform to become general purpose to the extent it integrates with a large and growing set of networked, data-centric applications and physical systems at the tactical edge.\n\nThe Lattice SDK documents and implements two foundational structured data models:\n\nAn entity is the representation of anything in the world that is significant as an aspect of situational awareness. Examples of entities include assets clearly emitting their well known location such as aircraft or ground vehicles as well as estimated positions of radio emitters. For more information, see Entities overview.\n\nA task models a command to a networked actor to perform some useful action. Actors are as diverse as robotic vehicles, electronic sensor systems, and manned platforms. Tasks may command effects-oriented actions, provide sensing priorities, trigger configuration changes, and more.\n\nBy implementing both a local-first architecture and specific data models such as entity and task, developers are able to quickly deliver new, innovative value alongside complementary and synergistic solutions in a common data mesh.",

Congrats to Blue Force technologies for their Fury design, but I don’t think Anduril deserves any praise (or credit) just for buying them out. \n\nThey also don’t have much applicable experience in terms of developing aircraft of this scale (size or production volume), and the production contract will be likely to go to one of primes or GA-ASI regardless of their demonstrator’s success.

In newer anduril versions they can be enabled as main channels but they only have the two brightness levels you can see when they are in aux mode. The HD10 is essentially a white light only deal. If you want RGB as a proper high brightness main light, you want the HD*01*.

But this are tiny LEDs intended for fun, they will not provide useful lighting.\n\nAlso anduril... people here will disagree and i'll get downvoted to hell, but my opinion is - it is not a good UI for a tool. It is only nice for toys. Yes, it offers a lot of flexibility in some ways, but then it is absolutely rigid and not configurable at all in others. It also offers no way to lock configuration, so you always have a chance to screw something up by misclicking or something in the most inconvenient moment when you need the light to work. Or it might screw itself up if signal tube is not making good contact or something, requiring a reset and reconfiguration.",

Apparently Durendal was the name of the mythical sword of one of the emperor Charlemagne's paladins named Roland.  It was said to be the sharpest sword in existence and was used to hold off a 100,000 strong Muslim army.  It struck me as strange that if you rearranged the syllables in Durendal you could get Endural which is somewhat close to Anduril.  Coincidence???\n\nOn a side note, Roland also carried a famous oliphant which is an ivory hunting horn used to call for aid.  It looks strikingly like the horn of Gondor.

The appearance of Boromir's horn in the movies being similar to a real life horn may be coincidence, but it's also just as likely to be an inspiration.\n\nAs for Andúril and Durandal being similarly named, it's very likely that Tolkien drew upon any number of mythical blades when creating the story behind any of the blades in his stories, but the names are almost entirely constructed using his languages. That is why LotR exists at all, as a vehicle for his languages.\n\nThe only explicit reference is Avallónë, a sea port on the shores of Tol Eressëa.\n\n### Comment ID d74s6jn with +3 score by [(PurelySC, Reddit, 2016-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/50k46o/anduril/d74s6jn/) (in reply to ID d74poa2):\n>That is why LotR exists at all, as a vehicle for his languages.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but isn't that why *The Silmarillion* exists?

I looked into it. Still have 8 as of today. I am really curious about the tang construction. I am assuming it is threaded into the pommel. Probably the best way to make a \"functional\" Anduril while still having the cutout in the pommel.\nBut even the ad seems hesitant about just how functional it is. \nThey specifically mention that the blade is tempered \"reasonably well\".\nAnd that it is best as a \"show piece\" or \"light cutting\".\nThose suggest to me even they don't have full faith in its strength and durability. Perhaps it even stays bent due to its \"reasonable temper\" vs. well tempered. \nI am tempted to try it but....I am getting the UC Museum Collection Anduril soon that also has the carbon blade, although a non functional handle.....\nBut UC is also releasing a new sword for their \"Battle forged\" line that is Anduril, just without all the flourishes, and a more reasonable size, with a true PEEED tang! So it will be as good as their other Battle Forged swords, which are solid. I will be getting that one, so not sure I really need this one.

The tables linked in here are better, but it's still not great.\n\nAt a certain point, demanding that all functionality, no matter how complex or numerous, be addressed by just button clicks stops being the best way to do things when there are viable alternatives. \n\nAny flashlight that has a USB port should allow writing configs to the flashlight and skipping all the button pressing. \n\nAny flashlight that can be set by button clicking can have an adapter for hooking into the on / off circuit that would allow updating all these options without the manual labor.\n\nBluetooth and wifi chips with antennas built in are getting smaller every year and integrating one or the other going forward is a better alternative for manufacturers serving enthusiasts.\n\nAnd to preempt any \"So do it yourself!\" or \"How many PCBs have you designed?\" nonsense replies, you don't have to be a chef to know when the food you're eating isn't great. \n\nManufacturers want to give you what you want.

People say it is too complicated but rather I think it is like being able to make your torch function the way you want to without thinking \"I wish my light can do this\", because with Anduril, you have less opportunity cost options to deal with.\n\nI think really the main point of Anduril is its \"set and forget\" feature. It has a lot of options, but it doesn't mean you need to click it a lot of times every time. Once you set it up the way you like, it is good to go and you don't have to switch to set modes too.\n\nAlso, you can download the eeprom as well, meaning you can save your options settings and potentially transfer it to other Anduril lights with the same features and firmware build.\n\n## Comment ID kb3j1xn with +3 score by [(Geromegoons, Reddit, 2023-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kb3j1xn/) (in reply to ID 185cxre):\nRidiculous.\n\nI enjoy tinkering and nerding out over things like torches but when I see this my honest reaction is \"I'm not reading that\".\n\nIs there not a way we just plug the torch in to a USB port on a PC and config it with a small program?

So he would have fought with it one handed while Aragorn, many times removed from Numenor, would have to use two hands.\n\n## Comment ID j5ypbtr with +7 score by [(Technology-Mission, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j5ypbtr/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nThis is a fantasy sword but the pommel just acts partially as an extension of the grip. As others mentioned historical examples can have the same. Not typically this ratio though.\n\n## Comment ID j5zbyhi with +2 score by [(j0giwa, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j5zbyhi/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nProbably just for style points, but the grip is long enough for leverage even though it's not as grippy a the rest.\n\n## Comment ID j5zn6bi with +2 score by [(Galluxior, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j5zn6bi/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nbecause Aragorn is just built different\n\n## Comment ID j60fzwj with +2 score by [(sethasaurus666, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j60fzwj/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nIt's basically a longer bastard sword and the grip is a also longer (like a long sword).

Second: because it can be used both one and two handed, which was done quite a bit historically with different techniques. Fiore teaches all kinds of techniques with two handed grip, one handed with nothing in the off hand, one handed with shield (I think, maybe not), and one handed with dagger in the off hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID j604ut2 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j604ut2/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nAesthetics\n\n## Comment ID j60f1n8 with +1 score by [(HyperionSaber, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j60f1n8/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nfor the raddity\n\n## Comment ID j60qk3b with +1 score by [(gaerat_of_trivia, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j60qk3b/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nso you can grip with two hands\n\n## Comment ID j60r1b6 with +1 score by [(ZephRyder, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j60r1b6/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nThe real answer is this: because the leather/grip part only encompasses half the hilt part, and rest of the tail is pommel.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ps1z7fmb5iea1.jpeg?width=220&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=892c5c71de47f4d3196f057eca31ed00e0f0bdbf\n\n## Comment ID j60zw0r with +1 score by [(point50tracer, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j60zw0r/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nDesign choice. It looks really cool. You grip the pommel with the second hand. It also allows for a heavier pommel that isn't super bulky. With how long Anduril is. The larger pommel probably helps a lot with balance.\n\n## Comment ID j61cqhu with +1 score by [(DIO_696969, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j61cqhu/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nI mean I was messing around with a to scale prop of it and it’s easier to use than you would think\n\n## Comment ID j61gwke with +1 score by [(theDukeofClouds, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j61gwke/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nIf I'm not mistaken there were a few swords with half leather wrapped half metal hilts.\n\n## Comment ID j61mqum with +1 score by [(investlike_a_warrior, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j61mqum/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nI have a cheap replica of this and I got to say, it’s one of the hardest swords to use.  That cross guard doesn’t do it any favors. \n\nBut I will say this.\n\nThat pummel  mirrors the blades edge, meaning the blade and the curve of the handle match angles. So you can slide your hand onto the pummel and use it to help guide your strikes. Very effective in real combat when you need a easy way to make sure your blade is swinging true.\n\n## Comment ID j624qc5 with +1 score by [(announakis, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j624qc5/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nNot a two handed sword but a hand and a half technically.\n\n### Comment ID j64ewwk with +1 score by [(Hwarrior12, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j64ewwk/) (in reply to ID j624qc5):\nClearly two handed don't be this stupid\n\n#### Comment ID j6696wy with +1 score by [(announakis, Reddit, 2023-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j6696wy/) (in reply to ID j64ewwk):\nNarsil’s type of sword is a longsword aka bastard sword aka hand and a half sword.\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longsword\n\nA two handed sword refers specifically to a larger set of swords that appeared later known today mostly as zweihander but the real terms are epee de guerre, spadone, bidenhander etc\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_swords#Handedness\n\nWho is stupid now?\n\n## Comment ID j62vchs with +1 score by [(thebigfil, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j62vchs/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nBecause it's not real?\n\n## Comment ID j65rimb with +1 score by [(OhZvir, Reddit, 2023-01-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j65rimb/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nI love Tolkien works and been reading and re-reading his works since I was a kid, but I never really wanted to have a movie version of this sword.

The current structure has fostered an elitist, snobbish culture where openly disparaging others is not only tolerated but seemingly ingrained. This toxicity must be addressed.\n\nA meaningful step forward would be the introduction of a voluntary mentorship program—one that fosters leadership, guidance, and accountability without forcing participation. Additionally, establishing a clear career roadmap with pathways to roles beyond just management, such as technical leadership, program management, or cross-functional opportunities, would give employees a sense of direction and growth without feeling trapped in a toxic hierarchy. Without these changes, the current environment leaves employees walking on eggshells, uncertain about their job security from one month to the next.\n\nIt’s unsettling to work within a company that outwardly presents itself as cutting-edge and innovative, yet internally operates in a way that erodes trust and morale.",

As a result, I have witnessed teams openly disparage individuals both inside and outside the company, even going so far as to blacklist potential hires. For a newer employee, this creates an incredibly demotivating atmosphere.\n\nThis culture is not emerging in isolation—it is being cultivated, trickling down through the ranks, and setting the stage for future toxic leaders. Without deliberate intervention, this problem will only grow, ultimately damaging morale, innovation, and the company’s ability to attract and retain top talent.",

Engineers are as talented and as capable as I've seen at FAANG companies I've worked at in the past, but managers were clearly promoted/hired without the scalability of the company in mind. Managers are skilled at engineering tasks, but are clueless when it comes to managing people. I've seen too many onboarding engineers left without proper support and insight into how to do their jobs well and it's actually pathetic. How do you expect new engineers to meet tight deadlines if they're not given the proper tools and support to do so? This company has the potential to be something great, but not the way it's being ran currently. However, even outside of management, most what's being built out is glorified demoware that the government is buying into because their software hasn't been updated since the 1990's and anything new is considered to be a massive upgrade.

It seems impossible to attend a meeting or engage in a conversation without Palantir being brought up. While it's reasonable to appreciate and model after a successful business, it becomes excessive when it feels like every new hire or internal initiative mirrors Palantir. I applied for a position at Anduril with the intention of contributing to and aligning with the unique culture of Anduril.\n\nWhile there are individuals who genuinely embody the values of Anduril, a significant portion seems to adopt Palantir's entire leadership, strategic, and cultural philosophy. While Palantir has undoubtedly achieved noteworthy accomplishments, it's important to note that Palantir is not synonymous with Palmer Luckey. If individuals are joining the company solely because of Palmer, they might discover a scenario resembling Palantir 2.0, as opposed to the original vision they may have anticipated.",

You can expand your hiring to be more diverse, but without a culture that feels safe and inclusive, you won't be able to keep them.

And PM/TPM means something different on every team. \nThe products don't actually work. What we're selling doesn't match what we actually have built.\nTesting is a nice-to-have, which won't scale for large UAVs.\n\nA good chunk of these positive reviews come from an all-hands where poor interview practices/feedback was brought up and the solution was telling employees to flood Glassdoor with positive reviews vs fixing practices.",

You can expand your hiring to be more diverse, but without a culture that feels safe and inclusive, you won't be able to keep them.

And PM/TPM means something different on every team. \nThe products don't actually work. What we're selling doesn't match what we actually have built.\nTesting is a nice-to-have, which won't scale for large UAVs.\n\nA good chunk of these positive reviews come from an all-hands where poor interview practices/feedback was brought up and the solution was telling employees to flood Glassdoor with positive reviews vs fixing practices.",

I applied for a position at Anduril with the intention of contributing to and aligning with the unique culture of Anduril.\n\nWhile there are individuals who genuinely embody the values of Anduril, a significant portion seems to adopt Palantir's entire leadership, strategic, and cultural philosophy. While Palantir has undoubtedly achieved noteworthy accomplishments, it's important to note that Palantir is not synonymous with Palmer Luckey. If individuals are joining the company solely because of Palmer, they might discover a scenario resembling Palantir 2.0, as opposed to the original vision they may have anticipated.",

Managers are skilled at engineering tasks, but are clueless when it comes to managing people.

How do you expect new engineers to meet tight deadlines if they're not given the proper tools and support to do so? This company has the potential to be something great, but not the way it's being ran currently. However, even outside of management, most what's being built out is glorified demoware that the government is buying into because their software hasn't been updated since the 1990's and anything new is considered to be a massive upgrade.

The current structure has fostered an elitist, snobbish culture where openly disparaging others is not only tolerated but seemingly ingrained. This toxicity must be addressed.\n\nA meaningful step forward would be the introduction of a voluntary mentorship program—one that fosters leadership, guidance, and accountability without forcing participation. Additionally, establishing a clear career roadmap with pathways to roles beyond just management, such as technical leadership, program management, or cross-functional opportunities, would give employees a sense of direction and growth without feeling trapped in a toxic hierarchy. Without these changes, the current environment leaves employees walking on eggshells, uncertain about their job security from one month to the next.\n\nIt’s unsettling to work within a company that outwardly presents itself as cutting-edge and innovative, yet internally operates in a way that erodes trust and morale.",
        "cons": "Anduril’s internal culture is plagued by toxic elitism and unchecked negativity, creating a work environment that is both discouraging and unprofessional. Unlike my experience at a prime defense company—where strong leadership actively curbed such behavior—Anduril lacks the necessary oversight to prevent toxic attitudes from taking root.\n\nA significant factor in this issue appears to be the promotion of engineers into leadership roles despite their lack of experience in mentorship, management, and team-building. As a result, I have witnessed teams openly disparage individuals both inside and outside the company, even going so far as to blacklist potential hires. For a newer employee, this creates an incredibly demotivating atmosphere.\n\nThis culture is not emerging in isolation—it is being cultivated, trickling down through the ranks, and setting the stage for future toxic leaders. Without deliberate intervention, this problem will only grow, ultimately damaging morale, innovation, and the company’s ability to attract and retain top talent.",

      "# [Ohio Partners with Anduril to “Rebuild the Arsenal” for Essential National Security Needs](https://governor.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/governor/media/news-and-media/ohio-partners-with-anduril-to-rebuild-the-arsenal-for-essential-national-security-needs)\n(PICKAWAY COUNTY, Ohio)— Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, Lt. Governor Jon Husted, and JobsOhio announced today that Anduril Industries, a leader in defense technology, will establish an advanced manufacturing facility in Pickaway County, bringing more than 4,000 new production and service jobs to Ohio by 2035.\n\nThe five-million-square-foot facility, named Arsenal-1, represents the largest single job creation and new payroll project in Ohio’s history and is projected to add nearly $1 billion to Ohio’s gross domestic product.\n\nBased in Costa Mesa, Calif., Anduril aims to “Rebuild the Arsenal” of U.S. military weapons and platforms by “hyperscaling” manufacturing with advanced software and production technologies. The Ohio facility will strengthen the state’s position as a nationwide leader in the development of better, faster, and more affordable critical national defense products to help the United States deter, defend, and lead in the world’s Great Power Competition.\n\n“Ohio’s history of advancing aviation, aerospace, and national defense runs deep, but what sets this state apart is our readiness to embrace the future,” said Governor DeWine. “At this critical moment in time, our country needs rapid technological innovation, which Anduril will deliver using Ohio’s skilled, hardworking labor force. The future of American air power will be made in Ohio!”\n\nGov. DeWine & Lt. Gov. Husted will join Anduril to provide more information on this historic announcement today at 9 a.m. Watch live at OhioChannel.org.\n\nThe facility will be located on 500 acres in Pickaway County near Rickenbacker International Airport, with room for future growth. The company plans to invest over $900 million in capital into the surrounding area.\n\nAnduril was attracted to Ohio due to the state’s supportive business climate, ready-made workforce, and legacy of military and federal support.\n\n\"Today is a proud day for Ohio as we welcome Anduril and celebrate the creation of thousands of new jobs in cutting-edge defense manufacturing,” said Lt. Governor Jon Husted. “This investment reinforces Ohio's position as a leader in advanced technology and national security. When it comes to 'Made in America,' you can’t do it without 'Made in Ohio.”\n\nIn addition to the 4,000 direct jobs at Arsenal-1, the project is anticipated to create a total of 4,500 indirect and induced jobs over the next ten years and more than $2 billion in annual economic output. Over $1 billion in in-state labor income will be generated, and projected tax revenues are estimated to be roughly $800 million.\n\n“Arsenal-1 represents a significant step forward in how we build the autonomous systems and weapons our nation and allies need, leveraging Ohio’s world-class workforce, robust infrastructure, and scalable, software-driven manufacturing to set a new standard for securing the future of defense,” said Anduril Industries CEO Brian Schimpf. “We are ready to break ground and get to work building the capabilities that will strengthen America’s industrial base and national security for years to come.”\n\nThe project will pursue a Job Creation Tax Credit from the Ohio Department of Development at an upcoming Tax Credit Authority meeting. The project will also request $70 million from the All Ohio Future Fund at an upcoming Controlling Board meeting. The All Ohio Future Fund was established by the DeWine-Husted Administration in partnership with the Ohio General Assembly to support local communities with site-readiness and preparation to attract economic development projects.\n\nSeparately, JobsOhio plans to provide assistance to the project with a JobsOhio Grant and will disclose the amount of funding after the agreements have been signed. JobsOhio will also provide Anduril with Talent Acquisition Services to work with the company to attract, develop, and retain the skilled workforce the company requires.\n\nThe build out of the facility is expected to begin immediately after state and local approvals, and the first products are targeted to be manufactured beginning in July 2026.\n\nTo meet their bold staffing needs, Anduril will tap into Ohio's third-largest manufacturing workforce, a statewide network of hundreds of universities, community colleges, and technical centers, and leverage JobsOhio's Talent Acquisition Services.\n\nAnduril: Rebuilding the Arsenal in Ohio\n\nAnduril recently announced $1.5 billion in funding to hyperscale defense manufacturing. Arsenal-1 in Ohio will be the first manufacturing facility equipped to produce tens of thousands of autonomous weapons systems addressing the urgent needs of the United States and its allies. Anduril is redefining what scale means, which is necessary to support building capacity for future defense needs.\n\nUnlike traditional defense contractors that focus primarily on hardware, Anduril’s core system is Lattice OS, an AI-powered autonomous sensemaking and command-and-control platform. Lattice brings autonomy to defense's most challenging missions with open, modular, and scalable hardware components for a layered family-of-systems approach that helps deliver higher-quality products faster and more affordably.\n\nDesigned by Anduril. Built in Ohio.\n\nThe partnership established by Anduril and Team Ohio that led to today’s announcement reflects Ohio’s enduring legacy and ongoing commitment to the United States military and its evolving goal of safeguarding our nation. The project is also supported by One Columbus, Pickaway County officials, and many other local, state, and federal leaders.\n\nAlong with aerospace and defense work by GE Aerospace, Honeywell, Sierra Nevada Corp., Joby Aviation, L3 Harris, General Dynamics, and others, Anduril’s decision to make a home here shows how that heritage converges with a skilled, diverse workforce and unparalleled strength in advanced manufacturing and technology to make Ohio the go-to place for forward-looking innovators in the defense sector.\n\n“You can’t outsource national security, and today, Ohio is sending a message to the world: Companies that deliver the most complex, challenging, and sophisticated solutions for the defense of the United States of America will find no better home than right here in the ‘Heart of it All,’” said JobsOhio President and CEO J.P. Nauseef. “The intersection of advanced manufacturing, military and defense, technology, innovation, and the nation’s hardest-working and highly skilled workers creates the ideal environment for these companies to achieve their goals of making our country safer and stronger. Best of all, Anduril will be just down the road to the military customer at Wright Patterson Air Force Base - where the Wright Brothers learned to fly more than 100 years ago! As the United States reshores this capability and fundamentally changes the way we develop solutions to safeguard our nation, Ohio is the place that gets it done better, faster, and more affordably than anywhere else.”\n\nAnduril’s new Pickaway County facility will not only push the boundaries of manufacturing technology, it will also catalyze a new frontier of economic development in Ohio. Company officials chose the site in Pickaway County for several reasons, including its adjacent location to Rickenbacker International Airport, which gives the company direct runway access for product testing and development. Rickenbacker is a civil-military public airport that supports the world’s largest aircraft. It also offers a wide range of scalable services for all aircraft types, including corporate, general aviation, commercial, air freight, and military.\n\n“This project will diversify our economy, strengthen our nation, create thousands of terrific jobs, and immediately establish the Columbus Region as a center of defense technology and manufacturing,” said Kenny McDonald, President and CEO of One Columbus. “The bold leadership of the DeWine-Husted Administration, JobsOhio, and Pickaway County were pivotal in making this project a reality.”\n\nPickaway County Commissioner Jay Wippel added: “Pickaway County has spent nearly two decades preparing for this opportunity, laying the groundwork to attract transformative projects like Arsenal-1.

      "# [Anduril Industries by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2020-05-30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anduril_Industries)\nAmerican defense technology company\n\nAnduril Industries, Inc. is an American defense technology company that specializes in autonomous systems. It was cofounded in 2017 by inventor and entrepreneur Palmer Luckey and others.[3][4] Anduril aims to sell to the U.S. Department of Defense, including artificial intelligence and robotics. Anduril's major products include unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and counter-UAS (CUAS), semi-portable autonomous surveillance systems, and networked command and control software.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAnduril Industries is named for Andúril, the fictional sword of Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings.[5] Translated from the novels' constructed language Quenya, the name means Flame of the West.[6]\n\nInvestor meetups\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2014, Palmer Luckey, the creator of the virtual reality headset Oculus Rift, attended a retreat on Sonora Island, British Columbia, hosted by Founders Fund, an early Oculus investor.[7] Luckey met Trae Stephens, 30, who had recently been persuaded to leave Palantir and join Founders Fund by its leader, Peter Thiel.[7] Luckey and Stephens discovered a shared interest in seeking defense contracts for companies built like tech startups.[8] \"Stephens found it ridiculous that almost no venture-backed companies worked closely with the government; with its billions of dollars to spend\", aside from Palantir and SpaceX. Founders Fund was also an early SpaceX investor. \"Stephens' goal was to fund a company to join that duo\", but found it difficult to accomplish in Silicon Valley.[7]\n\nIn 2015, the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security opened Silicon Valley offices. \"In 2017, as part of an initiative that had begun the previous year, the Defense Department unveiled the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team, known as Project Maven, to harness the latest AI research into battlefield technology, starting with a project to improve image recognition for drones operating in the Middle East.\"[8]\n\nThe idea for a software startup focused on \"high-tech\" military applications was raised by Stephens and some of his colleagues at Palantir.[9][10] After the 2016 presidential election, Stephens was appointed to the Defense transition team and later joined the Defense Innovation Board, a \"central part\" of Carter's effort.[9] Stephens, who was also looking for a defense startup Founders Fund could invest in, began to recruit employees for Anduril alongside Luckey, who was looking to make use of the money he obtained from selling Oculus VR to Facebook in 2014 for $2 billion.[9]\n\nLuckey left Facebook in March 2017, alleging he had been fired for his pro-Trump beliefs, which Facebook denies.[9][11] Stephens and Luckey recruited employees from Palantir and Oculus, and planned to employ Luckey's developmental approach with the Oculus headset to combine low-cost hardware components with sophisticated software. Luckey thought this would be easy because, he said, \"the defense industry has been stagnant for decades\".[9]\n\nSince 2017\n\n[edit]\n\nAnduril was incorporated in June 2017[12] and seeded by Founders Fund.[10] There were at least four founders: Stephens, Luckey, Matt Grimm, and Joe Chen.[7] Brian Singerman led a seed funding round.[7] Luckey, Stephens, and Grimm pitched their company to the directors of Palantir. One of them, Brian Schimpf, decided to join, and became the fifth co-founder (and CEO).\"[7]\n\nIn June 2017, Anduril executives contacted the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) California office to pitch low-cost border security. The DHS introduced them to border officials. The San Diego Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) office eventually paid Anduril to test a new border system.[7]\n\nIn June 2018, Lattice surveillance towers were informally tested on a Texas rancher's private land. Lattice was operated remotely by an Anduril technician.[7] CBP worked on pilot programs with Anduril in Texas and San Diego.[13]\n\nIn June 2019, the UK Royal Navy purchased Lattice as part of a modernization initiative.[14][15] Anduril also signed a contract with the Royal Marines.[16] In 2019, advocacy group Mijente reported a $13.5 million Marine Corps contract to install Anduril systems at military bases in Japan and the United States, including one that abuts the U.S.-Mexico border.[16] In 2019, more towers were installed in CBP's San Diego sector. CBP ordered more for Texas, and started a pilot program at Montana and Vermont border sites for a cold-weather variant.[13] In a September 2019 funding round, Anduril secured US$120M in funding from various venture capital firms, including Founders Fund, General Catalyst, and Andreessen Horowitz. The company was valued at over US$1 billion at the time, a four-fold increase from its 2018 valuation.[9]\n\nIn July 2020, Anduril received $200M in funding from venture capital firms including Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund for U.S. military projects.[17] A company representative said the company's valuation increased to $2 billion.[17] The Post reported that Anduril had received around $28M for unclassified contracts, a small amount in the defense industry.[17] In July 2020, Anduril's annual revenue was estimated at $100M.[18] Also In July, CBP and Anduril entered a five-year $25M contract to deploy sentry towers for CBP.[19][18][20] In September, Anduril received another $36M from CBP for surveillance towers. CBP planned to install 200 towers by 2022.[21] In October, Google began integrating Google Cloud technology with Anduril technology to help AI implementations by CBP's Innovation Team.[22] In 2020, Anduril was one of more than 50 companies selected by the U.S. Air Force to help develop the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) [13] under a contract worth up to $950 million.[23][24]\n\nIn February 2021, The Times reported that the Royal Marines had been testing Anduril's Ghost drone to provide video of targets for frontline use.[25] In April, Anduril acquired Area-I, a company producing drones capable of being launched from larger aircraft. Area-I had previously contracted for U.S. government agencies including the Army, Air Force, Navy, and NASA.[26] Area-I was an Atlanta-based technology startup, which developed surveillance drones for government clients. It was founded by aerospace researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and was funded largely through government contracts including SBIR.[27] In June, Anduril announced $450M in Series D funding from Andreessen Horowitz, 8VC, Founders Fund, General Catalyst, Lux Capital, Valor Equity Partners, and D1 Capital Partners. This increased their valuation to $4.6bn, double that of July 2020.[28] The funding round was led by investor and entrepreneur Elad Gil.[26] In July, the BBC reported that the Royal Navy had used Ghost drones in an autonomous drone test to provide live feeds of targets.[29]\n\nIn June 2023, Anduril acquired rocket engine company Adranos, giving the company access to technology for developing solid rocket motors for missiles and space launch.[30] In September 2023, Anduril acquired North Carolina-based autonomous aircraft developer, Blue Force Technologies.[31] In September 2023, Anduril engineers tested a live warhead on the Altius-700M. Anduril said that the \"system was accurate and effective against the chosen target\".[32]\n\nIn January 2024, Anduril was one of five vendors contracted by the US Air Force for the development of collaborative combat aircraft.[33] In April 2024, the U.S. Army Defense Innovation Unit selected Anduril to develop a software framework, for robotic combat vehicle payloads.[34] In August Anduril raised $1.5 billion in series F funding led by Founders Fund and Sands Capital, valuing the company at $14bn. The proceeds were to establish manufacturing facilities for autonomous weapons systems.[35][36]\n\nOn July 12, 2024, Anduril and its executives were sanctioned by the Chinese government due to arms sales over Taiwan.[37]\n\nProducts\n\n[edit]\n\nAltius\n\n[edit]\n\nAltius (Agile Launched, Tactically-Integrated Unmanned System)[38] is a series of fixed-wing, tube-launched unmanned aerial vehicles developed by Area-I, an Atlanta-based subsidiary that Anduril acquired in April 2021. Altius 600 accepts a modular payload on the nose. It can be launched from different launchers and platforms, including C-130 aircraft, UH-60 Blackhawks, and various ground vehicles, as well as larger UAVs, including the MQ-1C Grey Eagle and Kratos XQ-58 Valkyrie stealth UCAV.\n\nThe Altius is a component of the U.S. Army's Air-Launched Effects (ALE). Swarms can operate in a mesh network.[39][40] The Altius is designed to be low-cost and expendable, but can be recovered mid-flight with Flying Air Recovery System (FLARES).[41] The loitering munition version of Altius has a range of 280 miles (450 km) and four hours flying time.[42]\n\nAnvil\n\n[edit]\n\nAnvil, also known as Interceptor,[a] is an unmanned combat aerial vehicle quadcopter designed principally to attack other unmanned aerial vehicles.[44] After launch, Anvil locates target drones using computer vision,[46] and can be commanded to ram targets by its operator.[9] The drone reportedly can reach speeds of up to 200 mph (320 km/h). Anduril is developing versions to attack larger targets such as helicopters or cruise missiles.[9] Anvil can be integrated into Anduril's Lattice system.[18]\n\nThe interceptor was conceptualized over a weekend, as a drone that could identify and ram hostile objects.[9] After sending a video to the Pentagon of a working prototype, the U.S. military made a small order for testing.[9] Anduril publicly announced the drone in October 2019.[48]\n\nAs of 2019, Anduril had delivered the Anvil to the United States and United Kingdom militaries. Anduril was contracted to deploy the drone to overseas combat zones.[9]\n\nA detonating version called the Anvil-M was unveiled in October 2023. It uses a fire-control module and munitions payload to destroy Group 1 and 2 UAS.[49]\n\nBarracuda\n\n[edit]\n\nBarracuda is a family of low cost air launched cruise missiles.[50]\n\nBolt/Bolt-M\n\n[edit]\n\nBolt is a 12 lb (5.4 kg) UAV that comes in military and civilian configurations. M stands for \"munitions\". The products operate on the Lattice AI network. They can be carried in a backpack and can be deployed in five minutes. It includes swappable batteries for extending flight time. Its primary purpose is intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and search and rescue (SAR). It has both remote and autonomous flight modes. Flight time is 45 minutes. Range is 12.4 mi (20.0 km). The operator can specify a target, and an attack angle, and then let the drone operate autonomously without further intervention.[51]\n\nBolt-M carries up to a 3 lb (1.4 kg) ordnance payload. It supports both anti-personnel or anti-materiel warheads. The additional weight reduces flight time to 40 minutes.[51]\n\nDive-LD\n\n[edit]\n\nDive-LD is an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) designed by Boston-based Dive Technologies, which was acquired by Anduril in February 2022.[52] It is intended for use in littoral and deep-water survey, inspection, and ISR.[53] In May 2022, Anduril announced that the Royal Australian Navy signed a $100M contract to develop and build three Extra Large Autonomous Undersea Vehicles (XL-AUVs).[54]\n\nDust\n\n[edit]\n\nDust is a small 4-pound (1.8 kg) ground-based sensor designed to detect people and objects in areas with limited line of sight, such as small corridors that nearby Sentry Towers cannot observe. Dust is powered by an onboard battery providing two months of life, or an external solar panel.[55]\n\nFury\n\n[edit]\n\nFury is a long-range, subsonic, stealthy military drone with 17-foot (5.2 m) wingspan suited for surveillance and combat.[31][56] It was originally made by Blue Force Technologies. Fury was selected alongside General Atomics to compete for the first increment of the U.S. Air Force's Collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) program in April 2024.[57]\n\nGhost\n\n[edit]\n\nGhost is an unmanned aerial vehicle.[b] The name signals its reportedly quiet acoustic signature and ability to avoid detection.[25] Ghosts 1, 2, and 3 have been used in military operations. Information about them has not been publicly released.[5]\n\nGhost 4 was announced in September 2020.[58] Constructed using metal alloys and carbon fiber composites,[25] it utilizes a traditional single-rotor helicopter design, which reduces noise, increases efficiency and payload compared to a multirotor design.[5] It measures 2.725 m (8 ft 11.3 in) long when fully assembled. It can be collapsed to 1.07 m (3 ft 6 in) for transport in a backpack.[59][25] Anduril claims a maximum flight time of 100 minutes, a cruise speed of 52 knots (60 mph; 96 km/h), a 35-pound (16 kg) payload capacity, and a charge time of 35 minutes.[5][60] The drone can be remotely or autonomously piloted.[5]\n\nMachine learning and computer vision algorithms are used to identify and track targets.[3][25][60] The drone can upload data to Anduril's Lattice system.[5] The drone uses Nvidia processing units originally designed for self-driving cars.[60] The drone was designed to use on-board processing chips, due to bandwidth limitations for communication links, and to enable radio silence, by processing imagery independently without the need for a centralized analysis system that requires communication.[60] An onboard camera provides a live feed for operators.[25] Luckey claims it can track and image, in high-resolution, objects up to 2,520 feet (770 m) away.[c]\n\nGhost can perform multiple roles due to its five modular payload bays,[60] such as utilizing laser weapons or detecting and tracking cruise missiles.[5] Anduril claims that payloads can be swapped out in minutes.[60] Multiple Ghosts can reportedly link up, using a conventional rule-based system to form a 'swarm', to relay data amongst themselves to increase effective range to a Lattice station.[3] Ghost 4 features improved weatherproofing.[5][60] Its rotor system was also overhauled.[60]\n\nUsers of previous Ghost iterations include the United States Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection.[5] The United States Department of Defense and the Ministry of Defence used Ghost 3.[60] The Royal Navy tested Ghost for use on the frontline.[25] The U.S. Army selected the Ghost X in September 2024 to fulfil the first tranche of the Company-Level Small UAS Directed Requirement; the Ghost X has a flight time of 75 minutes and a range of 25 km (16 mi).[61][62][63]\n\nGhost Shark\n\n[edit]\n\nGhost Shark is an autonomous submarine developed by Anduril Industries. Anduril contracted with the Royal Australian Navy and the Defence Science and Technology Group in May 2022 to produce three prototypes over three years.[64]\n\nIt is intended for a design that is suitable for manufacturing to be ready by mid-2025.[65] As of April 2024, prototype testing was underway, with Anduril officials reporting that the vehicle had already spent significant time at sea. While specific technical details remain undisclosed, the project emphasizes rapid development and scalability for potential large-scale production.[65]\n\nLattice\n\n[edit]\n\nLattice is a software platform[16][5] that uses artificial intelligence[19] to classify objects by fusing data from disparate sensors, including Anduril platforms[5][16][46] and those of third parties.[66] Lattice has been used to control Anduril equipment for national border and military base surveillance.[66][16]\n\nAnduril demonstrated Lattice in a September 2020 exercise, simulating shooting down Russian cruise missiles in the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, as part of the United States Air Force's Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) program, which aims to reduce response time delays after initial data acquisition.[66] During that exercise, Lattice ingested data from Air Force systems and missile detection towers to track potential missiles and alert users. The system displayed a map of the area in an Oculus virtual reality headset.[66] Users could tag the missile as hostile, triggering Lattice to offer potential response options.[66]\n\nMilitary clients access the system using a laptop or phone.[5]\n\nRoadrunner\n\n[edit]\n\nRoadrunner is a 6 ft (1.8 m)-long twin turbojet-powered delta-winged craft capable of high subsonic speeds and extreme maneuverability. Company officials describe it as somewhere between an autonomous drone and a reusable missile. The basic version can be fitted with modular payloads such as intelligence and reconnaissance sensors. The Roadrunner-M has an explosive warhead to intercept UAS, cruise missiles, and manned aircraft. Both models can take off and land vertically from a dedicated container, and the munition version can be recovered if not detonated. Although specifications are not public, it is purported to have three times the warhead payload, three times the maneuverability under g-forces, and 10 times the one-way range of comparable air vehicles.[67][68][69][70][71]\n\nAnduril revealed the Roadrunner in December 2023, saying that it had been in development for two years, and that they were about to begin low-rate production for an order of \"hundreds of units\" from a U.S. customer. A single unit costs \"in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars\" but the price is expected to drop as volumes increase. The name came from its competitor, RTX Corporation's Coyote Block 2, in reference to the Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner cartoon characters.[67][68][69][71]\n\nSentry Tower\n\n[edit]\n\nSentry Tower is a 33-foot (10 m) tall[72] solar-powered portable surveillance tower.[17][19] Sentry contains a camera, communications antennae, radar, and thermal imaging.[19][7][73] The tower operates autonomously,[73] and feeds data into Lattice.[19][18][74] When disassembled, Sentry can fit into a pickup truck, and reportedly can be re-assembled in under an hour.[7] CBP says agents can set up an individual system in under 2 hours.[19] Sentry Tower and associated systems such as Lattice have been referred to as a \"virtual border wall,\" a more sustainable and economical alternative to a fixed border wall.[75][74][76] or \"smart wall\".[77][78][19]\n\nThe U.S. government has been seeking digital border security tools since the 1990s. It spent $429M on two unsuccessful development programs from 1997 to 2005.[77] The DHS SBinet program started in the mid-2000s with the goal of creating a border wall. Boeing won the contract in September 2006 for an estimated $7.6B.[7] The system was rolled out along the Arizona border, but expansion was later halted.[77] Plagued with cost overruns, missed deadlines, and other issues, the program was canceled in 2011 after spending over $1 billion.[77] The fault was partly pursuing a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, versus implementing systems for local requirements.[77] Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems had developed camera towers, but its equipment was considered more expensive and less mobile than Anduril's. Sentry Tower's smaller footprint mitigated land-use issues.[7]\n\nAnduril's pitch deck to its initial investors included 'perimeter security on a pole'. While Stephens was interested in developing the product for forward operating bases, Luckey thought it could be useable as border security.[7] Anduril executives contacted a DHS office in California in June 2017, which put them in contact with border-patrol agents.[7] Anduril quickly produced a prototype.[7] Schimpf and other employees took the prototype to a test range.[7] They trained software on open-source machine learning training datasets, to identify and distinguish humans from other objects.[7]\n\nTo image distant targets, Luckey proposed an off-the-shelf infrared laser repurposed from a hair removal device as an illumination source in a manner akin to a photographic flash, allowing Sentry Tower to capture high resolution images of distant targets.[7] This was considered a cheaper alternative to using a thermal camera.[7]\n\nStephens called U.S. representative Will Hurd (R-TX),[79] who helped arrange an informal test of three towers in early 2018 on ranch land near the border.[7] The towers led to 55 arrests and 982 lb (445 kg) of marijuana seized within 10 weeks of installation. An official test outside San Diego led to 10 interceptions within 12 days.[7]\n\nAnduril received Sentry Tower contracts from several U.S. agencies:\n\nCBP: Started in early 2018 with 4 towers in San Diego County.[72][80][18] They had 60 in operation in June 2020.[18][80]\n\n2019: A pilot program in Montana/Vermont for \"cold-weather tower variant\"[13] and other border surveillance equipment.[81]\n\nIn July 2020, CBP paid $25M for surveillance towers. In September 2020, Anduril received $36M from CBP for Sentry Towers.[21][19]\n\nMarines: The US Marine Corps inked a July 15, 2019 $13.5M contract for Lattice/towers at 4 bases sited at Smedley D. Butler in Okinanawa, Japan; Marine Corps Base Hawaii; Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in Arizona; and Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Japan.[81]\n\nJuly 2020: A DHS contract to expand its virtual border wall program, including Anduril towers, worth up to $250m overall.[82]\n\nSentry (firefighting vehicle)\n\n[edit]\n\nSentry was proposed as an autonomous firefighting vehicle, which would repurpose an armored personnel carrier to carry water.[7] The vehicle was developed in Oakland, California by special effects expert and former MythBusters co-host Jamie Hyneman, who subcontracted to Anduril.[7]\n\nMilitary programs\n\n[edit]\n\nAdvanced Battle Management System / Joint All-Domain Command & Control\n\n[edit]\n\nABMS is a digital architecture battlefield management system, designed to connect data across a variety of sources and weapons,[83] including \"jets, drones, ships and soldiers\"[84] The task is difficult due to the lack of data interoperability. For example, the F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters were designed with incompatible tactical datalinks.[84] ABMS is part of Pentagon's Joint All-Domain Command & Control (JADC2), which aims to network all military assets[13] into a single data-sharing infrastructure.[83]\n\nIntegrated Visual Augmentation System\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Integrated Visual Augmentation System\n\nOn February 11, 2025, Anduril took over the development and production of Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) from Microsoft for the U.S. Department of Defense. The Army planned to order as many as 121,000 of the devices but said the goggles had to pass high-stress operational combat tests later in the year before full production would occur.[85]\n\nProject Maven\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Project Maven\n\nProject Maven is an initiative that started in 2018 intended to adapt AI for military purposes.[8]\n\nCorporate affairs\n\n[edit]\n\nDevelopment ethos\n\n[edit]\n\nLuckey aims to replicate a high-tech startup in the traditionally slower-pace defense industry.[5] Anduril has a stated goal of helping to modernize the militaries of US and its allies, in the face of \"strategic adversaries\", including Russia and China.[5]\n\nAccording to Wired, Anduril uses Silicon Valley-style development schemes, pre-emptively developing products for potential military markets before the Pentagon has expressed a request to purchase them.[3] The company attempts to use commercial technologies such as AI and VR for faster iteration.[3][12]\n\nMilitary relations\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to Stevens, Anduril's chairman, the company is upfront about its military connections and weapons development, unlike other technology companies which seek to downplay their military involvement.[9] The company has \"unapologetically\" expressed its mission, where its engineers are \"openly interested\" in supporting the U.S. military.[16]\n\nThiel claimed that tech companies should work with the U.S. Government, and less with its rivals, stating that the U.S. was behind in deploying new technologies.[16] Luckey said that he trusts the U.S. government and military to obey their ethical guidelines.\"[16]\n\nFunding\n\n[edit]\n\nUnlike most defense firms, Anduril has significant support from venture capital, totaling over $2 billion. Investors include Founders Fund, General Catalyst, Andreessen Horowitz,[9] 8VC, Lux Capital, Valor Equity Partners, Elad Gil, and D1 Capital Partners.[16][28]\n\nThe company has signed contracts with multiple US and UK government agencies, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars.[17][18]\n\nPolitical affiliations\n\n[edit]\n\nAnduril helped provide data/analysis for U.S. House Representative Will Hurd to introduce the \"Secure Miles with All Resources and Technology Act\" bill in the 2017 House session, whose purpose was to fund the development of surveillance equipment to monitor the US-Mexico border.[78]\n\nLocations\n\n[edit]\n\nAnduril is headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, with satellite offices in Boston, Atlanta, Seattle, Washington, D.C., London, and Sydney. The company chose to base itself in Irvine due to its proximity to military bases and to stay away from Silicon Valley, which has been more cautious about working for the military.[10] According to COO Grimm, Anduril's work requires in-person interaction. The company must use industrial equipment to build their products, has security requirements for classified contracts, and supplies in-person demonstrations for potential clients.[82]\n\nIn July 2018, Anduril leased a 155,000 sq ft (14,400 m2) building next to John Wayne Airport, near Irvine.[86] In February 2021, Anduril leased a 640,000 sq ft (59,000 m2) campus in Costa Mesa, California.[82] It is called \"The Press\" by the company, after its original occupant, the Orange County bureau and printing press of the Los Angeles Times, starting in 1968.[82]\n\nThe Press hosts a rail line and a gas station, destined to become a company park and coffee shop, respectively. The complex is 450,000 sq ft (42,000 m2). A 190,000 sq ft (18,000 m2) westward expansion is intended as Anduril's research and development hub and a parking garage. Two floors will be added inside part of the existing complex. The redesign/expansion was expected to cost US$200M. Anduril planned to occupy its Costa Mesa location in 2022.[d] The lease was the largest by size in Costa Mesa's history and the largest in Orange County's since 2006.[82]\n\nThe company operates a testing range near Camp Pendleton.[10]\n\nEmployment\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2019, Anduril had around 90 employees.[87] By February 2021, around 400 employees were at its headquarters and satellite offices.[82]\n\nCriticism and controversies\n\n[edit]\n\nAnduril has been called \"Tech's Most Controversial Startup.\"[9] Autonomous weapons have stirred controversy, but Anduril courts business from the government and military.[10]\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection's use of Anduril's sentry towers has been criticized by the ACLU and other human rights and immigration activists for pushing migrants toward ever more dangerous routes, and normalizing surveillance near the border, among other negative impacts.[81][9][72][88]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nCompanies portal\n\nAviation portal\n\nUnited States portal",
      "# [Anduril's Fury hopes to woo Australia away from Boeing's Ghost Bat by Colin Clark on 2025-03-26](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/andurils-fury-hopes-to-woo-australia-away-from-boeings-ghost-bat/)\nAVALON AIR SHOW — Anduril is showcasing a model of its Fury drone at the Avalon Air Show this week, in what appears to be an attempt to woo Australia away from its focus on Boeing’s MQ-28 Ghost Bat Collaborative Combat Aircraft loyal wingman drone.\n\n“It’s a capability that we would like to think would be of interest to the Australian CCA program in terms of what Fury can do,” Anduril Australia CEO David Goodrich said in an interview with Breaking Defense, pointing to interest by the Australian military.\n\n“We have participated in a process that the Royal Australian Air Force has run. I probably can’t say much more than that. We’re waiting for some some feedback on that process. Obviously, it’s subject to government approvals. We’re not quite sure as to what the timetable for that is,” Goodrich said. “But it’s more than just conversations.”\n\nIn a statement sure to attract interest from the Australian government, the Anduril Australia executive said his company would be interested in building Fury in Australia should the CCA drone be purchased here.\n\nThe company has held talks with other countries in the Indo-Pacific theater, Goodrich said, though he declined to identify which nations the startup was talking to. One of them may be Singapore, given a March 20 announcement from Singapore’s Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) and Anduril that they have “established a partnership to explore advancements in mission autonomy for manned-unmanned teaming concepts.”\n\nRELATED: Australia’s Ghost Bat eyes live air-to-air weapons test by end of year\n\nAnduril clearly believes some customers outside of the Pacific are interested as well. Goodrich said the company will showcase Fury next at the Paris Air Show in June. The first flight for Fury is set for this year in the United States, where it is competing against General Atomics’ entrant in the CCA competition to fly with the Next Generation Air Dominance Fighter, the contract for which was just awarded to Boeing. With the contract award, NGAD is now known as the F-47.\n\nThe seeming target of Anduril’s marketing efforts is the Ghost Bat, a weapon designed by Boeing Australia specifically for the military. Australia has budgeted $600 million AUD ($377 million USD) for 10 Ghost Bats, while another $400 million AUD ($260 million USD) is allocated for three Block 2 upgraded Ghost Bats.\n\nA regional defense expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), Malcolm Davis, said Fury’s debut in the Lucky Country — which developed Ghost Bat, a Boeing drone formerly known as the Loyal Wingman —- “certainly will put some heat on Boeing.”\n\nDavis questioned “whether Boeing can produce MQ-28 Ghost Bat at a similar cost to what Anduril are suggesting for Fury — which I doubt.”\n\nAs a cost contrast, Fury’s airframe uses large amounts of commercial technology, combined with Anduril’s autonomy software, which is also largely commercial. For example, Fury uses a commercial jet engine, according to Anduril. Former Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall estimated each CCA aircraft, would cost $25 million to $30 million.\n\nWhen asked about Fury and and its impact on Ghost Bat, Boeing executive Steve Parker, who is interim CEO of the company’s defense, space and security unit, said a number of competitors are entering the market and noted that Ghost Bat has already flown 100 times, as opposed to challengers who are still in the early R&D phase.\n\nAlso seemingly unperturbed by Anduril’s showcasing Fury at Avalon is its chief rival for the US Air Force’s CCA program, General Atomics. GA spokesperson C. Mark Brinkley told Breaking Defense that the firm isn’t looking at Ghost Bat as a target, but instead is here trying to cast a larger, regional net for customers.\n\n“I mean for CCA in Australia, if Ghost Bat meets their needs then it meets their needs,” Brinkley said.\n\nHowever, he did claim that GA is capable of producing 200 or more aircraft each year without building any new facilities or hiring new employees, a not so veiled shot at Anduril’s relatively light footprint.",
      "# [Marines to lean on Anduril tech to protect bases from drones by Jon Harper on 2025-03-13](https://defensescoop.com/2025/03/13/marine-corps-anduril-contract-defend-installations-small-uas-drones/)\nThe Marine Corps, gung-ho on technology that can shield its forces from enemy drones, is planning to acquire a slew of AI-enabled systems from Anduril to protect the service’s installations.\n\nCommanders at U.S. military bases are already seeing large numbers of incursions by small unmanned aerial systems. And those types of threats are expected to increase.\n\n“We must continue to capture the lessons being learned in blood on active battlefields from Ukraine to the Middle East. We should pay special attention to the increasing importance of … the proliferation and effectiveness of drones,” Marine Commandant Gen. Eric Smith wrote in planning guidance issued last year. “We will continue to experiment with and invest in burgeoning capabilities that are defining the modern battlefield such as Ground Based Air Defenses, including Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems.”\n\nIn early 2024, the Corps released a solicitation for Installation-Counter Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (I-CsUAS). A few days ago, the Pentagon announced that Anduril beat out nine other offerors and snagged an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract worth a whopping $642 million to deliver, install and sustain a family of systems between now and March 2035.\n\n“What they’ve selected here is not just a capability that is going to set them up for a future, but something that can deliver real capability to them today,” Kyle Erickson, general manager of air defense at Anduril, told DefenseScoop in an interview Thursday. “Our family of systems is deployed at scale with multiple services at multiple locations around the world. Has been in service for many years. It is proven, it is real, it’s in production. And so they’re picking something that is going to deliver value to them immediately.”\n\nThe contractor expects to field capabilities this year.\n\nErickson noted that the company has already provided a similar capability to U.S. Special Operations Command.\n\nThe family of systems that the Marine Corps will get under the new contract includes a variety of sensors and weapons to detect, identify, track and take down small UAS.\n\nErickson noted that Anduril will provide “an end-to-end capability” across the entire “kill chain,” to include all the fielding and sustainment support services.\n\n“I can’t get into what we’re specifically going to provide for a specific installation in a given circumstance. Part of that is just due to the sensitivity of it, but partially also because different installations will have different priorities or threat profiles. And so I can’t talk about the specific case, but in the general case, you know the Marine Corps here is going to have access to our full family of systems, which includes multi-sensor detect, track, ID capability, including the radar and narrow-field-of-view infrared imaging capability in our Long Range Sensor Towers, the wide area infrared sensing with persistence in the Wisp sensor, as well as radio frequency sensing with the Pulsar capability and multiple defeat options, including low-collateral interceptors, like our Anvil interceptor, as well as the [electronic warfare] capabilities of the Pulsar,” he said. “So across that family of systems, you get multiple sensing modalities, multiple defeat or deter options to deploy flexibly depending on the threat profile or the authorities in a given situation.”\n\nThe company’s AI-enabled software platform, called Lattice, will be the centerpiece of the drone-killing architecture.\n\n“Lattice is the software that stitches all this capability together. So it’s providing that command-and-control interface to the end users or operators so that they can command and control all the assets at a given installation from a single pane of glass. It’s also providing the autonomy capabilities on the different products themselves, so providing all the kinds of automated threat identification, sensor fusion, tracking — all the kinds of autonomy capabilities that help our operators to progress through the kill chain much more quickly and reduce the burden on them,” Erickson told DefenseScoop.\n\nAnduril is taking a “software-first” approach to its family of systems, he said, which will facilitate future upgrades to the capabilities as new technologies become available.\n\nDrone threat identification can vary depending on the sensor modality, Erickson noted.\n\n“You might do some track classification based on the kinematics of a radar track, for example, the different characteristics of that track as measured by the radar with something like a narrow-field-of-view optic. Yu can run computer vision algorithms on the imagery and train those over time as you see more data with a radio frequency sensor. As you can imagine, you can do some amount of identification based on the particular signal and the analysis of that signal,” he explained. “And when you have these multiple modalities layered in together, then you have much greater capability of identifying threats.”\n\nWhile autonomy is a key element of the capability set, Erickson said there is room for a human in the loop, which is important to the Marine Corps.\n\n“The autonomy is really designed to invite the user at key decision points through the kill chain process. So the autonomy is doing a lot of the initial detection, tracking and identification. When a threat is identified, the end user is notified and alerted. They then have an opportunity to make a decision about what to do, whether that’s making a phone call or working through their [standard operating procedures], or even tasking an integrated effector against the threat. So there’s not going to be 100 percent automated, full execution of the kill chain — and that’s very much by design. You know our customers want to have a human operator on the loop for these critical decision points, and that’s a key element in our design approach as well,” he noted.\n\nThe $642 million I-CsUAS contract is focused on addressing threats posed by Group 1 and Group 2 drones — which are on the smaller end of the UAS spectrum — but Anduril also has capabilities that can defeat Group 3 systems, Erickson said.\n\nKamikaze drones, also known as one-way attack drones or loitering munitions, typically fall into the Group 3 category, and they’re a type of weapon that the Marines and the U.S. military writ large are concerned about and want to counter.",
