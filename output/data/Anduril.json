      "# [Lattice SDK core concepts](https://docs.anduril.com/guide/concepts)\nThis page covers core concepts and use cases for building with the Lattice SDK™.\n\nSince its founding, Anduril has excelled in building integrated systems that function reliably in austere and even hostile environments. Anduril's first Sentry Towers performed key workloads such as computer vision and sensor fusion locally at the edge in order to automatically triage suspected threats from the environment, independent of a human operator. As we introduced new products such as Anvil, we continued to push processing and collaboration to the edge, rather than centralize logic on data center servers.\n\nThis local-first DNA is embodied in all of Anduril's products, and the networking and autonomy technologies which Anduril has built to achieve integration and collaboration among these local-first products form the backbone of Anduril’s differentiated capability. We call this backbone Lattice, and this SDK is meant to help accelerate your ability to quickly build decentralized applications that can deploy and interoperate with other systems on the mesh.\n\nAs you build your solution, we recommend adopting the following core principles to ensure your application can operate successfully on the mesh:\n\nLocal-First Design - A network connection can not be assumed to be constant nor abundant. In order to deliver applications that perform well in a degradable mesh network environment, developers should be highly responsible with bandwidth utilization and build in the assumption that the network may be spotty or fail on a regular basis. For the best experience, we recommend designing with network failure in mind.\n\nData Exchange through Open Data Models - In order for our systems to interoperate they must speak the same language. Anduril has standardized key data models which are utilized across all of Anduril's products and applications.\n\nWe believe embracing these two simple principles allow our teams to move quickly and independently, without sacrificing our ability to deliver integrated solutions. This approach fosters interoperability without requiring high levels of prior coordination. As long as teams adhere to standard data models and build systems that can work in local, disconnected environments, bringing them together can be a simple process.\n\nWe believe in this model so strongly that we’re publishing this framework as the Lattice SDK which supports developers in building decentralized and interoperable solutions.\n\nWith the Lattice SDK and its open data models, Anduril allows every bespoke data system and hardware platform to become general purpose to the extent it integrates with a large and growing set of networked, data-centric applications and physical systems at the tactical edge.\n\nThe Lattice SDK documents and implements two foundational structured data models:\n\nAn entity is the representation of anything in the world that is significant as an aspect of situational awareness. Examples of entities include assets clearly emitting their well known location such as aircraft or ground vehicles as well as estimated positions of radio emitters. For more information, see Entities overview.\n\nA task models a command to a networked actor to perform some useful action. Actors are as diverse as robotic vehicles, electronic sensor systems, and manned platforms. Tasks may command effects-oriented actions, provide sensing priorities, trigger configuration changes, and more.\n\nBy implementing both a local-first architecture and specific data models such as entity and task, developers are able to quickly deliver new, innovative value alongside complementary and synergistic solutions in a common data mesh.",

      "# [Build with Lattice](https://docs.anduril.com/entity/overview)\nThis overview describes entities, the entity data model's components, and how Entity Manager supports distributed entity management.\n\nAn entity is an interoperable data structure that powers a common operational picture (COP). A COP provides human and machine consumers with a shared view of the current state of the modeled world, which enhances situational awareness and facilitates decision-making.\n\nEntities represent any type of known object that can be referenced or commanded.\n\nEntities can be tangible or intangible, including:\n\nPhysical objects, such as vessels or drones.\n\nNon-physical objects, such as signal detections.\n\nVisual concepts, such as bounding boxes or control zones.\n\nAlthough there is no strict type hierarchy, a user interface could group entities according to its ontology.template component. The three top-level groupings are track, asset, and geo-entity.\n\nTracks: any contact not directly under the control of friendly forces. This can include aircraft tracks generated from radar or sensor hits, signal detections, vehicles or people detected through cameras, or any other contact source.\n\nTracks include all entities with the following template types:\n\nTrack: An object detection.\n\nSensor point of interest: A sensor detection at a specific location.\n\nSignal of interest: A signal detection with characteristics such as emitter notation, frequency, or lines of bearing.\n\nExamples include:\n\nAn aircraft reporting its information using an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) transponder.\n\nA surface vessel reporting its information using an Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponder.\n\nA person detected by computer vision processing of camera images from a tower.\n\nA signal detection with an estimated area and error ellipse.\n\nAssets: entities directly under your control that generally can accept tasks from the operator. Examples include Anduril towers, Dive, and so on.\n\nGeo-entities: shapes or points of interest drawn on the map. They might not physically exist in the world. A geo-entity could be a point representing an airfield or a control zone meant to constrain operations of an autonomous vehicle. Examples include:\n\nA point of interest on the map manually created by one operator to share with other operators.\n\nA zone around a training area.\n\nA keep-out-zone on the map indicating an area where a hurricane develops.\n\nThe entity data model is the canonical data model that represents all objects in the COP. It represents the known state of the world in Lattice, providing a common language to describe any object or concept that can enhance an operator's situational awareness.\n\nThe entity data model consists of different fields called components.\n\nThe entity data model observes these principles:\n\nComponents are optional, except those listed in Customize entities.\n\nComponents mustn't be duplicative. Avoid modeling the same underlying data on two different components.\n\nComponents are non-hierarchical. The data model is composable and not an inheritance tree.\n\nFor the full list of possible entity components, refer to the canonical entity data model.\n\nThe data model is based on the entity component system architecture and favors composition over inheritance. The presence or absence of components—rather than a strict type hierarchy—determines what an entity is or how it should be interacted with. Think of an entity as a bag of components that can be mixed and matched as needed.\n\nEntity consumers key off specific components to decide how to process the entity. When producing an entity, only include components that are relevant to the entity you're modeling, along with the required components.\n\nFor example, to model a track you should include:\n\nA location to render the track on the map.\n\nAn ontology to specify which icon type to render in Lattice UI.\n\nA sensors component if the track has sensors. Downstream consumers that perform actions on sensors will behave correctly based on the presence of this component in your entity.\n\nBecause an entity is a collection of components, entities can sometimes be in incomplete states. An incomplete state means the entity is missing some expected components or values. This is a reasonable condition for situational awareness data in a COP, which is an aggregation of real-time, known data.\n\nIn some cases, the producers pushing data may not have the full picture yet. There's still value in distributing this partial state for situational awareness purposes. Therefore, it's important for services consuming entities to be robust against missing components.\n\nEntity Manager is the backend Lattice service that powers the COP. Once an entity is available in the COP, operators can use it for other Lattice services, such as tasking or creating alerts.\n\nEntity Manager provides a real-time, distributed COP:\n\nReal-time: Entity Manager provides the current state of the COP by publishing entity events that follow the entity lifecycle of create, update, or delete. Entity Manager doesn't provide historical data.\n\nDistributed: A layer on top of Lattice's mesh network, Entity Manager supports distributed entity management. Entity Manager instances in a mesh network can send entities to or receive entities from another Entity Manager instance in the mesh. The COP eventually becomes consistent between nodes, which store files, entities, and tasks in the Lattice system; each COP's view converges, subject to operator controls.\n\nEntities have a well-defined lifecycle of create, update, and delete. On each lifecycle state change, Entity Manager emits the state change event to the COP using the StreamEntityComponents call (gRPC | HTTP).\n\nCreate: When an entity first appears or re-appears after expiring, the entity is created.\n\nUpdate: When data in the entity changes, Entity Manager emits the state change as an update event. Note that, for performance reasons, Entity Manager relies on changes to the provenance.source_update_time to trigger an update event. It does not perform a full proto diff to the provenance.source_update_time component to trigger an update event.\n\nDelete: An entity is deleted when its expiry_time has passed or an update is sent with the is_live component set to false. You should handle a delete event by removing all references to it in memory or discarding it from your user interface.\n\nOn each lifecycle state change, the Entities API emits state change events via StreamEntityComponents (gRPC | HTTP).\n\nIt's the integration's responsibility to control an entity's lifecycle by sending updates and setting expiry times as needed.\n\nIn the Lattice ecosystem, integrations produce entities, achieved by publishing pre-populated entity objects to Lattice using the Entity Manager service gRPCs or HTTP SDKs.\n\nThe Entity Manager API provides the PublishEntity RPC to create or update entities. When beginning to integrate with Lattice, we recommend using this unary RPC because it provides validates its input and provides an immediate error response if the entity is malformed. It is also capable of high throughput. Exact numbers will vary greatly depending on the Lattice hardware you are integrating with.\n\nIf waiting for a unary response causes your publish task to fall behind, we also offer the PublishEntities gRPC client-streaming API to publish entities to Lattice. There are some tradeoffs to consider when deciding to use the client-streaming RPC:\n\nYou can achieve higher throughput because your publish task does not need to wait for a response from the server.\n\nYou may lose data if your stream connection with the server is terminated early. In most gRPC streaming implementations, outgoing messages are buffered locally prior to being sent over the wire. If the connection is terminated then all buffered messages are lost.\n\nYou will receive no feedback from the server regarding validity of the entity messages you publish.\n\nIntegrations can also consume entities from Lattice by streaming the COP from the Entity Manager API through the StreamEntityComponents endpoints (gRPC | HTTP).\n\nIn Lattice Mesh, the Lattice SDK can distribute entities between different Lattice nodes. Integrations only need to publish entities to their local Lattice node; Lattice Mesh takes care of sharing those entities with other Lattice nodes in the mesh network.\n\nLattice administrators have fine-grained control over this distribution. They can choose which Lattice nodes to distribute entities to by applying filters on a select majority of components in the entity data model.\n\nCertain fields on the entity data model are annotated as overridable. Overrides enable a user or system to change the value of a component on an entity that exists in the COP. The user or system that creates the override doesn't have to be the original producer of the entity.\n\nOverrides are distributed; an override created on one Lattice node will be visible on other Lattice nodes on the mesh.\n\nOperators or services generally use overrides when they have new or different information about an entity. For example, an operator might manually mark a track's disposition to hostile-based according to standard operating procedures (SOPs).\n\nThe entity data model includes a relationships property, which describes a predefined relationship type between two or more entities. Relationships provide the means for entities to reference other entities, enabling graph-like lookup capabilities for special processing.\n\nThe entity data model typically models relationships between entities when the existence of a relationship component triggers special treatment in the Lattice UI or for consuming services. For example, the Lattice UI can use these relationships to render the group and its members together.\n\nRelationships are distributed; a relationship created on one Lattice node in a mesh network appears on other nodes in the mesh network.",

      "# [Use the Lattice SDK for gRPC in Rust](https://docs.anduril.com/sdks/rust)\nThis page shows how you can install, set up, and use the Lattice SDK for gRPC in Rust to get information about an entity in your environment.\n\nClick to go to the gRPC SDK repository. By downloading and/or using, you agree to the terms of use. If you do not agree, do not use the SDK.\n\nLattice SDK for gRPC in Rust\n\nComplete the set up steps to generate a valid API bearer token and publish at least one entity to your environment.\n\nInstall the latest version of Rust. When you install Rust using rustup, you also get the latest version of Cargo. You can use Cargo to set up your project and manage dependencies.\n\nUse cargo to set up an example project. In the following steps, you'll replace the starter code with examples that let you connect with your Lattice environment.\n\nConfirm that you have Cargo installed:\n\ncargo--version\n\nCreate a new Rust project:\n\ncargo new $YOUR_PROJECT\n\nCargo creates a project folder consisting of a Cargo.toml to list versioned dependencies, and a main.rs file where you implement the main function for your program.\n\nNext, you'll replace the starter code.\n\nCopy and paste the following examples into your Rust project:\n\nmain.rs\n\nmain.rs\n\nusetonic::metadata::MetadataValue;\n\nusetonic::transport::ClientTlsConfig;\n\nusetonic::transport::Channel;\n\nusetonic::Status;\n\nusetonic::Request;\n\nuseanduril_lattice_sdk::anduril::entitymanager::v1::entity_manager_api_client::EntityManagerApiClient;\n\nuseanduril_lattice_sdk::anduril::entitymanager::v1::GetEntityRequest;\n\n#[tokio::main]\n\nasyncfnmain()->Result<(),Box<dynstd::error::Error>>{\n\nlet token =\"$YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN\";\n\nlet bearer_token =format!(\"Bearer {}\", token);\n\nlet header_value:MetadataValue<_>= bearer_token.parse().map_err(|_|Status::internal(\"Invalid Bearer Token\"))?;\n\nlet tls_config =ClientTlsConfig::new().with_native_roots();\n\nlet http_endpoint =format!(\"$YOUR_LATTICE_URL\");\n\nlet registration_channel =Channel::from_shared(http_endpoint)\n\n.map_err(|e|Status::invalid_argument(format!(\"Invalid HTTP endpoint: {}\", e)))?\n\n.tls_config(tls_config)\n\n.map_err(|_|Status::internal(\"TLS configuration failed\"))?\n\n.connect()\n\n.await\n\n.map_err(|e|Status::unavailable(format!(\"Failed to connect: {}\", e)))?;\n\nletmut em_client =EntityManagerApiClient::with_interceptor(registration_channel,|mut req:Request<()>|{\n\nreq.metadata_mut().insert(\"authorization\", header_value.clone());\n\nOk(req)\n\n});\n\nlet response = em_client.get_entity(GetEntityRequest{\n\nentity_id:String::from(\"$ENTITY_ID\")\n\n}).await?.into_inner();\n\nprintln!(\"Response: {:?}\", response);\n\nOk(())\n\n}\n\ninfo\n\nIn main.rs, replace $YOUR_LATTICE_URL, $YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN, and $ENTITY_ID with your information.\n\nYour project structure should now look similar to the following:\n\nTo install the gRPC SDK in Rust, do the following:\n\nAdd the lattice-sdk-rust dependency to your Cargo.toml file. You will also need a gRPC implementation. We recommend that you use Tonic and Tokio:\n\ncargoadd anduril-lattice-sdk\n\ncargoadd tonic -F features-tls\n\ncargoadd tokio -F full\n\nAfter installing the packages, Cargo adds Cargo.lock to your project folder. This file is automatically generated and updated by Cargo when you build or update your project. Cargo.lock ensures reproducible builds of your project by locking dependency versions. This helps you ensure consistency across different developments.\n\nYour Cargo.toml file should now look similar to the following:\n\n[package]\n\nname = \"$YOUR_PROJECT\"\n\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\n\nedition = \"2021\"\n\n[dependencies]\n\nanduril-lattice-sdk = \"1.0.0\"\n\ntonic = { version=\"0.8\", features=[\"tls\",\"tls-roots\"] }\n\ntokio = { version=\"1.0\", features=[\"full\"] }\n\nVerify that you can fetch the required dependencies:\n\ncargo build\n\nThis command compiles your Rust project and its dependencies. Cargo places the resulting binary files in target/debug.\n\nRun your project and connect to Lattice:\n\nIf the request is successful and you replaced the entity ID then you should see the entity object you created when setting up your development environment. If you did not change the entity ID to a valid, existing entity, then you will get the following error:\n\nThis means you successfully authenticated and completed the call to your environment, but the entity does not exist. This is an expected error. If you get any other error then there is a problem with your code. Check that your Lattice environment URL and our bearer token are correct.\n\nTo build an optimized binary release of your project, you can build your project using the --release option:\n\nThis creates an optimized build in target/release.\n\nIn main.rs, you first set up the Tokio runtime and the main function. This is the entry point for your program. You then declare and parse the bearer token you previously generated.\n\nNext, you create a secure TLS channel using your Lattice environment hostname.\n\nThen, you create a new API client, EntityManagerApiClient with an interceptor. The interceptor modifies each outgoing API request and passes your token to request's authorization metadata header.\n\nFinally, using the get_entity method, you pass in your $ENTITY_ID and make an asynchronous API call to the Lattice API.",
      "# [Lattice SDK quickstart: Publish vessel](https://docs.anduril.com/guide/quickstart)\nExperiment with the Lattice SDK before you develop your application by connecting to the Lattice environment and publishing a surface vessel.\n\nConnect with your Anduril representatives to get access to a Lattice environment. If you have access, go to $YOUR_LATTICE_URL/docs for documentation that includes features to streamline your development process.\n\nMake sure you have the curl command-line tool by running the following in your terminal:\n\ncurl--version\n\nIf you get a message similar to command not found: curl, download and install curl.\n\nSecurely save the bearer token to authenticate requests to the Lattice environment:\n\nGo to the Account & Security page in Lattice: $YOUR_LATTICE_URL/user-settings\n\nIn the Bearer tokens section, click + New Token and enter the following:\n\nFor Bearer token name, enter a descriptive name for your bearer token.\n\nFor Bearer token expiration, select an expiration time frame.\n\nClick Create to generate and copy your bearer token. After this step, the bearer token will not be visible again.\n\nIn your terminal, enter the following command:\n\nIf the request is successful, you get a 200 status response with an empty body: {}.\n\nWhen refreshing this page, the code sample above dynamically updates values in the following fields to create unique objects in your environment:\n\nentity_id\n\ncreatedTime\n\nexpiryTime\n\naliases.name\n\nprovenance.sourceUpdateTime\n\nThe previous request publishes a track entity to your Lattice environment. You can verify the surface vessel in your Lattice environment:\n\nGo to your Lattice environment.\n\nOpen the Track panel by clicking Tracks in your environment's left-hand sidebar.\n\nIn the Track panel's search bar, find your published surface vessel by searching for the aliases.name value that you specified in your request.\n\nTo center your view on the surface vessel, select the vessel in the Tracks panel and click Center.\n\nYou have successfully made a request using the Lattice SDK and published a surface vessel entity to Lattice.",

When asked to elaborate about which countries could be brought in, the Secretary said only that \"the tendency will be to [invite] our closest partners, our strategic partners\" and that this would be a \"natural\" decision for a program of this type.\n\n#### Comment ID l15dg0r with +14 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-04-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aerospace/comments/1ccau4y/anduril_a_california_company_founded_by_fired/l15dg0r/) (in reply to ID l15bnbs):\nI have much more faith in general atomics to deliver here, and I think the use of a gambit derived platform *could* allow for multiple variants under a single production run, similar to the JSF.\n\n### Comment ID l15okia with +5 score by [(LilDewey99, Reddit, 2024-04-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aerospace/comments/1ccau4y/anduril_a_california_company_founded_by_fired/l15okia/) (in reply to ID l14c209):\nbut muh narrative\n\n### Comment ID l177cm7 with +3 score by [(No_Image_4986, Reddit, 2024-04-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aerospace/comments/1ccau4y/anduril_a_california_company_founded_by_fired/l177cm7/) (in reply to ID l14c209):\nWhere do you see it was a FFP contract\n\n### Comment ID l14le0q with +27 score by [(hootblah1419, Reddit, 2024-04-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aerospace/comments/1ccau4y/anduril_a_california_company_founded_by_fired/l14le0q/) (in reply to ID l14c209):\nI don't think you're giving enough credit to Anduril.

In newer anduril versions they can be enabled as main channels but they only have the two brightness levels you can see when they are in aux mode. The HD10 is essentially a white light only deal.

It is only nice for toys. Yes, it offers a lot of flexibility in some ways, but then it is absolutely rigid and not configurable at all in others. It also offers no way to lock configuration, so you always have a chance to screw something up by misclicking or something in the most inconvenient moment when you need the light to work. Or it might screw itself up if signal tube is not making good contact or something, requiring a reset and reconfiguration.",

Besides my general hesitancy around working for the military industrial complex, if you want to go in that direction, Lockheed Martin is certainly friendlier to employee diversity than Palmer Luckey has very, very vocally been. Are Luckey's views on trans people, queer people, muslims, et cetera consistent with what the workplace is like?\n\n\nBeyond that, are ACM and IEEE ethics guidelines considered within the software and hardware teams? Autonomous weapons are an understandably controversial point of R&D, especially when, from my understanding, Anduril is willing to sell directly to Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and several other violators of international law and human rights, provided they are American allies. \n\nIn that vein, is there any freedom for employees to refuse to work directly on weapons teams? I don't mean to come across as combative, but Anduril and Luckey are very visible in the startup space for plenty of interesting and plenty of concerning reasons, which I think should be addressed to the same degree as the technical aspects of these roles. \n\nNonetheless, I don't really expect I'm going to see a response to any of this. So my only advice to other software engineers excited about more functional roles is to make sure you read into Palmer and Anduril closely ahead of applying, especially if you're coming from a community that might be particularly unwelcome according to Palmer.\n\n\nedit: the discomfort with my criticisms is disappointing, but not totally unexpected. at least Rust, Julia, and APL remain very accepting communities! and Haskell's leadership is great, too.\n\n### Comment ID lyp573a with +2 score by [(xedrac, Reddit, 2024-11-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1gkek8a/anduril_industries_is_hiring_summer_2025_haskell/lyp573a/) (in reply to ID lvsf0v9):\nI don't work for Anduril directly, but I've been to their HQ a few times and have done some contract work for them.  I've seen a few of their posts on here, and they often get a lot of hate, and I don't understand it.  So as someone that isn't beholden to them, let me give my perspective.  They have one of the best cultures I've seen in any company I've done work for.  I attribute that partially to Palmer and his unorthodox take on running a business and his larger-than-life attitude.  On campus you'll see one of the most diverse set of employees anywhere.  The level of competence is also very high.  I would have loved to have an internship opportunity like this when I was a budding engineer.  Sure you could go intern at Lockheed, and do your little pigeon-holed task where you are nothing more than an E1 resource label on some bean counter's spreadsheet, working on some crusty old project that has so many rules surrounding it you can't really do anything.  Or you could work on some incredibly interesting projects with a lot of really smart people around you, who all are very productive and willing to teach you what they know.  Your opportunity for growth is excellent.  There are a couple downsides though.  You might get fat because they feed you really good food every day for breakfast and lunch, and they have snacks everywhere you look.  Some of the people work very strange hours.  The flexibility is obviously very nice, but sometimes it can make it hard to coordinate with others in a timely manner.  Lastly, Anduril might raise your expectations unnecessarily high for what jobs are supposed to be like.  It will likely spoil you for all of your future jobs.  I don't say that jokingly.  Anduril really is quite special in this regard.\n\n### Comment ID lvya83p with +5 score by [(palmerluckey, Reddit, 2024-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1gkek8a/anduril_industries_is_hiring_summer_2025_haskell/lvya83p/) (in reply to ID lvsf0v9):\n*\"Lockheed Martin is certainly friendlier to employee diversity than Palmer Luckey has very, very vocally been.\"*\n\nSounds like you are just making things up.\n\n*\"is there any freedom for employees to refuse to work directly on weapons teams?\"*\n\nAnduril is a weapons company.\n\n*\"especially if you're coming from a community that might be particularly unwelcome according to Palmer\"*\n\nYou are so full of shit.\n\n#### Comment ID lvyklmn with +1 score by [(Instrume, Reddit, 2024-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1gkek8a/anduril_industries_is_hiring_summer_2025_haskell/lvyklmn/) (in reply to ID lvya83p):\n>*\"especially if you're coming from a community that might be particularly unwelcome according to Palmer\"*\n\n>You are so full of shit.\n\nSo, you're confirming that Anduril employs LGBTQIA people provided that they fit into the company culture and legally can be employed on your clearance projects?

The clearance check is paid for by the company, so, let's say, they file for your clearance investigation despite known red flags, and you're not approved. That means, not only did they tie up a slot for you, delaying hiring of retainable employees, they also paid more than 20,000 USD to do the clearance investigation and got nothing for it.\n\n\n\nIn any programming community, you'll have divergence of political views given the diverse backgrounds of its users.

Anduril and Luckey's particular rejection of such employees (if they are in fact in agreement) is worth me at least mentioning- I certainly wasn't disallowing people from applying to the position (honestly, I might apply anyways- I believe my security clearance is still valid). \n\nI stand by the questions being fair to ask and criticism of Anduril (even under one of their own job postings) being allowable. I also am not sure that a given defense company rejecting marginalized communities under the impression they have innately unamerican sympathies would go over well in court, though I have no reason to think Anduril is as serious a discriminator as that- I'm just referring to your point about like-minded employees. \n\nReally my concern with Anduril is mostly with Palmer, which is why I keep comparing Lockheed Martin to them. I also think Anduril goes a little bit under the radar in terms of his antics than, for instance, Musk and SpaceX, while dealing with a more serious and important to regulate industry. So I think letting people know to look into it is more than fair. Who knows, maybe I'm making the recruiters job easier too if it means they're getting less applications from either anti imperialists, gays, or russian spies.

I think Thiel rightly infers that Sauron is very modern compared to the archaic Free Peoples (thus his preference for the industrial Mordor as opposed to the agrarian Shire). \n\nIt tracks with Tolkien being incredibly reactionary toward modernity. He watched the countryside of his youth and his idealistic youth itself be ravaged by the Modern Industrial Death Machine in the Great War. It’s no surprise Tolkien made Sauron, his big baddie, very modern. Him and Saruman are basically in the process of making a modern industrial nation state. Whereas the Free Peoples are more interested in preserving and even restoring the Old Ways and Traditions as well as conserving the natural world. \n\nIt’s no surprise that Sauron’s project is more enticing to people like Thiel. Sauron’s view of the natural world, as a resource to be exploited rather than a precious sacred thing with a value in and of itself, apart from merely its usefulness as a commodity, is right in line with modern neo liberal capitalist thinking. Sauron seeks to overcome Nature, to “break it”, reduce it to atoms and molecules in service of power, material affluence and domination. It is a very scientific reductionist way of thinking. Sauron and Saruman dabble in the scientific method and genetics, breeding the Uruk Khai. Sauron is also very modern in his rejection of God or the god(s). He seeks to invent his own meaning, value and purpose apart from God. He is entirely this-worldly, concerned with worldly power, not concerned at all with the otherworldliness of the religious traditions that Nietzsche also condemned.\n\n### Comment ID lh2sdw0 with +39 score by [(Ander_the_Reckoning, Reddit, 2024-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrmemes/comments/1emubjj/anduril_and_palantir_yall_idiots_definitely/lh2sdw0/) (in reply to ID lh2gvt1):\nPeter Thiel can suck a fat cock and choke on it\n\n- Pippin\n\n### Comment ID lh6dzmt with +7 score by [(bookwyrm713, Reddit, 2024-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrmemes/comments/1emubjj/anduril_and_palantir_yall_idiots_definitely/lh6dzmt/) (in reply to ID lh2gvt1):\nSeems to have taken inspiration from Saruman.\n\n“The real war does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its conclusion.

Saruman, failing to get possession of the Ring, would in the confusion and treacheries of the time have found in Mordor the missing links in his own researches into Ring-lore, and before long he would have made a Great Ring of his own with which to challenge the self-styled Ruler of Middle-earth. In that conflict both sides would have held hobbits in hatred and contempt: they would not long have survived even as slaves.”\n\n### Comment ID lh2sa5h with +10 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrmemes/comments/1emubjj/anduril_and_palantir_yall_idiots_definitely/lh2sa5h/) (in reply to ID lh2gvt1):\nBet he's just a fan of ugly guys in black leather\n\n### Comment ID lh3wl9b with +4 score by [(Fluffy_History, Reddit, 2024-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrmemes/comments/1emubjj/anduril_and_palantir_yall_idiots_definitely/lh3wl9b/) (in reply to ID lh2gvt1):\nThats a very insane stance to take.\n\n### Comment ID lh40g0v with +4 score by [(hemareddit, Reddit, 2024-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrmemes/comments/1emubjj/anduril_and_palantir_yall_idiots_definitely/lh40g0v/) (in reply to ID lh2gvt1):\nHe’s not the first person to be seduced by the beauty of GROND.\n\n### Comment ID lh4m7nn with +2 score by [(Lancearon, Reddit, 2024-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrmemes/comments/1emubjj/anduril_and_palantir_yall_idiots_definitely/lh4m7nn/) (in reply to ID lh2gvt1):\nPalantir is a good descriptor for the company too... sees everything... can collect data...\n\n### Comment ID lh4vrsm with +2 score by [(IAmANobodyAMA, Reddit, 2024-08-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrmemes/comments/1emubjj/anduril_and_palantir_yall_idiots_definitely/lh4vrsm/) (in reply to ID lh2gvt1):\nSounds like he is a fan of *The Last Ringbearer*\n\n### Comment ID lh9rbvb with +2 score by [(Cy41995, Reddit, 2024-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrmemes/comments/1emubjj/anduril_and_palantir_yall_idiots_definitely/lh9rbvb/) (in reply to ID lh2gvt1):\nWow.

Apparently Durendal was the name of the mythical sword of one of the emperor Charlemagne's paladins named Roland.  It was said to be the sharpest sword in existence and was used to hold off a 100,000 strong Muslim army.  It struck me as strange that if you rearranged the syllables in Durendal you could get Endural which is somewhat close to Anduril.

The appearance of Boromir's horn in the movies being similar to a real life horn may be coincidence, but it's also just as likely to be an inspiration.\n\nAs for Andúril and Durandal being similarly named, it's very likely that Tolkien drew upon any number of mythical blades when creating the story behind any of the blades in his stories, but the names are almost entirely constructed using his languages. That is why LotR exists at all, as a vehicle for his languages.\n\nThe only explicit reference is Avallónë, a sea port on the shores of Tol Eressëa.\n\n### Comment ID d74s6jn with +3 score by [(PurelySC, Reddit, 2016-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/50k46o/anduril/d74s6jn/) (in reply to ID d74poa2):\n>That is why LotR exists at all, as a vehicle for his languages.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but isn't that why *The Silmarillion* exists?

In the industry, SpaceX is known but doesn't really have a good reputation. Anduril is a newer company but they just won a billion dollar contract for SOCOM so trust me they are known. Employers evaluate your technical skills and achievements regardless of where they come from. Seeing SpaceX on your resume just means you've endured a toxic work environment. We live in a capitaistic society so your labor should go to the highest bidder. SpaceX isn't some sort of noble pursuit. They are looking to overwork and underpay you, and they are hoping the myth perpetuated by Elon and his fandom will drive you to sacrifice your personal life so they can get some cheap labor. You have to remember that working overtime as a salaried employee means you are actually making less money because the amount they pay you doesn't change so avoid it as much as possible. You will grow and learn at Anduril and you will be well compensated for it. Easy decision imo.\n\n### Comment ID ixheexs with +13 score by [(kalenxy, Reddit, 2022-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/z2ibl0/internship_spacex_starlink_anduril_or_northrop/ixheexs/) (in reply to ID ixgnde8):\nI'm not disagreeing with you in any way, you are spot on.

At the same time, I have seen companies that I know are great places to work give their interns practically nothing to do during their internship.\n\n#### Comment ID ixhpxig with +24 score by [(Navynuke00, Reddit, 2022-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/z2ibl0/internship_spacex_starlink_anduril_or_northrop/ixhpxig/) (in reply to ID ixheexs):\n>While SpaceX might not be a desirable place to work full time, it's possible that they have a good intern experience.\n\n(Morgan Freeman voice)\n\nThey don't.\n\n### Comment ID ixhgdss with +1 score by [(NotAHost, Reddit, 2022-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/z2ibl0/internship_spacex_starlink_anduril_or_northrop/ixhgdss/) (in reply to ID ixgnde8):\nFor some reason I thought I read there was some issues with the Anduril contract.\n\n## Comment ID ixhk9kp with +27 score by [(bobj33, Reddit, 2022-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/z2ibl0/internship_spacex_starlink_anduril_or_northrop/ixhk9kp/) (in reply to ID z2ibl0):\nEveryone says that SpaceX and Tesla are sweatshops and after the last month there is no way I'd ever work for Elon.\n\nThe pay at Anduril is far and away the highest.

They had decent pay for your position, but it’s also easy to get bored at places like NG. It’s also easy to have a steady work life balance. \n\nSpacex would be the opposite. I had a Comintern at NG from SpaceX and he joked that they always users women recruiters to try to appeal more to candidates. I suspect just coincidence but I noticed it when SpaceX came to me a year ago. That being said, it seems cool but also seems miserable, they have the industry nickname of “SlaveX” for a reason. A different engineer I met at a different internship at a research lab did not return to spacex. \n\nIt’s one summer. I’d skip NG because they’ll take you on afterwards regardless if you did the internship. I’m biased slightly against Anduril/startups long term, but this is a summer where you should take relatively low risk of an internship to prepare yourself to see how good or bad things are when you go full time. SpaceX or Anduril are both great experiences, but yeah spacex will pay less and will have harder work. Both have their risks, and that’s exactly why I’d do either of them as an internship to see if I did want to work there after. I’d do Anduril just because there’s less info on day to day life and because I’d probably rather work there than spacex. That being said, dipping into RFIC can be lucrative (well, at other companies besides spacex), but I’ve heard tape outs are miserable. \n\nI personally wonder if there’s going to be a negative outlook of Musk companies down the road in the industry, but no reason to believe that.\n\n## Comment ID ixgnsw5 with +3 score by [(Chemaid, Reddit, 2022-11-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/z2ibl0/internship_spacex_starlink_anduril_or_northrop/ixgnsw5/) (in reply to ID z2ibl0):\nHonestly I’d think you get more RF exposure in the RF silicon team at spacex. Anduril is likely using off the shelf components and you’d be integrating components to meet a product spec.

Usually it's wire or metal sheet wrapped around the lower half, though there are examples the have elongated pommels or even bare tangs.   \n\nThe practical reason is that the lower half of the grip is the wear point on a two handed sword, and leather, cloth, or wood ends up looking ratty on a sword that's being used seriously. Your support hand moves on the grip much more than the dominant hand, and if you're wearing gloves or gauntlets will quickly wear through a leather grip.\n\n## Comment ID j60v94y with +3 score by [(M4DM1ND, Reddit, 2023-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWORDS/comments/10lr7fn/why_does_anduril_from_lord_of_the_rings_have_this/j60v94y/) (in reply to ID 10lr7fn):\nWell Elendil was a Numenorian and they were basically super humans.

People say it is too complicated but rather I think it is like being able to make your torch function the way you want to without thinking \"I wish my light can do this\", because with Anduril, you have less opportunity cost options to deal with.\n\nI think really the main point of Anduril is its \"set and forget\" feature. It has a lot of options, but it doesn't mean you need to click it a lot of times every time. Once you set it up the way you like, it is good to go and you don't have to switch to set modes too.\n\nAlso, you can download the eeprom as well, meaning you can save your options settings and potentially transfer it to other Anduril lights with the same features and firmware build.\n\n## Comment ID kb3j1xn with +2 score by [(Geromegoons, Reddit, 2023-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kb3j1xn/) (in reply to ID 185cxre):\nRidiculous.\n\nI enjoy tinkering and nerding out over things like torches but when I see this my honest reaction is \"I'm not reading that\".\n\nIs there not a way we just plug the torch in to a USB port on a PC and config it with a small program?

The instructions for the flashlight. Sitting in the woods somewhere. Haha. Now I'm really glad Simon Convoy is still using his flashlight firmware, where you can just pick the mode that suits you from a few presets. \n\nI love the flexibility of customization and geek stuff.

It's basically just \"click for on/off, hold to change brightness\", and then there are a bunch of optional things available for people who want them.  [The manual](https://github.com/ToyKeeper/anduril/blob/trunk/docs/anduril-manual.md) has the details in a form which is hopefully not so intimidating.  Most of the features are disabled by default, and only accessible after switching to advanced mode... so by default, it just acts like a pretty normal flashlight.\n\n## Comment ID kcoh1cw with +1 score by [(Practical_Self3090, Reddit, 2023-12-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/185cxre/heres_the_new_updated_anduril_2_flowchart_for/kcoh1cw/) (in reply to ID 185cxre):\nThis gave me flashbacks to studying [metabolic pathways](https://curtiswrightmaps.com/wp-content/uploads/map_03-30-20_300dpi_12.42x19.09_inv830.1-scaled.jpg) diagrams in biology class XD"

Managers are skilled at engineering tasks, but are clueless when it comes to managing people. I've seen too many onboarding engineers left without proper support and insight into how to do their jobs well and it's actually pathetic. How do you expect new engineers to meet tight deadlines if they're not given the proper tools and support to do so? This company has the potential to be something great, but not the way it's being ran currently. However, even outside of management, most what's being built out is glorified demoware that the government is buying into because their software hasn't been updated since the 1990's and anything new is considered to be a massive upgrade.

The few lead tech positions available have been filled by relatively inexperienced employees with with less than a year of experience, so very poor managerial choices in regard to who gets promoted. On that note, tech leadership positions are just appointments, they don't hold interviews for anyone else who may be qualified or interested. Management doesn't really seem to have much interest in developing their employees professionally. Annual review structure is disorganized at best and raises are very small (less than 2% raise each year even with a stellar review). Have to work 3-4 hours of overtime every day to even make a decent living to survive. All funding is essentially saved for the army of software engineers they hire and fire every quarter. On a weekly basis I have one or another newly graduated engineer attempt to tell me how to do my job (with over a decade of tech experience). The last several years have been nothing short of an extremely frustrating experience and huge letdown from what was promised when I quit my previous job and came here. Had I known what I do now, I would've never wasted my time applying.",

It seems impossible to attend a meeting or engage in a conversation without Palantir being brought up. While it's reasonable to appreciate and model after a successful business, it becomes excessive when it feels like every new hire or internal initiative mirrors Palantir. I applied for a position at Anduril with the intention of contributing to and aligning with the unique culture of Anduril.\n\nWhile there are individuals who genuinely embody the values of Anduril, a significant portion seems to adopt Palantir's entire leadership, strategic, and cultural philosophy. While Palantir has undoubtedly achieved noteworthy accomplishments, it's important to note that Palantir is not synonymous with Palmer Luckey. If individuals are joining the company solely because of Palmer, they might discover a scenario resembling Palantir 2.0, as opposed to the original vision they may have anticipated.",

On that note, tech leadership positions are just appointments, they don't hold interviews for anyone else who may be qualified or interested. Management doesn't really seem to have much interest in developing their employees professionally. Annual review structure is disorganized at best and raises are very small (less than 2% raise each year even with a stellar review). Have to work 3-4 hours of overtime every day to even make a decent living to survive. All funding is essentially saved for the army of software engineers they hire and fire every quarter. On a weekly basis I have one or another newly graduated engineer attempt to tell me how to do my job (with over a decade of tech experience).

Managers are skilled at engineering tasks, but are clueless when it comes to managing people. I've seen too many onboarding engineers left without proper support and insight into how to do their jobs well and it's actually pathetic. How do you expect new engineers to meet tight deadlines if they're not given the proper tools and support to do so? This company has the potential to be something great, but not the way it's being ran currently. However, even outside of management, most what's being built out is glorified demoware that the government is buying into because their software hasn't been updated since the 1990's and anything new is considered to be a massive upgrade.

      "# [Ohio Partners with Anduril to “Rebuild the Arsenal” for Essential National Security Needs](https://governor.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/governor/media/news-and-media/ohio-partners-with-anduril-to-rebuild-the-arsenal-for-essential-national-security-needs)\n(PICKAWAY COUNTY, Ohio)— Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, Lt. Governor Jon Husted, and JobsOhio announced today that Anduril Industries, a leader in defense technology, will establish an advanced manufacturing facility in Pickaway County, bringing more than 4,000 new production and service jobs to Ohio by 2035.\n\nThe five-million-square-foot facility, named Arsenal-1, represents the largest single job creation and new payroll project in Ohio’s history and is projected to add nearly $1 billion to Ohio’s gross domestic product.\n\nBased in Costa Mesa, Calif., Anduril aims to “Rebuild the Arsenal” of U.S. military weapons and platforms by “hyperscaling” manufacturing with advanced software and production technologies. The Ohio facility will strengthen the state’s position as a nationwide leader in the development of better, faster, and more affordable critical national defense products to help the United States deter, defend, and lead in the world’s Great Power Competition.\n\n“Ohio’s history of advancing aviation, aerospace, and national defense runs deep, but what sets this state apart is our readiness to embrace the future,” said Governor DeWine. “At this critical moment in time, our country needs rapid technological innovation, which Anduril will deliver using Ohio’s skilled, hardworking labor force. The future of American air power will be made in Ohio!”\n\nGov. DeWine & Lt. Gov. Husted will join Anduril to provide more information on this historic announcement today at 9 a.m. Watch live at OhioChannel.org.\n\nThe facility will be located on 500 acres in Pickaway County near Rickenbacker International Airport, with room for future growth. The company plans to invest over $900 million in capital into the surrounding area.\n\nAnduril was attracted to Ohio due to the state’s supportive business climate, ready-made workforce, and legacy of military and federal support.\n\n\"Today is a proud day for Ohio as we welcome Anduril and celebrate the creation of thousands of new jobs in cutting-edge defense manufacturing,” said Lt. Governor Jon Husted. “This investment reinforces Ohio's position as a leader in advanced technology and national security. When it comes to 'Made in America,' you can’t do it without 'Made in Ohio.”\n\nIn addition to the 4,000 direct jobs at Arsenal-1, the project is anticipated to create a total of 4,500 indirect and induced jobs over the next ten years and more than $2 billion in annual economic output. Over $1 billion in in-state labor income will be generated, and projected tax revenues are estimated to be roughly $800 million.\n\n“Arsenal-1 represents a significant step forward in how we build the autonomous systems and weapons our nation and allies need, leveraging Ohio’s world-class workforce, robust infrastructure, and scalable, software-driven manufacturing to set a new standard for securing the future of defense,” said Anduril Industries CEO Brian Schimpf. “We are ready to break ground and get to work building the capabilities that will strengthen America’s industrial base and national security for years to come.”\n\nThe project will pursue a Job Creation Tax Credit from the Ohio Department of Development at an upcoming Tax Credit Authority meeting. The project will also request $70 million from the All Ohio Future Fund at an upcoming Controlling Board meeting. The All Ohio Future Fund was established by the DeWine-Husted Administration in partnership with the Ohio General Assembly to support local communities with site-readiness and preparation to attract economic development projects.\n\nSeparately, JobsOhio plans to provide assistance to the project with a JobsOhio Grant and will disclose the amount of funding after the agreements have been signed. JobsOhio will also provide Anduril with Talent Acquisition Services to work with the company to attract, develop, and retain the skilled workforce the company requires.\n\nThe build out of the facility is expected to begin immediately after state and local approvals, and the first products are targeted to be manufactured beginning in July 2026.\n\nTo meet their bold staffing needs, Anduril will tap into Ohio's third-largest manufacturing workforce, a statewide network of hundreds of universities, community colleges, and technical centers, and leverage JobsOhio's Talent Acquisition Services.\n\nAnduril: Rebuilding the Arsenal in Ohio\n\nAnduril recently announced $1.5 billion in funding to hyperscale defense manufacturing. Arsenal-1 in Ohio will be the first manufacturing facility equipped to produce tens of thousands of autonomous weapons systems addressing the urgent needs of the United States and its allies. Anduril is redefining what scale means, which is necessary to support building capacity for future defense needs.\n\nUnlike traditional defense contractors that focus primarily on hardware, Anduril’s core system is Lattice OS, an AI-powered autonomous sensemaking and command-and-control platform. Lattice brings autonomy to defense's most challenging missions with open, modular, and scalable hardware components for a layered family-of-systems approach that helps deliver higher-quality products faster and more affordably.\n\nDesigned by Anduril. Built in Ohio.\n\nThe partnership established by Anduril and Team Ohio that led to today’s announcement reflects Ohio’s enduring legacy and ongoing commitment to the United States military and its evolving goal of safeguarding our nation. The project is also supported by One Columbus, Pickaway County officials, and many other local, state, and federal leaders.\n\nAlong with aerospace and defense work by GE Aerospace, Honeywell, Sierra Nevada Corp., Joby Aviation, L3 Harris, General Dynamics, and others, Anduril’s decision to make a home here shows how that heritage converges with a skilled, diverse workforce and unparalleled strength in advanced manufacturing and technology to make Ohio the go-to place for forward-looking innovators in the defense sector.\n\n“You can’t outsource national security, and today, Ohio is sending a message to the world: Companies that deliver the most complex, challenging, and sophisticated solutions for the defense of the United States of America will find no better home than right here in the ‘Heart of it All,’” said JobsOhio President and CEO J.P. Nauseef. “The intersection of advanced manufacturing, military and defense, technology, innovation, and the nation’s hardest-working and highly skilled workers creates the ideal environment for these companies to achieve their goals of making our country safer and stronger. Best of all, Anduril will be just down the road to the military customer at Wright Patterson Air Force Base - where the Wright Brothers learned to fly more than 100 years ago! As the United States reshores this capability and fundamentally changes the way we develop solutions to safeguard our nation, Ohio is the place that gets it done better, faster, and more affordably than anywhere else.”\n\nAnduril’s new Pickaway County facility will not only push the boundaries of manufacturing technology, it will also catalyze a new frontier of economic development in Ohio. Company officials chose the site in Pickaway County for several reasons, including its adjacent location to Rickenbacker International Airport, which gives the company direct runway access for product testing and development. Rickenbacker is a civil-military public airport that supports the world’s largest aircraft. It also offers a wide range of scalable services for all aircraft types, including corporate, general aviation, commercial, air freight, and military.\n\n“This project will diversify our economy, strengthen our nation, create thousands of terrific jobs, and immediately establish the Columbus Region as a center of defense technology and manufacturing,” said Kenny McDonald, President and CEO of One Columbus. “The bold leadership of the DeWine-Husted Administration, JobsOhio, and Pickaway County were pivotal in making this project a reality.”\n\nPickaway County Commissioner Jay Wippel added: “Pickaway County has spent nearly two decades preparing for this opportunity, laying the groundwork to attract transformative projects like Arsenal-1. Through deliberate planning, investment in infrastructure, and a shared commitment among local leaders, businesses, and partners like One Columbus and JobsOhio, we’ve created an environment where innovation and advanced manufacturing can thrive. This project reflects the strength of those efforts and marks a new chapter of growth and opportunity for our community.”\n\nAnduril & Ohio: Where Heroes Get Their Hardware\n\nThis project represents the clearest and strongest example yet of Ohio’s role in developing and delivering vital national defense strategies and the solutions to execute those strategies. As the birthplace of aviation and the home of the Wright Brothers, pioneering American space icons like Neil Armstrong and John Glenn, Ohio has been and remains a visionary force within the aerospace industry, driving innovation and growth in every facet.\n\nSome of the reasons that make Ohio uniquely qualified to partner with Anduril include:\n\nOhio’s vast, supportive military ecosystem, which includes:\n\nHome to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base; the Air Force Research Laboratory; Defense Supply Center Columbus; Ohio National Guard’s 179th Cyberspace Wing; NASA’s Glenn Research Center and Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility; Central Ohio Aerospace & Technology Center; and the National Space Intelligence Center of the U.S. Space Force\n\nOhio’s Aerospace & Aviation sector is a recognized engine of growth and success for both military and commercial endeavors\n\nOhio stands apart as a leader in autonomous vehicles and the burgeoning advanced air mobility\n\nOhio is the top supplier state to Boeing and Airbus\n\nOhio is the new headquarters for GE Aerospace\n\nOhio has the 7th largest aerospace and defense employment in the U.S.\n\n\"Ohio’s success is built on our investment in people, innovation, and opportunity,” said Lydia Mihalik, director of the Ohio Department of Development. “Companies like Anduril are choosing Ohio because we’ve created an environment where businesses thrive and Ohioans prosper.”\n\nMORE: State, Federal, & Local Business Leaders React to the Announcement\n\nOhio’s Workforce Stands Ready\n\nOhio combines a skilled manufacturing and technology workforce with one of the country’s largest military and veteran populations to provide a pipeline of talent that is uniquely qualified to support Anduril.\n\nMore than 200 higher-education institutions, including 70+ that offer programs leading to Aerospace Occupations\n\nFive R1 Carnegie Research Institutions\n\n6,200 tech graduates every year\n\nNearly $500 million in key workforce development investments, including career tech expansion, higher education workforce training equipment, industry sector partnerships, and upskilling programs\n\n$300 million investment in Ohio’s Innovation Districts to generate 47,500 STEM graduates over 10 years\n\nSince 2017, JobsOhio’s data-backed approach to attracting, developing, and retaining top talent has helped 85 Ohio companies hire 21,323 new employees\n\nFrom 2019 to 2023, a net 97,000 people came to Ohio for job-related reasons\n\nJobsOhio’s Find Your Ohio program helps connect veterans and transitioning military members with employment opportunities at companies like Anduril\n\nAbout JobsOhio\n\nJobsOhio, Ohio's private nonprofit economic development corporation, enhances company growth and personnel development through business attraction, retention, and expansion across ten competitive industry sectors.

      "# [Pentagon awards Anduril $14.3 million to expand production of solid rocket motors by Sandra Erwin on 2025-01-07](https://spacenews.com/pentagon-awards-anduril-14-3-million-to-expand-production-of-solid-rocket-motors/)\nWASHINGTON — Defense technology contractor Anduril Industries has secured a $14.3 million Pentagon contract to expand solid rocket motor production, as the U.S. Department of Defense moves to strengthen domestic manufacturing capabilities amid growing supply chain concerns.\n\nThe contract, awarded under the Defense Production Act, will support facility modernization and manufacturing improvements at Anduril’s Mississippi plant, the Pentagon said Jan. 7.\n\n“This agreement leverages Anduril’s substantial $75 million private capital investment and aligns with our strategy to build supply chain resiliency,” Laura Taylor-Kale, assistant secretary of defense for industrial base policy, said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia-based Anduril, which acquired solid rocket motor manufacturer Adranos in June 2023, is an emerging player in a sector traditionally dominated by a handful of contractors. The company’s proprietary ALITEC fuel technology, obtained through the Adranos acquisition, promises enhanced missile range capabilities.\n\nThe contract follows Anduril’s $19 million agreement with the U.S. Navy in June 2024 to develop rocket motors for the Standard Missile 6 program.\n\nThe Pentagon’s investment comes as the Ukraine conflict has exposed vulnerabilities in U.S. weapons production capacity. Military officials have warned about depleting stockpiles of missile systems that rely on solid rocket motors, including Javelin and Stinger missiles.\n\nIndustry consolidation has squeezed U.S. solid rocket motor manufacturing since the 1990s, with the number of producers dropping from six to two. The sector has also grappled with limited suppliers for essential components like cases and nozzles.\n\nNew market entrants including Anduril, Ursa Major and X-Bow are now seeking to address these bottlenecks.\n\nThe Defense Production Act, enacted during the Korean War, gives the president broad authority to direct domestic industry for national defense purposes.",

      "# [funds robot submarine testing to court US customers by Valerie Insinna on 2024-12-09](http://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/anduril-self-funds-robot-submarine-testing-to-court-us-customers/)\nCOSTA MESA, Calif. — Anduril is putting a new autonomous submarine known as Dive-XL through endurance runs off the coast of California, as it seeks to tap into what company executives tell Breaking Defense they see as a growing commitment from the Pentagon to use unmanned underwater vehicles.\n\nThe first test vehicle — a non-missionized version of the Ghost Shark robotic submarine in development for the Royal Australian Navy — recently wrapped up a voyage where it spent 100 hours underway, a precursor to an upcoming demonstration where the Dive-XL will complete a mission in excess of 1,000 nautical miles while fully submerged.\n\n“That’s in the coming months — weeks, if you will. And that’ll be the longest that we believe anyone’s really done,” Shane Arnott, Anduril’s senior vice president for programs and engineering, said during an interview at the company’s headquarters in Costa Mesa, Calif.\n\nSo far, the tests around the California coast has allowed Anduril to pick up valuable data that will allow it to optimize Dive XL to operate in diverse undersea environments, where undersea terrain and water salinity could have an impact on performance, Arnott said.\n\n“The coast here is kind of like the Grand Canyon of subsea,” he said. “It is wild off California. Some of the terrain, it’s like Star Wars.”\n\nDive-XL is conceived as a modular uncrewed undersea vehicle (UUV) that can be purchased by both government and commercial customers and outfitted with payloads to serve various missions, whether that’s inspecting offshore oil rigs for energy companies or helping potential military users hunt down enemy submarines. A few sections of the vehicle are standard no matter the customer, including a nose section packed with avionics and sensing equipment that allows for autonomous movement, a tail containing the drive propulsor and a mast on top with communications gear such as acoustic and radio frequency systems.\n\nThe middle portion of the vehicle, however, can be customized by the customer to house whatever payload they need, and can be configured either as a single extra-large container or up to three smaller ones.\n\nThe smallest version of the Dive-XL can be housed in a 40 foot shipping container, which allows for it to be transported on roads or via a C-17 cargo plane, Arnott said. From there, it can be made bigger by adding additional payload compartments that stretch the size of the vessel, which Arnott said can be bolted on in a matter of hours.\n\nAnduril self-funded the construction of the first Dive-XL, as well as the ongoing demonstrations, due to growing confidence in a US market for the drone, including with the US Navy as a potential customer, executives said.\n\n“We literally had to go to Australia to find an excited customer in 2022 who wanted to do this work,” said Anduril Chief Strategy Officer Chris Brose in an interview on the sidelines of Reagan National Defense Forum on Saturday. “At the time, the belief was that the United States was not that partner yet, but if we showed them a different way to do this, you know, they might be a partner in the near future.”\n\nAlthough the Navy has shown interest in underwater drones for years through programs like the canceled Snakehead large displacement UUV, industry has struggled to build affordable vehicles capable of autonomously performing missions while withstanding the harsh deep sea environment, leaving some of those efforts to wither on the vine, Brose said.\n\n“They haven’t generated a lot of systems that sailors can take out on and under the water and really begin to operate and start to understand capabilities and limitations, experiment with new ways of using them [and] beginning to build out how would we man units to operate these systems,” he said.\n\nOne opportunity to break into the US market could arrive through a provision in the newly-released National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2025, which requires the Navy to conduct a competitive demonstration of extra large and large UUVs. The bill is set to be taken up by the House this week.\n\n“I think that people are starting to realize that these technologies are available and I think that what we have been able to do with the Australian navy has begun to make believers,” Brose said, adding that the Navy will likely need a mix of capabilities to meet the threat.\n\n“We’re not trying to get the Navy or US government or anybody to pick us as the sole winner always and forever,” he said. “We would like to be part of the winner’s circle.”\n\nOne extra-large UUV already in the hands of the Navy is Boeing’s Orca, which was delivered to the service last year. Lessons learned from testing that prototype will inform the development and build of five additional Orca production vehicles, the service said in December 2023. The construction of the first unit, known as XLE-1, is complete, and it is expected to be delivered in early 2025, the service said this month.\n\n“Orca, and other platforms like her, are an important step forward as we drive towards our future hybrid fleet, which is going be composed of manned and unmanned platforms,” Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti said in a statement after touring Boeing’s Orca manufacturing facility in Long Beach, Calif., on Dec. 6.\n\nCost could be a deciding factor for whether the Dive XL finds a home with the Navy, as questions about price continue to dog unmanned programs. Arnott declined to give specifics on the price point for the Dive XL but said it would be available for a fraction of the price of other extra-large UUVs under development.\n\nRELATED: Top senators urge Navy to change course on large USV program\n\n“Other companies building XLs are taking a different approach than us that are perhaps a bit more exotic in the capabilities. … They’re fundamentally much, much more expensive. A lot of it came down to the philosophy,” he said. “The problem is about numbers. … If we’re going to be effective as the West against what China’s doing, we need this many, and it’s a lot.”\n\nOne advantage to the Dive XL’s design is that it is electric powered, which means that it does not need to surface to allow a diesel engine to “breathe” and get the air necessary to function, Arnott said. It’s also “free-flooded with all the electronics housed in protective containers — meaning water can freely flow inside the vessel, as opposed to having pressurized compartments — which helps drive down cost and complexity, he said.\n\nAnduril is establishing a 100,000 square foot manufacturing plant in Quonset Point, R.I., that would take on commercial and US government orders and produce up to “dozens” of Dive XLs annually, the company said in a news release.\n\nRELATED: Anduril’s Aussie drone sub ‘one year early and on budget,’ heads to production\n\nMeanwhile, work also continues at a separate facility in Australia on the Australian navy’s Ghost Shark vehicles. The second of three Ghost Sharks ordered as part of the research and development program is currently under production, Arnott said.",
