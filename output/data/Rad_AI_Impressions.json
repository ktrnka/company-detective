      "# [Save Time and Decrease Burnout with Radiology AI Software](https://www.radai.com/)\nRad AI Continuity is the most comprehensive follow-up management platform on the market, tracking more than 50 categories of incidental findings and significantly increasing patient follow-up rates. Weâre very excited about this collaboration as it will allow us to have improved visibility and provide a safety net over our entire patient population to ensure our patients feel informed and empowered.\n\nWith Continuity, we have a 100% radiology safety net. Every single radiology report that comes in with an incidental finding has been communicated to the appropriate stakeholders. We're tracking whether or not those follow-ups happen within the appropriate, recommended timeframe mitigating all our liability to ensure that we keep patients in our network.\n\nThe amazing thing about Rad AI Reporting is that you're able to achieve exponential efficiency gains, but with less perceived effort. It doesn't benefit you if you're going faster but you know you're going fast because you're more fatigued. The idea is to smooth things out in a way where you're almost in a flow state, and Rad AI Reporting does that.\n\nHaving greatly benefited from using Rad AI Impressions, we are thrilled to add Continuity to our current partnership with the team at Rad AI. The management of incidental findings in radiology reports is a key focus for our group as itâs incredibly beneficial for the patients we serve. After evaluating every vendor in this space, we found that Continuity provides the most automated and most comprehensive solution in follow-up management.\n\nIt gives you the ability to generate a complete report in the interpreting radiologist's own language, whether you use structured reporting or dictate freely, just by dictating the pertinent findings. This saves an enormous amount of wasted energy in having to create full sentences.\n\nRad AI Impressions is what we have all been waiting for! Providing much-needed efficiency gains in my daily workflow life is sometimes absolutely surreal! It is like I have my own trainee who perfectly excels at impressions.\n\nUsing Rad AI Impressions to auto-generate my impressions has been wonderful. Iâve gotten to use it on overnight shifts, and itâs a game changer. It really helps with breezing through case volume with less fatigue.\n\nWhile hard to measure in minutes or seconds or even dollars, one huge value is the \"coffee sip\" factor. Before Rad AI Impressions, I was talking all the time and my cup of coffee in the morning would inevitably get cold. With Rad AI impressions, I get just long enough of a break to take a sip of warm coffee. And each time I sip my warm coffee, I smile.\n\nRad AI exceeded radiologist expectations out of the gate. Seamless integration permitted our radiologists to immediately realize the efficiencies of the Rad AI Impressions platform. With Rad AI, our radiologists reported feeling less stressed with more time available to review studies or tend to other tasks. This is exactly the type of IT solution needed to help reduce radiologistsâ burnout and boost job satisfaction.\n\nHaving greatly benefited from using Rad AI Impressions, we are thrilled to add Continuity to our current partnership with the team at Rad AI. The management of incidental findings in radiology reports is a key focus for our group as itâs incredibly beneficial for the patients we serve. After evaluating every vendor in this space, we found that Continuity provides the most automated and most comprehensive solution in follow-up management.\n\nWe have seen how critical it is to close the loop on significant incidental findings and what a challenging problem it is to address using our currently available resources. By automating the majority of steps related to patient follow-ups, Rad AI removes those manual tasks from our clinical team and gives them back more time to focus on caring for their patients.\n\nWhen we recently discussed our expansions and renewals for AI solutions, we saw Rad AI as a must-have. If we were to rank our solutions, it's at the top. With a high volume of high acuity cases, Rad AI Impressions helps us manage our caseload. The performance continues to improve -- in 90 to 95% of the impressions that it generates, I don't have to edit anything, and the consensus guideline recommendations are working really well.\n\nWe are committed to the patients and healthcare entities we serve, and we believe that partnering with Rad AI will improve the efficiency of our radiologists and increase the value associated with our services. We look forward to using Rad AI Impressions' automated impression technology to make our radiologists more effective and to help decrease burnout.\n\nRad AI Impressions will assist our radiologists in providing the highest-quality reports, while greatly reducing the rework that is built into the process. Weâre excited to partner with Rad AI, as the feedback weâve received from other Strategic Radiology members nationally has been overwhelmingly positive, and weâre looking forward to the same experience at our practice.\n\nWeâve been incredibly pleased with the partnership that has developed with Rad AI. As a CIO, your aim is to make investments in technology that make a tangible difference throughout the practice. Once the Rad AI Impressions rollout began, the benefits spread 'word of mouth' style like a brushfire. The radiologists became the largest supporters of the product â touting the efficiency, quality and overall reduction in fatigue improvements amongst themselves. Expansion of the agreement was a no-brainer. I would strongly encourage any radiology practice CIO seeking an impactful AI investment to prioritize a relationship with Rad AI.\n\nEven though Rad AI has an incredible reputation in the radiology community, we were hesitant to try AI in our practice and wanted to prove it out for ourselves. After using Rad AI Impressions with a small initial set of users, we are so glad we did as we saw an immediate impact. We are now rapidly expanding to the rest of the radiologists in our practice.\n\nAfter thoroughly evaluating numerous radiology AI solutions via our collaborative we believe Rad AI Impressions will provide the most impactful value proposition for our member groups. Rad AI impressions' automated impression generator extracted from the radiologistâs dictated findings not only results in enhanced report quality and efficiency, but also helps alleviate fatigue by the end of a shift.\n\nI knew from the first time I used Rad AI Impressions it would be a complete game-changer by allowing us to turn around the highest-quality reports faster with fewer addenda. Of all the technology and solutions that weâve implemented for our practice, Rad AI Impressions has made the biggest impact on our efficiency and quality. I have personally reached out to colleagues of mine to prioritize a partnership with Rad AI.\n\nOur practice has been on the forefront of innovation in radiology, building on our heritage of leading the way with transformative technologies that ultimately prove to become the gold standard for radiology practices. We believe our partnership with Rad AI will enable us to maintain this type of technological leadership, and Rad AI Impressions will be a powerfully assistive tool for our radiologists.\n\nWe expanded our partnership with Rad AI to every radiologist not just because of the benefits our radiologists experienced, but also because the Rad AI team is incredible to work with. They truly listen and prioritize our feedback.\n\nOur initial group of radiologist users were very impressed by Rad AIâs ability to reduce fatigue and improve productivity using artificial intelligence, while improving the quality of patient care. We evaluate many AI vendors, and Rad AI proved to not only be a valuable solution our radiologists wanted to use, but theyâve also been a fantastic partner in helping us fully leverage the power of AI to do more for our patients.\n\nItâs important to Inland Imaging to remain at the forefront of implementing groundbreaking technology to best serve our patients and provide the optimal environment for our radiologists to do their best work. Our radiologists are impressed with the efficiency gains, quality gains, and reduction in fatigue. Rad AI is an ideal partner that is both innovative and customer-focused, and places a premium on developing long-term partnerships.\n\nRad AI has made a big difference in my daily productivity and endurance throughout my day. I am now less mentally fatigued towards the end of my day because I do not have the added mental strain of summarizing my findings in the impression. The program does it for me. I also find myself catching more voice recognition errors when I read over the generated impression which allows me to go back and fix these errors in the body of the reportâ¦ an added bonus!",

      "# [SIIM 2023](https://www.radai.com/events/conferences/siim-2023)\nWhen we recently discussed our expansions and renewals for AI solutions, we saw Rad AI as a must-have. If we were to rank our solutions, it's at the top. With a high volume of high acuity cases, Rad AI Impressions helps us manage our caseload. The performance continues to improve -- in 90 to 95% of the impressions that it generates, I don't have to edit anything, and the consensus guideline recommendations are working really well.\n\nEven though Rad AI has an incredible reputation in the radiology community, we were hesitant to try AI in our practice and wanted to prove it out for ourselves. After using Rad AI Impressions with a small initial set of users, we are so glad we did as we saw an immediate impact. We are now rapidly expanding to the rest of the radiologists in our practice.\n\nWeâve been incredibly pleased with the partnership that has developed with Rad AI. As a CIO, your aim is to make investments in technology that make a tangible difference throughout the practice. Once the Rad AI Impressions rollout began, the benefits spread 'word of mouth' style like a brushfire. The radiologists became the largest supporters of the product â touting the efficiency, quality and overall reduction in fatigue improvements amongst themselves. Expansion of the agreement was a no-brainer. I would strongly encourage any radiology practice CIO seeking an impactful AI investment to prioritize a relationship with Rad AI.\n\nRad AI is a tremendous partner and their AI solution improves quality, efficiency, and, ultimately, improves patient care. Personally, Rad AI is the first AI solution that made me appreciate the benefits of adopting AI â Iâm looking forward to seeing how AI can positively impact radiologists, practices, and health systems.\n\nAfter thoroughly evaluating numerous radiology AI solutions via our collaborative we believe Rad AI Impressions will provide the most impactful value proposition for our member groups. Rad AI impressions' automated impression generator extracted from the radiologistâs dictated findings not only results in enhanced report quality and efficiency, but also helps alleviate fatigue by the end of a shift.\n\nOur practice has been on the forefront of innovation in radiology, building on our heritage of leading the way with transformative technologies that ultimately prove to become the gold standard for radiology practices. We believe our partnership with Rad AI will enable us to maintain this type of technological leadership, and Rad AI Impressions will be a powerfully assistive tool for our radiologists.\n\nWe expanded our partnership with Rad AI to every radiologist not just because of the benefits our radiologists experienced, but also because the Rad AI team is incredible to work with. They truly listen and prioritize our feedback.\n\nOur initial group of radiologist users were very impressed by Rad AIâs ability to reduce fatigue and improve productivity using artificial intelligence, while improving the quality of patient care. We evaluate many AI vendors, and Rad AI proved to not only be a valuable solution our radiologists wanted to use, but theyâve also been a fantastic partner in helping us fully leverage the power of AI to do more for our patients.\n\nI knew from the first time I used Rad AI Impressions it would be a complete game-changer by allowing us to turn around the highest-quality reports faster with fewer addenda. Of all the technology and solutions that weâve implemented for our practice, Rad AI Impressions has made the biggest impact on our efficiency and quality. I have personally reached out to colleagues of mine to prioritize a partnership with Rad AI.",
      "# [SIIM 2024](https://www.radai.com/events/conferences/siim-2024)\nRad AI exceeded radiologist expectations out of the gate. Seamless integration permitted our radiologists to immediately realize the efficiencies of the Rad AI Impressions platform. With Rad AI, our radiologists reported feeling less stressed with more time available to review studies or tend to other tasks. This is exactly the type of IT solution needed to help reduce radiologistsâ burnout and boost job satisfaction.\n\nEven though Rad AI has an incredible reputation in the radiology community, we were hesitant to try AI in our practice and wanted to prove it out for ourselves. After using Rad AI Impressions with a small initial set of users, we are so glad we did as we saw an immediate impact. We are now rapidly expanding to the rest of the radiologists in our practice.\n\nWhile hard to measure in minutes or seconds or even dollars, one huge value is the \"coffee sip\" factor. Before Rad AI Impressions, I was talking all the time and my cup of coffee in the morning would inevitably get cold. With Rad AI impressions, I get just long enough of a break to take a sip of warm coffee. And each time I sip my warm coffee, I smile.\n\nRad AI is a tremendous partner and their AI solution improves quality, efficiency, and, ultimately, improves patient care. Personally, Rad AI is the first AI solution that made me appreciate the benefits of adopting AI â Iâm looking forward to seeing how AI can positively impact radiologists, practices, and health systems.\n\nIt gives you the ability to generate a complete report in the interpreting radiologist's own language, whether you use structured reporting or dictate freely, just by dictating the pertinent findings. This saves an enormous amount of wasted energy in having to create full sentences.\n\nUsing Rad AI Impressions to auto-generate my impressions has been wonderful. Iâve gotten to use it on overnight shifts, and itâs a game changer. It really helps with breezing through case volume with less fatigue.\n\nWe expanded our partnership with Rad AI to every radiologist not just because of the benefits our radiologists experienced, but also because the Rad AI team is incredible to work with.

      "# [Reimagining the Standup by Rad AI Engineering on 2024-05-22](https://eng.radai.com/p/reimagining-the-standup)\nStandups\n\nIt seems like every team that I’ve been on holds some flavor of daily “stand-up” meeting. Especially once hybrid and remote work became necessarily en vogue, a daily standing meeting seemed a panacea to a whole host of modern organizational ailments. Thus a new breed of meeting was born, justified with all the original big-meeting killing rationale of Agile™️ processes, but often missing the forest for the trees, driving teams back into the daily slump of boring meetings. It’s worth raising the question of whether your own well-meaning daily exercise has decayed into something that no longer serves its intended purpose - it happens easily!\n\nStand by me!\n\nAs my engineering dinosaur feathers grow in, I recall a distant time when my team would gather around our lead’s desk in a tight circle every day in the morning. Each of my teammates had straggled in, oriented themselves to what was on their plate for the day, and came ready to talk. We exchanged information with tight, cross-talking fluidity - and the name wasn’t a coincidence! It was an actual “standing” meeting, in that we would be on our feet, giving us all a little more pressure to keep the meeting quick, functional, and effective.\n\nFast forward a few years, and though most of the team was still in the same office, technology allowed teams to become vastly distributed across time and space. Remote communication made the distributed standup possible for the first time, but it became much trickier to pull off effectively. For one thing, there simply was no “first thing in the morning” that worked for everyone, so while SF engineers were just starting their day, folks on the East Coast were already finished with lunch. For a hybrid team, if part of the team WAS in-person, it meant the remote folks needed to be represented by a laptop or situated far against the wall on a screen. And for the remote callers on the other side of that screen, the daily ritual became entirely detached, with A/V issues often making their compatriots seem even further away. I remember being the guy on the screen when I first transitioned into a remote role - couldn’t help but feel like the kid standing just outside the circle on the playground.\n\nEventually, fully remote teams became far more the norm for me, and customary stand-ups followed, though by this point they had become something pretty far removed from the rose-tinted desk huddles of my distant memory. The daily video call was seen as an exercise de rigeur, even as its effectiveness dwindled.\n\nSo why are we still imposing this small daily burden? Well, it does have its good points…\n\nWhen it’s good\n\nTeam members can effectively communicate important status updates, speaking to a tight circle of relevant, interested, people. Information transfer happens fast, eliminating the need for folks to chase each other down later.\n\nManagers can predict team demands, paying attention to who needs to be unblocked, and arranging exceptional support, just in time.\n\nBy virtue of sharing every morning together, remote teams can build rapport, making the other informal communication that teams thrive on happen naturally.\n\nWhen it’s bad\n\nThe audience in the room has grown so large and generalized, that many people just aren’t concerned with a large portion of the others’ day-to-day work, and can’t even really remember what everyone has said even if they wanted to. Peripheral players get included just for the sake of inclusion and team building, even if their work is not relevant to others on a day-to-day basis. Meetings drag on endlessly so everyone gets their turn.\n\nTeam members start viewing their “share” as less of a way to exchange vital information others need, and more as a laundry list of boxes that have been, or will be checked.\n\nMost of the communication devolves into people speaking directly to their manager, with an inherent (usually false) assumption that every other team member is listening intently and effectively, absorbing each cumulative update.\n\nWhen it’s ugly\n\nThe standup is considered the one and only time during the day that the team gets together, and so starts filling the place of other, more casual and focused small group decision meetings. As the duration stretches out longer, participants’ attention wanders to the myriad distractions lying in other windows. Everyone looks effectively busy, while important decisions get lost in the chaos.\n\nManagers view the standup as an opportunity to re-prioritize an IC’s work on a day-to-day basis, eroding their pillar of autonomy before the first cup of coffee.\n\nStatus exchange effectiveness grinds to near zero, with team members having to chase each other down for followup conversations, despite holding a daily, expensive meeting\n\nWhat to do?\n\nKnowing that these meetings can quickly lose their effectiveness once a distributed team grows, what can be done to retain a stand-up meeting’s value?\n\nKeep the guest list tight\n\nOnce there are about 7 people in the circle, the group starts to reach the limits of attention and memory. One of our Engineering Managers, Catherine Fleres, likes to abide by the “Two-Pizza Rule” - if it takes more than that to adequately feed everyone in a meeting, there are too many people at the table! Strive to keep standup groups to just relevant stakeholders in a focused topic. Organize into squads, and split meetings ruthlessly. If there are other, larger team-wide broadcasts that need to be made, consider alternate channels or meeting formats.\n\nConsider actually standing\n\nTeammates think I’m crazy when I suggest this, because it involves an extremely awkward coordinated dance of adjusting cameras, changing desk heights, and just generally looking silly in a room alone. Strange as it seems, the physiological pressure of being in a less-than-leisurely body pose can help keep shares nice and short - direct and to the point.\n\nTake discussions offline… ruthlessly …\n\nIt starts innocently enough: a status update sparks a question, and the answer is detailed and complex, which sparks a follow-up from the original speaker. Before they even realize it, the two participants have taken the meeting off the rails, and everybody else’s eyes are slowly glazing over as they hash out the finer points. Develop a team culture for tabling those important conversations compassionately, and following up after the group has dispersed. It can feel rude to have to police this, so it’s especially important that everybody is bought in and held accountable, and understands a shared signal to move it along. Encourage followups to happen in a separate “space”, so that there is a clear signal that uninterested parties are not obligated to attend.\n\nOptimize for broadband communication\n\nStanding meetings can sometimes grow large to accommodate the schedule of a single individual who has become the hub from which all others are spokes. The entire meeting degrades from n to n communication to serial bursts of 1:1 exchanges with that single person. This is often indicative of larger organizational chokepoints, and a good hint it’s time to delegate responsibility more broadly and spread the load.\n\nMake space for other group collaboration\n\nIs the daily standup the only place where group communication happens on your team? Do decisions get rushed, because they have to be made while a roomful of disinterested folks wait for their turn? Do important announcements get forgotten, buried in a laundry list of mundane updates? Make room for the longer discussions, note their importance, and encourage them to happen in a properly framed meeting venue with strictly the interested parties.\n\nDouble down on autonomy\n\nIt’s common to justify a daily gathering as a way of tracking team accountability. Tickets closed, code merged, charts burnt down. Around the table, the ICs get the message that they need to justify their existence (perhaps to their manager?), and so their shares become a list of yesterday’s accomplishments. The meetings transform into a status dump for a theoretically rapt listener than effective team communication. Think about this - in your own daily meetings, to what audience is the speaker framing their share? Do participants seem like they’re collaborating and engaging with each other, or mostly to the manager? If your meeting culture expects every detail to be reported up the chain on a daily cadence, it can easily undermine an IC’s sense of work autonomy. It leaves the door open for unwelcome scrutiny, micro-management, and ultimately starts to wear on motivation and engagement.\n\nWhile managerial demands for daily status checks seem reasonable, they are often unnecessary, and reinforce the notion that work could deviate wildly from sprint plans at any time. I like the analogy to a cruise ship; you can make course corrections on the scale of sprint cycles, but the ship, like your dev’s psyches, may be too big to turn on a dime. Escaping the notion of “stand-up as status report” can help managers plan more realistically, and workers feel safe in predictable work expectations. Consider incorporating automated status tracking into organization tooling, so that a developer’s normal workflow triggers updates in a board or charts visible to managers. This can help alleviate the concern that work isn’t happening, even over the distances that remote teams require.\n\nIf all else fails, Slack up!\n\nA common solution to the woes of unfortunate stand-ups is to switch to an “async” model, where team members leave their updates in a Slack channel or other team collaboration tool, as they come online for the day. This format alleviates a lot of the pains of having to convey status to others without making awkward time demands, so is a favorite of the meeting-averse. However, this is hardly a suitable replacement. In theory, each team member is consuming everyone else’s updates, but in practice that rarely holds. The features that defined the format get lost - psychological pressure keeping updates brief and effective has vanished, the laundry list mentality gets exacerbated, and it’s way too easy to let the audience in the channel grow too large. This is often the last iteration of the meeting format before the whole exercise is scrapped as unhelpful.\n\nStanding together as a team\n\nWhether you’re analyzing user experience or plotting out team processes, success or failure depends greatly on how your stakeholders feel. When engineers report “feeling” burnout, often the first thing they call out is energy-sapping meetings - being held captive on camera while other people talk about irrelevant distractions. On the other hand, some teams will point to a daily meeting as the time they feel most like a single, sleek operating unit, and this carries through the rest of their day. A well-run standup can go a long way towards maintaining sanity in your schedule, realistic expectations of your peers, and predictable synergy on your team. Invest in doing it right.",

      "# [The Future of AI in Radiology](https://www.radai.com/webinars/the-future-of-ai-in-radiology)\nDr. Eliot Siegel, Vice Chair of Imaging Informatics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, joined Rad AI to discuss the future of AI in radiology. Dr. Sonia Gupta, AI thought leader and abdominal radiologist, moderated the discussion.\n\nDr. Gupta: Thank you to everyone who tuned into our webinar. I think it's really exciting for us to have this great turnout and shows how much engagement and excitement there is about AI in radiology.\n\nDr. Siegel began the discussion by describing where artificial intelligence will have the greatest impact in the near term.\n\nDr. Siegel: For me, the most important thing that AI can be applied to is actually the radiology report itself. So many developments in AI and natural language processing are allowing us to rethink the way we generate radiology reports and how we can do that more productively and efficiently. Thereâs incredible potential that we are not currently realizing to be able to significantly improve our efficiency and to reduce burnout as well.\n\nDr. Chang spoke about the impact Rad AI is having now in over 15% of the radiology market.\n\nDr. Chang: Rad AI Omni automatically generates the impression section of the radiology report, customized to each individual radiologist. It also handles automatic consensus guideline recommendations, helps with the automation of MIPS tracking (ensuring that the correct MIPS language is included in reports and improving billing language), reduces the need for addenda in reports, and provides error checking as well. We help radiologists by catching voice recognition typos, and other types of clinical errors in the report.Â\n\nSo this really saves radiologists time, reduces radiologist burnout, and improves the consistency and accuracy of reports. And because it gives you a little bit of a break after each complicated report, it makes people less stressed out -- it gives you a breather, so it reduces fatigue over the course of a day.Â\n\nDr. Gupta asked about how artificial intelligence can help serve as a virtual assistant for radiologists and reduce their burnout.\n\nDr. Gupta: At the same time that we have this increase in volume from the backlog of COVID-19, we also have decreasing reimbursement. And so unfortunately our survey data shows that 88% of US radiologists feel that they are at or over capacity and 25% of them say they're just unhappy being a radiologist.\n\nDr. Chang: When you're working really busy nights it's hard to always keep track of the incidental findings, always remember the different consensus guidelines and the latest recommendations, and be able to apply those appropriately at all times to create the best possible report.\n\nAnd so at Rad AI what we really tried to focus on is making sure to help the radiologist to be able to reduce the amount of cognitive load on every study so that we can automatically remember those incidental findings for you -- remember the consensus guideline recommendations to put them in automatically. That really helps alleviate some of the pressure from this high impact, non-stop imaging volume that we have on overnight shifts.Â\n\nFinally Dr. Siegel and Dr. Chang spoke about how artificial intelligence can help in closing the loop on significant incidental findings.\n\nDr. Siegel: We make so many findings, and so many recommendations, and so many suggestions for follow-up -- and yet there's not a mechanism to be able to track those.Â",

Dr. Sonia Gupta, AI thought leader and abdominal radiologist, moderated the discussion.\n\nDr. Gupta: We are very excited today to have a round table to discuss RANTâs adoption of Rad AI Omni for their over 225 radiologists. Theyâre one of the largest private radiology practices in Texas and one of the largest in the nation. Dr. Galante, what was your perspective watching this deployment?Â\n\nDr. Galante: It was thankfully very smooth and very straightforward. Rad AI is an intuitive product and itâs very plug and play and very user-friendly. Basically from day one, it just comes out of the box and starts doing its thing and working alongside you. I just dove right in, and I think a lot of others dove right in as well.\n\nDr. Gupta: Well, were you skeptical that it would do what it says itâs supposed to do? Or just about AI in general?\n\nDr. Galante: Anytime you hear such great reviews, it's kind of like when you go to Yelp and you're reading restaurant reviews and it's gotten five stars over 3000 reviews. I think it puts in any kind of flaw under such a microscope because you're almost looking for it; so I was skeptical because of the reviews that were all overwhelmingly positive. But, it's scary good. I do some reports that are free form, some that are templated and just across all of this, it is incredibly good at modeling my voice. Maybe one of the best pieces of feedback I've heard is that sometimes it kind of knows your impression before you know it...I was skeptical, but it has made me a believer!Â\n\nDr. Gupta: You also mentioned in our press release that Rad AI is the first AI solution that made you appreciate the benefits of using AI in your work. Can you tell us more about that?Â\n\nDr. Galante: It's provided a tailwind and itâs giving you a boost. And again, just out of the box, it creates a palpable difference. There's the peace of mind not having to sign and then saying, âOh, I forgot to include that pulmonary nodule, now Iâve got to put an addendumâ¦â And so it's bringing down those pertinent findings that on a long complex ED report, you might have not thought to put those incidentals.Â It's got a proof checking measure, as well...if there's something in their impression that just grammatically is incorrect, chances are that it is because that's how you dictated it in the Finding section. So it's got that internal proof check as well, which I think really helps.Â\n\nDr. Gupta: Dr. Galante, could you tell us what you like the best about using Rad AI during your shifts?\n\nDr. Galante: It absolutely reduces fatigue. You're speaking less words, you're expending less energy. Also, there's the mental fatigue of just performing a repetitive task over and over again, having to synthesize your thoughts and bring those down into your impression. and also more time on images. I think that ultimately you spend more time interpreting the study, looking at the images, and there's a certain peace of mind that comes with that as well.\n\nDr. Gupta: We were talking about how sometimes we would just feel like a zombie after a really busy call shift? Have you noticed a change for yourself?Â",
      "# [Battling Radiology Burnout Without Sacrificing Productivity](https://www.radai.com/blogs/battling-radiology-burnout-without-sacrificing-productivity)\nHow have radiology workloads changed in the past two decades?\n\nA recent case study of a large general hospital found that radiology RVUs rose from 6,187 in 2006 to 24,584 in 2020 (297% increase over 15 years).Â In the same time period, the number of radiology staff in the hospital remained stagnant, indicating that individual workloads increased significantly. Â The results of this study build on a prior report which noted an increase of 70.3% annual work RVUs per full-time equivalent radiologist from 1991â92 to 2006â07.Â Rapidly growing radiology workloads (defined as the product of the number and complexity of examinations performed per time unit) in the past 20 years can largely be attributed to technological developments including voice recognition software, picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), and advanced cross sectional imaging techniques.Â Another factor has been the widespread adoption of defensive medicine practices and consequent medical imaging overutilization.Â Global imaging volume is expected to double in the next eight years, so the trend of rising radiology RVU expectations will likely continue for the foreseeable future.Â Â\n\nWhat is burnout, and how does workload relate to radiologist burnout?\n\nThe Maslach Burnout Inventory is a highly established method of measuring burnout, and it considers three primary symptoms - emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low sense of personal accomplishment.Â Radiologists experiencing burnout often feel unmotivated for work and lack compassion for their patients.Â Therefore, it negatively impacts public health by adversely affecting physiciansâ clinical performance. Burnout can also contribute to absences from work, unprofessional behavior, unhealthy lifestyle habits, and premature retirement.Â Â\n\nIn 2016, the ACR Commission on Human Resources generated a list of ten risk factors for radiology burnout, which they ranked by an importance score determined by eight members on the commission.Â Reducing these factors is a shared responsibility between radiologists and health care organizations.Â Individual radiologists prevent burnout by striving to optimize their physical health, personal relationships, and pursuits outside of work.Â Seeking guidance from career coaches or mental health professionals when needed has also been shown to effectively reduce burnout rates.Â Organizations are responsible for acknowledging the problems contributing to burnout in their specific practices and encouraging open communication to cultivate a sense of collaboration and job control.Â Although social factors such as workplace isolation can be solved without modifying workloads, the two greatest factors of burnout, inadequate staffing and prolonged stress, both stem from workload expectations.Â Thus it is not surprising that increased workloads correlate with increased burnout rates.\n\nBack in 2003, an ACR study indicated that 93% of radiologists enjoyed their work.Â This was a higher level of satisfaction than most other physician specialties, but it was lower than the results of the equivalent 1995 ACR survey.Â Of the radiologists who reported low satisfaction in the study, more than half cited workload as a primary reason.Â Furthermore, radiologists who expressed dissatisfaction due to work overload felt the issue was serious enough that they were willing to accept proportionately lower income (i.e. take a 10% income cut for 10% reduction in workload).Â As with physicians overall, radiology job satisfaction has continued to decrease over time.Â Today more than 85% of US radiologists feel at or above full work capacity and approximately 70% of radiologists have experienced feelings of burnout.Â\n\nWhy hasnât AI already led to reduced radiology burnout rates?\n\nGeoffrey Hinton is a Turing Award winning computer scientist known as one of the âGodfathers of AI.âÂ Five years ago he declared, âWe should stop training radiologists now; itâs just completely obvious that within five years deep learning is going to do better than radiologists.âÂ Conversations about AI overtaking the work of radiologists have been so widespread throughout the past decade that it is now a factor for medical students moving away from radiology as their specialty choice. This discussion has only been further amplified by social media creating an inaccurate narrative around the speciality as easily replaceable with AI. However, current studies concede that previous speculations were overly optimistic and did not accurately consider regulatory processes and scarcity of training data.Â Â\n\nSince 2016, The FDA has approved 80+ AI algorithms for medical imaging, and ~30% of radiologists have adopted some form of AI into their practice.Â Most of these AI solutions have not lived up to the expectation of reducing the burden on radiologists.Â A group of Dutch researchers recently studied a random sample of 440 medical imaging studies published in 2019.Â They found that rather than being integrated into existing workflows and taking over tasks for radiologists, AI applications generally led to additional post-processing and interpretation time.Â As a result, 86% of AI-focused studies were actually associated with a higher workload for radiologists.Â Â\n\nHow is Rad AI Omni increasing efficiency and reducing burnout rates?\n\nRad AI Omni uses artificial intelligence to generate report impressions from dictated findings.Â Without adding a single click into existing workflows, Omni creates impressions which are customized to each radiologistâs language preferences in less than a couple seconds.Â Radiologists using Rad AI achieve time savings of an hour a day, allowing them to heighten their focus on the most specialized aspects of their work - expert imaging interpretation and diagnosis.Â Taking another look at the ACRâs list of risk factors for radiology burnout, the primary factor identified is inadequate staffing.Â Hiring more radiologists decreases workload by reducing the necessary productivity levels of each radiologist in the practice.Â Rad AI Omni instead minimizes the tedium and time required to read each study, thereby reducing workloads while maintaining or improving individual levels of productivity.Â Â",
      "# [Rad AI: Radiology Workflow-Focused AI](https://www.radai.com/blogs/rad-ai-radiology-workflow-focused-ai)\nThe lack of widespread adoption is multifactorial, explained in part by the cost and lack of reimbursement. The types of available algorithms likely also play a role in the lack of adoption. The majority of commercially available AI algorithms are imaging-focused, emphasizing triage of acute findings and providing a âsecond set of eyes.â Non-image interpretation AI solutions (scheduling, billing, workflow optimization, etc.) are less widely available.\n\nMy radiology group, Inland Imaging, is a private practice group in the Pacific Northwest consisting of over 100 radiologists, the vast majority of which are subspecialized. Despite evaluating numerous algorithms, we have not found an imaging-focused AI solution that âmoved the needleâ for our group. However, non-image interpretation AI solutions have the potential to make a meaningful impact, particularly solutions that streamline workflow and/or improve radiologist productivity.Â\n\nRad AI is an AI vendor whose primary product, Rad AI Omni, automatically generates the impression of radiology reports based on the findings. The algorithm is trained using thousands of reports for each individual radiologist and does surprisingly well mimicking the diction of the interpreting radiologist.Â\n\nDuring Inlandâs initial use of Rad AI, it quickly became apparent that Rad AI Omni provided a significant time savings in the generation of the report impression, which translates to an opportunity for increased radiologist productivity. In addition to the time savings, the solicited radiologist feedback demonstrated that Rad AI Omni helped to reduce fatigue and the feeling of burnout by automating some of the monotonous and repetitive portions of dictated reports.Â\n\nAs a neuroradiologist, one example of Rad AI Omni eliminating a repetitive and monotonous task is in the impression generation on cross sectional degenerative spine reports. Radiologists often have a standardized format and style for these reports, which suits Rad AI Omni perfectly. While the impressions on these reports can be quite long, Rad AI Omni quickly and reliably synthesizes the impression using the same diction as the interpreting radiologist. This allows the radiologist time for a âlast lookâ at the images. A normal workday may contain a dozen or more such reports. Different radiology subspecialties have similar examples of repetitive exams. Rad AI Omni excels in reducing the burden of these repetitive dictations, which reduces fatigue and leaves the radiologist feeling less drained at the end of the day.Â\n\nAnother product offered by Rad AI, called Rad AI Continuity, identifies and categorizes follow-up recommendations and confirms appropriateness and adherence to society guidelines. It then automates the communication of the recommendation to the patient and outpatient provider. Finally, it tracks adherence to follow-up recommendations and ensures that the loop is closed. Rad AI is constantly updating the Continuity program by adding tracking of new standardized follow-up recommendations. This automation and tracking results in increased compliance with clinically appropriate follow-up recommendations, improving quality and adding value to the radiologist work product.Â",

I've read horror stories on auntminnie and heard from other radiologists about PSOne, but I was actually impressed to see that it was actually even worse in practice than everyone was saying. I mean -- they eliminated keyboard shortcuts, the UI is disastrous, you need 5-6 extra clicks to do anything you could do in PS360, the macro and report editor is schizophrenic, adding random spaces, new lines, deleting them to the point that it honestly feels like a psychological experiment someone is playing on me, everything requires switching tabs now, you can't pull up the order page without it taking up half the screen, etc.\n\nNow, the one fucking thing that continues to drive me insane 50 times a day is -- clicking at the end of a sentence or anywhere after it (it seems this mostly happens in impression fields, since for some reason in the findings section it works normally, although just like everything in PSOne it is totally inconsistent behavior and sometimes does it, sometimes no), will put your cursor BEFORE the punctuation mark. So anything you say will just be added to the end of the last sentence BEFORE the period, completely fucking up your report. The only way to fix this is, no matter where you click, you then have to press right arrow to get to after the period. How the FUCKKKKKKK was this missed in testing? Like, how the fuck are we supposed to dictate?\n\nHas ANYONE found a solution for this behavior? I am wondering if like, maybe you need some kind of special impression field, some formatting, who the fuck knows. I also wouldn't be surprised if other people using PSOne don't experience this, because the software is THAT fucking inconsistent.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n## Comment ID kc7nmgx with +7 score by [(MocoMojo, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Radiology/comments/18bymqt/powerscribe_one_are_you_for_real/kc7nmgx/) (in reply to ID 18bymqt):\nIt’s horrible. \n\nIn addition, our PACS (Visage) now crashes 2-4 times a day (the is never happened with PS360).\n\n### Comment ID kc7qy0x with +3 score by [(tell_her_a_story, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Radiology/comments/18bymqt/powerscribe_one_are_you_for_real/kc7qy0x/) (in reply to ID kc7nmgx):\nWe're running Sectra with PS One, seeing at least 4 crashes per day on average.

Yeah we got Visage so it's a net upgrade overall but oh my god, why couldn't they just keep PS360.

Am told by vendor that new UX version received a service patch in last few months and has now been getting good reviews, with a lot of the issues discussed in this thread being fixed.

While the typical start-up culture of sexual harassment does not exist (truly a wonderful job of that), there are many, many micro-aggressions against women. Also, some \"favorite\" mid-level leaders treat other teammates terribly.

Knowing the heart of many people - I really tried to dismiss this. It quickly became clear that the expectation was for women to do the women's work. Heavy lifting before, during, and after events would be left to only female team members. Leadership would come halfway through the event, not acknowledge them, and leave before the event was over, often in dangerous cities or situations without offering to help. It's been elevated to the point that other companies noticed and offered to stay behind to ensure they had the necessary help. Leaders often complained about spending time with team members and repeatedly said they didn't like team-building activities, conferences, etc. Often, ideas and projects from the only female team member are claimed by other team members. Female team members are cut off in meetings, and important initiatives are not supported by leadership that is assigned to female team members. I would also caution you to provide feedback in the weekly employee surveys. Shortly after, a few began sharing their dissatisfaction; it was brought up in team meetings about \"negativity,\" and they were let go shortly after. A few \"favorites\" play games - what they say in private slack messages and publically are wildly different and borderline harassing. They will be publically praised in all team meetings while their abusive behavior towards other teammates is ignored. I truly don't think they are aware of the microaggressions (and likely could be addressed). Still, a few people on the team do the most outwardly blatantly toxic behaviors privately, and senior leadership is likely unaware. But because those individuals are constantly being praised \"as the only people on the team doing things correctly\" it isn't possible to bring up concerns.",

All meetings are recorded as the leadership cannot trust their employees to do work. It is amazing how much time people spend playing politics when there is not even a working product nor a market fit yet.\r\n\r\nAnimosity between cofounders as the CFO has taken over as CEO. While they claim that the company was built by radiologists for radiologists, the radiologist / ex-CEO has no power, always working alone at a corner of the office away from other employees. \"Automate radiologists' paycheck\" is the true culture of the company. Condescending memes about radiologists are posted publicly. The ML team is heavily inflated with a lot of ego. Be prepared to make avocado toasts for your manager. Their AI does not work and they cover up their flaws by not having tests, blotching usage stat, and blaming the radiologists for not being \"consistent\".\r\n\r\nThe current CEO has assembled an executive team of yes-people who are willing to play his game and support him no matter what. While they have no real autonomy, they are rewarded with promotions beyond their experience or competence. If you dare to disagree with him, you'd be ushered out of the back door. The day when shelter-in-place was in order, he was enraged and said \"Why don't we let the people who is going to die, die, instead of ruining the economy?!\" Employees who criticized his handling of COVID were layoff a week later due to \"performance issues\".\r\n\r\nXenophobic and sexist comments get toasted around regularly.

While they claim that the company was built by radiologists for radiologists, the radiologist / ex-CEO has no power, always working alone at a corner of the office away from other employees. \"Automate radiologists' paycheck\" is the true culture of the company. Condescending memes about radiologists are posted publicly. The ML team is heavily inflated with a lot of ego. Be prepared to make avocado toasts for your manager. Their AI does not work and they cover up their flaws by not having tests, blotching usage stat, and blaming the radiologists for not being \"consistent\".\r\n\r\nThe current CEO has assembled an executive team of yes-people who are willing to play his game and support him no matter what. While they have no real autonomy, they are rewarded with promotions beyond their experience or competence. If you dare to disagree with him, you'd be ushered out of the back door. The day when shelter-in-place was in order, he was enraged and said \"Why don't we let the people who is going to die, die, instead of ruining the economy?!\" Employees who criticized his handling of COVID were layoff a week later due to \"performance issues\".\r\n\r\nXenophobic and sexist comments get toasted around regularly.

While the typical start-up culture of sexual harassment does not exist (truly a wonderful job of that), there are many, many micro-aggressions against women. Also, some \"favorite\" mid-level leaders treat other teammates terribly.

This is going to breed a toxic, toxic culture if not quickly addressed.",
        "cons": "Everything started great - until I realized the lack of women in leadership positions. (Take a look at the website). Knowing the heart of many people - I really tried to dismiss this. It quickly became clear that the expectation was for women to do the women's work. Heavy lifting before, during, and after events would be left to only female team members. Leadership would come halfway through the event, not acknowledge them, and leave before the event was over, often in dangerous cities or situations without offering to help. It's been elevated to the point that other companies noticed and offered to stay behind to ensure they had the necessary help. Leaders often complained about spending time with team members and repeatedly said they didn't like team-building activities, conferences, etc. Often, ideas and projects from the only female team member are claimed by other team members. Female team members are cut off in meetings, and important initiatives are not supported by leadership that is assigned to female team members. I would also caution you to provide feedback in the weekly employee surveys. Shortly after, a few began sharing their dissatisfaction; it was brought up in team meetings about \"negativity,\" and they were let go shortly after. A few \"favorites\" play games - what they say in private slack messages and publically are wildly different and borderline harassing. They will be publically praised in all team meetings while their abusive behavior towards other teammates is ignored. I truly don't think they are aware of the microaggressions (and likely could be addressed). Still, a few people on the team do the most outwardly blatantly toxic behaviors privately, and senior leadership is likely unaware. But because those individuals are constantly being praised \"as the only people on the team doing things correctly\" it isn't possible to bring up concerns.",

      "# [Save Time and Decrease Burnout with Radiology AI Software](https://www.radai.com/)\nRad AI Continuity is the most comprehensive follow-up management platform on the market, tracking more than 50 categories of incidental findings and significantly increasing patient follow-up rates. Weâre very excited about this collaboration as it will allow us to have improved visibility and provide a safety net over our entire patient population to ensure our patients feel informed and empowered.\n\nWith Continuity, we have a 100% radiology safety net. Every single radiology report that comes in with an incidental finding has been communicated to the appropriate stakeholders. We're tracking whether or not those follow-ups happen within the appropriate, recommended timeframe mitigating all our liability to ensure that we keep patients in our network.\n\nThe amazing thing about Rad AI Reporting is that you're able to achieve exponential efficiency gains, but with less perceived effort. It doesn't benefit you if you're going faster but you know you're going fast because you're more fatigued. The idea is to smooth things out in a way where you're almost in a flow state, and Rad AI Reporting does that.\n\nHaving greatly benefited from using Rad AI Impressions, we are thrilled to add Continuity to our current partnership with the team at Rad AI. The management of incidental findings in radiology reports is a key focus for our group as itâs incredibly beneficial for the patients we serve. After evaluating every vendor in this space, we found that Continuity provides the most automated and most comprehensive solution in follow-up management.\n\nIt gives you the ability to generate a complete report in the interpreting radiologist's own language, whether you use structured reporting or dictate freely, just by dictating the pertinent findings. This saves an enormous amount of wasted energy in having to create full sentences.\n\nRad AI Impressions is what we have all been waiting for! Providing much-needed efficiency gains in my daily workflow life is sometimes absolutely surreal! It is like I have my own trainee who perfectly excels at impressions.\n\nUsing Rad AI Impressions to auto-generate my impressions has been wonderful. Iâve gotten to use it on overnight shifts, and itâs a game changer. It really helps with breezing through case volume with less fatigue.\n\nWhile hard to measure in minutes or seconds or even dollars, one huge value is the \"coffee sip\" factor. Before Rad AI Impressions, I was talking all the time and my cup of coffee in the morning would inevitably get cold. With Rad AI impressions, I get just long enough of a break to take a sip of warm coffee. And each time I sip my warm coffee, I smile.\n\nRad AI exceeded radiologist expectations out of the gate. Seamless integration permitted our radiologists to immediately realize the efficiencies of the Rad AI Impressions platform. With Rad AI, our radiologists reported feeling less stressed with more time available to review studies or tend to other tasks. This is exactly the type of IT solution needed to help reduce radiologistsâ burnout and boost job satisfaction.\n\nHaving greatly benefited from using Rad AI Impressions, we are thrilled to add Continuity to our current partnership with the team at Rad AI. The management of incidental findings in radiology reports is a key focus for our group as itâs incredibly beneficial for the patients we serve. After evaluating every vendor in this space, we found that Continuity provides the most automated and most comprehensive solution in follow-up management.\n\nWe have seen how critical it is to close the loop on significant incidental findings and what a challenging problem it is to address using our currently available resources. By automating the majority of steps related to patient follow-ups, Rad AI removes those manual tasks from our clinical team and gives them back more time to focus on caring for their patients.\n\nWhen we recently discussed our expansions and renewals for AI solutions, we saw Rad AI as a must-have. If we were to rank our solutions, it's at the top. With a high volume of high acuity cases, Rad AI Impressions helps us manage our caseload. The performance continues to improve -- in 90 to 95% of the impressions that it generates, I don't have to edit anything, and the consensus guideline recommendations are working really well.\n\nWe are committed to the patients and healthcare entities we serve, and we believe that partnering with Rad AI will improve the efficiency of our radiologists and increase the value associated with our services. We look forward to using Rad AI Impressions' automated impression technology to make our radiologists more effective and to help decrease burnout.\n\nRad AI Impressions will assist our radiologists in providing the highest-quality reports, while greatly reducing the rework that is built into the process. Weâre excited to partner with Rad AI, as the feedback weâve received from other Strategic Radiology members nationally has been overwhelmingly positive, and weâre looking forward to the same experience at our practice.\n\nWeâve been incredibly pleased with the partnership that has developed with Rad AI. As a CIO, your aim is to make investments in technology that make a tangible difference throughout the practice. Once the Rad AI Impressions rollout began, the benefits spread 'word of mouth' style like a brushfire. The radiologists became the largest supporters of the product â touting the efficiency, quality and overall reduction in fatigue improvements amongst themselves. Expansion of the agreement was a no-brainer. I would strongly encourage any radiology practice CIO seeking an impactful AI investment to prioritize a relationship with Rad AI.\n\nEven though Rad AI has an incredible reputation in the radiology community, we were hesitant to try AI in our practice and wanted to prove it out for ourselves. After using Rad AI Impressions with a small initial set of users, we are so glad we did as we saw an immediate impact. We are now rapidly expanding to the rest of the radiologists in our practice.\n\nAfter thoroughly evaluating numerous radiology AI solutions via our collaborative we believe Rad AI Impressions will provide the most impactful value proposition for our member groups. Rad AI impressions' automated impression generator extracted from the radiologistâs dictated findings not only results in enhanced report quality and efficiency, but also helps alleviate fatigue by the end of a shift.\n\nI knew from the first time I used Rad AI Impressions it would be a complete game-changer by allowing us to turn around the highest-quality reports faster with fewer addenda. Of all the technology and solutions that weâve implemented for our practice, Rad AI Impressions has made the biggest impact on our efficiency and quality. I have personally reached out to colleagues of mine to prioritize a partnership with Rad AI.\n\nOur practice has been on the forefront of innovation in radiology, building on our heritage of leading the way with transformative technologies that ultimately prove to become the gold standard for radiology practices. We believe our partnership with Rad AI will enable us to maintain this type of technological leadership, and Rad AI Impressions will be a powerfully assistive tool for our radiologists.\n\nWe expanded our partnership with Rad AI to every radiologist not just because of the benefits our radiologists experienced, but also because the Rad AI team is incredible to work with. They truly listen and prioritize our feedback.\n\nOur initial group of radiologist users were very impressed by Rad AIâs ability to reduce fatigue and improve productivity using artificial intelligence, while improving the quality of patient care. We evaluate many AI vendors, and Rad AI proved to not only be a valuable solution our radiologists wanted to use, but theyâve also been a fantastic partner in helping us fully leverage the power of AI to do more for our patients.\n\nItâs important to Inland Imaging to remain at the forefront of implementing groundbreaking technology to best serve our patients and provide the optimal environment for our radiologists to do their best work. Our radiologists are impressed with the efficiency gains, quality gains, and reduction in fatigue. Rad AI is an ideal partner that is both innovative and customer-focused, and places a premium on developing long-term partnerships.\n\nRad AI has made a big difference in my daily productivity and endurance throughout my day. I am now less mentally fatigued towards the end of my day because I do not have the added mental strain of summarizing my findings in the impression. The program does it for me. I also find myself catching more voice recognition errors when I read over the generated impression which allows me to go back and fix these errors in the body of the reportâ¦ an added bonus!",

      "# [Rapidly Growing Radiology AI Company, Rad AI, Strikes Partnership With Google Cloud by Dr. Sai Balasubramanian, M.D., J.D, Dr. Sai Balasubramanian, M.D, J.D on 2024-01-16](https://www.forbes.com/sites/saibala/2024/01/16/rapidly-growing-radiology-ai-company-rad-ai-strikes-partnership-with-google-cloud/)\nOne of the most rapidly growing startups at the intersections of technology, artificial intelligence and radiology, Rad AI, announced today that it will be partnering with Google Cloud in scaling its efforts to improve clinical radiologists’ workflows and mitigate burnout. The company has numerous offerings and is perhaps most well-known for its Reporting and Omni Impressions platforms, both of which have been developed as a means to augment clinician productivity. For example, Rad AI Omni Impressions automatically generates report impressions once the raw findings have been dictated by the radiologist. The key differentiator of this technology is that the platform continuously learns from each user and generates a personalized output that is in the stylistic tone and literary voice of each individual radiologist.\n\nThe company’s partnership with Google Cloud will provide an opportunity to scale its technology by leveraging Google’s platform, MedLM foundation models and its cloud services. MedLM, a family of foundation models fine-tuned for healthcare applications, will especially help unlock a significant amount of potential for the company by increasing the accuracy of reports, improving stylistic customizations and contributing to workflow optimization.\n\nThough Rad AI is relatively young, it has seen significant investment and interest; its Series A funding round alone involved nearly $25 million, and the company is now working with nearly 30% of the radiology services market in the United States.\n\nDoktor Gurson, Co-founder and CEO of Rad AI, enthusiastically explains that the company has been built by radiologists for radiologists with a few ambitious goals: reduce radiologist burnout, improve clinical workflows and ultimately, make a positive impact on clinical care delivery. He also explains that the partnership with Google Cloud is an important step forward for the company in its growth journey: “Rad AI brings the domain expertise in radiology, and Google Cloud’s MedLM now gives us the opportunity to level up and push further.”\n\nAashima Gupta, Global Director, Healthcare Strategy and Solutions at Google Cloud, explains that there is significant opportunity in the field of radiology to leverage artificial intelligence technology and generate content for the purposes of ultimately improving the care delivery process: “as the amount of medical imaging grows, we can equip radiologists with more robust platforms and technologies to make their workflows more efficient and accurate.”\n\nGupta alludes to an important aspect about the field of radiology; a key study in the European Journal of Radiology found that there has been a significant overall increase in the use of radiological imaging and corresponding workload for radiologists over the past 16 years. Another study published in Academic Radiology took a deep dive into causative factors for burnout in radiologists and found numerous systemic and workflow factors leading to increasing levels of attrition.\n\nBut the healthcare ecosystem cannot afford to lose radiologists due to burnout, given just how essential this function is for patient care. This is why companies are heavily investing with an unprecedented focus on radiology, hoping to leverage the latest in artificial intelligence technology. Notably, scientists and leaders are approaching this phenomenon cautiously: extensive studies are being conducted and funded to measure the efficacy of AI in radiology and its levels of accuracy. Regarding this factor, Gurson emphasizes that even with technologies such as Rad AI, it will ultimately be important for a human radiologist to review the outputs and provide the final sign-off, keeping the “human in the loop.”\n\nNevertheless, these are just early days for the intersection of artificial intelligence and radiology. Undoubtedly, the scale and speed at which this technology is growing indicates that there is still a lot of work to be done; however, if executed correctly, there is significant promise to potentially create positive impact.",

      "# [Rad AI, a startup that helps radiologists save time on report generation, raises $50M Series B from Khosla Ventures by Marina Temkin on 2024-05-07](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/07/rad-ai-a-startup-that-helps-radiologists-save-time-on-report-generation-raises-50m-series-b-from-khosla-ventures/)\nIn 2017, Vinod Khosla told CNBC that the job “of the radiologist will be obsolete in five years.” While the founder of Khosla Ventures later revised that timeline to as long as 15 years, he maintained that AI image recognition could soon diagnose disease on scans better than human doctors.\n\nSeven years later, radiologists are still required to interpret most scans (even if AI software helps them); the more immediate challenge is the shortage of these doctors in the United States and around the world.\n\nWhile Khosla Ventures has backed several imaging startups, including Vista.ai and Q Bio, the firm’s latest bet is on a company that makes radiologists’ workload easier by reducing the time spent on report documentation, instead of trying to replace the physician with a machine.\n\nOn Tuesday, Khosla led a $50 million Series B into Rad AI, which developed a tool that can generate reports for radiologists. Other participants in the round included World Innovation Lab and returning investors ARTIS Ventures, OCV Partners, Kickstart Fund and Gradient Ventures (Google’s AI-focused fund). The financing brought the company’s total capital raised to over $80 million.\n\nRad AI was founded in 2018 by Dr. Jeff Chang, who completed his medical training as a radiologist when he was 16 and later received an MBA from UCLA, and serial entrepreneur Doktor Gurson.\n\nSince Chang knew from his own experience as a practicing doctor that the majority of radiologists’ time is spent documenting findings rather than analyzing images, the pair decided to develop a proprietary LLM trained on radiology report datasets for automating doctors’ findings and impressions documentation.\n\nWhile tech companies didn’t widely use generative AI until OpenAI’s ChatGPT burst onto the scene in 2022, Rad AI takes pride in being an early adopter of this technology. “I’m confident we’re the first company in radiology to start using LLMs,” Gurson, Rad AI’s CEO told TechCrunch. “We started doing that work in 2018, around the same time that open AI was creating their [first] models.”\n\nSix years later, Rad AI’s products are used by about a third of U.S. health systems and nine of the 10 largest radiology groups in the country, Gurson said.\n\nThe fresh capital will be used to build a team that deploys Rad AI’s latest product: a standalone radiology reporting solution.\n\n“We have a lot of interest, but there’s only so much we can deploy at once,” Gurson said, adding that Rad AI is hiring people who can install and maintain the software.\n\nSome incumbents have been trying to add GenAI functionality to their radiology reporting software over the past 18 months, but Rad AI doesn’t consider these companies to be true competitors yet.\n\n“At this point, probably 99% to 100% of the market uses our products,” he said. “If it’s any indication, we’ve not lost a single customer since we started.”"
