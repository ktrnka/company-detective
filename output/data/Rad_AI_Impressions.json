      "# [Save Time and Decrease Burnout with Radiology AI Software](https://www.radai.com/)\nRad AI Continuity is the most comprehensive follow-up management platform on the market, tracking more than 50 categories of incidental findings and significantly increasing patient follow-up rates. Weâre very excited about this collaboration as it will allow us to have improved visibility and provide a safety net over our entire patient population to ensure our patients feel informed and empowered.\n\nWith Continuity, we have a 100% radiology safety net. Every single radiology report that comes in with an incidental finding has been communicated to the appropriate stakeholders. We're tracking whether or not those follow-ups happen within the appropriate, recommended timeframe mitigating all our liability to ensure that we keep patients in our network.\n\nThe amazing thing about Rad AI Reporting is that you're able to achieve exponential efficiency gains, but with less perceived effort. It doesn't benefit you if you're going faster but you know you're going fast because you're more fatigued. The idea is to smooth things out in a way where you're almost in a flow state, and Rad AI Reporting does that.\n\nHaving greatly benefited from using Rad AI Impressions, we are thrilled to add Continuity to our current partnership with the team at Rad AI. The management of incidental findings in radiology reports is a key focus for our group as itâs incredibly beneficial for the patients we serve. After evaluating every vendor in this space, we found that Continuity provides the most automated and most comprehensive solution in follow-up management.\n\nIt gives you the ability to generate a complete report in the interpreting radiologist's own language, whether you use structured reporting or dictate freely, just by dictating the pertinent findings. This saves an enormous amount of wasted energy in having to create full sentences.\n\nRad AI Impressions is what we have all been waiting for! Providing much-needed efficiency gains in my daily workflow life is sometimes absolutely surreal! It is like I have my own trainee who perfectly excels at impressions.\n\nUsing Rad AI Impressions to auto-generate my impressions has been wonderful. Iâve gotten to use it on overnight shifts, and itâs a game changer. It really helps with breezing through case volume with less fatigue.\n\nWhile hard to measure in minutes or seconds or even dollars, one huge value is the \"coffee sip\" factor. Before Rad AI Impressions, I was talking all the time and my cup of coffee in the morning would inevitably get cold. With Rad AI impressions, I get just long enough of a break to take a sip of warm coffee. And each time I sip my warm coffee, I smile.\n\nRad AI exceeded radiologist expectations out of the gate. Seamless integration permitted our radiologists to immediately realize the efficiencies of the Rad AI Impressions platform. With Rad AI, our radiologists reported feeling less stressed with more time available to review studies or tend to other tasks. This is exactly the type of IT solution needed to help reduce radiologistsâ burnout and boost job satisfaction.\n\nHaving greatly benefited from using Rad AI Impressions, we are thrilled to add Continuity to our current partnership with the team at Rad AI. The management of incidental findings in radiology reports is a key focus for our group as itâs incredibly beneficial for the patients we serve. After evaluating every vendor in this space, we found that Continuity provides the most automated and most comprehensive solution in follow-up management.\n\nWe have seen how critical it is to close the loop on significant incidental findings and what a challenging problem it is to address using our currently available resources. By automating the majority of steps related to patient follow-ups, Rad AI removes those manual tasks from our clinical team and gives them back more time to focus on caring for their patients.\n\nWhen we recently discussed our expansions and renewals for AI solutions, we saw Rad AI as a must-have. If we were to rank our solutions, it's at the top. With a high volume of high acuity cases, Rad AI Impressions helps us manage our caseload. The performance continues to improve -- in 90 to 95% of the impressions that it generates, I don't have to edit anything, and the consensus guideline recommendations are working really well.\n\nWe are committed to the patients and healthcare entities we serve, and we believe that partnering with Rad AI will improve the efficiency of our radiologists and increase the value associated with our services. We look forward to using Rad AI Impressions' automated impression technology to make our radiologists more effective and to help decrease burnout.\n\nRad AI Impressions will assist our radiologists in providing the highest-quality reports, while greatly reducing the rework that is built into the process. Weâre excited to partner with Rad AI, as the feedback weâve received from other Strategic Radiology members nationally has been overwhelmingly positive, and weâre looking forward to the same experience at our practice.\n\nWeâve been incredibly pleased with the partnership that has developed with Rad AI. As a CIO, your aim is to make investments in technology that make a tangible difference throughout the practice. Once the Rad AI Impressions rollout began, the benefits spread 'word of mouth' style like a brushfire. The radiologists became the largest supporters of the product â touting the efficiency, quality and overall reduction in fatigue improvements amongst themselves. Expansion of the agreement was a no-brainer. I would strongly encourage any radiology practice CIO seeking an impactful AI investment to prioritize a relationship with Rad AI.\n\nEven though Rad AI has an incredible reputation in the radiology community, we were hesitant to try AI in our practice and wanted to prove it out for ourselves. After using Rad AI Impressions with a small initial set of users, we are so glad we did as we saw an immediate impact. We are now rapidly expanding to the rest of the radiologists in our practice.\n\nAfter thoroughly evaluating numerous radiology AI solutions via our collaborative we believe Rad AI Impressions will provide the most impactful value proposition for our member groups. Rad AI impressions' automated impression generator extracted from the radiologistâs dictated findings not only results in enhanced report quality and efficiency, but also helps alleviate fatigue by the end of a shift.\n\nI knew from the first time I used Rad AI Impressions it would be a complete game-changer by allowing us to turn around the highest-quality reports faster with fewer addenda. Of all the technology and solutions that weâve implemented for our practice, Rad AI Impressions has made the biggest impact on our efficiency and quality. I have personally reached out to colleagues of mine to prioritize a partnership with Rad AI.\n\nOur practice has been on the forefront of innovation in radiology, building on our heritage of leading the way with transformative technologies that ultimately prove to become the gold standard for radiology practices. We believe our partnership with Rad AI will enable us to maintain this type of technological leadership, and Rad AI Impressions will be a powerfully assistive tool for our radiologists.\n\nWe expanded our partnership with Rad AI to every radiologist not just because of the benefits our radiologists experienced, but also because the Rad AI team is incredible to work with. They truly listen and prioritize our feedback.\n\nOur initial group of radiologist users were very impressed by Rad AIâs ability to reduce fatigue and improve productivity using artificial intelligence, while improving the quality of patient care. We evaluate many AI vendors, and Rad AI proved to not only be a valuable solution our radiologists wanted to use, but theyâve also been a fantastic partner in helping us fully leverage the power of AI to do more for our patients.\n\nItâs important to Inland Imaging to remain at the forefront of implementing groundbreaking technology to best serve our patients and provide the optimal environment for our radiologists to do their best work. Our radiologists are impressed with the efficiency gains, quality gains, and reduction in fatigue. Rad AI is an ideal partner that is both innovative and customer-focused, and places a premium on developing long-term partnerships.\n\nRad AI has made a big difference in my daily productivity and endurance throughout my day. I am now less mentally fatigued towards the end of my day because I do not have the added mental strain of summarizing my findings in the impression. The program does it for me. I also find myself catching more voice recognition errors when I read over the generated impression which allows me to go back and fix these errors in the body of the reportâ¦ an added bonus!",

      "# [SIIM 2023](https://www.radai.com/events/conferences/siim-2023)\nWhen we recently discussed our expansions and renewals for AI solutions, we saw Rad AI as a must-have. If we were to rank our solutions, it's at the top. With a high volume of high acuity cases, Rad AI Impressions helps us manage our caseload. The performance continues to improve -- in 90 to 95% of the impressions that it generates, I don't have to edit anything, and the consensus guideline recommendations are working really well.\n\nEven though Rad AI has an incredible reputation in the radiology community, we were hesitant to try AI in our practice and wanted to prove it out for ourselves. After using Rad AI Impressions with a small initial set of users, we are so glad we did as we saw an immediate impact. We are now rapidly expanding to the rest of the radiologists in our practice.\n\nWeâve been incredibly pleased with the partnership that has developed with Rad AI. As a CIO, your aim is to make investments in technology that make a tangible difference throughout the practice. Once the Rad AI Impressions rollout began, the benefits spread 'word of mouth' style like a brushfire. The radiologists became the largest supporters of the product â touting the efficiency, quality and overall reduction in fatigue improvements amongst themselves. Expansion of the agreement was a no-brainer. I would strongly encourage any radiology practice CIO seeking an impactful AI investment to prioritize a relationship with Rad AI.\n\nRad AI is a tremendous partner and their AI solution improves quality, efficiency, and, ultimately, improves patient care. Personally, Rad AI is the first AI solution that made me appreciate the benefits of adopting AI â Iâm looking forward to seeing how AI can positively impact radiologists, practices, and health systems.\n\nAfter thoroughly evaluating numerous radiology AI solutions via our collaborative we believe Rad AI Impressions will provide the most impactful value proposition for our member groups. Rad AI impressions' automated impression generator extracted from the radiologistâs dictated findings not only results in enhanced report quality and efficiency, but also helps alleviate fatigue by the end of a shift.\n\nOur practice has been on the forefront of innovation in radiology, building on our heritage of leading the way with transformative technologies that ultimately prove to become the gold standard for radiology practices. We believe our partnership with Rad AI will enable us to maintain this type of technological leadership, and Rad AI Impressions will be a powerfully assistive tool for our radiologists.\n\nWe expanded our partnership with Rad AI to every radiologist not just because of the benefits our radiologists experienced, but also because the Rad AI team is incredible to work with. They truly listen and prioritize our feedback.\n\nOur initial group of radiologist users were very impressed by Rad AIâs ability to reduce fatigue and improve productivity using artificial intelligence, while improving the quality of patient care. We evaluate many AI vendors, and Rad AI proved to not only be a valuable solution our radiologists wanted to use, but theyâve also been a fantastic partner in helping us fully leverage the power of AI to do more for our patients.\n\nI knew from the first time I used Rad AI Impressions it would be a complete game-changer by allowing us to turn around the highest-quality reports faster with fewer addenda. Of all the technology and solutions that weâve implemented for our practice, Rad AI Impressions has made the biggest impact on our efficiency and quality. I have personally reached out to colleagues of mine to prioritize a partnership with Rad AI.",
      "# [Reimagining the Standup](https://www.radai.com/blogs/reimagining-the-standup)\nStandups\n\nIt seems like every team that Iâve been on holds some flavor of daily âstand-upâ meeting. Especially once hybrid and remote work became necessarily en vogue, a daily standing meeting seemed a panacea to a whole host of modern organizational ailments. Thus a new breed of meeting was born, justified with all the original big-meeting killing rationale of Agileâ¢ï¸ processes, but often missing the forest for the trees, driving teams back into the daily slump of boring meetings. Itâs worth raising the question of whether your own well-meaning daily exercise has decayed into something that no longer serves its intended purpose - it happens easily!\n\nStand by me!\n\nAs my engineering dinosaur feathers grow in, I recall a distant time when my team would gather around our leadâs desk in a tight circle every day in the morning. Each of my teammates had straggled in, oriented themselves to what was on their plate for the day, and came ready to talk. We exchanged information with tight, cross-talking fluidity - and the name wasnât a coincidence! It was an actual âstandingâ meeting, in that we would be on our feet, giving us all a little more pressure to keep the meeting quick, functional, and effective.\n\nFast forward a few years, and though most of the team was still in the same office, technology allowed teams to become vastly distributed across time and space. Remote communication made the distributed standup possible for the first time, but it became much trickier to pull off effectively. For one thing, there simply was no âfirst thing in the morningâ that worked for everyone, so while SF engineers were just starting their day, folks on the East Coast were already finished with lunch. For a hybrid team, if part of the team WAS in-person, it meant the remote folks needed to be represented by a laptop or situated far against the wall on a screen. And for the remote callers on the other side of that screen, the daily ritual became entirely detached, with A/V issues often making their compatriots seem even further away. I remember being the guy on the screen when I first transitioned into a remote role - couldnât help but feel like the kid standing just outside the circle on the playground.\n\nEventually, fully remote teams became far more the norm for me, and customary stand-ups followed, though by this point they had become something pretty far removed from the rose-tinted desk huddles of my distant memory. The daily video call was seen as an exercise de rigeur, even as its effectiveness dwindled.\n\nSo why are we still imposing this small daily burden? Well, it does have its good pointsâ¦\n\nWhen it's bad\n\nThe audience in the room has grown so large and generalized, that many people just arenât concerned with a large portion of the othersâ day-to-day work, and canât even really remember what everyone has said even if they wanted to. Peripheral players get included just for the sake of inclusion and team building, even if their work is not relevant to others on a day-to-day basis. Meetings drag on endlessly so everyone gets their turn.\n\nTeam members start viewing their âshareâ as less of a way to exchange vital information others need, and more as a laundry list of boxes that have been, or will be checked.\n\nMost of the communication devolves into people speaking directly to their manager, with an inherent (usually false) assumption that every other team member is listening intently and effectively, absorbing each cumulative update.\n\nWhen itâs ugly\n\nThe standup is considered the one and only time during the day that the team gets together, and so starts filling the place of other, more casual and focused small group decision meetings. As the duration stretches out longer, participantsâ attention wanders to the myriad distractions lying in other windows. Everyone looks effectively busy, while important decisions get lost in the chaos.\n\nManagers view the standup as an opportunity to re-prioritize an ICâs work on a day-to-day basis, eroding their pillar of autonomy before the first cup of coffee.\n\nStatus exchange effectiveness grinds to near zero, with team members having to chase each other down for followup conversations, despite holding a daily, expensive meeting\n\nWhat to do?\n\nKnowing that these meetings can quickly lose their effectiveness once a distributed team grows, what can be done to retain a stand-up meetingâs value?\n\nKeep the guest list tight\n\nOnce there are about 7 people in the circle, the group starts to reach the limits of attention and memory. One of our Engineering Managers, Catherine Fleres, likes to abide by the âTwo-Pizza Ruleâ - if it takes more than that to adequately feed everyone in a meeting, there are too many people at the table! Strive to keep standup groups to just relevant stakeholders in a focused topic. Organize into squads, and split meetings ruthlessly. If there are other, larger team-wide broadcasts that need to be made, consider alternate channels or meeting formats.\n\nConsider actually standing\n\nTeammates think Iâm crazy when I suggest this, because it involves an extremely awkward coordinated dance of adjusting cameras, changing desk heights, and just generally looking silly in a room alone. Strange as it seems, the physiological pressure of being in a less-than-leisurely body pose can help keep shares nice and short - direct and to the point.\n\nTake discussions offlineâ¦ ruthlessly â¦\n\nIt starts innocently enough: a status update sparks a question, and the answer is detailed and complex, which sparks a follow-up from the original speaker. Before they even realize it, the two participants have taken the meeting off the rails, and everybody elseâs eyes are slowly glazing over as they hash out the finer points. Develop a team culture for tabling those important conversations compassionately, and following up after the group has dispersed. It can feel rude to have to police this, so itâs especially important that everybody is bought in and held accountable, and understands a shared signal to move it along. Encourage followups to happen in a separate âspaceâ, so that there is a clear signal that uninterested parties are not obligated to attend.\n\nOptimize for broadband communication\n\nStanding meetings can sometimes grow large to accommodate the schedule of a single individual who has become the hub from which all others are spokes. The entire meeting degrades from n to n communication to serial bursts of 1:1 exchanges with that single person. This is often indicative of larger organizational chokepoints, and a good hint itâs time to delegate responsibility more broadly and spread the load.\n\nMake space for other group collaboration\n\nIs the daily standup the only place where group communication happens on your team? Do decisions get rushed, because they have to be made while a roomful of disinterested folks wait for their turn? Do important announcements get forgotten, buried in a laundry list of mundane updates? Make room for the longer discussions, note their importance, and encourage them to happen in a properly framed meeting venue with strictly the interested parties.\n\nDouble down on autonomy\n\nItâs common to justify a daily gathering as a way of tracking team accountability. Tickets closed, code merged, charts burnt down. Around the table, the ICs get the message that they need to justify their existence (perhaps to their manager?), and so their shares become a list of yesterdayâs accomplishments. The meetings transform into a status dump for a theoretically rapt listener than effective team communication. Think about this - in your own daily meetings, to what audience is the speaker framing their share? Do participants seem like theyâre collaborating and engaging with each other, or mostly to the manager? If your meeting culture expects every detail to be reported up the chain on a daily cadence, it can easily undermine an ICâs sense of work autonomy. It leaves the door open for unwelcome scrutiny, micro-management, and ultimately starts to wear on motivation and engagement.\n\nWhile managerial demands for daily status checks seem reasonable, they are often unnecessary, and reinforce the notion that work could deviate wildly from sprint plans at any time. I like the analogy to a cruise ship; you can make course corrections on the scale of sprint cycles, but the ship, like your devâs psyches, may be too big to turn on a dime. Escaping the notion of âstand-up as status reportâ can help managers plan more realistically, and workers feel safe in predictable work expectations. Consider incorporating automated status tracking into organization tooling, so that a developerâs normal workflow triggers updates in a board or charts visible to managers. This can help alleviate the concern that work isnât happening, even over the distances that remote teams require.\n\nIf all else fails, Slack up!\n\nA common solution to the woes of unfortunate stand-ups is to switch to an âasyncâ model, where team members leave their updates in a Slack channel or other team collaboration tool, as they come online for the day. This format alleviates a lot of the pains of having to convey status to others without making awkward time demands, so is a favorite of the meeting-averse. However, this is hardly a suitable replacement. In theory, each team member is consuming everyone elseâs updates, but in practice that rarely holds. The features that defined the format get lost - psychological pressure keeping updates brief and effective has vanished, the laundry list mentality gets exacerbated, and itâs way too easy to let the audience in the channel grow too large. This is often the last iteration of the meeting format before the whole exercise is scrapped as unhelpful.\n\nStanding together as a team\n\nWhether youâre analyzing user experience or plotting out team processes, success or failure depends greatly on how your stakeholders feel. When engineers report âfeelingâ burnout, often the first thing they call out is energy-sapping meetings - being held captive on camera while other people talk about irrelevant distractions. On the other hand, some teams will point to a daily meeting as the time they feel most like a single, sleek operating unit, and this carries through the rest of their day. A well-run standup can go a long way towards maintaining sanity in your schedule, realistic expectations of your peers, and predictable synergy on your team. Invest in doing it right.",
      "# [Rad AI Reporting](https://app.radai.com/docs/fhircast/)\nFHIRcast\n\nFHIRcast is a standard developed to provide real-time synchronization and context sharing between healthcare applications. It builds on the foundations of FHIR resources, but focuses specifically on ensuring that multiple applications remain synchronized in real-time as users interact with them.\n\nFHIRcast requires a centralized system to manage real-time synchronization and context sharing. This system is referred to as a “FHIRcast hub”.\n\nHere’s how FHIRcast works:\n\nSubscription setup: Applications subscribe to a FHIRcast hub for specific events. This is typically done during application startup.\n\nEvent triggering: When a user interacts with an application (e.g., opens a patient record or an imaging study), the application sends an event to the FHIRcast hub.\n\nReal-time notification: The FHIRcast hub immediately broadcasts this event to all subscribed applications via WebSockets, ensuring they are notified in real-time.\n\nContext synchronization: Subscribed applications receive the event notification and adjust their context accordingly. For example, if an imaging study is opened in one application, other applications might display related patient information or open the same study.\n\nA radiologist opens an imaging study in their PACS.\n\nThe PACS sends an event to the FHIRcast hub, indicating that the ImagingStudy FHIR resource has been opened.\n\nThe FHIRcast hub broadcasts this event to all subscribed applications, including the Rad AI Reporting application.\n\nThe Rad AI Reporting application receives the notification and automatically opens the same ImagingStudy, ready for the radiologist to dictate their findings into a new report.",
      "# [The Future of AI in Radiology](https://www.radai.com/webinars/the-future-of-ai-in-radiology)\nDr. Eliot Siegel, Vice Chair of Imaging Informatics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, joined Rad AI to discuss the future of AI in radiology. Dr. Sonia Gupta, AI thought leader and abdominal radiologist, moderated the discussion.\n\nDr. Gupta: Thank you to everyone who tuned into our webinar. I think it's really exciting for us to have this great turnout and shows how much engagement and excitement there is about AI in radiology.\n\nDr. Siegel began the discussion by describing where artificial intelligence will have the greatest impact in the near term.\n\nDr. Siegel: For me, the most important thing that AI can be applied to is actually the radiology report itself. So many developments in AI and natural language processing are allowing us to rethink the way we generate radiology reports and how we can do that more productively and efficiently. Thereâs incredible potential that we are not currently realizing to be able to significantly improve our efficiency and to reduce burnout as well.\n\nDr. Chang spoke about the impact Rad AI is having now in over 15% of the radiology market.\n\nDr. Chang: Rad AI Omni automatically generates the impression section of the radiology report, customized to each individual radiologist. It also handles automatic consensus guideline recommendations, helps with the automation of MIPS tracking (ensuring that the correct MIPS language is included in reports and improving billing language), reduces the need for addenda in reports, and provides error checking as well. We help radiologists by catching voice recognition typos, and other types of clinical errors in the report.Â\n\nSo this really saves radiologists time, reduces radiologist burnout, and improves the consistency and accuracy of reports. And because it gives you a little bit of a break after each complicated report, it makes people less stressed out -- it gives you a breather, so it reduces fatigue over the course of a day.Â\n\nDr. Gupta asked about how artificial intelligence can help serve as a virtual assistant for radiologists and reduce their burnout.\n\nDr. Gupta: At the same time that we have this increase in volume from the backlog of COVID-19, we also have decreasing reimbursement. And so unfortunately our survey data shows that 88% of US radiologists feel that they are at or over capacity and 25% of them say they're just unhappy being a radiologist.\n\nDr. Chang: When you're working really busy nights it's hard to always keep track of the incidental findings, always remember the different consensus guidelines and the latest recommendations, and be able to apply those appropriately at all times to create the best possible report.\n\nAnd so at Rad AI what we really tried to focus on is making sure to help the radiologist to be able to reduce the amount of cognitive load on every study so that we can automatically remember those incidental findings for you -- remember the consensus guideline recommendations to put them in automatically. That really helps alleviate some of the pressure from this high impact, non-stop imaging volume that we have on overnight shifts.Â\n\nFinally Dr. Siegel and Dr. Chang spoke about how artificial intelligence can help in closing the loop on significant incidental findings.\n\nDr. Siegel: We make so many findings, and so many recommendations, and so many suggestions for follow-up -- and yet there's not a mechanism to be able to track those.Â",

      "# [Rad AI Omni: The RANT Experience](https://www.radai.com/webinars/rad-ai-omni-the-rant-experience)\nRecently Rad AI hosted Dr. Nicholas Galante, Medical Director of Informatics at Radiology Associates of North Texas, as our special guest at our âAI in Practiceâ webinars series. Dr. Sonia Gupta, AI thought leader and abdominal radiologist, moderated the discussion.\n\nDr. Gupta: We are very excited today to have a round table to discuss RANTâs adoption of Rad AI Omni for their over 225 radiologists. Theyâre one of the largest private radiology practices in Texas and one of the largest in the nation. Dr. Galante, what was your perspective watching this deployment?Â\n\nDr. Galante: It was thankfully very smooth and very straightforward. Rad AI is an intuitive product and itâs very plug and play and very user-friendly. Basically from day one, it just comes out of the box and starts doing its thing and working alongside you. I just dove right in, and I think a lot of others dove right in as well.\n\nDr. Gupta: Well, were you skeptical that it would do what it says itâs supposed to do? Or just about AI in general?\n\nDr. Galante: Anytime you hear such great reviews, it's kind of like when you go to Yelp and you're reading restaurant reviews and it's gotten five stars over 3000 reviews. I think it puts in any kind of flaw under such a microscope because you're almost looking for it; so I was skeptical because of the reviews that were all overwhelmingly positive. But, it's scary good. I do some reports that are free form, some that are templated and just across all of this, it is incredibly good at modeling my voice. Maybe one of the best pieces of feedback I've heard is that sometimes it kind of knows your impression before you know it...I was skeptical, but it has made me a believer!Â\n\nDr. Gupta: You also mentioned in our press release that Rad AI is the first AI solution that made you appreciate the benefits of using AI in your work. Can you tell us more about that?Â\n\nDr. Galante: It's provided a tailwind and itâs giving you a boost. And again, just out of the box, it creates a palpable difference. There's the peace of mind not having to sign and then saying, âOh, I forgot to include that pulmonary nodule, now Iâve got to put an addendumâ¦â And so it's bringing down those pertinent findings that on a long complex ED report, you might have not thought to put those incidentals.Â It's got a proof checking measure, as well...if there's something in their impression that just grammatically is incorrect, chances are that it is because that's how you dictated it in the Finding section. So it's got that internal proof check as well, which I think really helps.Â\n\nDr. Gupta: Dr. Galante, could you tell us what you like the best about using Rad AI during your shifts?\n\nDr. Galante: It absolutely reduces fatigue. You're speaking less words, you're expending less energy. Also, there's the mental fatigue of just performing a repetitive task over and over again, having to synthesize your thoughts and bring those down into your impression. and also more time on images.

      "# [Battling Radiology Burnout Without Sacrificing Productivity](https://www.radai.com/blogs/battling-radiology-burnout-without-sacrificing-productivity)\nHow have radiology workloads changed in the past two decades?\n\nA recent case study of a large general hospital found that radiology RVUs rose from 6,187 in 2006 to 24,584 in 2020 (297% increase over 15 years).Â In the same time period, the number of radiology staff in the hospital remained stagnant, indicating that individual workloads increased significantly. Â The results of this study build on a prior report which noted an increase of 70.3% annual work RVUs per full-time equivalent radiologist from 1991â92 to 2006â07.Â Rapidly growing radiology workloads (defined as the product of the number and complexity of examinations performed per time unit) in the past 20 years can largely be attributed to technological developments including voice recognition software, picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), and advanced cross sectional imaging techniques.Â Another factor has been the widespread adoption of defensive medicine practices and consequent medical imaging overutilization.Â Global imaging volume is expected to double in the next eight years, so the trend of rising radiology RVU expectations will likely continue for the foreseeable future.Â Â\n\nWhat is burnout, and how does workload relate to radiologist burnout?\n\nThe Maslach Burnout Inventory is a highly established method of measuring burnout, and it considers three primary symptoms - emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low sense of personal accomplishment.Â Radiologists experiencing burnout often feel unmotivated for work and lack compassion for their patients.Â Therefore, it negatively impacts public health by adversely affecting physiciansâ clinical performance. Burnout can also contribute to absences from work, unprofessional behavior, unhealthy lifestyle habits, and premature retirement.Â Â\n\nIn 2016, the ACR Commission on Human Resources generated a list of ten risk factors for radiology burnout, which they ranked by an importance score determined by eight members on the commission.Â Reducing these factors is a shared responsibility between radiologists and health care organizations.Â Individual radiologists prevent burnout by striving to optimize their physical health, personal relationships, and pursuits outside of work.Â Seeking guidance from career coaches or mental health professionals when needed has also been shown to effectively reduce burnout rates.Â Organizations are responsible for acknowledging the problems contributing to burnout in their specific practices and encouraging open communication to cultivate a sense of collaboration and job control.Â Although social factors such as workplace isolation can be solved without modifying workloads, the two greatest factors of burnout, inadequate staffing and prolonged stress, both stem from workload expectations.Â Thus it is not surprising that increased workloads correlate with increased burnout rates.\n\nBack in 2003, an ACR study indicated that 93% of radiologists enjoyed their work.Â This was a higher level of satisfaction than most other physician specialties, but it was lower than the results of the equivalent 1995 ACR survey.Â Of the radiologists who reported low satisfaction in the study, more than half cited workload as a primary reason.Â Furthermore, radiologists who expressed dissatisfaction due to work overload felt the issue was serious enough that they were willing to accept proportionately lower income (i.e. take a 10% income cut for 10% reduction in workload).Â As with physicians overall, radiology job satisfaction has continued to decrease over time.Â Today more than 85% of US radiologists feel at or above full work capacity and approximately 70% of radiologists have experienced feelings of burnout.Â\n\nWhy hasnât AI already led to reduced radiology burnout rates?\n\nGeoffrey Hinton is a Turing Award winning computer scientist known as one of the âGodfathers of AI.âÂ Five years ago he declared, âWe should stop training radiologists now; itâs just completely obvious that within five years deep learning is going to do better than radiologists.âÂ Conversations about AI overtaking the work of radiologists have been so widespread throughout the past decade that it is now a factor for medical students moving away from radiology as their specialty choice. This discussion has only been further amplified by social media creating an inaccurate narrative around the speciality as easily replaceable with AI. However, current studies concede that previous speculations were overly optimistic and did not accurately consider regulatory processes and scarcity of training data.Â Â\n\nSince 2016, The FDA has approved 80+ AI algorithms for medical imaging, and ~30% of radiologists have adopted some form of AI into their practice.Â Most of these AI solutions have not lived up to the expectation of reducing the burden on radiologists.Â A group of Dutch researchers recently studied a random sample of 440 medical imaging studies published in 2019.Â They found that rather than being integrated into existing workflows and taking over tasks for radiologists, AI applications generally led to additional post-processing and interpretation time.Â As a result, 86% of AI-focused studies were actually associated with a higher workload for radiologists.Â Â\n\nHow is Rad AI Omni increasing efficiency and reducing burnout rates?\n\nRad AI Omni uses artificial intelligence to generate report impressions from dictated findings.Â Without adding a single click into existing workflows, Omni creates impressions which are customized to each radiologistâs language preferences in less than a couple seconds.Â Radiologists using Rad AI achieve time savings of an hour a day, allowing them to heighten their focus on the most specialized aspects of their work - expert imaging interpretation and diagnosis.Â Taking another look at the ACRâs list of risk factors for radiology burnout, the primary factor identified is inadequate staffing.Â Hiring more radiologists decreases workload by reducing the necessary productivity levels of each radiologist in the practice.Â Rad AI Omni instead minimizes the tedium and time required to read each study, thereby reducing workloads while maintaining or improving individual levels of productivity.Â Â",
      "# [Rad AI: Radiology Workflow-Focused AI](https://www.radai.com/blogs/rad-ai-radiology-workflow-focused-ai)\nThe lack of widespread adoption is multifactorial, explained in part by the cost and lack of reimbursement. The types of available algorithms likely also play a role in the lack of adoption. The majority of commercially available AI algorithms are imaging-focused, emphasizing triage of acute findings and providing a âsecond set of eyes.â Non-image interpretation AI solutions (scheduling, billing, workflow optimization, etc.) are less widely available.\n\nMy radiology group, Inland Imaging, is a private practice group in the Pacific Northwest consisting of over 100 radiologists, the vast majority of which are subspecialized. Despite evaluating numerous algorithms, we have not found an imaging-focused AI solution that âmoved the needleâ for our group. However, non-image interpretation AI solutions have the potential to make a meaningful impact, particularly solutions that streamline workflow and/or improve radiologist productivity.Â\n\nRad AI is an AI vendor whose primary product, Rad AI Omni, automatically generates the impression of radiology reports based on the findings. The algorithm is trained using thousands of reports for each individual radiologist and does surprisingly well mimicking the diction of the interpreting radiologist.Â\n\nDuring Inlandâs initial use of Rad AI, it quickly became apparent that Rad AI Omni provided a significant time savings in the generation of the report impression, which translates to an opportunity for increased radiologist productivity. In addition to the time savings, the solicited radiologist feedback demonstrated that Rad AI Omni helped to reduce fatigue and the feeling of burnout by automating some of the monotonous and repetitive portions of dictated reports.Â\n\nAs a neuroradiologist, one example of Rad AI Omni eliminating a repetitive and monotonous task is in the impression generation on cross sectional degenerative spine reports. Radiologists often have a standardized format and style for these reports, which suits Rad AI Omni perfectly. While the impressions on these reports can be quite long, Rad AI Omni quickly and reliably synthesizes the impression using the same diction as the interpreting radiologist. This allows the radiologist time for a âlast lookâ at the images. A normal workday may contain a dozen or more such reports. Different radiology subspecialties have similar examples of repetitive exams. Rad AI Omni excels in reducing the burden of these repetitive dictations, which reduces fatigue and leaves the radiologist feeling less drained at the end of the day.Â\n\nAnother product offered by Rad AI, called Rad AI Continuity, identifies and categorizes follow-up recommendations and confirms appropriateness and adherence to society guidelines. It then automates the communication of the recommendation to the patient and outpatient provider. Finally, it tracks adherence to follow-up recommendations and ensures that the loop is closed. Rad AI is constantly updating the Continuity program by adding tracking of new standardized follow-up recommendations. This automation and tracking results in increased compliance with clinically appropriate follow-up recommendations, improving quality and adding value to the radiologist work product.Â",

      "# [How Generative AI Will Redefine Radiology Reporting](https://www.radai.com/webinars/how-generative-ai-will-redefine-radiology-reporting)\nIn this webinar, Dr. Woojin Kim, Dr. William Boonn, Dr. Mindy Yang, and Dr. Elizabeth Hawk discussed a wide range of topics related to the application of generative AI in healthcare and zoomed in on GenAI in radiology reporting.\n\nThe discussion touches on GenAIâs potential to automate administrative tasks, thereby allowing healthcare professionals to focus more on tasks that require higher level thinking and clinical decision-making.

      "# [AI in Healthcare: Bridging Ideas to Implementation](https://www.radai.com/blogs/ai-in-healthcare-bridging-ideas-to-implementation)\nThe journey of machine learning, from its nascent stages in the 1940s with the likes of Alan Turing pondering the possibilities of machines thinking, has been nothing short of revolutionary. However, technological integration into the healthcare sector has not been without its pitfallsâfor instance, the cumbersome electronic health record (EHR) systems. This post aims to provide general advice on navigating the complex landscape of developing AI applications in healthcare, offering insights for achieving seamless integration and impactful outcomes. Depending on your project, the specifics will vary greatly, but following some or all of the below will make for much smoother sailing.\n\nIdentifying the problem and having a clear end result.\n\nThe first step in creating a meaningful application is identifying a concrete problem. This might seem straightforward, but it's where many teams need to improve. The importance of this foundational step cannot be overstated. Â Successful ML applications are not just about leveraging advanced algorithms or having access to vast datasets; it's about applying these tools to solve a specific, well-defined problem that has real-world implications for patients and providers.\n\nA practical example of this concept is Rad AI Omni Impressions, a tool designed to assist radiologists by generating high-precision summaries of their reports known as âImpressionsâ. The creation of these âImpressionsâ is normally repetitive and time consuming for radiologists. Impressions specifically aims to alleviate the burden during this phase of the workflow, focusing on tangible goals such as reducing fatigue and enhancing efficiency.\n\nSimilarly, while ML has tremendous transformative potential, it is worth cautioning against the allure of technology for technology's sake (Topol, 2020). The key is not just to innovate but to innovate with purpose and, as discussed later, with a strong proposed Return on Investment (ROI) over the status quo. The development of ML applications must be driven by a clear understanding of the challenges they aim to address and the tangible benefits they seek to deliver.\n\nThe process of problem identification involves not only understanding the clinical need but also engaging with stakeholders, including healthcare professionals, patients, and policymakers. This engagement ensures that the ML solution is not only technologically advanced but also practical, usable, and aligned with the needs of those it aims to serve. Furthermore, setting clear, achievable goals is essential. These goals should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART), providing a roadmap for the project's development and implementation.\n\nA real-world example of this approach can be seen in the development of ML applications for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy. The problem is clear and well-defined: early detection of this condition can prevent severe visual impairment. The goal, therefore, is to develop a tool that can accurately and efficiently screen patients for early signs of diabetic retinopathy, facilitating timely intervention. This example underscores the importance of beginning with a concrete problem and having a clear end result in mind.\n\nEnsuring data represents real-world situations.\n\nData is undoubtedly the lifeblood of any AI application, but it's a whole different ball game when it comes to healthcare. Here, sheer volume of data isn't the only game in town. It's the diversity and quality of that data that truly makes a difference, ensuring it accurately reflects the myriad complexities and nuances of real-world medical scenarios.\n\nFor LLMs and other contemporary model architectures to truly excel, they need more than just a large amount of data. They need the correct data. Just like in any educational setting where the quality of materials determines the quality of learning, LLMs require high-quality, well-curated data to thrive. This isn't just about feeding them information; it's about educating them with data that's as close to the real deal as possible.\n\nDrawing from the insights provided in the paper \"Exploring the Impact of Data Quality on Large Language Models\" (arXiv:2306.11644) it becomes evident that the 'nutrition' we provide to these AI models through data significantly impacts their performance across the board. The paper eloquently discusses how nuanced, high-quality datasets serve as the optimal nourishment that enables LLMs, particularly in the healthcare domain, to achieve better performance. It's akin to the difference between fast food and a balanced diet for humans; the quality of the input directly affects the output.\n\nIn practice, this involves using targeted datasets created in real-world workflows, and applying domain knowledge to highlight the most meaningful parts of this data. At Rad AI, we have access to hundreds of millions of radiology reports. However, effectively utilizing them is more complex than simply feeding them into a model training pipeline. To focus the data in a way that reflects what you want your model to learn, you must first understand the data you're starting with.\n\nImagine teaching a medical student with outdated textbooks and then expecting them to perform complex surgeries. The outcome likely wouldn't be great. The same goes for models. If we're aiming for AI applications that not only support but enhance healthcare delivery, we must prioritize the impeccable quality and variety of data we provide. This ensures that these models can handle the complexities of healthcare, offering data-efficient approaches that significantly surpass their predecessors.\n\nHave an ROI pitch.\n\nThe theoretical promise of AI in healthcare is potentially enormous. However, the tangible results are often elusive. This is one of many reasons why ROI is a core component of anything worth building. To be clear, we are not advocating ROI in purely financial terms. In fact, the best clinical-facing offerings tend to start with non-financial ROI and then supply financial benefits as an additional consideration.\n\nIt is crucial that you not only have a solid idea of your ROI proposition but also work on how you will communicate this to the stakeholders in the healthcare institutions you will need to work with. It will not matter if your model is 99% accurate if you cannot or do not convey how this moves the needle in practical terms.\n\nFor instance, when we converse with medical providers and administrators, we don't discuss vague outcomes or intangible benefits, even though these areas hold considerable potential. Instead, we focus on concrete results. For Omni Impressions, we highlight quantifiable reductions in fatigue and increased accuracy in reporting. For Rad AI Continuity, we emphasize measurable patient follow-up rates and real-world patient outcome statistics where Continuity played a key role.\n\nDeveloping ML models for healthcare is a multifaceted endeavor that goes beyond technical achievement and requires a highly multidisciplinary team. Your ROI pitch should be grounded in tangible benefits like improved patient outcomes, operational efficiency, and financial savings. Further, the more you are able to tie this to quantifiable outcomes and existing industry KPIs, the more straightforward your conversations will be. A significant caveat to this, though, is that you should not feel limited to these metrics; there are, of course, a multitude of benefits that will be just as, if not more, impactful but difficult to quantify.\n\nBuild with innovation partners.\n\nOnce you are at the point of having end users engage with some version of your product, you want to start looking for and building with individuals and teams that are not just end users of your product but are willing to innovate alongside your team. The part that makes all the difference in the world here is engagementâthe vision of the potential benefits of what your project could be and not necessarily what it currently is.\n\nThe building of these applications tends to be a very iterative process. Therefore, you will want people who will not only have some patience for the inevitable pitfalls as biases and edge cases are worked through. The trade of here is you are asking for additional help from your end users who can not only point out things you have not thought of but also provide ample amounts of constructive feedback to help hammer your product from a dented piece of metal to a smooth and shiny offering that provides many more upside benefits than the original prototype.\n\nThis process is exemplified by several radiology groups that have been partners of Rad AI for a long time, some since the company's earliest days. The radiologists we collaborate with not only act as end users but also help us tailor our tools to be as effective and purposeful as possible. We actively engage with our users and value their feedback, striving to make the development process beneficial for both parties.\n\nWhile this refinement process can occur without such engagement, and you should only offload some of the debugging process onto your end users, a more collaborative approach in the iterative process can accelerate progress on core issues and result in a superior end product.\n\nTest and monitor thoroughly.\n\nThorough testing and validation are non-negotiable. This process begins with offline validation and should ideally include human validation to assess the application's real-world efficacy. The advent of generative AI (GenAI) introduces the need for innovative performance monitoring metrics, necessitating creative approaches to assessment.\n\nIn our deployments, we utilize a wide range of both offline and online metrics to maintain quality and consistency. Besides traditional text-based metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, we've also implemented our own custom metrics. These focus on the content and meaning of the text generated by our models, rather than just token-level accuracy. Creating custom metrics is a domain-specific and time-consuming process, but it can be a worthwhile investment. This is especially true for generative models, where more traditional metrics may fall short.\n\nDeployment is just the beginning. The real test comes when the application faces production data. Monitoring performance necessitates a blend of qualitative feedback and quantitative metrics, focusing on the solutionâs performance and the synergy between the AI and its human users. Adjusting to feedback and data drift is an ongoing process essential for the application's evolution.\n\nEmbrace Human-in-the-Loop systems.\n\nWhile the allure of full automation is strong, the reality of healthcare demands a much more grounded approach. Human-in-the-loop systems represent a balanced integration of AI and human expertise, capitalizing on the strengths of each. These systems have proven to be the most effective in scenarios requiring complex reasoning or nuanced judgment. From both ethical and practical considerations, clinicians are still ultimately responsible for how they choose to use AI-powered tools. As powerful as they are becoming, these new features are still just that: tools. These systems should be looked at as additional tools used as input to the overall decision-making process, not something that is meant to supplant it.\n\nWe've deployed numerous ML driven applications and features. However, most still incorporate human input within the workflow. Despite their capabilities, modern language models aren't yet ready to operate independently. For instance, in Omni Imressions, a radiologist still reviews and signs off on the impression. In Continuity, a medical professional ensures the validity of patient follow-ups. While some argue that this approach limits the potential of ML augmented workflows, the success of Rad AI and many others in the industry proves otherwise. These ML-augmented workflows continue to offer significant benefits relative to baseline.\n\nExpanding on this, we also establish systems that interpret human interaction with our model outputs, which can then be used as direct human feedback. Beyond just analytics, this approach enables you to feed production data back into your models. This allows for ongoing improvement, ensures data remains current, and minimizes issues with data drift and models becoming outdated.\n\nThere are many additional considerations such as appropriate transparency on limitations, training on how to use, and the potential limitations that should also be considerations in the deployment of AI-powered technologies both in and outside of the healthcare domain.\n\nThe responsibility for appropriate and responsible implementation of these powerful tools does not rest on any one party, as with so many other areas of society. This burden is a shared commodity. The people involved at all stages of the process, ranging from developers, clinicians, regulators, and, in some instances, the patients, should all be vigilant to how these autonomous systems are changing how we approach healthcare (Herrington, 2023).\n\nConclusion\n\nReturning to the example of a screening solution for diabetic retinopathy, the solution needs to be introduced at the right steps in the patient journey (at times where retinal images are being acquired, or being made available in retrospect). Deployment and training needs to be done with specific clinical stakeholders (potentially optometrists, ophthalmic technicians, nurses, primary care physicians or Physician Assistants (PAs), depending on the complexity of product training and use, and the route of introduction into the clinical workflow). Product and data security and privacy need to be ensured, alongside any necessary clearances for that specific geographic market.\n\nThe production data used for the screening solution needs to be readily available in a consistent format effectively represented by the ML modelsâ training data, or acquired specifically for the purpose of screening. Clinical stakeholders and executive leadership at optometry offices, primary care offices and/or health systems need to buy into the necessity and benefit of adoptionâand will likely need to see specific measurable ROI beyond the improvements to patient care.\n\nIncorporating artificial intelligence into the healthcare sector comes with its set of difficulties, but it also offers significant opportunities for important changes. While developers must overcome these hurdles, which might involve acquiring new knowledge and adopting novel approaches, successful outcomes generally justify the additional effort involved.\n\nâ",

So while working all these nights, I started thinking about how we could streamline radiology workflow. How do we use AI to make a really positive impact on our field?Â\n\nDr. Chang explained why applying artificial intelligence to reporting workflow is incredibly beneficial to radiologists.\n\nDr. Chang: As radiologists, we spend more than 70% of our time dictating reports, almost non-stop using voice recognition software -- it's what leads to our burnout and our exhaustion.

We're increasingly trying to raise the visibility of our practice amongst the broader health community.Â\n\nDr. Poff talked about the impact of using Rad AI and how it feels to use it on a daily basis.\n\nDr. Poff: I've been using this everyday, every shift, 100% of the time now for two to three months -- and it's getting to the point where I would have a hard time not using it. It feels like having a virtual assistant on my team. Particularly on a call shift, you have voice fatigue and you're dehydrated -- and, I have very much noticed that now that I use Rad AI , I'm fresher by the end of my shift.\n\nHe also shared Rad AI's impact in reducing errors.\n\nDr. Poff: Rad AI is going to maximize your chances of getting all those important incidental findings into your impressions. We're all human, it's easy to occasionally forget to put those in.Â\n\nFinally Dr. Poff shared his perspective on being at the forefront of adopting innovative technology.",
      "# [How AI Can Help Radiology Groups Address Reimbursement Changes](https://www.radai.com/blogs/how-ai-can-help-radiology-groups-address-reimbursement-changes)\nRBMA, ACR and other groups are actively lobbying Congress to mitigate the impact of these changes, but with bipartisan focus on this issue after years of pushing off significant changes, it is hard to see how some sort of reform will not be enacted. In the near term, lobbying efforts will hopefully prevail, but these are likely to only delay ongoing reimbursement pressures at best. With healthcare spend at roughly 17% of GDP, every player in healthcare will have to accept lower reimbursements over time.\n\nWith this in mind, radiology groups will be forced to seek innovative solutions to maintain current levels of revenue, or, dare we say it, to grow.Â If groups are unable to maintain revenue, they will need to cut costs.Â Radiologist salaries typically compose 70-90% of practice costs, with IT, billing, and G&A costs making up the balance. Some cost efficiencies can potentially be gained here, but aside from cutting personnel or lowering salaries, most adjustments will not be significant enough to offset an 11% reduction in reimbursements.\n\nInstead, increasing productivity becomes the most viable strategy.Â However, radiologists are already quite efficient, and rather overworked. Study volume is often so high that fatigue and burnout are very common concerns amongst radiology practices. According to research from Mayo Clinic, radiologists already need to review one image every 3 to 4 seconds to meet workload demands, and per recent survey data, 88.4% of US radiologists are at or over capacity, feeling overworked and overextended. This leaves radiology groups in a difficult position - how can they simultaneously increase radiologist productivity, while also helping radiologists avoid burnout? The answer lies in the bellwether that consistently impacts our field before most others: advances in technology.\n\nAs a profession, weâve been at the forefront of adopting new technology to refine our workflow: PACS, voice recognition, smart worklists, etc. By streamlining our workflow, we offload more of the repetitive activities that tax our time and attention, freeing up our ability to focus on expert image interpretation and diagnosis. Fortunately for us, the latest technology - artificial intelligence - is maturing at just the right time to allow us to automate more tedious aspects of our workflow in ways that werenât previously possible.\n\nWhen the public thinks of AI in the context of radiology, they tend to imagine algorithms analyzing imaging studies from beginning to end, and somehow replacing radiologists. AI is a number of years away from having a practical end-to-end impact on image analysis and diagnosis in real world clinical practice, due to a wide range of technical and market challenges. But even when it does mature to this stage, AI will augment what radiologists do, not replace them. Just as other professions, such as law, financial planning, and accounting are seeing some repetitive tasks performed by smart machines, radiologists will find AI gradually enhancing their current roles.\n\nThere are a few imaging applications of AI that are already proving useful for very specific needs; for example, some pulmonary nodule detection algorithms are improving accuracy in new lung cancer diagnosis.Â Other imaging applications work outside the radiologistâs workflow; one promising app was recently granted a Medicare New Technology Add-on Payment for improving stroke care, by shortening the turnaround time on stroke screening for neurologists and neurosurgeons.Â This often bypasses the radiologist altogether, though it can be very useful for stroke centers.\n\nFor radiology groups, what matters much more is how we can improve radiology workflow right now with AI. For example, there are a number of AI solutions that focus on triage or worklist prioritization through identification of critical imaging findings. Other AI solutions focus on simplifying parts of the workflow before image interpretation, such as image acquisition, streamlining access to relevant patient history, or aiding in report generation. In fact, the ACR has a fantastic list for the many diverse use cases of AI in streamlining radiology workflows. Â\n\nOne such AI product my company has built reads the Findings section of a radiologistâs report as it is being dictated and composes a customized Impression section using the individual radiologistâs dictation style, that can then be edited and signed off. In addition, it pulls in all significant findings, highlights pertinent negatives, and answers the main clinical question. In doing this, it helps reduce radiologistsâ mental fatigue, increases efficiency, and improves accuracy.\n\nAs new products are developed, an important factor in AI success is ease of deployment. For example, AI products should ideally integrate seamlessly with radiologistsâ preferred PACS, voice recognition, worklist and RIS, and operate without any additional clicks, hotkeys, or new windows. After all, if the central aim of incorporating AI into the workflow is to increase productivity while also curbing burnout, it is of no use if itâs not readily adopted by radiologists. A solution that does not require heavy change management and ongoing training is much preferred for radiologist adoption.Â\n\nThe practice of radiology has long been at the forefront of technological innovation, but we havenât seen as much in the way of major advances since the advent of PACS and voice recognition. Artificial intelligence is the next step in a long line of new technologies that have been championed by innovative radiologists, and especially when it comes to improving radiology workflow, itâs a technology we can start applying now. The most savvy radiology groups are already doing this, but more of us can easily adopt this technology to address the challenges of looming reimbursement cuts without overtaxing radiologists."

While the typical start-up culture of sexual harassment does not exist (truly a wonderful job of that), there are many, many micro-aggressions against women. Also, some \"favorite\" mid-level leaders treat other teammates terribly. Intentionally set them up for failure, stab them in the back, and stop at nothing to elevate themselves - and that behavior is rewarded. This is going to breed a toxic, toxic culture if not quickly addressed.",

Knowing the heart of many people - I really tried to dismiss this. It quickly became clear that the expectation was for women to do the women's work. Heavy lifting before, during, and after events would be left to only female team members. Leadership would come halfway through the event, not acknowledge them, and leave before the event was over, often in dangerous cities or situations without offering to help. It's been elevated to the point that other companies noticed and offered to stay behind to ensure they had the necessary help. Leaders often complained about spending time with team members and repeatedly said they didn't like team-building activities, conferences, etc. Often, ideas and projects from the only female team member are claimed by other team members. Female team members are cut off in meetings, and important initiatives are not supported by leadership that is assigned to female team members. I would also caution you to provide feedback in the weekly employee surveys. Shortly after, a few began sharing their dissatisfaction; it was brought up in team meetings about \"negativity,\" and they were let go shortly after. A few \"favorites\" play games - what they say in private slack messages and publically are wildly different and borderline harassing. They will be publically praised in all team meetings while their abusive behavior towards other teammates is ignored. I truly don't think they are aware of the microaggressions (and likely could be addressed). Still, a few people on the team do the most outwardly blatantly toxic behaviors privately, and senior leadership is likely unaware. But because those individuals are constantly being praised \"as the only people on the team doing things correctly\" it isn't possible to bring up concerns.",

All meetings are recorded as the leadership cannot trust their employees to do work. It is amazing how much time people spend playing politics when there is not even a working product nor a market fit yet.\r\n\r\nAnimosity between cofounders as the CFO has taken over as CEO. While they claim that the company was built by radiologists for radiologists, the radiologist / ex-CEO has no power, always working alone at a corner of the office away from other employees. \"Automate radiologists' paycheck\" is the true culture of the company. Condescending memes about radiologists are posted publicly. The ML team is heavily inflated with a lot of ego. Be prepared to make avocado toasts for your manager. Their AI does not work and they cover up their flaws by not having tests, blotching usage stat, and blaming the radiologists for not being \"consistent\".\r\n\r\nThe current CEO has assembled an executive team of yes-people who are willing to play his game and support him no matter what. While they have no real autonomy, they are rewarded with promotions beyond their experience or competence. If you dare to disagree with him, you'd be ushered out of the back door. The day when shelter-in-place was in order, he was enraged and said \"Why don't we let the people who is going to die, die, instead of ruining the economy?!\" Employees who criticized his handling of COVID were layoff a week later due to \"performance issues\".\r\n\r\nXenophobic and sexist comments get toasted around regularly. I have never worked at a place less inclusive than Rad AI.",

All meetings are recorded as the leadership cannot trust their employees to do work. It is amazing how much time people spend playing politics when there is not even a working product nor a market fit yet.\r\n\r\nAnimosity between cofounders as the CFO has taken over as CEO. While they claim that the company was built by radiologists for radiologists, the radiologist / ex-CEO has no power, always working alone at a corner of the office away from other employees. \"Automate radiologists' paycheck\" is the true culture of the company. Condescending memes about radiologists are posted publicly. The ML team is heavily inflated with a lot of ego. Be prepared to make avocado toasts for your manager. Their AI does not work and they cover up their flaws by not having tests, blotching usage stat, and blaming the radiologists for not being \"consistent\".\r\n\r\nThe current CEO has assembled an executive team of yes-people who are willing to play his game and support him no matter what. While they have no real autonomy, they are rewarded with promotions beyond their experience or competence. If you dare to disagree with him, you'd be ushered out of the back door. The day when shelter-in-place was in order, he was enraged and said \"Why don't we let the people who is going to die, die, instead of ruining the economy?!\" Employees who criticized his handling of COVID were layoff a week later due to \"performance issues\".\r\n\r\nXenophobic and sexist comments get toasted around regularly.

While the typical start-up culture of sexual harassment does not exist (truly a wonderful job of that), there are many, many micro-aggressions against women. Also, some \"favorite\" mid-level leaders treat other teammates terribly. Intentionally set them up for failure, stab them in the back, and stop at nothing to elevate themselves - and that behavior is rewarded. This is going to breed a toxic, toxic culture if not quickly addressed.",
        "cons": "Everything started great - until I realized the lack of women in leadership positions. (Take a look at the website). Knowing the heart of many people - I really tried to dismiss this. It quickly became clear that the expectation was for women to do the women's work. Heavy lifting before, during, and after events would be left to only female team members. Leadership would come halfway through the event, not acknowledge them, and leave before the event was over, often in dangerous cities or situations without offering to help. It's been elevated to the point that other companies noticed and offered to stay behind to ensure they had the necessary help. Leaders often complained about spending time with team members and repeatedly said they didn't like team-building activities, conferences, etc. Often, ideas and projects from the only female team member are claimed by other team members. Female team members are cut off in meetings, and important initiatives are not supported by leadership that is assigned to female team members. I would also caution you to provide feedback in the weekly employee surveys. Shortly after, a few began sharing their dissatisfaction; it was brought up in team meetings about \"negativity,\" and they were let go shortly after. A few \"favorites\" play games - what they say in private slack messages and publically are wildly different and borderline harassing. They will be publically praised in all team meetings while their abusive behavior towards other teammates is ignored. I truly don't think they are aware of the microaggressions (and likely could be addressed). Still, a few people on the team do the most outwardly blatantly toxic behaviors privately, and senior leadership is likely unaware. But because those individuals are constantly being praised \"as the only people on the team doing things correctly\" it isn't possible to bring up concerns.",

      "# [Save Time and Decrease Burnout with Radiology AI Software](https://www.radai.com/)\nRad AI Continuity is the most comprehensive follow-up management platform on the market, tracking more than 50 categories of incidental findings and significantly increasing patient follow-up rates. Weâre very excited about this collaboration as it will allow us to have improved visibility and provide a safety net over our entire patient population to ensure our patients feel informed and empowered.\n\nWith Continuity, we have a 100% radiology safety net. Every single radiology report that comes in with an incidental finding has been communicated to the appropriate stakeholders. We're tracking whether or not those follow-ups happen within the appropriate, recommended timeframe mitigating all our liability to ensure that we keep patients in our network.\n\nThe amazing thing about Rad AI Reporting is that you're able to achieve exponential efficiency gains, but with less perceived effort. It doesn't benefit you if you're going faster but you know you're going fast because you're more fatigued. The idea is to smooth things out in a way where you're almost in a flow state, and Rad AI Reporting does that.\n\nHaving greatly benefited from using Rad AI Impressions, we are thrilled to add Continuity to our current partnership with the team at Rad AI. The management of incidental findings in radiology reports is a key focus for our group as itâs incredibly beneficial for the patients we serve. After evaluating every vendor in this space, we found that Continuity provides the most automated and most comprehensive solution in follow-up management.\n\nIt gives you the ability to generate a complete report in the interpreting radiologist's own language, whether you use structured reporting or dictate freely, just by dictating the pertinent findings. This saves an enormous amount of wasted energy in having to create full sentences.\n\nRad AI Impressions is what we have all been waiting for! Providing much-needed efficiency gains in my daily workflow life is sometimes absolutely surreal! It is like I have my own trainee who perfectly excels at impressions.\n\nUsing Rad AI Impressions to auto-generate my impressions has been wonderful. Iâve gotten to use it on overnight shifts, and itâs a game changer. It really helps with breezing through case volume with less fatigue.\n\nWhile hard to measure in minutes or seconds or even dollars, one huge value is the \"coffee sip\" factor. Before Rad AI Impressions, I was talking all the time and my cup of coffee in the morning would inevitably get cold. With Rad AI impressions, I get just long enough of a break to take a sip of warm coffee. And each time I sip my warm coffee, I smile.\n\nRad AI exceeded radiologist expectations out of the gate. Seamless integration permitted our radiologists to immediately realize the efficiencies of the Rad AI Impressions platform. With Rad AI, our radiologists reported feeling less stressed with more time available to review studies or tend to other tasks. This is exactly the type of IT solution needed to help reduce radiologistsâ burnout and boost job satisfaction.\n\nHaving greatly benefited from using Rad AI Impressions, we are thrilled to add Continuity to our current partnership with the team at Rad AI. The management of incidental findings in radiology reports is a key focus for our group as itâs incredibly beneficial for the patients we serve. After evaluating every vendor in this space, we found that Continuity provides the most automated and most comprehensive solution in follow-up management.\n\nWe have seen how critical it is to close the loop on significant incidental findings and what a challenging problem it is to address using our currently available resources. By automating the majority of steps related to patient follow-ups, Rad AI removes those manual tasks from our clinical team and gives them back more time to focus on caring for their patients.\n\nWhen we recently discussed our expansions and renewals for AI solutions, we saw Rad AI as a must-have. If we were to rank our solutions, it's at the top. With a high volume of high acuity cases, Rad AI Impressions helps us manage our caseload. The performance continues to improve -- in 90 to 95% of the impressions that it generates, I don't have to edit anything, and the consensus guideline recommendations are working really well.\n\nWe are committed to the patients and healthcare entities we serve, and we believe that partnering with Rad AI will improve the efficiency of our radiologists and increase the value associated with our services. We look forward to using Rad AI Impressions' automated impression technology to make our radiologists more effective and to help decrease burnout.\n\nRad AI Impressions will assist our radiologists in providing the highest-quality reports, while greatly reducing the rework that is built into the process. Weâre excited to partner with Rad AI, as the feedback weâve received from other Strategic Radiology members nationally has been overwhelmingly positive, and weâre looking forward to the same experience at our practice.\n\nWeâve been incredibly pleased with the partnership that has developed with Rad AI. As a CIO, your aim is to make investments in technology that make a tangible difference throughout the practice. Once the Rad AI Impressions rollout began, the benefits spread 'word of mouth' style like a brushfire. The radiologists became the largest supporters of the product â touting the efficiency, quality and overall reduction in fatigue improvements amongst themselves. Expansion of the agreement was a no-brainer. I would strongly encourage any radiology practice CIO seeking an impactful AI investment to prioritize a relationship with Rad AI.\n\nEven though Rad AI has an incredible reputation in the radiology community, we were hesitant to try AI in our practice and wanted to prove it out for ourselves. After using Rad AI Impressions with a small initial set of users, we are so glad we did as we saw an immediate impact. We are now rapidly expanding to the rest of the radiologists in our practice.\n\nAfter thoroughly evaluating numerous radiology AI solutions via our collaborative we believe Rad AI Impressions will provide the most impactful value proposition for our member groups. Rad AI impressions' automated impression generator extracted from the radiologistâs dictated findings not only results in enhanced report quality and efficiency, but also helps alleviate fatigue by the end of a shift.\n\nI knew from the first time I used Rad AI Impressions it would be a complete game-changer by allowing us to turn around the highest-quality reports faster with fewer addenda. Of all the technology and solutions that weâve implemented for our practice, Rad AI Impressions has made the biggest impact on our efficiency and quality. I have personally reached out to colleagues of mine to prioritize a partnership with Rad AI.\n\nOur practice has been on the forefront of innovation in radiology, building on our heritage of leading the way with transformative technologies that ultimately prove to become the gold standard for radiology practices. We believe our partnership with Rad AI will enable us to maintain this type of technological leadership, and Rad AI Impressions will be a powerfully assistive tool for our radiologists.\n\nWe expanded our partnership with Rad AI to every radiologist not just because of the benefits our radiologists experienced, but also because the Rad AI team is incredible to work with. They truly listen and prioritize our feedback.\n\nOur initial group of radiologist users were very impressed by Rad AIâs ability to reduce fatigue and improve productivity using artificial intelligence, while improving the quality of patient care. We evaluate many AI vendors, and Rad AI proved to not only be a valuable solution our radiologists wanted to use, but theyâve also been a fantastic partner in helping us fully leverage the power of AI to do more for our patients.\n\nItâs important to Inland Imaging to remain at the forefront of implementing groundbreaking technology to best serve our patients and provide the optimal environment for our radiologists to do their best work. Our radiologists are impressed with the efficiency gains, quality gains, and reduction in fatigue. Rad AI is an ideal partner that is both innovative and customer-focused, and places a premium on developing long-term partnerships.\n\nRad AI has made a big difference in my daily productivity and endurance throughout my day. I am now less mentally fatigued towards the end of my day because I do not have the added mental strain of summarizing my findings in the impression. The program does it for me. I also find myself catching more voice recognition errors when I read over the generated impression which allows me to go back and fix these errors in the body of the reportâ¦ an added bonus!",
      "# [LucidHealth and Rad AI Finalize Partnership Agreement for AI Radiology Solution by Andrea Moran on 2024-06-18](https://blog.lucidhealth.com/lucidhealth-and-rad-ai-finalize-partnership-agreement-for-ai-radiology-solution)\nPartnership provides LucidHealth radiologists with access to Rad AI Omni Impressions, the only AI solution to improve radiology report dictation and accelerate interpretations\n\nColumbus, OH -- LucidHealth, a national leader in radiology services employing over 300 physicians, and Rad AI, the nation’s fastest-growing radiologist-led AI company, have finalized an agreement to provide LucidHealth radiology practices with access to Rad AI Omni Impressions.\n\nThe solution's deployment began with Radiology Associates of the Fox Valley in Neenah, WI, the first practice to utilize the tool earlier this year. Three more LucidHealth practices in the state of Wisconsin are intended to follow, in addition to practices spanning Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Ohio, and Nevada. LucidHealth's teleradiology service, LucidSolutionsTM, will also incorporate Rad AI Omni Impressions for more than 70 remote-based providers.\n\n“After hearing positive feedback of Omni Impressions from other radiologists and practices, we decided to pilot the solution amongst our team of physicians,” said Marc Miller, MD, president of Radiology Associates of the Fox Valley. “We're excited to move into the future with leading generative AI capabilities that Rad AI Omni offers. It has already proven to help reduce burnout and improve the efficiency of reporting - a win for both our radiologists and for patient care.”\n\nRad AI Omni Impressions automatically generates a customized radiology report impression from the findings and clinical indication dictated by the radiologist, using the most advanced neural networks. It learns each radiologist’s language and style preferences from their prior reports to create an impression that the radiologist can simply review and finalize.\n\nIn addition, Rad AI improves report accuracy and consistency by automatically including significant incidental findings, answering the main clinical question, and providing the latest consensus guideline recommendations for follow-up. The impression appears in the practice's voice recognition software as soon as the radiologist finishes dictating the findings, without any clicks, hotkeys, or new windows.\n\n“We believe the future of radiology is empowered, connected, and networked. Our goal is to provide our physicians with the resources they need so they have the time to do what they do best - and that's care for patients,\" said Tom Hasley, Chief Information Officer for LucidHealth. \"During the pilot with Radiology Associates of Fox Valley, our team found Omni Impressions gave us the ability to enhance report quality and efficiency while also helping alleviate fatigue during each shift.\"\n\n“We couldn’t be more thrilled about our partnership with this innovative team,” said Josh Duncan, VP of Sales and Customer Success at Rad AI. “We are hearing from radiologists across the country who greatly appreciate the reduction in fatigue they experience when using Rad AI Omni Impressions. As it’s becoming increasingly more challenging to recruit radiologists, practices are embracing Rad AI Omni not just for efficiency and quality benefits but also as a way to attract and retain talented radiologists.

The company has numerous offerings and is perhaps most well-known for its Reporting and Omni Impressions platforms, both of which have been developed as a means to augment clinician productivity. For example, Rad AI Omni Impressions automatically generates report impressions once the raw findings have been dictated by the radiologist. The key differentiator of this technology is that the platform continuously learns from each user and generates a personalized output that is in the stylistic tone and literary voice of each individual radiologist.\n\nThe company’s partnership with Google Cloud will provide an opportunity to scale its technology by leveraging Google’s platform, MedLM foundation models and its cloud services. MedLM, a family of foundation models fine-tuned for healthcare applications, will especially help unlock a significant amount of potential for the company by increasing the accuracy of reports, improving stylistic customizations and contributing to workflow optimization.\n\nThough Rad AI is relatively young, it has seen significant investment and interest; its Series A funding round alone involved nearly $25 million, and the company is now working with nearly 30% of the radiology services market in the United States.\n\nDoktor Gurson, Co-founder and CEO of Rad AI, enthusiastically explains that the company has been built by radiologists for radiologists with a few ambitious goals: reduce radiologist burnout, improve clinical workflows and ultimately, make a positive impact on clinical care delivery. He also explains that the partnership with Google Cloud is an important step forward for the company in its growth journey: “Rad AI brings the domain expertise in radiology, and Google Cloud’s MedLM now gives us the opportunity to level up and push further.”\n\nAashima Gupta, Global Director, Healthcare Strategy and Solutions at Google Cloud, explains that there is significant opportunity in the field of radiology to leverage artificial intelligence technology and generate content for the purposes of ultimately improving the care delivery process: “as the amount of medical imaging grows, we can equip radiologists with more robust platforms and technologies to make their workflows more efficient and accurate.”\n\nGupta alludes to an important aspect about the field of radiology; a key study in the European Journal of Radiology found that there has been a significant overall increase in the use of radiological imaging and corresponding workload for radiologists over the past 16 years. Another study published in Academic Radiology took a deep dive into causative factors for burnout in radiologists and found numerous systemic and workflow factors leading to increasing levels of attrition.\n\nBut the healthcare ecosystem cannot afford to lose radiologists due to burnout, given just how essential this function is for patient care. This is why companies are heavily investing with an unprecedented focus on radiology, hoping to leverage the latest in artificial intelligence technology. Notably, scientists and leaders are approaching this phenomenon cautiously: extensive studies are being conducted and funded to measure the efficacy of AI in radiology and its levels of accuracy. Regarding this factor, Gurson emphasizes that even with technologies such as Rad AI, it will ultimately be important for a human radiologist to review the outputs and provide the final sign-off, keeping the “human in the loop.”\n\nNevertheless, these are just early days for the intersection of artificial intelligence and radiology. Undoubtedly, the scale and speed at which this technology is growing indicates that there is still a lot of work to be done; however, if executed correctly, there is significant promise to potentially create positive impact.",

      "# [Products, Competitors, Financials, Employees, Headquarters Locations](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/rad-ai)\nGenAI in radiology: a suture for the global physician shortage?\n\nIn radiology, GenAI holds the potential to stave off radiologist burnout and realise greater personalisation of patient care. Share GenAI in radiology holds the potential to drive efficiencies and improve diagnosis. Speaking at a JP Morgan conference in January 2024, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang declared that “this year, every industry will become a technology industry”. During the fireside chat, which preceded NVIDIA ’s March launch of a suite of 25 generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) based microservices designed for imaging and other protocols made available through the company’s cloud-based tech stack, Huang said medical instruments were soon “never going to be the same again”. Go deeper with GlobalData “Ultrasound systems, computed tomography (CT) scan systems, all kinds of instruments – they’re always going to be a device plus a whole bunch of AIs,” said Huang. This year, NVIDIA and other big tech players, including Microsoft , have made further moves in the field of radiology to make this a reality, forging partnerships with academic institutions to test and develop GenAI foundation models for radiology. Foundation models are a form of GenAI that analyse vast unstructured datasets. Using a protocol called transfer learning, the hardware in these models can be trained and made applicable to specific fields and present a straightforward means for healthcare systems to adopt GenAI.

In addition, radiology represents an especially compelling field for the application of GenAI due to the longstanding reality that radiologists are in short supply on a global scale. A 2023 report by the Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) found that the UK currently has a 30% shortfall in radiologists that is forecast to rise to 40% by 2028 unless meaningful action is taken, with seven in ten clinical directors stating there were not enough radiologists to deliver safe and effective levels of patient care. Another report by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) forecasts that the radiologist shortfall in the US could reach almost 42,000 by 2036. Driving efficiencies in radiology The obvious application of GenAI in radiology lies in improving image quality and aiding physicians in identifying patterns in radiologic images they may not have noticed. While plenty of startups are at work on developing tools for this specific area – either to automatically straighten up or enhance the fidelity of CT and other imaging scans – Rad AI co-founder Jeff Chang sees GenAI’s foremost application in radiology as taking the load off of radiologists by assisting with report summarisation. As a trained radiologist, Chang calls this one of the most time-consuming tasks undertaken by radiologists. “When you think about what radiologists actually do, we spend most of our time dictating reports,” says Chang. Looking at radiology images is the straightforward aspect of a radiologist’s role, Chang says, and there are certain patterns radiologists readily pick out and take note of for their evaluations. “But then, we spend most of our time dictating the report, and we’re dictating 100-200 reports per day, and so the way to save radiologists time is to reduce the amount of time they spend dictating. “Our first product, which we released in 2019, automatically generates the last third of the radiology report, which includes the impression section, conclusions, summarisation, and follow up recommendations. “That way, as soon as a radiologist dictates what they see on the images, which forms the first part of the report, our product automatically generates the last part.” According to Chang, Rad AI’s product saves physicians a median of around one hour per nine-hour shift. GenAI in radiology also presents an opportunity for personalising patient care, with the ability to synthesise patients’ healthcare history data by connecting datasets from different kinds of radiology together. “If, for example, a patient in a healthcare system is getting ultrasounds plus CT scans, plus MRI, all of those can be stitched together, to really see the patient journey and include that patient’s clinical information,” says Emily Lewis, AI, and innovation lead at biopharmaceutical company UCB . “This is an important aspect in being able to personalise that patient’s care and put a treatment plan together.” GenAI challenges GenAI is not currently a foolproof tool since foundation models often get trained on broad datasets, and there is no telling whether all of the information is accurate. Incorrect data or misleading conclusions presented by a GenAI model are known as hallucinations, and a recent study by AI startup Mendel and the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst), which detects hallucinations in AI-generated medical summaries, concluded that they remain a “grave” concern to the healthcare industry. “We work with over half a billion radiology reports from all across the US, so being able to have that clinical context, having the pre-processing and post-processing capabilities to ensure clinical accuracy, you have to be using a product that does all of that for it to be successful in clinical use,” notes Chang. Emily Lewis’s view is that for GenAI systems being used in radiology, keeping a human in the loop to monitor their performance will be needed for the foreseeable future. “Up until now, AI models have been predicting the next word. It’s just a stochastic parrot where it’s reiterating what it’s been trained on. And because it’s been trained on the entire internet, it’s not necessarily trained on factual information.” This may soon change, however, with the recent release of OpenAI’s 01. According to the company, the models are designed to spend more time thinking before they respond, meaning they can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science, coding, and mathematics. “They’re trying to anchor in more trusted data from respected sources and have that reasoning component,” says Lewis. “There should be national standards for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of models, as well as local validation. “A lot of that is going to fall on clinical health systems to understand, to have metrics on their models, and make sure they’re monitoring them over the long term.” According to Lewis, this is an especially heavy burden for local level healthcare centres and the main reason why the application of AI in the US is predominantly being seen at large medical centres and academic institutions. “These gold standard places have the funding, resourcing, and a lot of the expertise. It is yet to be seen how this is going to translate to the community health centres of the world.” Pre-trained with radiologic specificity In essence, foundation models are only as good as the data that adopters train them on. Ethical and privacy concerns and the cost around data acquisition are all playing a role in this challenge, and potentially a lack of regulation around AI on the part of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For radiology, the remedy to the issue of potentially unreliable or plainly limited data to work upon exists in pre-trained, radiology-specific foundation models such as Australia-based Harrison.ai’s dialogue-based LLM, Harrison.rad.1. This emergent alternative is different to the provision of foundation models that adopters then have to train on their own potentially limited datasets, or worse, unvalidated radiological images pulled from the internet. “Harrison.rad.1 has been trained on real-world, diverse and proprietary clinical data, comprising millions of radiological images, studies and reports,” explains Harrison.ai CEO Dr Aengus Tran. “The dataset has further been annotated at scale by a large team of medical specialists to provide Harrison.rad.1 with clinically accurate training information.” Tran demonstrates this by highlighting the performance of the company’s AI in radiology examinations designed for human radiologists, and claims that Harrison.rad has outperformed other foundational models in several benchmarks. “Specifically, it surpasses other foundational models on the challenging Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists (FRCR) 2B Rapids examination – an exam that only 40%-59% of human radiologists pass on their first attempt. “When reattempted within a year of passing, radiologists score an average of 50.88 out of 60. Harrison.rad.1 performed on par with accredited and experienced radiologists at 51.4 out of 60, while other competing models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google ’s Gemini-1.5 Pro and Microsoft ’s LLaVA-Med scored below 30 on average.” The potential for GenAI to play an appreciable role in improving existing processes in radiology and alleviating pressures on radiologists in healthcare systems is clear, but barriers remain around the costs associated with the adoption and effective deployment of GenAI, along with the acquisition of sufficient data resources to make adoption worthwhile, although radiology-specific companies offering pre-trained foundation models are changing this. Once regulation around AI in the US catches up with the rate of innovation, and as adoption of the technology in radiology continues, GenAI’s longevity and its true role in transforming the radiology space for the better should become clear.
