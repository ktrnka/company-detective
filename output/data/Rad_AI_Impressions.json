      "# [Save Time and Decrease Burnout with Radiology AI Software](https://www.radai.com/)\nRad AI Continuity is the most comprehensive follow-up management platform on the market, tracking more than 50 categories of incidental findings and significantly increasing patient follow-up rates. We’re very excited about this collaboration as it will allow us to have improved visibility and provide a safety net over our entire patient population to ensure our patients feel informed and empowered.\n\nWith Continuity, we have a 100% radiology safety net. Every single radiology report that comes in with an incidental finding has been communicated to the appropriate stakeholders. We're tracking whether or not those follow-ups happen within the appropriate, recommended timeframe mitigating all our liability to ensure that we keep patients in our network.\n\nThe amazing thing about Rad AI Reporting is that you're able to achieve exponential efficiency gains, but with less perceived effort. It doesn't benefit you if you're going faster but you know you're going fast because you're more fatigued. The idea is to smooth things out in a way where you're almost in a flow state, and Rad AI Reporting does that.\n\nHaving greatly benefited from using Rad AI Impressions, we are thrilled to add Continuity to our current partnership with the team at Rad AI. The management of incidental findings in radiology reports is a key focus for our group as it’s incredibly beneficial for the patients we serve. After evaluating every vendor in this space, we found that Continuity provides the most automated and most comprehensive solution in follow-up management.\n\nIt gives you the ability to generate a complete report in the interpreting radiologist's own language, whether you use structured reporting or dictate freely, just by dictating the pertinent findings. This saves an enormous amount of wasted energy in having to create full sentences.\n\nRad AI Impressions is what we have all been waiting for! Providing much-needed efficiency gains in my daily workflow life is sometimes absolutely surreal! It is like I have my own trainee who perfectly excels at impressions.\n\nUsing Rad AI Impressions to auto-generate my impressions has been wonderful. I’ve gotten to use it on overnight shifts, and it’s a game changer. It really helps with breezing through case volume with less fatigue.\n\nWhile hard to measure in minutes or seconds or even dollars, one huge value is the \"coffee sip\" factor. Before Rad AI Impressions, I was talking all the time and my cup of coffee in the morning would inevitably get cold. With Rad AI impressions, I get just long enough of a break to take a sip of warm coffee. And each time I sip my warm coffee, I smile.\n\nRad AI exceeded radiologist expectations out of the gate. Seamless integration permitted our radiologists to immediately realize the efficiencies of the Rad AI Impressions platform. With Rad AI, our radiologists reported feeling less stressed with more time available to review studies or tend to other tasks. This is exactly the type of IT solution needed to help reduce radiologists’ burnout and boost job satisfaction.\n\nHaving greatly benefited from using Rad AI Impressions, we are thrilled to add Continuity to our current partnership with the team at Rad AI. The management of incidental findings in radiology reports is a key focus for our group as it’s incredibly beneficial for the patients we serve. After evaluating every vendor in this space, we found that Continuity provides the most automated and most comprehensive solution in follow-up management.\n\nWe have seen how critical it is to close the loop on significant incidental findings and what a challenging problem it is to address using our currently available resources. By automating the majority of steps related to patient follow-ups, Rad AI removes those manual tasks from our clinical team and gives them back more time to focus on caring for their patients.\n\nWhen we recently discussed our expansions and renewals for AI solutions, we saw Rad AI as a must-have. If we were to rank our solutions, it's at the top. With a high volume of high acuity cases, Rad AI Impressions helps us manage our caseload. The performance continues to improve -- in 90 to 95% of the impressions that it generates, I don't have to edit anything, and the consensus guideline recommendations are working really well.\n\nWe are committed to the patients and healthcare entities we serve, and we believe that partnering with Rad AI will improve the efficiency of our radiologists and increase the value associated with our services. We look forward to using Rad AI Impressions' automated impression technology to make our radiologists more effective and to help decrease burnout.\n\nRad AI Impressions will assist our radiologists in providing the highest-quality reports, while greatly reducing the rework that is built into the process. We’re excited to partner with Rad AI, as the feedback we’ve received from other Strategic Radiology members nationally has been overwhelmingly positive, and we’re looking forward to the same experience at our practice.\n\nWe’ve been incredibly pleased with the partnership that has developed with Rad AI. As a CIO, your aim is to make investments in technology that make a tangible difference throughout the practice. Once the Rad AI Impressions rollout began, the benefits spread 'word of mouth' style like a brushfire. The radiologists became the largest supporters of the product – touting the efficiency, quality and overall reduction in fatigue improvements amongst themselves. Expansion of the agreement was a no-brainer. I would strongly encourage any radiology practice CIO seeking an impactful AI investment to prioritize a relationship with Rad AI.\n\nEven though Rad AI has an incredible reputation in the radiology community, we were hesitant to try AI in our practice and wanted to prove it out for ourselves. After using Rad AI Impressions with a small initial set of users, we are so glad we did as we saw an immediate impact. We are now rapidly expanding to the rest of the radiologists in our practice.\n\nAfter thoroughly evaluating numerous radiology AI solutions via our collaborative we believe Rad AI Impressions will provide the most impactful value proposition for our member groups. Rad AI impressions' automated impression generator extracted from the radiologist’s dictated findings not only results in enhanced report quality and efficiency, but also helps alleviate fatigue by the end of a shift.\n\nI knew from the first time I used Rad AI Impressions it would be a complete game-changer by allowing us to turn around the highest-quality reports faster with fewer addenda. Of all the technology and solutions that we’ve implemented for our practice, Rad AI Impressions has made the biggest impact on our efficiency and quality. I have personally reached out to colleagues of mine to prioritize a partnership with Rad AI.\n\nOur practice has been on the forefront of innovation in radiology, building on our heritage of leading the way with transformative technologies that ultimately prove to become the gold standard for radiology practices. We believe our partnership with Rad AI will enable us to maintain this type of technological leadership, and Rad AI Impressions will be a powerfully assistive tool for our radiologists.\n\nWe expanded our partnership with Rad AI to every radiologist not just because of the benefits our radiologists experienced, but also because the Rad AI team is incredible to work with. They truly listen and prioritize our feedback.\n\nOur initial group of radiologist users were very impressed by Rad AI’s ability to reduce fatigue and improve productivity using artificial intelligence, while improving the quality of patient care. We evaluate many AI vendors, and Rad AI proved to not only be a valuable solution our radiologists wanted to use, but they’ve also been a fantastic partner in helping us fully leverage the power of AI to do more for our patients.\n\nIt’s important to Inland Imaging to remain at the forefront of implementing groundbreaking technology to best serve our patients and provide the optimal environment for our radiologists to do their best work. Our radiologists are impressed with the efficiency gains, quality gains, and reduction in fatigue. Rad AI is an ideal partner that is both innovative and customer-focused, and places a premium on developing long-term partnerships.\n\nRad AI has made a big difference in my daily productivity and endurance throughout my day. I am now less mentally fatigued towards the end of my day because I do not have the added mental strain of summarizing my findings in the impression. The program does it for me. I also find myself catching more voice recognition errors when I read over the generated impression which allows me to go back and fix these errors in the body of the report… an added bonus!",

I would strongly encourage any radiology practice CIO seeking an impactful AI investment to prioritize a relationship with Rad AI.\n\nEven though Rad AI has an incredible reputation in the radiology community, we were hesitant to try AI in our practice and wanted to prove it out for ourselves. After using Rad AI Impressions with a small initial set of users, we are so glad we did as we saw an immediate impact. We are now rapidly expanding to the rest of the radiologists in our practice.\n\nAfter thoroughly evaluating numerous radiology AI solutions via our collaborative we believe Rad AI Impressions will provide the most impactful value proposition for our member groups. Rad AI impressions' automated impression generator extracted from the radiologist’s dictated findings not only results in enhanced report quality and efficiency, but also helps alleviate fatigue by the end of a shift.\n\nI knew from the first time I used Rad AI Impressions it would be a complete game-changer by allowing us to turn around the highest-quality reports faster with fewer addenda. Of all the technology and solutions that we’ve implemented for our practice, Rad AI Impressions has made the biggest impact on our efficiency and quality. I have personally reached out to colleagues of mine to prioritize a partnership with Rad AI.\n\nOur practice has been on the forefront of innovation in radiology, building on our heritage of leading the way with transformative technologies that ultimately prove to become the gold standard for radiology practices. We believe our partnership with Rad AI will enable us to maintain this type of technological leadership, and Rad AI Impressions will be a powerfully assistive tool for our radiologists.\n\nWe expanded our partnership with Rad AI to every radiologist not just because of the benefits our radiologists experienced, but also because the Rad AI team is incredible to work with. They truly listen and prioritize our feedback.\n\nOur initial group of radiologist users were very impressed by Rad AI’s ability to reduce fatigue and improve productivity using artificial intelligence, while improving the quality of patient care. We evaluate many AI vendors, and Rad AI proved to not only be a valuable solution our radiologists wanted to use, but they’ve also been a fantastic partner in helping us fully leverage the power of AI to do more for our patients.\n\nIt’s important to Inland Imaging to remain at the forefront of implementing groundbreaking technology to best serve our patients and provide the optimal environment for our radiologists to do their best work. Our radiologists are impressed with the efficiency gains, quality gains, and reduction in fatigue. Rad AI is an ideal partner that is both innovative and customer-focused, and places a premium on developing long-term partnerships.\n\nRad AI has made a big difference in my daily productivity and endurance throughout my day. I am now less mentally fatigued towards the end of my day because I do not have the added mental strain of summarizing my findings in the impression. The program does it for me. I also find myself catching more voice recognition errors when I read over the generated impression which allows me to go back and fix these errors in the body of the report… an added bonus!",

      "# [Reimagining the Standup](https://www.radai.com/blogs/reimagining-the-standup)\nStandups\n\nIt seems like every team that I’ve been on holds some flavor of daily “stand-up” meeting. Especially once hybrid and remote work became necessarily en vogue, a daily standing meeting seemed a panacea to a whole host of modern organizational ailments. Thus a new breed of meeting was born, justified with all the original big-meeting killing rationale of Agile™️ processes, but often missing the forest for the trees, driving teams back into the daily slump of boring meetings. It’s worth raising the question of whether your own well-meaning daily exercise has decayed into something that no longer serves its intended purpose - it happens easily!\n\nStand by me!\n\nAs my engineering dinosaur feathers grow in, I recall a distant time when my team would gather around our lead’s desk in a tight circle every day in the morning. Each of my teammates had straggled in, oriented themselves to what was on their plate for the day, and came ready to talk. We exchanged information with tight, cross-talking fluidity - and the name wasn’t a coincidence! It was an actual “standing” meeting, in that we would be on our feet, giving us all a little more pressure to keep the meeting quick, functional, and effective.\n\nFast forward a few years, and though most of the team was still in the same office, technology allowed teams to become vastly distributed across time and space. Remote communication made the distributed standup possible for the first time, but it became much trickier to pull off effectively. For one thing, there simply was no “first thing in the morning” that worked for everyone, so while SF engineers were just starting their day, folks on the East Coast were already finished with lunch. For a hybrid team, if part of the team WAS in-person, it meant the remote folks needed to be represented by a laptop or situated far against the wall on a screen. And for the remote callers on the other side of that screen, the daily ritual became entirely detached, with A/V issues often making their compatriots seem even further away. I remember being the guy on the screen when I first transitioned into a remote role - couldn’t help but feel like the kid standing just outside the circle on the playground.\n\nEventually, fully remote teams became far more the norm for me, and customary stand-ups followed, though by this point they had become something pretty far removed from the rose-tinted desk huddles of my distant memory. The daily video call was seen as an exercise de rigeur, even as its effectiveness dwindled.\n\nSo why are we still imposing this small daily burden? Well, it does have its good points…\n\nWhen it's bad\n\nThe audience in the room has grown so large and generalized, that many people just aren’t concerned with a large portion of the others’ day-to-day work, and can’t even really remember what everyone has said even if they wanted to. Peripheral players get included just for the sake of inclusion and team building, even if their work is not relevant to others on a day-to-day basis. Meetings drag on endlessly so everyone gets their turn.\n\nTeam members start viewing their “share” as less of a way to exchange vital information others need, and more as a laundry list of boxes that have been, or will be checked.\n\nMost of the communication devolves into people speaking directly to their manager, with an inherent (usually false) assumption that every other team member is listening intently and effectively, absorbing each cumulative update.\n\nWhen it’s ugly\n\nThe standup is considered the one and only time during the day that the team gets together, and so starts filling the place of other, more casual and focused small group decision meetings. As the duration stretches out longer, participants’ attention wanders to the myriad distractions lying in other windows. Everyone looks effectively busy, while important decisions get lost in the chaos.\n\nManagers view the standup as an opportunity to re-prioritize an IC’s work on a day-to-day basis, eroding their pillar of autonomy before the first cup of coffee.\n\nStatus exchange effectiveness grinds to near zero, with team members having to chase each other down for followup conversations, despite holding a daily, expensive meeting\n\nWhat to do?\n\nKnowing that these meetings can quickly lose their effectiveness once a distributed team grows, what can be done to retain a stand-up meeting’s value?\n\nKeep the guest list tight\n\nOnce there are about 7 people in the circle, the group starts to reach the limits of attention and memory. One of our Engineering Managers, Catherine Fleres, likes to abide by the “Two-Pizza Rule” - if it takes more than that to adequately feed everyone in a meeting, there are too many people at the table! Strive to keep standup groups to just relevant stakeholders in a focused topic. Organize into squads, and split meetings ruthlessly. If there are other, larger team-wide broadcasts that need to be made, consider alternate channels or meeting formats.\n\nConsider actually standing\n\nTeammates think I’m crazy when I suggest this, because it involves an extremely awkward coordinated dance of adjusting cameras, changing desk heights, and just generally looking silly in a room alone. Strange as it seems, the physiological pressure of being in a less-than-leisurely body pose can help keep shares nice and short - direct and to the point.\n\nTake discussions offline… ruthlessly …\n\nIt starts innocently enough: a status update sparks a question, and the answer is detailed and complex, which sparks a follow-up from the original speaker. Before they even realize it, the two participants have taken the meeting off the rails, and everybody else’s eyes are slowly glazing over as they hash out the finer points. Develop a team culture for tabling those important conversations compassionately, and following up after the group has dispersed. It can feel rude to have to police this, so it’s especially important that everybody is bought in and held accountable, and understands a shared signal to move it along. Encourage followups to happen in a separate “space”, so that there is a clear signal that uninterested parties are not obligated to attend.\n\nOptimize for broadband communication\n\nStanding meetings can sometimes grow large to accommodate the schedule of a single individual who has become the hub from which all others are spokes. The entire meeting degrades from n to n communication to serial bursts of 1:1 exchanges with that single person. This is often indicative of larger organizational chokepoints, and a good hint it’s time to delegate responsibility more broadly and spread the load.\n\nMake space for other group collaboration\n\nIs the daily standup the only place where group communication happens on your team? Do decisions get rushed, because they have to be made while a roomful of disinterested folks wait for their turn? Do important announcements get forgotten, buried in a laundry list of mundane updates? Make room for the longer discussions, note their importance, and encourage them to happen in a properly framed meeting venue with strictly the interested parties.\n\nDouble down on autonomy\n\nIt’s common to justify a daily gathering as a way of tracking team accountability. Tickets closed, code merged, charts burnt down. Around the table, the ICs get the message that they need to justify their existence (perhaps to their manager?), and so their shares become a list of yesterday’s accomplishments. The meetings transform into a status dump for a theoretically rapt listener than effective team communication. Think about this - in your own daily meetings, to what audience is the speaker framing their share? Do participants seem like they’re collaborating and engaging with each other, or mostly to the manager? If your meeting culture expects every detail to be reported up the chain on a daily cadence, it can easily undermine an IC’s sense of work autonomy. It leaves the door open for unwelcome scrutiny, micro-management, and ultimately starts to wear on motivation and engagement.\n\nWhile managerial demands for daily status checks seem reasonable, they are often unnecessary, and reinforce the notion that work could deviate wildly from sprint plans at any time. I like the analogy to a cruise ship; you can make course corrections on the scale of sprint cycles, but the ship, like your dev’s psyches, may be too big to turn on a dime. Escaping the notion of “stand-up as status report” can help managers plan more realistically, and workers feel safe in predictable work expectations. Consider incorporating automated status tracking into organization tooling, so that a developer’s normal workflow triggers updates in a board or charts visible to managers. This can help alleviate the concern that work isn’t happening, even over the distances that remote teams require.\n\nIf all else fails, Slack up!\n\nA common solution to the woes of unfortunate stand-ups is to switch to an “async” model, where team members leave their updates in a Slack channel or other team collaboration tool, as they come online for the day. This format alleviates a lot of the pains of having to convey status to others without making awkward time demands, so is a favorite of the meeting-averse. However, this is hardly a suitable replacement. In theory, each team member is consuming everyone else’s updates, but in practice that rarely holds. The features that defined the format get lost - psychological pressure keeping updates brief and effective has vanished, the laundry list mentality gets exacerbated, and it’s way too easy to let the audience in the channel grow too large. This is often the last iteration of the meeting format before the whole exercise is scrapped as unhelpful.\n\nStanding together as a team\n\nWhether you’re analyzing user experience or plotting out team processes, success or failure depends greatly on how your stakeholders feel. When engineers report “feeling” burnout, often the first thing they call out is energy-sapping meetings - being held captive on camera while other people talk about irrelevant distractions. On the other hand, some teams will point to a daily meeting as the time they feel most like a single, sleek operating unit, and this carries through the rest of their day. A well-run standup can go a long way towards maintaining sanity in your schedule, realistic expectations of your peers, and predictable synergy on your team. Invest in doing it right.",

      "# [Launch Day 2024](https://www.radai.com/events/launch-day-2024)\nRad AI Continuity is the most comprehensive follow-up management platform on the market, tracking more than 50 categories of incidental findings and significantly increasing patient follow-up rates. We’re very excited about this collaboration as it will allow us to have improved visibility and provide a safety net over our entire patient population to ensure our patients feel informed and empowered.\n\nWith Continuity, we have a 100% radiology safety net. Every single radiology report that comes in with an incidental finding has been communicated to the appropriate stakeholders. We're tracking whether or not those follow-ups happen within the appropriate, recommended timeframe mitigating all our liability to ensure that we keep patients in our network.\n\nThe amazing thing about Rad AI Reporting is that you're able to achieve exponential efficiency gains, but with less perceived effort. It doesn't benefit you if you're going faster but you know you're going fast because you're more fatigued. The idea is to smooth things out in a way where you're almost in a flow state, and Rad AI Reporting does that.\n\nHaving greatly benefited from using Rad AI Impressions, we are thrilled to add Continuity to our current partnership with the team at Rad AI. The management of incidental findings in radiology reports is a key focus for our group as it’s incredibly beneficial for the patients we serve. After evaluating every vendor in this space, we found that Continuity provides the most automated and most comprehensive solution in follow-up management.\n\nIt gives you the ability to generate a complete report in the interpreting radiologist's own language, whether you use structured reporting or dictate freely, just by dictating the pertinent findings. This saves an enormous amount of wasted energy in having to create full sentences.\n\nRad AI Impressions is what we have all been waiting for! Providing much-needed efficiency gains in my daily workflow life is sometimes absolutely surreal! It is like I have my own trainee who perfectly excels at impressions.\n\nUsing Rad AI Impressions to auto-generate my impressions has been wonderful. I’ve gotten to use it on overnight shifts, and it’s a game changer. It really helps with breezing through case volume with less fatigue.\n\nWhile hard to measure in minutes or seconds or even dollars, one huge value is the \"coffee sip\" factor. Before Rad AI Impressions, I was talking all the time and my cup of coffee in the morning would inevitably get cold. With Rad AI impressions, I get just long enough of a break to take a sip of warm coffee. And each time I sip my warm coffee, I smile.\n\nRad AI exceeded radiologist expectations out of the gate. Seamless integration permitted our radiologists to immediately realize the efficiencies of the Rad AI Impressions platform. With Rad AI, our radiologists reported feeling less stressed with more time available to review studies or tend to other tasks. This is exactly the type of IT solution needed to help reduce radiologists’ burnout and boost job satisfaction.\n\nHaving greatly benefited from using Rad AI Impressions, we are thrilled to add Continuity to our current partnership with the team at Rad AI. The management of incidental findings in radiology reports is a key focus for our group as it’s incredibly beneficial for the patients we serve. After evaluating every vendor in this space, we found that Continuity provides the most automated and most comprehensive solution in follow-up management.\n\nWe have seen how critical it is to close the loop on significant incidental findings and what a challenging problem it is to address using our currently available resources. By automating the majority of steps related to patient follow-ups, Rad AI removes those manual tasks from our clinical team and gives them back more time to focus on caring for their patients.\n\nWhen we recently discussed our expansions and renewals for AI solutions, we saw Rad AI as a must-have. If we were to rank our solutions, it's at the top. With a high volume of high acuity cases, Rad AI Impressions helps us manage our caseload. The performance continues to improve -- in 90 to 95% of the impressions that it generates, I don't have to edit anything, and the consensus guideline recommendations are working really well.\n\nWe are committed to the patients and healthcare entities we serve, and we believe that partnering with Rad AI will improve the efficiency of our radiologists and increase the value associated with our services. We look forward to using Rad AI Impressions' automated impression technology to make our radiologists more effective and to help decrease burnout.\n\nRad AI Impressions will assist our radiologists in providing the highest-quality reports, while greatly reducing the rework that is built into the process. We’re excited to partner with Rad AI, as the feedback we’ve received from other Strategic Radiology members nationally has been overwhelmingly positive, and we’re looking forward to the same experience at our practice.\n\nWe’ve been incredibly pleased with the partnership that has developed with Rad AI. As a CIO, your aim is to make investments in technology that make a tangible difference throughout the practice. Once the Rad AI Impressions rollout began, the benefits spread 'word of mouth' style like a brushfire. The radiologists became the largest supporters of the product – touting the efficiency, quality and overall reduction in fatigue improvements amongst themselves. Expansion of the agreement was a no-brainer. I would strongly encourage any radiology practice CIO seeking an impactful AI investment to prioritize a relationship with Rad AI.\n\nEven though Rad AI has an incredible reputation in the radiology community, we were hesitant to try AI in our practice and wanted to prove it out for ourselves. After using Rad AI Impressions with a small initial set of users, we are so glad we did as we saw an immediate impact. We are now rapidly expanding to the rest of the radiologists in our practice.\n\nAfter thoroughly evaluating numerous radiology AI solutions via our collaborative we believe Rad AI Impressions will provide the most impactful value proposition for our member groups. Rad AI impressions' automated impression generator extracted from the radiologist’s dictated findings not only results in enhanced report quality and efficiency, but also helps alleviate fatigue by the end of a shift.\n\nI knew from the first time I used Rad AI Impressions it would be a complete game-changer by allowing us to turn around the highest-quality reports faster with fewer addenda. Of all the technology and solutions that we’ve implemented for our practice, Rad AI Impressions has made the biggest impact on our efficiency and quality. I have personally reached out to colleagues of mine to prioritize a partnership with Rad AI.\n\nOur practice has been on the forefront of innovation in radiology, building on our heritage of leading the way with transformative technologies that ultimately prove to become the gold standard for radiology practices. We believe our partnership with Rad AI will enable us to maintain this type of technological leadership, and Rad AI Impressions will be a powerfully assistive tool for our radiologists.\n\nWe expanded our partnership with Rad AI to every radiologist not just because of the benefits our radiologists experienced, but also because the Rad AI team is incredible to work with. They truly listen and prioritize our feedback.\n\nOur initial group of radiologist users were very impressed by Rad AI’s ability to reduce fatigue and improve productivity using artificial intelligence, while improving the quality of patient care. We evaluate many AI vendors, and Rad AI proved to not only be a valuable solution our radiologists wanted to use, but they’ve also been a fantastic partner in helping us fully leverage the power of AI to do more for our patients.\n\nIt’s important to Inland Imaging to remain at the forefront of implementing groundbreaking technology to best serve our patients and provide the optimal environment for our radiologists to do their best work. Our radiologists are impressed with the efficiency gains, quality gains, and reduction in fatigue. Rad AI is an ideal partner that is both innovative and customer-focused, and places a premium on developing long-term partnerships.\n\nRad AI has made a big difference in my daily productivity and endurance throughout my day. I am now less mentally fatigued towards the end of my day because I do not have the added mental strain of summarizing my findings in the impression. The program does it for me. I also find myself catching more voice recognition errors when I read over the generated impression which allows me to go back and fix these errors in the body of the report… an added bonus!",
      "# [Rad AI Reporting](https://app.radai.com/docs/fhircast/)\nFHIRcast\n\nFHIRcast is a standard developed to provide real-time synchronization and context sharing between healthcare applications. It builds on the foundations of FHIR resources, but focuses specifically on ensuring that multiple applications remain synchronized in real-time as users interact with them.\n\nFHIRcast requires a centralized system to manage real-time synchronization and context sharing. This system is referred to as a “FHIRcast hub”.\n\nHere’s how FHIRcast works:\n\nSubscription setup: Applications subscribe to a FHIRcast hub for specific events. This is typically done during application startup.\n\nEvent triggering: When a user interacts with an application (e.g., opens a patient record or an imaging study), the application sends an event to the FHIRcast hub.\n\nReal-time notification: The FHIRcast hub immediately broadcasts this event to all subscribed applications via WebSockets, ensuring they are notified in real-time.\n\nContext synchronization: Subscribed applications receive the event notification and adjust their context accordingly. For example, if an imaging study is opened in one application, other applications might display related patient information or open the same study.\n\nA radiologist opens an imaging study in their PACS.\n\nThe PACS sends an event to the FHIRcast hub, indicating that the ImagingStudy FHIR resource has been opened.\n\nThe FHIRcast hub broadcasts this event to all subscribed applications, including the Rad AI Reporting application.\n\nThe Rad AI Reporting application receives the notification and automatically opens the same ImagingStudy, ready for the radiologist to dictate their findings into a new report.",
      "# [The Future of AI in Radiology](https://www.radai.com/webinars/the-future-of-ai-in-radiology)\nDr. Eliot Siegel, Vice Chair of Imaging Informatics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, joined Rad AI to discuss the future of AI in radiology. Dr. Sonia Gupta, AI thought leader and abdominal radiologist, moderated the discussion.\n\nDr. Gupta: Thank you to everyone who tuned into our webinar. I think it's really exciting for us to have this great turnout and shows how much engagement and excitement there is about AI in radiology.\n\nDr. Siegel began the discussion by describing where artificial intelligence will have the greatest impact in the near term.\n\nDr. Siegel: For me, the most important thing that AI can be applied to is actually the radiology report itself. So many developments in AI and natural language processing are allowing us to rethink the way we generate radiology reports and how we can do that more productively and efficiently. There’s incredible potential that we are not currently realizing to be able to significantly improve our efficiency and to reduce burnout as well.\n\nDr. Chang spoke about the impact Rad AI is having now in over 15% of the radiology market.\n\nDr. Chang: Rad AI Omni automatically generates the impression section of the radiology report, customized to each individual radiologist. It also handles automatic consensus guideline recommendations, helps with the automation of MIPS tracking (ensuring that the correct MIPS language is included in reports and improving billing language), reduces the need for addenda in reports, and provides error checking as well. We help radiologists by catching voice recognition typos, and other types of clinical errors in the report.\n\nSo this really saves radiologists time, reduces radiologist burnout, and improves the consistency and accuracy of reports. And because it gives you a little bit of a break after each complicated report, it makes people less stressed out -- it gives you a breather, so it reduces fatigue over the course of a day.\n\nDr. Gupta asked about how artificial intelligence can help serve as a virtual assistant for radiologists and reduce their burnout.\n\nDr. Gupta: At the same time that we have this increase in volume from the backlog of COVID-19, we also have decreasing reimbursement. And so unfortunately our survey data shows that 88% of US radiologists feel that they are at or over capacity and 25% of them say they're just unhappy being a radiologist.\n\nDr. Chang: When you're working really busy nights it's hard to always keep track of the incidental findings, always remember the different consensus guidelines and the latest recommendations, and be able to apply those appropriately at all times to create the best possible report.\n\nAnd so at Rad AI what we really tried to focus on is making sure to help the radiologist to be able to reduce the amount of cognitive load on every study so that we can automatically remember those incidental findings for you -- remember the consensus guideline recommendations to put them in automatically. That really helps alleviate some of the pressure from this high impact, non-stop imaging volume that we have on overnight shifts.\n\nFinally Dr. Siegel and Dr. Chang spoke about how artificial intelligence can help in closing the loop on significant incidental findings.\n\nDr. Siegel: We make so many findings, and so many recommendations, and so many suggestions for follow-up -- and yet there's not a mechanism to be able to track those.",

      "# [Rad AI Omni: The RANT Experience](https://www.radai.com/webinars/rad-ai-omni-the-rant-experience)\nRecently Rad AI hosted Dr. Nicholas Galante, Medical Director of Informatics at Radiology Associates of North Texas, as our special guest at our “AI in Practice” webinars series. Dr. Sonia Gupta, AI thought leader and abdominal radiologist, moderated the discussion.\n\nDr. Gupta: We are very excited today to have a round table to discuss RANT’s adoption of Rad AI Omni for their over 225 radiologists. They’re one of the largest private radiology practices in Texas and one of the largest in the nation. Dr. Galante, what was your perspective watching this deployment?\n\nDr. Galante: It was thankfully very smooth and very straightforward. Rad AI is an intuitive product and it’s very plug and play and very user-friendly. Basically from day one, it just comes out of the box and starts doing its thing and working alongside you. I just dove right in, and I think a lot of others dove right in as well.\n\nDr. Gupta: Well, were you skeptical that it would do what it says it’s supposed to do? Or just about AI in general?\n\nDr. Galante: Anytime you hear such great reviews, it's kind of like when you go to Yelp and you're reading restaurant reviews and it's gotten five stars over 3000 reviews. I think it puts in any kind of flaw under such a microscope because you're almost looking for it; so I was skeptical because of the reviews that were all overwhelmingly positive. But, it's scary good. I do some reports that are free form, some that are templated and just across all of this, it is incredibly good at modeling my voice. Maybe one of the best pieces of feedback I've heard is that sometimes it kind of knows your impression before you know it...I was skeptical, but it has made me a believer!\n\nDr. Gupta: You also mentioned in our press release that Rad AI is the first AI solution that made you appreciate the benefits of using AI in your work. Can you tell us more about that?\n\nDr. Galante: It's provided a tailwind and it’s giving you a boost. And again, just out of the box, it creates a palpable difference. There's the peace of mind not having to sign and then saying, “Oh, I forgot to include that pulmonary nodule, now I’ve got to put an addendum…” And so it's bringing down those pertinent findings that on a long complex ED report, you might have not thought to put those incidentals. It's got a proof checking measure, as well...if there's something in their impression that just grammatically is incorrect, chances are that it is because that's how you dictated it in the Finding section. So it's got that internal proof check as well, which I think really helps.\n\nDr. Gupta: Dr. Galante, could you tell us what you like the best about using Rad AI during your shifts?\n\nDr. Galante: It absolutely reduces fatigue. You're speaking less words, you're expending less energy. Also, there's the mental fatigue of just performing a repetitive task over and over again, having to synthesize your thoughts and bring those down into your impression. and also more time on images. I think that ultimately you spend more time interpreting the study, looking at the images, and there's a certain peace of mind that comes with that as well.\n\nDr. Gupta: We were talking about how sometimes we would just feel like a zombie after a really busy call shift? Have you noticed a change for yourself?",
      "# [Battling Radiology Burnout Without Sacrificing Productivity](https://www.radai.com/blogs/battling-radiology-burnout-without-sacrificing-productivity)\nHow have radiology workloads changed in the past two decades?\n\nA recent case study of a large general hospital found that radiology RVUs rose from 6,187 in 2006 to 24,584 in 2020 (297% increase over 15 years). In the same time period, the number of radiology staff in the hospital remained stagnant, indicating that individual workloads increased significantly. The results of this study build on a prior report which noted an increase of 70.3% annual work RVUs per full-time equivalent radiologist from 1991–92 to 2006–07. Rapidly growing radiology workloads (defined as the product of the number and complexity of examinations performed per time unit) in the past 20 years can largely be attributed to technological developments including voice recognition software, picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), and advanced cross sectional imaging techniques. Another factor has been the widespread adoption of defensive medicine practices and consequent medical imaging overutilization. Global imaging volume is expected to double in the next eight years, so the trend of rising radiology RVU expectations will likely continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhat is burnout, and how does workload relate to radiologist burnout?\n\nThe Maslach Burnout Inventory is a highly established method of measuring burnout, and it considers three primary symptoms - emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low sense of personal accomplishment. Radiologists experiencing burnout often feel unmotivated for work and lack compassion for their patients. Therefore, it negatively impacts public health by adversely affecting physicians’ clinical performance. Burnout can also contribute to absences from work, unprofessional behavior, unhealthy lifestyle habits, and premature retirement.\n\nIn 2016, the ACR Commission on Human Resources generated a list of ten risk factors for radiology burnout, which they ranked by an importance score determined by eight members on the commission. Reducing these factors is a shared responsibility between radiologists and health care organizations. Individual radiologists prevent burnout by striving to optimize their physical health, personal relationships, and pursuits outside of work. Seeking guidance from career coaches or mental health professionals when needed has also been shown to effectively reduce burnout rates. Organizations are responsible for acknowledging the problems contributing to burnout in their specific practices and encouraging open communication to cultivate a sense of collaboration and job control. Although social factors such as workplace isolation can be solved without modifying workloads, the two greatest factors of burnout, inadequate staffing and prolonged stress, both stem from workload expectations. Thus it is not surprising that increased workloads correlate with increased burnout rates.\n\nBack in 2003, an ACR study indicated that 93% of radiologists enjoyed their work. This was a higher level of satisfaction than most other physician specialties, but it was lower than the results of the equivalent 1995 ACR survey. Of the radiologists who reported low satisfaction in the study, more than half cited workload as a primary reason. Furthermore, radiologists who expressed dissatisfaction due to work overload felt the issue was serious enough that they were willing to accept proportionately lower income (i.e. take a 10% income cut for 10% reduction in workload). As with physicians overall, radiology job satisfaction has continued to decrease over time. Today more than 85% of US radiologists feel at or above full work capacity and approximately 70% of radiologists have experienced feelings of burnout.\n\nWhy hasn’t AI already led to reduced radiology burnout rates?\n\nGeoffrey Hinton is a Turing Award winning computer scientist known as one of the “Godfathers of AI.” Five years ago he declared, “We should stop training radiologists now; it’s just completely obvious that within five years deep learning is going to do better than radiologists.” Conversations about AI overtaking the work of radiologists have been so widespread throughout the past decade that it is now a factor for medical students moving away from radiology as their specialty choice. This discussion has only been further amplified by social media creating an inaccurate narrative around the speciality as easily replaceable with AI. However, current studies concede that previous speculations were overly optimistic and did not accurately consider regulatory processes and scarcity of training data.\n\nSince 2016, The FDA has approved 80+ AI algorithms for medical imaging, and ~30% of radiologists have adopted some form of AI into their practice. Most of these AI solutions have not lived up to the expectation of reducing the burden on radiologists. A group of Dutch researchers recently studied a random sample of 440 medical imaging studies published in 2019. They found that rather than being integrated into existing workflows and taking over tasks for radiologists, AI applications generally led to additional post-processing and interpretation time. As a result, 86% of AI-focused studies were actually associated with a higher workload for radiologists.\n\nHow is Rad AI Omni increasing efficiency and reducing burnout rates?\n\nRad AI Omni uses artificial intelligence to generate report impressions from dictated findings. Without adding a single click into existing workflows, Omni creates impressions which are customized to each radiologist’s language preferences in less than a couple seconds. Radiologists using Rad AI achieve time savings of an hour a day, allowing them to heighten their focus on the most specialized aspects of their work - expert imaging interpretation and diagnosis. Taking another look at the ACR’s list of risk factors for radiology burnout, the primary factor identified is inadequate staffing. Hiring more radiologists decreases workload by reducing the necessary productivity levels of each radiologist in the practice. Rad AI Omni instead minimizes the tedium and time required to read each study, thereby reducing workloads while maintaining or improving individual levels of productivity.",
      "# [Rad AI: Radiology Workflow-Focused AI](https://www.radai.com/blogs/rad-ai-radiology-workflow-focused-ai)\nThe lack of widespread adoption is multifactorial, explained in part by the cost and lack of reimbursement. The types of available algorithms likely also play a role in the lack of adoption. The majority of commercially available AI algorithms are imaging-focused, emphasizing triage of acute findings and providing a “second set of eyes.” Non-image interpretation AI solutions (scheduling, billing, workflow optimization, etc.) are less widely available.\n\nMy radiology group, Inland Imaging, is a private practice group in the Pacific Northwest consisting of over 100 radiologists, the vast majority of which are subspecialized. Despite evaluating numerous algorithms, we have not found an imaging-focused AI solution that “moved the needle” for our group. However, non-image interpretation AI solutions have the potential to make a meaningful impact, particularly solutions that streamline workflow and/or improve radiologist productivity.\n\nRad AI is an AI vendor whose primary product, Rad AI Omni, automatically generates the impression of radiology reports based on the findings. The algorithm is trained using thousands of reports for each individual radiologist and does surprisingly well mimicking the diction of the interpreting radiologist.\n\nDuring Inland’s initial use of Rad AI, it quickly became apparent that Rad AI Omni provided a significant time savings in the generation of the report impression, which translates to an opportunity for increased radiologist productivity. In addition to the time savings, the solicited radiologist feedback demonstrated that Rad AI Omni helped to reduce fatigue and the feeling of burnout by automating some of the monotonous and repetitive portions of dictated reports.\n\nAs a neuroradiologist, one example of Rad AI Omni eliminating a repetitive and monotonous task is in the impression generation on cross sectional degenerative spine reports. Radiologists often have a standardized format and style for these reports, which suits Rad AI Omni perfectly. While the impressions on these reports can be quite long, Rad AI Omni quickly and reliably synthesizes the impression using the same diction as the interpreting radiologist. This allows the radiologist time for a “last look” at the images. A normal workday may contain a dozen or more such reports. Different radiology subspecialties have similar examples of repetitive exams. Rad AI Omni excels in reducing the burden of these repetitive dictations, which reduces fatigue and leaves the radiologist feeling less drained at the end of the day.\n\nAnother product offered by Rad AI, called Rad AI Continuity, identifies and categorizes follow-up recommendations and confirms appropriateness and adherence to society guidelines. It then automates the communication of the recommendation to the patient and outpatient provider. Finally, it tracks adherence to follow-up recommendations and ensures that the loop is closed. Rad AI is constantly updating the Continuity program by adding tracking of new standardized follow-up recommendations. This automation and tracking results in increased compliance with clinically appropriate follow-up recommendations, improving quality and adding value to the radiologist work product.",

While the typical start-up culture of sexual harassment does not exist (truly a wonderful job of that), there are many, many micro-aggressions against women. Also, some \"favorite\" mid-level leaders treat other teammates terribly.

Knowing the heart of many people - I really tried to dismiss this. It quickly became clear that the expectation was for women to do the women's work. Heavy lifting before, during, and after events would be left to only female team members. Leadership would come halfway through the event, not acknowledge them, and leave before the event was over, often in dangerous cities or situations without offering to help. It's been elevated to the point that other companies noticed and offered to stay behind to ensure they had the necessary help. Leaders often complained about spending time with team members and repeatedly said they didn't like team-building activities, conferences, etc. Often, ideas and projects from the only female team member are claimed by other team members. Female team members are cut off in meetings, and important initiatives are not supported by leadership that is assigned to female team members. I would also caution you to provide feedback in the weekly employee surveys. Shortly after, a few began sharing their dissatisfaction; it was brought up in team meetings about \"negativity,\" and they were let go shortly after. A few \"favorites\" play games - what they say in private slack messages and publically are wildly different and borderline harassing. They will be publically praised in all team meetings while their abusive behavior towards other teammates is ignored. I truly don't think they are aware of the microaggressions (and likely could be addressed). Still, a few people on the team do the most outwardly blatantly toxic behaviors privately, and senior leadership is likely unaware. But because those individuals are constantly being praised \"as the only people on the team doing things correctly\" it isn't possible to bring up concerns.",

All meetings are recorded as the leadership cannot trust their employees to do work. It is amazing how much time people spend playing politics when there is not even a working product nor a market fit yet.\r\n\r\nAnimosity between cofounders as the CFO has taken over as CEO. While they claim that the company was built by radiologists for radiologists, the radiologist / ex-CEO has no power, always working alone at a corner of the office away from other employees. \"Automate radiologists' paycheck\" is the true culture of the company. Condescending memes about radiologists are posted publicly. The ML team is heavily inflated with a lot of ego. Be prepared to make avocado toasts for your manager. Their AI does not work and they cover up their flaws by not having tests, blotching usage stat, and blaming the radiologists for not being \"consistent\".\r\n\r\nThe current CEO has assembled an executive team of yes-people who are willing to play his game and support him no matter what. While they have no real autonomy, they are rewarded with promotions beyond their experience or competence. If you dare to disagree with him, you'd be ushered out of the back door. The day when shelter-in-place was in order, he was enraged and said \"Why don't we let the people who is going to die, die, instead of ruining the economy?!\" Employees who criticized his handling of COVID were layoff a week later due to \"performance issues\".\r\n\r\nXenophobic and sexist comments get toasted around regularly.

The team is very receptive to new ideas, as well as to people taking on new responsibilities when they feel ready\n- Fun, driven, intelligent group to work with. Given the relatively small team, everyone is an expert in their own niche and is more than willing to teach others\n- Meaningful product. Coming from medicine/academia, it's not uncommon to see companies designing for medical problems that don't exist, or that would not be easily integrated into existing systems. RAD AI does a great job at making sure each product would actually have direct clinical impact",

All meetings are recorded as the leadership cannot trust their employees to do work. It is amazing how much time people spend playing politics when there is not even a working product nor a market fit yet.\r\n\r\nAnimosity between cofounders as the CFO has taken over as CEO. While they claim that the company was built by radiologists for radiologists, the radiologist / ex-CEO has no power, always working alone at a corner of the office away from other employees. \"Automate radiologists' paycheck\" is the true culture of the company. Condescending memes about radiologists are posted publicly. The ML team is heavily inflated with a lot of ego. Be prepared to make avocado toasts for your manager. Their AI does not work and they cover up their flaws by not having tests, blotching usage stat, and blaming the radiologists for not being \"consistent\".\r\n\r\nThe current CEO has assembled an executive team of yes-people who are willing to play his game and support him no matter what. While they have no real autonomy, they are rewarded with promotions beyond their experience or competence. If you dare to disagree with him, you'd be ushered out of the back door. The day when shelter-in-place was in order, he was enraged and said \"Why don't we let the people who is going to die, die, instead of ruining the economy?!\" Employees who criticized his handling of COVID were layoff a week later due to \"performance issues\".\r\n\r\nXenophobic and sexist comments get toasted around regularly. I have never worked at a place less inclusive than Rad AI.",

While the typical start-up culture of sexual harassment does not exist (truly a wonderful job of that), there are many, many micro-aggressions against women. Also, some \"favorite\" mid-level leaders treat other teammates terribly. Intentionally set them up for failure, stab them in the back, and stop at nothing to elevate themselves - and that behavior is rewarded. This is going to breed a toxic, toxic culture if not quickly addressed.",
        "cons": "Everything started great - until I realized the lack of women in leadership positions. (Take a look at the website). Knowing the heart of many people - I really tried to dismiss this. It quickly became clear that the expectation was for women to do the women's work. Heavy lifting before, during, and after events would be left to only female team members. Leadership would come halfway through the event, not acknowledge them, and leave before the event was over, often in dangerous cities or situations without offering to help. It's been elevated to the point that other companies noticed and offered to stay behind to ensure they had the necessary help. Leaders often complained about spending time with team members and repeatedly said they didn't like team-building activities, conferences, etc. Often, ideas and projects from the only female team member are claimed by other team members. Female team members are cut off in meetings, and important initiatives are not supported by leadership that is assigned to female team members. I would also caution you to provide feedback in the weekly employee surveys. Shortly after, a few began sharing their dissatisfaction; it was brought up in team meetings about \"negativity,\" and they were let go shortly after. A few \"favorites\" play games - what they say in private slack messages and publically are wildly different and borderline harassing. They will be publically praised in all team meetings while their abusive behavior towards other teammates is ignored. I truly don't think they are aware of the microaggressions (and likely could be addressed). Still, a few people on the team do the most outwardly blatantly toxic behaviors privately, and senior leadership is likely unaware. But because those individuals are constantly being praised \"as the only people on the team doing things correctly\" it isn't possible to bring up concerns.",

With the need to enhance efficiency and maintain quality, CIA sought a solution that could streamline their workflow without compromising the accuracy and detail in their reports.\n\n“We are part of a consortium of 12 private practices, an MSO called Unified Radiology, and we heard very positive word of mouth feedback on the value of Rad AI from our sister practices.”\n\n-Kevin Woolley, MD, FACR, CIA Radiologist\n\nThe Solution\n\nColorado Imaging Associates has always sought to stay at the forefront of industry advancements. True to these roots, they turned to technology to help them grapple with the challenges of increasing exam volumes. The partnership with Rad AI came about as they sought to improve their service quality and efficiency.\n\n“We were impressed by the demonstrations Rad AI provided and the management team's adaptiveness in working with us, as well as the cost efficiency of using Rad AI.”\n\n-Sachin Talusani, MD, CIA President\n\nColorado Imaging Associates harnessed the power of Rad AI Impressions to revolutionize their report generation process. Rad AI Impressions uses generative AI to automate the creation of accurate and comprehensive impressions in radiology reports. CIA had been seeking technological solutions to manage high exam volumes and reduce radiologist stress. Rad AI's partnership with CIA began in July 2023, and the implementation of Rad AI Impressions began a new chapter in CIA's operational excellence.\n\nImpact Analysis\n\nBy analyzing data from 21 radiologists for their pre and post-implementation periods, Rad AI was able to quantify the significant impact of Rad AI Impressions. The results were striking: an 80% reduction in the number of words dictated per impression and a 30% reduction in the time spent on impressions overall.\n\n80% Fewer Words Dictated Per Impression\n\nOne of the most significant benefits CIA experienced with Rad AI Impressions was a drastic reduction in the number of words radiologists needed to dictate. On average, the number of dictated words per impression decreased by 80%.\n\nThis reduction has numerous benefits. Dr. Woolley, a CIA radiologist, emphasized that not having to talk as much was the most important advantage for him personally. Dictating fewer words leads to reduced vocal strain and fatigue over the course of a shift. It also contributes to lower stress and burnout.\n\n“Much of the mental stress from the work that I do is related to vocalizing something that you have in your head, and the only way to get it into a report form is to say it, which slows the radiologist down and requires more mental energy. Personally, I feel that Rad AI takes care of about 99% of that work.”\n\n-Kevin Woolley, MD, FACR, CIA Radiologist\n\n30% Less Time Spent on Impressions\n\nIn addition to fewer dictated words, Rad AI Impressions led to a 30% reduction in the overall time CIA's radiologists spent on impressions. Before Rad AI Impression, radiologists spent an average of 30 seconds per impression. After Rad AI Impressions, this decreased to just 21 seconds.\n\nRad AI Impressions achieves these time savings by using AI to automatically generate impressions based on the radiologist's dictated findings. This eliminates several manual steps that can be time-consuming, such as reviewing findings or other notes, rechecking images, and dictating impressions, saving precious seconds on each report. Rad AI Impressions completes the automated impression in just 1 to 3 seconds. These efficiency gains can have a major impact on revenue and the ability to handle rising scan volumes.\n\n“Rad AI removes the added mental and physical work of saying what I normally say, doing it extremely accurately, and allowing me to do 5-10% more work with the same mental energy.”\n\n-Kevin Woolley, MD, FACR, CIA Radiologist\n\nAdditional Benefits: Improved Accuracy and Reduced Burnout\n\nBeyond efficiency gains, CIA discovered additional benefits to using Rad AI Impressions, including improved report accuracy and reduced burnout.\n\n\"An unexpected aspect of using Rad AI Rad AI Impressions was the improvement in the quality of our reports. We found that misstatements in the findings were duplicated in the impression, and that afforded us an opportunity to go back and correct those discrepancies.\"\n\n-Sachin Talusani, MD, CIA President\n\nMoreover, the efficiency gains and reduction in repetitive dictation contribute to lower stress and burnout among radiologists. Dr. Woolley noted the cognitive breaks between reports, enabled by Rad AI Impressions, are very apparent and helpful over the course of a shift.\n\n“With that 5-10% increase in productivity, I feel palpably less tired and burned out at the end of a workday doing 5-10% more. I haven’t experienced anything in my career since voice recognition with a similar impact. It really makes my days much better and makes me ready to do more work, leaving me less tired when I start work the next day.”\n\n-Kevin Woolley, MD, FACR, CIA Radiologist\n\nSummary and Key Takeaways\n\nColorado Imaging Associates' experience with Rad AI Impressions demonstrates the significant impact generative AI can have in radiology. With an 80% reduction in dictated words per impression and a 30% reduction in time spent on impressions, CIA's radiologists are working more efficiently while maintaining high report accuracy.\n\n80% reduction in impression words dictated per report (from 67 to 15 words per impression)\n\n30% reduction in overall time spent on impressions (from 30 to 21 seconds per report on average)\n\n40% reduction in MRI impression times (from 50 to 29 seconds on average)\n\n30% reduction in CT impression times (from 52 to 37 seconds on average)\n\n20% reduction in Ultrasound and CR impression times",

      "# [Rapidly Growing Radiology AI Company, Rad AI, Strikes Partnership With Google Cloud by Dr. Sai Balasubramanian, M.D., J.D, Dr. Sai Balasubramanian, M.D, J.D on 2024-01-16](https://www.forbes.com/sites/saibala/2024/01/16/rapidly-growing-radiology-ai-company-rad-ai-strikes-partnership-with-google-cloud/)\nOne of the most rapidly growing startups at the intersections of technology, artificial intelligence and radiology, Rad AI, announced today that it will be partnering with Google Cloud in scaling its efforts to improve clinical radiologists’ workflows and mitigate burnout. The company has numerous offerings and is perhaps most well-known for its Reporting and Omni Impressions platforms, both of which have been developed as a means to augment clinician productivity. For example, Rad AI Omni Impressions automatically generates report impressions once the raw findings have been dictated by the radiologist. The key differentiator of this technology is that the platform continuously learns from each user and generates a personalized output that is in the stylistic tone and literary voice of each individual radiologist.\n\nThe company’s partnership with Google Cloud will provide an opportunity to scale its technology by leveraging Google’s platform, MedLM foundation models and its cloud services. MedLM, a family of foundation models fine-tuned for healthcare applications, will especially help unlock a significant amount of potential for the company by increasing the accuracy of reports, improving stylistic customizations and contributing to workflow optimization.\n\nThough Rad AI is relatively young, it has seen significant investment and interest; its Series A funding round alone involved nearly $25 million, and the company is now working with nearly 30% of the radiology services market in the United States.\n\nDoktor Gurson, Co-founder and CEO of Rad AI, enthusiastically explains that the company has been built by radiologists for radiologists with a few ambitious goals: reduce radiologist burnout, improve clinical workflows and ultimately, make a positive impact on clinical care delivery. He also explains that the partnership with Google Cloud is an important step forward for the company in its growth journey: “Rad AI brings the domain expertise in radiology, and Google Cloud’s MedLM now gives us the opportunity to level up and push further.”\n\nAashima Gupta, Global Director, Healthcare Strategy and Solutions at Google Cloud, explains that there is significant opportunity in the field of radiology to leverage artificial intelligence technology and generate content for the purposes of ultimately improving the care delivery process: “as the amount of medical imaging grows, we can equip radiologists with more robust platforms and technologies to make their workflows more efficient and accurate.”\n\nGupta alludes to an important aspect about the field of radiology; a key study in the European Journal of Radiology found that there has been a significant overall increase in the use of radiological imaging and corresponding workload for radiologists over the past 16 years. Another study published in Academic Radiology took a deep dive into causative factors for burnout in radiologists and found numerous systemic and workflow factors leading to increasing levels of attrition.\n\nBut the healthcare ecosystem cannot afford to lose radiologists due to burnout, given just how essential this function is for patient care. This is why companies are heavily investing with an unprecedented focus on radiology, hoping to leverage the latest in artificial intelligence technology. Notably, scientists and leaders are approaching this phenomenon cautiously: extensive studies are being conducted and funded to measure the efficacy of AI in radiology and its levels of accuracy. Regarding this factor, Gurson emphasizes that even with technologies such as Rad AI, it will ultimately be important for a human radiologist to review the outputs and provide the final sign-off, keeping the “human in the loop.”\n\nNevertheless, these are just early days for the intersection of artificial intelligence and radiology. Undoubtedly, the scale and speed at which this technology is growing indicates that there is still a lot of work to be done; however, if executed correctly, there is significant promise to potentially create positive impact.",

      "# [Rad AI, a startup that helps radiologists save time on report generation, raises $50M Series B from Khosla Ventures by Marina Temkin on 2024-05-07](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/07/rad-ai-a-startup-that-helps-radiologists-save-time-on-report-generation-raises-50m-series-b-from-khosla-ventures/)\nIn 2017, Vinod Khosla told CNBC that the job “of the radiologist will be obsolete in five years.” While the founder of Khosla Ventures later revised that timeline to as long as 15 years, he maintained that AI image recognition could soon diagnose disease on scans better than human doctors.\n\nSeven years later, radiologists are still required to interpret most scans (even if AI software helps them); the more immediate challenge is the shortage of these doctors in the United States and around the world.\n\nWhile Khosla Ventures has backed several imaging startups, including Vista.ai and Q Bio, the firm’s latest bet is on a company that makes radiologists’ workload easier by reducing the time spent on report documentation, instead of trying to replace the physician with a machine.\n\nOn Tuesday, Khosla led a $50 million Series B into Rad AI, which developed a tool that can generate reports for radiologists. Other participants in the round included World Innovation Lab and returning investors ARTIS Ventures, OCV Partners, Kickstart Fund and Gradient Ventures (Google’s AI-focused fund). The financing brought the company’s total capital raised to over $80 million.\n\nRad AI was founded in 2018 by Dr. Jeff Chang, who completed his medical training as a radiologist when he was 16 and later received an MBA from UCLA, and serial entrepreneur Doktor Gurson.\n\nSince Chang knew from his own experience as a practicing doctor that the majority of radiologists’ time is spent documenting findings rather than analyzing images, the pair decided to develop a proprietary LLM trained on radiology report datasets for automating doctors’ findings and impressions documentation.\n\nWhile tech companies didn’t widely use generative AI until OpenAI’s ChatGPT burst onto the scene in 2022, Rad AI takes pride in being an early adopter of this technology. “I’m confident we’re the first company in radiology to start using LLMs,” Gurson, Rad AI’s CEO told TechCrunch. “We started doing that work in 2018, around the same time that open AI was creating their [first] models.”\n\nSix years later, Rad AI’s products are used by about a third of U.S. health systems and nine of the 10 largest radiology groups in the country, Gurson said.\n\nThe fresh capital will be used to build a team that deploys Rad AI’s latest product: a standalone radiology reporting solution.\n\n“We have a lot of interest, but there’s only so much we can deploy at once,” Gurson said, adding that Rad AI is hiring people who can install and maintain the software.\n\nSome incumbents have been trying to add GenAI functionality to their radiology reporting software over the past 18 months, but Rad AI doesn’t consider these companies to be true competitors yet.\n\n“At this point, probably 99% to 100% of the market uses our products,” he said. “If it’s any indication, we’ve not lost a single customer since we started.”",

The integration of AI in radiology holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare practices by advancing diagnosis, quantification, and management of multiple medical conditions. Nevertheless, the ever-growing availability of AI tools in radiology highlights an increasing need to critically evaluate claims for its utility and to differentiate safe product offerings from potentially harmful, or fundamentally unhelpful ones. This multi-society paper, presenting the views of Radiology Societies in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, defines the potential practical problems and ethical issues surrounding the incorporation of AI into radiological practice. In addition to delineating the main points of concern that developers, regulators, and purchasers of AI tools should consider prior to their introduction into clinical practice, this statement also suggests methods to monitor their stability and safety in clinical use, and their suitability for possible autonomous function. This statement is intended to serve as a useful summary of the practical issues which should be considered by all parties involved in the development of radiology AI resources, and their implementation as clinical tools.\n\nThis article is simultaneously published in Insights into Imaging (DOI https://doi.org/10.1186/s13244-023-01541-3), Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Oncology (DOI https://doi.org/10.1111/1754-9485.13612), Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal (DOI https://doi.org/10.1177/08465371231222229), Journal of the American College of Radiology (DOI https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2023.12.005), and Radiology: Artificial Intelligence (DOI https://doi.org/10.1148/ryai.230513).\n\nKeywords: Artificial Intelligence, Radiology, Automation, Machine Learning\n\nPublished under a CC BY 4.0 license. ©The Author(s) 2024.\n\nEditor’s Note: The RSNA Board of Directors has endorsed this article.

Previous new technologies disrupted practice by introducing new capabilities, with greater capacity to identify disease and differentiate tissues. These functioned as natural extensions of already-existing ways of doing things; older, less-effective techniques were supplanted, replaced by new modalities with greater effectiveness. All of these changes took place within the same milieu of human radiologists utilising the available tools for the benefit of patients. The tools changed, the work-patterns remained fundamentally similar.\n\nArtificial intelligence offers the possibility of change that goes far beyond previous disruptions. Its champions have sometimes suggested that AI can replace radiologists entirely (1), although some have subsequently revised their views and come to see dangers in uncontrolled AI development (2). More realistically, AI is increasingly being researched as a potential adjunct to radiologist-led interpretation of imaging (3). Research is also being directed towards AI replacing traditional roles of radiologists, including study and protocol selection (4), and direct generation of radiology reports by AI models (5).\n\nIn the midst of the burgeoning literature, publicity and claims surrounding AI in radiology, how is a radiologist, practice manager or software purchaser to winnow the wheat from the chaff, to critically evaluate claims of utility and benefit from AI utilisation, to differentiate fully-evaluated and safe product offerings from those with potential to function other than as advertised, or, worse, to do harm? In this multi-society paper, representatives of the American College of Radiology (ACR), Canadian Association of Radiologists (CAR), European Society of Radiology (ESR), Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR), and Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) attempt to define the specific potential problems around AI incorporation into radiological practice, the relevant ethical issues that arise, the considerations that should be borne in mind by developers of AI tools, the issues that should be considered by those authorised to license or certify AI tools for clinical use, how AI tools should be evaluated by purchasers and users when considering their introduction into clinical practice, how they should be monitored for long-term stability and safety, and how we should evaluate their suitability for autonomous function.\n\nSection 2: What is the problem?\n\nA. Why do AI algorithms differ from previous IT/informatics developments in radiology?\n\nTraditional computer-aided detection (CADe) or diagnosis (CADx) systems as used in radiology for about 30 years are rule-based, using classical machine learning techniques with handcrafted features. The features the system was intended to detect, such as shape, size or texture of a lesion, were manually pre-defined, and then used to detect abnormalities in radiological images (6). Although useful, CAD was limited by the need for manual feature engineering and the inability to learn and adapt over time.\n\nModern AI algorithms, particularly those based on deep learning, fundamentally differ from traditional CAD by automatically learning relevant features from data without explicit definition and programming. Deep learning algorithms can learn to identify patterns in radiological images by being trained on large datasets and, in principle, can continuously learn and improve their performance as they are exposed to more data (7). Training of deep learning models can use either supervised learning (most used today, presenting pairs of inputs and desired outputs), unsupervised learning (the system clusters the data in classes), or reinforcement learning (the system learns by being rewarded or punished) (8).\n\nAnother key difference is the level of automation that AI algorithms can bring to radiology. While traditional CAD systems can assist in the detection of abnormalities, AI algorithms have the potential to automate many routine radiology tasks, such as image segmentation and measurement, image quality and completeness evaluation, and can provide decision support by analyzing a vast amount of data in real time (9, 10).\n\nThe implementation of AI in radiology presents new challenges, such as the need for large annotated datasets for training AI algorithms, ensuring the transparency and interpretability of AI decisions, and addressing ethical and regulatory considerations (11, 12).\n\nB. Why do we need to evaluate AI models in new ways before they enter routine clinical use?\n\nMost AI models in Radiology are used to support lesion detection or quantification, or to help radiologists’ decision making (13). Some newer approaches also help with analysing patients’ history or with writing reports and/or impressions of examinations (14). To ensure safe operation of AI models in Radiology, it is essential to educate radiologists and other potential end-users about the principles of AI and teach them the limits and potential risks when using AI models (15, 16).\n\nIt is also important to evaluate the accuracy of AI models on the target population before introducing them into clinical practice, and after that introduction, their performance should be monitored to detect drifts in accuracy.\n\nThe integration of AI algorithms into the radiology workflow is key to ensure their safe and consistent operation. The lack of widely accepted standards for AI integration is still a challenge (17). In this context, attention should be paid to the interface design. Exposing radiologists to an increasing number of complex interfaces is undesirable, and is liable to diminish utility and acceptance of AI tools (18).\n\nC. How can we differentiate among the multiplicity of products on offer?\n\nThe integration of AI in radiology has the potential to revolutionize healthcare practices, offering advanced solutions to diagnose, quantify, and manage multiple medical conditions. However, the evaluation of AI models extends beyond clinical accuracy, encompassing business and technical considerations. These, and other aspects of how potential users and purchasers can evaluate AI tools before implementation, are explored in detail in Section 6.\n\nSection 3: What are the ethical issues?\n\nMedical ethics is underpinned by four underlying principles:\n\nBeneficence (doing good)\n\nNon-maleficence (doing no harm)\n\nAutonomy (patient freedom to choose)\n\nJustice (ensuring fairness) (19–22).\n\nThese principles apply to medical practice in the broadest sense and therefore encompass ethical deliberations pertinent to AI in radiology. This section draws upon work by multiple stakeholders that include the AAPM, ACR, CAR, ESR, EuSoMII, RANZCR, RSNA, and SIIM (11, 23–28) and considers ethical issues that arise in the context of development, deployment, use and monitoring of AI systems.\n\nIn 2019, the majority of the above societies collaborated on a multisociety statement on Ethics of AI in Radiology (23), delivering the following key messages:\n\n■ AI in radiology should promote well-being, minimize harm, and ensure that the benefits and harms are distributed among stakeholders in a just manner.\n\n■ AI should respect human rights and freedoms, including dignity and privacy. It should be designed for maximum transparency and dependability.\n\n■ Ultimate responsibility and accountability for AI remains with its human designers and operators.\n\n■ The radiology community should develop codes of ethics and practice for AI that promote any use that helps patients and the common good, and block use of radiology data and algorithms for financial gain without those two attributes.\n\n■ There is a need for extensive research to understand how to best deploy AI in clinical practice.\n\n■ AI carries potential pitfalls and inherent biases. Widespread use of AI-based intelligent and autonomous systems in radiology can increase the risk of systemic errors with high consequence, and highlights complex ethical and societal issues.\n\nKey statement\n\nAI in radiology should promote well-being, minimize harm, respect human rights such as dignity and privacy, and ensure that benefits and harms are distributed among stakeholders in a just manner.\n\nGiven the critical dependency of AI upon data, ethical issues relating to acquisition, use, storage and disposal of data are central to patient safety and the appropriate use of AI. Important ethical issues relate to consent, privacy and data protection, data ownership, bias and fairness, transparency and integration of AI into clinical practice (11, 23).\n\nPrivacy, consent and data ownership— AI systems in radiology require access to large amounts of patient data for training and operation. Ensuring that this data is used ethically involves maintaining patient privacy, obtaining informed consent for data use, and ensuring data security. Multiple factors impinging upon ownership of patient data include relevant legislation, patient privacy and autonomy, broader public interest, health care provider and AI developer interests, and copyright issues (23, 24). Inevitably, different countries vary with regard to these influences and this may make use of data by developers and others even more complex. In principle, decisions regarding the extent of patient consent required (‘informed’, ‘opt-out’ or ‘presumed’) reflect the balance between potential societal benefit or beneficence and patient autonomy. The anonymity of patient data is also an important but complex consideration and, if not maintained, is another source of risk. Potential harms, such as discrimination, insurance costs and humiliation, must be considered when data-related decisions are made.\n\nBias and fairness— AI systems can unintentionally perpetuate or even amplify existing biases in healthcare, leading to unfair outcomes (Table 1). In particular, AI systems rely on training data, lack context and are more likely to exhibit bias if the data used to train the AI system are not representative of the patient population on which the AI system will be used. This bias is due to differences in populations, and may reflect gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, social, environmental, or economic factors. The data utilised may also contain inherent biases for other reasons, such as bias derived from the humans who label data for training the AI system. Different scanning devices and protocols may also influence the data used during AI development and induce bias.\n\nTable 1:\n\nThe interaction between AI systems and humans is also germane. Humans have an appreciation of context and are more likely to understand if AI outputs are inappropriate in a given clinical context and act rather than simply accepting incorrect AI advice. In contradistinction, automation bias is the tendency of humans to favor the decisions of AI systems over human decisions, which can lead to errors if the AI system is incorrect. This automation bias may be accentuated when a radiologist is fatigued or there is a limited radiology workforce and therefore limited capacity to supervise AI output. Risks to patient safety will also be higher when autonomous AI systems are implemented or the AI system continues to learn and adapt over time. In these situations, the need for assessment and monitoring of AI system performance becomes commensurately greater.\n\nKey statement\n\nAI systems rely on training data, lack context and are more likely to exhibit bias if the data used to train the AI system are not representative of the patient population on which the AI system is used.\n\nTransparency and explainability— Transparency requires provision of clear information about an AI system’s capabilities and limitations, in particular the purpose for which the systems are intended, the conditions under which they can be expected to function as intended and the expected level of accuracy in achieving the specified purpose. This information is important especially for deployers of the systems, but it may also be relevant to competent authorities and affected parties (29). The concept of transparency should also extend to patients being made aware if AI systems are being used.\n\nMany deep learning AI systems work as “black boxes”, and in this setting radiologists and other healthcare providers may have little or no insight into how the AI algorithm arrived at its conclusions. Although difficult to achieve with some deep learning systems, provision of information about how decisions are made results in greater comprehensibility and trust amongst patients and medical professionals. Definitions vary, but transparency, interpretability (the ability to understand the workings of an AI system) and explainability (how an AI system makes decisions and presents its output in detail) are desirable, but come with risks. Opinions differ, but the need for transparency, interpretability and explainability should be balanced against potential harm relating to loss of privacy, loss of proprietary information and malicious attacks.\n\nAI in clinical practice— Access to data, various skills and computing power is vital during development and deployment of AI systems. These resources are not evenly available, leading to potential inequity of access to benefits from AI, resulting from multiple factors that include geographic location, ethnicity and availability of financial resources. For example, resource-rich countries or hospitals may have access to more advanced AI tools than their resource-poor counterparts, thus exacerbating health disparities.\n\nThe introduction of AI into healthcare could alter the dynamic between physicians and patients, with potential implications for patient trust. Historically, clinicians are held responsible when an acceptable standard of care is not met. Where an AI system is used and the standard of care is not met, accountability and liability may extend to the developer and to the healthcare entity that implemented the AI system in addition to the clinician (11, 23).\n\nConflicts of interest may also arise where radiologists, other healthcare professionals or healthcare systems are engaged by or otherwise involved with commercial entities marketing AI systems (28). In order to achieve optimal performance and patient safety, consideration must be given to successful integration of AI systems into workflow and with other technology, and education of those using such systems. Done right, AI implementation stands to benefit the patients & public, and radiologists are well advised to stay relevant by leveraging their professional skills to promote safe and effective AI deployment (11, 23).\n\nKey statement\n\nAddressing ethical issues in AI will require a combination of technical solutions, government activity, regulatory oversight, and ethical guidelines developed in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, including clinicians, patients, AI developers, and ethicists.\n\nSection 4: What should developers consider when creating a new AI tool for radiology?\n\nA. Clinical utility of new products\n\nNew products should improve the quality or efficiency of existing workflows in terms of lesion detection, segmentation, diagnosis, or prediction of clinical outcomes. A common mistake among radiology AI developers is the development of solutions reflective of available technology and datasets, rather than those with clinical utility supporting existing workflows. Society-developed resources, such as the ACR DSI Define-AI directory, often serve as a good starting place to ensure the technology being developed meets genuine clinical needs (30). In the absence of an existing Use Case reference, or an application that is not a direct derivative evolution of an existing application, developers should involve clinicians as early as possible in the design and development process to gain insights into the feasibility and practicality of proposals, well before substantial investments in time and developer resources have been made.\n\nKey statement— New products should target unmet clinical needs rather than focus on existing technology and datasets.\n\nB. Superiority to existing clinical/radiology tools\n\nDemonstrating superiority over existing clinical processes can be a challenging proposition for developers, particularly those with limited clinical experience in the domain. For solutions backed by pre-existing open-science competitions, where clear performance metrics are defined and leaderboards of competition entrants are maintained, it is generally easier to demonstrate competitive equivalence or superiority. This is particularly notable in the long series of AI Challenges at annual RSNA and MICCAI conferences (31, 32). In situations where no such open data exist, developers should determine the baseline clinical performance, and compare the AI performance with existing or approved software, or radiologist multi-reader control data. Well-designed multi-reader diagnostic accuracy studies are a common method of reporting AI solution superiority, though they can be both difficult and expensive to perform effectively. When human readers are assisted by AI, different modes of algorithm use, such as first-reader, concurrent reader, second-reader, or triage modes, may affect how relative performance is analyzed (33).\n\nC. Radiomics, explainability & transparency\n\nThere are certain classes of AI applications that pose particular challenges to model interpretability. Radiomics refers to the extraction of a large number of features from medical images using data-characterisation algorithms to describe pixel intensities, relationships between these pixels, shapes, and textures. Many of these features are non-intuitive or do not map easily to subjective or clinical image findings (34). There has been much comment about the black box nature of AI models, with early efforts focused on heat map and saliency visualizations; some researchers have called for a combination of visualizations and generated text to improve interpretability of diagnoses (35–37). Lessons learnt from traditional biomedical research are extremely relevant, and in situations where model transparency and explainability are poor, a higher standard of empirical evidence of performance may be required, including external or multi-centre test data to prove model generalizability, and prospective real-world evaluation, used in clinical settings that most resemble the clinical setting in which the product is most likely to be deployed.\n\nSection 5: What information should regulators request from developers prior to approval of AI software for clinical use?\n\nKey statement\n\nPrior to approval, regulators should request information from AI software developers pertaining to the company, clinical use, implementation, product development, demonstration, cost, and publications (Table 2).\n\nTable 2:\n\nAI solutions generally present estimates of solution performance using a combination of retrospective and prospective validation trial results upon which their statements of function are based.\n\nRegulators should pay close attention to ensure that the reported information complies with the highest standards of practice; studies should ideally adhere to criteria defined by the multiple established scientific reporting standards (39–43). Lower quality evidence often has significant gaps in the information reported and only partially fulfills these standard criteria. Two common errors in solution performance reporting include a failure to report a range of expected performance—lower quality solutions often report a single summary accuracy figure—and not reporting specific failure conditions and errors, with lower quality solutions selectively highlighting the best diagnoses made by their systems. In the broader AI safety community, there is a strong embrace of Model Cards or System Cards, in which in-depth analyses of limitations, errors, and biases are explicitly reported, often entirely separate from the primary report of system performance (44, 45). This level of public transparency should be strongly encouraged by regulators to foster a greater culture of AI safety, and should be a primary consideration when evaluating the quality of submissions.\n\nAlthough clinical risk models differ based upon geographic jurisdiction and historical precedents, we strongly believe that any regulatory model should draw clear categories and boundaries between advisory, semi-automated, and automated systems, with a deeper evidence base and real-world track record required for greater degrees of autonomy. Clinical references often cite, as a relatable metaphor, automation scales that have been proposed for autonomous driving vehicles, for example the SAE J3016 Levels of Driving Automation (46). Multiple attempts to design analogous levels of escalating automation for radiology workflow have been proposed (24, 47). Traditional regulatory frameworks governing medical devices have focused predominantly on monitoring or therapeutic devices, which have very rarely, up until recently, exhibited any functionality with the potential of autonomous action. The general AI literature is replete with examples of negative and often unexpected harms of AI making unsupervised decisions (48). The patient implications of decision making required in clinical medical imaging, even declarations of stability or normality, often have dramatic direct implications on patient care, which we suspect will require human co-supervision for some time.\n\nRegulators should be particularly attuned to ensuring that solutions have an explicit post-market quality assurance plan. The importance of this has several aspects, but mainly relates to the issues caused by concept drift, due to changes in the patient population or occasionally even differences due to upgrades of successive new versions of AI software (49). In practice, what this may entail is prospective performance monitoring of the AI model, for example monitoring for major deviations in month-to-month diagnostic event frequencies, with alerts raised when normal bounds are exceeded, or a control sample approach where a constant reserved held-out set of test case examples is routinely evaluated with the algorithm, to ensure no major deviations on known difficult or borderline cases (50). At a very minimum, a clear reporting procedure for unexpected errors to the vendor, with named responsible contact personnel, should be established and made easily accessible to clinical end users.\n\nSection 6: What should purchasers of AI tools consider when contemplating introduction of AI tools into practice?\n\nWhen contemplating the implementation of AI applications in clinical practice, various key aspects should be considered to ensure sustainable benefits to all stake-holders involved. As described in the previous section, regulatory approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or equivalent agencies certifies that medical devices (including AI tools) comply with the relevant regulations and have gone through a conformity assessment based on the device’s risk category. However, this certification alone does not necessarily guarantee successful implementation into clinical workflow (51). Among other things it is therefore crucial that potential purchasers consider the following aspects:\n\nWhat is the intended use of the AI, who will most benefit from its use, which risks are associated with its use and what is the potential economic impact?\n\nHow will the AI tool be integrated into the institutions’ workflows and how can the commercial claims be verified and monitored?\n\nHow do users need to be trained and which psychological effects need to be considered with regard to human-AI-interaction?\n\nIs the FDA (or other agency) approval/clearance data reflective of accuracy on local data? Is that accuracy on local data sufficient for use in that institution and will users accept and hence engage with the AI results?\n\nUsage benefits, risks and cost\n\nFor any AI tool to be successfully integrated into clinical practice, stakeholders should first clearly identify areas that need improvement and define relevant key performance indicators (52, 53). The integration of an AI tool may then be part of a larger strategy devised to attain the goal set for the institution. Alternatively, it might also be the case that a particular AI tool proposed by a vendor offers a potential to improve the quality of the institutions’ services in an area not previously considered. In either case, as outlined in Section 4A, it is essential to determine whether or not the tool solves a real, specific problem that the institution has; tools are solutions, and a solution to a non-existent problem has no value. Note also that different institutions have different problems; a tool that is valuable for one group may not have value for another.\n\nFor the positive impact of an AI tool to be measurable, objective and quantifiable goals should be set. It may be useful to consider both what proportion of cases or patients an AI tool is expected to impact, and what the magnitude of impact on each case or patient is expected to be. Purchasers should be aware that the beneficiary of the AI tools’ potential for improvement does not always need to be the radiologist or the radiology department alone. Ideally, all stakeholders involved, from the patient requiring a service to the respective institution and even the wider society could benefit from AI being successfully implemented in a clinical workflow. An example of a strong use-case could be AI as a supporting tool in high-volume radiological screening settings (e.g. mammography). In this case the benefits for patients could include earlier and better detection of breast cancer, leading to better overall outcomes, while benefits for radiologists could include increased productivity, the availability of an additional “safety net” or the potential to increase the time available for interaction with the patient (54). Apart from improvements in productivity and service quality positively reflecting on the institution, they could potentially help reduce costs, while for the wider society positive effects on overall healthcare costs and population health could be envisioned. Such effects could also be expected for other commonly suggested use-cases, such as the detection of large vessel occlusions or in other time-sensitive situations. However, for other applications like organizational AI support tools or as-of-yet more research-driven applications (such as AI-powered opportunistic screening) the benefits might not be as easily definable (55, 56). Depending on the local circumstances and healthcare system in place, such potential benefits need to be carefully weighed against their immediate and mid- or long-term economic impact. Return on investment (RoI) and cost–benefit analyses should be planned and carried out to ensure the viability of the planned AI integration. Depending on the healthcare system, establishment of a viable payment mechanism for AI use may be critical. AI models that primarily benefit a fee-for-service hospital or outpatient imaging center prove RoI through decreasing length of stay (57), improving throughput in the emergency department (58), increasing the volume of findings that require follow-up and/or treatment, decreasing the length of time it takes to perform an imaging exam, and improving operations in the radiology department. Other potential benefits to the radiology practice include decreased mental fatigue, improved radiologist recruitment and retention, and decreased medical malpractice liability, although these tend to be additive as they do not generally cover the cost of the AI.\n\nLastly, potential costs (both capital and recurrent) and risks associated with the implementation and usage of an AI system are essential components of any purchase analysis and decision. In part, risk assessment can be facilitated by consulting the risk matrix and the risk–benefit analysis provided in the regulatory files by vendors. However, some risks may not be addressed in such regulatory filings or only become apparent during use. The most obvious component of cost is the licensing costs paid to the vendor, but these are typically only a small part of the total cost of ownership. Other sources of cost include contracting and legal agreements, IT effort and professional services for integration with existing systems, training for users and administrators, infrastructure for running the AI, and on-going maintenance and monitoring.\n\nOther essential factors in making an informed decision include evaluating the vendor’s compatibility as a reliable partner, the vendor’s staying power in a competitive environment with limited payor reimbursement (even more important in this era of AI vendor consolidation), optimized model pricing, and opportunities for collaboration beyond product purchase, such as co-development and product resale.\n\nA key component of risk is understanding what the performance characteristics of the algorithm are likely to be in the environment in which it will be used. The error rate in use may differ substantially from what was reported in testing, particularly when the characteristics or distributions of the input data (e.g. scanner manufacturers, scan protocols, patient demograph-ics, disease prevalence, comorbidities) differ from the test data. Ideally, each site considering implementation would perform a statistically rigorous evaluation of performance on their own local data (a method for this evaluation is presented in the Clinical Evaluation Section below). In practice, this may not be feasible. At a minimum, the characteristics of local data should be compared with those of the test data (a typical example might be where a model has been tested only on one manufacturer’s MRI scanner, but will be used on a scanner made by a different manufacturer). Where these are similar, the reported performance metrics may be relied upon with some confidence; where they are not (e.g., an algorithm tested only on adults being considered for off-label use in a pediatric hospital) one should proceed with great caution, if at all. Error frequency, conceptually the inverse of performance, is not the final word on risk, because different errors pose different risks. One should consider the detectability of the errors that are anticipated. That is, for each error, what is the probability that people in the workflow will notice that the AI has produced an erroneous output? For each detected error, what is the probability that the error will be corrected? Finally, if an error is not detected or not corrected, what is the expected impact on patients or other stakeholders? The consideration together of error frequency, detectability, correctability and impact provides a framework for assessing the direct risk of algorithmic errors. Ongoing monitoring of these risks is considered in Section 7.\n\nAnother key component of risk is the impact of an AI tool on radiologist performance. Relying on an automated tool to perform a task may lead to de-skilling of radiologists for the task the tool has taken on. This risk is particularly problematic if the radiologist is expected to perform the task manually when the tool fails, but may no longer be skilled enough to do so adequately. User over-reliance and under-reliance also decrease the accuracy of the combined output of the radiologist in combination with the AI model and is discussed further in Section 8.\n\nA final aspect of risk that must be considered is the potential for AI to create or exacerbate healthcare disparities. AI is particularly prone to this because it is generally trained on retrospective data drawn from clinical archives, and these data represent the current and historical healthcare disparities and inequities of our society. Training an AI is a mathematical process of minimizing a cost function that proceeds without ethics or morals. Therefore AI may learn from the inequities and disparities embedded in the training data, and can perpetuate these in implementation. There is no easy or straightforward process for comprehensively identifying these biases, but it is incumbent upon us as physicians and data scientists to think about, search for and mitigate these biases; if these questions are unasked, they will most certainly remain unanswered.\n\nIntegration, verification and monitoring\n\nOnce expected benefits and goals have been decided upon, cost–benefit analysis has been carried out and potential risks have been assessed, integration of the selected AI tools can be planned. Depending on the local IT infrastructure and policies, purchasers can consider different technical integrations—either as local installations with dedicated computational resources on site or as a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) model. In both types of installation, data orchestration of DICOM and HL7 play a vital role ensuring the right slices from the correct series of the relevant study for the right patient in the right setting are sent to the appropriate AI in an optimized time. To achieve a robust orchestration, understanding and structuring the content of your data is essential. Unfortunately, relying on DICOM metadata is often insufficient due to the high variability and labile nature of study and series names, and the fact that DICOM headers may be incomplete. A more robust option is to use imaging AI to determine the data contents at the studies and series level and use that output for orchestration. Using computer vision AI to determine which body parts are on each image and if intravenous contrast has been administrated are two of the most useful additions. Downstream data orchestration from the AI system requires an intelligent system able to facilitate different workflows depending on an understanding of the AI results. Most current implementations only send the AI results to the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). This limited integration not only allows visualization of AI results by referring physicians, which may not be optimal if these physicians haven’t been educated about the details and accuracy of the AI model, but also has been shown to increase automation bias among radiologists (59). Furthermore, PACS currently offers limited modes for AI results integration and in most instances, the radiologist cannot modify the AI results in PACS. To optimize AI results management and integration, a PACS should enable the radiologist to interact with and modify the AI results and, if results are changed, empower the AI to immediately reprocess a new output. In addition, the updated AI result should be provided to the AI vendor so it can be used for future model improvement. This type of interaction is facilitated in a cloud-native environment where both the PACS and AI models can share radiology data and AI results. Additionally, the ability to accept and store AI results along with radiologist feedback, optimize data security, and continuously monitor AI accuracy are crucial technical aspects that are facilitated in cloud-native systems.\n\nWhatever the integration, ideally AI tools should be well integrated into the usual clinical workflow and information systems in order to avoid additional workload by requiring users to switch between applications. A recently published survey revealed concerns about additional workload to be one of the main reasons for respondents not intending to acquire AI tools for their clinical practice (60). The same survey found that another major concern was that the AI system would not perform as well as advertised. This concern is important and should not be overlooked. Of course, vendors will have performed testing and quality assurance of the respective AI tools during regulatory approval, but purchasers should consider validation of the AI’s performance on a local dataset, and adjust parameters if needed prior to implementation in clinical practice. This process should be repeated whenever relevant changes are made to the AI software or the equipment used in combination with the AI. In the example of a commercially available breast screening AI model an update of the AI tool resulted in a substantially different recall rate, requiring recalibration of the decision threshold to ensure continued usage with clinically acceptable diagnostic accuracy (61). These findings highlight that it cannot be taken for granted that diagnostic performance claimed in premarket publications translates to a comparable and stable performance during clinical usage, emphasising the need for continuous post-market surveillance of the AI systems used. The exact approaches to how this should be done are currently being discussed by the respective regulatory bodies. For example, the UK’s Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Guidance for manufacturers on reporting adverse incidents involving Software as a Medical Device under the vigilance system details various circumstances in which an adverse event should be reported—including “(failure) to identify clinically relevant brain image findings related to acute stroke” and “(degradation of MRI image) appearance of anatomical and pathological structures” (62). Similarly, the FDA’s Proposed Regulatory Framework for Modifications to Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device would expect manufacturers “to commit to the principles of transparency and real-world performance monitoring” when making updates to their products (63). Stakeholders in implementation of AI tools in clinical practice should therefore familiarize themselves with the relevant methods and metrics for clinical evaluation and devise strategies to verify performance claims prior to tool introduction, and should continuously monitor performance during routine usage (64). This is especially important as the previously mentioned survey found that a large majority of respondents did not assess the AI’s diagnostic accuracy on a regular basis (60) Post-market monitoring is discussed in greater detail in Section 7 (below).\n\nHuman-AI interaction\n\nBesides technical performance details and the practical workflow integration of AI tools in radiology, the importance of difficult-to-measure human factors should not be underestimated. AI has undeniably made impressive progress and for many use-cases can reach diagnostic performance comparable to that of human readers. This has especially been shown in the context of breast cancer screening (65–69). However, as discussed above, many factors can influence the technical diagnostic performance of AI tools in clinical practice. While it has been suggested that the combination of human reader and AI tool could help increase overall diagnostic accuracy by either the human detecting an error made by the AI or vice versa, recent studies question this premise and highlight the need to further study the psychological phenomena that can bias decision making in a setting of human-AI interaction. It is well known that automation bias—the tendency to over-rely on automated systems, such as AI-powered decision support tools—can influence human readers and negatively impact their ability to exercise oversight (70). Recently, a study focused on mammography found that even the most experienced readers exhibited this bias in an experimental setting and had significantly worse performance when a purported AI system suggested a wrong BI-RADS category (71). Conversely, the opposite effect described as algorithmic aversion—where information is rejected in a decision making process solely based on it being AI-generated—can also be observed (72). A recent study showed that radiologists and other physicians rated the same information about a chest X-ray as being less reliable when it appeared to come from an AI system than when it appeared to come from a human expert (73). These issues are further complicated by the fact that human-AI interaction may be influenced by details of the user interface’s (UI) design. For example, while many radiologists preferred image overlays to detect pulmonary nodules, it was found that this configuration of the UI did not improve reader performance, while a minimalistic setup with text-only UI output did (74). Similarly, a study evaluating eye gaze in endoscopy found that the usage of a computer-aided system for polyp detection led to significantly reduced eye movements while evaluating endoscopic videos and an increase of misinterpretation of normal mucosa (75). These findings highlight the need for further education on those topics to increase awareness amongst users and stakeholders and allow for safe and successful implementation of AI into clinical routine (76). Opportunities to help mitigate human-AI bias are discussed in Section 8. More focused research into this area is needed to provide reliable evidence on how to best design human-AI interaction.\n\nClinical evaluation\n\nWhile FDA or other relevant authority approval/clearance data provides some insights, testing the AI model on local data, with the local systems and workflows used in practice, is essential to ensure accuracy and relevance when the model is deployed. While local evaluation will need to be tailored to the specific AI model and local resources, Table 3 outlines tactics which may help practices decide if a given model is relevant to local practice and performs with suitable accuracy on local data (Table 3).\n\nTable 3:\n\nA clinical accuracy evaluation process can be performed efficiently and does not require model implementation into your clinical workflow. The first step involves comparing the AI model’s performance on local data against regulatory authority documentation, specifically evaluating accuracy through the lens of radiologist acceptance and engagement with the AI tool. Hence, parameters that are radiologist-facing, including positive and negative predictive values for the disease prevalence are more relevant than overall accuracy, Area Under the Curve (AUC), or sensitivity/specificity. Secondly, calculate an “Enhanced Detection Rate,” the optimized detection that could be obtained through a combined detection of radiologist plus AI true positive results. Thirdly, impressive, or “WOW cases,” should be identified to demonstrate the AI model’s value to users and stakeholders. Fourthly, categorizing AI false positives and, when possible, false negative cases can set radiologist expectations and improve their acceptance of an imperfect AI model (all AI models are imperfect). Finally, all the findings should be reviewed to determine if the AI model is worthy of clinical deployment.\n\nUltimately, the decision lies in the balance between positive predictive value (which is highly dependent on disease prevalence) and the value and number of “WOW” cases. Radiologists are more willing to accept false positives, if the model also identifies pathology that impresses the radiologist or would add value for the patient or other stakeholder. Disease prevalence also has a strong impact on downstream model acceptance. Low disease prevalence AI models produce results with numerous false positives limiting user acceptance. Disease prevalence in a patient group presented to an AI model can be modified by properly selecting patient imaging locations, such as Emergency Department, inpatient, or outpatient. Hence, some AI models may be deployed on a subset of exams because disease prevalence in that exam subset is increased from baseline. For example, pneumothorax (PTX) on Chest XRay (CXR) has a higher prevalence in the inpatient rather than the average population. Limiting a PTX AI model to only inpatient CXRs will provide fewer false positive results and will more likely be accepted by the radiologists from an accuracy standpoint.\n\nUtilizing information from the above 5-step clinical evaluation for radiologist education, coupled with change management, is vital to set user expectations before AI model implementation. A local AI champion plays a significant role in promoting AI adoption among radiologists. Finally, continuous user education throughout the lifecycle of AI utilization and monitoring radiologist AI usage and the combined accuracy of radiologist plus AI are instrumental in ensuring optimal patient care.\n\nPurchasing considerations are summarised in Table 4.\n\nTable 4:\n\nSection 7: What needs to be borne in mind to ensure long-term stability and safety of AI tools?\n\nMonitoring the performance of AI models in clinical use is an important driver for safe and effective implementation of AI in clinical practice and is a key feature of the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Total Product Life Cycle approach (Fig. 1) to regulation of Software as a Medical Device (SaMD), which includes imaging AI (63). End users should expect the performance of static (also known as “locked algorithms”) AI model performance to decline over time, due to shifts in local input data, changes to imaging equipment or protocols, acquisition software updates influencing source image parameters such as noise levels, or naturally occurring changes in patient populations and demographics (77). Therefore, as the use of AI becomes more prevalent and the AI tools being deployed become more diverse, institutions using AI should establish ongoing performance oversight as one function of a local AI governance process (78). Monitoring and a management strategy to ensure AI models are performing as expected over time are important as undetected performance degradation could have significant impact on patient safety and care (79–81). In a potential future state where adaptive intelligence enables local model refinement, monitoring systems must be able to provide both baseline and longitudinal feedback information to continuously learning AI algorithms (77).\n\nAn ideal monitoring solution collects real time data on model performance, aggregates and analyses results comparing against expected performance at the local, regional or national benchmark level when feasible. However, this approach requires ready availability of ground truth and well defined performance benchmarks which is achievable today with some use cases and algorithms but not others. One common approach with triage type AI models that are tuned to identify findings which are also reported by radiologists would be an analysis of concordance or discordance between radiologist reports and model inference output. This approach may not work for quantitative outputs which cannot easily be reproduced by humans at scale or risk scores where validity can only be determined by analysis of longitudinal clinical data. Other targets for monitoring include changes in input metadata (e.g. equipment manufacturer, magnetic field strength or number of CT detectors), other relevant examination parameters and relevant demographic data about individual patients, since deviation of any or several of these from manufacturer specifications can result in degraded performance. It is incumbent on the local AI oversight group to determine on a case by case basis what sufficient monitoring looks like in a particular algorithm. In all cases, but especially when using quantitative models, radiologists may be able to determine the general validity of the AI output by confirming the absence of relevant imaging artifacts that would interfere with AI processing.\n\nStrategies for real-world monitoring of AI in clinical practice should take into account the type of AI model being used and the risk to patient safety if the model performance declines. It will be important for the imaging community to establish monitoring approaches which can combine model output with appropriate forms of longitudinal analysis (with future imaging or EHR derived data or combination), through comparison to other clinical biomarkers of the same disease process, and with benchmark performance data from use of the same algorithm in a range of patients and a multitude of institutions. It should be noted that for almost all AI models with current regulatory approval, the model inference serves to augment, not replace, the radiologists’ interpretations, and therefore, patient-specific model failures of diagnostic or triage software are typically identified by the user before radiological reports are finalized and patient care initiated. However, when unsupervised autonomously-functioning AI algorithms emerge, robust monitoring solutions will be required to ensure patient safety. In future autonomous AI implementation, thorough understanding of failure modes and associated safety net processes may become paramount. This is further explored in Section 8. While we expect most developers of commercially available AI solutions to be actively engaged in developing mechanisms for monitoring the effectiveness of their products, currently we are unaware of specific regulatory requirements of manufacturers for longitudinal AI performance monitoring, often referred to by regulators as post-market surveillance. As a result, nascent monitoring solutions are not standardized. Depending on the model and risk to patient safety a variety of monitoring strategies could be employed, ranging from real time continuous monitoring to periodic monitoring. Institutions should develop a clearly defined escalation and resolution strategy when monitoring detects model failure or performance drift occurs that defines the notification and action plan, and the mode of operation while the model performance is being assessed and the cause of model failure determined. In all cases, the monitoring strategy is predicated chiefly on the feasibility of well-defined performance parameters or a readily-available comparator (such as benchmark or ground truth).\n\nPeriodic monitoring of model performance\n\nRe-evaluation of AI model performance using updated local data sets at specified intervals, but at least annually, may be an appropriate monitoring mechanism for models where gathering real-time data on model performance is limited (quantification, workflow enhancement, etc.) or in instances where patient safety will not be immediately impacted (80). Such a system requires that a new up-to-date evaluation data set be created using an appropriate number of clinical cases and parameters similar to the initial validation set to re-evaluate the performance of the model under current conditions. While this type of performance monitoring system could be useful for many of the AI models in clinical use, limitations include the time delay between ongoing use of the model and the occurrence of the discrete monitoring activity, which delays the institutions’ ability to take corrective actions should degradation occur. Another specific scenario which may require a re-evaluation of a model’s performance would be the issuance of a new model version by the manufacturer. It cannot be simply assumed by user sites that intended benefits introduced by a manufacturer’s deployment of the latest version of a model automatically generalize to the local practice.\n\nMonitoring for causes of data drift affecting model performance\n\nSince changes in equipment, protocols and naturally occurring changes in population demographics are known causes of input data (source image) drift and potentially reduced AI model performance, institutions could elect to define baseline input data characteristics at the time of model acceptance and then monitor for data drift against that baseline state specific to each AI model (82). Identification of relevant changes in input parameters could trigger the re-evaluation process described above for periodic monitoring. By monitoring for individual components of data drift, institutions could trigger re-evaluation of model performance depending on timing and severity of changes and initiate appropriate steps to safeguard patient care.\n\nContinuous monitoring of model performance\n\nStrategies for continuously monitoring AI model performance cover many of the risks which should be evaluated before AI model introduction (outlined in Section 6 above). While real-time determinations of statistical parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value are not possible during continuous monitoring, the algorithm’s performance compared to the interpreting radiologist’s final report, where possible, can be used as a surrogate for model accuracy. As explained above, harvesting of metadata about the examination should form part of this monitoring, and should include equipment manufacturer, protocol used, radiation dose and patient demographics. When available, the contemporaneous radiologist interpretation is considered a surrogate for ground truth, but the strength of this opportunistic labelling may be different from labelling provided during initial validation studies. Ideally this data collection could occur in the background, comparing information automatically extracted via suitable natural language processing methods against the radiologists’ reports as an AI accuracy measure, and data contained in the DICOM header to monitor the compliance of examination parameters with AI manufacturer specification of input data whenever feasible. Limited patient demographic information may also be found in the DICOM header and should be incorporated in the data collection. More robust monitoring and bias detection solutions may require expanded patient demographics. Continuous AI monitoring offers several advantages over episodic re-evaluations. Relevant information about AI model performance should be recorded in a dedicated AI data registry that allows generation of reports across multiple sites and geographies. Such benchmark data may be useful to individual sites as well as to the AI vendors (79). At the local level, registry reports would allow institutions to identify performance degradation within their own local environment and could enable a systematic evaluation of the sources of potential data drift on a near real-time basis. For example, an institution with multiple CT scanners in their clinical workflow might identify performance degradation relative to their own historic performance in an AI model designed to detect intracranial hemorrhage. Hypothetically, analysis of the aggregate institutional registry data might show the poor performance to be limited to a single machine. Further analysis might also show that the performance degradation occurred after a software upgrade to that machine or change in examination protocol. Systematic analysis of cases that are not processed represent another important monitoring target. Such cases may point to systematic or anecdotal failure in the data acquisition or data transfer, impeding intended AI inference and preventing downstream clinical action to benefit from the same. Monitoring for non-performance represents an important building block of a local quality assurance system for clinical AI, which will be increasingly important as dependency of the clinical enterprise on AI increases in the future.\n\nAggregation of data from multiple institutions using the same AI models could provide information to developers to identify performance gaps that can be addressed in future versions of the algorithm, as well as meeting any future post-market surveillance regulatory requirements. While none of the AI models in clinical use employ continuous learning as a means for model improvement or local tuning, a hypothetical advantage of continuous monitoring solutions is the ability to inform future adaptive AI models with additional training data for continuous learning. However, there are significant limitations to the approach of continuous monitoring. Today such solutions may not be applicable for many (if any) AI models, including those performing quantitative tasks, and other AI models where performance cannot be measured real-time. Furthermore, continuous monitoring requires integration of production systems within a given institution, including information that may not be accessible to a manufacturer without local assistance and requisite infrastructure. Standards for this, specific regulatory guidance and the IT infrastructure for AI registries do not widely exist, and developing internal continuous monitoring solutions is likely to be cost- and resource-prohibitive for most institutions. Pilot projects for AI registries are underway; better understanding of the importance of aggregation and analysis of AI performance signal over time is likely to increase end-user interest in registry participation and may be a cost effective option to support this cause. However, in the absence of any regulatory requirements or availability of continuous learning AI models, demand may be limited. Currently, there are few AI models in limited markets that have regulatory approval for autonomously functioning AI (83), and the parameters for and frequency of evaluating model performance have yet to be determined. These parameters will vary with the disease process being evaluated, the risk to the patient in the event of model failure, and the prevalence of the disease in the target population. Therefore, one could imagine that performance monitoring could include intermittent random sampling of a pre-determined number of cases with ground truth comparison to spot-monitor performance over time.\n\nFuture local tuning and continuous learning AI algorithms\n\nLocal tuning of AI models and continuous-learning AI algorithms prior to deployment have theoretical potential to improve the local performance of AI products. However, to date all AI tools which have received regulatory approval are static and cannot be locally tuned or undergo modifications using adaptive learning techniques. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has released draft guidance for a “Predetermined Change Control Plan” (84) that would allow future modification to commercial algorithms for both local tuning and continuous learning. Any change control plan must include robust real-time AI model performance and measures that mitigate patient risk. Currently, this guidance has not been implemented but would be for models that are in the process of obtaining approval rather than those already approved.\n\nOther considerations: AI governance, managing technology lifecycle and local user environment\n\nGiven the complexity of managing all aspects of the AI lifecycle in clinical environments, provider entities engaging in the use of clinical AI are well served by formalizing local AI governance oversight and associated processes (78). This is needed to deal with the many challenges in all phases of the AI product life cycle, which include procuring well-functioning AI, monitoring its performance over time, making adjustments to the local environment (e.g. scanner protocols, AI orchestration, device configuration, workflow integration including opportunistic capture of ground truth labels, etc.) over time as needed, and an orderly process to replace currently deployed products with future updates or alternative products. Often forgotten, but no less important, are the effects of the ever-more prevalent staff turnover amongst clinical end-users, radiologists and technical staff, including informaticists. As new users arrive in a local practice, they need to be properly assimilated, oriented, and trained in the available AI tools and associated work processes, to become effective participants in this technology-assisted care delivery paradigm. Ensuring that all local stakeholders are up to date and competent in the use of AI technology is a shared responsibility between vendors and the leaders of local institutional governance and oversight.\n\nTake-home points\n\nMonitoring the performance of AI models in clinical practice is needed to ensure that any performance degradation is identified early so that appropriate measures can be taken to ensure patient safety. At a minimum, yearly re-evaluation of the need to assess model performance should be conducted, with monitoring of parameters known to be associated with drivers of input data drift. The need for more frequent re-evaluations should also be considered based on patient risk in the event of model failure and clinical decision relevance of a specific AI output. While not applicable to all AI models and clinical practices, continuous AI monitoring that captures model performance, examination parameters and patient demographics in data registries offers significant advantages over periodic re-evaluation of AI models, including real-time identification of local causes of diminished performance and providing developers with aggregated data for model improvement. Robust continuous performance monitoring will be needed prior to deployment of any autonomously functioning AI algorithms and is also a requisite for continuously-learning AI models.\n\nKey statements—Long-term stability & safety of AI tools—\n\nNaturally occurring data drift will cause AI model performance to degrade over time and should be anticipated by end-users.\n\nMonitoring strategies should include at minimum yearly re-valuation the performance of all AI models being used in clinical practice so that appropriate measures can be taken to ensure patient safety.\n\nMonitoring for changes in parameters known to be associated with input data drift could trigger more frequent re-evaluations.\n\nContinuous AI monitoring solutions that capture model performance, examination parameters and patient demographics in data registries that provide reports to end-users and developers offer significant advantages over periodic re-evaluation of AI models.\n\nRobust continuous performance monitoring will be needed prior to deployment of any autonomously functioning AI algorithms and required for continuous-learning AI models.\n\nSection 8: How can we assess whether (fully or partially) autonomous AI is likely/appropriate/ safe in a particular clinical setting?\n\nThere are two distinct scenarios of AI implementation within radiology: augmentative AI and autonomous AI, each presenting unique considerations requiring rigorous scrutiny from both safety and ethical standpoints in the context of patient care.\n\nAugmentative AI\n\nIn this scenario, radiologists collaborate with AI systems to enhance diagnostic accuracy and drive efficiency. This collaboration provides an opportunity to increase the value provided by radiologists, but is not without challenges. As discussed in Section 6 (Human-AI Interaction), one crucial issue is the potential introduction of human–computer biases into the radiologic interpretation (59, 70–73). These biases need to be both clarified and managed to ensure the AI’s output does not negatively influence the radiologist’s judgment. There are two general types of bias that can be introduced in a human–computer system, over-reliance, and under-reliance. Over-reliance, also known as automation bias increases the risk of False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) results: if the AI is right most of the time, radiologists may stop verifying the outputs, or come to trust the AI more than their own judgment. In this scenario the radiologist will accept incorrect AI results. Under-reliance has the same effect for the opposite reason. If the radiologist does not trust the AI results, they may disregard accurate AI output, also increasing FP and FN results. Ultimately, the output of the combination of radiologist plus the AI system must be optimized. These challenges can be further compounded by negative workplace attitudes (85) and factors that decrease personal perception of accountability (86) including radiologist burnout, and high workloads, both currently ubiquitous in radiology practice.\n\nA robust approach to mitigating biases and challenges related to reliance involves continuous radiologist education about AI capabilities and limitations. Providing comprehensive information about AI decision-making, its results, and confidence levels can enhance transparency and help radiologists make informed judgments. In addition, categorizing scenarios where AI assistance may falter, and integrating that information into a robust training program, can empower radiologists to recognize and rectify errors. The accuracy of the AI system also affects rad-AI bias—bias is decreased by more accurate AI results (87). Hence, identifying the most accurate AI model has clinical relevance. Finally, the measurement of rad-AI accuracy, along with directed feedback, can further refine the system’s performance.\n\nEthical considerations surrounding augmentative AI are multifaceted. In settings where subspecialty radiologist coverage is limited, the introduction of AI assistance can significantly impact patient outcomes. However, the reliance on AI may lead to a dilemma where the presence of AI might influence the allocation of resources for training and retaining subspecialists. Careful consideration is needed to balance the ethical implications of AI augmentation in resource-constrained environments.\n\nAutonomous AI\n\nIn contrast to augmentative AI, autonomous AI operates without direct human oversight, making independent diagnostic decisions. This scenario raises heightened safety and ethical considerations (11). Autonomous AI should be subject to stringent performance standards and comprehensive and continuous testing to ensure its reliability and accuracy. It is essential to critically assess the system’s failure modes, considering that statistics from regulatory approval or vendor-provided accuracy rates might not adequately reflect real-world performance across various environments.\n\nFor autonomous AI, a rigorous ongoing monitoring program is imperative to detect and rectify errors promptly (11). Training healthcare professionals in recognizing failure modes and offering a simple mechanism to disable autonomous AI when necessary is essential to avoid unchecked errors that could jeopardize patient care. Holistic continuous AI accuracy monitoring mechanisms are not yet mature. However, relying on such an a posteriori system to detect errors means that AI models may continue to provide inaccurate results for a period before there is sufficient data to confirm these inaccuracies. To gain earlier insights into AI’s accuracy, additional tools for assessing expected AI outcomes based on input data (e.g., determining whether the input data falls within or outside the training data distribution) or comparing the results of one AI model to those of other AI models simultaneously can be employed (88).\n\nAutonomous AI should be designed to initiate actions that are transparent, identifiable, and discoverable. The capacity to disable the AI system swiftly and effectively in the event of failure is crucial for patient safety. A streamlined process to address and mitigate failures should be in place to prevent repeating mistakes.\n\nIn communities where radiology services are scarce, the deployment of autonomous AI raises complex ethical questions. While autonomous AI can provide diagnostic insights in the absence of skilled radiologists, decisions made by AI systems could potentially lack nuanced human judgment. Striking a balance between accessible healthcare and maintaining diagnostic quality becomes a critical ethical concern.\n\nUltimately, the successful implementation of AI in radiology relies on an understanding of its implications, and proactive measures, including radiologist education, AI explainability, and radiologist-AI accuracy monitoring to address safety and ethical concerns.\n\nSection 9: Conclusion\n\nArtificial intelligence in radiology is here to stay. It has the potential to add significant value to our care for patients, and to expand the horizons of what imaging can offer. Radiomics, for example, is an expanding field of data extraction and analysis that could not exist without AI.\n\nAs this exciting new technology increases its penetration and impact in healthcare, it is vital that it do so in a manner that is safe, and directed entirely towards benefit. Development, promotion and clinical adoption of AI tools must be aligned with benefit for those on whom these tools will be used (89). Inevitably, commercial interests must be considered when developing and adopting AI tools, but these interests should not take primacy.\n\nIn this multisociety paper, we have endeavoured to provide guidance for developers, purchasers and users of AI in radiology to ensure that the practical issues that surround all stages of AI from conception to long-term integration in healthcare are clear, understood and addressed, and that patient and societal safety and well-being are the primary drivers of all decisions.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis article is simultaneously published in Insights into Imaging (DOI https://doi.org/10.1186/s13244-023-01541-3), Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Oncology (DOI https://doi.org/10.1111/1754-9485.13612), Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal (DOI https://doi.org/10.1177/08465371231222229), Journal of the American College of Radiology (DOI https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2023.12.005), and Radiology: Artificial Intelligence (DOI https://doi.org/10.1148/ryai.230513).
