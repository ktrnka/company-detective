      "# [Save Time and Decrease Burnout with Radiology AI Software](https://www.radai.com/)\nRad AI Continuity is the most comprehensive follow-up management platform on the market, tracking more than 50 categories of incidental findings and significantly increasing patient follow-up rates. We’re very excited about this collaboration as it will allow us to have improved visibility and provide a safety net over our entire patient population to ensure our patients feel informed and empowered.\n\nWith Continuity, we have a 100% radiology safety net. Every single radiology report that comes in with an incidental finding has been communicated to the appropriate stakeholders. We're tracking whether or not those follow-ups happen within the appropriate, recommended timeframe mitigating all our liability to ensure that we keep patients in our network.\n\nThe amazing thing about Rad AI Reporting is that you're able to achieve exponential efficiency gains, but with less perceived effort. It doesn't benefit you if you're going faster but you know you're going fast because you're more fatigued. The idea is to smooth things out in a way where you're almost in a flow state, and Rad AI Reporting does that.\n\nHaving greatly benefited from using Rad AI Impressions, we are thrilled to add Continuity to our current partnership with the team at Rad AI. The management of incidental findings in radiology reports is a key focus for our group as it’s incredibly beneficial for the patients we serve. After evaluating every vendor in this space, we found that Continuity provides the most automated and most comprehensive solution in follow-up management.\n\nIt gives you the ability to generate a complete report in the interpreting radiologist's own language, whether you use structured reporting or dictate freely, just by dictating the pertinent findings. This saves an enormous amount of wasted energy in having to create full sentences.\n\nRad AI Impressions is what we have all been waiting for! Providing much-needed efficiency gains in my daily workflow life is sometimes absolutely surreal! It is like I have my own trainee who perfectly excels at impressions.\n\nUsing Rad AI Impressions to auto-generate my impressions has been wonderful. I’ve gotten to use it on overnight shifts, and it’s a game changer. It really helps with breezing through case volume with less fatigue.\n\nWhile hard to measure in minutes or seconds or even dollars, one huge value is the \"coffee sip\" factor. Before Rad AI Impressions, I was talking all the time and my cup of coffee in the morning would inevitably get cold. With Rad AI impressions, I get just long enough of a break to take a sip of warm coffee. And each time I sip my warm coffee, I smile.\n\nRad AI exceeded radiologist expectations out of the gate. Seamless integration permitted our radiologists to immediately realize the efficiencies of the Rad AI Impressions platform. With Rad AI, our radiologists reported feeling less stressed with more time available to review studies or tend to other tasks. This is exactly the type of IT solution needed to help reduce radiologists’ burnout and boost job satisfaction.\n\nHaving greatly benefited from using Rad AI Impressions, we are thrilled to add Continuity to our current partnership with the team at Rad AI. The management of incidental findings in radiology reports is a key focus for our group as it’s incredibly beneficial for the patients we serve. After evaluating every vendor in this space, we found that Continuity provides the most automated and most comprehensive solution in follow-up management.\n\nWe have seen how critical it is to close the loop on significant incidental findings and what a challenging problem it is to address using our currently available resources. By automating the majority of steps related to patient follow-ups, Rad AI removes those manual tasks from our clinical team and gives them back more time to focus on caring for their patients.\n\nWhen we recently discussed our expansions and renewals for AI solutions, we saw Rad AI as a must-have. If we were to rank our solutions, it's at the top. With a high volume of high acuity cases, Rad AI Impressions helps us manage our caseload. The performance continues to improve -- in 90 to 95% of the impressions that it generates, I don't have to edit anything, and the consensus guideline recommendations are working really well.\n\nWe are committed to the patients and healthcare entities we serve, and we believe that partnering with Rad AI will improve the efficiency of our radiologists and increase the value associated with our services. We look forward to using Rad AI Impressions' automated impression technology to make our radiologists more effective and to help decrease burnout.\n\nRad AI Impressions will assist our radiologists in providing the highest-quality reports, while greatly reducing the rework that is built into the process. We’re excited to partner with Rad AI, as the feedback we’ve received from other Strategic Radiology members nationally has been overwhelmingly positive, and we’re looking forward to the same experience at our practice.\n\nWe’ve been incredibly pleased with the partnership that has developed with Rad AI. As a CIO, your aim is to make investments in technology that make a tangible difference throughout the practice. Once the Rad AI Impressions rollout began, the benefits spread 'word of mouth' style like a brushfire. The radiologists became the largest supporters of the product – touting the efficiency, quality and overall reduction in fatigue improvements amongst themselves. Expansion of the agreement was a no-brainer. I would strongly encourage any radiology practice CIO seeking an impactful AI investment to prioritize a relationship with Rad AI.\n\nEven though Rad AI has an incredible reputation in the radiology community, we were hesitant to try AI in our practice and wanted to prove it out for ourselves. After using Rad AI Impressions with a small initial set of users, we are so glad we did as we saw an immediate impact. We are now rapidly expanding to the rest of the radiologists in our practice.\n\nAfter thoroughly evaluating numerous radiology AI solutions via our collaborative we believe Rad AI Impressions will provide the most impactful value proposition for our member groups. Rad AI impressions' automated impression generator extracted from the radiologist’s dictated findings not only results in enhanced report quality and efficiency, but also helps alleviate fatigue by the end of a shift.\n\nI knew from the first time I used Rad AI Impressions it would be a complete game-changer by allowing us to turn around the highest-quality reports faster with fewer addenda. Of all the technology and solutions that we’ve implemented for our practice, Rad AI Impressions has made the biggest impact on our efficiency and quality. I have personally reached out to colleagues of mine to prioritize a partnership with Rad AI.\n\nOur practice has been on the forefront of innovation in radiology, building on our heritage of leading the way with transformative technologies that ultimately prove to become the gold standard for radiology practices. We believe our partnership with Rad AI will enable us to maintain this type of technological leadership, and Rad AI Impressions will be a powerfully assistive tool for our radiologists.\n\nWe expanded our partnership with Rad AI to every radiologist not just because of the benefits our radiologists experienced, but also because the Rad AI team is incredible to work with. They truly listen and prioritize our feedback.\n\nOur initial group of radiologist users were very impressed by Rad AI’s ability to reduce fatigue and improve productivity using artificial intelligence, while improving the quality of patient care. We evaluate many AI vendors, and Rad AI proved to not only be a valuable solution our radiologists wanted to use, but they’ve also been a fantastic partner in helping us fully leverage the power of AI to do more for our patients.\n\nIt’s important to Inland Imaging to remain at the forefront of implementing groundbreaking technology to best serve our patients and provide the optimal environment for our radiologists to do their best work. Our radiologists are impressed with the efficiency gains, quality gains, and reduction in fatigue. Rad AI is an ideal partner that is both innovative and customer-focused, and places a premium on developing long-term partnerships.\n\nRad AI has made a big difference in my daily productivity and endurance throughout my day. I am now less mentally fatigued towards the end of my day because I do not have the added mental strain of summarizing my findings in the impression. The program does it for me. I also find myself catching more voice recognition errors when I read over the generated impression which allows me to go back and fix these errors in the body of the report… an added bonus!",

The performance continues to improve -- in 90 to 95% of the impressions that it generates, I don't have to edit anything, and the consensus guideline recommendations are working really well.\n\nWe are committed to the patients and healthcare entities we serve, and we believe that partnering with Rad AI will improve the efficiency of our radiologists and increase the value associated with our services. We look forward to using Rad AI Impressions' automated impression technology to make our radiologists more effective and to help decrease burnout.\n\nRad AI Impressions will assist our radiologists in providing the highest-quality reports, while greatly reducing the rework that is built into the process. We’re excited to partner with Rad AI, as the feedback we’ve received from other Strategic Radiology members nationally has been overwhelmingly positive, and we’re looking forward to the same experience at our practice.\n\nWe’ve been incredibly pleased with the partnership that has developed with Rad AI. As a CIO, your aim is to make investments in technology that make a tangible difference throughout the practice. Once the Rad AI Impressions rollout began, the benefits spread 'word of mouth' style like a brushfire. The radiologists became the largest supporters of the product – touting the efficiency, quality and overall reduction in fatigue improvements amongst themselves. Expansion of the agreement was a no-brainer. I would strongly encourage any radiology practice CIO seeking an impactful AI investment to prioritize a relationship with Rad AI.\n\nEven though Rad AI has an incredible reputation in the radiology community, we were hesitant to try AI in our practice and wanted to prove it out for ourselves. After using Rad AI Impressions with a small initial set of users, we are so glad we did as we saw an immediate impact. We are now rapidly expanding to the rest of the radiologists in our practice.\n\nAfter thoroughly evaluating numerous radiology AI solutions via our collaborative we believe Rad AI Impressions will provide the most impactful value proposition for our member groups. Rad AI impressions' automated impression generator extracted from the radiologist’s dictated findings not only results in enhanced report quality and efficiency, but also helps alleviate fatigue by the end of a shift.\n\nI knew from the first time I used Rad AI Impressions it would be a complete game-changer by allowing us to turn around the highest-quality reports faster with fewer addenda. Of all the technology and solutions that we’ve implemented for our practice, Rad AI Impressions has made the biggest impact on our efficiency and quality. I have personally reached out to colleagues of mine to prioritize a partnership with Rad AI.\n\nOur practice has been on the forefront of innovation in radiology, building on our heritage of leading the way with transformative technologies that ultimately prove to become the gold standard for radiology practices. We believe our partnership with Rad AI will enable us to maintain this type of technological leadership, and Rad AI Impressions will be a powerfully assistive tool for our radiologists.\n\nWe expanded our partnership with Rad AI to every radiologist not just because of the benefits our radiologists experienced, but also because the Rad AI team is incredible to work with. They truly listen and prioritize our feedback.\n\nOur initial group of radiologist users were very impressed by Rad AI’s ability to reduce fatigue and improve productivity using artificial intelligence, while improving the quality of patient care. We evaluate many AI vendors, and Rad AI proved to not only be a valuable solution our radiologists wanted to use, but they’ve also been a fantastic partner in helping us fully leverage the power of AI to do more for our patients.\n\nIt’s important to Inland Imaging to remain at the forefront of implementing groundbreaking technology to best serve our patients and provide the optimal environment for our radiologists to do their best work. Our radiologists are impressed with the efficiency gains, quality gains, and reduction in fatigue. Rad AI is an ideal partner that is both innovative and customer-focused, and places a premium on developing long-term partnerships.\n\nRad AI has made a big difference in my daily productivity and endurance throughout my day. I am now less mentally fatigued towards the end of my day because I do not have the added mental strain of summarizing my findings in the impression. The program does it for me. I also find myself catching more voice recognition errors when I read over the generated impression which allows me to go back and fix these errors in the body of the report… an added bonus!",

      "# [Rad AI Reporting](https://app.radai.com/docs/fhircast/)\nFHIRcast\n\nFHIRcast is a standard developed to provide real-time synchronization and context sharing between healthcare applications. It builds on the foundations of FHIR resources, but focuses specifically on ensuring that multiple applications remain synchronized in real-time as users interact with them.\n\nFHIRcast requires a centralized system to manage real-time synchronization and context sharing. This system is referred to as a “FHIRcast hub”.\n\nHere’s how FHIRcast works:\n\nSubscription setup: Applications subscribe to a FHIRcast hub for specific events. This is typically done during application startup.\n\nEvent triggering: When a user interacts with an application (e.g., opens a patient record or an imaging study), the application sends an event to the FHIRcast hub.\n\nReal-time notification: The FHIRcast hub immediately broadcasts this event to all subscribed applications via WebSockets, ensuring they are notified in real-time.\n\nContext synchronization: Subscribed applications receive the event notification and adjust their context accordingly. For example, if an imaging study is opened in one application, other applications might display related patient information or open the same study.\n\nA radiologist opens an imaging study in their PACS.\n\nThe PACS sends an event to the FHIRcast hub, indicating that the ImagingStudy FHIR resource has been opened.\n\nThe FHIRcast hub broadcasts this event to all subscribed applications, including the Rad AI Reporting application.\n\nThe Rad AI Reporting application receives the notification and automatically opens the same ImagingStudy, ready for the radiologist to dictate their findings into a new report.",

The stats you are quoting are for their Impressions product which can work with existing dictation platforms (Powerscribe, Fluency, etc.) to auto-generate the impression section for the report. Impressions has been around and is widely used. We've just started using it for a small group of radiologists (on it for less than a month) and feedback from the initial batch of rads has been positive.  \n  \nAs mentioned by someone else, Rad AI Reporting is a full dictation system that replaces Powerscribe/Fluency and was new to the market in 2024. There are at least a few clients in production with it - Radiology Associates of North Texas and Naugatuk Valley Radiology are the two I know about.\n\n#### Comment ID m70fdo0 with +3 score by [(enjoimark, Reddit, 2025-01-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PACSAdmin/comments/1i0euxy/rad_ai_experience/m70fdo0/) (in reply to ID m6xh630):\nAlso, companies can just make numbers up.

      "# Post ID 18bymqt: Powerscribe One -- are you for real? with +12 score by [(stumpovich, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Radiology/comments/18bymqt/powerscribe_one_are_you_for_real/)\nSo now that auntminnie is effectively defunct, I figured I would search for help here. If there are any other active forums that someone could point me to that radiologists actually visit, I'd be interested as well.\n\nSo, my job finally made the mistake of \"upgrading\" to PSOne. I could rant for hours about it and not even scratch the surface. I've read horror stories on auntminnie and heard from other radiologists about PSOne, but I was actually impressed to see that it was actually even worse in practice than everyone was saying. I mean -- they eliminated keyboard shortcuts, the UI is disastrous, you need 5-6 extra clicks to do anything you could do in PS360, the macro and report editor is schizophrenic, adding random spaces, new lines, deleting them to the point that it honestly feels like a psychological experiment someone is playing on me, everything requires switching tabs now, you can't pull up the order page without it taking up half the screen, etc.\n\nNow, the one fucking thing that continues to drive me insane 50 times a day is -- clicking at the end of a sentence or anywhere after it (it seems this mostly happens in impression fields, since for some reason in the findings section it works normally, although just like everything in PSOne it is totally inconsistent behavior and sometimes does it, sometimes no), will put your cursor BEFORE the punctuation mark. So anything you say will just be added to the end of the last sentence BEFORE the period, completely fucking up your report. The only way to fix this is, no matter where you click, you then have to press right arrow to get to after the period. How the FUCKKKKKKK was this missed in testing? Like, how the fuck are we supposed to dictate?\n\nHas ANYONE found a solution for this behavior? I am wondering if like, maybe you need some kind of special impression field, some formatting, who the fuck knows. I also wouldn't be surprised if other people using PSOne don't experience this, because the software is THAT fucking inconsistent.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n## Comment ID kc7nmgx with +8 score by [(MocoMojo, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Radiology/comments/18bymqt/powerscribe_one_are_you_for_real/kc7nmgx/) (in reply to ID 18bymqt):\nIt’s horrible. \n\nIn addition, our PACS (Visage) now crashes 2-4 times a day (the is never happened with PS360).\n\n### Comment ID kc7qy0x with +3 score by [(tell_her_a_story, Reddit, 2023-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Radiology/comments/18bymqt/powerscribe_one_are_you_for_real/kc7qy0x/) (in reply to ID kc7nmgx):\nWe're running Sectra with PS One, seeing at least 4 crashes per day on average.

Yeah we got Visage so it's a net upgrade overall but oh my god, why couldn't they just keep PS360.

It somehow got fixed (not sure how, unfortunately). \n\nOur group made the switch because all the servers can be housed on-site, which the admins said would save lots of money (won’t say how much, though). \n\nAlso, I like to use a stand alone mic instead of the mic in the dictaphone (gives me elbow issues).

Am told by vendor that new UX version received a service patch in last few months and has now been getting good reviews, with a lot of the issues discussed in this thread being fixed.

Right now we don't really use anything besides pulmonary nodule counter (SUPER helpful) and pneumothorax detector for CXR. \n\nWe tested brain MRI AI analysis briefly last year but it degraded the images so much, was not helpful, and did not incorporate into our PACS well so it was stopped. \n\nThere has been no talk of implementing any other AI software. I am wondering what you guys have used so far and how helpful it has been. \n\n## Comment ID krepqvs with +39 score by [(Nancy_Reagans_Taint, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/1avyuwi/what_ai_are_you_using_in_your_hospitals_right_now/krepqvs/) (in reply to ID 1avyuwi):\nWe residents are the AI for our attendings\n\n## Comment ID krdw2c3 with +61 score by [(RockHardRocks, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/1avyuwi/what_ai_are_you_using_in_your_hospitals_right_now/krdw2c3/) (in reply to ID 1avyuwi):\nNone, and never have despite working at 2 large academic centers and a private practice.\n\nThe biggest trend in AI for radiology at the moment is for report structuring, and by that I mean taking your dictated findings and generating a report/impression as a way for boosting productivity. These are the kinds of AI that will actually be useful in radiology, not the mythical radiologist replacement every tech bro and premed thinks about.\n\n### Comment ID krdx8yx with +11 score by [(Kavbot2000, Reddit, 2024-02-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/1avyuwi/what_ai_are_you_using_in_your_hospitals_right_now/krdx8yx/) (in reply to ID krdw2c3):\nWe use this service to generate impressions.

It always thinks the M1 segments are occluded, and literally earlier today it missed a complete M2 occlusion on one of my cases.\n\n\nI’m not sure if the RAPID series on Ct perfusion is an AI thing but we use that to get a mismatch volume/ratio for penumbra.

While the typical start-up culture of sexual harassment does not exist (truly a wonderful job of that), there are many, many micro-aggressions against women. Also, some \"favorite\" mid-level leaders treat other teammates terribly.

Knowing the heart of many people - I really tried to dismiss this. It quickly became clear that the expectation was for women to do the women's work. Heavy lifting before, during, and after events would be left to only female team members. Leadership would come halfway through the event, not acknowledge them, and leave before the event was over, often in dangerous cities or situations without offering to help. It's been elevated to the point that other companies noticed and offered to stay behind to ensure they had the necessary help. Leaders often complained about spending time with team members and repeatedly said they didn't like team-building activities, conferences, etc. Often, ideas and projects from the only female team member are claimed by other team members. Female team members are cut off in meetings, and important initiatives are not supported by leadership that is assigned to female team members. I would also caution you to provide feedback in the weekly employee surveys. Shortly after, a few began sharing their dissatisfaction; it was brought up in team meetings about \"negativity,\" and they were let go shortly after. A few \"favorites\" play games - what they say in private slack messages and publically are wildly different and borderline harassing. They will be publically praised in all team meetings while their abusive behavior towards other teammates is ignored. I truly don't think they are aware of the microaggressions (and likely could be addressed). Still, a few people on the team do the most outwardly blatantly toxic behaviors privately, and senior leadership is likely unaware. But because those individuals are constantly being praised \"as the only people on the team doing things correctly\" it isn't possible to bring up concerns.",

All meetings are recorded as the leadership cannot trust their employees to do work. It is amazing how much time people spend playing politics when there is not even a working product nor a market fit yet.\r\n\r\nAnimosity between cofounders as the CFO has taken over as CEO. While they claim that the company was built by radiologists for radiologists, the radiologist / ex-CEO has no power, always working alone at a corner of the office away from other employees. \"Automate radiologists' paycheck\" is the true culture of the company. Condescending memes about radiologists are posted publicly. The ML team is heavily inflated with a lot of ego. Be prepared to make avocado toasts for your manager. Their AI does not work and they cover up their flaws by not having tests, blotching usage stat, and blaming the radiologists for not being \"consistent\".\r\n\r\nThe current CEO has assembled an executive team of yes-people who are willing to play his game and support him no matter what. While they have no real autonomy, they are rewarded with promotions beyond their experience or competence. If you dare to disagree with him, you'd be ushered out of the back door. The day when shelter-in-place was in order, he was enraged and said \"Why don't we let the people who is going to die, die, instead of ruining the economy?!\" Employees who criticized his handling of COVID were layoff a week later due to \"performance issues\".\r\n\r\nXenophobic and sexist comments get toasted around regularly.

The team is very receptive to new ideas, as well as to people taking on new responsibilities when they feel ready\n- Fun, driven, intelligent group to work with. Given the relatively small team, everyone is an expert in their own niche and is more than willing to teach others\n- Meaningful product. Coming from medicine/academia, it's not uncommon to see companies designing for medical problems that don't exist, or that would not be easily integrated into existing systems. RAD AI does a great job at making sure each product would actually have direct clinical impact",

While they claim that the company was built by radiologists for radiologists, the radiologist / ex-CEO has no power, always working alone at a corner of the office away from other employees. \"Automate radiologists' paycheck\" is the true culture of the company. Condescending memes about radiologists are posted publicly. The ML team is heavily inflated with a lot of ego. Be prepared to make avocado toasts for your manager. Their AI does not work and they cover up their flaws by not having tests, blotching usage stat, and blaming the radiologists for not being \"consistent\".\r\n\r\nThe current CEO has assembled an executive team of yes-people who are willing to play his game and support him no matter what. While they have no real autonomy, they are rewarded with promotions beyond their experience or competence. If you dare to disagree with him, you'd be ushered out of the back door. The day when shelter-in-place was in order, he was enraged and said \"Why don't we let the people who is going to die, die, instead of ruining the economy?!\" Employees who criticized his handling of COVID were layoff a week later due to \"performance issues\".\r\n\r\nXenophobic and sexist comments get toasted around regularly.

Intentionally set them up for failure, stab them in the back, and stop at nothing to elevate themselves - and that behavior is rewarded. This is going to breed a toxic, toxic culture if not quickly addressed.",
        "cons": "Everything started great - until I realized the lack of women in leadership positions. (Take a look at the website). Knowing the heart of many people - I really tried to dismiss this. It quickly became clear that the expectation was for women to do the women's work. Heavy lifting before, during, and after events would be left to only female team members. Leadership would come halfway through the event, not acknowledge them, and leave before the event was over, often in dangerous cities or situations without offering to help. It's been elevated to the point that other companies noticed and offered to stay behind to ensure they had the necessary help. Leaders often complained about spending time with team members and repeatedly said they didn't like team-building activities, conferences, etc. Often, ideas and projects from the only female team member are claimed by other team members. Female team members are cut off in meetings, and important initiatives are not supported by leadership that is assigned to female team members. I would also caution you to provide feedback in the weekly employee surveys. Shortly after, a few began sharing their dissatisfaction; it was brought up in team meetings about \"negativity,\" and they were let go shortly after. A few \"favorites\" play games - what they say in private slack messages and publically are wildly different and borderline harassing. They will be publically praised in all team meetings while their abusive behavior towards other teammates is ignored. I truly don't think they are aware of the microaggressions (and likely could be addressed). Still, a few people on the team do the most outwardly blatantly toxic behaviors privately, and senior leadership is likely unaware. But because those individuals are constantly being praised \"as the only people on the team doing things correctly\" it isn't possible to bring up concerns.",

      "# [AGFA HealthCare and Rad AI Announce Strategic Collaboration to Enhance Radiology Workflows](https://www.radai.com/news/agfa-healthcare-and-rad-ai-announce-strategic-collaboration-to-enhance-radiology-workflows)\nCHICAGO, Dec. 2, 2024 -- AGFA HealthCare and Rad AI are announcing a strategic collaboration to enhance radiology workflows. Building on its leadership in Enterprise Imaging, AGFA HealthCare is raising the bar withRad AI Reporting and FHIRcast integration. These cutting-edge solutions ,powered by AI-driven reporting, enable radiologists to work faster, smarter, and with greater precision. By addressing critical workflow inefficiencies,AGFA HealthCare and Rad AI are not just setting the industry standard in data exchange and interoperability — they are shaping the future of radiology.\n\nThe partnership's success was showcased this summer at the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) Connectathon, where AGFA HealthCare and Rad AI demonstrated their commitment to advancing healthcare technology. They became the first vendors in the industry to earn the prestigious IHE Connectathon Seal for testing and validating the use of theIntegrated Reporting Applications profile in radiology.\n\nBy adopting these open IHE standards, AGFA HealthCare and Rad AI are set to deliver improved interoperability — enhancing efficiency and helping to minimize errors.Key findings — such as measurements, image numbers, and dates — now automatically populate in Rad AI Reporting, eliminating the need for manual entry. Inefficiencies in radiology workflows contribute to stress and burnout among radiologists and the communication between radiology PACS and reporting systems has historically been limited.\n\nJohn Paulett, Chief Architect of Rad AI Reporting, highlights the significance of the strategic collaboration between AGFA HealthCare and Rad AI:\n\n\"Rad AI Reporting is designed from the ground up to be flexible and open, built around standards to provide efficient integration with other vendors and healthcare systems. The collaboration between Rad AI and AGFA HealthCare demonstrates how interoperability drives innovation. We worked closely together to integrate in record time, and the result is a connected experience the radiology community has been desiring for a long time,” Paulett stated.\n\nThe collaboration between AGFAHealthCare and Rad AI offers a seamless experience – exceeding what is traditionally thought possible between a PACS and a reporting environment.\n\n\"At AGFA’s User GroupMeeting and Rad AI’s Partner Summit, radiologists and administrators were excited by our solution, highlighting how it addresses long-standing challenges and gives radiologists back the time they need to focus on patient care — an essential benefit as growing demands continue to stretch radiology teams,\" said MarkBurgess, President, North America for AGFA HealthCare.\n\n“Open standards ensure that the time and resources, which you invest in deploying mission critical software for your health system, can evolve with your changing needs. This gives you peace of mind that you won’t need to rip and replace in the future,” said Josh Duncan, Senior VicePresident of Sales, Marketing, & Customer Success at Rad AI. “This partnership is reshaping the radiology landscape, meeting current demands and preparing for future challenges.”\n\n\"As healthcare evolves rapidly, our collaboration with Rad AI enables us to deliver flexible, connected solutions that overcome the limitations of legacy reporting integrations,\" said Rob Mayer, Chief Product Officer for AGFA HealthCare. \"By embracing an open platform strategy, AGFA HealthCare and Rad AI are driving the next phase of radiology innovation.\"\n\nAbout AGFA HealthCare\n\nAt AGFA HealthCare, we are transforming the delivery of care –supporting healthcare professionals across the globe with secure, effective, and sustainable imaging data management.

      "# [Rad AI reduces real-time inference latency by 50% using Amazon SageMaker by Ken Kao, Hasan Ali Demirci, Dmitry Soldatkin, Karan Jain on 2024-11-26](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/rad-ai-reduces-real-time-inference-latency-by-50-using-amazon-sagemaker/)\nThis post is co-written with Ken Kao and Hasan Ali Demirci from Rad AI.\n\nRad AI has reshaped radiology reporting, developing solutions that streamline the most tedious and repetitive tasks, and saving radiologists’ time. Since 2018, using state-of-the-art proprietary and open source large language models (LLMs), our flagship product—Rad AI Impressions— has significantly reduced the time radiologists spend dictating reports, by generating Impression sections.\n\nThe Impression section serves as the conclusion of a radiology report, including summarization, follow-up recommendations, and highlights of significant findings. It stands as the primary result for the clinician who ordered the study, influencing the subsequent course of the patient’s treatment. Given its pivotal role, accuracy and clarity in this section are paramount. Traditionally, radiologists dictated every word of the impressions section, creating it from scratch for each report. This time-consuming process led to fatigue and burnout, and involved redundant manual dictation in many studies.\n\nThe automation provided by Rad AI Impressions not only reduces burnout, but also safeguards against errors arising from manual repetition. It increases the capacity to generate reports, reducing health system turnaround times and making high-quality care available to more patients. Impressions are meticulously customized to each radiologist’s preferred language and style. Radiologists review and revise the output as they see fit, maintaining exact control over the final report, and Rad AI also helps radiologists catch and fix a wide variety of errors in their reports. This improves the overall quality of patient care.\n\nToday, by executing abstractive summarization tasks at scale, Rad AI’s language models generate impressions for millions of radiology studies every month, assisting thousands of radiologists at more than 40% of all US health systems and 9 of the 10 largest US radiology practices. Based on years of working with customers, we estimate that our solutions save 1 hour for every 9-hour radiology shift.\n\nOperating within the real-time radiology workflow, our product functions online around the clock, adhering to strict latency requirements. For years, Rad AI has been a reliable partner to radiology practices and health systems, consistently delivering high availability and generating complete results seamlessly in 0.5–3 seconds, with minimal latency. This efficiency empowers radiologists to achieve optimal results in their studies.\n\nIn this post, we share how Rad AI reduced real-time inference latency by 50% using Amazon SageMaker.\n\nChallenges in deploying advanced ML models in healthcare\n\nRad AI, being an AI-first company, integrates machine learning (ML) models across various functions—from product development to customer success, from novel research to internal applications. AI models are ubiquitous within Rad AI, enhancing multiple facets of the organization. It might seem straightforward to integrate ML models into healthcare workflows, but the challenges are many and interconnected.\n\nHealthcare applications make some of the usual AI complexities more challenging. Although any AI solution has to balance speed against accuracy, radiologists rely on the timeliness of our impressions to care for patients, and expect our clinical accuracy to always improve. This constant innovation requires new kinds of models and demands continually improving specialized software and hardware. As inference logic becomes more complex, composing results from multiple models (each seeing regular releases), and a streamlined and reproducible process for orchestration and management is of paramount importance. Even diagnosing basic issues, at this level of complexity, requires a deliberate and methodical approach.\n\nRad AI’s ML organization tackles this challenge on two fronts. First, it enhances researcher productivity by providing the necessary processes and automation, positioning them to deliver high-quality models with regularity. Second, it navigates operational requirements by making strategic infrastructure choices and partnering with vendors that offer both computational resources and managed services. By enhancing both researcher productivity and operational efficiency, Rad AI creates an environment that fosters ML innovation.\n\nTo succeed in this environment, Rad AI takes advantage of the availability and consistency offered by SageMaker real-time endpoints, a fully managed AI inference service that allows seamless deployment and scaling of models independently from the applications that use them. By integrating Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and SageMaker, Rad AI’s ML system forms a complex server-side architecture with numerous online components. This infrastructure enables Rad AI to navigate the complexities of real-time model deployment, so radiologists receive timely and accurate impressions.\n\nWith focused effort and strategic planning, Rad AI continues to enhance its systems and processes, ultimately improving outcomes for patients and clinicians alike.\n\nLet’s transition to exploring solutions and architectural strategies.\n\nApproaches to researcher productivity\n\nTo translate our strategic planning into action, we developed approaches focused on refining our processes and system architectures. By improving our deployment pipelines and enhancing collaboration between researchers and MLOps engineers, we streamlined the integration of models into our healthcare workflows. In this section, we discuss the practices that have enabled us to optimize our operations and advance our ML capabilities.\n\nTo enable researchers to work at full capacity while minimizing synchronization with MLOps engineers, we recognized the need for normalization in our deployment processes. The pipeline begins when researchers manage tags and metadata on the corresponding model artifact. This approach abstracts away the complexity beneath the surface and eliminates the usual ceremony involved in deploying models. By centralizing model registration and aligning practices across team members, we clamp the entry point for model deployment. This allows us to build additional tooling as we identify bottlenecks or areas for improvement.\n\nInstead of frequent synchronization between MLOps and research teams, we observe practices and identify needs as they arise. Under the hood, we employ an in-house tool combined with modular, reusable infrastructure as code to automate the creation of pull requests. No one writes any code manually. The protocol between researchers and engineers is reduced to pull request reviews, eliminating the need for circulating documents or holding alignment meetings. The declarative nature of the infrastructure code, coupled with intuitive design, answers most questions that MLOps engineers would typically ask researchers—all within the file added to the repository and pull requested.\n\nThese approaches, combined with the power and streamlining offered by SageMaker, have reduced the model deployment process to a matter of minutes after a model artifact is ready. Deploying a new model to a target environment now requires minimal effort. Only when dealing with peculiar characteristics of an architecture or specific configurations—such as adjustments for tensor parallelism—do additional considerations arise. By minimizing the complexity and time involved in deployment, we enable researchers to concentrate on innovation rather than operational hurdles.\n\nArchitectural strategies\n\nIn our architectural strategies, we aimed to achieve high performance and scalability while effectively deploying ML models. The need for low latency in inference tasks—especially critical in healthcare settings where delays can impact patient care—required architectures capable of efficiently handling both GPU-bound and CPU-bound workloads. Additionally, straightforward configuration options that allow us to quickly generate benchmarks became essential. This capability enables us to swiftly evaluate different backend engines, a necessity in latency-bound environments.\n\nIn addition to process improvements, we implemented architectural strategies to address the technical aspects. As previously mentioned, real-world inference systems often combine GPU-bound and CPU-bound inference tasks, along with the need to compose results from multiple services. This complexity is typically required for an ML organization to provide product-side functionality. We use AWS Fargate to run CPU inferences and other supporting components, usually alongside a comprehensive frontend API. This setup implements a classic architecture consisting of a frontend API and backend application services. GPU inferences are served through SageMaker real-time inference endpoints. An illustration of this architecture is provided in the following diagram.\n\nWe standardized on using SageMaker Large Model Inference (LMI) containers, maintained and offered from public Amazon repositories. These containers support several optimization frameworks and provide simple configuration delivery options. This setup is straightforward for researchers to interpret and spares them the unnecessary hassle of dealing with dependencies and compatibility issues among various ML libraries and managing the underlying container layers.\n\nDiving deeper into our architecture, we consider one of the deployment strategies used in our online inference system. On a single instance, we employ a server that schedules inference tasks with DJL Serving as the model server. This approach allows us to select from and experiment with multiple backend engines, including popular frameworks such as TensorRT-LLM and vLLM. The abstractions and built-in integration with SageMaker real-time endpoints, along with support for multi-GPU inference and tensor parallelism, enable us to quickly evaluate different backends for a given task.\n\nAs Rad AI has matured, our architectural solutions have evolved. Initially, we relied on custom components, managing our own container images and running NVIDIA Triton Server directly on instances provided by Amazon ECS. However, by migrating to SageMaker managed hosting and using instance types ranging from 1–8 GPUs of various kinds, we implemented the architectural strategies discussed earlier. Removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in building and optimizing model hosting infrastructure reduced our total cost of ownership by 50%. Optimizing the instance types and container parameters decreased latency by the same margin.\n\nWhen deploying models with SageMaker Inference, consider the following key best practices:\n\nIt’s important to build a robust model deployment pipeline that automates the process of registering, testing, and promoting models to production. This can involve integrating SageMaker with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) tools to streamline the model release process.\n\nIn terms of infrastructure choices, it’s important to right-size your SageMaker endpoints to match the expected traffic and model complexity, using features like auto scaling to dynamically adjust capacity.\n\nPerformance optimization techniques like model optimization and inference container parameter tuning can help improve latency and reduce costs.\n\nComprehensive monitoring and logging of model performance in production is critical to quickly identify and address any issues that arise.\n\nConclusion\n\nOne of the enduring challenges in healthcare is enhancing patient care on a global scale. Rad AI is committed to meeting this challenge by transforming the field of radiology. By refining our processes and implementing strategic architectural solutions, we have enhanced both researcher productivity and operational efficiency.\n\nOur deliberate approach to model deployment and infrastructure management has streamlined workflows and significantly reduced costs and latency. Every additional second saved not only increases bandwidth and reduces fatigue for the radiologists we serve, but also improves patient outcomes and benefits healthcare organizations in a variety of ways. Our inference systems are instrumental in realizing these objectives, using SageMaker’s scalability and flexibility to integrate ML models seamlessly into healthcare settings. As we continue to evolve, our commitment to innovation and excellence positions Rad AI at the forefront of AI-driven healthcare solutions.\n\nShare your thoughts and questions in the comments.\n\nReferences\n\nRad AI Impressions\n\nDeep Java Library: Large Model Inference\n\nWeights & Biases.

      "# [Products, Competitors, Financials, Employees, Headquarters Locations](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/rad-ai)\nExclusive: Google Cloud Launches Enhanced Multimodal AI, Further Fueling Healthcare AI Race\n\nFollow Author Save Article SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Google Cloud is enhancing its Vertex AI search platform for healthcare with multimodal AI capabilities. Specifically, it will be launching Visual Q&A, a new feature which will enable search through tables, charts and diagrams. Why is this important? Because healthcare, as much as it would like to be, has not comprehensively digitized yet, and patient records and information are often scattered across numerous data sources and types. In many cases, noteworthy patient information and diagnostic tables are often collected or denoted in paper format, frequently requiring manual scanning into an EMR followed by laborious data entry and analysis. In fact, a recent study cites that imaging data accounts for nearly 90% of all healthcare data—a huge source of important clinical information. The authors also discuss how while the success of AI thus far has primarily been centered around the analysis of traditional forms of big data, “medical imaging presents unique challenges that confront deep learning approaches.” Thus, this paradigm has emerged as the next frontier for many healthcare companies. With multimodal AI capabilities through Visual Q&A, clinicians can receive images and diagrams as direct inputs which will be analyzed by the tool and then be generated in search results, moving forward. For example, the image below shows an annual diabetes foot exam form, which is typically manually filled out by hand after an examination: Diabetes foot exam form that is filled out by hand. Google Cloud Previously, a clinician would have to comb the EMR system to look for the uploaded image/document and manually decipher it for results. With Visual Q&A and Vertex AI Search, the system automatically detects that the patient record shows no previous amputation and can respond to search queries, based on the uploaded document: Vertex AI Search with Visual Q&A responds to the query after analyzing the form. Google Cloud Aashima Gupta, Global Director of Healthcare Strategy & Solutions, Google Cloud, explains that AI has come really far in a lot of ways, especially in the realm of building and optimizing foundation models. But now, the technology can go even further—“to a place where care gaps can actually be meaningfully addressed.” This is where tools such as Vertex AI Search and Visual Q&A come into the picture, says Gupta: “not just to improve efficiency, but make an actual impact on patient outcomes.” Chief Medical Officer of Counterpart Health, Dr. David Tsay, M.D., explains that tools like Visual Q&A can significantly augment a provider’s workflow beyond just purely a matter of efficiency: “Providers really enjoy this experience; it is not just about saving time, but they’re now getting a more synthesized answer and better results.\" Counterpart Health is working to leverage technology and the best in AI to manage chronic diseases and improve patient outcomes, and is using Google Cloud’s Vertex AI for Healthcare platform. Given just how important imaging and documentation is for healthcare, the AI race is rapidly heating up in this space. Other large technology companies are quickly springing into action; for example, Microsoft Cloud is similarly working on multimodal capabilities, including image segmentation across radiological outputs in addition to more generalized image-to-text insights. Another formidable player is Nvidia’s Clara platform , which delves into the diagnostic space as well; Clara leverages deep learning to enable the building of medical AI applications using imaging data. Other niche companies are building robust AI platforms focused primarily on imaging; examples include RadAI , which has significant promise to reshape the radiology space. This competition has been relatively positive for the industry thus far, as it has forced the large hyper-scalers to innovate quickly and provide the best value proposition for consumers. Furthermore, every company that is working in this space has slightly different approaches and focus for their products, meaning that consumers ultimately have a healthy amount of choice for their respective ecosystem. This choice and selective adoption will assuredly fuel even more innovation by companies, should they desire to stay competitive in the swiftly changing market. As the famous adage so clearly describes, “a picture is worth a thousand words.” Now, there is increasing hope that generative AI can ensure those words are accurately and easily captured.",

The ten-year-old whistleblower-initiated Federal lawsuit charged that Walgreens violated anti-kickback statutes for Medicare and Medicaid was settled for $5 million on Tuesday. The claim was that patients at the Cook County Health & Hospital System’s Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center were induced to fill prescriptions at Walgreens’ specialty pharmacy by waiving copayments, an inducement that violated the False Claims Act. The lawsuits were filed in the Federal District Court for Northern Illinois by Sarah Castillo Baier and Rita Svendsen Baier in 2014, then by the Department of Justice and the state of Illinois filing their joint complaint four years later in 2018. The settlement will be divided between the two whistleblowers and the US and Illinois governments. This is Walgreens’ second settlement in the last month and pocket lint compared to the first; their $595 million bill for settling the $1 billion PWNHealth/Everly Health arbitration award came due at the end of February. Crain’s Chicago Business\n\nUniDoc signs agreement to buy AGNES Connect from AMD Telemedicine. The Canadian ‘doc-in-a-box’ remote virtual clinic company has agreed to acquire the AGNES Connect business line, software, and customers to its present H3HealthCube product (right). Their NEIL Connect software for the HealthCube was already built on the AGNES Connect telemedicine clinical exam platform. Interestingly, UniDoc is acquiring the use of the AMD Telemedicine name for AGNES along with related goodwill and trademarks, for which they are paying a low US $175,000 in cash plus a revenue share. The Canadian Securities Exchange may have to approve, but the closing is expected shortly. The H3Health Cube was recently placed in Italy and Ukraine [TTA 13 Feb]. Release\n\nThis week’s three launches are:\n\nKlarity Health launches Kiwi Health. Telehealth and independent private practice management platform Klarity Health’s new Kiwi Health is designed as an an all-in-one marketing and communications tool. It provides practices with SaaS tools to set up and promote an online presence in 30+ clinical directories, professional website management, patient intake and scheduling, a patient portal, loyalty, and engagement. Klarity has operations in 40 states with practices serving over 100,000 patients while retaining 94.3% of its doctors–all on a slim raise of $12.5 million. Release\n\nTunstall Healthcare UK introduces Communicall Digital. This fully digital warden call system is designed for supported housing and retirement communities including extra care environments. It enables residents not only to summon assistance through its alarm feature, but also to manage door entry and room-to-room video calls through a simple touchscreen system. The system also reports resident activity to care staff through the Central Management Platform. It is fully compliant with the UK’s digital transition requirements to the industry-standard BS8521-2 (NOW-IP) protocol. THIIS\n\nIreland’s Ministry of Health launches the Health Service Executive (HSE) Health App. The initial release will enable Irish residents to access and store their health information including self-declared medications; view a list of medicines received through the Irish Drugs Payment Scheme or Medical Card Scheme; their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC); their medical Long-term Illness (LTI), Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS) and GP Visit cards; flu and COVID-19 vaccination records; maternity service appointments, and information on HSE services. Additional features will be rolled out during 2025. Ireland Department of Health release\n\nMeanwhile, clinicians and their leadership stand waaaay far apart on burnout and workplace mental health. A study from VITAL WorkLife, a mental health provider for healthcare workforces including physicians and nurses, finds that there’s a Grand Canyon of a perceptual gap between clinicians and healthcare employer leadership.\n\n79% of clinicians feel unsupported — while 95% of leaders believe they are addressing healthcare worker burnout\n\n80% of clinicians believe that it’s urgent to address to address mental health challenges in their organization–but only half of the leadership agree\n\nOver 70% of clinicians believe that their leadership considers organizational mental health a low-priority issue\n\n98% of healthcare leadership believe that they make workplace mental health a priority, while only 39% of clinicians agree–and believe that organizational performance is far more their concern.\n\n92% of healthcare leadership believe that existing programs are well tailored to organizational needs–but only 16% of clinicians agree. 33% disagree and an addition 51% find themselves in the ‘middle’.\n\nThe online survey of 210 healthcare professionals across the US was taken over a three-week period in January 2025, with a cross-section of healthcare functions including leadership level medical, nursing, HR, and wellness staff, as well as clinicians. The full survey is available for download at this link. Release\n\nThese just in: drug compounders sue FDA over semaglutide scarcity removal; Sycamore’s Walgreens buy plans begin to show\n\nWhat the telehealth prescribers can’t do, the compounders are. A major drug compounder association, the Outsourcing Facilities Association, along with member North American Custom Laboratories, LLC, both based in Texas, filed suit yesterday (24 February) against the FDA to vacate the final action removing semaglutide, the active ingredient in GLP-1 drugs, from the shortage list. The FDA announced that it was being removed from the shortage list effective April-May, after months of compounders legally creating semaglutide-based weight loss drugs as permitted during the shortage. This was certainly good news for Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical company that developed and markets Ozempic and Wegovy [TTA 25 Feb].\n\nThe compounding was a boon for telehealth providers such as Hims and Hers, Ro, 23andMe (Lemonaid), Future Health, Weight Watchers, Lark, and many others. It allowed them to customize injectable formulations for customers on weight loss programs at a far lower cost than standard branded products. The FDA allows this only during times of shortage (compounded by Section 503A pharmacies and Section 503B outsourcing facilities as “essential copies” of FDA-approved drugs). Exceptions are also made if the standard drug is in some way inappropriate for the patient who then medically requires a customized version, e.g. with adjusted dosage, method of dosing, or added/deleted ingredients, but these are not ‘mass’ circumstances or situations.\n\nAmong the grounds presented in the suit against the FDA are that the shortage is still going on with delays in prescription filling, leading to patient harm; that FDA’s delisting was arbitrary without the required notice with public comment nor was it published in the Federal Register; and that it is ‘arbitrary and capricious’. Novo Nordisk has admitted publicly that supply constraints could still exists.\n\nContinued ‘customization’ is vital to telehealth prescribers’ revenue, while branding is vital to the pharmaceutical developers undercut by compounding. In 2024, Hims alone earned $225 million in revenue from compounded semaglutide and other GLP-1 type drugs. Both Novo Nordisk and Lilly (Zepbound) have pushed back on the compounders on safety and risk, along with lower prices in new delivery types such as vials versus autoinjectors.\n\nThe suit was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Biopharma Dive\n\nMore intriguing details if Sycamore Partners takes Walgreens Boots Alliance private. Financial Times reported via Reuters that according to the usual “people familiar with the matter”, Sycamore’s plan is to separate WBA into three parts, like Gaul: US retail pharmacy, Boots UK, and US Healthcare (VillageMD, CareCentrix, and Shields Health Solutions). They would have distinct capital structures. There’s minimal information beyond that. Sycamore is not expected to have difficulty financing the take-private, and WBA chairman Stefano Pessina is expected to have an ownership stake. The news drove WBA shares up today about 5% and 10% in the last five days. But the news seems to be moving along. VillageMD’s on the market is assumed but it is not certain any sale would complete in time. Crain’s Chicago Business\n\nThis Just In: Walgreens settles PWNHealth/Everly Health arbitration award for $595 million, reduced from $1 billion\n\nA golden bird in the hand for PWN/Everly–and presaging something else for Walgreens? Walgreens has decided to settle with PWN/Everly the latter’s recently upheld near-$1 billion arbitration award for $595 million, about 60%. This amount is payable to Everly in a breathtaking two business days.\n\nThe arbitration between PWN/Everly and Walgreens charged Walgreens with breach of contract on their Covid-19 testing services agreement, adding in additional violations of the Latham Act on trademarks and more. The arbitrator’s award of $987 million last March was affirmed by the US District Court for the District of Delaware on 11 February. Walgreens declared it would appeal but stated in their SEC filing that any resolution might take up to two years. More details: TTA 12 Feb\n\nWas this a ‘Deal Deal’ as a prelude to a more significant endgame for Walgreens? For this Editor strictly speculating, Walgreens not appealing but settling this quickly, agreeing to pay a reduced amount in record time, may point to something larger. If coupled with the speculated revival of the Sycamore Partners buyout deal [TTA 19 Feb], if Walgreens is actively in sale mode, they want to be as attractive as possible. That means taking off the table ongoing lawsuits and pending settlements that are future obligations–presenting the cleanest picture possible of and reducing their Mound of Misery. Where they can, like with Everly, it’s settling for less now, versus dragging out an appeal for two years that will be more costly to litigate, for example in legal fees and award interest, if almost certainly upheld again. These become future obligations for a buyer and make for more unattractiveness. It also follows on VillageMD/CityMD’s recent settlements with New York State and the Department of Justice [TTA 12 Feb] and state-level opioid settlements, though in January the DOJ filed a civil lawsuit against Walgreens on opioids and other meds violating the Controlled Substances Act [TTA 24 Jan] . Reuters, Crain’s Chicago Business\n\n“It’s alive!” Walgreens’ deal with Sycamore Partners may be back on the table: report\n\nResuscitated, according to Tuesday reports. CNBC’s David Faber, currently co-anchor of CNBC’s morning “Squawk on the Street”, said Tuesday (yesterday) that the take-private deal of Walgreens Boots Alliance by Sycamore Partners and possibly other entities, has gone from “dead” to “alive” in his books.\n\nThe Walgreens deal was reported, but called “rumors and speculation” by Walgreens in December right before the Christmas blackout [TTA 10 Dec 2024, 8 Jan]. It withered like sycamores do in a cold 2025 winter, when Walgreens piled up Heaping Helpings of Misery in the following weeks: January FY25 results, suspending its dividend, and arbitration awards, civil settlements, and penalties.\n\nYet…a little-noted report local to Chicago noted that as of January’s end, Sycamore had been approaching private credit firms trying to put together debt financing for a deal. Whether this was for WBA or another deal is unknown. But Sycamore is no newcomer to this. Crain’s Chicago Business\n\nThere isn’t much (right now) beyond Mr. Faber’s call in the news coverage, and certainly no comments by either WBA or Sycamore. But his show and his persona–a 30+ year veteran of CNBC known for his insider savvy and calls–are influential enough to drive the stock up a dollar from $9.70 to $10.98 on Tuesday. The price lingers on through today at $10.86.\n\nWhat also lingers? The sheer difficulty of Sycamore pulling off a complicated and pricey deal with WBA. It is not one of the VC elite with a ton of money from limited partners aching to invest. But what it has is a track record in putting together complex deals and saving debt-ridden retailers before, notably with Staples in 2017 and more recently Chicos FAS and Playa Bowls. Its focus is retail and e-commerce, making it an odd (but not too odd) partner for Walgreens. It might be interested in kicking up a downsized retail operation and in Boots’ thriving retail/e-commerce business in the UK, leaving the healthcare/VillageMD, pharmacy, and PBM ownership to others. It’s led to speculation that their interest might be a cherry-pick as part of a breakup team. But, as mariners know, the wise sailor knows that it’s any port in a storm. Crain’s Chicago Business, Yahoo! Business\n\nThis just in: New York State nicks Walgreens’/VillageMD’s CityMD for $14M+ in refunds, canceled debt on improper Covid-19 billing\n\nHere’s a few more inches added to Walgreens’ Mound of Misery. New York State’s Office of the Attorney General found that CityMD, now part of Walgreens’ VillageMD, improperly billed patients for Covid-19 tests. The $14 million total consisted of canceling $7 million in outstanding testing bills for over 87,000 patients plus refunds of about $7 million to over 215,000 patients who already paid. The CityMD tests were performed between March 2020 and November 2022. Many of the patients received billing up to two years after date of service, with added billing for late charges. In addition, CityMD will pay $95,000 in penalties to the State of New York for the improper billing with an additional fine of $5,000 per incident for any further billing.\n\nFederal and state laws during the Covid-19 public health emergency prohibited providers and health plans from charging co-pays and deductibles for medically necessary Covid-19 testing and related services. CityMD’s website and staff stated that there would be no out-of-pocket costs for testing. There was also no posted cash price for services, violating NYS law. CityMD also refused to correct bills for individuals with previously issued billing. NYSOAG press release\n\nThis follows a $12 million June 2024 civil settlement with the US Department of Justice in the District of New Jersey on false payment claims for Covid-19 testing. The $12.04 million settlement under the False Claims Act resolves CityMD’s claims submitted from 4 February 2020 through 5 April 2022 to the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA)’s Uninsured Program that covered testing, treatment, and vaccination costs, reimbursing providers at generally Medicare rates. CityMD did not adequately verify that these individuals had health insurance coverage before submitting their claims to the Uninsured Program, including but not limited to individuals for whom CityMD had health insurance cards on file. This then caused downstream filings by labs claiming Uninsured Program payments based on CityMD information. The settlement includes a $2 million whistleblower payment under the False Claims Act to Steven Kitzinger, a patient of CityMD, who informed the clinic that he was fully insured but was told that CityMD would delete his insurance information. He separately sued CityMD. This will at least cover his legal costs ;-) CityMD was credited by the DOJ for their voluntary disclosure, cooperation, and remediation. Healthcare Dive, US Attorney’s Office NJ release\n\nTo be fair, both incidents of improper and fraudulent billing occurred while CityMD was owned by Summit Medical, before Summit’s acquisition by VillageMD, with a Walgreens investment, announced in the palmy days of November 2022 and closing 3 January 2023. But it will be Walgreens doing the payouts where applicable.\n\nWalgreens’ misery level rises some more: Federal court affirms $987M award to PWNHealth/Everly Health. Plus selling $295M in Cencora shares, drawing down to 6%.\n\nWalgreens’ Mound of Misery grows ever higher in two more ways. The US District Court for the District of Delaware ruled yesterday that last year’s arbitration award of $987 million to PWNHealth stands.\n\nWalgreens originally contracted exclusively with PWNHealth’s Everly Health Solutions’ telehealth physician network in April 2020 to order Covid-19 tests that consumers requested through the Walgreens website. PWN/Everly had, with its network, the ability to administer nationwide Covid-19 testing including labs and follow-up. However, Walgreens in 2021 started to divert tests to their own pharmacists, while continuing to use the Everly trademarked logo and displaying that testing would be done by PWN/Everly’s network. This breached the exclusive Master Services Agreement (MSA) with PWN/Everly. Walgreens terminated the MSA effective 1 June 2022. PWN/Everly on 10 June 2022 then initiated the arbitration with the American Arbitration Association alleging breach of contract, a violation of the Latham Act on trademarks, plus additional breaches and violations. In March 2024, the arbitrator awarded PWN/Everly $987 million. This was 12 times the contractually specified $79 million in damages. Arbitration text and decision in Jus Mundi\n\nImmediately after the arbitration, Walgreens filed suit in Delaware to vacate the ruling on the grounds that it contravened the contract’s cap on damages and that the arbitrator’s decision was “egregious and improper”.\n\nThe Federal judge in yesterday’s decision upheld the arbitration decision, finding that the arbitrator had the authority to interpret the contractual language and determine damages. The judge found no evidence that the arbitrator exceeded his authority or showed bias. Walgreens is, of course, appealing the decision in the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In its Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, Walgreens stated that it disagrees with the court ruling but that the appeal may take another two years. “There can be no assurances as to the outcome”. PWNHealth, of course, is “pleased with the court’s well-reasoned decision confirming the arbitration award.” Reuters, Crain’s Chicago Business, FierceHealthcare\n\nWalgreens needs some fast cash. One investment that they have been gradually cashing out is their interest in Cencora, a drug distributor originally called Amerisource Bergen. Last Thursday’s drawdown involved Cencora repurchasing about $50 million worth of its stock from Walgreens, with Walgreens selling about $265 million worth of additional shares. Deducting $20 million in early settlement fees, the net proceeds were $295 million. Walgreens (WBA) states that it will be used primarily for debt paydown and general corporate purposes. WBA’s stake in Cencora has been reduced to 6% from the earlier 10%. Walgreens has been steadily cashing out its Cencora interest with three sales in 2024 totaling 5% of shares [TTA 7 July 2024]. Release, Healthcare Dive, Crain’s Chicago Business\n\nGiven January’s Department of Justice (DOJ) civil suit over improper dispensing of opioids and and other unlawful medications over more than a decade, with possible penalties in the billions, Walgreens’ Mound of Misery is approaching Chicago’s Willis Tower (the former Sears Tower) heights.\n\nThe table stacks–and clears: fundings for RadAI $60M, The Helper Bees $35M, Bicycle Health $16.5M. Walgreens suspends stock dividends after 91 years. And has Transcarent zeroed out 98point6? (updated)\n\nFebruary is the real opening of the New Year’s Casino. Investors place their bets–and the dealer’s stick clears the losers.\n\nRadAI’s Series C racks up $60 million. The generative AI radiology company gained an oversubscribed round led by Transformation Capital, with participation from existing investors Khosla Ventures, World Innovation Lab, UP2398, Kickstart Fund, OCV Partners, Cone Health and others. It follows a $50 million Series B in May 2024 and boosts the company’s value to $525 million. RadAI’s two products to speed radiology workflows and findings are Rad AI Impressions, their first product, and Continuity for interpretation and follow up for potential new cancers. RadAI claims that their platforms are used by radiologists performing about 50% of all US medical imaging. In July 2024, it partnered with Bayer to bring its capability to Bayer’s Calantic Digital Solution customers. Release, Mobihealthnews\n\nThe niftily named The Helper Bees nabbed $35 million in a Series C. This was a tidy amount for the formerly unsexy independent aging technology sector, led by Centana Growth Partners, with support from Silverton Partners, Impact Engine, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures, and Alumni Ventures. The Austin, Texas-based company works through 43 health plans (payers) by providing national access to non-medical products and services such as in-home caregiving, home modifications, groceries and meals, pest control, housekeeping, lawn care, and transportation, closing significant care gaps in senior care and enabling aging in place. They support long-term care plans and Medicare Advantage. Their total funding is $54 million. Release, Mobihealthnews\n\nBicycle Health pedals to a $16.5 million raise, profitability. Bicycle’s telehealth platform for opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment has had its downs (a May 2024 layoff of 15% of staff) and ups (a $50 million Series B in 2022). Their latest up is turning profitable on an EBIT­DA and net in­come ba­sis as of Q4. In the middle is the just-announced unlettered down round led by existing investor Questa Capital, with participation from all other existing investors including SignalFire, Frist Cressey Ventures, City Light Capital, InterAlpen Partners, Valeo Ventures, and Hustle Fund, as well as new investor JSL Health. Added to the C-level roster are CFO Manu Kuppalli and COO Andy Thomas, with a background in brick-and-mortar behavioral health. Release, Endpoints, Mobihealthnews\n\nOn the loser’s side of the table\n\nWalgreens suspends their quarterly dividend for the first time in 91 years. The rationale for ending the shareholder payments made since 1933 was announced late last Thursday “as management continues to evaluate and refine its capital allocation policy consistent with the company’s broader long-term turnaround efforts”. The admission was blunt: “The company’s cash needs over the next several years, including with respect to litigation and debt refinancing, were important considerations as part of the decision to suspend the dividend.” The share price promptly took a hit going from $11.43 at market close on Thursday to closing today (Tuesday) at $9.84, not exactly a desired result. Walgreens’ days as a ‘widows and orphans stock’ are long over.\n\nThe litigation is a serious matter, with the Department of Justice (DOJ) filing a civil suit 16 January in Illinois over improper dispensing of opioids and other unlawful medications over more than a decade, in violation of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).\n\nThe WBA Q3, announced mid-January, widened its net loss to $265 million.\n\nWalgreens is in the midst of closing 1,200 locations to get out from under real estate.\n\nThe rest is not much different than other retail–in-store theft, pharmacy sales erosion, and retail sales going online or elsewhere.\n\nMistakes such as buying VillageMD (and doubling down with Summit Health and CityMD) made it 10x worse.\n\nWill this put the brakes on a sale? Certainly Sycamore Partners and other interested parties now must rethink their pricing and timing, though it may be positive if it improves WBA’s cash position. [TTA 10 Dec 2024, 8 January] Release, CNBC, AP\n\nDid Transcarent, after paying $100 million for 98point6’s virtual care platform in 2023, just pull the plug on the service? This tidbit from a commenter on HIStalk News 2/5/25 indicates that Transcarent may have. Exhibit 1 is a notice from Allegheny College (PA), a service customer for about two years, on their blog that students and staff were notified on 19 December that the service was going out of business. The college is searching for a replacement telehealth service. The Allegheny page is also showing up high in Google Search results.\n\nTranscarent has a live 98point6 page with FAQs about the service and buttons for downloads on Google’s and Apple’s respective App Stores. There is no notice on Transcarent’s 98point6 page, but their last blog posting mentioning 98point6 was October 2024. On Google’s App Store, the last update is listed as 5 June 2024, which is unusual for a telehealth app. The app ownership is credited to Transcarent so it is not a leftover from the original company. According to the HIStalk commenter, most staff was laid off by April 2024. (As we reported in our 8 May 2024 report, 98point6 had only 100 on staff, and the number of those laid off was unknown.)\n\nConfusing matters is that 98point6 continues as a platform, but not as a telehealth service. After they sold their virtual care service to Transcarent [TTA 9 Mar 2023], they announced a pivot into licensing its real-time and asynchronous software to third parties, including Transcarent. Less than a year later, 98point6 bought the remaining assets of telehealth provider Bright.md not sold to Evernorth’s MDLIVE–17 asynchronous telehealth provider customers [TTA 19 Jan 2024]. We have reached out to Transcarent’s press office for confirmation. They are welcome to reach out to TTA (email Editor Donna). Update: as of 14 February, there has been no response from their corporate communications folks.\n\nUpdates: ATA on telehealth policy priorities, UHG investor group demands denied care report, DOJ sues Walgreens on illegal Rx dispensing, VA nominee supports Oracle EHR deployment, RFK Jr. HHS nomination hits Senate\n\nATA urges nine telehealth priorities for the Trump Administration’s consideration. Acknowledging that HHS expanded Medicare telehealth flexibilities at the start of the pandemic in 2020 in the previous Trump Administration, the American Telemedicine Association’s list is long and detailed.\n\n#1 was to withdraw last week’s Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) proposed rule, “Special Registration for Telemedicine and Limited State Telemedicine Registrations”. This would create a framework for the remote prescribing of controlled substances that in ATA’s view, would create “untenable restrictions and significant barriers to care”.\n\nThe remaining eight include flexibilities that were part of the 2020 rules.\n\nPermanently Allow for the Remote Prescribing of Controlled Substances\n\nWork with Congress to Make Permanent the Medicare Telehealth Flexibilities\n\nEnsure Affordable Telehealth Services for the Commercially Insured\n\nEnsure Affordable Telehealth Coverage for Part-Time, Contracted Workers Who Don’t Qualify for Health Care Coverage\n\nEnsure All Provider Home Addresses Remain Confidential\n\nExpand the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program\n\nReinstate Virtual Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation Programs\n\nRelease Updated Regulatory Guidance on Medicare Telehealth Flexibilities\n\nAdditional details are in the ATA Action letter to President Trump and Vice-President Vance and the ATA release.\n\nAn institutional investor interest group demands a report on delayed and denied care from UnitedHealth Group. This takes the form of a proposal for the 2025 proxy that the UHG board of directors prepare a report on these practices that create increased costs and ‘macroeconomic risks’. The proxy is usually filed in April for a meeting that is typically in June. UHG will respond at that time it files the proxy.\n\nThe group proposing the report is the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR). ICCR represents 300 faith-based institutional investors, such as asset managers, pension funds, and foundations, with over $4 trillion in invested capital. This institutional shareholder action is in the aftermath of the Brian Thompson assassination, which revealed widespread consumer anger about UnitedHealthcare’s practices in high rates of claims denials, including their use of AI in the review process, and prior authorizations to restrict utilization. UHG ignores this at its peril. By the time proxies are released and the shareholder meeting occurs in June, the trial of the assassin may be underway, putting this issue back in top news. ICCR release, Healthcare Dive\n\nWalgreens’ Mound of Misery gained a few hundred cubic yards with a lawsuit filed 16 January by the Department of Justice (DOJ) over improper dispensing of opioids and and other unlawful medications over more than a decade. The civil lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleges that Walgreens and subsidiaries dispensed millions of unlawful prescriptions, violating the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Since Walgreens then sought reimbursement from Federal healthcare programs, they violated the False Claims Act (FCA). The time frame is from August 2012 to the present. Specific allegations include that Walgreens pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions despite clear ‘red flags’, in excessive quantities, and lacking a legitimate medical purpose and that they ignored the pharmacists and their own internal data. One of the red flags were prescriptions for the ‘trinity’ of an opioid, a benzodiazepine and a muscle relaxant. There are also four different whistleblower actions against Walgreens under the qui tam (on behalf of the government) provisions of the FCA that have been consolidated. If successful, Walgreens could face civil penalties of up to $80,850 for each unlawful prescription filled in violation of the CSA, plus treble damages and applicable penalties for each prescription paid by Federal programs in violation of the FCA. Timing and Walgreens’ response are not yet available. This lawsuit could be a massive stumbling block to the rumored Walgreens/WBA sale. DOJ release, Healthcare Finance\n\nThe VA Secretary nominee recommits to resuming the 2026 rollout of the Oracle Cerner EHR. Former House Representative for Georgia Doug Collins told members of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee at his nomination hearing Tuesday that he would look at the Oracle Cerner EHR deployment with ‘fresh eyes’ and that “there’s no reason in the world we cannot get this done.” On 20 December, the VA formally stated that they were starting planning now for deployment in four Michigan facilities — Ann Arbor, Battle Creek, Detroit, and Saginaw–for implementation by mid-2016. He was critical of what has transpired to date in the limited deployment as ‘not acceptable’ and pointing out that VA facilities needed modernization of their computer systems. But perhaps a little overoptimistically, he’d like to see a faster implementation in 2016, though it should be done properly and not rushed. NextGov/FCW, Healthcare IT News\n\nAnd in the Warp Speed World that is now DC, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled to testify next Wednesday (29 January) before the Senate Finance Committee on his nomination as Health and Human Services Secretary. At HHS, he would supervise the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He has promised major reforms including food safety and chemical additives, as well as the relationships between FDA and pharmaceutical companies. Healthcare Dive Meanwhile, during the transition, HHS froze external communications or work-related appearances by staff. This is fairly standard procedure until review procedures are set up, but apparently no one planned for this in advance. This has derailed two conferences (AFCEA HIT Summit and the HHS Industry Summit) that were scheduled for this month and February. Exceptions to this are ‘mission critical’ and emergency communications. NextGov/FCW\n\nWalgreens’ kicks off FY 2025 with a wider net loss of $265M; shares rise 25% as closures, sales, and cost-cutting continue\n\nWalgreens kicked off their FY 2025 on a sad trombone note–yet Mr. Market liked the music. In one of those contradictions that only make sense to Wall Street, Walgreens’s Q1 2025 earnings report, ending 30 Nov 2024 that reported last Friday, was dismal by any reading–but seemed hopeful to market makers who lifted the shares by over 25% as of midday 14 January.\n\nUS retail pharmacy sales and operating losses were the main drags on WBA’s results.\n\nFirst, the highlights from the earnings release:\n\nOperating loss was $245 million, versus $39 million in Q1 2024. The increased loss was due to lower US retail sales and lapping prior year sale-leaseback gains. Another driver was the US Retail Pharmacy Footprint Optimization Program, unexplained in the release.\n\nNet loss was $265 million, versus $67 million in Q1 2024, driven by operating losses.\n\nIt was a dismal quarter for US Pharmacy, which includes the retail stores, despite gains in pharmacy sales of 10.4% due to drug inflation. Retail sales (the front end of the store) decreased 6.2%.\n\nA bright spot was US Healthcare, which includes VillageMD, CareCentrix, and Shields, had a smaller operating loss of $325 million, versus same quarter in FY 2024’s $436 million. VillageMD sales increased 9%, CareCentrix increased 16% and Shields increased 30%.\n\nAnother bright spot was Boots UK’s performance. Their ‘comparable’ pharmacy sales increased 10.9% versus prior year, retail sales 8.1 percent% and grew across all categories. Boots.com sales–22% of total retail sales–were up 30% boosted by Black Friday.\n\nSo why did Mr. Market kvell over this and immediately boost the same shares that fell 63% in 2024? Mostly from the earnings call with CEO Tim Wentworth and other C-levels:\n\nResults beat the Street estimates (LSEG survey):\n\nEarnings per share: 51 cents adjusted vs. 37 cents expected\n\nRevenue: $39.46 billion vs. $37.36 billion expected\n\nGuidance for FY 2025 estimates adjusted earnings per share at $1.40 to $1.80 per share with revenue in the $150 billion range.\n\nCEO Tim Wentworth confirmed that retail locations will continue to close and will accelerate. 70 were closed in Q1 2025.\n\nTheir goal is to close 1,200 locations from 2024 through 2026, with 450 to 500 underperforming locations to shutter in 2025. Walgreens currently has around 8,500 retail locations.\n\nThe sale of VillageMD is underway but no potential acquirers were mentioned on the call. Separately for Summit Health and CityMD, Walgreens is considering “best options” such as sale or restructuring. These units were snapped up by VillageMD in January 2023.\n\nThey are working to turn around retail sales which are declining due to consumers restricting spending due to inflation and the value in using online retailers.\n\nOne measure is around labor scheduling being redesigned to improve the in-store experience. Walgreens is launching a new scheduling model in about 200 locations based on store demand patterns.\n\nIn pharmacy, they plan to roll out digital and virtual check-in for patients plus micro-fulfillment centers for prescription processing.\n\nInterestingly, Walgreens in the US is not promoting online sales–unlike Boots UK which has done well with it.\n\nThere was no comment on the reported consideration of sale to a private equity (PE) firm such as Sycamore Partners [TTA 10 Dec 2024, 8 January], which would remove it from the NYSE.\n\nStreet analysts are boosting the stock now, but state that they need to see a few more quarters of stable performance to feel more confident about WBA’s future. Whether that will happen and that the US retail/pharmacy picture improves is to be determined. HIStalk, CNBC, FierceHealthcare, Healthcare Dive\n\nNews roundup #2: why Walgreens is considering selling to a PE, December fundings, 2024’s surprises, M&A ’25 predictions, Transcarent buying Accolade for $621M\n\nWhy would Walgreens sell out to a private equity investor, reportedly Sycamore Partners? This news leaked early in December to the Wall Street Journal that this PE would either buy Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) in whole, in parts, or with partners [TTA 10 Dec 2024]. This MedCityNews article gathers the speculation from multiple financial executives, and the answer is a resounding Maybe.\n\nPrimary care was a losing bet–and their retail pharmacies are challenged by new models like Amazon Pharmacy and Cost Plus.\n\nIt will take about $9.2 to $10 billion, which is a lot for Sycamore to pony up. But it’s a bargain from what PE giant KKR offered in 2019– $70 billion.\n\nSycamore may have competition for buying WBA.\n\nThe 12,000 store network is now seen not as an asset, but a liability, not only for pharmacy but also for retail goods.\n\nSycamore may be more interested in the retail and e-commerce sides of Walgreens versus healthcare. For instance, WBA company Boots in the UK has leveraged its beauty business to nearly the prominence of health in their stores.\n\nA private company may have more power to swiftly make the changes that Walgreens needs, versus a company having to report quarterly to shareholders.\n\nThere was the usual rush to announce fundings by December’s end, a refreshing change from 2023’s end. MedCityNews helpfully rounded up five of the last-minute closings:\n\nAlready noted: Oura’s $200 million plus funding for a Series D from Dexcom ($75 million) and Fidelity Management. Our earlier reporting noted total financing at $223 million and the valuation at $5 billion.\n\nCleerly’s $106 million Series C led by Insight Partners. Cleerly developed AI-assisted detailed phenotyping of coronary artery disease.\n\nRemodel Health gained $100 million in a funding led by Oak HC/FT and Hercules Capital. Remodel works with employers and employees to build and access Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement (ICHRA) plans.\n\nCala Health raised $50 million from Vertex Growth Fund and Nexus NeuroTech Ventures. Cala is a bioelectronic medicine company which developed FDA-cleared, noninvasive devices for hand tremors.\n\nSoda Health’s $50 million Series B, led by General Catalyst, is in the hot sector of ‘food as medicine’. Soda provides a ‘smart benefits’ card to use at approved retailers for food, health products, and pharmacy benefits.\n\n2024 had its share of surprises in this two-part Mobihealthnews roundup. No surprise for our Readers in that GLP-1 drugs for weight loss went to radioactive-level hot (but this Editor predicts a collapse in 2025). The failure of retail clinics such as Walmart Health and VillageMD surprised many in the industry–as well as Optum shuttering its telehealth business. Developing: menopause and autoimmune health (and their relationship)–and food as medicine. On the insurance side, the troubles of the Medicare Advantage health plan model multiplied, not moderated. And AI? On top of everything, but you maybe shouldn’t develop your own LLM. Part One, Part Two\n\nPredictions for 2025 mergers and acquisitions center on consolidations. There’s little foo-foo or froth in this Mobihealthnews article– instead, lots of New Reality. Many pandemic-born startups will die quiet deaths in sales, shotgun marriages, and shutdowns. Much caution in any M&A. The emphasis is on interoperability, which is widely defined as acquirer-acquiree and a clearly presented integrated value proposition to customers. Their industry leader panel cannot agree whether M&A will accelerate as a result of changes at FTC (Lina Khan’s departure and a new chair) or slow down. And at least one leader believes that Medicare Advantage will stabilize and recover.\n\nBut one buyer plays it high and wide in ’25–the deep-pocketed Transcarent, agreeing to buy Accolade for $621 million in 2025’s First Big Deal. Accolade is also in enterprise care navigation, as well as providing virtual primary care, specialist consultations, and patient advocates. It went public on Nasdaq in 2020. Transcarent’s offer is $7.03 per share in cash, an approximately 110% premium over the company’s closing stock price yesterday 7 January. The funding is coming from General Catalyst (!) and Glen Tullman’s 62 Ventures. Accolade will go private at the closing, expected to be Q2 following shareholder and regulatory approvals, and be integrated into Transcarent. The combined Transcarent will have 1,400 employer and payer clients. Release, Healthcare Dive\n\nBreaking: Walgreens in talks to sell out to PE Sycamore Partners\n\nThe other shoe drops. Clunk. Walgreens Boots Alliance is in talks to sell to private equity firm Sycamore Partners, according to the proverbial “people familiar with the matter” speaking with the Wall Street Journal. The deal could close as early next year.\n\nWBA would exit public markets, where it is currently trading at a little over $10 for a market capitalization just short of $9 billion. Shares rose abruptly at about 1pm Eastern Time (NY).\n\nIt is quite a fall from its value even five years ago at close to $60/share. Other factors are their acquisition binge of latter years including Shields Health and VillageMD, as well as declining brick-and-mortar store sales.\n\nAccording to the article, it would be a very large apple for Sycamore Partners to eat and digest. Sycamore has an aggregate committed capital of approximately $10 billion according to Transacted. It would be likely that some parts of the present Walgreens and WBA would be sold off or partners would be invited in, according to the WSJ’s ‘people familiar…’.\n\nThe house cleaning promised by CEO Tim Wentworth is coming to pass, fast, undoubtedly spurred by Stefano Pessina.\n\nWalgreens is slated to report its next quarterly results on 9 January.\n\nHat tip to Endpoints. One of their reporters contacted Walgreens and received this response: “We don’t comment on rumors or speculation about our business.” a Walgreens spokesperson told Endpoints News.\n\nThis story is developing.\n\nVillageMD’s co-founder/CEO resigns as Walgreens continues the brush-off after billions in losses\n\nWalgreens’ disposition of VillageMD clarifies with CEO/co-founder/board chair Tim Barry’s sudden and unceremonious departure. The news dropped on Wednesday 27 November, directly into the media black hole of the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nA tell-tale sign is that Walgreens’ board has appointed only an interim, VillageMD’s chief operating officer Jim Murray. It is not clear from company statements made to media if Mr. Murray will replace Mr. Barry on the board.\n\nMr. Murray was appointed only last April, having nearly all his experience on the insurance side. He retired from Centene in late March, having come aboard after being COO at Magellan Health when Centene acquired it (now mostly sold off) and with 28 years previously at Humana. [TTA 10 Apr and release] This may suit Mr. Murray, given his age at about 70 (from Centene regulatory filings).\n\nIn a statement to the Chicago Tribune, a Walgreens spokesperson said that “We look forward to continuing to partner with Jim Murray as he assumes day-to-day leadership responsibilities.” (Editor Donna–as if a COO does not already have day-to-day leadership responsibilities?) Murray has been “integral in helping lead the company’s turnaround as VillageMD makes meaningful progress and positions itself for profitable growth.” Neither the Walgreens representative nor VillageMD spokesperson Molly Lynch answered media questions about why Mr. Barry left or the circumstances behind the sudden departure without even a fig leaf (or pumpkin pie) of a cover story or the usual ‘thanks for your service’–which leads to more questions and doubts about What Really Happened.\n\nThe larger picture of sinking Walgreens financials. They closed FY 2024 with an operating loss of over $14 billion, more than doubling FY 2023’s loss of $6.9 billion versus FY 2022’s profit of $1.4 billion during the pandemic. $12.7 billion of a total $13.4 billion impairment was due to VillageMD’s loss in value due to clinic closures, slow patient panel growth, and downward trends in Medicare reimbursement. The remainder of about $332 million was attributed to loss of value in the CareCentrix home care unit (Form 10-K 10 October 2024, document page 123; impairments page 97; also TTA 28 Mar)\n\nThe Big Idea of combining primary care with retail locations in the Roz Brewer/WBA’s Stefano Pessina vision (hallucination?) was a major misstep into a Big Hole.\n\nBad timing was one factor. VillageMD added to a mound of miseries in retail and pharmacy sales caving, competition from direct vendors such as Amazon and Mark Cuban Cost Plus, plus traditional brick-and-mortar CVS and Walmart. There were also expensive settlements around opioid prescribing. VillageMD also tapped Walgreens for $3.5 billion to acquire Summit Medical and CityMD–and defaulted on a $2.25 billion loan in August.\n\nJoining primary care clinics with retail footprints wasn’t based on testing consumer behavior and acceptance–or practice reality. The plan was to have 1,000 joint locations modeled on the picture above left by 2027. As a model, it depended on obtaining both sufficient providers and building loyal patient panels, a slow pull if there ever was one. Physically adding clinic locations to Walgreens’ stores proved to be both expensive and difficult.\n\nThese factors and others sank Roz Brewer’s CEO-dom, the share price, and the vision of Mr. Barry’s and VillageMD’s founders and physicians. The last dated back to 2013 and built into a network of hundreds of freestanding primary care clinics in value-based care. Many of the 140+ closures starting early this year were not only of expansions, but also of long-standing VillageMD offices, including in its core market of Chicago metro. Earlier this year, Cigna wrote off most of its $2.5 billion investment, throwing its Q1 into the red [TTA 2 May].\n\nMany of the practices participated successfully in CMS’ advanced ACO shared savings models starting in 2016 such as Next Generation, Direct Contracting, and the current ACO REACH. The practices integrated telehealth as part of their value-based care models to achieve quality metrics. In CY 2023, VillageMD-operated ACO entities in the REACH model achieved $140 million in gross savings for Medicare, with $36 million shared back with the government and the remainder reinvested in the care model. (CMS reports are released 10-12 months after the prior year’s end.) 12 November release\n\nWalgreens went big–and was sent home with the metaphorical tail between the hind legs. Perhaps engraved on VillageMD’s headstone will be what Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth said of VillageMD during the Q4 earnings call in October, “… We’ve declared it’s not a crucial part of our future.” Mr. Wentworth and the board declared months ago that they wished to sell all or part of the business, at least below their majority holding at 63% [TTA 8 Aug, 2 July] Who even wants to or is able to buy, with Walmart Health defunct and Oak Street Health and One Medical retrenching for their respective owners? Will VillageMD be part of anyone’s future? Healthcare Finance News, Healthcare Dive\n\nWeekend reading: 23andMe’s up in the air future, including genetic data; Walgreens debates What To Stop and Start; what if healthcare pursued a zero-failure rate?\n\nWhile 23andMe figures out a future….what happens to the genetic data? Troubled 23andMe today announced that it will be reporting its FY2025 Q2 numbers next Tuesday 12 November. An interesting part of their release is that shareholders can submit and upvote questions to management via the Say Technologies portal–and they’re blistering. They ask about the plan for recovery (132 votes, 60K shares represented), whether the company will be sold off piecemeal (128 votes, 73.5K shares) and a sale of the company (78 votes, 47.8K shares. Also questioned (38 votes, 3.4K shares): the addition of three new board members, none of whom have biopharmaceutical experience as all former CFOs outside of healthcare. These replace the seven that ankled on 17 September [TTA 17 Sept].\n\nTo Wojcicki, of course, with her reported 49.99% of voting control, shareholders’ questions aren’t really going to matter. Whether they will be addressed on Tuesday is anyone’s guess.\n\nMany 23andMe customers have questioned how to remove their personal genetic data from their database, which if en masse will reduce the value of the company. This TechCrunch article explains how that data is not covered by HIPAA privacy regulations, but 23andMe’s own retention rules.\n\nIf 23andMe sells, the data goes with it. If there is no sale, apparently recent Wojcicki statements indicate that the model going forward for the company is the sale of that data to pharma developers and researchers, ditching its independent drug discovery, and moving into telehealth prescribing of GLP-1 drugs through its Lemonaid subsidiary.\n\nFor those concerned about their privacy, or wary of a change of ownership, accounts can be easily deleted–but not the genetic information. TechCrunch gives how to delete your account–but apparently that won’t delete your genetic information, date of birth, and gender. 23andMe will also retain limited personal information attached to your account for an undefined time. Individuals can also reverse their consent for sharing that information with researchers, but cannot remove it. 12 million people have reportedly given consent–deliberately or not. A real lesson on oversharing for millions–if they care.\n\nWhat can Walgreens reasonably stop or reverse in its multiple series of Bad Decisions? A short interview at HLTH with US Healthcare head Mary Langowski indicates that there’s not much that hasn’t been already announced. We know that VillageMD is shuttering locations and is up for sale. 1,200 retail locations will be closed over the next three years. But what else to stop? “A lot of what I’ve fo­cused on in the first six months, is re­al­ly, it’s okay to stop stuff. What are we gonna stop?” While it’s totally fine to fail ‘at some things’, these weren’t small fails. Wentworth is concentrating on the new chief commercial officer selling Wal­greens’ ser­vices to pay­ers, providers, and life sci­ence com­pa­nies, such as clinical trials capabilities, CareCentrix, and Shields Health. There’s also some push towards “build­ing a stand­alone phar­ma­cy busi­ness rather than a ver­ti­cal­ly in­te­grat­ed busi­ness”. Endpoints News\n\nThinking about if healthcare adopted a ‘zero-failure’ rate. Michael Alkire’s (CEO, Premier Inc., a health system operational improvement provider) daughter was on Alaska Airlines’ Flight 1282 on 5 January 2024. That was the Boeing 737-9 MAX flight that had a blowout of a mid-cabin exit door plug placed there instead of an emergency exit door. The blowout was due to four improperly installed (loose) bolts. It occurred at 16,000 feet and the lower altitude, combined with no one seated in that row, contributed to a 100% survivability rate and a successful landing, though passengers were injured. Anyone with an interest in aircraft knows that one little thing, like a worn jackscrew on a rudder or an untightened bolt, can lead to a non-survivable crash.\n\nMr. Alkire’s point is that we should be striving, as the airlines and aircraft manufacturers have done (which failed in this case) for zero failure in healthcare. He cites the well-known statistic that 98,000 people die each year from medical errors. We don’t have a culture of continuous performance improvement. For one, clinical innovations can take nearly two decades to become standard practice. Yet it works. Simple things, such as clinical surveillance in nursing homes, can reduce adverse drug events by 92%. Much more to ponder in this Influencer contribution to MedCityNews. (And Boeing has a long way to go to restore trust–buying back Spirit AeroSystems, the former Boeing Wichita, is a necessary start they are finally making.)\n\nNews roundup 16 Oct: Walgreens shuts 1,200 stores–500 in ’25, CVS exiting core infusion biz, Masimo v. Apple update, DEA recommends 3rd telehealth extension, Change hack costing UHG $705M, Owlet back in NYSE compliance\n\nA roundup of chickens coming home to roost? But some chickens are just happy to come home.\n\nWalgreens’ Mound of Misery just grew a little higher. The headlines today were all about Walgreens’ closing 1,200 stores over the next three years. Their current store location roster is about 9,000, according to their website. 500 of these will be closed during their upcoming FY2025. Their release stated this would be “immediately accretive to adjusted EPS and free cash flow”. (Were they making any money at all?) This helped to give their share price a nice bump from $9 to above $10 at market close today. Last year, Walgreens’ shares were priced above $22.\n\nQ4 (closing 31 August) closed with a 6% boost in retail sales. However, losses were $3.0 billion versus a net loss of $180 million in the prior year’s Q4. The reasons cited in their release were a higher operating loss, a $2.3 billion non-cash charge for valuation allowance on deferred tax assets primarily related to opioid liabilities recognized in prior periods, and a non-cash impairment charge related to equity investment in China. The operating loss related to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge for CareCentrix.\n\nThe full year was not cheery. Sales were $147.7 billion, an increase of 6.2% from a year ago (in constant currency, 5.7%). But losses in their FY2024 were $14.1 billion, a stunning increase of 104.5% compared to prior year.\n\nVillageMD is being monetized along with other assets. “CEO Tim Wentworth said in the earnings call that the company is focused on “monetizing non-core assets to generate cash,” naming VillageMD as an example, to focus on its core retail pharmacy business.” HIStalk 16 Oct Can Walgreens shrink itself to profitability? Fierce Healthcare\n\nOver at CVS, they’re doing their own shrinking. CVS is closing its core infusion services business, with plans to either close or sell 29 related regional pharmacies. Infusion services were bought from Coram LLC in 2013 for $2.1 billion. This Reuters exclusive was based on an 8 October memo and confirmed by a CVS press representative. Patients relying on antibiotics, drugs supporting muscular health, and intravenous nutrition services will be transferred to other providers. CVS will continue to provide certain services: specialty medications and enteral nutrition, or tube feeding, at pharmacies in Minnesota, Pennsylvania and San Diego, with nationwide nursing services. Hat tip to HIStalk 16 Oct.\n\nMasimo wins one big patent challenge, loses one (or four), to Apple.\n\nThe Win: Apple had sued Masimo in the US District Court of Delaware for patent infringement of Apple’s utility patent 10,942,491 B2 (“the ‘491 patent”). Masimo was charged as violating Apple’s patent on 19 features. Masimo appealed to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for an inter partes review (IPR) of the patent on the grounds of ‘unpatentability’, a very high proof. Masimo succeeded in this, rendering Apple’s ‘491 patent useless. Apple can appeal but the likelihood of success against the PTAB ruling that required three administrative patent judges to review, at this level of proof, is low. In this Editor’s view, this may spur other developers to come up with innovations now that these 19 features have been deemed unpatentable.\n\nThe Loss (I think): In review in the Delaware District Court are four complicated lawsuits between the two combatants, with Apple’s premise that Masimo has infringed upon other patents. Masimo alleged “inequitable conduct” by Apple in their patent filings with the PTO, essentially alleging fraudulent filings on multiple patents. Apple has been granted a summary judgment on Masimo’s claims, throwing them out.\n\nInterestingly, Masimo–never shy to announce wins versus their foe Apple under the prior leadership of Joe Kiani–has remained strangely mum. (Perhaps everyone is waiting for the takeover dust to settle?) Will the ‘new’ Masimo be so combative against Apple? A far more detailed analysis for the patent mavens is in Strata-gee. A very large hat tip and bow to their editor, Ted Green, who writes about marketing primarily in the audio/visual business but has been 100% on top of The Masimo Saga–thank you!\n\nTo no one’s surprise, DEA kicks the telehealth waiver can down the road–for the third time. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sent to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a proposed rule to extend telehealth prescribing of Schedule II and higher controlled substances without changes. These waivers which removed the in-person examination requirement under the Ryan-Haight Act were instituted during the Covid pandemic and extended twice [TTA 11 Oct 23, 11 May 23] with a final expiration of 31 December 2024. In September, reports indicated that DEA not only wanted to restore prior restrictions but also wished to introduce additional ones. However, their timing (September!) given Federal standards of publishing draft rules and lengthy comment periods before a final rule was impossible to be achieved by year’s end. [TTA 13 Sept]\n\nWhether OMB will approve the extension (to a date that cannot be confirmed since the text is unavailable, but reportedly one year) is not certain, as it may be disputed by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Since the waiver is due to expire at the end of the year, this may help to assure the multitude of mental health and other telehealth companies dependent on legal remote diagnosis and prescribing controlled substances that their businesses can continue. FierceHealthcare\n\nUHG didn’t have a happy quarter either due to Change. The total hit to UnitedHealth Group of the Change Healthcare hack is now estimated at $705 million, or 75 cents a share. Their 2025 guidance on profit is a lackluster $30 per share–below Wall Street estimates of $31.18. Government plans’ cuts in payments for Medicare Advantage plus and low state payment rates for Medicaid are affecting UHG as well as nearly every other payer. UHG’s share price on the news reacted negatively, falling 9% and dragging down other payers as well. UHG must rue the day they bought Change Healthcare, as it has been largely bad news ever since. CNBC\n\nAnd winding up on a happy note–Owlet is back in good graces with the NYSE. Last year, they faced a NYSE notification that they were out of compliance with the $50 million minimum valuation of the company over a consecutive 30-day trading day period. They are now in compliance and their Class A shares can trade without the ‘BC’ black mark and no longer be listed as such on the NYSE website. The NYSE will be following its standard procedure of a 12-month follow-up on compliance. Release, Mobihealthnews\n\nThe baby sock and baby monitoring company has had a rough couple of years between a cracked SPAC (2021), FDA notifying them at the end of 2021 that they considered the Smart Sock a medical device, forcing the company to pull it from distribution [TTA 4 Dec 21], mounting losses, layoffs, and rebuilding with an FDA-cleared BabySat and enhanced Dream Sock [TTA 21 June 23]. Usually, this concatenation of events means the company either shuts or sells, but Owlet has done neither and bootstrapped itself. Revenue in their Q2 ending 30 June was up 58% year over year with a narrower operating loss of $2.2 million, compared with $6.7 million in prior year. It recently expanded their European distribution of the Dream Sock after CE Mark certification in May to a total of 11 countries [TTA 18 Sep].\n\nWhat’s next for: Steward CEO now in criminal contempt of Congress; Walgreens’ Pessina’s fortune vanishes by 97%; Masimo’s Kiani now a man without a company\n\nSenate unanimously votes to hold Steward Health CEO in contempt. The resolution passed on Wednesday 25 September refers the contempt charges against Dr. Ralph de la Torre, the CEO of Steward Health, to the Department of Justice (DOJ). The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) voted on 19 September to recommend two contempt charges–criminal and civil–to the full Senate. It is the first time since 1971 that a criminal contempt charge has been passed. The DOJ’s actions can include prosecution by the District of Columbia’s US Attorney which can mean arrest and possible incarceration, with a fine that doesn’t exceed $100,000, or civil contempt which usually involves a fine and another subpoena to appear. FierceHealthcare, Becker’s\n\nThe threatening language of the HELP committee members such as Bernie Sanders and Ed Markey surely did not encourage de la Torre or his legal counsel to appear on 12 September, with the anger across the board among all members regardless of party. All that it promised to be was, in street language, the worst kind of beatdown. Formally, the appearance was rejected because of Steward’s bankruptcy in adjudication in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas supervising the sale of Steward assets. There is also a court order that prevents de la Torre from commenting during the sale process. To the press, his legal counsel depicted the HELP committee hearing as “a pseudo-criminal proceeding in which they use the time, not to gather facts, but to convict Dr. de la Torre in the eyes of public opinion.” TTA 14 Sept\n\nSteward Health’s spectacular collapse opens even more Pandora’s Boxes for de la Torre. He possibly faces additional lawsuits attempting to ‘pierce the corporate veil’ to claw back his bank and personal, sizeable maritime and aviation assets–or hold him criminally liable, far more complicated, long-term, and damaging. A cynical view would be that de la Torre would be well advised to get on his $40 million yacht or one of his private aircraft–and depart for a destination that is reluctant to extradite to the US.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance’s troubles drastically shrink executive chairman Stefano Pessina’s personal fortune. Chairman Pessina, who holds 17% of WBA stock and is the single largest shareholder, has seen his holdings shrink in value by 97%, from $12 billion in 2015 to a current $1.3 billion, according to Bloomberg data. The 83-year-old WBA head has seen hard times before. He pulled a rabbit out of the proverbial hat in 2007 by going private with Boots and then merging it with Walgreens in 2015, but time and Mr. Market are not on his side with taking on the debt load necessary.\n\nIs WBA or Walgreens attractive to an acquirer? With stock trading at a record low of around $8 and a market capitalization of about $7.5 billion, it may be a bargain if an investor ignores or doesn’t blanch at the debt load. But those who understand the business cannot buy due to US antitrust regulations, which rules out any retail competitor or PBM. Or the company could be parted out to healthcare providers or a health insurer, but that ignores their miseries, such as reduced Medicare Advantage reimbursements. Their mistakes such as VillageMD and unprofitable locations are in the middle of being worked out and the company is shrinking. Meanwhile, their 15 October full-year earnings report will be dripping with red ink, as their Q1-3 lost $314 million versus prior year earnings of $1.2 billion. Crain’s Chicago Business\n\nVanishing for Joe Kiani is his day job at Masimo after a dramatic proxy fight. The founder of the audio and health monitor company was voted out of his board seat by shareholders. He followed by resigning as CEO after founding the company 35 years ago. Michelle Brennan, a board member (from Politan) has been appointed as interim CEO. Previously, she was a senior executive at Johnson & Johnson’s companies, including international experience in business development, for over 30 years. She also is on the board of Cardinal Health. Korn Ferry is coordinating the search for a permanent CEO.\n\nThe proxy battle wasn’t even close, according a CNBC report reported by Strata-gee. Quoting an inside source, the Politan slate of two directors, Darlene Solomon and William Jellison, received twice as many votes as Joe Kiani and Christopher Chavez on the Masimo slate.\n\nThe company is continuing ‘strategic alternatives’ (read: sale) of its consumer health and audio businesses, the latter mostly acquired in the utterly snakebit 2022 acquisition of Sound United’s consumer audio brands. Masimo is using Centerview Partners and Morgan Stanley as financial advisors and Sullivan & Cromwell as a legal advisor. Presumably, the Kiani-arranged sales to or joint ventures of these units with unnamed investors is off. Masimo will be retaining their professional healthcare and pulse oximetry products. For Q3 2024, Masimo reiterated its financials from early August, with earlier guidance here.\n\nWhether others will depart with Kiani is too soon to tell. During the proxy fight in July, Masimo’s chief operating officer, Bilal Muhsin, promised to resign if Kiani was forced out, specifically citing that he would refuse to work with Quentin Koffey, a Masimo director and chief investment officer of Politan Capital. Other managers signed similar letters around the same time. However, in the Masimo release on the Kiani resignation, financials, and management changes, CFO Micah Young and Muhsin stated that would provide more details on an earnings call in October.\n\nThe Strate-gee view was that shareholders got tired of hearing promises about Sound United and that Kiani was high-handed with them–treating it as his personal company and not theirs.
