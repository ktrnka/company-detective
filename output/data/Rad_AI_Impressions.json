      "# [Save Time and Decrease Burnout with Radiology AI Software](https://www.radai.com/)\nRad AI Continuity is the most comprehensive follow-up management platform on the market, tracking more than 50 categories of incidental findings and significantly increasing patient follow-up rates. We’re very excited about this collaboration as it will allow us to have improved visibility and provide a safety net over our entire patient population to ensure our patients feel informed and empowered.\n\nWith Continuity, we have a 100% radiology safety net. Every single radiology report that comes in with an incidental finding has been communicated to the appropriate stakeholders. We're tracking whether or not those follow-ups happen within the appropriate, recommended timeframe mitigating all our liability to ensure that we keep patients in our network.\n\nThe amazing thing about Rad AI Reporting is that you're able to achieve exponential efficiency gains, but with less perceived effort. It doesn't benefit you if you're going faster but you know you're going fast because you're more fatigued. The idea is to smooth things out in a way where you're almost in a flow state, and Rad AI Reporting does that.\n\nHaving greatly benefited from using Rad AI Impressions, we are thrilled to add Continuity to our current partnership with the team at Rad AI. The management of incidental findings in radiology reports is a key focus for our group as it’s incredibly beneficial for the patients we serve. After evaluating every vendor in this space, we found that Continuity provides the most automated and most comprehensive solution in follow-up management.\n\nIt gives you the ability to generate a complete report in the interpreting radiologist's own language, whether you use structured reporting or dictate freely, just by dictating the pertinent findings. This saves an enormous amount of wasted energy in having to create full sentences.\n\nRad AI Impressions is what we have all been waiting for! Providing much-needed efficiency gains in my daily workflow life is sometimes absolutely surreal! It is like I have my own trainee who perfectly excels at impressions.\n\nUsing Rad AI Impressions to auto-generate my impressions has been wonderful. I’ve gotten to use it on overnight shifts, and it’s a game changer. It really helps with breezing through case volume with less fatigue.\n\nWhile hard to measure in minutes or seconds or even dollars, one huge value is the \"coffee sip\" factor. Before Rad AI Impressions, I was talking all the time and my cup of coffee in the morning would inevitably get cold. With Rad AI impressions, I get just long enough of a break to take a sip of warm coffee. And each time I sip my warm coffee, I smile.\n\nRad AI exceeded radiologist expectations out of the gate. Seamless integration permitted our radiologists to immediately realize the efficiencies of the Rad AI Impressions platform. With Rad AI, our radiologists reported feeling less stressed with more time available to review studies or tend to other tasks. This is exactly the type of IT solution needed to help reduce radiologists’ burnout and boost job satisfaction.\n\nHaving greatly benefited from using Rad AI Impressions, we are thrilled to add Continuity to our current partnership with the team at Rad AI. The management of incidental findings in radiology reports is a key focus for our group as it’s incredibly beneficial for the patients we serve. After evaluating every vendor in this space, we found that Continuity provides the most automated and most comprehensive solution in follow-up management.\n\nWe have seen how critical it is to close the loop on significant incidental findings and what a challenging problem it is to address using our currently available resources. By automating the majority of steps related to patient follow-ups, Rad AI removes those manual tasks from our clinical team and gives them back more time to focus on caring for their patients.\n\nWhen we recently discussed our expansions and renewals for AI solutions, we saw Rad AI as a must-have. If we were to rank our solutions, it's at the top. With a high volume of high acuity cases, Rad AI Impressions helps us manage our caseload. The performance continues to improve -- in 90 to 95% of the impressions that it generates, I don't have to edit anything, and the consensus guideline recommendations are working really well.\n\nWe are committed to the patients and healthcare entities we serve, and we believe that partnering with Rad AI will improve the efficiency of our radiologists and increase the value associated with our services. We look forward to using Rad AI Impressions' automated impression technology to make our radiologists more effective and to help decrease burnout.\n\nRad AI Impressions will assist our radiologists in providing the highest-quality reports, while greatly reducing the rework that is built into the process. We’re excited to partner with Rad AI, as the feedback we’ve received from other Strategic Radiology members nationally has been overwhelmingly positive, and we’re looking forward to the same experience at our practice.\n\nWe’ve been incredibly pleased with the partnership that has developed with Rad AI. As a CIO, your aim is to make investments in technology that make a tangible difference throughout the practice. Once the Rad AI Impressions rollout began, the benefits spread 'word of mouth' style like a brushfire. The radiologists became the largest supporters of the product – touting the efficiency, quality and overall reduction in fatigue improvements amongst themselves. Expansion of the agreement was a no-brainer. I would strongly encourage any radiology practice CIO seeking an impactful AI investment to prioritize a relationship with Rad AI.\n\nEven though Rad AI has an incredible reputation in the radiology community, we were hesitant to try AI in our practice and wanted to prove it out for ourselves. After using Rad AI Impressions with a small initial set of users, we are so glad we did as we saw an immediate impact. We are now rapidly expanding to the rest of the radiologists in our practice.\n\nAfter thoroughly evaluating numerous radiology AI solutions via our collaborative we believe Rad AI Impressions will provide the most impactful value proposition for our member groups. Rad AI impressions' automated impression generator extracted from the radiologist’s dictated findings not only results in enhanced report quality and efficiency, but also helps alleviate fatigue by the end of a shift.\n\nI knew from the first time I used Rad AI Impressions it would be a complete game-changer by allowing us to turn around the highest-quality reports faster with fewer addenda. Of all the technology and solutions that we’ve implemented for our practice, Rad AI Impressions has made the biggest impact on our efficiency and quality. I have personally reached out to colleagues of mine to prioritize a partnership with Rad AI.\n\nOur practice has been on the forefront of innovation in radiology, building on our heritage of leading the way with transformative technologies that ultimately prove to become the gold standard for radiology practices. We believe our partnership with Rad AI will enable us to maintain this type of technological leadership, and Rad AI Impressions will be a powerfully assistive tool for our radiologists.\n\nWe expanded our partnership with Rad AI to every radiologist not just because of the benefits our radiologists experienced, but also because the Rad AI team is incredible to work with. They truly listen and prioritize our feedback.\n\nOur initial group of radiologist users were very impressed by Rad AI’s ability to reduce fatigue and improve productivity using artificial intelligence, while improving the quality of patient care. We evaluate many AI vendors, and Rad AI proved to not only be a valuable solution our radiologists wanted to use, but they’ve also been a fantastic partner in helping us fully leverage the power of AI to do more for our patients.\n\nIt’s important to Inland Imaging to remain at the forefront of implementing groundbreaking technology to best serve our patients and provide the optimal environment for our radiologists to do their best work. Our radiologists are impressed with the efficiency gains, quality gains, and reduction in fatigue. Rad AI is an ideal partner that is both innovative and customer-focused, and places a premium on developing long-term partnerships.\n\nRad AI has made a big difference in my daily productivity and endurance throughout my day. I am now less mentally fatigued towards the end of my day because I do not have the added mental strain of summarizing my findings in the impression. The program does it for me. I also find myself catching more voice recognition errors when I read over the generated impression which allows me to go back and fix these errors in the body of the report… an added bonus!",

I would strongly encourage any radiology practice CIO seeking an impactful AI investment to prioritize a relationship with Rad AI.\n\nEven though Rad AI has an incredible reputation in the radiology community, we were hesitant to try AI in our practice and wanted to prove it out for ourselves. After using Rad AI Impressions with a small initial set of users, we are so glad we did as we saw an immediate impact. We are now rapidly expanding to the rest of the radiologists in our practice.\n\nAfter thoroughly evaluating numerous radiology AI solutions via our collaborative we believe Rad AI Impressions will provide the most impactful value proposition for our member groups. Rad AI impressions' automated impression generator extracted from the radiologist’s dictated findings not only results in enhanced report quality and efficiency, but also helps alleviate fatigue by the end of a shift.\n\nI knew from the first time I used Rad AI Impressions it would be a complete game-changer by allowing us to turn around the highest-quality reports faster with fewer addenda. Of all the technology and solutions that we’ve implemented for our practice, Rad AI Impressions has made the biggest impact on our efficiency and quality. I have personally reached out to colleagues of mine to prioritize a partnership with Rad AI.\n\nOur practice has been on the forefront of innovation in radiology, building on our heritage of leading the way with transformative technologies that ultimately prove to become the gold standard for radiology practices. We believe our partnership with Rad AI will enable us to maintain this type of technological leadership, and Rad AI Impressions will be a powerfully assistive tool for our radiologists.\n\nWe expanded our partnership with Rad AI to every radiologist not just because of the benefits our radiologists experienced, but also because the Rad AI team is incredible to work with. They truly listen and prioritize our feedback.\n\nOur initial group of radiologist users were very impressed by Rad AI’s ability to reduce fatigue and improve productivity using artificial intelligence, while improving the quality of patient care. We evaluate many AI vendors, and Rad AI proved to not only be a valuable solution our radiologists wanted to use, but they’ve also been a fantastic partner in helping us fully leverage the power of AI to do more for our patients.\n\nIt’s important to Inland Imaging to remain at the forefront of implementing groundbreaking technology to best serve our patients and provide the optimal environment for our radiologists to do their best work. Our radiologists are impressed with the efficiency gains, quality gains, and reduction in fatigue. Rad AI is an ideal partner that is both innovative and customer-focused, and places a premium on developing long-term partnerships.\n\nRad AI has made a big difference in my daily productivity and endurance throughout my day. I am now less mentally fatigued towards the end of my day because I do not have the added mental strain of summarizing my findings in the impression. The program does it for me. I also find myself catching more voice recognition errors when I read over the generated impression which allows me to go back and fix these errors in the body of the report… an added bonus!",

      "# [SIIM 2023](https://www.radai.com/events/conferences/siim-2023)\nWhen we recently discussed our expansions and renewals for AI solutions, we saw Rad AI as a must-have. If we were to rank our solutions, it's at the top. With a high volume of high acuity cases, Rad AI Impressions helps us manage our caseload. The performance continues to improve -- in 90 to 95% of the impressions that it generates, I don't have to edit anything, and the consensus guideline recommendations are working really well.\n\nEven though Rad AI has an incredible reputation in the radiology community, we were hesitant to try AI in our practice and wanted to prove it out for ourselves. After using Rad AI Impressions with a small initial set of users, we are so glad we did as we saw an immediate impact. We are now rapidly expanding to the rest of the radiologists in our practice.\n\nWe’ve been incredibly pleased with the partnership that has developed with Rad AI. As a CIO, your aim is to make investments in technology that make a tangible difference throughout the practice. Once the Rad AI Impressions rollout began, the benefits spread 'word of mouth' style like a brushfire. The radiologists became the largest supporters of the product – touting the efficiency, quality and overall reduction in fatigue improvements amongst themselves. Expansion of the agreement was a no-brainer. I would strongly encourage any radiology practice CIO seeking an impactful AI investment to prioritize a relationship with Rad AI.\n\nRad AI is a tremendous partner and their AI solution improves quality, efficiency, and, ultimately, improves patient care. Personally, Rad AI is the first AI solution that made me appreciate the benefits of adopting AI — I’m looking forward to seeing how AI can positively impact radiologists, practices, and health systems.\n\nAfter thoroughly evaluating numerous radiology AI solutions via our collaborative we believe Rad AI Impressions will provide the most impactful value proposition for our member groups. Rad AI impressions' automated impression generator extracted from the radiologist’s dictated findings not only results in enhanced report quality and efficiency, but also helps alleviate fatigue by the end of a shift.\n\nOur practice has been on the forefront of innovation in radiology, building on our heritage of leading the way with transformative technologies that ultimately prove to become the gold standard for radiology practices.

      "# [Rad AI Reporting](https://app.radai.com/docs/fhircast/)\nFHIRcast\n\nFHIRcast is a standard developed to provide real-time synchronization and context sharing between healthcare applications. It builds on the foundations of FHIR resources, but focuses specifically on ensuring that multiple applications remain synchronized in real-time as users interact with them.\n\nFHIRcast requires a centralized system to manage real-time synchronization and context sharing. This system is referred to as a “FHIRcast hub”.\n\nHere’s how FHIRcast works:\n\nSubscription setup: Applications subscribe to a FHIRcast hub for specific events. This is typically done during application startup.\n\nEvent triggering: When a user interacts with an application (e.g., opens a patient record or an imaging study), the application sends an event to the FHIRcast hub.\n\nReal-time notification: The FHIRcast hub immediately broadcasts this event to all subscribed applications via WebSockets, ensuring they are notified in real-time.\n\nContext synchronization: Subscribed applications receive the event notification and adjust their context accordingly. For example, if an imaging study is opened in one application, other applications might display related patient information or open the same study.\n\nA radiologist opens an imaging study in their PACS.\n\nThe PACS sends an event to the FHIRcast hub, indicating that the ImagingStudy FHIR resource has been opened.\n\nThe FHIRcast hub broadcasts this event to all subscribed applications, including the Rad AI Reporting application.\n\nThe Rad AI Reporting application receives the notification and automatically opens the same ImagingStudy, ready for the radiologist to dictate their findings into a new report."

Right now we don't really use anything besides pulmonary nodule counter (SUPER helpful) and pneumothorax detector for CXR. \n\nWe tested brain MRI AI analysis briefly last year but it degraded the images so much, was not helpful, and did not incorporate into our PACS well so it was stopped. \n\nThere has been no talk of implementing any other AI software.

Idk how exactly (in EM) but when I open CT images even before the radiologist read is uploaded just to look there is a prelim AI read and it will say in big read letters “PE Suspected”“ICH Suspected”/ or “not detected”.

It’s pretty trash tbh, I briefly glance at it first when I’m about to look for nodules but then do my own search afterwards.\n\nWe also have a program that tries to detect LVO on CTA’s but it’s also quite bad. It always thinks the M1 segments are occluded, and literally earlier today it missed a complete M2 occlusion on one of my cases.\n\n\nI’m not sure if the RAPID series on Ct perfusion is an AI thing but we use that to get a mismatch volume/ratio for penumbra. Again, it’s pretty Garbo"

While the typical start-up culture of sexual harassment does not exist (truly a wonderful job of that), there are many, many micro-aggressions against women. Also, some \"favorite\" mid-level leaders treat other teammates terribly. Intentionally set them up for failure, stab them in the back, and stop at nothing to elevate themselves - and that behavior is rewarded. This is going to breed a toxic, toxic culture if not quickly addressed.",

          "cons": "Everything started great - until I realized the lack of women in leadership positions. (Take a look at the website). Knowing the heart of many people - I really tried to dismiss this. It quickly became clear that the expectation was for women to do the women's work. Heavy lifting before, during, and after events would be left to only female team members. Leadership would come halfway through the event, not acknowledge them, and leave before the event was over, often in dangerous cities or situations without offering to help. It's been elevated to the point that other companies noticed and offered to stay behind to ensure they had the necessary help. Leaders often complained about spending time with team members and repeatedly said they didn't like team-building activities, conferences, etc. Often, ideas and projects from the only female team member are claimed by other team members. Female team members are cut off in meetings, and important initiatives are not supported by leadership that is assigned to female team members. I would also caution you to provide feedback in the weekly employee surveys. Shortly after, a few began sharing their dissatisfaction; it was brought up in team meetings about \"negativity,\" and they were let go shortly after. A few \"favorites\" play games - what they say in private slack messages and publically are wildly different and borderline harassing. They will be publically praised in all team meetings while their abusive behavior towards other teammates is ignored. I truly don't think they are aware of the microaggressions (and likely could be addressed). Still, a few people on the team do the most outwardly blatantly toxic behaviors privately, and senior leadership is likely unaware. But because those individuals are constantly being praised \"as the only people on the team doing things correctly\" it isn't possible to bring up concerns.",

All meetings are recorded as the leadership cannot trust their employees to do work. It is amazing how much time people spend playing politics when there is not even a working product nor a market fit yet.\r\n\r\nAnimosity between cofounders as the CFO has taken over as CEO. While they claim that the company was built by radiologists for radiologists, the radiologist / ex-CEO has no power, always working alone at a corner of the office away from other employees. \"Automate radiologists' paycheck\" is the true culture of the company. Condescending memes about radiologists are posted publicly. The ML team is heavily inflated with a lot of ego. Be prepared to make avocado toasts for your manager. Their AI does not work and they cover up their flaws by not having tests, blotching usage stat, and blaming the radiologists for not being \"consistent\".\r\n\r\nThe current CEO has assembled an executive team of yes-people who are willing to play his game and support him no matter what. While they have no real autonomy, they are rewarded with promotions beyond their experience or competence. If you dare to disagree with him, you'd be ushered out of the back door. The day when shelter-in-place was in order, he was enraged and said \"Why don't we let the people who is going to die, die, instead of ruining the economy?!\" Employees who criticized his handling of COVID were layoff a week later due to \"performance issues\".\r\n\r\nXenophobic and sexist comments get toasted around regularly. I have never worked at a place less inclusive than Rad AI.",

While they claim that the company was built by radiologists for radiologists, the radiologist / ex-CEO has no power, always working alone at a corner of the office away from other employees. \"Automate radiologists' paycheck\" is the true culture of the company. Condescending memes about radiologists are posted publicly. The ML team is heavily inflated with a lot of ego. Be prepared to make avocado toasts for your manager. Their AI does not work and they cover up their flaws by not having tests, blotching usage stat, and blaming the radiologists for not being \"consistent\".\r\n\r\nThe current CEO has assembled an executive team of yes-people who are willing to play his game and support him no matter what. While they have no real autonomy, they are rewarded with promotions beyond their experience or competence. If you dare to disagree with him, you'd be ushered out of the back door. The day when shelter-in-place was in order, he was enraged and said \"Why don't we let the people who is going to die, die, instead of ruining the economy?!\" Employees who criticized his handling of COVID were layoff a week later due to \"performance issues\".\r\n\r\nXenophobic and sexist comments get toasted around regularly.

        "advice": "Find a way to elevate women leaders. While the typical start-up culture of sexual harassment does not exist (truly a wonderful job of that), there are many, many micro-aggressions against women. Also, some \"favorite\" mid-level leaders treat other teammates terribly. Intentionally set them up for failure, stab them in the back, and stop at nothing to elevate themselves - and that behavior is rewarded. This is going to breed a toxic, toxic culture if not quickly addressed.",
        "cons": "Everything started great - until I realized the lack of women in leadership positions. (Take a look at the website). Knowing the heart of many people - I really tried to dismiss this. It quickly became clear that the expectation was for women to do the women's work. Heavy lifting before, during, and after events would be left to only female team members. Leadership would come halfway through the event, not acknowledge them, and leave before the event was over, often in dangerous cities or situations without offering to help. It's been elevated to the point that other companies noticed and offered to stay behind to ensure they had the necessary help. Leaders often complained about spending time with team members and repeatedly said they didn't like team-building activities, conferences, etc. Often, ideas and projects from the only female team member are claimed by other team members. Female team members are cut off in meetings, and important initiatives are not supported by leadership that is assigned to female team members. I would also caution you to provide feedback in the weekly employee surveys. Shortly after, a few began sharing their dissatisfaction; it was brought up in team meetings about \"negativity,\" and they were let go shortly after. A few \"favorites\" play games - what they say in private slack messages and publically are wildly different and borderline harassing. They will be publically praised in all team meetings while their abusive behavior towards other teammates is ignored. I truly don't think they are aware of the microaggressions (and likely could be addressed). Still, a few people on the team do the most outwardly blatantly toxic behaviors privately, and senior leadership is likely unaware. But because those individuals are constantly being praised \"as the only people on the team doing things correctly\" it isn't possible to bring up concerns.",

      "# [Rad AI Website](https://www.radai.com/case-studies/80-percent-fewer-words-dictated-using-rad-ai-omni-impressions-a-case-study-with-colorado-imaging-associates-p-c)\nPartner Profile & The Challenge\n\nA leading private radiology practice, Colorado Imaging Associates (CIA) boasts a team of 48 top-tier radiologists dedicated to providing superior patient care through state-of-the-art imaging and interpretation.\n\nDespite their expertise, CIA radiologists faced common industry challenges: time-intensive reporting processes, increasing scan volumes, and the risk of burnout. With the need to enhance efficiency and maintain quality, CIA sought a solution that could streamline their workflow without compromising the accuracy and detail in their reports.\n\n“We are part of a consortium of 12 private practices, an MSO called Unified Radiology, and we heard very positive word of mouth feedback on the value of Rad AI from our sister practices.”\n\n-Kevin Woolley, MD, FACR, CIA Radiologist\n\nThe Solution\n\nColorado Imaging Associates has always sought to stay at the forefront of industry advancements. True to these roots, they turned to technology to help them grapple with the challenges of increasing exam volumes. The partnership with Rad AI came about as they sought to improve their service quality and efficiency.\n\n“We were impressed by the demonstrations Rad AI provided and the management team's adaptiveness in working with us, as well as the cost efficiency of using Rad AI.”\n\n-Sachin Talusani, MD, CIA President\n\nColorado Imaging Associates harnessed the power of Rad AI Impressions to revolutionize their report generation process. Rad AI Impressions uses generative AI to automate the creation of accurate and comprehensive impressions in radiology reports. CIA had been seeking technological solutions to manage high exam volumes and reduce radiologist stress. Rad AI's partnership with CIA began in July 2023, and the implementation of Rad AI Impressions began a new chapter in CIA's operational excellence.\n\nImpact Analysis\n\nBy analyzing data from 21 radiologists for their pre and post-implementation periods, Rad AI was able to quantify the significant impact of Rad AI Impressions. The results revealed that radiologists in the study experienced an 80% reduction in the number of words dictated per impression and a 30% reduction in the time spent on impressions overall.\n\n80% Fewer Words Dictated Per Impression\n\nOne of the most significant benefits CIA experienced with Rad AI Impressions was a drastic reduction in the number of words radiologists needed to dictate. On average, the number of dictated words per impression decreased by 80% for CIA radiologists.\n\nThis reduction has numerous benefits. Dr. Woolley, a CIA radiologist, emphasized that not having to talk as much was the most important advantage for him personally. Dictating fewer words leads to reduced vocal strain and fatigue over the course of a shift. It also contributes to lower stress and burnout.\n\n“Much of the mental stress from the work that I do is related to vocalizing something that you have in your head, and the only way to get it into a report form is to say it, which slows the radiologist down and requires more mental energy. Personally, I feel that Rad AI takes care of about 99% of that work.”\n\n-Kevin Woolley, MD, FACR, CIA Radiologist\n\n30% Less Time Spent on Impressions\n\nIn addition to fewer dictated words, Rad AI Impressions led to a 30% reduction in the overall time CIA's radiologists spent on impressions. Before Rad AI Impression, radiologists spent an average of 30 seconds per impression. After Rad AI Impressions, this decreased to just 21 seconds.\n\nRad AI Impressions achieves these time savings by using AI to automatically generate impressions based on the radiologist's dictated findings. This eliminates several manual steps that can be time-consuming, such as reviewing findings or other notes, rechecking images, and dictating impressions, saving precious seconds on each report. Rad AI Impressions completes the automated impression in just 1 to 3 seconds. These efficiency gains can have a major impact on revenue and the ability to handle rising scan volumes.\n\n“Rad AI removes the added mental and physical work of saying what I normally say, doing it extremely accurately, and allowing me to do 5-10% more work with the same mental energy.”\n\n-Kevin Woolley, MD, FACR, CIA Radiologist\n\nAdditional Benefits: Improved Accuracy and Reduced Burnout\n\nBeyond efficiency gains, CIA discovered additional benefits to using Rad AI Impressions, including improved report accuracy and reduced burnout.\n\n\"An unexpected aspect of using Rad AI Rad AI Impressions was the improvement in the quality of our reports. We found that misstatements in the findings were duplicated in the impression, and that afforded us an opportunity to go back and correct those discrepancies.\"\n\n-Sachin Talusani, MD, CIA President\n\nMoreover, the efficiency gains and reduction in repetitive dictation contribute to lower stress and burnout among radiologists. Dr. Woolley noted the cognitive breaks between reports, enabled by Rad AI Impressions, are very apparent and helpful over the course of a shift.\n\n“With that 5-10% increase in productivity, I feel palpably less tired and burned out at the end of a workday doing 5-10% more. I haven’t experienced anything in my career since voice recognition with a similar impact. It really makes my days much better and makes me ready to do more work, leaving me less tired when I start work the next day.”\n\n-Kevin Woolley, MD, FACR, CIA Radiologist\n\nSummary and Key Takeaways\n\nColorado Imaging Associates' experience with Rad AI Impressions demonstrates the significant impact generative AI can have in radiology. With an 80% reduction in dictated words per impression and a 30% reduction in time spent on impressions, CIA's radiologists are working more efficiently while maintaining high report accuracy.\n\n80% reduction in impression words dictated per report (from 67 to 15 words per impression)\n\n30% reduction in overall time spent on impressions (from 30 to 21 seconds per report on average)\n\n40% reduction in MRI impression times (from 50 to 29 seconds on average)\n\n30% reduction in CT impression times (from 52 to 37 seconds on average)\n\n20% reduction in Ultrasound and CR impression times",

      "# [Rad AI, a startup that helps radiologists save time on report generation, raises $50M Series B from Khosla Ventures by Marina Temkin on 2024-05-07](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/07/rad-ai-a-startup-that-helps-radiologists-save-time-on-report-generation-raises-50m-series-b-from-khosla-ventures/)\nIn 2017, Vinod Khosla told CNBC that the job “of the radiologist will be obsolete in five years.” While the founder of Khosla Ventures later revised that timeline to as long as 15 years, he maintained that AI image recognition could soon diagnose disease on scans better than human doctors.\n\nSeven years later, radiologists are still required to interpret most scans (even if AI software helps them); the more immediate challenge is the shortage of these doctors in the United States and around the world.\n\nWhile Khosla Ventures has backed several imaging startups, including Vista.ai and Q Bio, the firm’s latest bet is on a company that makes radiologists’ workload easier by reducing the time spent on report documentation, instead of trying to replace the physician with a machine.\n\nOn Tuesday, Khosla led a $50 million Series B into Rad AI, which developed a tool that can generate reports for radiologists. Other participants in the round included World Innovation Lab and returning investors ARTIS Ventures, OCV Partners, Kickstart Fund and Gradient Ventures (Google’s AI-focused fund). The financing brought the company’s total capital raised to over $80 million.\n\nRad AI was founded in 2018 by Dr. Jeff Chang, who completed his medical training as a radiologist when he was 16 and later received an MBA from UCLA, and serial entrepreneur Doktor Gurson.\n\nSince Chang knew from his own experience as a practicing doctor that the majority of radiologists’ time is spent documenting findings rather than analyzing images, the pair decided to develop a proprietary LLM trained on radiology report datasets for automating doctors’ findings and impressions documentation.\n\nWhile tech companies didn’t widely use generative AI until OpenAI’s ChatGPT burst onto the scene in 2022, Rad AI takes pride in being an early adopter of this technology. “I’m confident we’re the first company in radiology to start using LLMs,” Gurson, Rad AI’s CEO told TechCrunch. “We started doing that work in 2018, around the same time that open AI was creating their [first] models.”\n\nSix years later, Rad AI’s products are used by about a third of U.S. health systems and nine of the 10 largest radiology groups in the country, Gurson said.\n\nThe fresh capital will be used to build a team that deploys Rad AI’s latest product: a standalone radiology reporting solution.\n\n“We have a lot of interest, but there’s only so much we can deploy at once,” Gurson said, adding that Rad AI is hiring people who can install and maintain the software.\n\nSome incumbents have been trying to add GenAI functionality to their radiology reporting software over the past 18 months, but Rad AI doesn’t consider these companies to be true competitors yet.\n\n“At this point, probably 99% to 100% of the market uses our products,” he said. “If it’s any indication, we’ve not lost a single customer since we started.”",
