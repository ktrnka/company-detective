Perfect for building AI-powered applications.\n\nStart for free with 2 million tokens and 10GB of storage per month.\n\nOur mission is backed by premier venture capital firms known for funding transformative technology companies",
      "# [LiquidMetal AI](https://liquidmetal.ai/pricing)\nWhat is SmartBuckets?\n\nSmartBuckets is a new storage SaaS service by LiquidMetal AI. It's a smart layer that sits on top of a globally available, regionally aware object store; all built at the edge. It uses AI to index all the of the data you store in it automatically and offers a set of query API interfaces to make your life as a developer so much easier. Leverage knowledge about your content in ways you never imagined.\n\nHow does SmartBuckets make object storage \"smart\"?\n\nSmartBuckets uses AI to index and understand your data. By default, it indexes everything, so you can search the content and it's metadata using natural language. You can ask questions instead of writing code.\n\n\"PUT/GET/How many cats?\" – what are some other examples?\n\nYou can ask SmartBuckets things like: \"Does this document talk about Paris?,\" \"What's the most popular file in my bucket?\", \"What were the spreadsheets created last month?\", or even \"Is there any personal information (PII) in this file?\"\n\nHow much coding is needed?\n\nVery little! SmartBuckets is pretty much S3 compatible and works with your existing app storage interfaces. You don't have to rewrite your apps, just point them to the SmartBuckets API (PUT/GET/DELETE) and start asking questions from our query APIs. TypeScript, Go, Java, and Python SDKs are all supported.\n\nWill SmartBuckets make building my application faster?\n\nYes! AI-powered searching is much faster than looking through files manually or writing code to keep track of all of the metadata you need for your application. \"What is the most used file in this bucket?\" is now just a natural language question to the query APIs vs you have to write all of that code yourself. To learn more about the state-of-the-art indexer and retriever that make up SmartBuckets, check out our developer documentation.\n\nWhat about pricing?\n\nThere's a personal and business free tier with 10GB of storage and a monthly allotment of query tokens to get you started. After that, there are simple pricing plans based on usage. No hidden fees!\n\nWhat programming languages are supported?\n\nWe have SDKs for popular languages like Typescript, Python, Go, and Java. If you need something else, just reach out as we are always looking to make SmartBuckets easier to use for all developers.\n\nHow do I get started?\n\nThere's documentation and tutorials to help you get going quickly. With a free tier available to all, why not get started today?\n\nCan SmartBuckets help with GDPR?\n\nYes, SmartBuckets can help you find personal information (PII) in your data, which is important for GDPR and other privacy rules. Additionally, SmartBuckets is regionally aware so data from your EU users is stored in the EU while data from your Japanese users is stored in Japan; all without you having to do anything.",

In addition, if you fail to pay a Digital Marketplace for an Offering, we retain the right to enforce your payment obligations and collect directly from you. Any terms agreed between you and an Approved Source (other than us or a LiquidMetal Affiliate Distributor) that are in addition to these General Terms are solely between you and that Approved Source.

Some of the Open Source Software may have additional terms that apply to the use of the Offering (e.g., the obligation for us to provide attribution of the specific licensor), and those terms will be included in the Documentation. However, those terms will not: (i) impose any additional restrictions on your use of the Offering; or (ii) negate or amend our responsibilities with respect to the Offering.\n\n11. Third Party Extensions, Content and Products\n\nThird Party Extensions not built by LiquidMetal. We may make Third Party Extensions available from LiquidMetal’s Website. We do not represent, warrant or guarantee the accuracy, integrity, quality, or security of any Third Party Extension, even if that Third Party Extension is identified as “certified” or “validated” for use with the Offering. Your use of a Third Party Extension may be subject to additional terms, conditions or policies. We may block or disable access to a Third Party Extension at any time.\n\nThird Party Content. Hosted Services may contain features that enable interoperation with Third Party Content that you choose to add to a Hosted Service. You may be required to: (i) separately obtain access to Third Party Content from its provider; and (ii) grant us access to your accounts with those providers. By choosing to enable such interoperation by allowing us to enable access to Third Party Content, you: (a) certify that you are authorized to do so; and (b) authorize us to allow that provider to access Customer Content as necessary for interoperation. We are not responsible or liable for disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Content resulting from such interoperation, nor are we liable for damages or downtime or other impact on the Hosted Service, resulting directly or indirectly from your use of or reliance on Third Party Content, sites or resources.\n\n12. Your Compliance\n\n**Lawful Use of Offerings.**When you access and use an Offering, you are responsible for complying with all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to your access and use. This includes, without limitation, being responsible for your Customer Content and users, their compliance with these General Terms, how you acquired your Customer Content, and the accuracy and lawful use of your Customer Content.\n\nPHI, PCI Data and ITAR Data. You may not transmit or store PHI, PCI Data or ITAR Data within a Hosted Services unless you have specifically acquired an Offering for that applicable regulated Hosted Services environment.\n\nRegistration. You agree to provide accurate and complete information when you register for and use an Offering and agree to keep this information current. Each person who uses an Offering must have a separate username and password. For Hosted Services, you must provide a valid email address for each person authorized to use your Hosted Services. We may require additional information for certain Offerings (e.g., technical information necessary for your connection to a Hosted Service), and you will provide this information as we reasonably request. You are responsible for securing, protecting, and maintaining the confidentiality of your account usernames, passwords and access tokens.\n\nExport Compliance. You will comply with all applicable export laws and regulations of the United States (which apply irrespective of the use location of the Offerings) and any other country (“Export Laws”) where your users use any of the Offerings. You certify that you are not on any of the relevant U.S. government lists of prohibited persons, including the Treasury Department’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and the Commerce Department’s List of Denied Persons or Entity List. You will not export, re-export, ship, transfer or otherwise use the Offerings in any country subject to an embargo or other sanction by the United States, including, without limitation, Iran, Syria, Cuba, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, Sudan and North Korea, and you will not use any Offering for any purpose prohibited by the Export Laws.\n\n13. Confidentiality\n\nConfidential Information. Each party will protect the Confidential Information of the other. Accordingly, receiving party agrees to: (i) protect disclosing party’s Confidential Information using the same degree of care (but in no event less than reasonable care) that it uses to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature; (ii) limit use of disclosing party’s Confidential Information to only for purposes consistent with these General Terms; and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to limit access to disclosing party’s Confidential Information to its employees, contractors, agents, or Affiliates, each of which has a bona fide need to access such Confidential Information for purposes consistent with these General Terms, and who are subject to confidentiality obligations no less stringent than those set out here.\n\nCompelled Disclosure of Confidential Information. Despite the provisions above, receiving party may disclose Confidential Information of disclosing party if it is compelled by law enforcement agencies or regulators to do so, provided receiving party gives disclosing party prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at disclosing party’s cost, if disclosing party wishes to contest the disclosure. If receiving party is compelled to disclose disclosing party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which disclosing party is a party, and disclosing party is not contesting the disclosure, disclosing party will reimburse receiving party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information.\n\n14. Payment\n\nPayment Terms. The payment terms in this section 14 only apply when you purchase Offerings directly from us.\n\nFees. You agree to pay all Fees specified in the Orders. Fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except as otherwise expressly stated in these General Terms. Without limiting any of our other rights or remedies, overdue charges may accrue interest monthly at the rate of 1.5% of the then-outstanding unpaid balance, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower. Fees are due and payable either within 30 days from the date of our invoice or as otherwise stated in the Order.\n\nCredit Cards. For e-commerce transactions, if you choose to pay by credit or debit card, then you: (i) will provide us or our designated third party payment processor with valid credit or debit card information; and (ii) authorize us or our designated third party payment processor to charge such credit or debit card for all items listed in the applicable Order. Such charges must be paid in advance or in accordance with any different billing frequency stated in the applicable Order. You are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information and notifying us in a timely manner of any changes to such information.\n\nTaxes. Fees are exclusive of applicable taxes and duties, including any applicable sales and use tax. You are responsible for paying any taxes or similar government assessments (including, without limitation, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes). We will be solely responsible for taxes assessable against us based on our net income, property, and employees.\n\n15. Warranties\n\nRelationship to Applicable Law. You may have legal rights in your country that prohibit or restrict the limitations set out in this section 15, which applies only to the extent permitted under applicable law.\n\nGeneral Corporate Warranty. Each party warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into these General Terms.\n\nHosted Services Warranty. We warrant that during the Term: (i) we will not materially decrease the overall functionality of the Hosted Services; and (ii) the Hosted Services will perform materially in accordance with the Documentation. For any breach of these warranties, our entire liability, and your sole remedy, will be for us to: (a) modify or correct the Hosted Service so that it conforms to the foregoing warranty; or (b) if we determine that (a) is not commercially, technically or operationally reasonable, terminate the non-conforming Hosted Service, and refund to you any prepaid but unused Fees for the remainder of the Term.\n\nOn-Premises Product Warranty. We warrant that for a period of 90 days from its Delivery, the On-Premises Product will substantially perform the material functions described in the Documentation, when used in accordance with the Documentation. For any breach of this warranty, our entire liability, and your sole remedy, will be for us to: (i) modify, or provide an Enhancement for, the On-Premises Product so that it conforms to the foregoing warranty; (ii) replace your copy of the On-Premises Product with a copy that conforms to the foregoing warranty; or (iii) if we determine that (i) or (ii) is not commercially, technically or operationally reasonable, terminate the Offering with respect to the non-conforming On-Premises Product and refund to you the Fees paid for such non-conforming On-Premises Product.\n\nDisclaimer of Implied Warranties. Except as expressly set out above, and to the extent allowed by law, the Offerings are provided “AS IS” with no other warranties or representations whatsoever express or implied. We and our suppliers and licensors disclaim all warranties and representations not expressly set out above, including any implied warranties of merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, noninfringement, or quiet enjoyment, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or trade usage. We do not warrant that use of Offerings will be uninterrupted, error free or secure, or that all defects will be corrected.\n\n16. Ownership\n\nOfferings. As between you and us, we own and reserve all right, title, and interest in and to the Offerings and other LiquidMetal materials, including all Intellectual Property Rights therein. We retain rights in anything delivered or developed by us or on our behalf under these General Terms. No rights are granted to you other than as expressly set out in these General Terms.\n\nCustomer Content. You own and reserve all right, title and interest in your Customer Content. By sending Customer Content to a Hosted Service, you grant us a worldwide, royalty free, non-exclusive license to access and use the Customer Content for purposes of providing you the Hosted Service and as set out in the Specific Offering Terms. Subject to section 16.1, you own any reporting results that you or your Third Party Providers may derive from Customer Content through the use of the Offerings.\n\nFeedback. You have no obligation to provide us with any Feedback, unless otherwise stated in the Order. If you provide any Feedback, you grant to us a non-exclusive, transferable, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license (with rights to sublicense) to make, use, sell, offer to sell, reproduce, modify, distribute, make available, publicly display and perform, disclose and otherwise commercially exploit the Feedback.\n\n17. Term and Termination\n\nTerm and Renewal. These General Terms will start on the Effective Date and remain in effect until all your Offerings have expired, unless earlier terminated pursuant to this section 17. Termination of a specific Offering will not affect any other Offering. Terminating these General Terms will have the effect of terminating all Offerings. Grounds for terminating an Offering, that are specific to that Offering, will not be grounds for terminating Offerings where no breach exists. Unless indicated otherwise in the Order, the Term of an Offering that you acquired through an Order, along with these General Terms, will automatically renew for an additional period of time equal to the length of the preceding Term, unless one party notifies the other of its intent not to renew at least 1 day before the expiration of the then current Term.\n\nTermination. Either party may terminate these General Terms, or any Offering, by written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach of these General Terms, or the specific terms associated with that Offering, that is not cured within 30 days of receipt of the notice. Upon any expiration or termination of an Offering, the Use Rights granted to you for that Offering will automatically terminate, and you agree to immediately (i) cease using and accessing the Offering; (ii) return or destroy all copies of any On-Premises Products and other LiquidMetal materials and LiquidMetal Confidential Information in your possession or control; and (iii) upon our request, certify in writing the completion of such return or destruction. Unless stated otherwise in these General Terms, upon termination of these General Terms or any Offering, we will have no obligation to refund any Fees or other amounts received from you during the Term. Despite any early termination above, and except for your termination of an Offering for our uncured material breach, you will still be required to pay all Fees payable under the Order.\n\nRefund Upon Termination for our Breach. If an Offering is terminated by you for our uncured material breach, we will refund you any prepaid but unused Fees covering the remainder of the Term after the effective date of termination.\n\nSurvival. The termination or expiration of these General Terms will not affect any provisions which, by their nature, survive termination or expiration, including the provisions that deal with the following subject matters: definitions, ownership of intellectual property, confidentiality, payment obligations, effect of termination, limitation of liability, privacy, and the “Miscellaneous” section in these General Terms.\n\nSuspension of Service. In the event of a material breach or threatened material breach of these General Terms, upon at least 5 days’ notice, we may, without limiting our other rights and remedies, suspend your use of the Hosted Service until such breach is cured or we reasonably believe there is no longer a threat. Suspension of a Hosted Service will have no impact on the duration of the Term of the Offering, or the associated Fees owed.\n\n18. Limitation of Liability\n\nEach party’s aggregate liability, together with any of its Affiliates, arising out of or related to these General Terms will not, in any event, exceed the total amount paid by you for the affected Offering in the 12 months preceding the first incident out of which the liability arose. This liability cap does not limit: (i) your obligations under the “Payment” section above; (ii) your rights to any service level credits under any applicable Service Level Schedule; and (iii) our right to recover amounts for your use of an Offering in excess of the Capacity purchased or outside of your Internal Business Purpose.\n\nIn no event will either party or its Affiliates have any liability arising out of or related to these General Terms for any lost profits, revenues, goodwill, or indirect, special, incidental, consequential, cover, business interruption or punitive damages.\n\nThe limitations above apply whether the action is in contract or tort and regardless of the theory of liability, even if a party or its Affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages or if a party’s or its Affiliates’ remedy otherwise fails of its essential purpose.\n\nThe limitations above do not apply to your violation of the Use Rights limits in section 1.2 or either party’s: (a) infringement of the Intellectual Property Rights; (b) indemnification obligations; or (c) fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n\nThe limitations in this section do not apply to the extent prohibited by law. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain damages to be excluded or limited. To the extent such a law applies to you, some or all of the exclusions or limitations above may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights.\n\n19. Indemnity\n\nOur Indemnification to You. We will defend and indemnify you, and pay all damages (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) awarded against you, or that are agreed to in a settlement, to the extent a claim, demand, suit or proceeding is made or brought against you or your Affiliates by a third party (including those brought by a government entity) alleging that your use of an Offering infringes or misappropriates such third party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (a “Customer Claim”). We will have no obligation under the foregoing provision to the extent a Customer Claim arises from your breach of these General Terms, your Customer Content, Third Party Extension, or the combination of the Offering with: (i) Customer Content; (ii) Third Party Extensions; (iii) any software other than software provided by us; or (iv) any hardware or equipment. However, we will indemnify against combination claims to the extent: (a) the combined software is necessary for the normal operation of the Offering (e.g., an operating system); or (b) the Offering provides substantially all the essential elements of the asserted infringement or misappropriation claim. We may in our sole discretion and at no cost to you: (1) modify an Offering so that it no longer infringes or misappropriates a third party right; (2) obtain a license for your continued use of the Offering, in accordance with these General Terms; or (3) terminate the Offering and refund to you any prepaid fees covering the unexpired Term.\n\nYour Indemnification to Us. Unless expressly prohibited by applicable law, you will defend and indemnify us, and pay all damages (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) awarded against us, or that are agreed to in a settlement, to the extent a claim, demand, suit or proceeding is made or brought against us or our Affiliates by a third party (including those brought by a government entity) that: (i) alleges that your Customer Content infringes or misappropriates such third party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret, or violates another right of a third party; or (ii) alleges that your Customer Content or your use of any Offering violates applicable law or regulation.\n\nMutual Indemnity. Each party will defend, indemnify, and pay all damages (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) awarded against the other party, or that are agreed to in a settlement to the extent that an action brought against the other party by a third party is based upon a claim for bodily injury (including death) to any person, or damage to tangible property resulting from the negligent acts or willful misconduct of the indemnifying party or its personnel. Each party will pay any reasonable, direct, out-of-pocket costs, damages and reasonable attorneys’ fees attributable to such claims that are awarded against the indemnified party (or are payable in settlement by the indemnified party).\n\nProcess for Indemnification. The indemnification obligations above are subject to the party seeking indemnification: (i) providing the other party with prompt written notice of the specific claim; (ii) giving the indemnifying party sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim (except that the indemnifying party may not settle any claim that requires any action or forbearance on the indemnified party’s part without its prior consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and (iii) giving the indemnifying party all reasonable assistance, at such party’s expense.\n\nFrom time to time, we may update or modify our Offerings and policies with prospective effect, provided that such change or modification: (i) applies to all our customers generally; (ii) does not impose additional fees or restrictions on your use of the Offering during the Term; (iii) does not override or supersede the risk allocation between us under these General Terms, including without limitation the terms under sections 18 (Limitation of Liability) and 19 (Indemnity); and (iv) does not materially reduce the security protections or overall functionality of the applicable Offering during the Term.\n\n21. Governing Law\n\nThese General Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, as if performed wholly within the state and without giving effect to the principles of conflict of law. Any legal action or proceeding arising under these General Terms will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the Northern District of California and the parties consent to that venue and personal jurisdiction. We may seek injunctive or other relief in any state, federal, or national court of competent jurisdiction for any actual or alleged: (i) breach of confidentiality obligations; (ii) infringement of intellectual property or other proprietary rights of LiquidMetal, our Affiliates or any third party; or (iii) violations of the Use Rights limits in section 1.2. You agree that such breach, infringement or violation likely causes irreparable harm. Neither the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act nor the United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods will apply to these General Terms.\n\n22. Use of Customer Name\n\nWe may add your name to our customer list, identify you as our customer on our websites and publicly use your name and logo in connection with our marketing activities (e.g., press releases). Nothing in these General Terms gives you a right to use LiquidMetal’s name, logo, or marks for any reason.\n\n23. Miscellaneous\n\nDifferent Terms. We expressly reject terms or conditions in any Customer purchase order or other similar document that are different from or additional to these General Terms. Such different or additional terms and conditions will not become a part of the agreement between the parties despite any subsequent acknowledgement, invoice or license key that we may issue.\n\nNo Future Functionality; Discontinuation. You agree that your purchase of any Offering is not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features, or dependent on any oral or written statements made by us regarding future functionality or features. You acknowledge and agree that, subject to our Support Policy and commitment during the Term, we may in our sole discretion discontinue the manufacture, development, sale, or support of any Offering, at any time and without any liability.\n\nNotices. Except as otherwise specified in these General Terms, all notices related to these General Terms will be sent in writing to the addresses in the Order, or to such other addresses as may be specified by either party to the other. Notices will be effective upon: (i) personal delivery; (ii) the second business day after mailing; or (iii) if sent by email, the day of sending. However, any notices relating to termination or an indemnifiable claim must be clearly marked as a legal notice, and must not be sent by email. Billing-related notices to you will be addressed to your relevant designated billing contact. All other notices to you will be addressed to your relevant designated system administrator.\n\nAssignment. Neither party may assign, delegate, or transfer these General Terms, in whole or in part, by agreement, operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other party. However, we may assign these General Terms in whole or in part to an Affiliate or in connection with an internal reorganization or a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets to which these General Terms relates. Any attempt to assign these General Terms other than as permitted in these General Terms will be void. Subject to the foregoing, these General Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties’ permitted successors and assigns.\n\nWaiver; Severability. The waiver by either party of a breach of or a default under any of these General Terms will not be effective unless in writing. Either party’s failure to enforce any provisions of these General Terms will not constitute a waiver of any other right hereunder or of any subsequent enforcement of that or any other provisions. If any provision of these General Terms is deemed by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the rest of these General Terms will remain in full force and effect, and the provision affected will be construed so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permissible by law.\n\nIntegration; Entire Agreement. These General Terms, along with any additional terms incorporated by reference, constitute the complete agreement between the parties regarding the subject of these General Terms, and replace and supersede all previous agreements, communications and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to their subject matter. Except as otherwise expressly set out in these General Terms, any waiver or amendment of any provision of these General Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by duly authorized representatives of both parties.\n\nNo Reliance. In acquiring and using an Offering, you agree that you have had the opportunity to conduct independent due diligence with respect to that Offering, are relying on that due diligence as well as these General Terms and any additional terms incorporated by reference, and are expressly not relying on any other terms, agreements, communications, or understandings, whether written or oral, relating to their subject matter.\n\nForce Majeure. Neither party or its Affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, agents, partners and licensors will (except for the obligation to make any payments) be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under these General Terms where the delay or failure results from any cause beyond their reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, labor disputes or other industrial disturbances, electrical, telecommunications, or other utility failures, earthquake, storms or other elements of nature, blockades, embargoes, riots, acts or orders of government, acts of terrorism, or war.\n\nIndependent Contractors; No Third Party Beneficiaries. The parties are independent contractors. These General Terms do not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary, or employment relationship between the parties. There are no third party beneficiaries of these General Terms. Neither party has the authority to bind or act on behalf of the other party in any capacity or circumstance whether by contract or otherwise.\n\n24.

      "# [Creating an AI agent in Typescript on 2024-12-01](https://liquidmetal.ai/casesAndBlogs/agents/)\nIntroduction\n\nSo you’ve decided to build an AI agent. That’s an exciting first step into a rapidly evolving field. While there’s no shortage of impressive tools and deep dive content available, you’ll quickly discover that navigating through the maze of offerings can be overwhelming. What started as an inspiring project can swiftly turn into a dizzying journey through countless technological rabbit holes.\n\nThe landscape is filled with compelling platforms and frameworks for building agents. However, a common pattern emerges: many of these platforms are best at creating polished demos that run smoothly on your laptop. Their developer experience (DevEx) shines in getting you from zero to one, showcasing quick wins and immediate results. But when faced with real-world scaling challenges, these same platforms often become unwieldy. The initial simplicity that made them attractive transforms into technical debt, and what once facilitated rapid development becomes a bottleneck in resolving critical issues.\n\nOur philosophy takes a different approach. Instead of constraining developers with opinionated frameworks, we believe in empowering them with fundamental building blocks. By providing core components that handle the essential yet time-consuming aspects of AI agent development, we enable developers to focus on what matters most: building robust, scalable solutions tailored to their specific needs.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll describe the essential architecture and components of an AI agent, demonstrating how to build one using LiquidMetal’s Raindrop. While we’ve chosen our platform for this demonstration, it’s worth noting that the code we’ll write is pure TypeScript, making it platform-agnostic and readily adaptable to your preferred environment. Whether you’re building on our platform or incorporating these concepts into your own stack, the principles and patterns we’ll discuss remain universally applicable.\n\nWhat are AI Agents\n\nAn AI agent is a sophisticated software system that combines artificial intelligence with autonomous decision-making capabilities. Unlike traditional software that simply follows predefined rules, AI agents can understand, reason, plan, and learn from their interactions, making them more adaptable and capable of handling complex tasks.\n\nAt their core, AI agents typically consist of several key components:\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) serve as the brain, enabling the agent to understand and generate human-like text, reason about problems, and process information in sophisticated ways.\n\nA memory system allows the agent to retain context and information from past interactions, making it more coherent and effective over extended conversations or tasks.\n\nPlanning and reasoning modules help the agent break down complex tasks into manageable steps and determine the best approach to achieve its goals. Tool capabilities enable the agent to interact with external systems, APIs, and databases, expanding what it can accomplish beyond just conversation.\n\nWe will discuss each component in more detail in the sections below.\n\nThe Agent Loop\n\nAt the core of every AI agent lies the agent loop - a process that drives decision-making and action execution. While implementations can vary significantly in complexity, most basic structures consists of two primary steps that repeat until either the task is completed or the maximum reasoning depth is reached: reason and act [1][Yao et. all.].\n\nThe Reasoning Phase\n\nDuring the reasoning phase, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the agent’s brain, evaluating all available information to determine the optimal next step. This phase involves analyzing the current context, understanding the task requirements, and planning the most effective course of action.\n\nIn our implementation the LLM might decide to:\n\nDraw upon its semantic knowledge - A basic set of indexed information that represent our agents knowledge about the world.\n\nAccess information stored in memory systems, whether short-term context (current chat interaction) or long-term stored information (interactions accross multiple chats)\n\nIdentify which tools would be most appropriate for the current task\n\nIt is generally recommended to limit the agent loop depth to avoid trapping it in an endless loop\n\nThe Action Phase\n\nFollowing the reasoning phase, the agent executes the chosen action. This could involve retrieving specific information from memory, utilizing one or more tools, or synthesizing a final response if the agent determines it has gathered all necessary information and completed all required actions.\n\nExample\n\nThe diagram above illustrates a high-level overview of an agent loop, depicting how it cycles through reasoning and action phases. To better understand this process in practice, let’s look at how an agent processes a common question through multiple iterations.\n\nAssume the system is presented with the following input query: “What is the capital of France and what is the weather in this city right now?”\n\nThis question, requires multiple processing steps for an agent to ensure accuracy.\n\nThe first loop begins with a reasoning phase where the agent evaluates the initial component of the question - identifying France’s capital. Despite language models often containing this information in their training data, the agent follows its directive to verify facts through authorized sources. The reasoning phase concludes that querying the semantic knowledge endpoint will provide the most reliable answer. In the act phase the agent pulls the relevant info from the semantic endpoint.\n\nMoving into the second loop, the agent has confirmed Paris as France’s capital through the semantic endpoint. The reasoning phase now focuses on the weather component of the question. Recognizing that current weather data requires real-time information, the agent determines it must utilize the weather tool, passing “Paris” as the location parameter.\n\nThe third loop brings all pieces together. With both the verified capital information and current weather data in hand, the reasoning phase determines no additional information is needed. The agent synthesizes its gathered data into a complete response: “The capital of France is Paris and the current weather is 72F.”\n\nThis example demonstrates the basics of the agent loop architecture. Each loop builds upon previous knowledge, creating a reliable path from question to answer through verified data and structured reasoning.\n\nAI Agent Implementation\n\nIn the following sections we are taking a deep dive into an agentic AI implementation in typescript. In this example we are creating an AI agent that has access to a semantic knowledge endpoint, various tools such as weather and news API’s and memory stores.\n\nReasoning and Acting\n\nFirst we implement the main agent loop including the reasoning and acting phase. This is built around a TypeScript method called processInput that takes two parameters: the user’s input as a string and an optional maximum depth limit (defaulting to 10 iterations).\n\nThe method starts by maintaining a conversation context array, adding each user input as it arrives. It then enters a while loop that continues until either we reach a final answer or hit our maximum depth limit. This depth limit is crucial for production systems - without it, complex queries could potentially trap the agent in endless loops.\n\nInside the main loop, we make an API call to Groq’s LLM service. The API call includes two key elements: a system message that defines our agent’s capabilities and response format requirements, and a user message containing the current conversation context. We deliberately set the response format to json_object, forcing the model to provide structured output that our code can reliably parse and act upon.\n\nThe system message defines our agent’s interface with its tools. For each tool - whether it’s checking the weather, fetching news, or accessing memory systems - we specify exact JSON schemas for the required arguments. For example, the weather tool expects a city name and optional country/state codes, while the news tool needs a search query and optional date range. This strict typing helps prevent runtime errors from malformed tool calls.\n\nAfter receiving the LLM’s response, our code handles three possible paths:\n\nIf the model decides to provide an answer, we store it and set our completion flag to true\n\nIf the model chooses to use a tool, we call that tool with the provided arguments and add its response to our context\n\nIf anything goes wrong (like JSON parsing errors), we catch and handle the error appropriately\n\nThe error handling is particularly thorough given the nondetermenistic nature of LLMs - we wrap our JSON parsing in try-catch blocks and include detailed logging statements. This makes debugging easier in production environments where we can’t directly observe the agent’s behavior.\n\nWhen the loop concludes - either through finding an answer or hitting the depth limit - the final response gets added to our conversation context before being returned. This maintains a complete record of the interaction, which becomes valuable context for future queries to the same agent instance.\n\nWhile we strictly control the format of our LLM’s responses, we place no restrictions on which tools it can use or in what order. This allows the agent to develop complex, multi-step solutions while preventing the most common failure modes in agentic systems.\n\nMain agent loop implementation\n\n/** * Main processing function that handles user input and generates responses. * This implements the core reasoning loop: * 1. Add user input to conversation history * 2. Ask Groq LLM to reason about what's needed * 3. Either use a tool (weather, news) or provide final answer * 4.

In your answer, include code in a code block if any was generated\" }` }, { role: 'user', content: `Current context:\\n${this.context.join('\\n')}\\n\\nWhat should be done next?` }], temperature: 0.7, response_format: { type: \"json_object\" } // Force JSON output }) }); // Get response as text for logging/debugging const responseBody = await reasoningResponse.text(); console.log('API Response:', responseBody); try { // Parse the nested JSON responses const reasoningData = JSON.parse(responseBody); const reasoning = JSON.parse(reasoningData.choices[0].message.content); // Handle the AI's decision - either provide final answer or use a tool if (reasoning.action === 'provide_answer') { // We have enough information - store the answer and complete finalAnswer = reasoning.answer; isComplete = true; } else if (reasoning.action === 'use_tool') { // We need more information - call the appropriate tool const toolResult = await this.useTool(reasoning.tool, reasoning.arguments); // If the tool returned useful information, add it to context if (toolResult.success && toolResult.data.content) { this.context.push(`Tool Result (${reasoning.tool}): Information received: ${JSON.stringify(toolResult.data.content, null, 2)} What would you like to do with this information?`); } else { // Tool failed - log error and add failure note to context console.error('Tool did not return useful information:', toolResult.error); this.context.push(`Tool (${reasoning.tool}) failed to provide useful information.`); } } } catch (error) { // Handle any JSON parsing errors console.error('JSON Parsing Error:', error); throw error; } currentDepth++; } // If we hit max depth without completing, return an error message if (!isComplete) { finalAnswer = `I apologize, but I was unable to reach a conclusion within the maximum allowed ${maxDepth} reasoning steps.`; } // Add the final answer to context and return it this.context.push(`Assistant: ${finalAnswer}`); return finalAnswer; }\n\nTools are the fundamental components that enable AI agents to interact with the external world and perform concrete actions. While the language model serves as the agent’s reasoning engine, tools provide the actual capabilities to execute specific tasks, access external systems, and manipulate data in meaningful ways. For tools to be usable by the AI, we need to provide clear definitions of their required parameters during the acting phase of our agent loop.\n\nIn our implementation, we’ve equipped the agent with access to a weather API, a news API, and memory components. The memory implementation is currently a placeholder to keep this example straightforward - in a production environment, you’ll want to replace these with more robust memory retrieval components.\n\nThe tool selection mechanism itself is straightforward, implemented through a switch statement that processes the output from the agent’s reasoning phase. The selected tool executes its function and returns the gathered information back to the main agent loop, where it becomes input for the next reasoning step. Here’s the implementation:\n\nTools Implementation\n\n/** * Tool handling function that provides access to different capabilities. * Available tools: * - weather: Get current weather for a location using OpenWeatherMap API * - news: Get news articles based on search query using NewsAPI * - short_term_memory: Access current conversation context * - long_term_memory: Access historical conversations (currently mocked) * * @param tool - Name of the tool to use * @param args - Arguments to pass to the tool * @returns ToolResponse containing success/failure and any returned data */ private async useTool(tool: string, args: any): Promise<ToolResponse> { switch (tool) { // Get news articles based on a search query case 'news': console.log(\"in news tool\"); const { query, fromDate } = args; try { const newsResponse = await fetch( `https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?` + `q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}` + `${fromDate ? `&from=${fromDate}` : ''}` + `&sortBy=popularity` + `&apiKey=${this.env.NEWS_API_KEY}`, { headers: { 'User-Agent': 'LiquidMetal AI Agent/1.0', 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } } ); if (!newsResponse.ok) { console.error('News API error:', await newsResponse.text()); return { success: false, data: null, error: `Failed to fetch news: ${newsResponse.status} ${newsResponse.statusText}` }; } const newsData = await newsResponse.json(); // Check if we got any articles if (!newsData.articles || newsData.articles.length === 0) { return { success: false, data: null, error: 'No news articles found' }; } return { success: true, data: { type: 'news', content: { articles: newsData.articles.slice(0, 5) // Only return top 5 articles } } }; } catch (error) { console.error('News API error:', error); return { success: false, data: null, error: `Failed to fetch news: ${error.message}` }; } // Get the current weather in a given city using OpenWeatherMap API case 'weather': console.log(\"in weather tool\"); const { city, country = '', state = '' } = args; const location = [city, state, country].filter(Boolean).join(','); const weatherResponse = await fetch( `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${location}&appid=${this.env.WEATHER_API_KEY}` ); if (!weatherResponse.ok) { return { success: false, data: null, error: 'Location not found' }; } const weatherData = await weatherResponse.json(); return { success: true, data: { type: 'weather', content: weatherData } }; // Access the current conversation history stored in context case 'short_term_memory': console.log(\"in short term memory tool\"); return { success: true, data: { type: 'conversation', content: this.context } }; // Access past conversations (currently returns mock data) case 'long_term_memory': console.log(\"in long term memory tool\"); return { success: true, data: { type: 'past_conversations', content: 'There are no long term memories yet' } }; // Handle unknown tool requests default: return { success: false, data: null, error: 'Unknown tool' }; } }\n\nThe Raindrop Manifest\n\nThe Raindrop manifest provides an easy way to deploy our agent application on the Raindrop platform. Think of this manifest as a blueprint that defines your application’s structure and its required components. For this demonstration, we’re keeping things minimal - we only need to specify a single service and the API keys required for authentication.\n\nThe manifest below defines our application named “agent-template”. It specifies three secret environment variables for our API keys (Groq, Weather, and News) and sets up a public-facing service that will host our agent. The service configuration includes a domain specification where your agent will be accessible.\n\nRaindrop Manifest\n\napplication \"agent-template\" { // You need to set all the required API keys using the CLI // raindrop build env set agent-template:env:<API_KEY_NAME> <API KEY> // groq api key env \"GROQ_API_KEY\" { secret = true } // weather API env \"WEATHER_API_KEY\" { secret = true } // news API env \"NEWS_API_KEY\" { secret = true } // agent service service \"agent\" { visibility = \"public\" domain { // this is the domain to query your agent update the ID with your org ID from liquidmetal.ai fqdn = \"agent.<YOUR ORG ID>.lmapp.run\" } } }\n\nOnce you have created this manifest, deployment is straightforward.\n\nFirst, run raindrop build generate to create all the necessary resources based on your manifest. Next, add your TypeScript implementation to the project directory. Finally, execute raindrop build deploy to deploy your application to the platform.\n\nNote that the code we’ve explored in previous sections - the agent loop and tools implementation - is part of a larger application structure. The complete project includes additional components for handling service requests and a main agent class that ties everything together. You’ll find all these components in our source code repository, which we’ll link to in the next section.\n\nProject Source Code\n\nYou can download the entire source code for this project from our GitHub repository. To deploy it in its current form, you’ll need a LiquidMetal account, which you can create at liquidmetal.ai/build. By using our platform, we handle all the infrastructure setup and ensure your project has access to all required resources.\n\nIf you prefer to deploy independently, you can set up a TypeScript-compatible environment on your preferred cloud provider. Note that this approach may require modifications to the code, particularly around secrets management and resource availability.\n\nReferences"

IMO anything with just a vector is not going to have the performance you need for a real use case. \n\nI would start by understanding the data type you are indexing for your RAG. Decide how you are going to break that up into core components. For example if you index PDFs, are you just looking at the text or are you including images, tables etc? \n\nI wrote a whole blog series about it here in case that is helpful: [https://liquidmetal.ai/blog/sota-rag-intro/](https://liquidmetal.ai/blog/sota-rag-intro/)\n\n## Comment ID ltkn10e with +4 score by [(ore0s, Reddit, 2024-10-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1gb59uc/agent_tech_stack/ltkn10e/) (in reply to ID 1gb59uc):\nYou can get an initial MVP up and running quickly w/ out of the box models like Claude Computer Use or GPT-4-vision, combine that with your in-house agent planning framework connected to a Chrome extension or desktop app. Then for efficient serving, leverage pgvector with PostgreSQL to keep it simple, and sometimes even simple \"hardcoded\" keyword parsing with regex in your Next.js routes can suffice to serve up a demo.  \n\nBut the real challenge lies in collecting real world feedback & fine-tuning these models. Setting up the infrastructure to collect a substantial amount of success and failure cases—or establishing a customer feedback system—is complex and requires creativity & lots of experimentation. For instance, how do you formalize scenarios where the agent doesn't take the same action due to factors like unexpected layout changes, not waiting long enough before acting, or differing planning sequences compared to previous runs? And ultimately, how do you feed that feedback back into your out-of-the-box model, which relies on embeddings to search for potentially \"hardcoded\" action plans and user context from your pgvector database?\n\nI'm genuinely curious—what solutions are you all using to address these challenges?\n\n## Comment ID ltl5qs9 with +2 score by [(Nedomas, Reddit, 2024-10-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1gb59uc/agent_tech_stack/ltl5qs9/) (in reply to ID 1gb59uc):\nPlain OpenAI Assistants API for brain, [Superinterface](https://superinterface.ai) for AI UI infra\n\n## Comment ID ltn9zxe with +1 score by [(nnet3, Reddit, 2024-10-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1gb59uc/agent_tech_stack/ltn9zxe/) (in reply to ID 1gb59uc):\nhttps://www.helicone.ai/blog/llm-stack-guide\n\n## Comment ID ltnbp7p with +1 score by [(AsliReddington, Reddit, 2024-10-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1gb59uc/agent_tech_stack/ltnbp7p/) (in reply to ID 1gb59uc):\nSGlang with structured output, Qdrant & plain REST calls for everything else.\n\n## Comment ID ltnl4eq with +1 score by [(rezashun, Reddit, 2024-10-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1gb59uc/agent_tech_stack/ltnl4eq/) (in reply to ID 1gb59uc):\nI saw something called Ragflow, like a low code platform to implement the logic\n\n## Comment ID ltso2dg with +1 score by [(agenticbehavior, Reddit, 2024-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1gb59uc/agent_tech_stack/ltso2dg/) (in reply to ID 1gb59uc):\nHave you checked out https://github.com/AgentOps-AI/AgentStack ?\n\n## Comment ID ltta2tj with +1 score by [(Latter-Tour-9213, Reddit, 2024-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1gb59uc/agent_tech_stack/ltta2tj/) (in reply to ID 1gb59uc):\nDepending on the type of AI agent. If the agent is not the type that gradually inject knowledge but have all knowledge injected at once for RAG and those knowledge stay fixed ( think an Agent for selling a real estate ), then GraphRAG is currently the most superior approach over any other RAG i am sure, and Microsoft azure actually has a RAG service for graphRAG thats production ready for you off the bat, just need to build an agentic system around that\n\n### Comment ID lttaaep with +1 score by [(Latter-Tour-9213, Reddit, 2024-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1gb59uc/agent_tech_stack/lttaaep/) (in reply to ID ltta2tj):\nThe reason why graph RAG i dont think it be so nice for AI agent of gradual knowledge injection ( not fixed size knowledge ) such as AI friend is because it is such an expensive approach, it is very expensive to do graphrag the more data you have; it runs tons of LLM calls.
