  "summary_markdown": "# About Bungie\n\nBungie, Inc. is a prominent American video game developer headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. The company was founded in May 1991 by Alex Seropian and Jason Jones. Initially, Bungie focused on developing games for the Macintosh platform, gaining early recognition with titles like *Marathon* and *Myth* [(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie). Bungie is best known for creating the *Halo* series and the *Destiny* franchise, both of which have had significant impacts on the gaming industry.\n\nBungie operates primarily in the B2C market, targeting gamers who enjoy immersive multiplayer experiences. The company generates revenue through game sales, expansions, and in-game purchases. Bungie's flagship product, *Destiny 2*, is a live-service game that includes regular expansions and seasonal content. The company also engages its community through forums, clan management, and events [(Bungie.net, 2023)](https://www.bungie.net/).\n\nBungie has undergone several significant changes over time. It was acquired by Microsoft in 2000, which led to the development of the *Halo* franchise for the Xbox console. Bungie regained its independence in 2007 but continued to work on the *Halo* series under a partnership with Microsoft. In 2010, Bungie signed a ten-year publishing deal with Activision, which ended in 2019, allowing Bungie to self-publish its *Destiny* franchise. In January 2022, Sony acquired Bungie for $3.6 billion, intending to expand Bungie's capabilities while maintaining its independence as a multi-platform studio [(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\nAs of October 2023, Bungie had approximately 1,600 employees, but significant layoffs in 2023 and 2024 reduced the workforce to about 850 employees [(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie). These layoffs were part of broader cost-cutting measures across Sony studios due to a decline in revenue from *Destiny 2* and challenges in developing the next major expansion, *The Final Shape* [(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nPete Parsons has been the CEO of Bungie since January 2016. Under his leadership, the company has navigated significant transitions, including the acquisition by Sony and the restructuring of the company. Parsons has been vocal about the challenges faced by the company, particularly following the layoffs, stating that the decisions were made \"after exhausting all other mitigation options\" [(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n# News\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n- **Destiny 2 Content Updates**: In September 2024, Bungie announced a new release model for *Destiny 2*, featuring two medium-sized paid expansions annually, alongside four major free content updates. This change aims to address player feedback regarding the game's structure and replayability [(Eurogamer, 2024-09-09)](https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-announces-major-changes-for-destiny-2-two-medium-expansions-coming-a-year).\n\n- **Layoffs and Financial Challenges**: Bungie has faced significant financial challenges, leading to layoffs of around 100 employees in October 2023 and an additional 220 in July 2024. These layoffs were part of cost-cutting measures due to a 45% decline in revenue from *Destiny 2* [(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n- **Future Projects**: Bungie is working on a new title, *Marathon*, expected to launch in 2025, alongside ongoing support for *Destiny 2*. The company faces challenges in balancing resources between these projects, especially in light of recent layoffs and financial pressures [(Forbes, 2024-03-27)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/03/27/how-can-bungie-sustain-both-destiny-2-and-marathon-going-forward/).\n\n## Community and Industry Feedback\n\n- **Community Sentiment**: The community sentiment around Bungie has been mixed, particularly following the layoffs and the perceived decline in *Destiny 2*'s popularity. There have been calls for accountability from Bungie's management, and concerns have been raised about the company's internal dynamics, including allegations of a male-dominated environment and issues with crunch time [(Forbes, 2024-03-27)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/03/27/how-can-bungie-sustain-both-destiny-2-and-marathon-going-forward/).\n\n- **Industry Trends**: Bungie's acquisition by Sony was a strategic move to bolster Sony's presence in the live-service game market. The deal was expected to help Bungie expand its development team and explore new media opportunities beyond video games [(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n## Recent News Articles\n\n- \"New Destiny 2 Arc Abilities Revealed For Episode: Heresy\" [(Hayley Williams, GameSpot, 2025-01-17)](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-destiny-2-arc-abilities-revealed-for-episode-heresy/1100-6528871/).\n- \"Destiny 2 New Dungeon Sundered Doctrine: Release Date, Race Details, And Everything To Know\" [(Blair Marnell, GameSpot, 2025-01-17)](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-new-dungeon-sundered-doctrine-release-date-race-details-and-everything-to-know/1100-6528872/).\n- \"Bungie team reportedly developing a MOBA game with Super Smash Bros-style elements\" [(Pulasthi Ariyasinghe, Neowin, 2025-01-11)](https://www.neowin.net/news/bungie-team-reportedly-developing-a-moba-game-with-super-smash-bros-style-elements/).\n\nBungie's ability to adapt and innovate will be crucial for its future success as it navigates the complexities of its recent acquisition by Sony and the evolving landscape of live-service games.",

      "# Post ID l6jzpb: Halo.bungie.net data archive almost done, thank you u/B1GSTACK with +159 score by [(SeankeyKong, Reddit, 2021-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/l6jzpb/halobungienet_data_archive_almost_done_thank_you/)\nu/B1GSTACK has been archiving as much of the data from [halo.bungie.net](https://halo.bungie.net) as possible before time runs out. Thank you!\n\nHe made a site too: [https://halo.statrepo.com/](https://halo.statrepo.com/) so you can enter your gamertag and get your stats.  Sounds like there's hopes of an api coming in time, but I know that will take some time, especially for  hobby project...\n\nI'll also just add that this is not a cheap feat to accomplish... the site above says \"Hosted by [Bstack.NET](https://Bstack.NET)\" at the bottom.  I checked it out, looks like a typical hosting site with the services you'd expect, but that seems like it'd be a good way to support him if you're looking for hosting.  Looks like a smaller company to me, so it might be better to give your money to them vs just going with another one of the big guys...\n\nI'm just so happy someone took this on.  I know a lot of people aren't that interested in this data, or the site itself, but I know it was and is important to at least some of us.\n\nThanks again, u/B1GSTACK!\n\nEdit:\n\nSome of you have asked for updates, so here's one.  Halo 2 data is almost done being loaded.  The database in total looks like it will end up being \\~3.8 TB.  Front end is under construction.  Thanks for your patience everyone, a reminder that the team doing all this all have day jobs, so just like Halo Infinite, it will be ready when it's ready haha.\n\nu/B1GSTACK said he's going to work on a Patreon for anyone that wants to contribute.  The amount of people that care about this is probably not a huge number, but the amount of resources that went into scouring and archiving all the data is pretty hefty, and I think any contribution would help, if nothing more than a sign of appreciation.  Nothing's up yet, but we'll update once it is!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1/16/2022 Edit: \n\nSeveral users have inquired about seeing their service record via archive.org in the mean time, so I want to lay that out for you here.  First, you should check if a wayback machine snapshot exists at all for your gamertag (replace the REPLACE\\_THIS\\_WITH\\_YOUR\\_GAMERTAG text with your gamertag): \n\n[https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=http://halo.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/default.aspx?player=REPLACE\\_THIS\\_WITH\\_YOUR\\_GAMERTAG&output=json&from=1996&to=2021&filter=statuscode:200](https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=http://halo.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/default.aspx?player=rocketman287&output=json&from=1996&to=2021&filter=statuscode:200)\n\nIt will return a list of snapshots available.  If it returns \\[ \\] only, then unfortunately your service record was not captured by wayback machine while [halo.bungie.net](https://halo.bungie.net) was active.  I'm among those, so you aren't alone.\n\nNext, if it does return a list, all you need to do is adjust the following to view any snapshot of your service record:\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/REPLACE\\_THIS\\_WITH\\_TIMESTAMP/http://halo.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/default.aspx?player=R](https://web.archive.org/web/20210115220340/http://halo.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/default.aspx?player=sangh3ilisold3r)EPLACE\\_THIS\\_WITH\\_GAMERTAG\n\nLastly, you can repeat the above process with any url of interest, like the Halo ODST, Halo 3, Halo2 career stats, file share, etc... (the tabs across the top of player service record)\n\n[http://halo.bungie.net/stats/halo3/careerstatsodst.aspx?player=R](http://halo.bungie.net/stats/halo3/careerstatsodst.aspx?player=Rocketman287)EPLACE\\_GAMERTAG\n\n[http://halo.bungie.net/stats/halo3/careerstats.aspx?player=](http://halo.bungie.net/stats/halo3/careerstats.aspx?player=Rocketman287)[R](http://halo.bungie.net/stats/halo3/careerstatsodst.aspx?player=Rocketman287)EPLACE\\_GAMERTAG\n\n[http://halo.bungie.net/stats/playerstatshalo2.aspx?player=](http://halo.bungie.net/stats/playerstatshalo2.aspx?player=Rocketman287)[R](http://halo.bungie.net/stats/halo3/careerstatsodst.aspx?player=Rocketman287)EPLACE\\_GAMERTAG\n\n[http://halo.bungie.net/stats/halo3/fileshare.aspx?player=](http://halo.bungie.net/stats/halo3/fileshare.aspx?player=Rocketman287)[R](http://halo.bungie.net/stats/halo3/careerstatsodst.aspx?player=Rocketman287)EPLACE\\_GAMERTAG\n\nIt might take some iteration since each link might be timestamp independent.  I.e. fileshare url might have snapshots, but the file urls themselves might have been captured in a different snapshot or not at all.\n\n9/12/2022\n\nHey everyone, I figured I'd post a benign update since it's been a while.  Obviously things really slowed down on this project.  I had some life changes, and u/B1GSTACK and his team had some other stuff come up too.  There have been discussions of getting things going again, it just depends on time available.\n\nThe biggest impact has been the decline of remote work as an option.  2 years ago we could all do our regular jobs while monitoring the bungie.net shutdown without any issue, so there was no problem moving quickly for that.\n\nThat's no longer an option for me, and I'm sure u/B1GSTACK and company are feeling it too unfortunately. ( Btw his team has been doing all the data processing, architecting, development, etc... I've mainly just done the PR for this project, and some development work, so we're in contact through this, but not related otherwise). \n\nSo we haven't forgotten, we do care, but external things have slowed several of us down, so we've just been trying to manage through all that.\n\n10/28/2022\n\nHi everyone, just wanted to share something I've been wokring on in the meantime while the stats project continues in development.  I made [halosnapshots.com](http://halosnapshots.com) so you can search your gamertag for any old snapshots from the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.  Some gamertags weren't scanned, mine included, but I hope this helps at least some of you!\n\nThe stats project is still in development.  Thanks for you patience!\n\n## Comment ID gmcbvg3 with +41 score by [(B1GSTACK, Reddit, 2021-02-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/l6jzpb/halobungienet_data_archive_almost_done_thank_you/gmcbvg3/) (in reply to ID l6jzpb):\n**Update (12/16/2023)** Website development is coming along again. The team has main jobs and daily life sadly this can't be a full time thing. But we are successfully pulling data and displaying summary data on page. (Maybe a teaser image soon) We have a ways to go yet for showing per game data and some other cool query data and abilities that we can do that bungie was never going to provide. But it will happen!\n\n**Update (3/28/2021)**\n\nAll games are in the database! As well as rank history and player summary. Sneak Peek below:\\* note images below are from when it was still running... the 1 table is indeed 10+ billion rows long... there is reasons for that and that is because every player in each game got its own row. This will allow for some amazing queries and interesting analytical data.  After games its just some rank history of each player.\n\n[data-sample-games](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/data-sample-00.PNG)\n\n[data-sample-games2](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/data-sample-01.PNG)\n\n\\*more to come soon. Working out some queries for some show and tell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update (3/18/2021)**\n\nData is still being imported. We just recently surpassed the 1 billion game mark so we are over half way! Probably \\~week left to finish. Here are a few images of some large numbers and I/O operations.\n\n[data\\_import\\_Tables01](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/data_import_progrsss_01.PNG)\n\n[data\\_import\\_Tables02](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/data_import_progrsss_02.PNG)\n\n[data\\_import\\_Tables03](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/data_import_progrsss_03.PNG)\n\n[data\\_import\\_Tables04](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/data_import_progrsss_04.PNG)\n\n[data\\_import\\_IO](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/data_import_progrsss_05.PNG)\n\n**Update (3/14/2021)**\n\nData is loading into a database as we speak. Been going in a few days now.  We are 40% of the way through. This is a TON of Data and Processing. But we are on pace. We have reached over 16,000 rows a second entered. Due to some structures we already have one table that's well over 6 billion rows and were over 700GB in size.  We are on NVMe for now 4TB hoping it all fits. I will say if any of the big storage vendors wish to have a \"sponsors by slot\"  we will gladly accept any part maker that wants to sponsor storage or ram we won't say no.\n\n**Update (2/22/2021)**\n\nI have posted up a sample of the data we have gathered so you can see what we are working with. Database design is in final review.  I have posted a zip for download. This is 1 file from each of our data folders.  [Halo - Data Sample.zip](http://cdn.halorepo.com/raw-data-samples/Halo-Bungie-Data-Sample.zip)\n\n**Update (2/9/2021) :**\\-  Its all over boys and girls!  ... We got everything we were hoping to get and then some.... Stay tuned for some updates... My team is going to get some rest and then start the hard part.\n\n**Update (2/8/2021) :**\\- Going good!  H2 cleanup is complete... That leaves a few items and some HeatMaps for GTs with most played games as well as some known players and big names.\n\n**Bungie** or a 343 employee that wants to arrange a data / file dump... I am ready willing and more than able store it. DM me.\n\n**Updates (2/6/2021):**\n\n*Questions / Comments / Contact us ---* ***Discord*** *-  bigstack*\n\n\\- We have completed all available game IDs of Halo 3. (some \\~1.9 Billion ish)\n\n\\- We have Completed Halo 3 Summary/Overview pages  for 22+ million Gamer tags ( page with medals and global stats like K/D games played etc)\n\n\\- We are 80% complete with the Rank history page of 22+ million Gamer Tags (the one that shows the date you achieved rank) ... This is expected to finish Sunday.\n\n\\- We are 85% done Halo 2 Games. This is expected Sunday with cleanup for any nulls games happening on last day Monday.\n\nThis has been a massive effort by a team of 3 people. Writing scripts , modifying, building status checks, checks to verify data, and re-pulling of data.  After the rate race is over with getting data, we will be working on creating a site where data is viewable and can be queried for some interesting stats and information that you wouldn't even find on the main site.  While this might not be the final home (we have other domains) information for now will be located at [halo.statrepo.com](https://halo.statrepo.com). (stay tuned)\n\n**Some interesting facts / images:**\n\n\\- Halo 3 Game data (game info + carnage report / score board  for \\~1.9b games comes to \\~1.9 TB of RAW JSON formatted data. Thus number is growing as I unpack the zips.\n\n\\- Halo 2 will come out to be a little shy of \\~1TB\n\n\\- After scanning all of Halo 3 games for GTs we came out to well over 22+ million unique GT's that played Halo 3 (final numbers will be available I'm spit balling with what I remember from a week + back)\n\n\\- Summary Data for H3 tags \\~ 700 GB raw JSON format\n\n\\- Over all servers in use to grab this data we were averaging \\~3 Gbps (when all servers were running with a full job set). This was \\~95% of the time and has been going since the announcement.\n\n\\- There are over 200 CPU cores running at pretty much \\~95+ % for the past \\~2.5 weeks.\n\n**----- More updates / info to come**\n\n**--- Let me know what you want to see or any questions you have.**\n\nSome images:\n\nH3 Game Info - [H3-games-sample.png](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/H3-games-sample.png)\n\nH3 GT Extract from Games - [GT-into-Database.PNG](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/GT-into-Database.PNG)\n\nH3 GT Summary - [gt-summary-sample](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/gt-summary-sample.PNG)\n\nH3 Rank History - [h3-rankhistory.PNG](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/h3-rankhistory.PNG)\n\nH2 Games - [h2-games.PNG](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/h2-games.PNG)\n\nServer CPU / Bandwidth (htop) - [server-stat-cpu-bandwidth.PNG](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/server-stat-cpu-bandwidth.PNG)\n\nStatus Checker (looks at total done per folder in tree) -> [status-checker.PNG](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/status-checker.PNG)\n\nServer Job Files - [h3-hist-files.PNG](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/h3-hist-files.PNG)\n\n### Comment ID gmpg2l1 with +7 score by [(greyfox19, Reddit, 2021-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/l6jzpb/halobungienet_data_archive_almost_done_thank_you/gmpg2l1/) (in reply to ID gmcbvg3):\nU legend <3 I got screenshots but it’s not the same.

A dialog will appear.\n\nClick “Confirm”. Under “Prime Gaming” “Active” will change to “Revoked”. This is how you unlink Bungie from Amazon.\n\nGo to https://gaming.amazon.com\n\nClick on the Destiny 2 reward you claimed.\n\nScroll down. After the “In-game instructions” you will see “Linked game account” over a box that says “Bungie account”, followed by your user name, followed by a “Manage” link.\n\nClick the “Manage” link. This takes you back to the Bungie site.\n\nIf it asks you to select your game platform for Destiny 2, do it and sign in with your user and password for that platform account. It will say “PRIME GAMING You are signed in as:” followed by your username.\n\nClick “Approve”. You will be returned to the Amazon Gaming site. This is how you re-link Bungie to Amazon.\n\nGo back to the Bungie Destiny 2 site.\n\nOpen your account menu again and click “Redeem Codes”\n\nClick “Partner Rewards”.\n(If you can’t find it, just go to https://www.bungie.net/rewardshistory)\n\nDepending on what the reward is, you might see an item in the list called “Prime Gaming Reward Offer” followed by a number. If you see a “Claim” button next to the listed item, click it.\n\nIf you get a message saying something like “Patience is a virtue. Wait a while before clicking this again.” that’s some kind of bug. Just reload the page.\n\nThe “Claim” button will be replaced with the original date you claimed the item on Amazon Gaming.\n\nRun Destiny 2 and check the Special Deliveries kiosk. I hope your reward items are there. If they are not, I’m sorry. This is what worked for me. If they are, you are soooo flippin’ welcome and I love you too!\n\n## Comment ID htuwl5d with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-01-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/rofek0/how_do_i_unlink_my_bungienet_account_from_my/htuwl5d/) (in reply to ID rofek0):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID ib357d4 with +1 score by [(tenoiii, Reddit, 2022-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/rofek0/how_do_i_unlink_my_bungienet_account_from_my/ib357d4/) (in reply to ID htuwl5d):\nDid you ever figure out a solution?

It’s hard to get it to load but it still does with time. Either way, the end of an era, a good memory. Time to wait for what lies ahead. No time like the present.\n\n*A sad edit 1: The archive.org site did not backup player profiles.\n\nEdit 2: this does NOT block access to your in-game fileshare. You can still boot up the 360 versions of halo reach and halo 3 and still locate those items still left in the fileshare. The game servers will go down permanently later at the very end of this year, by December 2021 all of OG halo 3 and all of OG halo reach will be gone. Save what you can and add it to your DVR storage then download it to your PC or external harddrive wherever you wish to keep your memories.\n\nEdit 3: the Wayback machine DOES WORK!! It will back up your player profiles! It’s just extremely difficult because of all the traffic.\n\nEdit 4: The website is dead. F in the chat, sad nostalgia type beat. You can still retrieve video clips and screenshots from your in-game fileshare, everything else should have been ported to MCC (back in 2019) if it was in your fileshare in terms of map variants and game types. I’d suggest recording the game clips and or screen shots to your DVR or external harddrive. Also, someone wanted to corrected date that the OG servers will be taken down so I added that to the above, it’s December 18-19th 2021 for those interested.\n\n#### Comment ID gmob74u with +160 score by [(JagmeetSingh2, Reddit, 2021-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/lftbm2/goodnight_halobungienet_well_see_you_starside/gmob74u/) (in reply to ID gmnx7os):\ndamn no player profiles backup\n\n#### Comment ID gmohpi0 with +16 score by [(GeminoFinancia, Reddit, 2021-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/lftbm2/goodnight_halobungienet_well_see_you_starside/gmohpi0/) (in reply to ID gmnx7os):\nThanks a lot for the second edit to your comment, I'll be sure to save what I can on my 360 to avoid a repeat of the emotional loss suffered tonight.\n\n#### Comment ID gmoucx6 with +4 score by [(keyboard-sexual, Reddit, 2021-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/lftbm2/goodnight_halobungienet_well_see_you_starside/gmoucx6/) (in reply to ID gmnx7os):\nLooks like the archive effort is still working.

Just your rank, how many games you played, first active, mp kills, total mp time, and whether or not you completed it on legendary.  That's all it has.\n\n### Comment ID gmoegyl with +12 score by [(Ithe_GuardiansI, Reddit, 2021-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/lftbm2/goodnight_halobungienet_well_see_you_starside/gmoegyl/) (in reply to ID gmnzop3):\nI lost track of the days and didn't realize it was already the 9th.

When I got the box, it was huge and I thought \"oh my God I CAN wear it!\" as I carried it to my car at a little after midnight. \n\nI had work at 7 the next day. I got home, called my girlfriend up at college, who all her friends that knew me were waiting for my call, and cheered. I was on the phone with them, giving a detailed play by play, and was sad I couldn't wear the helmet cause of the rectangle slot, and couldn't even modify it cause of the size. \n\nI played till about 6am, called out of work sick and played till about noon, when I started falling asleep. Took a couple hour nap, then played again from probably 3 or 4, till 11, and had to crash. Woke up early, played for an hour before I had to leave for work, came home for lunch to play, and did that for like a week. \n\nGood times.\n\n#### Comment ID gmo3ev9 with +22 score by [(Nchill7, Reddit, 2021-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/lftbm2/goodnight_halobungienet_well_see_you_starside/gmo3ev9/) (in reply to ID gmo1sqv):\nDuck hunt, smear the queer.

I recently went back and checked the stats from Halo 2 (when I first started playing Xbox Live) and it was such a wave of nostalgia.  Just being able to see the time I played my first match, the days I clearly skipped high school to play, my getting better as I played and started to actually win.  Looking at matches and seeing friends I had played games with and contacting them to reminisce.  I am so happy Bungie kept even those rudimentary stats around.  I've been through alot in life and stopped playing games for a while, and now I'm back on them again since my life has stabilized.  I really owe a lot of good times to Halo and bungie and I'm thankful that somewhere there is a record of those games from what were some of the best years of my life.  So far.  🙂\n\n## Comment ID gmqiepj with +6 score by [(3rudite, Reddit, 2021-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/lftbm2/goodnight_halobungienet_well_see_you_starside/gmqiepj/) (in reply to ID lftbm2):\nBungie always makes me cry with this shit\n\n### Comment ID gmqkdex with +2 score by [(SlidethedarksidE, Reddit, 2021-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/lftbm2/goodnight_halobungienet_well_see_you_starside/gmqkdex/) (in reply to ID gmqiepj):\nNo cap\n\n## Comment ID gmo1jby with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/lftbm2/goodnight_halobungienet_well_see_you_starside/gmo1jby/) (in reply to ID lftbm2):\nWell this is saddening.

Halo allowed them to get there.  Just like Marathon allowed them to get to where they were for Halo.  Just like Pathways into Darkness allowed them to get to where they were for Marathon.  The cycle continues.\n\nBungie is a totally different company than they were when they initially preserved this website.  They have gone through creating another huge and successful FPS franchise with another giant publisher and two support studios, to having to publish and foot the bill themselves.  I’m sure they would still reference Halo if they still owned it, but Microsoft owns it and it’s an ongoing, continuing franchise.  In fact, it’s their competition at this point.

Pulled out the win by 1 kill.\n\n## Comment ID gmo1yml with +3 score by [(Windsorthewiz, Reddit, 2021-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/lftbm2/goodnight_halobungienet_well_see_you_starside/gmo1yml/) (in reply to ID lftbm2):\nHow do you get to that Screen?\n\n### Comment ID gmo2196 with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/lftbm2/goodnight_halobungienet_well_see_you_starside/gmo2196/) (in reply to ID gmo1yml):\nClick on Halo Reach Stats\n\n## Comment ID gmo1zw5 with +3 score by [(hunter11726, Reddit, 2021-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/lftbm2/goodnight_halobungienet_well_see_you_starside/gmo1zw5/) (in reply to ID lftbm2):\nIt’s over ;(\n\n## Comment ID gmo2kxy with +3 score by [(Ares54, Reddit, 2021-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/lftbm2/goodnight_halobungienet_well_see_you_starside/gmo2kxy/) (in reply to ID lftbm2):\no7\n\n## Comment ID gmo3go1 with +3 score by [(DarthSangheili, Reddit, 2021-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/lftbm2/goodnight_halobungienet_well_see_you_starside/gmo3go1/) (in reply to ID lftbm2):\nMay the Great Journey await you, may your enemies writhe in hell, and your line continue forward, and gain honor.\nMay your scattered body go, beyond the limits of your mind...\nBeyond the limits of our worlds\nTo the places our ancestors dream and sang of\nAnd the Prophets speak of.\n\n## Comment ID gmo8hsj with +3 score by [(iShockLord, Reddit, 2021-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/lftbm2/goodnight_halobungienet_well_see_you_starside/gmo8hsj/) (in reply to ID lftbm2):\nNot a member here, what's happening?\n\n### Comment ID gmost2y with +6 score by [(Goldblum4ever69, Reddit, 2021-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/lftbm2/goodnight_halobungienet_well_see_you_starside/gmost2y/) (in reply to ID gmo8hsj):\nhalo.bungie.net was where players Bungie stored players’ photos, stats, etc. during their Halo days.

Halo 2 seemed like an interesting game to follow, so I researched it again. I decided to look at everyone from Bungie (and people who are listed as additional support. Even with the many, many, many names below, this is not everyone who worked on the game. Close to 50 additional people worked under Microsoft on everything from PR to testing, and this doesn’t even touch on the voice cast (except a few people who worked at Bungie and also supplied voices). \n\n I've decided to break this up into three different categories: still at Bungie, at 343 Industries or Microsoft, and elsewhere. All names in each category are sorted by names.\n\nNow, let's get started\n\n## At Bungie\n\n\nChristopher Barrett worked as one of the lead environmental artist. He is currently serves as game director at Bungie and last worked as the art director at Bungie. He recently founded Oryx Design Lab, which creates pixel art sprites for games.\n\nChris Butcher worked as an engineering lead for the game. Butcher continues to work in engineering and in 2014 became engineering director. Butcher joined the board of directors of Bungie in 2013.\n\nDavid Candland worked making the user interface for the game. Candland last worked as the UI lead for Destiny.\n\nFrank Capezzuto III worked as a single-player environmental artist. Capezzutto currently is a senior concept artist and 3D production artist at the company. Capezzutto also worked with Weta and Marvel on non-game Halo projects.\n\nSteve Cotton worked as multiplayer environment artist.

During E3 2013 preparations, Bungie was getting ready to demo the game for the first time before a huge audience at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), the biggest U.S. video game show. Activision was going to play the game music with a trailer, but shortly before E3, Activision took over the trailer work and supplied its own music, rather than the Music of the Spheres segments.\n\n> O’Donnell reacted angrily and believed Activision had overstepped its proper role by assuming artistic control of the trailer music. Ryan, the CEO of Bungie, and management shared his concern and filed a “veto” letter with Activision, which overruled the objection. During E3, O’Donnell tweeted that Activision, not Bungie, had composed the trailer music. He also threatened Bungie employees in an attempt to keep the trailer from being posted online and interrupted press briefings.\n\n**tldr** Marty o'donnell was/had control over the musical production rights of destiny, including the music used for promotional material. Activision began re-cutting the trailers and marty felt bungie wasn't doing enough to support him. \n\n**note** Some reports from the studio was that marty was over-focused on the music of destiny and wasn't doing enough to properly support other audio aspects like voice recording (that wizard came from the moon). He was more interested in working with Paul McCartney and creating the \"Music of Spheres\". After the incident he would remark publicly about his disenfranchisement, and his performance dropped off at work.\n\nThere were other comments about him kinda playing up his role too much and pulling away too much attention from other composers, musicians, and artists on the game. He was also very open about his political views and that got him into hot water from time to time (there were a couple twitter incidents).\n\n\nessentially, Marty was a polarizing figure at Bungie, the Activision fiasco was the straw that broke the camels back. Money was tied up in contracts which required settlement, bungie lost, paid out what was owed, and life goes on.\n\n### Comment ID dgne8bo with +18 score by [(Robertej92, Reddit, 2017-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/672n45/what_the_people_who_made_halo_2_are_up_to_now/dgne8bo/) (in reply to ID dgn5pj6):\nI'm not sure how big their team was at the time but I've got a feeling having a look at the team that made the original KOTOR could be interesting, I know a couple of them are the guys behind The Banner Saga and there's been a lot of departures in recent years so could be a fiar bit of variety there.\n\n#### Comment ID dgvrjh0 with +1 score by [(Forestl, Reddit, 2017-04-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/672n45/what_the_people_who_made_halo_2_are_up_to_now/dgvrjh0/) (in reply to ID dgne8bo):\nThe Banner Saga was made by former The Old Republic people, not KOTOR people. \n\nWith that said, I've looked up over 100 people who worked on KOTOR and am almost ready to start editing.

Marty had creative differences with the way Destiny was being handled. As many of us know, Destiny saw a complete change in what it was going to be in 2013 and dropped its story in favour of the game model it represents today (this is partly why Joe Staten left as he had been writing the story). It was massively inconvenient but something Marty could get around. Then the marketing team decided to use licensed songs instead of Marty's composed music, something no Bungie game had done since Marty had been at the company.\n\nI can't remember the exact details but either way it was like a snub on Marty's work. After that, they cancelled the release of his \"Music of the Spheres\" record which was supposed to release before Destiny. Marty was justifiably pissed and made his complaints known. Harold Ryan, the then CEO, had the Board of Directors come together to fire Marty without final pay. It was a sour note to end such a long partnership. Marty then sued Harold Ryan and Bungie for his final pay. He didn't do it out of spite but simply to receive what he was rightfully owed.\n\nNow as one of the founders of Highwire Games, he is in a much happier environment and has a prequel soundtrack coming out before the release of Highwire's first game which will have its own soundtrack.\n\n**TL;DR** Due to creative differences, a reworking of Destiny, and a less than ideal working relationship, Marty was fired without pay and sued the then-CEO and the company for his pay. He is doing much better now at the studio he helped found.\n\n### Comment ID dgnhoiv with +96 score by [(A_Manly_Soul, Reddit, 2017-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/672n45/what_the_people_who_made_halo_2_are_up_to_now/dgnhoiv/) (in reply to ID dgner8r):\nFiring Marty was really shitty of them.

It's been 10 years since I worked with Halo 2 as it was preparing to be launched. I was a QA worker on contract working in the secondary QA group at Microsoft. Each game had their own QA group, but sometimes the mundane and boring work was given to us. One example is listening to make sure the engine sounds for each Forza car was working properly and putting it in an excel sheet.\n\nOne of the best moments working there was that we were asked to help out in the Halo 2 LAN development. We had to leave our QA office and go to Bungie's office across the way to play in thier studio. (This was prior to Bungie having their own offices a few years later.)\n\nThey were very very very anal about LAN gaming as they had my team and other teams working on it for a few months. Those days we 8 guys would sit in a cramp room and play Halo 2 for a while as we tried to not to have too much fun. \n\nSometimes they'd fudge the ping to see how it affected gameplay, or would ask us all to do some sort of action like quit prior to the game starting or during. Usual  things that a player might expect. \n\nThe best moment was when we were testing out Headlong for that day as it had just been finished. That afternoon, half the team had to get out of their seats and entered in a few Bungie team members and we played 2 or 3 games with them. I think I only got 2 or 3 kills on Bungie, but they were ruthelessly unstopable and schooled us QA guys. I was just happy I had beat a few of the devs. \n\nAnyway, the game has been in my heart as one of the best games I tested while being at the job (Fable being #2) and was probably the best time in my life and Xbox's life. So many of the systems best games were being tested in that time. Makes me happy so many loved it as well after it's launch.\n\n### Comment ID dgz2m4c with +1 score by [(ybfelix, Reddit, 2017-05-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/672n45/what_the_people_who_made_halo_2_are_up_to_now/dgz2m4c/) (in reply to ID dgo5moe):\nSo if you don't mind what's with Xiamen?

      "# Post ID t0cjnx: I made a browser extension to claim earned rewards from any previous Season Pass on Bungie.net with +6157 score by [(ninth_reddit_account, Reddit, 2022-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/t0cjnx/i_made_a_browser_extension_to_claim_earned/)\n**Edit 10th June: Season pass rewards for seasons before Risen are not able to be obtained through the API**. That data just appears to have been deleted, with no way to obtain them. Rewards from seasons from Risen onwards are *currently* work through the extension, but each season has a higher chance at seasons becoming unavailable.\n\n---\n\nEdit: The extension has been pulled by Mozilla from the Firefox Addons site after being up there for over a year. I'm trying to get it back up, but hard to know when it'll be back** https://hachyderm.io/@joshhunt/110103218325074678 \n\nIt's a bit more effort, but you may be able to install this manually in your browser's dev mode https://github.com/joshhunt/season-pass-extension/#installing-a-release \n\n---\n\n\nI made a Destiny browser extension that lets you pull Season Pass rewards from *any* previous season directly on Bungie's website, as long as you earned them during that season. No need for Android, Bluestacks, or weird APKs!\n\nIt's called Season Pass Pass and it's available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/season-pass-pass/).\n\nInstall the extension, log into Bungie.net and use the pop up menu to override the \"Previous Season\" on Bungie.net to claim rewards you earned but forgot to claim from any previous season pass.\n\nRemember, once you’ve finished with it remember to uninstall/disable the extension in your browser settings. I tried to be as careful as possible, but you don’t want it interfering with Bungie’s site when it doesn’t need to :)\n\n**Edit:** I [just tried and verified this still works](https://twitter.com/joshhunt/status/1582380432892768257) as of 18/10/2022. This extension does not let you earn rewards (beyond the level 1 Exotic) from season's you have not played - you can only claim rewards you actually earned by did not claim.\n\nExact steps:\n\n - Use Firefox and install the Season Pass Pass extension. Don't try and bother around with the Chrome extension, it's just a bunch of hassle when the Firefox one works easier\n - Visit https://www.bungie.net and log in. Do not yet go to the Bungie season pass rewards page\n - Open Season Pass Pass extension menu (the little yellow ticket), click 'Change previous season', and select the season you wish to claim rewards from\n - Click the 'Previous Season' link in the extension to go to that season's season pass and you'll be able to claim any rewards you did not claim during that season.\n\n> **I get an error about missing permissions, or not playing Destiny 2**\n\nThis is probably because you have two accounts (e.g. Playstation and Steam) linked, and it's picking the wrong one. Either unlink the account you don't play, or activate cross save (which essentially disables it in the API anyway)\n\n> **Does this work on mobile/Opera GX/Internet Explorer/Samsung Smart Fridge?**\n\nI don't know, probably not. It's a Firefox extension that I tested in Firefox on Windows and Mac. If you can install Firefox extensions on your mobile device or Nintendo DS, see if it works and report back for others, but you're on your own!\n\n> **Can I claim rewards from seasons I haven't played?**\n\nProbably not, no. Some people have reported being able to claim the season pass exotic from level 1 from seasons they didn't play - I guess because that rank is just a gimme when you log in.\n\n## Comment ID hy8upum with +1251 score by [(ninth_reddit_account, Reddit, 2022-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/t0cjnx/i_made_a_browser_extension_to_claim_earned/hy8upum/) (in reply to ID t0cjnx):\nP.S. It's really funny that this works - the Bungie API allows items from any season pass to be pulled, but the apps and website only show the immediate previous season pass.\n\nI had loads of fun making this extension, but it would be great if Bungie just incorporated a season switcher directly into their site as a feature!\n\n### Comment ID hy9c0ah with +520 score by [(DarkSpiderMan21, Reddit, 2022-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/t0cjnx/i_made_a_browser_extension_to_claim_earned/hy9c0ah/) (in reply to ID hy8upum):\nOr the ability to just work on previous season passes in game.\n\n#### Comment ID hy9jixd with +88 score by [(KriptiKFate_Cosplay, Reddit, 2022-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/t0cjnx/i_made_a_browser_extension_to_claim_earned/hy9jixd/) (in reply to ID hy9c0ah):\nTo be clear, this is just allowing people to pull unclaimed but successfully earned rewards, yes?

Is anyone else experiencing this problem?\n\nNow when I go on \"Season Progress\", then click on \"previous season\", then activate 'Season Pass Pass', when I go to reload the page, the page is just blank. When I try and go to the current season page, it is also blank. \n\nWhen I reset the 'Season Pass Pass' so it is inactive, and then reload the season progress, the page is also blank. If I navigate back to [bungie.net](https://bungie.net) it works fine, and the other pages also work via [bungie.net](https://bungie.net) e.g. triumphs, collections and game history, however when I click to Season Progress I also get a blank screen.\n\nThis is occuring on both firefox and chrome and makes me suspect that Bungie have changed something behind the scenes. I am open to any suggestions.

I came back for Witch Queen.\n\nAt that time I bought the standard edition of Beyond Light, and the Deluxe Edition of Witch Queen, both for Xbox.\n\nAs expected, because I had the standard edition of BL for Xbox and didn't play at the time (to buy the seasons individually), I couldn't use this extension to claim the starting items from the past BL seasons.\n\nSo, I scared up a Steam key for the Beyond Light Deluxe Edition, and activated it on Steam. Logging in on Steam, I received some of the BL Deluxe entitlements (old pre-order items etc).\n\nAnd the cross-save page shows that I now have BL on the Steam side -- but it doesn't note any edition.\n\nI was hoping this would let me claim the pass level 1 items (i.e., exotics, class armor) from the missing seasons, as I should now have the past pass entitlement on my account, from having the BL Deluxe edition on the Steam side  — but no go.  I get the error \"You do not have permission to claim this reward. (1686)\". This is with the Steam account showing as active in the dropdown on the previous season page.\n\nThe issue is with the Seasons of the Hunt (Premium Class Rewards, Duality), Chosen (Premium Class Rewards, Ticcu's), Splicer (Cryothesia) and Lost (Lorentz Driver). I'm able to claim rewards (earned, or level one if unplayed) from all other seasons the extension accesses.\n\nAm I out of luck?

Basically it seems that bungie has randomly decided that my bungie account is now, after ten years of playing this game, under the age of 13. Because of this all chat and messaging connected to my account has been automatically locked. I can't even post on the bungie forums themselves for help.\n     So apparently the solution to this is to submit a \"data privacy request\" from help.bungie.net. The problem is that for some reason, i am completely unable to access this form in any way. The bungie help site will under no circumstances allow me to sign in. At every attempt to sign in the site begins to rapidly reload itself, almost as if i was constantly refreshing the page. It's done this up to 27 times in a row (i counted). \n     Now a lot of people have told me various solutions such as trying different browsers, clearing my cache/cookies and even other devices. I have tried this for days now, on chrome, edge, opera etc. I tried on my laptop, my phone, even on my PS5's internet. The same thing happens each time.\n     Now i heard Bungie had really poor customer service, but i am now realizing how poorly insufficient it really is. They have no number to call, no email to reach, nothing. I'm completely stuck and seemingly there is no way to reach anyone or anything that can help me.\n     At this point I'm just reaching out for something, anything, anyone who may possibly be able to help, reach someone at bungie as unrealistic as that probably is. I can no longer interact with the game as I need to be able. I can't even send a simple text message in the lfg app.\n     So if anybody reads this maybe just leave a random comment just so that this can get some traction or notice by someone who can help.

The information is correct because it allows me to sign into the regular bungie.net site, but the help.bungie site just kicks me and redirects me to the main bungie page every time.\n\n## Comment ID lsft1w0 with +1 score by [(notmasterrahool, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1g5no9x/i_am_in_an_impossible_situation_bungie_please_see/lsft1w0/) (in reply to ID 1g5no9x):\nThe game isn't worth playing, they've done you a favor...\n\n## Comment ID lsg1n7h with +1 score by [(Hribunos, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1g5no9x/i_am_in_an_impossible_situation_bungie_please_see/lsg1n7h/) (in reply to ID 1g5no9x):\nHad the same problem, had to download firefox to get their webform working after chrome/opera/edge/mobile failed.\n\n## Comment ID lshfbv8 with +1 score by [(TheChimeraKing, Reddit, 2024-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1g5no9x/i_am_in_an_impossible_situation_bungie_please_see/lshfbv8/) (in reply to ID 1g5no9x):\nIs there a way to check if this happened to my account? The other day I couldn’t get the fireteam voice chat to work and then later on I got one of those pop up bungie messages, I just x-ed out of it immediately out of habit but I saw it had said something about chat being disabled but it already wasn’t working for me so I didn’t think much of it. I haven’t tried using the chat since then as I don’t use it that often anyways but if it’s an issue with my account I’d like to know a way to check before it becomes an issue\n\n## Comment ID lsi3g68 with +1 score by [(Buckeye272727, Reddit, 2024-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1g5no9x/i_am_in_an_impossible_situation_bungie_please_see/lsi3g68/) (in reply to ID 1g5no9x):\nOn a side note bungie decided that my account name meloveulongtime wasn’t appropriate so I’m stuck with guardian now… no idea how to dispute that.\n\n## Comment ID lsip17i with +1 score by [(MedicallyHigh, Reddit, 2024-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1g5no9x/i_am_in_an_impossible_situation_bungie_please_see/lsip17i/) (in reply to ID 1g5no9x):\nSomeone with this amount of commitment to their character is exactly the type of people Bungie claims they’re trying to keep from quitting. I’m losing my mind just reading this post yet alone the amount of time this poor Guardian has gone through. They want their account to play a game that they have obvious commitments to. Why make it impossible for them to play they the way it’s designed? Bungie is slowly losing the trust and faith of so many Guardians it’s insane and I never thought I would be one of them. This game is on the brink of death, Bungie needs to smarten up ASAP, cause this BS isn’t fair. Simple as that. \n\nThis is the end of my PSA to fellow Guardians\nOne love to all of you.\n\n## Comment ID lsiwfgv with +1 score by [(jrgeek, Reddit, 2024-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1g5no9x/i_am_in_an_impossible_situation_bungie_please_see/lsiwfgv/) (in reply to ID 1g5no9x):\nBungie has customer support channels?

Now the most expensive bounties are at the top, which may trick new users into buying them. There is a bug where when you buy a daily repeatable bounty from Zavala that costs 3,000 Glimmer, Zavala will take the Glimmer but won't give you the bounty and you lose 3,000 Glimmer. This happens quite often, like several times a week. Please fix this bug.",

Many people, fostering a social network (\"climb the ladder\") over doing work, leaving a larger workload for others to complete. Many people refuse to give credit to where credit is due. Competition is so fierce that some in that environment would rather take credit for the things they did not do as opposed to give credit to where the credit is due. Just like any place, be sure to know who to avoid and who to chum up to. If you're a quiet one, be ready to do work and get minimal recognition.",

Low base pay vs. the rest of the industry (and they're vocally proud of it). Future bleak and incredibly uncertain. Entire company business plan shifts every few months. Very little time for iteration on projects you just have to do it right the first time or the threat of delays begins to come up. Very tight deadlines constantly and you'll work on several overlapping projects often. Some of the highest day to day stress I've ever felt at a game company",

For example, the internal website frontend for invoking a new build on our in-house build farm still uses Silverlight. You have to use IE compatibility mode in Edge to even load the page properly. And that doesn't even begin to comment on how inflexible and purpose-built the build farm itself actually is, providing almost no support for the rapid growth and expansion the studio has been experiencing. - Company culture is trending in the \"woke\" direction. For some this could be a pro, and in a lot of ways it is a pro, but if you ever disagree with a decision or an action that was taken in the name of \"diversity and inclusion\" then you better not share your opinion with anyone. You will be skewered by other employees and your name will be dragged through the mud behind your back. - Constantly understaffed while always biting off more than we can reasonably chew. Two week sprints literally feel like sprints from start to finish with no opportunity to rest, to evaluate where we are, or to take a look at the bigger picture. - Always focused on and optimizing for what needs to be immediately done, longer-term efforts are always deprioritized and even discouraged. - If you want to work in-person at the office, you need to live in or near Bellevue, WA which is comically expensive. - Recently bought out by Sony. Leadership super pinky swears that Bungie will retain almost all of its independence, and so far that feels like it's been true, but who's to say that will continue to be true if Bungie stumbles in the future? Sony bought Bungie to grow their own business, not as a good-will gesture. It doesn't matter what kind of protections were specified in the buyout details, get enough talented lawyers and you can make anything happen.",

Well, turns out for the last two years of review cycles (every six months) management has been told \"Oh, LAST cycle was actually the big promotion opportunity cycle, this one is just a check in.\" So most people who are brought in under-leveled, and underpaid for their discipline are stuck in a holding pattern with no way upwards unless you're friends with a guy in leadership and can get swapped around between different teams, or work yourself into a burnout oblivion. I have seen multiple cases of gender pay inequity and have heard second hand of multiple bad excuses from HR for why this happens. This was especially frustrating since Bungie constantly likes to remind the public how diverse friendly and supportive they are as a beacon in the industry for change. They have yet to put their money where their mouth is. Then the burnout culture. Deadlines, deadlines, and more deadlines that are always weeks behind, with lofty ideals from studio leadership that is far removed from the production realities. Most people feel like they can't even touch their PTO and get stuck working in terrible cycles until they're about to mentally break. Typically, they get no support from their team leads, and no action is taken to help these individuals work get reallocated to a healthy volume. This is compounded in studio meetings when leadership says \"just take your PTO!\" and their workers can see no reasonable end in sight. Ultimately, it's a boys club, and not one I'd recommend unless you're desperate.",

It typically is great to have junior artist entering the industry however, Bungie has opted to let senior talent go to reduce the overhead cost and that means things that would take a couple hours to do now take a couple days. Bungie is bleed industry leading talent because of their current pay structure. Before COVID they were very competitive with their salary but as time moves on they continue to fall further behind industry pay. As a Principal Artist I make 160,000 but friends I know who left Bungie are making 200,000 or more at smaller studios. Bungie is also loosing and having a hard time getting senior or higher level talent because they fully support geo based pay \"they keep saying this might change\" but as it stands if you don't live in downtown Bellevue or west side of WA you will take roughly a 20% decrease in pay. I was told my salary would go from 160,000 down to 120,000 it I moved roughly 30 miles away from the studio where homes are more affordable. The current employees that stayed at Bungie are currently doing the bare minimum to stay because each year they 1/4th of there big payout that comes from Sony. With that said employees that have only been at Bungie for 5 years have left because their payout is far less then they could make at a different studio. From my perspective several of the incubation projects at this point have been restructured and don't appear to be moving along smoothly and that's very unfortunate because some of them looked really fun.",

While some aspects have improved, such as reduced crunch, the studio seems to have lost a lot of appreciation for veteran talent. Out of necessity, Bungie needs to learn and hire a lot of the publication roles Activision provided, and studio leadership has definitely let the fox guard the hen house in this time because of it.\r\n\r\nAs a result, crunch has become a regular occurrence again, and burnout of the Destiny franchise is real. Many veterans are leaving to other studios formed by Bungie alumni or going elsewhere in the Seattle game dev scene. Those roles are not being backfilled, but rather replaced with a \"do more with less\" attitude, filling roles instead with contractors rather than full time talent we had been clicking on full cylinders with between the Taken King and Forsaken releases. \r\n\r\nThese factors have led to the poorest morale I've seen at the company, which has been declining since late 2018. Leadership says they understand, and will do better, but still keeps leaning into not backfilling jobs and waiting to align on a direction before it's too late to deliver. This has been most obvious on the Narrative and QA teams. Not seeing any improvement in sight, I sadly left the job I thought I would retire at.",

        "cons": "Things have changed quite a bit at Bungie since their split from Activision. I had been with the company since shortly after Halo Reach (almost a decade). While some aspects have improved, such as reduced crunch, the studio seems to have lost a lot of appreciation for veteran talent. Out of necessity, Bungie needs to learn and hire a lot of the publication roles Activision provided, and studio leadership has definitely let the fox guard the hen house in this time because of it.\r\n\r\nAs a result, crunch has become a regular occurrence again, and burnout of the Destiny franchise is real. Many veterans are leaving to other studios formed by Bungie alumni or going elsewhere in the Seattle game dev scene. Those roles are not being backfilled, but rather replaced with a \"do more with less\" attitude, filling roles instead with contractors rather than full time talent we had been clicking on full cylinders with between the Taken King and Forsaken releases. \r\n\r\nThese factors have led to the poorest morale I've seen at the company, which has been declining since late 2018. Leadership says they understand, and will do better, but still keeps leaning into not backfilling jobs and waiting to align on a direction before it's too late to deliver. This has been most obvious on the Narrative and QA teams. Not seeing any improvement in sight, I sadly left the job I thought I would retire at.",

        "cons": "Bungie continues to bleed talented individuals with years of knowledge and skills in favor of junior artist. It typically is great to have junior artist entering the industry however, Bungie has opted to let senior talent go to reduce the overhead cost and that means things that would take a couple hours to do now take a couple days. Bungie is bleed industry leading talent because of their current pay structure. Before COVID they were very competitive with their salary but as time moves on they continue to fall further behind industry pay. As a Principal Artist I make 160,000 but friends I know who left Bungie are making 200,000 or more at smaller studios. Bungie is also loosing and having a hard time getting senior or higher level talent because they fully support geo based pay \"they keep saying this might change\" but as it stands if you don't live in downtown Bellevue or west side of WA you will take roughly a 20% decrease in pay. I was told my salary would go from 160,000 down to 120,000 it I moved roughly 30 miles away from the studio where homes are more affordable. The current employees that stayed at Bungie are currently doing the bare minimum to stay because each year they 1/4th of there big payout that comes from Sony. With that said employees that have only been at Bungie for 5 years have left because their payout is far less then they could make at a different studio. From my perspective several of the incubation projects at this point have been restructured and don't appear to be moving along smoothly and that's very unfortunate because some of them looked really fun.",

And that doesn't even begin to comment on how inflexible and purpose-built the build farm itself actually is, providing almost no support for the rapid growth and expansion the studio has been experiencing. - Company culture is trending in the \"woke\" direction. For some this could be a pro, and in a lot of ways it is a pro, but if you ever disagree with a decision or an action that was taken in the name of \"diversity and inclusion\" then you better not share your opinion with anyone. You will be skewered by other employees and your name will be dragged through the mud behind your back. - Constantly understaffed while always biting off more than we can reasonably chew. Two week sprints literally feel like sprints from start to finish with no opportunity to rest, to evaluate where we are, or to take a look at the bigger picture. - Always focused on and optimizing for what needs to be immediately done, longer-term efforts are always deprioritized and even discouraged. - If you want to work in-person at the office, you need to live in or near Bellevue, WA which is comically expensive. - Recently bought out by Sony. Leadership super pinky swears that Bungie will retain almost all of its independence, and so far that feels like it's been true, but who's to say that will continue to be true if Bungie stumbles in the future? Sony bought Bungie to grow their own business, not as a good-will gesture.

Well, turns out for the last two years of review cycles (every six months) management has been told \"Oh, LAST cycle was actually the big promotion opportunity cycle, this one is just a check in.\" So most people who are brought in under-leveled, and underpaid for their discipline are stuck in a holding pattern with no way upwards unless you're friends with a guy in leadership and can get swapped around between different teams, or work yourself into a burnout oblivion. I have seen multiple cases of gender pay inequity and have heard second hand of multiple bad excuses from HR for why this happens. This was especially frustrating since Bungie constantly likes to remind the public how diverse friendly and supportive they are as a beacon in the industry for change. They have yet to put their money where their mouth is. Then the burnout culture. Deadlines, deadlines, and more deadlines that are always weeks behind, with lofty ideals from studio leadership that is far removed from the production realities. Most people feel like they can't even touch their PTO and get stuck working in terrible cycles until they're about to mentally break. Typically, they get no support from their team leads, and no action is taken to help these individuals work get reallocated to a healthy volume. This is compounded in studio meetings when leadership says \"just take your PTO!\" and their workers can see no reasonable end in sight. Ultimately, it's a boys club, and not one I'd recommend unless you're desperate.",

      "# [Wikipedia by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2001-08-02](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie)\nAmerican video game developer\n\nThis article is about the video game studio. For the type of elastic cord, see Bungee cord.\n\nBungie, Inc. is an American video game company based in Bellevue, Washington, and a subsidiary of Sony Interactive Entertainment. The company was established in May 1991 by Alex Seropian, who later brought in programmer Jason Jones after publishing Jones's game Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete. Originally based in Chicago, Illinois, the company concentrated on Macintosh games during its early years and created two successful video game franchises called Marathon and Myth. An offshoot studio, Bungie West, produced Oni, published in 2001 and owned by Take-Two Interactive, which held a 19.9% ownership stake at the time.[3][4]\n\nMicrosoft acquired Bungie in 2000, and its project Halo: Combat Evolved was repurposed as a launch title for Microsoft's Xbox console. Halo became the Xbox's \"killer app\", selling millions of copies and spawning the Halo franchise. On October 5, 2007, Bungie announced that it had split from Microsoft and become a privately held independent company, Bungie LLC, while Microsoft retained ownership of the Halo franchise intellectual property. It signed a ten-year publishing deal with Activision in April 2010.[5][6] Their first project was the 2014 first-person shooter, Destiny,[7] which was followed by Destiny 2 in 2017. In January 2019, Bungie announced it was ending this partnership, and would take over publishing for Destiny.[8][9]\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment completed its acquisition of Bungie in July 2022, with Bungie remaining a multi-platform studio and publisher.[10][11][12]\n\nAmong Bungie's side projects is Bungie.net, the company's website, which includes company information, forums, and statistics-tracking and integration with many of its games. Bungie.net serves as the platform from which Bungie sells company-related merchandise out of the Bungie Store and runs other projects, including Bungie Aerospace, a charitable organization called The Bungie Foundation, a podcast, and online publications about game topics.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBackground and founding (1990–1993)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the early 1990s, Alex Seropian was pursuing a mathematics degree at the University of Chicago, as the university did not offer undergraduate degrees in computer science.[13] Living at home shortly before graduation, his father's wishes for him to get a job convinced Seropian to start his own game company instead.[13]\n\nSeropian's first video game was a Pong clone, written and released nearly 20 years after the original, called Gnop! (Pong spelled backwards). The game was created in 1990, almost a year before Bungie's official incorporation,[14] but was released under the Bungie name and is considered by Bungie as its first game.[15][16] Seropian released Gnop! free of charge, but sold the source code for the game for US$15.[17] Gnop! was later included in several compilations of early Bungie games, including the Marathon Trilogy Box Set and the Mac Action Sack.\n\nSeropian officially founded Bungie Software Products Corporation in May 1991 to publish Operation: Desert Storm.[17][18] Seropian culled funding from friends and family, assembling the game boxes and writing the disks himself.[19] Operation: Desert Storm sold 2,500 copies, and Seropian looked for another game to publish.[17]\n\nSeropian met programmer Jason Jones in an artificial intelligence course at the University of Chicago.[17] Jones was a longtime programmer who was porting a game he wrote, called Minotaur, from an Apple II to the Macintosh platform.[20] Jones recalled, \"I didn't really know [Alex] in the class. I think he actually thought I was a dick because I had a fancy computer\".[17] Seropian and Jones partnered to release the role-playing video game as Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete in 1992; while Jones finished the coding, Seropian handled design and publicity.[20] The game relied on then-uncommon internet modems and AppleTalk connections for play and sold around 2,500 copies,[18] and developed a devoted following.[17] Both Seropian and Jones are considered co-founders of Bungie.[21][22]\n\nThe team focused on the Macintosh platform, not Windows-based personal computers, because the Mac market was more open and Jones had been raised on the platform. While Jones was responsible for many of the creative and technical aspects, Seropian was a businessman and marketer.[19] \"What I liked about [Seropian] was that he never wasted any money\", Jones recalled. With no money to hire other personnel, the two assembled Minotaur boxes by hand in Seropian's apartment.[17] While the pair remained low on funds—Seropian's wife was largely supporting him—the modest success of Minotaur gave the duo enough money to develop another project.[23]\n\nInspired by the shooter game Wolfenstein 3D, Jones wrote a 3D game engine for the Mac.[24] Bungie's next game was intended to be a 3D port of Minotaur, but Jones and Seropian found that Minotaur's top-down perspective gameplay did not translate well to the 3D perspective, and did not want to rely on modems.[20] Instead, they developed a new storyline for the first-person shooter that became Pathways into Darkness, released in 1993. Jones did the coding, with his friend Colin Brent creating the game's art.[25] The game was a critical and commercial success, winning awards including Inside Mac Games' \"Adventure Game of the Year\" and Macworld's \"Best Role-Playing Game\".[25]\n\nPathways beat sales expectations and became Bungie's first commercial success.[19][26] Bungie moved from a one-bedroom apartment to a studio in Chicago's South Side on South Halsted Street;[23] Seropian and Jones's first full-time employee, Doug Zartman, joined in May 1994 to provide support for Pathways, but became Bungie's public relations person, honing Bungie's often sophomoric sense of humor and irreverence.[27] Bungie composer Martin O'Donnell remembered that the studio's location, a former girls' school next to a crack house, \"smelled like a frat house after a really long weekend\" and reminded staff of a locale from the Silent Hill horror video games.[28]\n\nMarathon, Myth and Oni (1994–2001)\n\n[edit]\n\nBungie's next project began as a sequel to Pathways into Darkness, but evolved into a futuristic first-person shooter called Marathon. Pathways had taught Bungie the importance of story in a game,[29] and Marathon featured computer terminals where players could choose to learn more about the game's fiction.[30] The studio became what one employee termed \"your stereotypical vision of a small computer-game company—eating a lot of pizza, drinking a lot of Coke\" while the development team worked 14 hours every day for nearly six months.[27]\n\nAfter showing the game at the Macworld Expo, Bungie was mobbed with interest and orders for the game. The game was not finished until December 14, 1994; Jones and a few other employees spent a day at a warehouse assembling boxes so that some of the orders could be filled before Christmas.[27] The game was a critical and commercial success,[29] and is regarded as a relatively unknown but important part of gaming history.[31] It served as the Mac alternative to DOS PC-only games like Doom and System Shock.[19] The game's volume of orders was unprecedented for the studio, who found that its old method of mail or phone orders could not scale to the demand and hired another company to handle the tens of thousands of orders. Marathon also brought Bungie attention from press outside the small Mac gaming market.[27]\n\nThe first game's success led to a sequel, Marathon 2: Durandal. The series introduced several elements, including cooperative mode, which made their way to later Bungie games.[29] The game was released November 24, 1995, and outsold its predecessor. When Bungie announced its intention to port the game to the Windows 95 operating system, however, many Mac players felt betrayed, and Bungie received a flood of negative mail. Seropian saw the value of moving into new markets and partnering with larger supply chains, although he lamented the difficult terms and \"sucky\" contracts distributors provided.[27] The game released on Windows 95 in September 1996. Marathon Infinity was released the following year.\n\nAfter Marathon, Bungie moved away from first-person shooters to release a strategy game, Myth: The Fallen Lords. The game stressed tactical unit management as opposed to the resource gathering model of other combat strategy titles. The Myth games won several awards and spawned a large and active online community. Myth: The Fallen Lords was the first Bungie game to be released simultaneously for both Mac and Windows platforms.[19][32]\n\nThe success of Myth enabled Bungie to change Chicago offices and establish a San Jose, California based branch of the studio, Bungie West, in 1997.[19] Bungie West's first and only game would be Oni, an action title for the Mac, PC and PlayStation 2.[33]\n\nHalo and Microsoft acquisition (2001–2007)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1999, Bungie announced its next product, Halo: Combat Evolved, originally intended to be a third-person shooter game for Windows and Macintosh.[34] Halo's public unveiling occurred at the Macworld Expo 1999 keynote address by Apple's then-interim-CEO Steve Jobs (after a closed-door screening at E3 in 1999).[34]\n\nOn June 19, 2000, on the ninth anniversary of Bungie's founding, Microsoft announced that it had acquired Bungie and that Bungie would become a part of the Microsoft Game Division. Halo would be developed as an exclusive first-person shooter title for the Xbox. The reasons for Bungie accepting Microsoft's offer were varied. Jones stated that \"I don't remember the details exactly, it was all a blur. We'd been talking to people for years and years—before we even published Marathon, Activision made a serious offer. But the chance to work on Xbox—the chance to work with a company that took the games seriously. Before that we worried that we'd get bought by someone who just wanted Mac ports or didn't have a clue\".[35] Martin O'Donnell, who had joined Bungie as an employee ten days before the merger was announced, remembers that the stability of the Xbox as a development platform was not the only benefit.[28] Shortly before Myth II's release, it was discovered versions of the game could erase a player's hard drive; the glitch led to a massive recall of the games right before they shipped,[19][29] which cost Bungie nearly one million dollars.[19] O'Donnell stated in a Bungie podcast that this recall created some financial uncertainty, although accepting the offer was not something Bungie \"had to do\".[28] Seropian and Jones had refused to accept Microsoft's offer until the entire studio agreed to the buyout.[19]\n\nAs a result of the buyout, the rights to Myth and Oni were transferred to Take-Two Interactive (which at the time owned 19.9% of the studio) as part of the three-way deal between Microsoft, Bungie and Take-Two Interactive; most of the original Oni developers were able to continue working on Oni until its release in 2001.[36] Halo: Combat Evolved, meanwhile, went on to become a critically acclaimed hit, selling more than 6.5 million copies,[37] and becoming the Xbox's flagship franchise.[38]\n\nHalo's success led to Bungie creating three sequels. Halo 2 was released on November 9, 2004, making more than $125 million on release day and setting a record in the entertainment industry.[39] Halo 3 was released on September 25, 2007, and surpassed Halo 2's records, making $170 million in its first twenty-four hours of release.[40]\n\nBuyout and Destiny (2007–2022)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn October 1, 2007, Microsoft and Bungie announced that Bungie was splitting off from its parent and becoming a privately held limited liability company named Bungie, LLC.[41][42] As outlined in a deal between the two, Microsoft would retain a minority stake and continue to partner with Bungie on publishing and marketing both Halo and future projects, with the Halo intellectual property belonging to Microsoft.[43]\n\nWhile Bungie planned on revealing a new game at E3 2008, Bungie studio head Harold Ryan announced that the unveiling was canceled.[44] Almost three months later, Bungie announced that the new game was a prequel and expansion to Halo 3 titled Halo 3: Recon.[45] The next month, Bungie changed the game's title from Halo 3: Recon to Halo 3: ODST.[46] At E3 2009, Bungie and Microsoft revealed the company was developing another Halo-related game, Halo: Reach, for release in 2010.[47] Reach was the last game in the Halo franchise to be developed by Bungie.[48]\n\nBungie continued expanding, though it did not commit to details about new projects and ship dates.[49] The company grew from roughly 120 employees in May 2008[50] to 165 in June 2009, outgrowing the studio Microsoft developed. Ryan helped redesign a former multiplex movie theater in Bellevue into new Bungie offices, with 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) replacing the 41,000 square feet (3,800 m2) the company occupied previously.[51]\n\nIn April 2010, Bungie announced that it was entering into a 10-year publishing agreement with publisher Activision Blizzard.[52][53] Under Bungie's agreement with Activision, new intellectual property developed by Bungie will be owned by Bungie, not Activision, in a deal similar to the Electronic Arts Partners Program.[53][54]\n\nOn June 30, 2011, Bungie announced the \"Bungie Aerospace\" project; its slogan, \"Per audacia ad astra\", translates to \"Boldly to the stars\". The project is intended to provide independent game developers with publishing, resources, and support, including access to the Bungie.net platform.[55] In November 2011, Bungie Aerospace published its first game, Crimson: Steam Pirates, for iOS, developed by startup video game developer Harebrained Schemes.[56] In addition to publishing and distributing Crimson, Bungie Aerospace provided players with statistical support and a dedicated discussion forum on Bungie.net.[57]\n\nIn 2013, Bungie announced Destiny,[58] which launched for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One platforms on September 9, 2014.[59][60][61] During January 2016, Ryan stepped down as president and Pete Parsons, who had been the company's chief operating officer and executive producer since 2002, became its chief executive officer.[62]\n\nChinese video game conglomerate NetEase had invested $100 million into Bungie in 2018, in exchange for a minority stake in the company and a seat on the company's board of directors.[63]\n\nBungie terminated its publishing deal with Activision in 2019, after eight years; as per their agreement, Bungie retained all rights to Destiny and will self-publish future installments and expansions.[64][65][66] This included transitioning Destiny 2 from using Activision's Battle.net to Steam.[67] Bungie's communications director David Dague dispelled ideas that Activision was a \"prohibitive overlord\" that limited Bungie's creative control, and instead stated that both companies amicably split due to different ideas of where the Destiny franchise should head.[68]\n\nBungie announced a major expansion of its firm in February 2021. In addition to more than doubling its headquarters space in Bellevue, Washington, Bungie announced plans to open a new studio in Amsterdam by 2022. This would support additional staff not only for Destiny but additional media related to Destiny outside of video games, as well as a new intellectual property unrelated to Destiny that Bungie expects to release by 2025.[69][70]\n\nAcquisition by Sony Interactive Entertainment (2022–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 31, 2022, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced its intent to acquire Bungie for $3.6 billion. While Bungie would become part of the PlayStation family of studios it would remain an independent subsidiary under Sony in development and publishing and would not be part of PlayStation Studios. Instead, Sony's investment would help Bungie with hiring for developers to expand their work on the Destiny franchise and other planned games. Both companies stated that the deal would not affect platform availability or exclusivity for Destiny 2 but instead was geared towards media beyond video games that Bungie had been interested in pursuing for some time.[71] Bungie, in return, would help Sony enter the live service games market, as Sony had announced plans to launch at least ten such games by 2026 in an investors' presentation following the Bungie acquisition announcement.[72] Sony also said the Bungie acquisition will help Sony to become more multiplatform.[73]\n\nOf the $3.6 billion, Sony anticipated that at least $1.2 billion will be used as incentives for retention of Bungie's current employees.[74] In May, it was reported that the Federal Trade Commission was opening an inquiry into the acquisition, requesting more information about it a week prior. It was expected to delay the acquisition by at least six months.[75] The acquisition was closed by July 15, 2022, making Bungie a subsidiary under Sony Interactive Entertainment.[76][77][78]\n\nBungie laid off approximately 100 of 1200 employees on October 30, 2023, part of a larger cost-cutting measure across all Sony studios. According to Bloomberg News, revenue from Destiny 2 fell by 45% over the previous year due to waning popularity of the game, and work on the next major expansion The Final Shape was not progressing as well as expected. As part of these layoffs, The Final Shape was delayed from February 2024 to June 2024, while their next game, Marathon was pushed into 2025.[79][80]\n\nBungie had initiated legal action against AimJunkies, a group owned by Phoenix Digital that sold software that allowed for cheating in Destiny 2, in 2021, asserting copyright infringement, violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and trafficking in DMCA-violating software;[81] Bungie's initial claims were dismissed but an amended lawsuit allowed the case to proceed. AimJunkies attempted to countersue on claims that Bungie has hacked into the computer of the user that had developed these cheats, but those were dismissed in 2022.[82][83] At trial, judge Thomas Samuel Zilly ruled that Bungie lacked sufficient evidence to allow the DMCA and trafficking claims to move forward but instead sent these complaints to arbitration, where Bungie was awarded $4.3 million in damages.[84] The copyright claims proceeded to a jury trial, which found for Bungie in May 2024. While Bungie was only awarded around $63,000, the revenue made by the sale of the cheat programs by AimJunkies, the result was considered to be significant as it was the first time a jury trial ruled in game cheating software and could carry as case law in future lawsuits. AimJunkies asserted their plan to appeal both the arbitration and trial judgement.[85][86]\n\nBungie announced the layoffs of 220 staff in July 2024, leaving about 850 employees remaining.[2] Future plans including transitioning 155 more into Sony directly. Parsons stated that they had to make this decision \"after exhausting all other mitigation options\", and that these layoffs would allow them \"to refocus our studio and our business with more realistic goals and viable Financials\", with focus on Destiny and Marathon going forward. Additionally, one of the unannounced games in a new IP that Bungie was developing will be transitioned to a new studio under PlayStation Studios.[87] According to journalist Jason Schreier in speaking with those at Bungie, the two rounds of layoffs had resulted from Bungie trying to explore too many new projects too quickly shortly after the Sony acquisition, hiring several new staff and drawing off Destiny developers to pursue these projects, with the expectation from management that they would be able to pull through with \"Bungie magic\" that the studio had been known for.[88] The following October, the Creative Studios arm of Bungie was moved and integrated into PlayStation Studios to help support other Sony live service games, though they would also continue to support Destiny and Marathon.[89]\n\nBungie had 1,600 employees prior to the first round of layoffs in October 2023, according to former chief legal officer Don McGowan. This indicates that the company has lost over 750 employees in less than a year.[90] Also, several teams at Bungie has transitioned over to Sony PlayStation as part of Bungie's integration into Sony.[91] After a second round of layoffs in July 2024, several high-ranking executives seem to have departed, including Chief Creative Officer Jonny Ebbert and Chief Strategy Officer Ondraus Jenkins.[92]\n\nBungie.net\n\n[edit]\n\nBungie.net serves as the main portal for interaction between company staff and the community surrounding Bungie's games. When Bungie was bought by Microsoft, the site was seen as in competition with Microsoft's own Xbox.com site, but community management eventually won out as the bigger concern.[93] The site has been redesigned several times.[94]\n\nDuring Bungie's involvement with the Halo franchise, the site recorded statistics for each game played.[95] This information included statistics on each player in the game,[95] and a map of the game level showing where kills occurred, called \"heatmaps\".[96] On January 31, 2012, Bungie announced that, as of March 31, 2012, Bungie.net would no longer update Halo game statistics and Halo player service records, host new user-generated Halo content, or operate Halo's \"Bungie Pro\" service. Bungie's cessation of these services on March 31 completed the transition process of all data for Halo games being managed by 343 Industries.[97] Bungie.net records player's statistics for their game franchise Destiny. In addition to the collection of data and the management of Destiny player's accounts, the website serves as a form of communication between Bungie and the community.\n\nWhile Bungie had long provided places for fans to congregate and talk about games, as well as releasing new information and screenshots over Bungie.net, it historically had made less effort and been less successful at providing access to the inside workings of Bungie and its staff. As part of a move to become more familiar with fans, Bungie recruited recognized and respected voices from the fan community, including writers Luke Smith, Eric Osborne, and others.\n\nBungie also has an iOS and Google Play application that allows provides news, inventory management, and group finding for their game Destiny on the go.[98]\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nMartin O'Donnell described Bungie's workplace culture as \"a slightly irreverent attitude, and not corporate, bureaucratic or business-focused\";[99] artist Shi Kai Wang noted that when he walked into Bungie for an interview, \"I realized that I was the one who was over-dressed, [and] I knew this was the place I wanted to work\".[100] Bungie's content manager and podcast host, Frank O'Connor, comically noted that at a GameStop conference, the Bungie team was told to wear business casual, to which O'Connor replied \"We [Bungie] don't do business casual\".[95]\n\nThis informal, creative culture was one of the reasons Microsoft was interested in acquiring Bungie,[101] although game designer Jordan Weisman said that Microsoft came close to destroying the company's development culture, as it had with the now-defunct FASA Studio.[102] Studio head Harold Ryan emphasized that even when Bungie was bought by Microsoft, the team was still independent:\n\nOne of the first things [Microsoft] tried after acquiring Bungie, after first attempting to fully assimilate them, was to move Bungie into a standard Microsoft building with the rest of the game group. But unlike the rest of the teams they'd brought in previously, Bungie didn't move into Microsoft corporate offices – we tore all of the walls out of that section of the building and sat in a big open environment. Luckily Alex and Jason [Seropian and Jones, Bungie's founders] were pretty steadfast at the time about staying somewhat separate and isolated.[99]\n\nIn 2007, Microsoft eventually moved the studio to Kirkland, Washington, where it reincorporated as Bungie, Inc.[99] Despite the move, financial analyst Roger Ehrenberg declared the Bungie-Microsoft marriage \"doomed to fail\" due to these fundamental differences.[103] Bungie also pointed out that it was tired of new intellectual property being cast aside to work on the Halo franchise.[99] Edge described the typical Bungie employee as \"simultaneously irreverent and passionately loyal; fiercely self-critical; full of excitement at the company's achievements, no matter how obscure; [and] recruited from its devoted fanbase\".[93]\n\nThe Bungie workplace is highly informal, with new and old staff willing to challenge each other on topics, such as fundamental game elements. Staff are able to publicly criticize their own games and each other.[93][104] Fostering studio cooperation and competition, Bungie holds events such as the \"Bungie Pentathlon\", in which staff square off in teams playing games such as Halo, Pictionary, Dance Dance Revolution, and Rock Band.[104] Bungie also faced off against professional eSports teams and other game studios in Halo during \"Humpdays\", with the results of the multiplayer matches being posted on Bungie.net.[105]\n\nBungie's staff and fans, known as the \"Seventh Column\", have banded together for charity and other causes. After Hurricane Katrina, Bungie was one of several game companies to announce its intention to help those affected by the hurricane, with Bungie donating the proceeds of special T-shirts to the American Red Cross;[106][107][108] after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Bungie sold \"Be a Hero\" T-shirts and donated money to the Red Cross for every Halo 3 or ODST player on Xbox Live who wore a special heart-shaped emblem.[109] Other charity work Bungie has done included auctioning off a painting of \"Mister Chief\" by O'Connor,[110] a Halo 2 soda machine from Bungie's offices,[111] and collaborating with Child's Play auctions.[112] In 2011, Bungie formed a nonprofit organization, named Bungie Foundation.[113]\n\nIn December 2021, IGN reported from interviews with 26 former and current employees that there had been past and some current issues with a male-dominated work culture and crunch time that was discriminatory towards female employees since around 2011, but the company more recently had been working to improve these issues, previously parting ways with the majority of people mentioned in the article. Parsons wrote a response about Bungie's commitment to improve the workplace culture, which had aligned with statements from more recent employees that had spoken to IGN. Parsons apologized to any employee who \"ever experienced anything less than a safe, fair, and professional working environment at Bungie\", and stated of several efforts that the company was making to eliminate any type of \"rockstar\" attitude that may exist at the studio.[114]\n\nGames developed\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Platform 1990 Gnop!

Double Aught was a short-lived company composed of several former Bungie team members, founded by Greg Kirkpatrick. Seropian left to form Wideload Games, developer of Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse, and later co-founded Industrial Toys. Other companies include Giant Bite, founded by Hamilton Chu (producer on Halo and Oni) and Michael Evans (project lead on Oni),[116] and Certain Affinity, founded by Max Hoberman (the multiplayer design lead for Halo 2 and Halo 3). Certain Affinity's team included former Bungie employees David Bowman and Chad Armstrong (who later returned to Bungie). The studio collaborated with Bungie in releasing the last two downloadable maps for Halo 2[117] and the downloadable Defiant Map Pack for Halo: Reach.[118] 343 Industries, a game studio formed by Microsoft to manage the Halo series following the launch of Halo: Reach, also includes a few former Bungie employees, including Frank O'Connor.[119] In 2015, long-time Bungie employee Martin O'Donnell started a new game studio known as Highwire Games.[120] In 2016, former Bungie CEO and studio head Harold Ryan founded a new game studio known as ProbablyMonsters.[121]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",

      "# [How Can Bungie Sustain Both ‘Destiny 2’ And ‘Marathon’ Going Forward? by Paul Tassi on 2024-03-27](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/03/27/how-can-bungie-sustain-both-destiny-2-and-marathon-going-forward/)\nThe closer we get to The Final Shape, the more my opinions about the future of Bungie are starting to shift. I originally said that I was sure that Destiny 2 would continue making major expansions, not just the episodic season replacements that have already been announced, but now I’m becoming less and less sure.\n\nWhy? Because new findings seem to suggest things may be about to get a lot worse before (if) it gets better. A recent IGN report talked about how there is a tremendous weight on The Final Shape to perform, I would argue too much, given low preorders and player disillusionment over the past year. And if that is not the case, the threat of further layoffs looms. Over a hundred people were cut from Bungie in the fall of last year, and while we don’t know how deep cuts may go a second time, I am sorry to say that I have to imagine there may not be any avoiding further ones after The Final Shape. At least from the perspective of the (much-derided) Bungie leadership who decided to fire people the first time.\n\nBut my question is that with all these layoffs, how can Bungie possibly hope to sustain both Destiny 2 going forward, or even Destiny as an overall franchise, alongside the launch of Marathon, a big new shooter that is gambling a huge amount of the company’s fortunes on its success? That’s to say nothing of other projects that are still in incubation, albeit recent reports say ones like the codenamed “Gummy Bears” have been put on pause for now due to the issues at hand.\n\nThe situation seems at least somewhat similar to a company like Riot Games, which still manages longtime hit League of Legends, but also its shooter Valorant, plus smaller projects like Teamfight Tactics. If they can do it, can’t Bungie?\n\nRiot has its own share of culture problems, so it is certainly not exempt from those Bungie-like struggles, plus recent layoffs that included 11% of the company, 500 jobs. But that’s the thing, 11% of Riot being 500 jobs means that the company is now around 4,500 employees. That is over four times the size of Bungie, which is now down closer to 1,000 employees after layoffs, and could be even smaller if further ones happen.\n\nAnd while this is a bit apples and oranges, I would argue that managing a game like Destiny 2 is more “work” in some sense than League of Legends doing balance passes and pumping out individual new champions. Bungie has been cranking out huge expansions and increasingly large seasonal content over the last few years, alongside trying to also do “free” things like eternally balancing PvP, and now stopgap Into the Light content. It’s a massive amount of work at high cost.\n\nThe answer, unfortunately, may be that leadership simply doesn’t care how Bungie manages after the next year or two. The IGN report said leadership will likely leave in “droves” after their final payouts from the Sony deal come through in 2026, and it would be someone else’s problem after that as to how games like Destiny and Marathon are supported from there.\n\nMy main question for both these projects is scope. If the report is that Marathon is now a hero-based extraction shooter, how many of those arrive at launch (Valorant had 12, Overwatch had 21)? Then you get in a situation where, because this is now a hero game, you have to constantly add new characters, perhaps one a season, as no doubt Marathon will have seasons. That wouldn’t have been the case with custom characters.\n\nDestiny feels like it almost has to shrink. Episodes may be larger than seasons, but I would still be surprised if three Episodes had as much total content as four seasons. And the question of expansions remains. On the one hand as the game’s biggest revenue drivers, you wonder how they could afford to lose them, on the other, are making those every 1.5 years sustainable at the same scale? I’m just not sure how that’s possible given all the other considerations here.\n\nA main point is I really, really don’t think there should be more layoffs no matter what happens with The Final Shape as that would only damage the company’s future prospects even further with fewer people doing more work across two games now. But who knows what Bungie leadership is thinking these days. It mostly seems to be about themselves.\n\nFollow me on Twitter, Threads, YouTube, and Instagram.",

      "# [Bungie announces \"major changes\" for Destiny 2, two \"medium\" expansions coming a year by Matt Wales on 2024-09-09](https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-announces-major-changes-for-destiny-2-two-medium-expansions-coming-a-year)\nA month after Bungie acknowledged player \"uncertainty surrounding the future of Destiny\" following mass layoffs at the studio, the developer has announced \"major changes for the future\" of its live-service shooter, which will now receive multiple paid expansions a year.\n\nMore specifically, Destiny 2's overhauled release model, announced to coincide with the series' tenth anniversary, will see two \"medium-sized\" paid expansions release annually, alongside four \"major\" free content updates. All this will form a \"new multi-year saga\" (the first since Destiny 2's Light and Darkness saga concluded with its The Final Shape expansion earlier this year) promising new characters, factions, twists, and more.\n\nThings kick off next summer with Destiny 2's first new expansion, Codename: Apollo, described as a \"non-linear character-driven adventure\". Elaborating on Bungie's new \"non-linear\" direction in a blog post accompanying today's news, game director Tyson Green explained the studio believes Destiny 2 has become \"too rigid\", and that its annual expansions \"have started to feel too formulaic and are over too quickly with little replay value\".\n\nAs such, Bungie is currently exploring non-linear campaigns \"similar to the Dreaming City or Metroidvanias, and even more unusual formats like roguelikes or survival shooters\". Green says Destiny 2's new expansion plans give the team a \"new opportunity to try something different\", although he insists, \"departing from one-shot campaigns doesn't mean we are turning away from great story telling\".\n\nStarting with Codename: Apollo, each new Destiny 2 expansion will mark the start of a new season, arriving alongside a \"major\" free Episode update for all players. A second Episode will arrive three months later as part of the current season before everything changes with the next expansion's release.\n\nEach Episode will \"refresh the core game with new and reprised content\", introducing new activities (such as Strikes, Exotic missions, or new modes like Onslaught), new rewards, weekly events, features, and combat meta and balance changes. Green teases players can expect an overhauled activity UI as part of plans to improve approachability, as well as a \"greatly improved\" Challenge Customisation system, and new rewards including higher tiers of legendary gear. More will be shared in developer Deep Dives due in the \"coming months.\"\n\nIn a second blog post focusing on Destiny's 10th anniversary celebrations, Bungie unveiled a new set of Destiny 2 armour for each class inspired by the series' original concept art, plus new challenges, starting today, offering the Legend title and seal as rewards. Additionally, Cayde 6's Hand Cannon is being turned into a real-life Nerf gun, for fans of high-speed sponge violence.\n\nToday's news - the second revised release model Bungie has announced for Destiny 2 in less than three months - follows assurances to players back in August that despite \"recent changes\", the studio remained \"committed to Destiny, to supporting our community with transparency, and to delivering regular updates about the game.\" Those \"changes\" were, of course, an allusion to the sweeping layoffs that saw 220 Bungie staff lose their jobs back in July, just nine months after 100 employees were laid off at the studio.\n\nGameFile journalist Stephen Totilo later reported July's layoffs had long been planned, and \"couldn't be avoided\" even if this year's Final Shape expansion had seen \"blockbuster performance\". Bungie management was said to have concluded last year - amid poor sales and a dwindling Destiny 2 player base - it would need to \"make deep cuts to show Sony's executives that it was taking its finances seriously\", with the studio's autonomy - and management jobs - seemingly on the line if it failed to meet its targets. July's layoffs were met with calls for Bungie CEO Pete Parsons to resign."

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on Bungie, Inc. and Its Products\n\n## Company Overview\n\nBungie, Inc. is an American video game developer based in Bellevue, Washington, and is a subsidiary of Sony Interactive Entertainment. Founded in May 1991 by Alex Seropian and Jason Jones, Bungie initially focused on Macintosh games and gained recognition with franchises like *Marathon* and *Myth* [(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie). The company was acquired by Microsoft in 2000, which led to the development of the *Halo* franchise, a significant success for the Xbox console. Bungie became an independent company again in 2007 but retained a partnership with Microsoft for the *Halo* series [(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\nIn 2010, Bungie signed a ten-year publishing deal with Activision, which ended in 2019, allowing Bungie to self-publish its *Destiny* franchise. In January 2022, Sony announced its acquisition of Bungie for $3.6 billion, with the intention of expanding Bungie's capabilities while maintaining its independence as a multi-platform studio [(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n## Company Scale and Recent Changes\n\nAs of October 2023, Bungie had approximately 1,600 employees. However, the company has undergone significant layoffs, with around 100 employees laid off in October 2023 and an additional 220 in July 2024, reducing the workforce to about 850 [(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie). These layoffs were part of a broader cost-cutting measure across Sony studios, attributed to a 45% decline in revenue from *Destiny 2* and challenges in developing the next major expansion, *The Final Shape* [(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n## Product Overview: Destiny Franchise\n\nBungie's flagship product, *Destiny*, launched in 2014, followed by *Destiny 2* in 2017. The franchise has been characterized by its live-service model, which includes regular expansions and seasonal content. However, recent reports indicate that player engagement has waned, leading to concerns about the sustainability of the franchise [(Forbes, 2024-03-27)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/03/27/how-can-bungie-sustain-both-destiny-2-and-marathon-going-forward/).\n\nIn September 2024, Bungie announced a new release model for *Destiny 2*, which will now feature two medium-sized paid expansions annually, alongside four major free content updates. This shift aims to address player feedback regarding the game's structure and replayability [(Eurogamer, 2024-09-09)](https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-announces-major-changes-for-destiny-2-two-medium-expansions-coming-a-year).\n\n## Executive Leadership\n\nPete Parsons, who became CEO in January 2016, has been at the helm during significant transitions, including the acquisition by Sony and the restructuring of the company. Following the layoffs, Parsons stated that the decisions were made \"after exhausting all other mitigation options\" and aimed to refocus the studio's goals [(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n## Partnerships and Acquisitions\n\nBungie's acquisition by Sony Interactive Entertainment in July 2022 was a strategic move to bolster Sony's presence in the live-service game market. The deal was expected to help Bungie expand its development team and explore new media opportunities beyond video games [(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie). Additionally, Bungie had previously partnered with Chinese conglomerate NetEase, which invested $100 million in 2018 for a minority stake [(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n## Opinions and Community Feedback\n\nCommunity sentiment around Bungie has been mixed, particularly following the layoffs and the perceived decline in *Destiny 2*'s popularity. Reports suggest that the leadership's decisions have led to dissatisfaction among employees and players alike, with calls for accountability from Bungie's management [(Forbes, 2024-03-27)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/03/27/how-can-bungie-sustain-both-destiny-2-and-marathon-going-forward/). The company's informal and creative workplace culture has been noted as a strength, but recent allegations of a male-dominated environment and issues with crunch time have raised concerns about its internal dynamics [(Wikipedia, 2001-08-02)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n## Future Developments\n\nBungie is currently working on *Marathon*, a new title expected to launch in 2025, alongside ongoing support for *Destiny 2*. However, the company faces challenges in balancing resources between these two major projects, especially in light of recent layoffs and financial pressures [(Forbes, 2024-03-27)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/03/27/how-can-bungie-sustain-both-destiny-2-and-marathon-going-forward/). The success of *The Final Shape* expansion is critical for the franchise's future, as it is seen as a pivotal moment for Bungie to regain player trust and engagement [(Forbes, 2024-03-27)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/03/27/how-can-bungie-sustain-both-destiny-2-and-marathon-going-forward/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBungie, Inc. has a storied history in the gaming industry, marked by significant successes and challenges. As it navigates the complexities of its recent acquisition by Sony and the evolving landscape of live-service games, the company's ability to adapt and innovate will be crucial for its future success. Prospective candidates and investors should closely monitor Bungie's strategic decisions and community engagement as indicators of its long-term viability."
