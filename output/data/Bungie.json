  "summary_markdown": "# About Bungie\n\nBungie, Inc. is a prominent American video game developer headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. The company was founded in May 1991 by Alex Seropian and Jason Jones. Initially, Bungie focused on developing games for the Macintosh platform, gaining early recognition with franchises like *Marathon* and *Myth*. The company became widely known for creating the *Halo* franchise after being acquired by Microsoft in 2000. Bungie regained its independence in 2007 and launched the *Destiny* franchise in 2014. In January 2022, Bungie was acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment for $3.6 billion, although it continues to operate independently in terms of development and publishing [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\nBungie is primarily known for its flagship game series, *Destiny 2*, an online multiplayer first-person shooter that incorporates elements of role-playing games and MMOs. The game has been expanded through multiple expansions, including *Forsaken*, *Shadowkeep*, *Beyond Light*, *The Witch Queen*, and *Lightfall*. Bungie also engages in community management and support through platforms like [Bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/), where players can manage clans, access game-related content, and participate in community events.\n\nBungie's customer base consists of a diverse group of gamers who enjoy immersive multiplayer experiences. The company has built a strong community around its games, fostering engagement through events, forums, and social media. Bungie promotes a culture of diversity and inclusion, emphasizing equal opportunity in hiring practices and valuing the unique perspectives and experiences of its workforce.\n\nAs of October 2023, Bungie had approximately 1,600 employees, but significant layoffs have reduced the workforce to about 850 by July 2024 [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie). The company has faced financial challenges, including a reported 45% drop in revenue from *Destiny 2* in 2023, prompting layoffs and delays in upcoming content [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Pete Parsons**: CEO of Bungie since January 2016. Parsons has played a crucial role in guiding the company through its transition to independence and its acquisition by Sony. He has emphasized the importance of setting realistic goals and maintaining financial viability, especially in light of recent layoffs [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n- **Celia Hodent**: Known for her expertise in user experience (UX) and cognitive science in game design, Hodent has contributed to shaping UX strategies at Bungie. She is also the founder of the Game UX Summit, which focuses on enhancing user experience in video games [(Bungie.net, 2025)](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/264682259?sort=0&page=0).\n\n# News\n\n## Acquisitions and Partnerships\n\n- **Sony Acquisition**: On January 31, 2022, Sony announced its acquisition of Bungie for $3.6 billion. This move was intended to strengthen Sony's presence in the live service games market, with Bungie expected to assist in developing multiple live service titles by 2026 [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n- **NetEase Investment**: In 2018, NetEase, a Chinese video game conglomerate, invested $100 million in Bungie, acquiring a minority stake and a board seat [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n## Product Developments\n\n- **Destiny 2: The Final Shape**: Released in June 2024, this expansion concluded a decade-long narrative arc within the Destiny universe. It received mixed reviews, with some players expressing dissatisfaction over the narrative's resolution, particularly regarding the reliance on raid content for a complete story experience [(Gizmodo, 2024)](https://gizmodo.com/destiny-2-final-shape-ending-codename-frontiers-bungie-1851530114).\n\n- **Future Content**: Bungie has announced plans for three new episodes in *Destiny 2*, focusing on classic antagonistic factions and revisiting previously vaulted locations [(Gizmodo, 2024)](https://gizmodo.com/destiny-2-final-shape-ending-codename-frontiers-bungie-1851530114).\n\n## Challenges and Legal Actions\n\n- **Financial Challenges**: Bungie has faced significant financial challenges, including a 45% drop in revenue from *Destiny 2* in 2023, leading to layoffs and delays in content releases [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n- **Legal Disputes**: Bungie has been involved in legal actions against AimJunkies, a group selling cheating software for *Destiny 2*. The case has seen mixed outcomes, with Bungie awarded damages in arbitration but facing challenges in proving copyright claims in court [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n## Recent News Highlights\n\n- **Server Outage and Character Rollback**: A small team dedicated to player retention led to a 20-hour server outage and character rollback in *Destiny 2* [(Phil Savage, 2025-03-21)](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/we-made-one-big-mistake-destiny-2-developer-reveals-how-a-small-team-dedicated-to-player-retention-led-to-a-20-hour-server-outage-and-character-rollback/).\n\n- **Rite of the Nine Event**: Bungie mistakenly rolled out the *Destiny 2* Rite of the Nine event three weeks early, with new loot already dropping [(Andy Chalk, 2025-03-11)](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/oops-bungie-rolled-out-destiny-2s-rite-of-the-nine-event-three-weeks-early-and-new-loot-is-already-dropping/).\n\n- **Marathon Preorder Bonuses**: Preorder bonuses for Bungie's upcoming game, *Marathon*, appear to have leaked on Steam [(Claire Lewis, 2025-03-05)](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-preorder-bonuses-appear-to-have-leaked-on-steam/1100-6529918/).\n\nBungie continues to be a significant player in the video game industry, particularly with its flagship product, *Destiny 2*. However, the company faces challenges related to financial performance, employee retention, and community satisfaction. The recent acquisition by Sony presents opportunities for growth and expansion, particularly in the live service market, but also necessitates careful management of resources and expectations moving forward.",

      "# Post ID 672n45: What the people who made Halo 2 are up to now with +4334 score by [(Forestl, Reddit, 2017-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/672n45/what_the_people_who_made_halo_2_are_up_to_now/)\nOh god, this took a while to put together.\n\nThe top recommendation from [GTA 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/637dft/what_the_people_who_made_grand_theft_auto_3_are/) thread was Halo 2/3 or Shadowrun (2007) from /u/Armonster. Halo 2 seemed like an interesting game to follow, so I researched it again. I decided to look at everyone from Bungie (and people who are listed as additional support. Even with the many, many, many names below, this is not everyone who worked on the game. Close to 50 additional people worked under Microsoft on everything from PR to testing, and this doesn’t even touch on the voice cast (except a few people who worked at Bungie and also supplied voices). \n\n I've decided to break this up into three different categories: still at Bungie, at 343 Industries or Microsoft, and elsewhere. All names in each category are sorted by names.\n\nNow, let's get started\n\n## At Bungie\n\n\nChristopher Barrett worked as one of the lead environmental artist.

Scott last worked as the visual FX art lead for Destiny. In 2016 he left Bungie and currently works at HBO as a senior design engineer. \n\nStefan Sinclair worked as one of the engineers for the game. In 2008 Sinclair left Bungie to work at Certain Affinity. At Certain Affinity Sinclair worked on games and series including Call of Duty, Halo, and Doom. Sinclair left Certain Affinity in 2015 to work at IVxIV Software, which he founded in 2012. IVxIV has worked on games such as RWBY: Grim Eclipse and created websites that help create Big Brother / Big Sister matches. \n\nEddie Smith worked making matte paintings for the game. Smith left Bungie in 2006, and since then has worked for companies including Sony Online Entertainment, Day One Studios, DeNA and Microsoft. Smith is currently art director at Soulbound Studio. \n\nMatthew Soell worked doing additional Bungie.net support. Soell joined Wideload Games in 2003 as lead writer. In 2013 Soell joined Certain Affinity, where he still works.\n\nRob Stokes worked as a mission designer for the game. Stokes left Bungie in 2007 and co-founded Moonshot Games in 2009.

During his time at Harmonix Stokes also worked with Harebrained Schemes on Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall. Also during this time at Harmonix he worked designing levels for Moonshot games. Stokes left Harmonix in 2013 and joined ArenaNet in 2014, where he currently works.\n\nSteve Vai worked providing additional support for the game. Vai is a famous guitar player, and was on three of the game's tracks.\n\nNathan Walpole worked as an animator for the game and its cinematics. Walpole left Bungie in 2008 to work on Halo 4 at 343. He then joined ZeniMax Online to work on Elder Scrolls Online for a year and in 2013 began to teach at Champlain College. \n\nLee Wilson worked providing additional support for the game. At the time Wilson worked as a freelance storyboard and concept artist. He joined Bungie in 2005 and left in 2012 (he is credited as an additional cinematic artist for Destiny). Wilson then worked with Sucker Punch on Infamous until 2016, when he joined V1 Interactive.\n\nMichael Wu worked as a single-player environmental artist. Wu left Bungie in 2011 (they are credited in Destiny's credits) to work at EA. Wu worked on Dead Space 3, and left in 2013. Wu currently works at Cleveland Institute of Art where they teach.\n\n---\n\nOk, that was a lot of people.

During E3 2013 preparations, Bungie was getting ready to demo the game for the first time before a huge audience at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), the biggest U.S. video game show. Activision was going to play the game music with a trailer, but shortly before E3, Activision took over the trailer work and supplied its own music, rather than the Music of the Spheres segments.\n\n> O’Donnell reacted angrily and believed Activision had overstepped its proper role by assuming artistic control of the trailer music. Ryan, the CEO of Bungie, and management shared his concern and filed a “veto” letter with Activision, which overruled the objection. During E3, O’Donnell tweeted that Activision, not Bungie, had composed the trailer music. He also threatened Bungie employees in an attempt to keep the trailer from being posted online and interrupted press briefings.\n\n**tldr** Marty o'donnell was/had control over the musical production rights of destiny, including the music used for promotional material. Activision began re-cutting the trailers and marty felt bungie wasn't doing enough to support him. \n\n**note** Some reports from the studio was that marty was over-focused on the music of destiny and wasn't doing enough to properly support other audio aspects like voice recording (that wizard came from the moon). He was more interested in working with Paul McCartney and creating the \"Music of Spheres\". After the incident he would remark publicly about his disenfranchisement, and his performance dropped off at work.\n\nThere were other comments about him kinda playing up his role too much and pulling away too much attention from other composers, musicians, and artists on the game. He was also very open about his political views and that got him into hot water from time to time (there were a couple twitter incidents).\n\n\nessentially, Marty was a polarizing figure at Bungie, the Activision fiasco was the straw that broke the camels back. Money was tied up in contracts which required settlement, bungie lost, paid out what was owed, and life goes on.\n\n### Comment ID dgne8bo with +15 score by [(Robertej92, Reddit, 2017-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/672n45/what_the_people_who_made_halo_2_are_up_to_now/dgne8bo/) (in reply to ID dgn5pj6):\nI'm not sure how big their team was at the time but I've got a feeling having a look at the team that made the original KOTOR could be interesting, I know a couple of them are the guys behind The Banner Saga and there's been a lot of departures in recent years so could be a fiar bit of variety there.\n\n#### Comment ID dgvrjh0 with +1 score by [(Forestl, Reddit, 2017-04-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/672n45/what_the_people_who_made_halo_2_are_up_to_now/dgvrjh0/) (in reply to ID dgne8bo):\nThe Banner Saga was made by former The Old Republic people, not KOTOR people. \n\nWith that said, I've looked up over 100 people who worked on KOTOR and am almost ready to start editing.

Marty had creative differences with the way Destiny was being handled. As many of us know, Destiny saw a complete change in what it was going to be in 2013 and dropped its story in favour of the game model it represents today (this is partly why Joe Staten left as he had been writing the story). It was massively inconvenient but something Marty could get around. Then the marketing team decided to use licensed songs instead of Marty's composed music, something no Bungie game had done since Marty had been at the company.\n\nI can't remember the exact details but either way it was like a snub on Marty's work. After that, they cancelled the release of his \"Music of the Spheres\" record which was supposed to release before Destiny. Marty was justifiably pissed and made his complaints known. Harold Ryan, the then CEO, had the Board of Directors come together to fire Marty without final pay. It was a sour note to end such a long partnership. Marty then sued Harold Ryan and Bungie for his final pay. He didn't do it out of spite but simply to receive what he was rightfully owed.\n\nNow as one of the founders of Highwire Games, he is in a much happier environment and has a prequel soundtrack coming out before the release of Highwire's first game which will have its own soundtrack.\n\n**TL;DR** Due to creative differences, a reworking of Destiny, and a less than ideal working relationship, Marty was fired without pay and sued the then-CEO and the company for his pay. He is doing much better now at the studio he helped found.\n\n### Comment ID dgnhoiv with +96 score by [(A_Manly_Soul, Reddit, 2017-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/672n45/what_the_people_who_made_halo_2_are_up_to_now/dgnhoiv/) (in reply to ID dgner8r):\nFiring Marty was really shitty of them.

It's been 10 years since I worked with Halo 2 as it was preparing to be launched. I was a QA worker on contract working in the secondary QA group at Microsoft. Each game had their own QA group, but sometimes the mundane and boring work was given to us. One example is listening to make sure the engine sounds for each Forza car was working properly and putting it in an excel sheet.\n\nOne of the best moments working there was that we were asked to help out in the Halo 2 LAN development. We had to leave our QA office and go to Bungie's office across the way to play in thier studio. (This was prior to Bungie having their own offices a few years later.)\n\nThey were very very very anal about LAN gaming as they had my team and other teams working on it for a few months. Those days we 8 guys would sit in a cramp room and play Halo 2 for a while as we tried to not to have too much fun. \n\nSometimes they'd fudge the ping to see how it affected gameplay, or would ask us all to do some sort of action like quit prior to the game starting or during. Usual  things that a player might expect. \n\nThe best moment was when we were testing out Headlong for that day as it had just been finished. That afternoon, half the team had to get out of their seats and entered in a few Bungie team members and we played 2 or 3 games with them. I think I only got 2 or 3 kills on Bungie, but they were ruthelessly unstopable and schooled us QA guys. I was just happy I had beat a few of the devs. \n\nAnyway, the game has been in my heart as one of the best games I tested while being at the job (Fable being #2) and was probably the best time in my life and Xbox's life. So many of the systems best games were being tested in that time. Makes me happy so many loved it as well after it's launch.\n\n### Comment ID dgz2m4c with +1 score by [(ybfelix, Reddit, 2017-05-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/672n45/what_the_people_who_made_halo_2_are_up_to_now/dgz2m4c/) (in reply to ID dgo5moe):\nSo if you don't mind what's with Xiamen?

Thank you!\n\nHe made a site too: [https://halo.statrepo.com/](https://halo.statrepo.com/) so you can enter your gamertag and get your stats.  Sounds like there's hopes of an api coming in time, but I know that will take some time, especially for  hobby project...\n\nI'll also just add that this is not a cheap feat to accomplish... the site above says \"Hosted by [Bstack.NET](https://Bstack.NET)\" at the bottom.  I checked it out, looks like a typical hosting site with the services you'd expect, but that seems like it'd be a good way to support him if you're looking for hosting.  Looks like a smaller company to me, so it might be better to give your money to them vs just going with another one of the big guys...\n\nI'm just so happy someone took this on.  I know a lot of people aren't that interested in this data, or the site itself, but I know it was and is important to at least some of us.\n\nThanks again, u/B1GSTACK!\n\nEdit:\n\nSome of you have asked for updates, so here's one.  Halo 2 data is almost done being loaded.  The database in total looks like it will end up being \\~3.8 TB.  Front end is under construction.  Thanks for your patience everyone, a reminder that the team doing all this all have day jobs, so just like Halo Infinite, it will be ready when it's ready haha.\n\nu/B1GSTACK said he's going to work on a Patreon for anyone that wants to contribute.  The amount of people that care about this is probably not a huge number, but the amount of resources that went into scouring and archiving all the data is pretty hefty, and I think any contribution would help, if nothing more than a sign of appreciation.  Nothing's up yet, but we'll update once it is!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1/16/2022 Edit: \n\nSeveral users have inquired about seeing their service record via archive.org in the mean time, so I want to lay that out for you here.  First, you should check if a wayback machine snapshot exists at all for your gamertag (replace the REPLACE\\_THIS\\_WITH\\_YOUR\\_GAMERTAG text with your gamertag): \n\n[https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=http://halo.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/default.aspx?player=REPLACE\\_THIS\\_WITH\\_YOUR\\_GAMERTAG&output=json&from=1996&to=2021&filter=statuscode:200](https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=http://halo.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/default.aspx?player=rocketman287&output=json&from=1996&to=2021&filter=statuscode:200)\n\nIt will return a list of snapshots available.  If it returns \\[ \\] only, then unfortunately your service record was not captured by wayback machine while [halo.bungie.net](https://halo.bungie.net) was active.  I'm among those, so you aren't alone.\n\nNext, if it does return a list, all you need to do is adjust the following to view any snapshot of your service record:\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/REPLACE\\_THIS\\_WITH\\_TIMESTAMP/http://halo.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/default.aspx?player=R](https://web.archive.org/web/20210115220340/http://halo.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/default.aspx?player=sangh3ilisold3r)EPLACE\\_THIS\\_WITH\\_GAMERTAG\n\nLastly, you can repeat the above process with any url of interest, like the Halo ODST, Halo 3, Halo2 career stats, file share, etc... (the tabs across the top of player service record)\n\n[http://halo.bungie.net/stats/halo3/careerstatsodst.aspx?player=R](http://halo.bungie.net/stats/halo3/careerstatsodst.aspx?player=Rocketman287)EPLACE\\_GAMERTAG\n\n[http://halo.bungie.net/stats/halo3/careerstats.aspx?player=](http://halo.bungie.net/stats/halo3/careerstats.aspx?player=Rocketman287)[R](http://halo.bungie.net/stats/halo3/careerstatsodst.aspx?player=Rocketman287)EPLACE\\_GAMERTAG\n\n[http://halo.bungie.net/stats/playerstatshalo2.aspx?player=](http://halo.bungie.net/stats/playerstatshalo2.aspx?player=Rocketman287)[R](http://halo.bungie.net/stats/halo3/careerstatsodst.aspx?player=Rocketman287)EPLACE\\_GAMERTAG\n\n[http://halo.bungie.net/stats/halo3/fileshare.aspx?player=](http://halo.bungie.net/stats/halo3/fileshare.aspx?player=Rocketman287)[R](http://halo.bungie.net/stats/halo3/careerstatsodst.aspx?player=Rocketman287)EPLACE\\_GAMERTAG\n\nIt might take some iteration since each link might be timestamp independent.  I.e. fileshare url might have snapshots, but the file urls themselves might have been captured in a different snapshot or not at all.\n\n9/12/2022\n\nHey everyone, I figured I'd post a benign update since it's been a while.  Obviously things really slowed down on this project.  I had some life changes, and u/B1GSTACK and his team had some other stuff come up too.  There have been discussions of getting things going again, it just depends on time available.\n\nThe biggest impact has been the decline of remote work as an option.  2 years ago we could all do our regular jobs while monitoring the bungie.net shutdown without any issue, so there was no problem moving quickly for that.\n\nThat's no longer an option for me, and I'm sure u/B1GSTACK and company are feeling it too unfortunately. ( Btw his team has been doing all the data processing, architecting, development, etc... I've mainly just done the PR for this project, and some development work, so we're in contact through this, but not related otherwise). \n\nSo we haven't forgotten, we do care, but external things have slowed several of us down, so we've just been trying to manage through all that.\n\n10/28/2022\n\nHi everyone, just wanted to share something I've been wokring on in the meantime while the stats project continues in development.  I made [halosnapshots.com](http://halosnapshots.com) so you can search your gamertag for any old snapshots from the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.  Some gamertags weren't scanned, mine included, but I hope this helps at least some of you!\n\nThe stats project is still in development.

After games its just some rank history of each player.\n\n[data-sample-games](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/data-sample-00.PNG)\n\n[data-sample-games2](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/data-sample-01.PNG)\n\n\\*more to come soon. Working out some queries for some show and tell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update (3/18/2021)**\n\nData is still being imported. We just recently surpassed the 1 billion game mark so we are over half way! Probably \\~week left to finish. Here are a few images of some large numbers and I/O operations.\n\n[data\\_import\\_Tables01](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/data_import_progrsss_01.PNG)\n\n[data\\_import\\_Tables02](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/data_import_progrsss_02.PNG)\n\n[data\\_import\\_Tables03](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/data_import_progrsss_03.PNG)\n\n[data\\_import\\_Tables04](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/data_import_progrsss_04.PNG)\n\n[data\\_import\\_IO](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/data_import_progrsss_05.PNG)\n\n**Update (3/14/2021)**\n\nData is loading into a database as we speak. Been going in a few days now.  We are 40% of the way through. This is a TON of Data and Processing. But we are on pace. We have reached over 16,000 rows a second entered. Due to some structures we already have one table that's well over 6 billion rows and were over 700GB in size.  We are on NVMe for now 4TB hoping it all fits. I will say if any of the big storage vendors wish to have a \"sponsors by slot\"  we will gladly accept any part maker that wants to sponsor storage or ram we won't say no.\n\n**Update (2/22/2021)**\n\nI have posted up a sample of the data we have gathered so you can see what we are working with. Database design is in final review.  I have posted a zip for download. This is 1 file from each of our data folders.  [Halo - Data Sample.zip](http://cdn.halorepo.com/raw-data-samples/Halo-Bungie-Data-Sample.zip)\n\n**Update (2/9/2021) :**\\-  Its all over boys and girls!  ... We got everything we were hoping to get and then some.... Stay tuned for some updates... My team is going to get some rest and then start the hard part.\n\n**Update (2/8/2021) :**\\- Going good!  H2 cleanup is complete... That leaves a few items and some HeatMaps for GTs with most played games as well as some known players and big names.\n\n**Bungie** or a 343 employee that wants to arrange a data / file dump... I am ready willing and more than able store it. DM me.\n\n**Updates (2/6/2021):**\n\n*Questions / Comments / Contact us ---* ***Discord*** *-  bigstack*\n\n\\- We have completed all available game IDs of Halo 3. (some \\~1.9 Billion ish)\n\n\\- We have Completed Halo 3 Summary/Overview pages  for 22+ million Gamer tags ( page with medals and global stats like K/D games played etc)\n\n\\- We are 80% complete with the Rank history page of 22+ million Gamer Tags (the one that shows the date you achieved rank) ... This is expected to finish Sunday.\n\n\\- We are 85% done Halo 2 Games. This is expected Sunday with cleanup for any nulls games happening on last day Monday.\n\nThis has been a massive effort by a team of 3 people. Writing scripts , modifying, building status checks, checks to verify data, and re-pulling of data.  After the rate race is over with getting data, we will be working on creating a site where data is viewable and can be queried for some interesting stats and information that you wouldn't even find on the main site.  While this might not be the final home (we have other domains) information for now will be located at [halo.statrepo.com](https://halo.statrepo.com). (stay tuned)\n\n**Some interesting facts / images:**\n\n\\- Halo 3 Game data (game info + carnage report / score board  for \\~1.9b games comes to \\~1.9 TB of RAW JSON formatted data. Thus number is growing as I unpack the zips.\n\n\\- Halo 2 will come out to be a little shy of \\~1TB\n\n\\- After scanning all of Halo 3 games for GTs we came out to well over 22+ million unique GT's that played Halo 3 (final numbers will be available I'm spit balling with what I remember from a week + back)\n\n\\- Summary Data for H3 tags \\~ 700 GB raw JSON format\n\n\\- Over all servers in use to grab this data we were averaging \\~3 Gbps (when all servers were running with a full job set). This was \\~95% of the time and has been going since the announcement.\n\n\\- There are over 200 CPU cores running at pretty much \\~95+ % for the past \\~2.5 weeks.\n\n**----- More updates / info to come**\n\n**--- Let me know what you want to see or any questions you have.**\n\nSome images:\n\nH3 Game Info - [H3-games-sample.png](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/H3-games-sample.png)\n\nH3 GT Extract from Games - [GT-into-Database.PNG](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/GT-into-Database.PNG)\n\nH3 GT Summary - [gt-summary-sample](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/gt-summary-sample.PNG)\n\nH3 Rank History - [h3-rankhistory.PNG](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/h3-rankhistory.PNG)\n\nH2 Games - [h2-games.PNG](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/h2-games.PNG)\n\nServer CPU / Bandwidth (htop) - [server-stat-cpu-bandwidth.PNG](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/server-stat-cpu-bandwidth.PNG)\n\nStatus Checker (looks at total done per folder in tree) -> [status-checker.PNG](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/status-checker.PNG)\n\nServer Job Files - [h3-hist-files.PNG](https://halo.statrepo.com/process_images/h3-hist-files.PNG)\n\n### Comment ID gmpg2l1 with +4 score by [(greyfox19, Reddit, 2021-02-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/l6jzpb/halobungienet_data_archive_almost_done_thank_you/gmpg2l1/) (in reply to ID gmcbvg3):\nU legend <3 I got screenshots but it’s not the same.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're saying though?\n\nIn the mean time you can try archive.org, they have dinner gamertags captured from Bungie.net\n\n#### Comment ID hssmo3s with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/l6jzpb/halobungienet_data_archive_almost_done_thank_you/hssmo3s/) (in reply to ID hspwqwx):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID hssmu16 with +1 score by [(Mybed_issoft, Reddit, 2022-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/l6jzpb/halobungienet_data_archive_almost_done_thank_you/hssmu16/) (in reply to ID hspwqwx):\nAhh apologies, yeah I worded that a little weird!\n\nI have played them all, but I played Halo 3 like religiously back in the day so I mainly just wanted to see those stats.\n\nI tried to get on Halo 3 a week ago to check my service record before they cut Multiplayer services for good but didn’t get the chance so was pretty much looking for anyway to look at the stats, when I found this post!\n\nOhhh alright, well I’m extremely looking forward to whenever it goes live!

It was my C# Regex / Webscraping \"Hello World,\" and it was a lot of fun to give people a way to look at their data with different pivots.  You could plot your clans attendence, chart which hours you do poorly, figure out which friends should be ranked and which were... more social (WinPctWithPlayerOnTeam - PersonalAvgWinPct  < 0).\n\nI even started up a conversation with someone that was pushing for a standardized cross-genre stats collection schema (didn't go anywhere, unfortunately).\n\nMy ancient website: [Halo 3 Statistics Tracking Utility (don't have the H2 URL unfortunately)](http://darkphibre.com/HaloStatTracker/index.htm)\n\nSomewhere I have a few screenshots of a prototype I wrote, that would layer in all the bomb paths a clan would take the bomb. :P\n\nI also had an unreleased fuzzy logic engine that would analyze your enemy's Halo Wars strategies by pulling up the last 10 matches while everyone was in the loading screen. I was hoping to figure out how to have it verbally announce (rather than just show probabilities over time in a complicated chart).\n\n---\n\nAt the time I worked on SQL Server Analysis Services... but it was my passion for Halo and game statistics that kept my focus on Xbox (I joined the Advanced Technology Group a few years later, helping studios with XAudio2 surround-sound implementation, Kinect audio, XMV, and XHV stacks).\n\n9 years ago I joined 343 Industries during Halo 4 to architect a new generation of statistics gathering for the next title... and an amazing team of devs helped bring it to fruition. Our telemetry system was (may still be) unparalleled; I gave a GDC talk a few years back on the creation of it. \n\nDuring the H5 beta, we tracked every bullet fired and its trajectory. :D On Halo 5's launch, we generated more events than the combined annual transactions of the world's stock exchanges (as far as I could tell). We were 10x the published numbers of the next closest publisher (and that was for all events from several hundred mobile titles). Someone left in a bug that spammed an event during the loading of Warzone... but *hey*, the tech stack stood up without breaking a sweat. The people working on the Halo franchise are among the brightest and most passionate I've come across, and every day's been a privilege, working on something that means so much to so many (myself included).\n\nI don't work on the public-facing services, but it's my *understanding* that, while Halo Waypoint doesn't render the heatmaps for H5, a subset of the the telemetry is collected available to anyone with an app token:  [<MatchEvents> developer portal (haloapi.com)](https://developer.haloapi.com/docs/services/58acdf27e2f7f71ad0dad84b/operations/Halo-5-Match-Events?). (addressing some of the comments elsewhere about the state of Halo stats)\n\nOh, right! I performed the statistical analysis / heatmap on Red vs. Blue target acquisition, confirming there was a subtle disadvantage for red-team players vs. blue with the original HSL selection (which may have had more to do with lighting engine, a long story, but regardless we made a tweak to improve the balance). You can read my writeup half-way down this waypoint article: [https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/a-whole-new-ball-game](https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/a-whole-new-ball-game)\n\n---\n\nI owe a lot of my career to my passion around Halo statistics.

I think faking out the opponents (or encouraging more unique plays) would become common.\n\nIt's one reason many games don't show you who you're matching against until your in-match... In earlier Halos, people would see clan tags and would bail before the lobby was full (and early-disconnect wasn't recorded against you). People would also quickly look up KD and decide to stay or bail to ensure the outcome.

I created a Halo 3 stats website called MetaHalo.com. It never got huge, but I had a few thousand users and it was popular among the really competitive ranked players. At the time it stood out because it was the only stats site that would go through your game history and pull the data from each match, and I also implemented algorithms that ranked players by skill more accurately than any other site. With this I was able to provide lots of cool statistics not provided by Bungie or other websites, such as in-match playtime and the ability to search for matches based on an endless amount of filters, like gamertags or even ranks. I had some other fun features such as the ability to add multiple gamertags, so players with several accounts could see their true lifetime totals.\n\nWhen Reach came along, I used the API to augment the ladder system for BigTeamBattle.net.\n\nThanks for the nostalgia blast!\n\n### Comment ID gjfdlpp with +1 score by [(MuckingFagical, Reddit, 2021-01-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/kxg09u/halobungienet_is_going_offline_permanently_on/gjfdlpp/) (in reply to ID gjbdoh1):\nIs Halo 3 Statistics Tracking Utility still working?\n\n\nI tried to install it but its asking for NET Framework 2.0, I've installed 4.8 from the Microsoft link it prompts me with.\n\n### Comment ID gl8i73n with +1 score by [(I_DONT_NEED_HELP, Reddit, 2021-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/kxg09u/halobungienet_is_going_offline_permanently_on/gl8i73n/) (in reply to ID gjbdoh1):\nI'm kinda late to the party, but here goes: are there any plans to use this data to create working multiplayer bots?

Focused fire, sometimes flanking, patrols... it's *relatively* rudimentary but gives the impression of cohesive strategy (there's actually a mission plan per combat, and many aspects of Campaign reactions are pre-ordained). See this great paper:  \n[https://web.cs.wpi.edu/\\~rich/courses/imgd4000-d09/lectures/halo3.pdf](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~rich/courses/imgd4000-d09/lectures/halo3.pdf)\n\nMultiplayer bots are a completely different beast. They have to have tactical awareness of the map as a whole, understand chokepoints and zones of control (you don't want to run through a door if you are on defense and could lock it down from a more protected vantage point, etc.).\n\nCan't speak to future plans, but this is why it's always been a challenge. The bots could probably leverage the existing underlying framework, but entirely new decision trees would have to be spun up.\n\nOh, and making those decision trees feel *human* is something I haven't even touched on.\n\nAs far as the usefulness of the data... yeah, we could probably train a neural network to act like a player, but it wouldn't be easily *tunable,* *understandable*, or *performant.* Those three metrics are pretty danged important to have a consistent experience for the player base.\n\nIt's definitely a request that's been raised time and again, but it' is a huge challenge.\n\nHave a good one!\n\n**-me**\n\n### Comment ID gltpghs with +1 score by [(nintendo9713, Reddit, 2021-02-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/kxg09u/halobungienet_is_going_offline_permanently_on/gltpghs/) (in reply to ID gjbdoh1):\nWhat were you gamertag(s)? I just finished my final push for a script to save 'offline' ASCII version of Halo 2 and 3 stats.  It's not the web pages, but it's at least something.  You can run the Python script or .exe [here](https://github.com/nintendo9713/HaloStatProject), but I'm happy to run it for you if you don't feel like dealing with it (I abandoned all structure and stopped documenting because I wanted it over as soon as possible, so it's not as polished as it should be).\n\nPrints out players played with the most w/ count, highest rank achieved and the game that it was achieved, and map based K/D.  They had it on Halo 3's site, but it's cool seeing Halo 2.  \n\nI wish I would have known about your Halo 2 Stat tracker back in the day as I was pretty obsessive as a teen over them.  I've probably ran this for 30+ friends of mine and at this point 40+ redditors who were interested.  Now it's just one week of running it for whoever might be interested.\n\n#### Comment ID gm5r625 with +1 score by [(Darkphibre, Reddit, 2021-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/kxg09u/halobungienet_is_going_offline_permanently_on/gm5r625/) (in reply to ID gltpghs):\nThanks a lot for the offer!

Just exploring halo.bungie.net again, and nothing to make you feel old like realizing the site you used to frequent on most of your weekends in high school by now has a distinctly *vintage* late aughts feel to it.  To be more frank, it feels straight up archaic.  I miss Bungie's old website.  It was definitely more about function than style, and their site hasn't been the same with Destiny.\n\nI am sad this is happening, but more bluntly, I'm disappointed to see it happening so suddenly.  Not to say taking down a dead website after nearly 10 years left me not enough time to look at it, but I frankly would have appreciated more than 3 weeks notice that they're about to nuke it.  Ah well.\n\nIt's a sad day, and definitely a clear sign that the Bungie we used to know has moved on.  I have personally kept up with Destiny over its time, so I admittedly already knew that.  But you always want to believe that old charm, that old continuity, that old culture still exists in some small way, even if it's just in the fact that the company refuses to let a dormant website die, insisting that it stand as a monument to their old identity.  That all ends soon.\n\nThis isn't even to mention all of the content that will die with it.  This is, of course, the important part.  All the legacy stats, all the screenshots, all the heatmaps, this entire snapshot in time from 2004-2011, just...gone.  Sigh.\n\nI don't blame Bungie.  Like any online service, their old website was going to die eventually.  Things can never again be like they were in those old times.  As much as they wish they were, 343 is no Bungie.  They don't understand how to build a community in quite the same way.  They don't put as much heart and skill into creating an in-depth look at stats and other things on their website.  They are competent, and we will have many more good times with Halo, but hey... the glory days are over, aren't they?  And the death of halo.bungie.net is just another reminder.\n\n### Comment ID gjbgnhm with +27 score by [(Toodlum, Reddit, 2021-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/kxg09u/halobungienet_is_going_offline_permanently_on/gjbgnhm/) (in reply to ID gjb5lfj):\nMost game companies are just too corporate now and have lost that special touch.

It’s not surprising to see them become corporatized.  They have had multiple massively successful franchises, and their shooting gameplay mechanics and art team remain the gold standard in the industry, even today with Destiny 2.  And they are publishers now, not just developers.  That inherently comes with a business side of things the original Bungie guys would never have wanted to touch.  Things have changed.\n\nAs for Halo, I don’t know if I think 343 is all bad.  As much of a mixed bag as the franchise has been since Halo 4, I think that we have still had some extremely high highs with 343, but *much* less consistently.  But, for example, Halo 5’s multiplayer is fantastic and it’s clear to me that it was built by people with a passion for the Halo gameplay formula.\n\nWe just don’t get the whole entire package anymore with 343.  Our comprehensive stats that we used to love are gone.  Community involvement still exists under 343, but it does feel distinctly more corporate and sanitized than it did with Bungie.  I guess what I am really saying is, I think 343 routinely delivers *solid* Halo experiences (like H5 MP or HW2) - the problem is that they also sometimes try to spoon feed us bowls of shit (MCC on launch).  That didn’t happen under Bungie.\n\n### Comment ID gjblsl0 with +8 score by [(iBaconized, Reddit, 2021-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/kxg09u/halobungienet_is_going_offline_permanently_on/gjblsl0/) (in reply to ID gjb5lfj):\nWell said.

They even had for Halo 3 a dedicated page to your progression in trueksill rank and when you hit each rank or how far you managed to get. Heatmaps included for the matches you played and any video or screenshots player uploaded from the match you were in were linked as well, it even showed the rank each player was in the match when it was played at that time. It was so easy to use before a ranked match started I could look up players on the enemy team and see how they did their previous matches to size up the competition.\n\nNothing comes close to that these days for Halo. I've tried using places like Halo tracker and MCC stats but they both have a lot of missing data and MCC stats seems to not record more than half the matches I play so its literally fragmented stats (these are fanmade sites so can't be hard on them though, waypoint stats just aren't that great either and for MCC really buried to get to and good luck trying to go many matches back in time lol).\n\n#### Comment ID gjantpv with +26 score by [(Zack21c, Reddit, 2021-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/kxg09u/halobungienet_is_going_offline_permanently_on/gjantpv/) (in reply to ID gjam3wx):\n>and text on ONE page (what a concept modern day stat track websites, get with the program lol).\n\nA lot of this is because of a push to make those sites mobile friendly.

When mcc came to pc, they went to work collecting all of the best maps they knew about and created megapacks for each game. You can download these megapacks, and add them to the game folders in mcc, they're all playable.\n\nThey did excellent work finding, testing, and fixing maps/gametypes. Is it a complete collection of everything? No. But it is a collection of all the classics from halo on halo, to jenga, fat kid etc in halo 3, to speed halo, puzzle/parkour maps like flaming ninja and everything in between. \n\nBack in fall of 2019, 343i did a one time transfer of file shares from Xbox 360 servers to mcc pc servers for 3, reach, and 4. Meaning everything on your fileshare at the time of the transfer was brought over to pc. In order to download this, you'll need the respective games on mcc and when prompted to login with your Xbox account, use the one you had for 360. You should then be able to access your file share for each game and download the maps, gametypes, and screenshots. I'm not sure about clips.\n\nThere is a plan for a file browser to be added to mcc. So while all the most popular maps and gametypes are there from the megabucks, the smaller, more obscure stuff is probably still floating around on people's file shares. I assume with the file browser you would be able to look up specific gamertags and download their files.\n\nOn terms of all the site pages. This tweet claims to have archived everything but I have not tested it. https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1349924896286121987?s=21 \n\nThere are a couple other ways to archive smaller parts of the site. You can upload individual urls to waybackmachine. While it would be too much work to upload everything, you can upload everything relating to your account. https://www.httrack.com/page/2/en/index.html with this site (which has been posted in this thread already) is I guess a site that allows for archiving web pages and downloading them so you can view them?

They’ve been doing a LOT of housekeeping on the website and engine work for Destiny 2, which is good for their projects now and future, but is of course a little sad for Halo. Really wish other companies would try and take after them, you can pick up bounties (side missions), manage your characters’ inventories, invite and join teams, manage clans, and a bunch of other stuff on the website and app. Another one of the things they’ve kept doing is having a public API, so third party app developers can develop their own very helpful tools, like one that cross references your pvp history with twitch so you can find streams of you playing with or against your opponents.

      "# Post ID t0cjnx: I made a browser extension to claim earned rewards from any previous Season Pass on Bungie.net with +6162 score by [(ninth_reddit_account, Reddit, 2022-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/t0cjnx/i_made_a_browser_extension_to_claim_earned/)\n**Edit 10th June: Season pass rewards for seasons before Risen are not able to be obtained through the API**. That data just appears to have been deleted, with no way to obtain them. Rewards from seasons from Risen onwards are *currently* work through the extension, but each season has a higher chance at seasons becoming unavailable.\n\n---\n\nEdit: The extension has been pulled by Mozilla from the Firefox Addons site after being up there for over a year. I'm trying to get it back up, but hard to know when it'll be back** https://hachyderm.io/@joshhunt/110103218325074678 \n\nIt's a bit more effort, but you may be able to install this manually in your browser's dev mode https://github.com/joshhunt/season-pass-extension/#installing-a-release \n\n---\n\n\nI made a Destiny browser extension that lets you pull Season Pass rewards from *any* previous season directly on Bungie's website, as long as you earned them during that season. No need for Android, Bluestacks, or weird APKs!\n\nIt's called Season Pass Pass and it's available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/season-pass-pass/).\n\nInstall the extension, log into Bungie.net and use the pop up menu to override the \"Previous Season\" on Bungie.net to claim rewards you earned but forgot to claim from any previous season pass.\n\nRemember, once you’ve finished with it remember to uninstall/disable the extension in your browser settings. I tried to be as careful as possible, but you don’t want it interfering with Bungie’s site when it doesn’t need to :)\n\n**Edit:** I [just tried and verified this still works](https://twitter.com/joshhunt/status/1582380432892768257) as of 18/10/2022. This extension does not let you earn rewards (beyond the level 1 Exotic) from season's you have not played - you can only claim rewards you actually earned by did not claim.\n\nExact steps:\n\n - Use Firefox and install the Season Pass Pass extension. Don't try and bother around with the Chrome extension, it's just a bunch of hassle when the Firefox one works easier\n - Visit https://www.bungie.net and log in. Do not yet go to the Bungie season pass rewards page\n - Open Season Pass Pass extension menu (the little yellow ticket), click 'Change previous season', and select the season you wish to claim rewards from\n - Click the 'Previous Season' link in the extension to go to that season's season pass and you'll be able to claim any rewards you did not claim during that season.\n\n> **I get an error about missing permissions, or not playing Destiny 2**\n\nThis is probably because you have two accounts (e.g. Playstation and Steam) linked, and it's picking the wrong one. Either unlink the account you don't play, or activate cross save (which essentially disables it in the API anyway)\n\n> **Does this work on mobile/Opera GX/Internet Explorer/Samsung Smart Fridge?**\n\nI don't know, probably not. It's a Firefox extension that I tested in Firefox on Windows and Mac. If you can install Firefox extensions on your mobile device or Nintendo DS, see if it works and report back for others, but you're on your own!\n\n> **Can I claim rewards from seasons I haven't played?**\n\nProbably not, no. Some people have reported being able to claim the season pass exotic from level 1 from seasons they didn't play - I guess because that rank is just a gimme when you log in.\n\n## Comment ID hy8upum with +1253 score by [(ninth_reddit_account, Reddit, 2022-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/t0cjnx/i_made_a_browser_extension_to_claim_earned/hy8upum/) (in reply to ID t0cjnx):\nP.S.

Is anyone else experiencing this problem?\n\nNow when I go on \"Season Progress\", then click on \"previous season\", then activate 'Season Pass Pass', when I go to reload the page, the page is just blank. When I try and go to the current season page, it is also blank. \n\nWhen I reset the 'Season Pass Pass' so it is inactive, and then reload the season progress, the page is also blank. If I navigate back to [bungie.net](https://bungie.net) it works fine, and the other pages also work via [bungie.net](https://bungie.net) e.g. triumphs, collections and game history, however when I click to Season Progress I also get a blank screen.\n\nThis is occuring on both firefox and chrome and makes me suspect that Bungie have changed something behind the scenes. I am open to any suggestions.

I came back for Witch Queen.\n\nAt that time I bought the standard edition of Beyond Light, and the Deluxe Edition of Witch Queen, both for Xbox.\n\nAs expected, because I had the standard edition of BL for Xbox and didn't play at the time (to buy the seasons individually), I couldn't use this extension to claim the starting items from the past BL seasons.\n\nSo, I scared up a Steam key for the Beyond Light Deluxe Edition, and activated it on Steam. Logging in on Steam, I received some of the BL Deluxe entitlements (old pre-order items etc).\n\nAnd the cross-save page shows that I now have BL on the Steam side -- but it doesn't note any edition.\n\nI was hoping this would let me claim the pass level 1 items (i.e., exotics, class armor) from the missing seasons, as I should now have the past pass entitlement on my account, from having the BL Deluxe edition on the Steam side  — but no go.  I get the error \"You do not have permission to claim this reward. (1686)\". This is with the Steam account showing as active in the dropdown on the previous season page.\n\nThe issue is with the Seasons of the Hunt (Premium Class Rewards, Duality), Chosen (Premium Class Rewards, Ticcu's), Splicer (Cryothesia) and Lost (Lorentz Driver). I'm able to claim rewards (earned, or level one if unplayed) from all other seasons the extension accesses.\n\nAm I out of luck?

Making every game a 50/50 toss-up with relative accuracy is exactly what makes the game feel so stressful. You feel like you need to play at your best to get a win in every single game, every single playlist. And I love competitive play so I can tolerate a good bit of that, but if I ever want to relax or I'm playing with really casual and/or drunk friends, 4v4 social is basically off the table.\n\nIt's also absolutely bonkers that Hoberman's Ranked matchmaking parameters have *looser* restrictions than Infinite's social parameters. Halo 3 is giving you Ranked games where players are underdogs, favorites, and equally matched in more or less equal distribution. Infinite is matchmaking every single match to be down to the wire in every playlist as much as it can.\n\n### Comment ID ka11uv7 with +265 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka11uv7/) (in reply to ID ka0id0f):\nI used to play Halo highly competitively.

It’s that the same parameters are used for social non-ranked playlist as well. so there’s no balance between when you want to play sweaty and ranked.

TrueSkill wasn't reset seasonally, it never showed how close you were to ranking up.  It would basically lock after a certain number of games.  So grinding Ranked to get a higher number wasn't popular. You could start a new account if you thought you were upset about your rank but most people didn't bother.  Now that we've added time pressure and a progress bar to the equation anything other thing than perfectly balanced matches feel bad because they aren't worth as much algorithmically.  \n\nEither intentionally or by accident Ranked players aren't playing because they enjoy the game or because they enjoy winning.

Precision weapon starts, reduced power weapon options, no radar, team damage on.\n\nThe old dev is saying 33% splits of easy, fair, challenging matches. Halo Infinite only provides 50% splits of fair & challenging matches.\n\nWhile both models are good, surely the social lobbies deserve an attempt at the 33% model?\n\nAs it stands if I solo queue a social match, I'm expected to draw 30+ kills, <15 deaths and still lose the CTF objective due to three teammates of skill ranging from \"born without thumbs\" to \" I deliver power weapons to the enemy team\". While the enemy team is typically made of a solid D1-D4 bunch that can play objective and win with negative KD.\n\nWhile the 33% model won't fix my teammates, it may reduce the consistent enemy roster stacking vibe.\n\n#### Comment ID ka4l02i with +1 score by [(ManufacturerSea1384, Reddit, 2023-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka4l02i/) (in reply to ID ka124xz):\nYou will run into the occasional person who can’t stand the idea that SBMM isn’t already perfectly.

If the ideal mix is 3 games getting stomped, 3 games stomping, and 4 games that are even matches, then no matter how well you play the game, whether you are an incredible player or a bad one, you're always going to have a roughly equal amount of wins and losses. At which point, what's the point of ranked? Whats the point in playing when the outcomes is predetermined? \n\nPlus it begins to get into the psychology of it, meaning that its trivial for them to inject micro-transactions at the points that people are most susceptible, or maximizing engagement. \n\nIt's a hard problem to solve ideally because it's a bit hard to say what's the ideal solution.\n\n#### Comment ID ka2ibhm with +6 score by [(coke_and_coffee, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka2ibhm/) (in reply to ID ka237gd):\nNot at all.

Just because I sweat it out in ranked and hit onyx one time, the game then predicts I will preform to that quality, *all the time.* So it pits me against impossible odds in silly game modes when I'm just trying to have  fun. Yes I know I ranked high one time. That doesn't mean I want to fight nothing but Onyx full stacks every single match to ensure it's \"fair\" or give me the worst team imaginable because it thinks I'm a good player and will make up for the 3 level 1s on my team. I am not going 32/0 every game. I am lucky to break even game, lol.\n\nMy favorite is when you do waaaaay better than the game expected, (and in a funny social game like super fiesta) and so the next game it tries to knock you down a peg to make it \"fair.\" Game really put me in a match that it predicted me to go 5/20 in, and I did even worse. All because the last game it expected me to go like 10/10 and I went 30/10. \"Well shit, she was way too good, better put her against tougher people for a while.\" If you play to win, the sweat cycle just repeats itself and the game puts you in progressively more and more difficult down to the wire matches to keep it \"fair\" and \"even.\" I tend to play a few rounds here and there where I just go like 0/30 so the game gives me a few  fun rare matches here and there out of pity, lol.\n\n### Comment ID ka749pn with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-11-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka749pn/) (in reply to ID ka0id0f):\nCrazy we had this shit figured out two decades ago.

It's a completely different experience if you are getting thrown into constant evenly matched games with complete randoms all the time vs if you are in a string of closely contested games but it's with 50-75% of the same people in the lobby each game.\n\nI also think it also allows the game to make competitive AND fun matches through better team construction.  Instead of a game being close because either you or one other person on your team carried your team isn't fun but if the game is able to take what the players did in the past game and then move people around it can make it better.  Sure sometimes if 1 or 2 players are too good or too bad it will always be lopsided but then like you said the fun can be from seeing if your team can \"pull off the upset\" and actually win vs the highly skilled player.\n\n### Comment ID ka0u6zt with +24 score by [(white_collar_hipster, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka0u6zt/) (in reply to ID ka09jny):\n\"Party up\" needs to be a thing again\n\n### Comment ID ka0bih3 with +75 score by [(rybl, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka0bih3/) (in reply to ID ka09jny):\nSeriously, I have more memories of random people who I met or got into it with in Halo 3 post game lobbies than I do for infinite even though I haven't played halo 3 in a decade.

Making friends in-game serves two purposes:\n\n1. It further drives player retention (players are more likely to stick around longer if they find some people they vibe with) which, in turn, increases the chance said players will ultimately purchase something from the game's web store (which, for F2P games is what it's all about).\n2. Which game are you more likely to tell your 'outside' friends about? The one where you just go in, shoot a bunch of guys, and leave. Or the one where you can actually engage with the people you're shooting at (and are shooting back at you). Social engagement is a huge factor when it comes to bringing people into a product.\n\n### Comment ID ka1oyms with +2 score by [(Feelosopher2, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka1oyms/) (in reply to ID ka09jny):\nI don't like to say 343 *need* to do many things, because I think the Halo fan base is really opinionated and nit picky at times, but I will die on the hill that lobbies **need** to come back.\n\nIt brings the heat of the game way down, or at least lets each team blow of steam by trash talking, or just joking around.

We just have better ways to balance teams after the match is found, so games are more \"even\" but a quick look around shows that people are matching almost any skill level in social games. Teams are usually made _after_ matchmaking identifies a pool of players, not before, contrary to what most players seem to think.\n\nHe's probably got a point in most other games out right now, I don't know much about a lot of other matchmaking systems, but Halo Infinite isn't actually all that removed from his system, we just have better skill indicators and can form teams a bit more evenly from a lobby and can do it way faster even with way fewer players.\n\nPeople's problem with social isn't that SBMM is too strict, it's an artifact of it being _very loose_ but then balancing those loosely defined players into two somewhat similar teams, leading to higher skill gradients on one or both teams due to probability of skill in a given match. Still even get stomped or get to stomp, just you might be carrying dead weight or be the dead weight (which funny enough, I remember happening plenty in H3 too, people just forget that's how stomping in loose SBMM works most of the time).\n\nOh and Infinite also does per-playlist SBMM. Problem is, it can be accurately calculated within like 2-3 games and most people aren't that far outside of their average from one playlist to the next, so it doesn't \"feel\" like it's different\n\n## Comment ID ka1jb2g with +7 score by [(DankiusMMeme, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka1jb2g/) (in reply to ID 17zmjfs):\nConversely it's really unfun to feel as if the algorithm dictates wins.

A very different thing than what people think it is doing.\n\nCurrent SBMM's issue is that players are not willing to wait the 2-4 minutes it used to take to get teams equalized based on *player* skill rather than *team* skill, so it just focuses on slapping teams it thinks are equal together rather than players and you wind up with the \"*1 Competent Player and 3 Bots*\" issue we have today.\n\nIt still boils down to the same core issue though; do you value making matchmaking as fair as possible for everyone as often as possible?

So if you get whooped, that's almost entirely on you. In MOBAs, everyone has a defined role so you can blame your bad support player instead.

But due to the sheer skill level, and the hero composition / picking you can still stomp / be stomped and have wildly varied matches despite the strict, but very good, SBMM.

Of course, not the only reason but I personally think it makes it worse.\n\nHalo being more about map control and power weapons also makes it worse than CoD, where you are pretty much always on the same power level as your opponent.

You listed basically every game that has a competitive foundation.\nDota cs apex league  Valorant \n\nAll of those games that are sweaty even in their casual modes (aside from obvious shit like aram) these are games that flourish in 50/50 scenarios because they’re built that way. People go into these games expecting that kind of experience. Halo isn’t that tbh. It can be, which is why it’s had a healthy ranked system, but it was also just a run and gun fps during its rise and peaks in multiplayer gaming. The majority of the gamers in halo 2 for example weren’t dabbling in MLG settings over all the other game modes. \n\nMax states in the screenshots that the evenly matched games are the most stressful because it comes down to the wire. But he says this isn’t a bad thing it’s just better when you’re given stomp matches and humbling ones. Currently halo infinite is JUST evenly matched games and each match is unnecessarily stressful. Ranked and unranked. Your point is right, those games do have strict SBMM and works for them - but those games are not halo.

People will complain that all their games are really sweaty and they want a tigher SBMM.  But the problem they are facing is because of a tight SBMM and they should be asking for a looser SBMM so they get some more of those games where it's an easy win.\n\nI think one reason it's not brought up in some of those other game types is because those are single player so it's a lot easier for the game if it only needs to find 1 other person playing who is in your skill level.  I play MLB the Show and play some ranked occasionally and it even shows you what range of ranks it's searching for and it will slowly shift that range if it's not finding anyone.\n\nAlso I think some other games out there have better ranked play where your rank actually matters.  I've never really played but isn't like a really big deal in League of Legends if you are a gold level or diamond or whatever?

A very different thing than what people think it is doing.\n\nDon't the images in the OP's thread say this already? The old systems had a balance between games where you're ahead, games where you're behind, and equal, down-to-the-wire skill. And the current systems in most games go way too hard on the third option and don't bother with the first two, which ends up causing the most stress. Evidently, the old system is more preferable to the current one, even if it did purposely give you games where you're outmatched. \n\n> Current SBMM's issue is that players are not willing to wait the 2-4 minutes it used to take to get teams equalized based on player skill rather than team skill, so it just focuses on slapping teams it thinks are equal together rather than players and you wind up with the \"1 Competent Player and 3 Bots\" issue we have today.\n\nThis is a separate issue with the matchmaking. A matchmaking system can both go too hard on the \"creating equal skill matchups\", and also fail to account for making sure everyone on the team is on equal skill levels vs the overall team's skill. \n\n> It still boils down to the same core issue though; do you value making matchmaking as fair as possible for everyone as often as possible? Or do you value your personal experience and feelings more and to hell with everyone else? \n\nThis is what the thread in the OP addresses, and I personally do think the old way of having a mix of outmatched (in both directions) + equal games is more fun. But the bigger issue that I have, by far, is the unranked vs ranked split. Old halo 2 and 3 had unranked playlists where skill was an extremely small factor and was per playlist, whereas in infinite, your skill level from fucking *Husky Raid* is factored into your ranked matchups. And you have unranked infinite playlists like the halo 3 playlist or quick play having the same strict sbmm as ranked, resulting in extremely sweaty matches all the time. This is the biggest issue for me personally, because halo didn't thrive on being a sweatfest, and needs actual unranked, casual options. \n\n> EDIT: And a food for thought question; why does this debate basically only happen in shooters? In RTS, MOBA, Fighting Games, Sports Games etc. this debate basically doesn't exist at all and if it does people are usually saying \"Hey, SBMM isn't tight ENOUGH because people are getting into matches they shouldn't be in\". \n\nAll of those games are meant to be extremely competitive, and halo is not meant to solely focus on being that competitive. It needs a good ranked option for those that do, but for a majority of people, they just want to jump into a 10 minute game, have fun, and move onto the next. Whereas a MOBA is meant to be a competitive game that demands an equal matchup.\n\n#### Comment ID ka253k6 with +3 score by [(Long-Train-1673, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka253k6/) (in reply to ID ka0wfuc):\nWhy are fighting games inherently more competitive in unranked than fps unranked?

If I remember right, the TrueSkill2 paper says it is something like 65% accurate at predicting historical Halo 5 match outcomes, while TrueSkill is more like 50% accurate. If it's a better at evaluating skill, then it will be better at assembling an \"even\" matchup.\n\nI doubt that the old system was actually deliberately biasing anything to force lopsided matchups to either ego boost or humble people who were \"due\" for either of those. I suspect it was just worse at predicting outcomes and had matchmaking bands that were broader and which implies that variance will make you the best in the room sometimes and the worst in the room sometimes.\n\n>EDIT: And a food for thought question; why does this debate basically only happen in shooters? In RTS, MOBA, Fighting Games, Sports Games etc. this debate basically doesn't exist at all and if it does people are usually saying \"Hey, SBMM isn't tight ENOUGH because people are getting into matches they shouldn't be in\".\n\nI've never seen people complain in Forza about wanting *more* 12 year old rammers in their lobby. I have seen Fall Guys players complain about SBMM, though. It's the same as Halo players, where they want the who boost of curb stomping and can't handle being 5th best in a room of very good players. It's like the high school valedictorian going to college and finding out they're not #1 in the class anymore.\n\nWhat's funny is you see people make that complaint about Halo as well. They complain about how they had to carry 3 bots, which is really \"these players aren't good enough for a lobby with me\". It's framed as them having to \"sweat\" to win because of those inferior players. They don't take the next step of \"the matchmaking needs to be tighter to prevent this from happening\", but instead what they really want is a team of 4 competent players vs 4 bots.\n\n### Comment ID ka0w90j with +3 score by [(HerpToxic, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka0w90j/) (in reply to ID ka0d3do):\nYou wrote a lot of words but you ignored the central theme to Max's posts.\n\nSBMM is **not fun**\n\n#### Comment ID ka0zveg with +5 score by [(GooeyPig, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka0zveg/) (in reply to ID ka0w90j):\nRight, but don't you see, wanting to have fun in a game is UNFAIR to everyone else.

Therefore, individual skill becomes a key measurement unit for the team to win or lose.\n\nA moba shooter (say for example Overwatch), will strictly differentiate roles between the players; even if there is a big disparity in skill, all players can still equally contribute to the team (just think, the healer does not need to be as skilled as the sniper).

The current implementation of it across a variety of games blows. I should not be fighting against monsters after just one game (two if I'm lucky) of me doing well. It has become a running gag in our group of friends, when someone pops off we know the next game is going to be us going against incredibly good players and we are right almost every single time. Play by yourself and do well? Uh oh, the game wanted the match to be even so your team consists of a bunch of players holding their controllers/mice/keyboards backwards. And if you win the match, Congratulations! You get to play an even sweatier game.  \n\n\nI would argue on Halo it is even worse, due to low population of players. I often see the same players back to back to back, and I know that when the best dude of the last game gets put on my team, we're about to stomp. Next game, he'll be on the enemy team, it's time to sweat. The simple solution is to simply have an unranked playlist or \"Social\" where SBMM is almost nonexistent, but with so many playlists in rotation, they might divide the playerbase even more.  \n\n\nHalo and most other online shooters have almost completely abandoned lobbies and other social aspects in favor of protecting Timmy Two Shoes from getting trashed talked, so it is almost impossible to form any type of connections with players on these games. Being able to stay with a team or lobby you liked was huge, I met so many of my lifelong friends because we vibed on Halo 2/3 back in the day.\n\n### Comment ID ka23sy0 with +1 score by [(SpeedoCheeto, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka23sy0/) (in reply to ID ka0j2s0):\nI mean, you pretty much got there.\n\nIt's the way it's implemented that's the problem.\n\nHow do I know this?

In today's games, Halo Infinite included, the matchmaking matches you against players based on a hidden MMR. MAYBE in Halo 3 there were also some hidden things, but even so you still had a surface level *level* that was the priority, that being your visible playlist level (40, 45, 50, etc). And that's the thing with SBMM that everyone argues about... SBMM is fine IF there is a VISIBLE level/rank that we're trying to achieve. A lot of games today even have SBMM in Ranked and your Ranked rank is not even visible. Like, what are we even doing here? Is Ranked not supposed to be this thing where we climb a ladder?

Social play is to be social, to have fun, to relax and enjoy yourself, ranked is for sweats, competitiveness and serious flow.  \n\nWhy companies decided to blur these lines is the problem.  Retention and analytics, data all just to keep that player playing longer, so they might just spend.  \n\nBad. Bad ethical foundation, bad outcome.  It’s that simple.  \n\nThe reason people notice this and the reason people find oddities, is because it logically doesn’t make a good foundation.  It’s too one sided.  \n\nAlso this system like it never has still doesn’t account for human error, AFK, distractions, latency, or anything else, so I say until they can account for that, don’t be so strict, with your SBMM.  Because it’s inherently not a fair system.   \n\nRelax it somewhat, even in ranked.  I’ve played 1500 matches of husky raid and I do not care about getting stomped, what I found had bothered me the most, is when you can’t find people within your bracket of and it loads you into a match above you having a quality experience, but loads you first and foremost using your rating, into a match with terrible latency and connection. \n\nI’d rather the game always be consistently playable, then having (more and more as time goes on) having the game not be playable just because I did good for more matches than it expected of me. \n\nIt also has a tendency to throw me in matches already started and at a loss, or with missing team mates.  Still with my opponents being at my skill rating. \n\nHow’s that fair? how is that worth all of this bullshit? \n\nit’s not.  This is what you get, we traded that for a better on boarding experience for new users, and let’s be honest if you are here, you’d of kept playing regardless.  \n\nThis system is likely to make players who play a lot quit in the long run and never come back compared to getting a few new users in who won’t stay for long anyway. \n\nBasically it bleeds players, due to frustration and the devs act wilfully ignorant of it and don’t even speak out about the bad side of this system.  \n\nWhat you lose instead of what we gained is so disproportionate.  The social problem of this though is more and more people realise it, as they play more and more.  If your a casual player this problem doesn’t effect you much, but play a lot, start grinding your teeth and it’s a common occurrence.  \n\nHonestly, don’t see how people who play +1000 matches can tolerate this shit.  I got to 1500 and just had enough, way to many bad experiences, with latency, connection and unevenness all because I played enough for my rating to rise, as everyone naturally would given enough time.\n\nIt’s all just waiting to display itself to players who play enough and finally get better and for me it clearly was 1500 matches to get really good at a game mode, and this is my reward? \n\nLonger queue times, latency and missing team mates, every 2-3 games.  Yeah, no.\n\nThis is why players who stick with the game derank their rating and purposefully play bad, to get removed from this “degrading ceiling of punishment.”  \n\nWith every system there is a cost, and that is the cost.   People want that and support that? blows my mind.  You’re an idiot if you do, because you’re only going to hurt yourself down the line.  You either don’t understand the problem or have not got to the gate of this issue to constantly experience it for yourself because eventually it’s constant, and the more you play and improve the more it happens.  \n\nBecause you reach the apex of who you can connect with within your bracket and this system puts your rating first above anything else, your fun, your tolerance, your time, it doesn’t give a shit, it just goes “whelp your getting better, let me connect you to these guys over in Mexico where you experience 200ms - 1000ms lag and the game is basically unplayable, because YOUR RATING said so, and nothing else.  \n\nAre people really that stupid, guess so.\n\n## Comment ID ka22g7x with +2 score by [(SpeedoCheeto, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka22g7x/) (in reply to ID 17zmjfs):\nI think that system had a lot of other things going for it; the fact that xbox live BOOMED the market and Halo was uniquely positioned to take advantage. The fact that the core games were fundamentally very sticky and worked very well to hold people's interests. The fact that the campaign of those games were enthralling, turning a ton of people who originally bought for PvE to go and stick around for PvP.\n\nI guess we all forget what it was like to be absolutely hard stuck \\~48 and how fucking obnoxious it was to get served up one of those \"variance\" matches when you're desperate for that to not fucking happen. Sometimes could tell straight up from the lobby that you were about to experience some real pain.\n\nIMO what saved it was the fundamental element of \"win/loss\" was what matters instead of performance and the progression system itself was just extremely enticing. IDK about this systemically designed variable games idea.\n\nThe bell curve piece is confusing and I think probably just could be worded better... obviously both systems would output a normal distribution curve... whether there's an error to each match, algo or enforced variance, doesn't really have anything to do with that? I mean the point is probably salient but \"discrimination\" ... bro, nah\n\nI mean I guess put another way: what's the difference between these -\n\n\\- \"modern matchmaking algo\" with \"a healthy amount of error\" (delta between selected skill of players or teams)\n\nand\n\n\\- Hoberman's that enforced occasional variance\n\nTBH if he had told me the latter is how it worked when I was a kid I would have fucking raged out of my mind when his system served me up a mismatch. Specifically knowing that it intended to do that and that I'm not looking for variance \\*at the moment\\* my presumption is the game is finding me combatants I \"deserve\" to play against.\n\nAnyways, he's taking credit for an awful lot here and it's pretty easy to wave away as \"well good design gets brought forward and... well it didn't\"\n\nKinda hot take but -\n\n* the complaints about modern matchmaking are actually just content creators who have a wide variance of desire (not a thing back then, either); soft matches get them good content they can monetize - so naturally they ask for it. and then the people that parrot the opinion of their favorite content creator\n   * in the middle of the skill band where JoeFortnite is is perfectly pleased with \"fair matches\" because the lobby isn't that skillful in the first place\n* the games they're talking about are extremely popular/successful despite no one using his old design\n   * the money is in JoeFortnite, not esports or influencer opinions\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIDK the specifics to the CoD complaints but the Halo problems seem really obvious to me:\n\n* stop going for the average skill across a whole team. 1 God and 3 Potatoes is AWFUL\n* progression in the system should be totally win/loss based\n* social playlists should not effect ranked playlists, people play totally different\n* stop trying to measure skill. it's too multifaceted and nuanced. just look at wins.\n\ni realize i'm describing a lot of what the old halo system did except for the weird inserted variance. If you want more variance, just increase the allowable MMR range for a match???  \n\n\nAnyways - Fortnite has SBMM. The problem is in how studios implement it/use it. And it probably does have something to do with the philosophical approach Max is describing.

Either you're predicted to win the game, or lose it, with the occasional equal match thrown in for fun. And that he believes this is what players want, instead of what players say they want, which is fair matchmaking as accurate as you can get it. \n\nImplementing a system where you get shit stomped, only so you can shit stomp someone else, is exactly where the frustration in matchmaking occurs. It's ludicrous to think that gaming is somehow any different than literally any other game or sport being played, where the developer of the game forces the outcomes before the match happens.\n\nImagine you watched chess (where all matchmaking algorithms were born from), and the organizer of the tournament picked winners and losers before the game even happens.

I’m really starting to think there are ulterior motives here and there’s no way they can be that incompetent to think their matchmaking is good. Something tells me it was strategically designed this way to keep you around the 50% win rate AKA to keep playing and buying bullshit cosmetics from the store.\n\n### Comment ID ka166rl with +5 score by [(BitingSatyr, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka166rl/) (in reply to ID ka13rgh):\n>designed this way to keep you around the 50% win rate AKA to keep playing and buying bullshit cosmetics from the store\n\nwalk me through the logic of how this makes sense\n\n#### Comment ID ka19cjb with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka19cjb/) (in reply to ID ka166rl):\nUhm the logic would be common sense. If the system is designed to make every game a 50/50 chance of winning or losing then exactly that is going to happen. *In theory* to keep you always wanting more (since in theory you shouldn’t be winning ‘too much’ and get bored) or ‘losing too much’ to make you discouraged from playing any more. Thus keeping you playing their game and spending money on it. At the end of the day they are a free to play *business* and they make their money solely off microtransactions from their cosmetic store. So don’t put it past a business to implement shit like this to keep the money coming in. The people in charge of those decisions could obviously give a shit less about your playing experience and whether it’s fun or not. As long as the checks keep coming.\n\nThe only problem with that system is that it does the opposite of their intention. Max’s system and older Halos were fun because they *could* be extremely competitive at times but focused on the players experience with their friends and how to create a fun environment. It is a video game after all, it shouldn’t be stressful. 343 has proven with each game they have created that this is no longer a priority and they try way too hard to make the game competitive. It drives people away because no one wants to play ranked and get matched up with a bunch of dipshits on your team and the opponents be extremely sweaty, because of some *hidden mmr rank* that supposedly thinks this is even and keeps you ranked where the game THINKS you should be ranked at, instead of actually letting you get to any rank you’re capable of getting. \n\n(An example of this would be to where your mmr and csr either match or are close, and you start getting +7 or +8 for winning but -10 or -12 for losing. How are you ever supposed to progress when that is the case??? When you lose more than you get for winning but each match is still 50/50. You’re not going to be able to progress from that point on because you’re only winning half your matches but losing more points. You combine that with their shit coding and the game crashing 24/7 and losing -15 csr for that and now you’re really fucked. But that’s a whole other issue)\n\nAnd you mix in the bad servers/networking with the super sweaty experience every match and that equates to no one wanting to play your game anymore. So in my opinion it is an extremely stupid and flawed system that had the exact opposite effect of what they intended, and goes to show how out of touch some decision makers in a business can be with their consumer base\n\n#### Comment ID ka1lloc with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka1lloc/) (in reply to ID ka166rl):\nall multiplayer gaming is a form of manipulation now days for people to spend money. the guy with the essay comment is correct. the longer people play a game. be it a session or the entire game life. the more likely they are to spend money in shops. so keeping you winning and loosing and wanting to get better or not end on a loss.

Getting steamrolled is not fun or engaging and I don't believe is better for player retention than matches that are even.\n\nEspecially for unranked if your ass and every game you get shit on you're just going to stop playing instead of being easy fodder.\n\nObviously everyone loves to be the person that steamrolls and those matches are fun but for every great success one player experiences there needs to be great failure and frustrations for 4+ players. IMO \"sweaty\" matches being a problem is an own goal and self imposed issue. The real thing is people expect to win more than half their matches playing casually which is impossible to do without allowing the other half to lose half their matches casually. If you feel like you have to try really really hard to win every game, how about playing more casually and not giving as much of a shit? Within a couple games MAX you will be with people who are at your casual skill level.\n\nIf you want to win every match yes you are going to have to earn it.\n\nThis whole complaint about SBMM is so stupid because no person playing any other game has issues with it. No one would say \"hey why does SF6 have SBMM? Why cant I just stomp noobs all day since I'm in the 20% percentile of skill at this game\" because everyone understands that its fucking stupid.

I think it's interesting to think about the trend of strict SBMM vs. the system Hoberman implemented vs. the old-school server browser.\n\nWhen using the latter, it was a lot easier to find a \"sweetspot\" level of play. But it involved self-curation of matches. Meaning, I join the server, and maybe realize within a couple of minutes that *I cannot hang here*. Or, *those 2 guys are super good but the rest seem average, I'm going to have to watch out for them*. And then it was up to me if I wanted to stay or not. If I'm currently in the mood for a challenge, maybe I will. But maybe I'm tired or wasted and just want to smoke some fools, so I can also go find a place to do that. More agency or control over my experience, in other words.\n\nBut I don't think most players want to do that now. We want the convenience of getting funneled into games automatically but also with the expectation that it will *just work* for my skill level and even for my form today. I feel like Infinite botches this (due to system design and/or population, whatever) but even for the \"better\" implementations of this sort of thing, I think it's a tricky ask to get it to consistently feel good.\n\n## Comment ID ka19qo8 with +1 score by [(UnknownSouldier, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka19qo8/) (in reply to ID 17zmjfs):\nThis explains so much as to why I *loved* playing online on halo 3, but today I can only handle a few games of matchmaking\n\n## Comment ID ka1lr9z with +1 score by [(econ1mods1are1cucks, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka1lr9z/) (in reply to ID 17zmjfs):\nI thought this was that huberman pop psych doucher for a second lol phew\n\n## Comment ID ka1uzvw with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka1uzvw/) (in reply to ID 17zmjfs):\n100% agree with him on all points.\n\n## Comment ID ka1w2ou with +1 score by [(aswankylemon, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka1w2ou/) (in reply to ID 17zmjfs):\nCrazy how Max figured matchmaking out 20 years ago and since then the gaming experience has mostly gotten worse 🤔\n\n## Comment ID ka1xmw3 with +1 score by [(Joke65, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka1xmw3/) (in reply to ID 17zmjfs):\nPREACH, MAX!\n\n## Comment ID ka20mz9 with +1 score by [(Swiftzor, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka20mz9/) (in reply to ID 17zmjfs):\nTbh SBMM can accommodate this level of flexibility but devs won’t do it.\n\n## Comment ID ka213ep with +1 score by [(NowieTends, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka213ep/) (in reply to ID 17zmjfs):\nHe’s spot on as expected\n\n## Comment ID ka222rq with +1 score by [(JUSCALLMEZIMM, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka222rq/) (in reply to ID 17zmjfs):\nI miss the days of ranked and matchmaking,  I can't hardly stand what the new genre of competitive shooters are, they are the same..halo, COD, Battlefield,  all the same concept.

This new-age SBMM has been a disaster for pretty much everyone except for the weakest of weak players. It isn’t just Halo, either. \n       \nWhen it comes to casual / social modes, it almost seems like **no** SBMM is better than what they’re currently doing. There is absolutely no reason for every single match to be this stressful. It feels like the outcome hinges upon never having a down-game, never underperforming, and never making mistakes. Are we seriously trying to punish people from hopping into “Social Slayer” when they’re a little sleepy, haven’t warmed up, or have drank a few beers? In social modes!?\n      \nEven random distribution would be better than the constant teeth-grinding, nail-biter matches. If just one player underperforms the algorithm’s expectations —or gets distracted, chases a challenge medal, or goes AFK— you end up with a landslide loss. \n        \nIt makes infinitely more sense to let the bell-curve handle skill distribution. We all have a natural expectation that “better than average” players should be winning more than 50% of their matches. The incentive for “weaker than average” players is to keep learning and improving so that you, too, can one day win the majority of your games. \n       \nThis current obsession with evenly matched teams has created a system where we see unbelievably weak players dragging great players into 49-50 matches. Nobody should be tallying 41 kills in a 4v4 Slayer match, and they should **never** be in danger of losing when the skill-difference is that drastic. Are we supposed to believe our 1-18 teammate is even having an ounce of fun when they “win” in spite of spending the entire match on the death-screen?\n\n## Comment ID ka2s3vu with +1 score by [(Cost_Additional, Reddit, 2023-11-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/17zmjfs/max_hoberman_former_mponlineux_design_lead_for/ka2s3vu/) (in reply to ID 17zmjfs):\nMatch making was perfect years ago with Halo 2 and 3.

If you were a quad stack, there was a chance you could play a top 8 team (think Triggersdown, Str8 Rippin, Instinct, etc.) or you could play a top 32 team.

The system overcorrects *super* hard, often leading to you either getting put on an absolutely braindead team and having to run a death march to defeat, or getting put on a team *way* above your skill level and ending up at the bottom of the scoreboard, leading to a victory that feels entirely unearned.

Basically it seems that bungie has randomly decided that my bungie account is now, after ten years of playing this game, under the age of 13. Because of this all chat and messaging connected to my account has been automatically locked. I can't even post on the bungie forums themselves for help.\n     So apparently the solution to this is to submit a \"data privacy request\" from help.bungie.net. The problem is that for some reason, i am completely unable to access this form in any way. The bungie help site will under no circumstances allow me to sign in. At every attempt to sign in the site begins to rapidly reload itself, almost as if i was constantly refreshing the page. It's done this up to 27 times in a row (i counted). \n     Now a lot of people have told me various solutions such as trying different browsers, clearing my cache/cookies and even other devices. I have tried this for days now, on chrome, edge, opera etc. I tried on my laptop, my phone, even on my PS5's internet. The same thing happens each time.\n     Now i heard Bungie had really poor customer service, but i am now realizing how poorly insufficient it really is. They have no number to call, no email to reach, nothing. I'm completely stuck and seemingly there is no way to reach anyone or anything that can help me.\n     At this point I'm just reaching out for something, anything, anyone who may possibly be able to help, reach someone at bungie as unrealistic as that probably is. I can no longer interact with the game as I need to be able. I can't even send a simple text message in the lfg app.\n     So if anybody reads this maybe just leave a random comment just so that this can get some traction or notice by someone who can help. Right now, I'm completely helpless on this issue, there is no variation or combination of actions I can take to solve any aspect of this situation. \n     Someone at Bungie please see this, i just want to get back to playing the game without this headache.                          \n                                                                                                                                                                                  \n     Edit: To everyone talking about the request form on Help.Bungie, I am unable to log into help.bungie and have been for five days now.

I went into my PS5 settings and switched it so that my games are tied to my PSN account, not my console. \n\nThis means I need to connect to the internet and log into PSN to access any of my games, but that really doesn't affect me much since I'm the only one in my house who uses the PS5 and it's always online anyway. \n\nThe menu sequence is:\n\nUser and account > other > console sharing and offline play (disable this.) \n\nThat fixed the problem and I can use in-game communication features normally.\n\n### Comment ID lse0hyc with +5 score by [(Academic-Yogurt-1542, Reddit, 2024-10-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1g5no9x/i_am_in_an_impossible_situation_bungie_please_see/lse0hyc/) (in reply to ID lsdnzh4):\nI tried this, and unfortunately no dice.

They pushed people to focus climbing the corporate ladder of roles over focusing on the current role/responsibility. Many people, fostering a social network (\"climb the ladder\") over doing work, leaving a larger workload for others to complete. Many people refuse to give credit to where credit is due. Competition is so fierce that some in that environment would rather take credit for the things they did not do as opposed to give credit to where the credit is due. Just like any place, be sure to know who to avoid and who to chum up to. If you're a quiet one, be ready to do work and get minimal recognition.",

Low base pay vs. the rest of the industry (and they're vocally proud of it). Future bleak and incredibly uncertain. Entire company business plan shifts every few months. Very little time for iteration on projects you just have to do it right the first time or the threat of delays begins to come up.

For example, the internal website frontend for invoking a new build on our in-house build farm still uses Silverlight. You have to use IE compatibility mode in Edge to even load the page properly. And that doesn't even begin to comment on how inflexible and purpose-built the build farm itself actually is, providing almost no support for the rapid growth and expansion the studio has been experiencing. - Company culture is trending in the \"woke\" direction. For some this could be a pro, and in a lot of ways it is a pro, but if you ever disagree with a decision or an action that was taken in the name of \"diversity and inclusion\" then you better not share your opinion with anyone. You will be skewered by other employees and your name will be dragged through the mud behind your back. - Constantly understaffed while always biting off more than we can reasonably chew. Two week sprints literally feel like sprints from start to finish with no opportunity to rest, to evaluate where we are, or to take a look at the bigger picture. - Always focused on and optimizing for what needs to be immediately done, longer-term efforts are always deprioritized and even discouraged. - If you want to work in-person at the office, you need to live in or near Bellevue, WA which is comically expensive. - Recently bought out by Sony. Leadership super pinky swears that Bungie will retain almost all of its independence, and so far that feels like it's been true, but who's to say that will continue to be true if Bungie stumbles in the future? Sony bought Bungie to grow their own business, not as a good-will gesture. It doesn't matter what kind of protections were specified in the buyout details, get enough talented lawyers and you can make anything happen.",

Well, turns out for the last two years of review cycles (every six months) management has been told \"Oh, LAST cycle was actually the big promotion opportunity cycle, this one is just a check in.\" So most people who are brought in under-leveled, and underpaid for their discipline are stuck in a holding pattern with no way upwards unless you're friends with a guy in leadership and can get swapped around between different teams, or work yourself into a burnout oblivion. I have seen multiple cases of gender pay inequity and have heard second hand of multiple bad excuses from HR for why this happens. This was especially frustrating since Bungie constantly likes to remind the public how diverse friendly and supportive they are as a beacon in the industry for change. They have yet to put their money where their mouth is. Then the burnout culture. Deadlines, deadlines, and more deadlines that are always weeks behind, with lofty ideals from studio leadership that is far removed from the production realities. Most people feel like they can't even touch their PTO and get stuck working in terrible cycles until they're about to mentally break. Typically, they get no support from their team leads, and no action is taken to help these individuals work get reallocated to a healthy volume. This is compounded in studio meetings when leadership says \"just take your PTO!\" and their workers can see no reasonable end in sight. Ultimately, it's a boys club, and not one I'd recommend unless you're desperate.",

It typically is great to have junior artist entering the industry however, Bungie has opted to let senior talent go to reduce the overhead cost and that means things that would take a couple hours to do now take a couple days. Bungie is bleed industry leading talent because of their current pay structure. Before COVID they were very competitive with their salary but as time moves on they continue to fall further behind industry pay. As a Principal Artist I make 160,000 but friends I know who left Bungie are making 200,000 or more at smaller studios. Bungie is also loosing and having a hard time getting senior or higher level talent because they fully support geo based pay \"they keep saying this might change\" but as it stands if you don't live in downtown Bellevue or west side of WA you will take roughly a 20% decrease in pay. I was told my salary would go from 160,000 down to 120,000 it I moved roughly 30 miles away from the studio where homes are more affordable. The current employees that stayed at Bungie are currently doing the bare minimum to stay because each year they 1/4th of there big payout that comes from Sony. With that said employees that have only been at Bungie for 5 years have left because their payout is far less then they could make at a different studio. From my perspective several of the incubation projects at this point have been restructured and don't appear to be moving along smoothly and that's very unfortunate because some of them looked really fun.",

While some aspects have improved, such as reduced crunch, the studio seems to have lost a lot of appreciation for veteran talent. Out of necessity, Bungie needs to learn and hire a lot of the publication roles Activision provided, and studio leadership has definitely let the fox guard the hen house in this time because of it.\r\n\r\nAs a result, crunch has become a regular occurrence again, and burnout of the Destiny franchise is real. Many veterans are leaving to other studios formed by Bungie alumni or going elsewhere in the Seattle game dev scene. Those roles are not being backfilled, but rather replaced with a \"do more with less\" attitude, filling roles instead with contractors rather than full time talent we had been clicking on full cylinders with between the Taken King and Forsaken releases. \r\n\r\nThese factors have led to the poorest morale I've seen at the company, which has been declining since late 2018. Leadership says they understand, and will do better, but still keeps leaning into not backfilling jobs and waiting to align on a direction before it's too late to deliver. This has been most obvious on the Narrative and QA teams. Not seeing any improvement in sight, I sadly left the job I thought I would retire at.",

While some aspects have improved, such as reduced crunch, the studio seems to have lost a lot of appreciation for veteran talent. Out of necessity, Bungie needs to learn and hire a lot of the publication roles Activision provided, and studio leadership has definitely let the fox guard the hen house in this time because of it.\r\n\r\nAs a result, crunch has become a regular occurrence again, and burnout of the Destiny franchise is real. Many veterans are leaving to other studios formed by Bungie alumni or going elsewhere in the Seattle game dev scene. Those roles are not being backfilled, but rather replaced with a \"do more with less\" attitude, filling roles instead with contractors rather than full time talent we had been clicking on full cylinders with between the Taken King and Forsaken releases. \r\n\r\nThese factors have led to the poorest morale I've seen at the company, which has been declining since late 2018. Leadership says they understand, and will do better, but still keeps leaning into not backfilling jobs and waiting to align on a direction before it's too late to deliver. This has been most obvious on the Narrative and QA teams. Not seeing any improvement in sight, I sadly left the job I thought I would retire at.",

        "cons": "Bungie continues to bleed talented individuals with years of knowledge and skills in favor of junior artist. It typically is great to have junior artist entering the industry however, Bungie has opted to let senior talent go to reduce the overhead cost and that means things that would take a couple hours to do now take a couple days. Bungie is bleed industry leading talent because of their current pay structure. Before COVID they were very competitive with their salary but as time moves on they continue to fall further behind industry pay. As a Principal Artist I make 160,000 but friends I know who left Bungie are making 200,000 or more at smaller studios. Bungie is also loosing and having a hard time getting senior or higher level talent because they fully support geo based pay \"they keep saying this might change\" but as it stands if you don't live in downtown Bellevue or west side of WA you will take roughly a 20% decrease in pay. I was told my salary would go from 160,000 down to 120,000 it I moved roughly 30 miles away from the studio where homes are more affordable. The current employees that stayed at Bungie are currently doing the bare minimum to stay because each year they 1/4th of there big payout that comes from Sony. With that said employees that have only been at Bungie for 5 years have left because their payout is far less then they could make at a different studio. From my perspective several of the incubation projects at this point have been restructured and don't appear to be moving along smoothly and that's very unfortunate because some of them looked really fun.",

        "cons": "- Insane amount of archaic tooling and systems, oftentimes coupled with opaque proprietary tech stacks. For example, the internal website frontend for invoking a new build on our in-house build farm still uses Silverlight. You have to use IE compatibility mode in Edge to even load the page properly. And that doesn't even begin to comment on how inflexible and purpose-built the build farm itself actually is, providing almost no support for the rapid growth and expansion the studio has been experiencing. - Company culture is trending in the \"woke\" direction. For some this could be a pro, and in a lot of ways it is a pro, but if you ever disagree with a decision or an action that was taken in the name of \"diversity and inclusion\" then you better not share your opinion with anyone. You will be skewered by other employees and your name will be dragged through the mud behind your back. - Constantly understaffed while always biting off more than we can reasonably chew. Two week sprints literally feel like sprints from start to finish with no opportunity to rest, to evaluate where we are, or to take a look at the bigger picture. - Always focused on and optimizing for what needs to be immediately done, longer-term efforts are always deprioritized and even discouraged. - If you want to work in-person at the office, you need to live in or near Bellevue, WA which is comically expensive. - Recently bought out by Sony. Leadership super pinky swears that Bungie will retain almost all of its independence, and so far that feels like it's been true, but who's to say that will continue to be true if Bungie stumbles in the future? Sony bought Bungie to grow their own business, not as a good-will gesture. It doesn't matter what kind of protections were specified in the buyout details, get enough talented lawyers and you can make anything happen.",

Well, turns out for the last two years of review cycles (every six months) management has been told \"Oh, LAST cycle was actually the big promotion opportunity cycle, this one is just a check in.\" So most people who are brought in under-leveled, and underpaid for their discipline are stuck in a holding pattern with no way upwards unless you're friends with a guy in leadership and can get swapped around between different teams, or work yourself into a burnout oblivion. I have seen multiple cases of gender pay inequity and have heard second hand of multiple bad excuses from HR for why this happens. This was especially frustrating since Bungie constantly likes to remind the public how diverse friendly and supportive they are as a beacon in the industry for change. They have yet to put their money where their mouth is. Then the burnout culture. Deadlines, deadlines, and more deadlines that are always weeks behind, with lofty ideals from studio leadership that is far removed from the production realities. Most people feel like they can't even touch their PTO and get stuck working in terrible cycles until they're about to mentally break. Typically, they get no support from their team leads, and no action is taken to help these individuals work get reallocated to a healthy volume. This is compounded in studio meetings when leadership says \"just take your PTO!\" and their workers can see no reasonable end in sight. Ultimately, it's a boys club, and not one I'd recommend unless you're desperate.",

      "# [Wikipedia by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2001-08-02](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie)\nAmerican video game developer\n\nThis article is about the video game studio. For the type of elastic cord, see Bungee cord.\n\nBungie, Inc. is an American video game company based in Bellevue, Washington, and a subsidiary of Sony Interactive Entertainment. The company was established in May 1991 by Alex Seropian, who later brought in programmer Jason Jones after publishing Jones's game Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete. Originally based in Chicago, Illinois, the company concentrated on Macintosh games during its early years and created two successful video game franchises called Marathon and Myth. An offshoot studio, Bungie West, produced Oni, published in 2001 and owned by Take-Two Interactive, which held a 19.9% ownership stake at the time.[3][4]\n\nMicrosoft acquired Bungie in 2000, and its project Halo: Combat Evolved was repurposed as a launch title for Microsoft's Xbox console. Halo became the Xbox's \"killer app\", selling millions of copies and spawning the Halo franchise. On October 5, 2007, Bungie announced that it had split from Microsoft and become a privately held independent company, Bungie LLC, while Microsoft retained ownership of the Halo franchise intellectual property. It signed a ten-year publishing deal with Activision in April 2010.[5][6] Their first project was the 2014 first-person shooter, Destiny,[7] which was followed by Destiny 2 in 2017. In January 2019, Bungie announced it was ending this partnership, and would take over publishing for Destiny.[8][9]\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment completed its acquisition of Bungie in July 2022, with Bungie remaining a multi-platform studio and publisher.[10][11][12]\n\nAmong Bungie's side projects is Bungie.net, the company's website, which includes company information, forums, and statistics-tracking and integration with many of its games. Bungie.net serves as the platform from which Bungie sells company-related merchandise out of the Bungie Store and runs other projects, including Bungie Aerospace, a charitable organization called The Bungie Foundation, a podcast, and online publications about game topics.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBackground and founding (1990–1993)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the early 1990s, Alex Seropian was pursuing a mathematics degree at the University of Chicago, as the university did not offer undergraduate degrees in computer science.[13] Living at home shortly before graduation, his father's wishes for him to get a job convinced Seropian to start his own game company instead.[13]\n\nSeropian's first video game was a Pong clone, written and released nearly 20 years after the original, called Gnop! (Pong spelled backwards). The game was created in 1990, almost a year before Bungie's official incorporation,[14] but was released under the Bungie name and is considered by Bungie as its first game.[15][16] Seropian released Gnop! free of charge, but sold the source code for the game for US$15.[17] Gnop! was later included in several compilations of early Bungie games, including the Marathon Trilogy Box Set and the Mac Action Sack.\n\nSeropian officially founded Bungie Software Products Corporation in May 1991 to publish Operation: Desert Storm.[17][18] Seropian culled funding from friends and family, assembling the game boxes and writing the disks himself.[19] Operation: Desert Storm sold 2,500 copies, and Seropian looked for another game to publish.[17]\n\nSeropian met programmer Jason Jones in an artificial intelligence course at the University of Chicago.[17] Jones was a longtime programmer who was porting a game he wrote, called Minotaur, from an Apple II to the Macintosh platform.[20] Jones recalled, \"I didn't really know [Alex] in the class. I think he actually thought I was a dick because I had a fancy computer\".[17] Seropian and Jones partnered to release the role-playing video game as Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete in 1992; while Jones finished the coding, Seropian handled design and publicity.[20] The game relied on then-uncommon internet modems and AppleTalk connections for play and sold around 2,500 copies,[18] and developed a devoted following.[17] Both Seropian and Jones are considered co-founders of Bungie.[21][22]\n\nThe team focused on the Macintosh platform, not Windows-based personal computers, because the Mac market was more open and Jones had been raised on the platform. While Jones was responsible for many of the creative and technical aspects, Seropian was a businessman and marketer.[19] \"What I liked about [Seropian] was that he never wasted any money\", Jones recalled. With no money to hire other personnel, the two assembled Minotaur boxes by hand in Seropian's apartment.[17] While the pair remained low on funds—Seropian's wife was largely supporting him—the modest success of Minotaur gave the duo enough money to develop another project.[23]\n\nInspired by the shooter game Wolfenstein 3D, Jones wrote a 3D game engine for the Mac.[24] Bungie's next game was intended to be a 3D port of Minotaur, but Jones and Seropian found that Minotaur's top-down perspective gameplay did not translate well to the 3D perspective, and did not want to rely on modems.[20] Instead, they developed a new storyline for the first-person shooter that became Pathways into Darkness, released in 1993. Jones did the coding, with his friend Colin Brent creating the game's art.[25] The game was a critical and commercial success, winning awards including Inside Mac Games' \"Adventure Game of the Year\" and Macworld's \"Best Role-Playing Game\".[25]\n\nPathways beat sales expectations and became Bungie's first commercial success.[19][26] Bungie moved from a one-bedroom apartment to a studio in Chicago's South Side on South Halsted Street;[23] Seropian and Jones's first full-time employee, Doug Zartman, joined in May 1994 to provide support for Pathways, but became Bungie's public relations person, honing Bungie's often sophomoric sense of humor and irreverence.[27] Bungie composer Martin O'Donnell remembered that the studio's location, a former girls' school next to a crack house, \"smelled like a frat house after a really long weekend\" and reminded staff of a locale from the Silent Hill horror video games.[28]\n\nMarathon, Myth and Oni (1994–2001)\n\n[edit]\n\nBungie's next project began as a sequel to Pathways into Darkness, but evolved into a futuristic first-person shooter called Marathon. Pathways had taught Bungie the importance of story in a game,[29] and Marathon featured computer terminals where players could choose to learn more about the game's fiction.[30] The studio became what one employee termed \"your stereotypical vision of a small computer-game company—eating a lot of pizza, drinking a lot of Coke\" while the development team worked 14 hours every day for nearly six months.[27]\n\nAfter showing the game at the Macworld Expo, Bungie was mobbed with interest and orders for the game. The game was not finished until December 14, 1994; Jones and a few other employees spent a day at a warehouse assembling boxes so that some of the orders could be filled before Christmas.[27] The game was a critical and commercial success,[29] and is regarded as a relatively unknown but important part of gaming history.[31] It served as the Mac alternative to DOS PC-only games like Doom and System Shock.[19] The game's volume of orders was unprecedented for the studio, who found that its old method of mail or phone orders could not scale to the demand and hired another company to handle the tens of thousands of orders. Marathon also brought Bungie attention from press outside the small Mac gaming market.[27]\n\nThe first game's success led to a sequel, Marathon 2: Durandal. The series introduced several elements, including cooperative mode, which made their way to later Bungie games.[29] The game was released November 24, 1995, and outsold its predecessor. When Bungie announced its intention to port the game to the Windows 95 operating system, however, many Mac players felt betrayed, and Bungie received a flood of negative mail. Seropian saw the value of moving into new markets and partnering with larger supply chains, although he lamented the difficult terms and \"sucky\" contracts distributors provided.[27] The game released on Windows 95 in September 1996. Marathon Infinity was released the following year.\n\nAfter Marathon, Bungie moved away from first-person shooters to release a strategy game, Myth: The Fallen Lords. The game stressed tactical unit management as opposed to the resource gathering model of other combat strategy titles. The Myth games won several awards and spawned a large and active online community. Myth: The Fallen Lords was the first Bungie game to be released simultaneously for both Mac and Windows platforms.[19][32]\n\nThe success of Myth enabled Bungie to change Chicago offices and establish a San Jose, California based branch of the studio, Bungie West, in 1997.[19] Bungie West's first and only game would be Oni, an action title for the Mac, PC and PlayStation 2.[33]\n\nHalo and Microsoft acquisition (2001–2007)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1999, Bungie announced its next product, Halo: Combat Evolved, originally intended to be a third-person shooter game for Windows and Macintosh.[34] Halo's public unveiling occurred at the Macworld Expo 1999 keynote address by Apple's then-interim-CEO Steve Jobs (after a closed-door screening at E3 in 1999).[34]\n\nOn June 19, 2000, on the ninth anniversary of Bungie's founding, Microsoft announced that it had acquired Bungie and that Bungie would become a part of the Microsoft Game Division. Halo would be developed as an exclusive first-person shooter title for the Xbox. The reasons for Bungie accepting Microsoft's offer were varied. Jones stated that \"I don't remember the details exactly, it was all a blur. We'd been talking to people for years and years—before we even published Marathon, Activision made a serious offer. But the chance to work on Xbox—the chance to work with a company that took the games seriously. Before that we worried that we'd get bought by someone who just wanted Mac ports or didn't have a clue\".[35] Martin O'Donnell, who had joined Bungie as an employee ten days before the merger was announced, remembers that the stability of the Xbox as a development platform was not the only benefit.[28] Shortly before Myth II's release, it was discovered versions of the game could erase a player's hard drive; the glitch led to a massive recall of the games right before they shipped,[19][29] which cost Bungie nearly one million dollars.[19] O'Donnell stated in a Bungie podcast that this recall created some financial uncertainty, although accepting the offer was not something Bungie \"had to do\".[28] Seropian and Jones had refused to accept Microsoft's offer until the entire studio agreed to the buyout.[19]\n\nAs a result of the buyout, the rights to Myth and Oni were transferred to Take-Two Interactive (which at the time owned 19.9% of the studio) as part of the three-way deal between Microsoft, Bungie and Take-Two Interactive; most of the original Oni developers were able to continue working on Oni until its release in 2001.[36] Halo: Combat Evolved, meanwhile, went on to become a critically acclaimed hit, selling more than 6.5 million copies,[37] and becoming the Xbox's flagship franchise.[38]\n\nHalo's success led to Bungie creating three sequels. Halo 2 was released on November 9, 2004, making more than $125 million on release day and setting a record in the entertainment industry.[39] Halo 3 was released on September 25, 2007, and surpassed Halo 2's records, making $170 million in its first twenty-four hours of release.[40]\n\nBuyout and Destiny (2007–2022)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn October 1, 2007, Microsoft and Bungie announced that Bungie was splitting off from its parent and becoming a privately held limited liability company named Bungie, LLC.[41][42] As outlined in a deal between the two, Microsoft would retain a minority stake and continue to partner with Bungie on publishing and marketing both Halo and future projects, with the Halo intellectual property belonging to Microsoft.[43]\n\nWhile Bungie planned on revealing a new game at E3 2008, Bungie studio head Harold Ryan announced that the unveiling was canceled.[44] Almost three months later, Bungie announced that the new game was a prequel and expansion to Halo 3 titled Halo 3: Recon.[45] The next month, Bungie changed the game's title from Halo 3: Recon to Halo 3: ODST.[46] At E3 2009, Bungie and Microsoft revealed the company was developing another Halo-related game, Halo: Reach, for release in 2010.[47] Reach was the last game in the Halo franchise to be developed by Bungie.[48]\n\nBungie continued expanding, though it did not commit to details about new projects and ship dates.[49] The company grew from roughly 120 employees in May 2008[50] to 165 in June 2009, outgrowing the studio Microsoft developed. Ryan helped redesign a former multiplex movie theater in Bellevue into new Bungie offices, with 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) replacing the 41,000 square feet (3,800 m2) the company occupied previously.[51]\n\nIn April 2010, Bungie announced that it was entering into a 10-year publishing agreement with publisher Activision Blizzard.[52][53] Under Bungie's agreement with Activision, new intellectual property developed by Bungie will be owned by Bungie, not Activision, in a deal similar to the Electronic Arts Partners Program.[53][54]\n\nOn June 30, 2011, Bungie announced the \"Bungie Aerospace\" project; its slogan, \"Per audacia ad astra\", translates to \"Boldly to the stars\". The project is intended to provide independent game developers with publishing, resources, and support, including access to the Bungie.net platform.[55] In November 2011, Bungie Aerospace published its first game, Crimson: Steam Pirates, for iOS, developed by startup video game developer Harebrained Schemes.[56] In addition to publishing and distributing Crimson, Bungie Aerospace provided players with statistical support and a dedicated discussion forum on Bungie.net.[57]\n\nIn 2013, Bungie announced Destiny,[58] which launched for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One platforms on September 9, 2014.[59][60][61] During January 2016, Ryan stepped down as president and Pete Parsons, who had been the company's chief operating officer and executive producer since 2002, became its chief executive officer.[62]\n\nChinese video game conglomerate NetEase had invested $100 million into Bungie in 2018, in exchange for a minority stake in the company and a seat on the company's board of directors.[63]\n\nBungie terminated its publishing deal with Activision in 2019, after eight years; as per their agreement, Bungie retained all rights to Destiny and will self-publish future installments and expansions.[64][65][66] This included transitioning Destiny 2 from using Activision's Battle.net to Steam.[67] Bungie's communications director David Dague dispelled ideas that Activision was a \"prohibitive overlord\" that limited Bungie's creative control, and instead stated that both companies amicably split due to different ideas of where the Destiny franchise should head.[68]\n\nBungie announced a major expansion of its firm in February 2021. In addition to more than doubling its headquarters space in Bellevue, Washington, Bungie announced plans to open a new studio in Amsterdam by 2022. This would support additional staff not only for Destiny but additional media related to Destiny outside of video games, as well as a new intellectual property unrelated to Destiny that Bungie expects to release by 2025.[69][70]\n\nAcquisition by Sony Interactive Entertainment (2022–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 31, 2022, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced its intent to acquire Bungie for $3.6 billion. While Bungie would become part of the PlayStation family of studios it would remain an independent subsidiary under Sony in development and publishing and would not be part of PlayStation Studios. Instead, Sony's investment would help Bungie with hiring for developers to expand their work on the Destiny franchise and other planned games. Both companies stated that the deal would not affect platform availability or exclusivity for Destiny 2 but instead was geared towards media beyond video games that Bungie had been interested in pursuing for some time.[71] Bungie, in return, would help Sony enter the live service games market, as Sony had announced plans to launch at least ten such games by 2026 in an investors' presentation following the Bungie acquisition announcement.[72] Sony also said the Bungie acquisition will help Sony to become more multiplatform.[73]\n\nOf the $3.6 billion, Sony anticipated that at least $1.2 billion will be used as incentives for retention of Bungie's current employees.[74] In May, it was reported that the Federal Trade Commission was opening an inquiry into the acquisition, requesting more information about it a week prior. It was expected to delay the acquisition by at least six months.[75] The acquisition was closed by July 15, 2022, making Bungie a subsidiary under Sony Interactive Entertainment.[76][77][78]\n\nBungie laid off approximately 100 of 1200 employees on October 30, 2023, part of a larger cost-cutting measure across all Sony studios. According to Bloomberg News, revenue from Destiny 2 fell by 45% over the previous year due to waning popularity of the game, and work on the next major expansion The Final Shape was not progressing as well as expected. As part of these layoffs, The Final Shape was delayed from February 2024 to June 2024, while their next game, Marathon was pushed into 2025.[79][80]\n\nBungie had initiated legal action against AimJunkies, a group owned by Phoenix Digital that sold software that allowed for cheating in Destiny 2, in 2021, asserting copyright infringement, violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and trafficking in DMCA-violating software;[81] Bungie's initial claims were dismissed but an amended lawsuit allowed the case to proceed. AimJunkies attempted to countersue on claims that Bungie has hacked into the computer of the user that had developed these cheats, but those were dismissed in 2022.[82][83] At trial, judge Thomas Samuel Zilly ruled that Bungie lacked sufficient evidence to allow the DMCA and trafficking claims to move forward but instead sent these complaints to arbitration, where Bungie was awarded $4.3 million in damages.[84] The copyright claims proceeded to a jury trial, which found for Bungie in May 2024. While Bungie was only awarded around $63,000, the revenue made by the sale of the cheat programs by AimJunkies, the result was considered to be significant as it was the first time a jury trial ruled in game cheating software and could carry as case law in future lawsuits. AimJunkies asserted their plan to appeal both the arbitration and trial judgement.[85][86]\n\nBungie announced the layoffs of 220 staff in July 2024, leaving about 850 employees remaining.[2] Future plans including transitioning 155 more into Sony directly. Parsons stated that they had to make this decision \"after exhausting all other mitigation options\", and that these layoffs would allow them \"to refocus our studio and our business with more realistic goals and viable Financials\", with focus on Destiny and Marathon going forward. Additionally, one of the unannounced games in a new IP that Bungie was developing will be transitioned to a new studio under PlayStation Studios.[87] According to journalist Jason Schreier in speaking with those at Bungie, the two rounds of layoffs had resulted from Bungie trying to explore too many new projects too quickly shortly after the Sony acquisition, hiring several new staff and drawing off Destiny developers to pursue these projects, with the expectation from management that they would be able to pull through with \"Bungie magic\" that the studio had been known for.[88] The following October, the Creative Studios arm of Bungie was moved and integrated into PlayStation Studios to help support other Sony live service games, though they would also continue to support Destiny and Marathon.[89]\n\nBungie had 1,600 employees prior to the first round of layoffs in October 2023, according to former chief legal officer Don McGowan. This indicates that the company has lost over 750 employees in less than a year.[90] Also, several teams at Bungie has transitioned over to Sony PlayStation as part of Bungie's integration into Sony.[91] After a second round of layoffs in July 2024, several high-ranking executives seem to have departed, including Chief Creative Officer Jonny Ebbert and Chief Strategy Officer Ondraus Jenkins.[92]\n\nBungie.net\n\n[edit]\n\nBungie.net serves as the main portal for interaction between company staff and the community surrounding Bungie's games. When Bungie was bought by Microsoft, the site was seen as in competition with Microsoft's own Xbox.com site, but community management eventually won out as the bigger concern.[93] The site has been redesigned several times.[94]\n\nDuring Bungie's involvement with the Halo franchise, the site recorded statistics for each game played.[95] This information included statistics on each player in the game,[95] and a map of the game level showing where kills occurred, called \"heatmaps\".[96] On January 31, 2012, Bungie announced that, as of March 31, 2012, Bungie.net would no longer update Halo game statistics and Halo player service records, host new user-generated Halo content, or operate Halo's \"Bungie Pro\" service. Bungie's cessation of these services on March 31 completed the transition process of all data for Halo games being managed by 343 Industries.[97] Bungie.net records player's statistics for their game franchise Destiny. In addition to the collection of data and the management of Destiny player's accounts, the website serves as a form of communication between Bungie and the community.\n\nWhile Bungie had long provided places for fans to congregate and talk about games, as well as releasing new information and screenshots over Bungie.net, it historically had made less effort and been less successful at providing access to the inside workings of Bungie and its staff. As part of a move to become more familiar with fans, Bungie recruited recognized and respected voices from the fan community, including writers Luke Smith, Eric Osborne, and others.\n\nBungie also has an iOS and Google Play application that allows provides news, inventory management, and group finding for their game Destiny on the go.[98]\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nMartin O'Donnell described Bungie's workplace culture as \"a slightly irreverent attitude, and not corporate, bureaucratic or business-focused\";[99] artist Shi Kai Wang noted that when he walked into Bungie for an interview, \"I realized that I was the one who was over-dressed, [and] I knew this was the place I wanted to work\".[100] Bungie's content manager and podcast host, Frank O'Connor, comically noted that at a GameStop conference, the Bungie team was told to wear business casual, to which O'Connor replied \"We [Bungie] don't do business casual\".[95]\n\nThis informal, creative culture was one of the reasons Microsoft was interested in acquiring Bungie,[101] although game designer Jordan Weisman said that Microsoft came close to destroying the company's development culture, as it had with the now-defunct FASA Studio.[102] Studio head Harold Ryan emphasized that even when Bungie was bought by Microsoft, the team was still independent:\n\nOne of the first things [Microsoft] tried after acquiring Bungie, after first attempting to fully assimilate them, was to move Bungie into a standard Microsoft building with the rest of the game group. But unlike the rest of the teams they'd brought in previously, Bungie didn't move into Microsoft corporate offices – we tore all of the walls out of that section of the building and sat in a big open environment. Luckily Alex and Jason [Seropian and Jones, Bungie's founders] were pretty steadfast at the time about staying somewhat separate and isolated.[99]\n\nIn 2007, Microsoft eventually moved the studio to Kirkland, Washington, where it reincorporated as Bungie, Inc.[99] Despite the move, financial analyst Roger Ehrenberg declared the Bungie-Microsoft marriage \"doomed to fail\" due to these fundamental differences.[103] Bungie also pointed out that it was tired of new intellectual property being cast aside to work on the Halo franchise.[99] Edge described the typical Bungie employee as \"simultaneously irreverent and passionately loyal; fiercely self-critical; full of excitement at the company's achievements, no matter how obscure; [and] recruited from its devoted fanbase\".[93]\n\nThe Bungie workplace is highly informal, with new and old staff willing to challenge each other on topics, such as fundamental game elements. Staff are able to publicly criticize their own games and each other.[93][104] Fostering studio cooperation and competition, Bungie holds events such as the \"Bungie Pentathlon\", in which staff square off in teams playing games such as Halo, Pictionary, Dance Dance Revolution, and Rock Band.[104] Bungie also faced off against professional eSports teams and other game studios in Halo during \"Humpdays\", with the results of the multiplayer matches being posted on Bungie.net.[105]\n\nBungie's staff and fans, known as the \"Seventh Column\", have banded together for charity and other causes. After Hurricane Katrina, Bungie was one of several game companies to announce its intention to help those affected by the hurricane, with Bungie donating the proceeds of special T-shirts to the American Red Cross;[106][107][108] after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Bungie sold \"Be a Hero\" T-shirts and donated money to the Red Cross for every Halo 3 or ODST player on Xbox Live who wore a special heart-shaped emblem.[109] Other charity work Bungie has done included auctioning off a painting of \"Mister Chief\" by O'Connor,[110] a Halo 2 soda machine from Bungie's offices,[111] and collaborating with Child's Play auctions.[112] In 2011, Bungie formed a nonprofit organization, named Bungie Foundation.[113]\n\nIn December 2021, IGN reported from interviews with 26 former and current employees that there had been past and some current issues with a male-dominated work culture and crunch time that was discriminatory towards female employees since around 2011, but the company more recently had been working to improve these issues, previously parting ways with the majority of people mentioned in the article. Parsons wrote a response about Bungie's commitment to improve the workplace culture, which had aligned with statements from more recent employees that had spoken to IGN. Parsons apologized to any employee who \"ever experienced anything less than a safe, fair, and professional working environment at Bungie\", and stated of several efforts that the company was making to eliminate any type of \"rockstar\" attitude that may exist at the studio.[114]\n\nGames developed\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Platform 1990 Gnop!

Double Aught was a short-lived company composed of several former Bungie team members, founded by Greg Kirkpatrick. Seropian left to form Wideload Games, developer of Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse, and later co-founded Industrial Toys. Other companies include Giant Bite, founded by Hamilton Chu (producer on Halo and Oni) and Michael Evans (project lead on Oni),[116] and Certain Affinity, founded by Max Hoberman (the multiplayer design lead for Halo 2 and Halo 3). Certain Affinity's team included former Bungie employees David Bowman and Chad Armstrong (who later returned to Bungie). The studio collaborated with Bungie in releasing the last two downloadable maps for Halo 2[117] and the downloadable Defiant Map Pack for Halo: Reach.[118] 343 Industries, a game studio formed by Microsoft to manage the Halo series following the launch of Halo: Reach, also includes a few former Bungie employees, including Frank O'Connor.[119] In 2015, long-time Bungie employee Martin O'Donnell started a new game studio known as Highwire Games.[120] In 2016, former Bungie CEO and studio head Harold Ryan founded a new game studio known as ProbablyMonsters.[121]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",

      "# [Bungie Devs Pushed For ‘Destiny 2’ Player Housing At One Point by Paul Tassi on 2025-01-16](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/01/16/bungie-devs-pushed-for-destiny-2-player-housing-at-one-point/)\nMy favorite Bungie ex-community manager, Liana Ruppert, chimed in regarding a recent question about why Destiny 2 had not added player housing over the years, something that many other games in similar genres, including Warframe, had eventually gotten. The initial question (highlighted via GamePost):\n\n“How has Destiny not added player housing? This feels like a goldmine for playtime, player enjoyment & investment, and monetization?”\n\nThe answer from Liana:\n\n“Oh man, so many devs wanted this when I was there. It’d be so dope but phew would a lot of things need to change in the game and resource-wise internally to make that happen with the ROI at a level that would mark it as a beneficial inclusion. The dreaaaaam.”\n\nSo what this means it that this would take a lot of resources and there was likely not going to be enough of a return on investment to justify that. Though it is also easy to imagine some sort of separate in-store cosmetic being sold to decorate your ship or Last City apartment or whatever it would be, as the original poster says. The main draw for players would be earning fun things to keep there like say, Oryx’s sword after you beat him or Calus’ goblet. Mounting your favorite weapons on racks. The ability to hang out with other friends at your place.\n\nI remember writing about this idea years ago, and I had to go digging to find it. Here’s what I said about how it could function as a long term investment for the game. This was back in 2022, and according to this I had written about it previously (I can’t find those earlier articles, but I’m sure they exist). I said:\n\n“Trophy Room/Apartment/Ship Interior – I have been saying some version of this for years now, but I think we need a literal, physical manifestation of our lifetime triumphs in a way that isn’t just a number or a single title on display. I’m thinking of a physical, personal space like our own version of the HELM that has mementos based on achievements. Titles could equal physical mementos. Descendant Title? Here’s Taniks’ helmet on the wall. Dredgen? A copy of Drifter’s egregore plant that grows after every gilding. Take a crafted weapon to level 30? It can now be mounted in a display case. Complete 30 transmog bounties? You now have an armor mannequin to display a favorite look. It may sound silly, but it would be something that feels like a culmination of everything you’ve done for all these years.”\n\nIt’s heartening to know that at least some Bungie devs were on board with this idea, but it seems irritating that it was shut down when it’s something players clearly would want to see and other games have it, somehow getting around that pesky “ROI” problem.\n\nI also suspect there is some sort of technical complexity to this because well, there is technical complexity with practically everything in Destiny’s aging engine and this is one again one of those “it’s not as easy as it sounds!” problems that always get brought up when new ideas are proposed. Annoying.\n\nFollow me on Twitter, YouTube, Bluesky and Instagram.",

She's been hit!\n\nSometimes I'm amazed this site is still online; it launched in 1999, more than a quarter-century ago, and although it's not quite as lively as it once was, it's still visited by people who love the Halo franchise and love the creations that have been brought into being via that franchise. I have thousands of good memories associated with this site and its community... but few are as cherished as the lanfest I was invited to in 2001, where we celebrated the final chemo treatment of Brian Morden. (If you don't recognize the name, type it into the search bar here; there are plenty of links.) We honor him every February 15, with a symbol on this website... but today I listened to a podcast where his best childhood friend, Brian Johnson, remembered him and his contribution to the Halo universe, and I was reminded, again, how powerful hope can be. (It really couldn't have come at a better time, so huge thanks to Brian - well, both Brians - to the Twenty Thousand Hertz podcast, and to Adam Daniel, who brought it to my attention.) Go listen. it's a great story. (Louis Wu 17:01:36 UTC)",
      "# [Destiny's Future Is Being Shaped by Its Past by James Whitbrook, Justin Carter, Germain Lussier on 2024-06-10](https://gizmodo.com/destiny-2-final-shape-ending-codename-frontiers-bungie-1851530114)\nThis past weekend, I sat down to bring an end to a story I have been following for the best part of the last 10 years of my life: Bungie’s Destiny saga, told across two games, myriad expansions, seasons of living-game content, and many crushing highs and lows, came to what has long been shaped as its first proper end.\n\nIt ended in a way that was perhaps symbolic of these 10 years I’ve spent with Destiny—a game that I have followed ever since it was breathlessly discussed as the next game from the people that made Halo, all the way through to the many times I stopped and started playing again no matter how insistent I was that whatever latest arcane design change or lackluster content drop had failed to hook me was the thing that would make me put it down for good. By which I mean, in equal parts sentiment and perplexed frustration.\n\nThe Final Shape, the game’s latest expansion, released early last week, and I was enjoying it in the moment—with its narrative focused intently, for the first time in years, explicitly on the bonds of friendship between the closest thing Destiny has had to main characters in the form of Commander Zavala, Ikora Ray, and Cayde-6, the emblematic leaders of the Guardian Vanguard, as they prepared to face the Witness, this ancient villain teased through years of esoteric lore and premonitions. But when it climaxed with what was essentially a big cutscene of your player character and the Vanguard running away from the Witness, merely wounding them rather than finishing the job, essentially saying “please wait for the raid to drop” instead of coming to a remotely satisfying conclusion, I found myself perplexed.\n\nHad all this been leading to my character—the same Warlock I made in the original Destiny Alpha, that I remade for the first game in 2014, and have played ever since, for almost as long as I have worked at io9—essentially waiting on the sidelines while people who actually did the game’s challenging raid content would get to see the “real” ending? I’ve never had the time, patience, or frankly the social circle to regularly interact with this particular aspect of Destiny’s famously perplexing and difficult endgame modes, but leaving the cathartic final battle against this long-anticipated foe up to a mode that has, historically, struggled to attract Destiny players beyond the hardest of its hardcore, felt like a damp squib.\n\nThankfully, that wasn’t the case. After the first teams of players raced to be the first to finish The Final Shape’s raid, Salvation’s Edge, it was revealed there was actually one more surprise in Bungie’s arsenal. Defeating the raid unlocked a brand new, 12-player—the first of its kind in Destiny history—fight that anyone who’d finished The Final Shape’s story up to this point could participate in, that saw players and the allies they’d built up across Destiny’s story thus far come together to defeat the Witness once and for all. And it was great! It was the big damn hero moment Final Shape’s campaign had lacked; it was filled with huge fights and the kinds of amounts of enemies, players, and allies alike the game had never tried to cram into one space before; it was challenging but not frustratingly hard. And it was an end! An actual end! There was cutscenes and dramatic catharsis and everything.\n\nBut as my Warlock and I both sat, contemplating everything they’d been through in the years since 2014—gazing out at the Traveler, the giant, superpower-giving space orb that has basically been the symbol of Destiny for that decade—it was clear whatever was next for the game after this chapter had finally closed was going to have to chart a difficult path. Destiny 2 is a living game, it doesn’t just shut off because we beat up this one big threat, it keeps ticking on, even after this moment of great release. As for what comes next? Today Bungie started to lift the lid.\n\nIn a brief new video released this morning, the developer laid out its plans for the next year of content in Destiny 2: three new “episodes” that will roll out across the year that each focus on one of Destiny’s classic antagonistic factions still lingering in the wake of the Witness’ defeat. “Echoes” will focus on the Vex, “Revenant” the Fallen, and “Heresy” the Hive, examining the ways our relationships with those factions have changed in the last 10 years. In some cases, we’ve developed alliances with elements of those factions, turning foes into the friends—frenemies, in the case of the Hive, in the form of the tricksy goddess Savathun. In others, it involves revisiting locations Destiny has long controversially “vaulted”—removed from player access in an attempt to keep the size and scope of the game down—and returning to them with new light and new design sensibilities learned over those same years. Beyond that? Whatever’s really next is still kept close to Bungie’s chest, beyond a nebulous tease for something called “Codename Frontiers,” which suggests finding new horizons to explore beyond the solar system Destiny has largely been confined in up to this point.\n\nIt’s a fitting idea for this transitory period Destiny finds itself in right now, ending one climactic saga and sowing the seeds for whatever’s next. It’s rare to see a game outside of this kind of living format actually grapple with what that transformation means for its characters and yourself as a player—it’s something one of my other great MMO loves, Final Fantasy XIV, has played with as it goes from Endwalker, the expansion touted much like The Final Shape was as the end of a story a decade in the making, and now onto Dawntrail, the impending start of a new saga. To have Destiny structure itself around revisiting factions, places, and mechanical ideas for the way the game is actually played as this living world, and seeing just how far it’s come in this moment, feels like both a great endcap to what’s been experienced and a fittingly Destiny idea: to always iterate, re-explore, and redevelop as it’s adapted and survived a decade of challenges.\n\nIf The Final Shape represents the apex of what Destiny 2 has been capable of so far, going back to these elements with new light—metaphorically and narratively speaking, with the defeat of the Witness no longer clouding our heroes and their futures—is one filled with potential. One that will perhaps keep me playing, in spite of myself, for another decade or more.",

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on Bungie\n\n## Company Overview\n\nBungie, Inc. is an American video game developer based in Bellevue, Washington, and a subsidiary of Sony Interactive Entertainment. Founded in May 1991 by Alex Seropian and Jason Jones, Bungie initially focused on Macintosh games and gained recognition with franchises like Marathon and Myth. The company was acquired by Microsoft in 2000, leading to the development of the Halo franchise, which became a flagship title for the Xbox console. Bungie became an independent company again in 2007, retaining the rights to its new intellectual property, Destiny, which launched in 2014. In January 2022, Bungie was acquired by Sony for $3.6 billion, while maintaining its independence in development and publishing [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Acquisitions and Partnerships\n\n- **Sony Acquisition**: On January 31, 2022, Sony announced its intent to acquire Bungie for $3.6 billion. This acquisition was aimed at bolstering Sony's presence in the live service games market, with Bungie expected to assist in developing multiple live service titles by 2026 [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n  \n- **NetEase Investment**: In 2018, Chinese video game conglomerate NetEase invested $100 million into Bungie, acquiring a minority stake and a board seat [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n### Fundraising Events\n\nBungie's acquisition by Sony was a significant financial event, valued at $3.6 billion, which included plans for employee retention incentives amounting to at least $1.2 billion [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n## Company Scale\n\nAs of October 2023, Bungie had approximately 1,600 employees. However, the company has undergone significant layoffs, with around 100 employees laid off in October 2023 and an additional 220 in July 2024, reducing the workforce to about 850 [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n## Product Overview: Destiny 2\n\n### General Information\n\nDestiny 2 is a multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Bungie, released in 2017 as a sequel to the original Destiny. The game has evolved through numerous expansions and seasonal content, maintaining a dedicated player base. The latest expansion, \"The Final Shape,\" was released in June 2024, marking a significant narrative conclusion to the ongoing saga [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n### New Product Developments\n\n- **The Final Shape**: This expansion concluded a decade-long narrative arc within the Destiny universe, focusing on the battle against the Witness, a central antagonist. The expansion received mixed reviews, with some players expressing dissatisfaction over the narrative's resolution, particularly regarding the reliance on raid content for a complete story experience [(Gizmodo, 2024)](https://gizmodo.com/destiny-2-final-shape-ending-codename-frontiers-bungie-1851530114).\n\n- **Future Content**: Bungie has announced plans for three new episodes in Destiny 2, focusing on classic antagonistic factions. This content aims to explore evolving relationships with these factions and revisit previously vaulted locations [(Gizmodo, 2024)](https://gizmodo.com/destiny-2-final-shape-ending-codename-frontiers-bungie-1851530114).\n\n### Opinions About the Product\n\nFeedback from the community has been polarized, particularly regarding matchmaking issues in the Trials of Osiris game mode. Players have reported long wait times and difficulties finding matches, attributing these problems to low player counts and matchmaking mechanics [(Bungie.net, 2025)](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/264682259?sort=0&page=0). \n\n### Major Changes\n\n- **Layoffs and Financial Challenges**: Bungie has faced significant financial challenges, with a reported 45% drop in revenue from Destiny 2 in 2023. This decline has prompted layoffs and delays in upcoming content, including The Final Shape and the new game, Marathon, which has been pushed to 2025 [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n- **Legal Actions**: Bungie has been involved in legal disputes against AimJunkies, a group selling cheating software for Destiny 2. The case has seen mixed outcomes, with Bungie awarded damages in arbitration but facing challenges in proving copyright claims in court [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n## Executive Leadership\n\n- **Pete Parsons**: The CEO of Bungie since January 2016, Parsons has been instrumental in navigating the company through its transition to independence and its recent acquisition by Sony. He has emphasized the need for realistic goals and financial viability in light of recent layoffs [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBungie remains a significant player in the video game industry, particularly with its flagship product, Destiny 2. However, the company faces challenges related to financial performance, employee retention, and community satisfaction. The recent acquisition by Sony presents opportunities for growth and expansion, particularly in the live service market, but also necessitates careful management of resources and expectations moving forward. Prospective candidates and investors should consider these dynamics when evaluating Bungie's future potential."
