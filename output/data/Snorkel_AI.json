      "# [Snorkel Brand System](https://brand.snorkel.ai/)\nLogos & wordmark\n\nOur wordmark, lockup and Dr. Bubbles mascot play distinct roles in how the Snorkel brand is expressed. On this page you will find the most commonly used variations, notes on usage, and files for download.\n\nDownload logo\n\nSnorkel Wordmark\n\nThe Snorkel wordmark is our primary logo, and should be your go-to for most use cases.\n\nThe wordmark is based on a modified version of the DIN typeface, with custom ascenders and ligatures.\n\nColor variations\n\nThe wordmark comes in two versions, for use against either light or dark backgrounds. Please ensure that the wordmark always has enough contrast to stand out, and avoid placing it on patterned or detailed background imagery.\n\nDownload here\n\nMinimum sizing\n\nPlease check that our logo is at least 80 pixels wide for digital, or 16mm wide for print applications to ensure legibility.\n\nClearance\n\nOur wordmark needs room to breathe and should not be crowded out by other content. This is particularly important when used with other logos.\n\nPlease allow for a minimum space of the x-height (the height of lower case letters) around the wordmark.\n\nMisuse\n\nIn most cases you should follow this one golden rule and you won’t have to worry about irate designers protesting outside your house:\n\nDon’t change the wordmark in any way - no stretching, no effects, don’t change the colors and don’t try to recreate it in any way.\n\nJust for emphasis, here are a few examples of how not to use the wordmark:\n\nDon’t recolor the logo\n\nDon’t use the wrong version on your background\n\nDon’t rotate the logo\n\nDon’t stretch or distort the logo\n\nDon’t reproduce the logo using our brand font\n\nDon’t reproduce our logo using any other font\n\nDon’t use the logo over detailed or densely patterned backgrounds\n\nDon’t cover up faces or image focal points\n\nMascot (Dr. Bubbles)\n\nMeet Dr. Bubbles, our loveable mascot representing the playful side of the Snorkel brand.\n\nWhile Dr. Bubbles' charm can endear it to audiences, it should only be used in a context where the Snorkel brand is clearly established, never standalone.\n\nColor variations\n\nDr. Bubbles comes in three versions, a full color version and monochrome versions for use against either light or dark backgrounds. Please ensure that the logo always has enough contrast to stand out, and avoid placing it on patterned or detailed background imagery.\n\nDownload here\n\nPlease note:\n\nUnlike the Snorkel wordmark, Dr. Bubbles has key design differences depending on the background they are being used on. Please note that a dark background version cannot ever be recolored to work on a light background (and vice versa) as the designs are different.\n\nFull color\n\nMonochrome (dark background)\n\nMonochrome (light background)\n\nUsage\n\nAs with our wordmark, in most cases you should follow this one golden rule and you won’t have to worry about irate designers protesting outside your house:\n\nDon’t change the logo in any way - no stretching, no effects, don’t change the colors and don’t try to train an octopus to wear a snorkel (please, they hate that)\n\nJust for emphasis, here are a few examples of how not to use the logo:\n\nDon’t recolor any part of Dr. Bubbles\n\nDon’t ever invert Dr. Bubbles to fit your background\n\nDon’t use Dr. Bubbles standalone, make sure the context is clearly Snorkel related\n\nDon’t stretch or deform Dr. Bubbles in any way\n\nDon’t use monochrome Dr. Bubbles on detailed or densely patterned backgrounds\n\nDon’t use the color version of Dr. Bubbles on a dark background.\n\nSnorkel Lockups\n\nThere are two versions of the Snorkel lockup combining the Dr Bubbles mascot with the Snorkel wordmark - a horizontal and a vertical layout.\n\nThe lockups should only be used on those occasions where the wordmark on its own might be a little sterile or you want to show off Dr. Bubbles - a conference stand graphic or swag would be good use cases.\n\nColor variations\n\nThe Snorkel lockup comes in four color variations, two full color versions and two monochrome versions for use against either light or dark backgrounds. The ‘Full color alt’ version is intended for use where a darker background makes the wordmark less legible.\n\nPlease ensure that the logo always has enough contrast to stand out, and avoid placing it on patterned or detailed background imagery.\n\nDownload here\n\nPlease note:\n\nAs shown above, the Dr. Bubbles part of the lockup has key design differences depending on the background they are being used on.\n\nPlease note that a dark background version cannot ever be recolored to work on a light background (and vice versa) as the designs are different.\n\nMinimum sizing\n\nPlease check that our lockup is at least 120 pixels wide for digital, or 24mm wide for print applications to ensure legibility.\n\nClearance\n\nAs with our wordmark, our lockup needs room to breathe and should not be crowded out by other content. This is particularly important when used with other logos.\n\nPlease allow for a minimum space of the x-height (the height of lower case letters) around the outer edges of the lockup.\n\nMisuse\n\nIn most cases you should follow this one golden rule and you won’t have to worry about angry designers camping outside your house:\n\nDon’t change the lockup in any way - no stretching, no effects, don’t change the colors and don’t do anything weird with it\n\nJust for emphasis, here are a few examples of how not to use the lockup:\n\nDon’t change the size of any elements\n\nDon’t change any colors\n\nDon’t rotate the lockup or any elements within\n\nDon’t use the ‘Full color alt’version of Dr. Bubbles on a dark background.\n\nOutdated logos\n\nA common issue with Snorkel being mentioned in press releases and even some internal messaging, is that we are seing the outdated ‘Snorkel’ research project logo being used to represent Snorkel AI.\n\nPlease help us identify and correct this incorrect usage wherever you see it.\n\nBelow are some tips to help identify outdated logos.\n\nKey differences\n\nHere are some key differences to take note of when checking if your logo is up to date:\n\nDr Bubbles\n\nYou will notice that the new Dr. Bubbles mascot has less detail - for example there are no bubbles, no shading or suckers on their tentacles. You will also notice that the lines on the new Dr. Bubbles are thicker and use more vibrant colors.\n\nWordmark\n\nThis one is a little harder to recognize, but there are two key differences to look for: The new wordmark uses an upper-case ‘S’ and has a modified ‘el’ ligature - which means they are connected into one shape.\n\nColors\n\nOur palette reflects the aquatic theme inherent in the Snorkel name, Check out and download our color swatches.\n\nTypography\n\nGet a clear picture of our fonts, their colors, capitalization, kerning and leading, typescale, and more.\n\nLogos\n\nUse our logo and beloved Dr. Bubbles mascot with care.

This is particularly important when used with other logos.\n\nPlease allow for a minimum space of the x-height (the height of lower case letters) around the wordmark.\n\nMisuse\n\nIn most cases you should follow this one golden rule and you won’t have to worry about irate designers protesting outside your house:\n\nDon’t change the wordmark in any way - no stretching, no effects, don’t change the colors and don’t try to recreate it in any way.\n\nJust for emphasis, here are a few examples of how not to use the wordmark:\n\nDon’t recolor the logo\n\nDon’t use the wrong version on your background\n\nDon’t rotate the logo\n\nDon’t stretch or distort the logo\n\nDon’t reproduce the logo using our brand font\n\nDon’t reproduce our logo using any other font\n\nDon’t use the logo over detailed or densely patterned backgrounds\n\nDon’t cover up faces or image focal points\n\nMascot (Dr. Bubbles)\n\nMeet Dr. Bubbles, our loveable mascot representing the playful side of the Snorkel brand.\n\nWhile Dr. Bubbles' charm can endear it to audiences, it should only be used in a context where the Snorkel brand is clearly established, never standalone.\n\nColor variations\n\nDr. Bubbles comes in three versions, a full color version and monochrome versions for use against either light or dark backgrounds. Please ensure that the logo always has enough contrast to stand out, and avoid placing it on patterned or detailed background imagery.\n\nDownload here\n\nPlease note:\n\nUnlike the Snorkel wordmark, Dr. Bubbles has key design differences depending on the background they are being used on. Please note that a dark background version cannot ever be recolored to work on a light background (and vice versa) as the designs are different.\n\nFull color\n\nMonochrome (dark background)\n\nMonochrome (light background)\n\nUsage\n\nAs with our wordmark, in most cases you should follow this one golden rule and you won’t have to worry about irate designers protesting outside your house:\n\nDon’t change the logo in any way - no stretching, no effects, don’t change the colors and don’t try to train an octopus to wear a snorkel (please, they hate that)\n\nJust for emphasis, here are a few examples of how not to use the logo:\n\nDon’t recolor any part of Dr. Bubbles\n\nDon’t ever invert Dr. Bubbles to fit your background\n\nDon’t use Dr. Bubbles standalone, make sure the context is clearly Snorkel related\n\nDon’t stretch or deform Dr. Bubbles in any way\n\nDon’t use monochrome Dr. Bubbles on detailed or densely patterned backgrounds\n\nDon’t use the color version of Dr. Bubbles on a dark background.\n\nSnorkel Lockups\n\nThere are two versions of the Snorkel lockup combining the Dr Bubbles mascot with the Snorkel wordmark - a horizontal and a vertical layout.\n\nThe lockups should only be used on those occasions where the wordmark on its own might be a little sterile or you want to show off Dr. Bubbles - a conference stand graphic or swag would be good use cases.\n\nColor variations\n\nThe Snorkel lockup comes in four color variations, two full color versions and two monochrome versions for use against either light or dark backgrounds. The ‘Full color alt’ version is intended for use where a darker background makes the wordmark less legible.\n\nPlease ensure that the logo always has enough contrast to stand out, and avoid placing it on patterned or detailed background imagery.\n\nDownload here\n\nPlease note:\n\nAs shown above, the Dr. Bubbles part of the lockup has key design differences depending on the background they are being used on.\n\nPlease note that a dark background version cannot ever be recolored to work on a light background (and vice versa) as the designs are different.\n\nMinimum sizing\n\nPlease check that our lockup is at least 120 pixels wide for digital, or 24mm wide for print applications to ensure legibility.\n\nClearance\n\nAs with our wordmark, our lockup needs room to breathe and should not be crowded out by other content. This is particularly important when used with other logos.\n\nPlease allow for a minimum space of the x-height (the height of lower case letters) around the outer edges of the lockup.\n\nMisuse\n\nIn most cases you should follow this one golden rule and you won’t have to worry about angry designers camping outside your house:\n\nDon’t change the lockup in any way - no stretching, no effects, don’t change the colors and don’t do anything weird with it\n\nJust for emphasis, here are a few examples of how not to use the lockup:\n\nDon’t change the size of any elements\n\nDon’t change any colors\n\nDon’t rotate the lockup or any elements within\n\nDon’t use the ‘Full color alt’version of Dr. Bubbles on a dark background.\n\nOutdated logos\n\nA common issue with Snorkel being mentioned in press releases and even some internal messaging, is that we are seing the outdated ‘Snorkel’ research project logo being used to represent Snorkel AI.\n\nPlease help us identify and correct this incorrect usage wherever you see it.\n\nBelow are some tips to help identify outdated logos.\n\nKey differences\n\nHere are some key differences to take note of when checking if your logo is up to date:\n\nDr Bubbles\n\nYou will notice that the new Dr. Bubbles mascot has less detail - for example there are no bubbles, no shading or suckers on their tentacles. You will also notice that the lines on the new Dr. Bubbles are thicker and use more vibrant colors.\n\nWordmark\n\nThis one is a little harder to recognize, but there are two key differences to look for: The new wordmark uses an upper-case ‘S’ and has a modified ‘el’ ligature - which means they are connected into one shape.\n\nColors\n\nOur palette reflects the aquatic theme inherent in the Snorkel name, Check out and download our color swatches.\n\nTypography\n\nGet a clear picture of our fonts, their colors, capitalization, kerning and leading, typescale, and more.\n\nLogos\n\nUse our logo and beloved Dr. Bubbles mascot with care. Find logo variations, notes on usage, and files for download here.\n\nFlow patterns\n\nOur with the techno-gradients, in with the limitless patterns.

I think I was just contacted about the same thing you must be doing for them. A recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn saying they're looking for expert contributors in my area. He made it sound super urgent. The gig involves writing multiple choice questions and reviewing those of others. They pay you per accepted question and per reviewed question. I said I'd like to learn more. I literally just got an email from HireArt offering me a contract and asking for some standard hiring info (eg, background check, independent contractor paperwork, etc...). I looked up Snorkel AI and HireArt and both seem legit as far as I can tell, but you know, with all the scams out there and with how rushed it seemed, I am a tad wary. Does what I described sound like what you're doing for them as well? How do you like it so far? Is it tricky to get your questions accepted or would you say it's pretty fair / they're not pulling a fast one on you?\n\n#### Comment ID m3dkmm7 with +3 score by [(devotionanddoubt, Reddit, 2024-12-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/1gtmh52/deleted_by_user/m3dkmm7/) (in reply to ID m3djl12):\nThis is exactly what I did for them!

You can expect problems that focus on data structures and algorithms, often leaning towards the upper end of medium difficulty. The coding challenges might include topics like tree traversals, dynamic programming, or graph algorithms. It's not just about solving the problem, but also discussing your approach and optimizing your solution.\n\nThe interviewers at Snorkel AI are known to value clear communication and problem-solving skills as much as technical prowess. They'll likely ask you to explain your thought process as you work through the problem. Be prepared to discuss trade-offs between different approaches and to optimize your initial solution. If you're feeling unsure about tackling these types of questions, you might find this [interview AI tool](http://interviews.chat) helpful.

From my understanding, they tend to focus on more medium-to-hard LeetCode problems (think 600-800+ questions). One thing that helped me when I was in a similar spot was using this AI tool that listens to the interview and suggests responses in real time. It's not a guaranteed fix, but it made me feel more confident.\n\nTo be honest, my experience with them was pretty standard - they had a coding challenge on HackerRank and then asked some behavioral questions afterwards. They also discussed their company culture and values a bit during the conversation. If you want to know more about the tool I used, I'd be happy to share it with you! \n\nKeep in mind that every interview is different, but hopefully this gives you a rough idea of what to expect.

They don't give a shit about inverting binary trees or other leetcode wankery - they focus on real-world data processing problems. Since they're all about data labeling and ML pipelines, expect questions about handling large datasets efficiently, building robust data processing flows that don't fall over when shit goes wrong, and system design stuff for scalability. One question my friend got was about designing a rate-limiting system for their API.\n\nDon't waste time grinding classic leetcode mediums - focus on distributed systems concepts, concurrency patterns, and how to handle ML data at scale. Their engineers seem to care more about whether you can build systems that won't catch fire in production than if you can solve some obscure DP problem. Oh, and definitely research their core products like Programmatic Labeling - they'll expect you to have thoughts on how you'd operationalize those systems.

It is about phrasing and assessment of specific things. Like: perhaps the best way is to find a paper and ask specific questions about its conclusions. There is an analysis step where you get feedback as to complexity and other parameters. I got the sense that if I asked a question I would get, say, complexity right, upon adjusting phrasing I would lose the complexity part.

After a few weeks to a month of creating questions for them, they’ll send you an email saying you need to verify your identity and educational Background for compliance reasons.

A few days after that email they will terminate you for non compliance. It doesn't matter how many people you email at Snorkel or HireArt, they keep telling you to check your spam folder for an email that was never sent to you (educational verification).

[Label Box](https://labelbox.com/)\n\nWho else should be on the list?   \n\n\n## Comment ID m8wr321 with +2 score by [(HedgehogDangerous561, Reddit, 2025-01-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1i8k7am/ai_teams_looking_for_data_annotation_and_data/m8wr321/) (in reply to ID 1i8k7am):\nFor data security and AI based fast annotation,\n\n[Annolive AI](http://annolive.com) \n\n1.

First, I want to clarify that the topic being discussed in this thread does not relate to any work between Anthropic and Snorkel. We never disclose who we are working for; but we can confirm that there is no connection to Anthropic here!\n\nSecond: we **never** deliver rejected/pending submissions to customers, and we **always** pay expert contributors for submissions that are accepted according to each project’s quality criteria, which we clearly define and share with all contributors upfront.\n\nA lot of our work (again, unconnected to Anthropic!) involves writing complex prompts that “stump” the current frontier models. We understand that hitting the acceptance bar for this work can be challenging, and strive to give clear and constructive feedback for rejected submissions. However, we know that our process isn’t perfect and that during periods of high volume, our review and response times can lag or lack sufficient detail.

The contract is about stumpres. They paid well at the beginning of the project, so we worked hard, long hours. Then they decided that we earned too much and changed the pay process, extending the period between submissions and the payments; but in reality, we continued to submit stumpres, but they stopped paying for them.  They paid for reviewing and other secondary tasks, but not for what is in the contract.\n\n## Comment ID mkjp5kl with +1 score by [(thisdude415, Reddit, 2025-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropic/comments/1jlx84p/anthropic_uses_data_sourced_unethically/mkjp5kl/) (in reply to ID 1jlx84p):\nFor what it’s worth I got paid for my work in December\n\n### Comment ID mkm9mne with +1 score by [(Witty_Philosophy_778, Reddit, 2025-03-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropic/comments/1jlx84p/anthropic_uses_data_sourced_unethically/mkm9mne/) (in reply to ID mkjp5kl):\nAnd I got paid for work in December and January.\n\n## Comment ID mklsayu with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2025-03-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropic/comments/1jlx84p/anthropic_uses_data_sourced_unethically/mklsayu/) (in reply to ID 1jlx84p):\nI don't care, I want Anthropic's AI to be incredibly great\n\n## Comment ID mklumg8 with +1 score by [(ADisappointingLife, Reddit, 2025-03-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropic/comments/1jlx84p/anthropic_uses_data_sourced_unethically/mklumg8/) (in reply to ID 1jlx84p):\nThey do the same thing to red-teamers & safety researchers across the entire space.\n\nAny time you see a competition or 'hackathon', the prize pools routinely break down so even top participants are making less than minimum wage for handing over millions of dollars worth of data.\n\nThe entire space is incredibly vampiric.\n\n### Comment ID mkm0q9a with +1 score by [(robograd, Reddit, 2025-03-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropic/comments/1jlx84p/anthropic_uses_data_sourced_unethically/mkm0q9a/) (in reply to ID mklumg8):\nwhat do you mean by the prize pools break down?\n\n#### Comment ID mkm2nh8 with +1 score by [(ADisappointingLife, Reddit, 2025-03-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropic/comments/1jlx84p/anthropic_uses_data_sourced_unethically/mkm2nh8/) (in reply to ID mkm0q9a):\nI mean that very few of them hire anyone, instead preferring to farm out the research to companies that run competitions or hackathons, where they then harvest millions of dollars worth of data.\n\nOne recent example: Pulse & Toolhouse Ai are sponsoring a \"MCP online hackathon\", with prizes **totalling** $1,000.\n\nPulse raised over six million dollars.\n\nThis is most of ai, at this point.

Despite our imperfections, I am confident that we are filled with kind, caring and empathetic people at all levels in the organization. We care about diversity at this company - we invest in fair and equitable processes in hiring and sourcing talent, and we do our best to ensure diverse people and voices always have a seat at the table. And at the core, we care about our employees - their wellbeing, their sense of belonging and their ability to find success and fulfillment while they’re with us. It’s disappointing to hear that you haven’t seen or experienced this. I do want to set the record straight that we have not had any C-level departures at the company - I’m not sure what you’re referring to with that statement.\n\nWhile I haven’t yet heard this type of feedback from any current or former member of the team, we are very committed to listening and learning about ways we can improve the employee experience.

We are in an environment where people are afraid to speak up, and there is a general distrust between employees and leadership, especially the founders. I'm personally disappointed to see that there needs to be more thought diversity at the leadership level. The leadership speaks about the company's commitment to diversity. There is a lack of effort and not to mention a strong bias towards diverse talent, which is troubling given the many talented individuals from different backgrounds who could bring valuable perspectives and experiences to the table. We have lost some fantastic people, including a great leader at the C-level. This is partly due to the company's failure to recognize and value the contributions of diverse employees.",

      "# [AI data development: a guide for data science projects by Matthew Casey on 2024-11-13](https://snorkel.ai/ai-data-development/)\nWhat is AI data development? AI data development includes any action taken to convert raw information into a format useful to AI.\n\nThis definition covers everything from the point of acquiring data to the point at which a data scientist exports a model for deployment. Many of these actions overlap with or bolster other data management techniques (such as tabularization and feature engineering, which may be useful for setting up databases and enabling downstream data analysis), but AI data development techniques focus on preparing data to train useful, deployable models.\n\nFor most of machine learning’s history, data scientists treated data as a static resource; it came pre-labeled by business or data collection processes. Data scientists mostly accepted the data as it was and iterated on model architectures and hyperparameters to build the best-performing application they could. This left teams constrained in what models they could build and how.\n\nData scientists have always engaged in some amount of data development. They normalize values, drop rows with missing data, and convert categorical columns into multiple boolean columns. The modern view of AI data development, which falls under the category of “data-centric AI” reframes how data scientists deal with data to include labeling and re-labeling data to improve model performance—often while keeping the base model or model architecture static.\n\nIn short, data development treats data like software—as a resource to iteratively change and improve to fit the project’s needs.\n\nIn this explainer, we will describe what AI data development is and why we think data science teams at every enterprise should embrace a wider definition of it.\n\nThe classical state of data\n\nEnterprise data science teams have classically worked with data created in one of the following ways:\n\nData automatically labeled by business processes. When a customer cancels their account, the database automatically labels that event.\n\nData labeled as a byproduct of the collection process. For example, data scientists could designate any column from U.S. Census Bureau table as a target value.\n\nData hand-labeled by subject matter experts (SMEs). Reserved for high-value applications, businesses sometimes pay to have experts meticulously label examples.\n\nRegardless of the labels’ source, classical labeling approaches limited how data scientists could use them. To build a model around something that’s not naturally tagged—for example, categorizing paragraphs in a contract—required a lot of work. Data teams would have to develop a labeling schema and guidelines for that schema, then recruit and manage human labelers to apply each label.\n\nProjects like these happened infrequently in the enterprise. This kind of labeling typically requires highly skilled (and expensive) annotators who don’t enjoy the labeling process.\n\nThe classical state of AI data development\n\nAI data development has existed longer than the title of data scientist. Whatever you call them, the technicians who extract insights from data have always done some or all of the following:\n\nRemove rows with missing data. Most data sets include some rows with missing data due to factors ranging from entry error to data corruption.\n\nIn-filling rows with missing data. Data scientists can use a variety of deterministic or probabilistic methods to fill cells that have been purged or left empty.\n\nManaging outliers. High-leverage outliers can significantly reduce model performance. Data scientists often identify and remove them.\n\nGenerating binary columns. Textual columns may include useful information that must be made numerical for the model to use it. Often this means building binary columns.\n\nFeature selection. Often, columns in a dataset mirror each other. Removing duplicate columns tends to improve performance.\n\nDeduplication. Data sets often include duplicate records. Leaving them in a model’s training set can distort performance.\n\nClass balancing. Many data science problems seek to identify low-frequency events. Rebalancing a data set to make the low-frequency events appear more frequent during training encourages models to pay more attention to them.\n\nAll of these approaches focus on structured data, but the core principles remain valid today. Data requires iteration and development to get the best possible performance out of a wide variety of models, whether that be a simple linear regression or something as complicated as fine-tuning Llama 3.1 405B.\n\nAI data development in the modern age\n\nEnterprise data scientists in the classical state of AI data development created tools and techniques to heighten the ability of models to learn from business data. But these data scientists had minimal input into what the original data looked like. Some forward-looking companies consulted data science teams on what data they should collect and how, but they were the exception.\n\nFor many years, this worked. Businesses had a wealth of high-value challenges they could solve with existing data sources. Now, data scientists increasingly face tasks that require looking beyond their company’s structured data.\n\nAs the challenges facing data scientists have increased in sophistication, so have the tools available to them; data scientists may now help shape labeling schemas and the way those labels get applied.\n\nAI data development with crowd labelers\n\nThe internet has long enabled crowd-labeling through forums and social media. Amazon Web Services formalized crowd-sourcing capabilities when it introduced its Mechanical Turk service in 2005. Since then, crowd-labeling enterprises, tools, and infrastructure have increased in sophistication and availability.\n\nNow, data science teams can craft the schemas they need to solve challenges important to their business and work with companies dedicated to crowd labeling. These firms help data science teams develop their schemas and labeling guidelines, distribute tasks among workers, overlay multiple workers’ chosen labels to reduce error rates, and help them iterate on their approach as difficulties arise.\n\nHowever, the scope of this approach remains limited for the following reasons:\n\nLack of specific expertise. Crowd-labeling platforms recruit labelers with knowledge of specific topics, but the highest-value models often require labels applied by highly specialized professionals. A crowd-labeling platform may provide workers with generalized medical knowledge, but few will have the training required to spot warning signs for lung cancer in electronic medical records.\n\nPrivacy. Businesses in highly regulated industries often cannot legally share their data with anyone. Other firms also have reasons to keep their data in-house—for example, their terms of service may promise to keep customer data private.\n\nRigidity. If a business needs to add or remove a label from its schema, crowd labelers must start again from zero.\n\nAI data development with subject matter experts\n\nTo develop novel data for a novel AI system, data scientists can simply ask experts to label the data. This approach has yielded some powerful and useful models—particularly in the medical field—but it often proves to be a non-starter.\n\nOrganizations have a limited number of experts capable of labeling records for high-value applications. Those experts typically work on tasks with obvious and immediate value. Data scientists who attempt to recruit experts to hand-label data can struggle to convince management that the model will be worth the experts’ time.\n\nAdditionally, while expert labeling solves the privacy and expertise challenges presented by crowd labelers, it does not solve the rigidity problem. Prior to working with Snorkel, one of Snorkel’s banking customers assigned in-house experts to classify contracts into eight categories. They cumulatively spent more than a month on the task before project leadership realized the model called for more than twenty classes—rendering the initial labeling spring worthless.\n\nAI data development with programmatic labeling\n\nProgrammatic labeling on the Snorkel Flow AI data development platform equips data science teams with scalable tools to amplify SMEs’ labeling impact.\n\nData scientists work with SMEs to create labeling functions that scale to cover the entire data set. In some cases, these functions apply simple rules, such as assigning the “employment” label to any contract that includes “employment” in the title. The framework, however, extends to cover powerful and complex tools such as checking external ontologies or querying large language models (LLMs)\n\nIn the abstract, this can look like a rule-based system, but programmatic labeling yields much more robust and flexible results.\n\nAfter composing a handful of labeling functions, the data scientist trains a quick, intermediate model to investigate the labels they’ve generated. They use analysis tools to see what labels in the verification set the model performs poorly on and how, and then develop new labeling functions to correct those errors.\n\nAs data scientists develop labeling functions, some will conflict, often deliberately. For example, imagine a spam-detection model that incorrectly flags legitimate emails from banks as suspect. The data scientist examines the error and concludes that it originates from a previous labeling function, which declared all emails that referred to wire transfers as spam.\n\nTo correct this issue, the data scientist creates another labeling function: all emails from verified bank email addresses should be labeled as “not spam.”\n\nThis cycle of examining shortcomings and instituting corrections continues until the quick model nears or exceeds the previously established deployment threshold. Then, the data scientist chooses an appropriate final model architecture, trains the model, and exports it for deployment.\n\nAI data development and GenAI\n\nLLMs can be a great help in programmatically labeling data. While far from perfect, off-the-shelf LLMs and cleverly crafted prompts can often build a solid baseline for categorical labeling functions. On Snorkel Flow, users frequently start a new project by building a labeling function that prompts an LLM for an initial set of labels that capture the application’s “low-hanging fruit.” Then, they work with experts to build additional labeling functions to correct where the LLM goes astray.\n\nData science teams charged with building specialized Generative AI (GenAI) models face a different set of challenges. Their toolbox includes many of the same operations required for traditional models, such as deduplication, removing outliers, and balancing classes. It also includes additional processes, such as data augmentation.\n\nRegardless of the specific process, the nature of the data required for GenAI complicates AI data development exercises.\n\nData filtering\n\nCurating the documents used to train generative models presents a meaningful challenge. A model trained on posts from internet cesspools will behave very differently from one trained on modern textbooks. Drawing the line between good and bad means making tricky choices, as does enforcing that line.\n\nEnsuring your training set has the right documents isn’t enough. Data scientists want the right balance of documents within the training set, and they want each document to appear only once; duplicated documents can distort GenAI models.\n\nFor a simple example, consider “Green Eggs & Ham.” The book has a place in the pre-training corpus of a large language model; its patterns and structure will help the model understand how to create content that sounds like children’s stories. Now imagine some accident caused duplicate copies of “Green Eggs & Ham” to make up 5% of the LLM’s pretraining corpus.\n\nThe resulting model might tend to generate unnecessarily repetitive responses and insist that both eggs and ham are green.\n\nAvoiding this problem requires scalable solutions. Humans can easily identify two duplicate images or documents, but the size of GenAI pre-training corpus (BloombergGPT used more than 700 billion pre-training tokens) puts this beyond the capability of human labelers—even a large crowd of them.\n\nInstead, data scientists use vectorizations, distance metrics, and clever mathematical shortcuts to spot documents that are too similar to coexist.\n\nCurating data for fine-tuning\n\nGenerative models require a second phase of training called fine-tuning. In this phase, the model learns how to follow instructions. Data scientists can use additional rounds of fine-tuning to reorient foundation models around their organizations’ targeted industry or tasks. Regardless, the quality of fine-tuning data meaningful impacts the performance of the final model.\n\nIn a demonstration of this, Snorkel researchers created an updated version of the open-source RedPajama model. The original model used Meta’s LLaMA architecture and a close approximation of the LLaMA pre-training corpus. The researchers did not have access to Meta’s fine-tuning corpus. In its place, they used two human-generated open-source data sets with about 20,000 prompt/response pairs between them.\n\nSnorkel’s researchers curated those 20,000 pairs down to the best 10,000 and rebalanced the data set to increase the share of prompts from previously under-represented classes. Then, they fine-tuned their version of the model. In a double-blind study, human testers preferred the new version in every category.\n\nThe Snorkel researchers could have used crowd labelers to classify prompts according to categories and responses as high or low quality. Instead, they used programmatic approaches and developed assistive models to label the corpus. Using Snorkel Flow, the process took the pair of researchers about a day. They spent more time verifying the impact of their curation efforts than they did performing them.\n\nClass balancing for GenAI\n\nClass balancing data for GenAI poses unique challenges. Not only do you want to include more examples of classes that are more important to your final use case (as you would with a traditional model), but you also want to de-emphasize classes on which the foundation model already performs well.\n\nThis assumes that data scientists have classes for their training documents, which they rarely will; by the nature of generative tasks, the training data generally comes unstructured.\n\nIn the RedPajama case study, our researchers built a model to classify prompt and response pairs into six categories according to those present in the Dolly 2.0 dataset. This approach effectively allowed the team to spread the Dolly labels onto records from the OpenAssistant dataset.\n\nData augmentation\n\nWhile data scientists sometimes use data augmentation for tabular data, the practice takes on increased importance when working with unstructured data, which can be difficult to source.\n\nFor a simple example, imagine a model aimed at identifying the faces of members of an elected body. After initial data collection and cleaning, the project’s engineers may only have half a dozen images of some officials—which is not enough to train a model. However, by stretching, skewing, cropping, flipping, and rotating the original images, data scientists can reach the training data threshold necessary to achieve reliable predictions.\n\nData augmentation can take several forms, but here are two examples:\n\nSynthetic text data. Snorkel worked with a client who wanted to build a generative model for use in end-user applications. However, the client promised in its terms of service not to use end-user data in model training. Snorkel engineers helped generate synthetic texts that mirrored real end-user data, enabling the client to train the model.\n\nRecontextualizing data. Engineers at Snorkel helped a client build re-contextualized images of products. This extended beyond the image augmentation described above to include images of the products in real-world situations—such as a synthetic image of a rug sold by the client dangling from a washing machine.\n\nThese data augmentation techniques help make the final model more robust.\n\nAI data development: the most efficient way to improve models\n\nAs enterprises and data scientists move onto new, higher-value challenges and into the realm of foundation models and GenAI, AI data development—and more aggressive AI data development—has become the most efficient way to improve model performance. While hyperparameter tuning and nudges to training processes remain important for cutting-edge research, AutoML approaches, and foundation model fine-tuning APIs have largely obviated them for practical application development.\n\nIn those realms, the only practical way to boost model performance is through higher-quality data at a model-appropriate scale.\n\nLearn More",
      "# [Snorkel AI dives into hot market of data curation by Diana Goovaerts on 2024-04-19](https://www.fierce-network.com/cloud/snorkel-ai-dives-hot-market-data-curation)\nEnterprises want specially trained AI models\n\nCompanies need data that is labeled to effectively fine tune AI\n\nPlayers like Snorkel AI are tackling this issue in the increasingly important data curation market\n\nIf you’re an enterprise looking to adopt generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), you probably want a model that’s been fine tuned to meet the needs of your specific vertical or – better still – your specific company. That specialized training requires data and lots of it. But how do you know which files in your vast trove of storage are the right ones to train the model to do what you want it to?\n\nEnter data curation.\n\nCompanies like Snorkel AI, Snowflake, Databricks, Appen, Scale AI and LabelBox are all staking a claim in what is poised to become a very important market.\n\n“This is a hot area, an important area,” AvidThink’s Roy Chua told Fierce.\n\n“All of it comes down to how do you manage the ModelOps problem and also the DataOps or MLOps, which is how do you clean the data, how do you prepare the data, how do you manage data for AI and machine learning in general.”\n\nZooming in\n\nFor its part, Snorkel is solving the data curation problem with software. Co-founder Paroma Varma told Fierce the idea is to transform what is mostly a tedious manual process today and transform it into something that can be done programmatically.\n\nThe way it works is that Snorkel takes domain knowledge from subject matter experts and encodes that into a series of rules. The software – known as Snorkel Flow – then uses an algorithm to decide which rule should be applied to the data to categorize it. Once all the data is labeled, it is then fed into a model. The model’s responses are then checked for errors, and if any are discovered Snorkel can trace the source of the problem and correct it.\n\n“I think anyone who’s working with AI today needs to develop their data,” Varma said. “If you use your model out of the box what we’re seeing is for these specialized enterprise use cases, these models rarely work. They’ll give you accuracies in the 30%, 20% range, just not ready for production yet. And then the only lever is your data, so you want to be able to develop it fast…so that you can continue your AI development process.”\n\nSnorkel, she said, can condense the data development process from something like six months down to a few hours. And, Varma added, AI deployments aren’t a one and done process. The data used to train the models constantly needs to be updated so that it continues to meet business objectives. If there’s an error or a blind spot, enterprises don’t want that to take a year to fix.\n\nEarlier this month, Snorkel released its second product – Snorkel Custom – which offers customers the chance to partner with the company’s researchers and engineers to build LLM pipelines. In a nutshell, Snorkel is taking and owning the end-to-end approach with Snorkel Custom rather than leaving the last bit to enterprises.\n\nVarma said Snorkel AI’s technology was originally developed as a project in the Stanford AI lab in 2015. It later became its own company in 2019. To date, Snorkel has raised more than $135 million and as of 2021 had a valuation of $1 billion.\n\nDiving into the future\n\nChua said he expects Snorkel will soon “get snapped up by someone,” be that a hyperscaler or even a competitor. The caveat is that it first needs to demonstrate that it is gaining traction in the market, he said. But Snorkel already has.\n\nVarma told Fierce that Snorkel is working with many Fortune 500 companies and seven of the top 10 U.S. banks. It also has customers in the healthcare, e-commerce (hello again, Wayfair!) and insurance verticals.\n\nEarlier this year, the investment arm of insurance Group QBE said it invested an undisclosed sum in the company. QBE said at the time that its North American division has been using Snorkel Flow to aid predictive analytics.",
      "# [Walkthrough for annotators](https://docs.snorkel.ai/docs/0.94/user-guide/annotation/walkthrough-for-annotators)\nThis page walks through the process of manually annotating documents in Annotation Studio. This walkthrough is designed for users with the Annotator role, who need to access Snorkel Flow to annotate the documents that are assigned to them. Below, you'll find an interactive demo showing how to annotate your data.\n\nThe instructions below further outline what you saw in the interactive demo.\n\nAfter you log in to Snorkel Flow, you need to access your batches to start annotating. Batches are a collection of documents that are assigned to you to manually annotate. A batch is typically a subset of the total documents. With Snorkel Flow, the number of documents that need to be manually annotated is significantly smaller.\n\nTo access your batches, click My work on the left-side menu.\n\nThe My work page shows a list of batches for you to annotate:\n\nThe following information about each batch is available:\n\nBatch: The name of the batch.\n\nStatus: Specifies whether annotations on the batch have not be started, are in progress, or have been completed.\n\nAnnotators: The list of annotators that have been assigned to annotate the batch.\n\nAnnotated: The number of documents in the batch that have been annotated.\n\nSize: The total number of documents that are in the batch.\n\nCreated: The date that the batch was created.\n\nNow, you can start annotating your documents!\n\nOnce you click Annotate, your screen will look similar to the image below:\n\nThe main canvas shows the document text. For classification and extraction applications, the right side-pane shows all classes that you can label the document.\n\nHere is some information about the various buttons that you can see on your screen:\n\nClick Data view (or Document view for extraction applications) to change the appearance of the documents in the main canvas. The views that are available differ based on the application type.\n\nClick the Filter icon to filter the documents that are shown to you. For example, you can use the filter to just show the documents that have comments on them.\n\nClick the gear icon to adjust various settings. We recommend that you adjust a few settings before you get started annotating.\n\nClick the arrow icons to page through the documents.\n\nClick the tag icon to add tags to the document. For example, you can tag documents that you find confusing and want to bring up for discussion.\n\nClick the comment icon to add comments to the document. For example, you can write a comment to explain your reasoning behind a selecting a particular label.\n\nAfter accessing your documents, we recommend that you first adjust some settings to get some quality of life improvements while annotating! To change your settings, click the gear icon at the top-right corner of your screen. We recommend changing the following settings:\n\nSelect display columns: This setting lets you select and display only the data columns that are necessary for marking your annotations (e.g., the text column). This removes clutter from the main canvas when you are reviewing documents.\n\nAuto-advance on label change: With this setting enabled, after you label a document, you automatically go to the next document. This prevents you from having to manually click the arrow icons to page through the documents every time to view new, unlabeled documents. This setting is only available for single-label and text extraction applications.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts: With this setting enabled, keys are assigned to each label class, which makes it quicker to assign a label. In the example below, if you want to label a document \"employment,\" then you just have to press 0 on your keyboard.\n\nHere are descriptions of the rest of the settings that are available when you click the gear icon:\n\nMark spaces (·): Replaces all spaces in your document with a dot (·).\n\nHyperlink URLs: Hyperlinks any URL in your document. This makes it easier to see links in your documents and allows you to click the hyperlink to go directly to the website.\n\nRight-to-left (RTL) text: Right justifies your document text. By default, the document text is left justified.\n\nGo to first unlabeled data: Brings you to the first document in the batch that has not yet been annotated. This option is helpful any time you re-enter a batch to continue annotating.\n\nExport Studio dataset: Export your dataset into a CSV file.\n\nThe following sections walk through how to annotate documents for the four different task types:\n\nsingle-label classification\n\nmulti-label classification\n\ntext extraction\n\nsequence tagging\n\nIn single-label classification applications, your goal is to assign a single class to each document. For example, assigning banking contract documents to one of the following classes: \"employment,\" \"loan,\" \"services,\" or \"stock.\" For more information about this setting, see Set the default label for multi-label annotation applications.\n\nOn the right-side pane, you'll see all possible classes that you can label your document. To label a document, click the class in the right-side menu. Then click the arrow button to move on to the next document. If you adjusted the recommended settings, then you use can use the keyboard shortcut to assign a class, and then you will automatically be brought to the next document.\n\nIn multi-label classification applications, individual documents can have multiple label values. For example, let's say you are looking at movie review documents. You can label the movie as \"Short Film,\" \"Black and White,\" \"Japanese Movies,\" or \"World Cinema.\" Given these labels, you can see that a single movie can fall into multiple categories. In this case, for a given document, you can label each possible class as present, absent, or abstain from voting.\n\nOn the right-side pane, you'll see all possible classes. For each class, you can click:\n\nto label the class as Abstain.\n\nto label the class as Present.\n\nto label the class as Absent.\n\nBy default, all classes are initially labeled as Abstain. If enabled for your application, you can set the default label for each class to either Present, Absent, or Abstain.\n\nYou can also sort the classes, which is particularly helpful for applications with a large number of classes. You can sort classes marked as Present first, classes marked as Absent first, or in Alphanumerical order.\n\nIn multi-label classification applications, individual documents can have multiple label values. For a given document, you can label each possible class as present, absent, or abstain from voting. From the Overview page, you have the option to set the default label value for your application. This is helpful in situations where different teams in your organization want their default label to be different based on their particular use case. In addition, this setting is application specific so it will only affect your current working application.\n\nFollow the steps below to set up your default label:\n\nClick the gear icon in the top right corner of your screen.\n\nIn modal, select a default label of Present, Absent, or Abstain from the dropdown.\n\nClick the Save button to save your changes.\n\nOpen a batch and then you'll see that for unlabeled documents, the default label is set as your selection.\n\nYou can now take one of the following actions when reviewing a document:\n\na. You can select labels however you like.\n\nb. You can go with the default labels by clicking the Confirm defaults button.\n\nYou can see the progress has gone up after you've completed either of the actions listed above and the state has changed to Labeled.\n\nIf you want to revert your changes and go back to the unlabeled state, click Labeled. The modal asks for your confirmation as this action cannot be undone.\n\nAfter you confirm, the document returns to an unlabeled state. You'll also see the Confirm defaults button again along with the default labels and progress.\n\nIn text extraction applications, the goal is to extract key information from a document. For example, let's say that we want to extract all dates from a document. In this case, a date is considered a span. Your goal in this example is to review all highlighted spans in a document and identify whether the highlighted spans are in fact dates. You can label each highlighted span as \"NEGATIVE,\" \"POSITIVE,\" or \"UNKNOWN\" in the right-side pane. In this example, \"POSITIVE\" means that the highlighted span is a date, and \"NEGATIVE\" means that the highlighted span is not a date.\n\nIf you adjusted the recommended settings, then you can use the keyboard shortcuts to label a span, and then automatically to be brought to the next highlighted span in the document.\n\nBy default, you will be viewing the spans in Document view. We recommend annotating in either Document view or Span view:\n\nDocument view shows the entire document on the main canvas. You can use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to navigate between spans of text to annotate. This view provides you with all context surrounding a span.\n\nSpan view shows a single span per page. With this view, you don't have all the context surrounding a span. However, the simplified view can enable you to more quickly annotate things like dates that are easy to identify with less context.\n\nIn sequence tagging applications, your goal is to highlight and label spans throughout a document. Spans are key pieces of information that you want to extract from a document. For example, let's say we want to identify all mentions of company names in a document. In this case, a company name is considered a span. Your goal is then to highlight and label all company names that you find while reading through the document.\n\nTo label spans in Annotation Studio:\n\nHighlight a span.\n\nSelect the label that you want for that span in the Annotation modal.\n\nIf you don't find any spans to label in the document, you can indicate this by clicking the Label entire document as OTHER button above the document text.\n\nAt any point, you can reset and clear all spans that you have labeled in the document by clicking the Remove all labels from document button above the document text.\n\nWhile you are annotating documents, you can see your progress percentage tick up in the right-hand corner of your screen.\n\nOnce you are finished, your progress bar will be labeled 100%, and the status will be updated to Complete on the Batches page.\n\nOccasionally a reviewer will leave comments on documents. For example, if you left a comment asking a clarifying question, a reviewer may respond to your comment. To see all documents with comments:\n\nClick the filter icon.\n\nClick Comments.\n\nUnder User, select the person that you want to see comments from. Alternatively, you can select Any user.\n\nClick the checkmark to save the filter.\n\nNow, just the documents with comments are shown, making it easier for you to review any comments.\n\nYou can follow similar steps to filter documents based on tags:",
      "# [Snorkel Flow update makes it easier to use enterprise data with Llama 3, Gemini AI by Carl Franzen, www.facebook.com on 2024-04-24](https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/snorkel-flow-update-makes-it-easier-to-use-your-enterprise-data-with-llama-3-gemini-ai/)\nSnorkel AI, a four-year-old startup that grew out of the Stanford AI Lab has announced a major update to its signature product — a data labeling, filtering, curation and AI fine-tuning platform called Snorkel Flow, which will now be able to integrate directly with Google’s Gemini AI model family and Meta’s brand new Llama 3.\n\nSnorkel Flow was initially launched in March 2022 with the aim to drastically improve the process by which enterprises develop and deploy custom AI solutions, letting them take their data — whether it’s structured or unstructured documents — and help them automatically label, annotate, and organize it to make it useful as a source of truth and information for their AI apps and services.\n\n“Enterprises are hitting a wall in terms of what they’re able to accomplish with off-the-shelf LLMs that have been trained on the public internet for general purpose usage,” said Alex Ratner, co-founder and CEO of Snorkel AI, in a video call interview with VentureBeat conducted yesterday ahead of the announcement. “They haven’t been customized for [enterprises’] use cases, their data sets, their settings. That’s where we come in with our platform Snorkel Flow for doing data labeling, data development, and doing it radically more efficiently.”\n\nFor example, if your company wanted to build a chatbot for employees that answered their questions about internal policies and company holidays, Snorkel Flow could ensure those documents were labeled appropriately so the chatbot could find them and extract the relevant information when asked. Or, if you wanted to create a customer service chatbot that understood when a customer mentioned a specific product name, Snorkel Flow could help you tune the model to understand that name referred to a specific SKU.\n\nAccording to Ratner, the company’s specialty is “AI data development,” which includes “all of the labeling, but also the curation, picking the right data, filtering for high quality data, choosing the right mix of data, maybe augmenting it with synthetic data, all of that data development that gets a finely curated data set to actually tune [AI] models on.”\n\n“All the platform vendors, the cloud vendors, are announcing APIs for tuning models, but they don’t help you with actually getting the data ready to dump into that API, which is the entire hard part,” Ratner added.\n\nAt the time it launched, Snorkel Flow included features such as programmatic data labeling and collaborative AI development, which were adopted by major enterprises such as Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Chubb to improve AI model accuracy and development efficiency by 10 to 100 times, according to Snorkel. Seven of the top 10 U.S. banks are reportedly customers of the company, and Ratner said they were able to help some of them automatically label data for compliance with regulations reducing time spent on manual labeling from “six months to 24 hours.”\n\n“As base LLMs become pervasive, including powerful open-source options like Llama 3, the speed and accuracy with which data is continuously labeled and curated for fine-tuning and aligning LLMs becomes the key differentiator,” Ratner added in a press release sent to VentureBeat.\n\nA brand new Flow\n\nIn addition to allowing users to tap their enterprise data — organized and labeled by Snorkel’s AI — as a source of truth and information through tuned versions of Google Gemini and Llama 3, the Snorkel Flow platform received a boatload of additional upgrades today.\n\nIt will now integrates with Databricks Unity Catalog, Vertex AI, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, platforms that enterprises may already be using or wish to use to help them organize and control access to their data.\n\nMoreover, Snorkel Flow now supports programmatic labeling of multimodal data including images.\n\nThis is particularly timely, as enterprises are increasingly looking to leverage AI across various data modalities to gain more comprehensive insights and enhance decision-making processes.\n\nOne Snorkel customer that has already taken advantage of the image data labeling functionality is Wayfair, and Ratner said the goal was to provide the same “speed up” in labeling as with text documents, going from months or weeks to days or hours.\n\nMore secure Snorkel\n\nSnorkel has added new role-based access controls (RBAC) for Snorkel Flow account administrators, letting them control access to an enterprise’s data and where it can be used and accessed for AI development and responses.\n\nThe new RBAC features also enable administrators to control who can even upload data to an enterprise’s Snorkel Flow development account in the first place, and regulate access to any connected services or apps.\n\nThis is similar in some ways to the new Projects feature unveiled by OpenAI yesterday for its proprietary in-house models — but of course, Snorkel allows for enterprises to control access to multiple models from multiple vendors.\n\nAdditionally, Snorkel Flow now supports on-premise and air-gapped access to foundation models, allowing for greater compliance and data security.\n\nThis release also complements Snorkel’s recently launched enterprise AI accelerator, Snorkel Custom, which provides structured engagements to support enterprises from the initial evaluation phase through the tuning and optimization of AI models.\n\nFrom flashy demo to production value added\n\nIn general, Snorkel is aiming to help its enterprise customers realize the potential of generative AI by making their data as useful as possible, as fast as possible for fine-tuning AI models to their specific needs and use cases, as well as building AI-powered applications and services — ideally atop fine-tuned models.\n\n“It’s a pretty broad trend that we’re seeing,” Ratner told VentureBeat. “People had massive pressure to get some kind of [AI] demo out. The demo looked really good. Expectations were sky high, even compared to most hype cycles and just in tech history. And now there’s massive pressure to cross that chasm from flashy chat bot demo to production value.”\n\nSnorkel Flow and Snorkel Custom are now generally available, with pricing dependent on the specific use case.",
      "# [Key concepts](https://docs.snorkel.ai/docs/0.93/user-guide/overview/key-concepts/)\nThis page lists terminology used throughout the user guide and the Snorkel Flow interface.\n\nA dataset refers to the collection of data records you want to work with. It contains data sources assigned to relevant splits.\n\nA data source refers to a file that will be loaded into a specific data split in a dataset. Snorkel Flow currently supports CSV and Parquet formats. Each data source requires an index field that specifies a unique index for each row of the data. The indices must be unique across all splits within a dataset.\n\nAn application refers to a specific machine learning problem that you want to solve using Snorkel Flow. Implemented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) over operators, an application can be used to compose complex data flow pipelines from simpler building blocks. Applications can be visualized and manipulated in Application Studio or the Python SDK.\n\nCurrently, Snorkel Flow supports the following application templates:\n\nClassification: Classify datapoints as one of many labels.\n\nDate Extraction: Extract specific types of dates from documents.\n\nEmail Address Extraction: Extract email addresses from documents.\n\nhOCR Extraction: Extract structured information using hocr data (i.e. from pdfs).\n\nMulti-label Classification: Tag datapoints with zero, one, or more non-exclusive labels.\n\nMulti-label PDF Classification: Classify PDF documents with zero, one, or more non-exclusive labels.\n\nNative PDF Extraction: Extract structured information from Native PDFs.\n\nPDF Classification: Classify PDF documents as one of many labels.\n\nSequence Tagging: Classify tokens of documents as one of many labels.\n\nText Entity Classification: Extract entities, link them to canonical entities, and classify those entities.\n\nText Extraction: Extract entities by first identifying high-recall candidate spans and then classifying each as the target entity or not.\n\nUS Currency Extraction: Extract specific US dollar amounts from documents.\n\nA block is a convenient way to group operators that perform some key functionality (e.g. span extraction). They can be instantiated using Application templates, and it’s possible to chain multiple blocks together in a single application.\n\nSnorkel Flow Operators are functions that define transformations over dataframes. For instance, they may be used to clean data, extract candidate spans from documents, or group by and reduce predicted spans by document. Operators may be implemented as heuristics or learned models, whatever is most practical for your application. For advanced usage, the Python SDK also exposes utilities to register custom operators.\n\nSee Operators: Transform and process your data for more information.\n\nSnorkel Flow supports the following 4 data splits: train, dev, valid, test. All of them, except dev, can be uploaded by users. The dev split will be sampled from the train split.\n\nTrain: The partially labeled or unlabeled data to which Snorkel Flow will assign labels. It should represent the largest proportion of the dataset.\n\nDev: A subset of the train split is randomly sampled to create a dev split, which will be used for guiding the development of LFs and models.\n\nBy default, 10% of the train split, up to 10,000 samples, will be used for the dev split.\n\nGround truth labels for this split are optional and can be specified during data loading or annotated within Snorkel Flow.\n\nSnorkel Flow does not require the dev split to have GTs to generate labels for the train split.\n\nValid: The split used for tuning the hyperparameters of machine learning models. It requires labels, but can be labeled within Snorkel Flow.\n\nTest: The split used for evaluating models’ performance. It requires labels, but can be labeled within Snorkel Flow.\n\nThe key data programming abstraction in Snorkel, a labeling function (LF) is a programmatic rule or heuristic that assigns labels to unlabeled data. Each LF works on one class: to vote whether a data point has a certain label.\n\nSnorkel's core label model is responsible for estimating LF accuracies and aggregating them into training labels without relying on ground truth labels.\n\nSee the Labeling function builders index page for a full list of LFs that can be created in Snorkel Flow.\n\nA label package is created from a set of labeling functions. Snorkel Flow's core engine will combine, de-noise, and reweigh the outputs of each labeling function to generate labels for your data. You can create a label package in the Label page and see the available label packages in the LF Packages page.\n\nThree main label spaces are used for data representation, which you might come across while using Snorkel. They are multi label, sequence label, and single label spaces.\n\nSingle label - one data point can belong to only one class.\n\nMulti label - one data point can belong to multiple classes.\n\nSequence label - A datapoint in seq tagging is a document, which contains/consists of multiple spans, and each span can only have one class.\n\nExample: You are being offered employment at Some Company and you start on September 1st, 2022.\n\nDifferent label spaces can be used to perform specific operations on the above example. Here are some ways each of them could be used on the text:\n\nSingle label spaces can be used to find the company name in the pre-extracted/pre-determined span Single label spaces can also be used to label at the document level.\n\nSome Company -> company name label\n\nMulti label spaces can be used to label at the document level. Example: determine the category of a document.\n\nSome Company -> employment contract and personal email labels\n\nSequence label spaces can be used to detect spans in the text using character offsets, for example, dates or company names.\n\nA span is characterized by its character offsets (char_start, char_end)in the text, and each span is associated with a single label. (0, 8, ‘OTHER’) denotes a span starting at index 0, and ending at 8 belongs to OTHER class.\n\n(0, 8, \"OTHER\") corresponds to: You are -> OTHER label (8, 36, \"OTHER\") corresponds to: being offered employment at -> OTHER label (36, 47, \"COMPANY\") corresponds to: Some Company -> COMPANY label (48, 65, \"OTHER \") corresponds to: and you start on -> OTHER label (66, 86, \"DATE\") corresponds to: September 1st, 2022 -> DATE label\n\nEach application template is exclusive to one label space. When you’re working with a specific template, you can expect the GT formats to align with the label space associated with the application template.\n\nAll application templates that specify Multi label in their naming conventions use multi label as the label space. These are Multi-label Classification and Multi-label PDF Classification.\n\nAll Information Extraction tasks (applications that have the Information Extraction label on the application template cards) use single label spaces. These are US Currency Extraction, Native PDF Extraction, hOCR Extraction, Date Extraction, Email Address Extraction, and Text Extraction.\n\nSequence Tagging is the only application that uses sequence label spaces.\n\nAll other application templates also use single label spaces. These are PDF Classification and plain Classification, Utterance and Conversation Classification, and Text Entity Classification.\n\nIn this section we’ll show example formats for each label space for usage in our SDK for a given datapoint.\n\nMulti-label spaces ground truth is represented as a dictionary where there is a mapping from each label to one of PRESENT, ABSENT, or ABSTAIN:\n\nSequence tagging ground truth for a document is a list of spans, where each span is a triple of (char_start, char_end, label). The spans cannot be empty (char_start must be smaller than char_end). Overlapping or duplicating spans are not allowed. The sets of char offsets (char_start, char_end) must be sorted:\n\nSingle label space ground truth format is represented by their class label\n\nA training set is a set of labels generated by a label package for a certain split, e.g. the train split. You can create a training set from existing label packages in the LF Packages page and use the resulting labels to train a downstream machine learning model via the Python SDK or the Train page.\n\nSpans of texts extracted from the original document that the labeling functions and models operate over. For example, if your application extracts the focal entity of an article, then candidate spans are entities extracted from that article, and you will train a model to predict whether each span is the focal entity or not.\n\nCandidate/Span concept is relevant for information extraction and entity classification applications.\n\nMachine learning uses collected experience and data to improve a system’s performance. In many tasks, this experience is gained by doing experiments or making queries to the user. This treats the learner (ML model) as a passive recipient of data.\n\nActive learning, on the other hand, is the study on how to use the learner’s ability to gather data and act on the experience it receives.\n\nEntropy is the measure of distance from how close the predicted distribution is to a uniform distribution. A uniform distribution is when each predicted label is equally likely. For example, the entropy of a model where it thinks that each outcome is equally likely (each label could happen at X percent) would be 1.",

      "# [Products, Competitors, Financials, Employees, Headquarters Locations](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/snorkelai)\nThe DeepSeek Moment\n\nThe DeepSeek Moment In the rapidly evolving world of AI, the arrival of DeepSeek-R1 marks a pivotal shift. We reached out to founders of five leading AI infrastructure companies in Greylock’s portfolio—Devvret Rishi (Predibase), Tuhin Srivastava (Baseten), Ankur Goyal (Braintrust), Jerry Liu (LlamaIndex), and Alex Ratner (Snorkel AI)—to get their take on DeepSeek and what it means for the future of open-source vs. closed models, AI infrastructure, and GenAI economics. Their insights reveal broad enthusiasm about the advancements DeepSeek brings, with some divergence in perspectives on its real-world impact. Open-Source vs. Closed Models: The Playing Field Has Leveled Historically, proprietary models like OpenAI’s were significantly ahead of open-source alternatives, often by 6-12 months. DeepSeek-R1 has fundamentally closed that gap, demonstrating performance on par with OpenAI’s latest offerings on key reasoning benchmarks, despite its smaller footprint. According to Rishi, “DeepSeek-R1 is a watershed moment for open-source AI. Historically, open-source models trailed proprietary models like OpenAI’s by 6-12 months. Now, DeepSeek-R1 has essentially closed that gap and is on par with OpenAI’s latest models on key reasoning benchmarks despite its smaller footprint.” He believes this is the inflection point where open-source begins to commoditize the model layer. Srivastava echoes this sentiment, stating, “DeepSeek as a moment changes everything. An open-source model is at the same level of quality as the SOTA closed-source models, which previously was not the case. Now with the cat out of the bag, all of the open-source models like Llama, Qwen, and Mistral will be soon to follow.” Goyal offers a more balanced perspective: “DeepSeek is the ‘LLaMa moment’ for O1-style (reasoning) models. In the very worst case, it means that the secret formula is out, and we’ll have a vibrant and competitive LLM market just like we did for GPT, Claude, and LLaMa-style models. In the best case, engineering teams will have a huge diversity of practical options, each with compute, cost, and performance trade-offs that enable them to solve a very wide variety of problems. In all cases, I think the world benefits from this progress.” Ratner echoes the above sentiments about open source and model diversity, focusing on the massive acceleration to enterprises specializing their own AI that this represents: “We’ve always viewed open source models as right behind- algorithms and model architectures rarely stay hidden for long. It was only a matter of time. However: it punctuates the exciting reality that enterprises will have a plethora of performant and cheap LLM options to then evaluate and specialize with their data and expertise, for their unique use cases. I expect DeepSeek to accelerate this trend of specialized enterprise AI massively.” AI Infrastructure and Developer Adoption: The Reinforcement Learning Revolution One of the most striking aspects of DeepSeek-R1 is its use of reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities. While RL-based LLM optimization has been explored for years, DeepSeek is the first open-source model to successfully implement it at scale with measurable gains, using a technique called Generalized Reinforcement Learning with Policy Optimization (GRPO). Rishi sees this as a game-changer, explaining, “DeepSeek’s most impactful contribution is proving that pure reinforcement learning can bootstrap advanced reasoning capabilities, as seen with their R1-Zero model.” However, he also notes a major gap: “Most ML teams have never trained reasoning models, and today’s AI tooling isn’t built to support this new paradigm.” Srivastava believes that DeepSeek marks an inflection point for AI infrastructure: “With DeepSeek, the moat of ‘we trained the biggest and best model, so we’re keeping it closed’ is gone. Now, you have a situation where frontier model-level quality is available in a model you completely control.” Ratner adds, “We are seeing the ‘AlphaGo moment’ for constrained, verifiable domains (e.g. math, basic coding- things that are simple and well defined to check for correctness), showing the power of LLMs + RL, and the rapid diffusion of algorithmic advancements.” However, he stresses that the next steps will involve expanding this success to more complex and less verifiable domains—a much longer and more challenging journey, involving much more human ingenuity and input. New Applications: AI Reasoning at Scale DeepSeek’s improved reasoning capabilities unlock a new wave of applications. Rishi highlights several emerging possibilities, including: Autonomous AI agents that refine their decision-making over time. Highly specialized planning systems in industries like finance, logistics, and healthcare. Enterprise AI assistants that dynamically adapt to user needs beyond rigid RAG-based solutions. AI-powered software engineering tools that can self-debug and optimize code based on performance feedback. Liu expands on this by discussing the implications for GPU demand and agentic applications: “DeepSeek does not mean that there will be less demand for GPU compute; on the contrary, I’m quite excited because I think it will significantly accelerate the demand and adoption of agentic applications. One of the core issues with building any agent that ‘actually works’ is reliability, speed, and cost—robust agent applications that can e2e automate knowledge workflows require reasoning loops that repeatedly make LLM inference calls. The more general/capable the agent is, the more reasoning loops it requires. While the O1/O3 series of models have impressive reasoning capabilities, they are way too cost prohibitive to use for more general agents. Faster/cheaper models incentivize the development of more general agents that can solve more tasks, which in turn leads to greater demand and adoption across more people and teams.” Srivastava emphasizes, “There are big implications from DeepSeek and the subsequent models that will follow for highly regulated industries. Companies that have strict data compliance requirements will be able to more freely experiment and innovate knowing that they can completely control how data is used and where it’s sent.” Ratner underscores that data remains the real edge: “R1-style progress relies on strong pre/post-training in the relevant domains and rigorous evaluation data before the RL magic kicks in.” He further explains, “Many things in GenAI today effectively reduce to really high-quality, domain-specific labeling, including reinforcement learning. DeepSeek’s results reiterate the point that if you have a good way to label (i.e. a “reward function”), you can do magic; but in most domains, it’s not so easy to get the data or label it.” Economics of GenAI: The Cost Equation Changes DeepSeek accelerates the trend toward cheaper, more efficient inference and post-training, significantly altering the economics of GenAI deployment. Rishi points to Jevon’s Paradox: “As LLMs become cheaper and more efficient, enterprises won’t just replace proprietary APIs with open-source models—they’ll use AI even more, fine-tuning and deploying multiple domain-specific models instead of relying on a single general-purpose one.” Srivastava emphasizes the financial impact, stating, “A reasoning model like R1 will be as much as 7x cheaper than using an OpenAI or Anthropic. Having a model with those economics unlocks many use cases that previously may not have been financially viable or attractive for most enterprises, which are yet to come meaningfully online with Gen AI. Ratner adds, “As the generators become more powerful and commoditized—it’s all about labeling! Whether it’s RLHF, heuristic methods like DeepSeek-R1’s reward functions, or advanced hybrid approaches, defining the acceptance function to match the distribution we want is the logical next step.” DeepSeek is undeniably a milestone in the AI industry, marking the first time an open-source model has reached true competitive parity with proprietary alternatives. Rishi and Srivastava see it as a fundamental shift, ushering in a new era of AI development where companies can fully control high-performing models while benefiting from the economic advantages of open-source. Goyal, however, remains skeptical of its real-world adoption so far, viewing it more as a pricing lever against incumbents than an immediate replacement. Ratner reinforces that while DeepSeek represents meaningful progress, much of the future of AI hinges on high-quality, domain-specific data and labeling. He concludes, “Whether you see it as a paradigm shift or just another step in the AI arms race, its impact on the industry is undeniable.” From Idea to Iconic.",
