      "# [Snorkel Brand System](https://brand.snorkel.ai/)\nLogos & wordmark\n\nOur wordmark, lockup and Dr. Bubbles mascot play distinct roles in how the Snorkel brand is expressed. On this page you will find the most commonly used variations, notes on usage, and files for download.\n\nDownload logo\n\nSnorkel Wordmark\n\nThe Snorkel wordmark is our primary logo, and should be your go-to for most use cases.\n\nThe wordmark is based on a modified version of the DIN typeface, with custom ascenders and ligatures.\n\nColor variations\n\nThe wordmark comes in two versions, for use against either light or dark backgrounds. Please ensure that the wordmark always has enough contrast to stand out, and avoid placing it on patterned or detailed background imagery.\n\nDownload here\n\nMinimum sizing\n\nPlease check that our logo is at least 80 pixels wide for digital, or 16mm wide for print applications to ensure legibility.\n\nClearance\n\nOur wordmark needs room to breathe and should not be crowded out by other content. This is particularly important when used with other logos.\n\nPlease allow for a minimum space of the x-height (the height of lower case letters) around the wordmark.\n\nMisuse\n\nIn most cases you should follow this one golden rule and you won’t have to worry about irate designers protesting outside your house:\n\nDon’t change the wordmark in any way - no stretching, no effects, don’t change the colors and don’t try to recreate it in any way.\n\nJust for emphasis, here are a few examples of how not to use the wordmark:\n\nDon’t recolor the logo\n\nDon’t use the wrong version on your background\n\nDon’t rotate the logo\n\nDon’t stretch or distort the logo\n\nDon’t reproduce the logo using our brand font\n\nDon’t reproduce our logo using any other font\n\nDon’t use the logo over detailed or densely patterned backgrounds\n\nDon’t cover up faces or image focal points\n\nMascot (Dr. Bubbles)\n\nMeet Dr. Bubbles, our loveable mascot representing the playful side of the Snorkel brand.\n\nWhile Dr. Bubbles' charm can endear it to audiences, it should only be used in a context where the Snorkel brand is clearly established, never standalone.\n\nColor variations\n\nDr. Bubbles comes in three versions, a full color version and monochrome versions for use against either light or dark backgrounds. Please ensure that the logo always has enough contrast to stand out, and avoid placing it on patterned or detailed background imagery.\n\nDownload here\n\nPlease note:\n\nUnlike the Snorkel wordmark, Dr. Bubbles has key design differences depending on the background they are being used on. Please note that a dark background version cannot ever be recolored to work on a light background (and vice versa) as the designs are different.\n\nFull color\n\nMonochrome (dark background)\n\nMonochrome (light background)\n\nUsage\n\nAs with our wordmark, in most cases you should follow this one golden rule and you won’t have to worry about irate designers protesting outside your house:\n\nDon’t change the logo in any way - no stretching, no effects, don’t change the colors and don’t try to train an octopus to wear a snorkel (please, they hate that)\n\nJust for emphasis, here are a few examples of how not to use the logo:\n\nDon’t recolor any part of Dr. Bubbles\n\nDon’t ever invert Dr. Bubbles to fit your background\n\nDon’t use Dr. Bubbles standalone, make sure the context is clearly Snorkel related\n\nDon’t stretch or deform Dr. Bubbles in any way\n\nDon’t use monochrome Dr. Bubbles on detailed or densely patterned backgrounds\n\nDon’t use the color version of Dr. Bubbles on a dark background.\n\nSnorkel Lockups\n\nThere are two versions of the Snorkel lockup combining the Dr Bubbles mascot with the Snorkel wordmark - a horizontal and a vertical layout.\n\nThe lockups should only be used on those occasions where the wordmark on its own might be a little sterile or you want to show off Dr. Bubbles - a conference stand graphic or swag would be good use cases.\n\nColor variations\n\nThe Snorkel lockup comes in four color variations, two full color versions and two monochrome versions for use against either light or dark backgrounds. The ‘Full color alt’ version is intended for use where a darker background makes the wordmark less legible.\n\nPlease ensure that the logo always has enough contrast to stand out, and avoid placing it on patterned or detailed background imagery.\n\nDownload here\n\nPlease note:\n\nAs shown above, the Dr. Bubbles part of the lockup has key design differences depending on the background they are being used on.\n\nPlease note that a dark background version cannot ever be recolored to work on a light background (and vice versa) as the designs are different.\n\nMinimum sizing\n\nPlease check that our lockup is at least 120 pixels wide for digital, or 24mm wide for print applications to ensure legibility.\n\nClearance\n\nAs with our wordmark, our lockup needs room to breathe and should not be crowded out by other content. This is particularly important when used with other logos.\n\nPlease allow for a minimum space of the x-height (the height of lower case letters) around the outer edges of the lockup.\n\nMisuse\n\nIn most cases you should follow this one golden rule and you won’t have to worry about angry designers camping outside your house:\n\nDon’t change the lockup in any way - no stretching, no effects, don’t change the colors and don’t do anything weird with it\n\nJust for emphasis, here are a few examples of how not to use the lockup:\n\nDon’t change the size of any elements\n\nDon’t change any colors\n\nDon’t rotate the lockup or any elements within\n\nDon’t use the ‘Full color alt’version of Dr. Bubbles on a dark background.\n\nOutdated logos\n\nA common issue with Snorkel being mentioned in press releases and even some internal messaging, is that we are seing the outdated ‘Snorkel’ research project logo being used to represent Snorkel AI.\n\nPlease help us identify and correct this incorrect usage wherever you see it.\n\nBelow are some tips to help identify outdated logos.\n\nKey differences\n\nHere are some key differences to take note of when checking if your logo is up to date:\n\nDr Bubbles\n\nYou will notice that the new Dr. Bubbles mascot has less detail - for example there are no bubbles, no shading or suckers on their tentacles. You will also notice that the lines on the new Dr. Bubbles are thicker and use more vibrant colors.\n\nWordmark\n\nThis one is a little harder to recognize, but there are two key differences to look for: The new wordmark uses an upper-case ‘S’ and has a modified ‘el’ ligature - which means they are connected into one shape.\n\nColors\n\nOur palette reflects the aquatic theme inherent in the Snorkel name, Check out and download our color swatches.\n\nTypography\n\nGet a clear picture of our fonts, their colors, capitalization, kerning and leading, typescale, and more.\n\nLogos\n\nUse our logo and beloved Dr. Bubbles mascot with care.

Any changes to these Terms will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you (if applicable) or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Site.

Continued use of our Site following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.\n\n8.2 Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.\n\nApplicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.\n\nNotice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 550 Hamilton Avenue, Suite 300, Palo Alto, California 94301. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.\n\nArbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”) governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.\n\nAdditional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.\n\nTime Limits. If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.\n\nAuthority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.\n\nWaiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.\n\nWaiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\n\nConfidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.\n\nSeverability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\n\nRight to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.\n\nSurvival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.\n\nSmall Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.\n\nEmergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.\n\nClaims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.\n\nCourts. In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Santa Clara County, California, for such purpose.\n\n8.3. Export. The Site may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from Company, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.\n\n8.4. Disclosures. Company is located at the address in Section 8.8. If you are a California resident, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Product of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.\n\n8.5. Electronic Communications. The communications between you and Company use electronic means, whether you use the Site or send us emails, or whether Company posts notices on the Site or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were be in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.\n\n8.6. Entire Terms. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation”. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to Company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Company’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Company may freely assign these Terms. The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be binding upon assignees.\n\n8.7. Copyright/Trademark Information. Copyright © 2020 Snorkel AI, Inc.

You may send us requests for this information to privacy@snorkel.ai.

References to \"personal information\" in this Privacy Policy are equivalent to “personal data” governed by European data protection legislation. Essentially, it boils down to information about an individual, from which that individual is either directly identified or can be identified. It does not include 'anonymous data' (i.e., information where the identity of individual has been permanently removed).\n\nController. Snorkel AI, Inc. is the controller of your personal information covered by this Privacy Policy for purposes of European data protection legislation. See the Contact Us section above for contact details.\n\nLegal bases for processing. We use your personal information only as permitted by law, for the purposes for which we collected it as listed below. In respect of each of the purposes for which we use your personal information, the European data protection legislation requires us to ensure that we have a \"legal basis\" for that use. Our legal bases for processing your personal information described in this Privacy Policy are listed below.\n\nWhere we need to perform a contract, we are about to enter into or have entered into with you (\"Contractual Necessity\").\n\nWhere it is necessary for our legitimate interests and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests (\"Legitimate Interests\"). More detail about the specific legitimate interests pursued in respect of each Purpose we use your personal information for is set out in the table below.\n\nWhere we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation (\"Compliance with Law\").\n\nWhere we have your specific consent to carry out the processing for the Purpose in question (\"Consent\"). Generally, we do not rely on your Consent as a legal basis for using your personal information other than in the context of direct marketing communications.\n\nWe have set out below, in a table format, the legal bases we rely on in respect of the relevant Purposes for which we use your personal information.\n\nUse for new purposes. We may use your personal information for reasons not described in this Privacy Policy where permitted by law and the reason is compatible with the purpose for which we collected it. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis.\n\nSensitive personal information. We ask that you not provide us with any sensitive personal information (e.g., information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Service, or otherwise to us. If you provide us with any sensitive personal information to us when you use the Service, you must consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information, you must not submit such sensitive personal information through our Service.\n\nAutomated Decision-Making and Profiling. We may use automated decision-making and/or profiling in regard to your personal information when you apply for a job opportunity and for automated lead qualification when you submit your information to receive a demo. You can request a manual review of the accuracy of an automated decision that you are unhappy with or limit or object to such automated decision-making and/or profiling by contacting us at privacy@snorkel.ai\n\nRetention\n\nWe retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes.\n\nTo determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.\n\nWhen we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If we anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.\n\nYour rights\n\nEuropean data protection laws give you certain rights regarding your personal information. If you are located within the European Union, you may ask us to take the following actions in relation to your personal information that we hold:\n\nAccess. Provide you with information about our processing of your Personal Data and give you access to your Personal Data.\n\nCorrect. Update or correct inaccuracies in your Personal Data.\n\nDelete. Delete your Personal Data.\n\nTransfer. Transfer a machine-readable copy of your Personal Data to you or a third party of your choice.\n\nRestrict.

Stop sending you direct marketing communications. You may continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing emails.\n\nYou may submit these requests by email to privacy@snorkel.ai or our postal address provided above. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions. If you would like to submit a complaint about our use of your personal information or our response to your requests regarding your personal information, you may contact us or submit a complaint to the data protection regulator in your jurisdiction. You can find your data protection regulator here.\n\nCross-Border Data Transfer\n\nIf we transfer your personal information out of Europe to a country not deemed by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of personal information protection, the transfer will be performed:\n\nPursuant to the recipient’s compliance with standard contractual clauses, EU-US Privacy Shield (or Swiss-US Privacy Shield, as applicable), or Binding Corporate Rules\n\nPursuant to the consent of the individual to whom the personal information pertains\n\nAs otherwise permitted by applicable European requirements.\n\nYou may contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal information out of Europe.",

I think I was just contacted about the same thing you must be doing for them. A recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn saying they're looking for expert contributors in my area. He made it sound super urgent. The gig involves writing multiple choice questions and reviewing those of others. They pay you per accepted question and per reviewed question. I said I'd like to learn more. I literally just got an email from HireArt offering me a contract and asking for some standard hiring info (eg, background check, independent contractor paperwork, etc...). I looked up Snorkel AI and HireArt and both seem legit as far as I can tell, but you know, with all the scams out there and with how rushed it seemed, I am a tad wary. Does what I described sound like what you're doing for them as well? How do you like it so far? Is it tricky to get your questions accepted or would you say it's pretty fair / they're not pulling a fast one on you?\n\n#### Comment ID m3dkmm7 with +3 score by [(devotionanddoubt, Reddit, 2024-12-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/1gtmh52/has_anyone_had_success_applying_with_snorkel_ai/m3dkmm7/) (in reply to ID m3djl12):\nThis is exactly what I did for them!

You can expect problems that focus on data structures and algorithms, often leaning towards the upper end of medium difficulty. The coding challenges might include topics like tree traversals, dynamic programming, or graph algorithms. It's not just about solving the problem, but also discussing your approach and optimizing your solution.\n\nThe interviewers at Snorkel AI are known to value clear communication and problem-solving skills as much as technical prowess. They'll likely ask you to explain your thought process as you work through the problem. Be prepared to discuss trade-offs between different approaches and to optimize your initial solution. If you're feeling unsure about tackling these types of questions, you might find this [interview AI tool](http://interviews.chat) helpful.

From my understanding, they tend to focus on more medium-to-hard LeetCode problems (think 600-800+ questions). One thing that helped me when I was in a similar spot was using this AI tool that listens to the interview and suggests responses in real time. It's not a guaranteed fix, but it made me feel more confident.\n\nTo be honest, my experience with them was pretty standard - they had a coding challenge on HackerRank and then asked some behavioral questions afterwards. They also discussed their company culture and values a bit during the conversation. If you want to know more about the tool I used, I'd be happy to share it with you! \n\nKeep in mind that every interview is different, but hopefully this gives you a rough idea of what to expect.

There is an analysis step where you get feedback as to complexity and other parameters.

A few days after that email they will terminate you for non compliance.

Yes, it’s part time work. When you feel like making a little extra money with that degree. I was able to buy something I’ve been wanting for a while with the extra pay. Getting started was slow but once I learn how it all works, with other people signed up to review your work and all, it’s not bad. Snorkel just seems thorough and seems some other users/the community can say your work needs revision. I do think some people get turned off by the idea of other people reviewing your work. but otherwise, once i figured it out, it’s been profitable.\n\n### Comment ID mgmnk15 with +1 score by [(Mysterious-Use-7505, Reddit, 2025-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFHJobs/comments/1i0bwsn/is_snorkelai_a_scam/mgmnk15/) (in reply to ID mf14qw4):\nI agree with you.

Here's what we heard the most:\n\n**Google Sheets doesn't work:** Annotating and inspecting data manually is painful.  \n  \n**Data vendor dependency:** Relying solely on external vendors doesn’t always cut it.  \n  \n**Hacky internal tools:** Building in-house tools for custom annotation workflows is frustrating and time-consuming.\n\nThis is what they want:\n\n✅ LLM + Human Evaluation: Run LLM-as-a-judge evaluations on your annotated datasets and reconcile scores with human feedback.  \n  \n✅ Annotation Projects: Manage annotation projects effortlessly, including assigning tasks to external annotators.  \n  \n✅ Customizable Labeling Schemas: Design flexible labeling schemas to meet your team’s specific needs.  \n  \n✅ Advanced Metrics: Track inter-annotator agreement rates and time spent per data point to ensure high-quality annotations.\n\nHere are a few data annotation platforms that I know of:\n\n1. [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/)\n\n2. [SuperAnnotate](https://superannotate.com/)\n\n3. [Athina Annotate](https://docs.athina.ai/annotations/overview)\n\n4. Snorkel AI\n\n5.

This will help to attract a wider range of perspectives and experiences, which can lead to greater innovation and success.

There is a lack of effort and not to mention a strong bias towards diverse talent, which is troubling given the many talented individuals from different backgrounds who could bring valuable perspectives and experiences to the table. We have lost some fantastic people, including a great leader at the C-level. This is partly due to the company's failure to recognize and value the contributions of diverse employees.",

Despite our imperfections, I am confident that we are filled with kind, caring and empathetic people at all levels in the organization. We care about diversity at this company - we invest in fair and equitable processes in hiring and sourcing talent, and we do our best to ensure diverse people and voices always have a seat at the table. And at the core, we care about our employees - their wellbeing, their sense of belonging and their ability to find success and fulfillment while they’re with us. It’s disappointing to hear that you haven’t seen or experienced this. I do want to set the record straight that we have not had any C-level departures at the company - I’m not sure what you’re referring to with that statement.\n\nWhile I haven’t yet heard this type of feedback from any current or former member of the team, we are very committed to listening and learning about ways we can improve the employee experience.

      "# [How Snorkel’s Obsession with Data Fuels Its Success in Enterprise AI by Greylock Partners on 2024-11-12](https://greylock.com/greymatter/snorkel-data-enterprise-ai/)\nWhen Alex Ratner joined the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL) as a PhD student in 2014, he planned on spending most of his time researching better machine learning modeling techniques and algorithms. This, after all, was the main thrust of AI development at the time.\n\nBut not long after starting in the lab, a variety of people from across the Stanford campus began coming to him with unusual requests. Genomics collaborators at the Stanford Medical Center said they were buckling under the time-consuming effort of prepping and labeling thousands of patient records that they needed to train AI models for automating tasks like pulling facts from the scientific literature. Radiologists wanted the Lab’s help labeling medical imaging and monitoring datasets for triaging cases in under-resourced hospital systems. In these cases, and many more, there was no ask for a new algorithm or model. The pain point was all about labeling and curating training data.\n\n“At first, we ignored these requests, thinking – like most did in AI then – that this wasn’t our problem,” says Ratner. “Labeling and developing the data used for training and evaluating AI models was viewed as an upstream janitorial task. All people cared about in AI was the fancy new model.”\n\nBut then he and several SAIL colleagues considered whether it was time to adjust their focus. “All these users were telling us they were getting stuck on the data before they could even get to the algorithms,” Ratner remembers. “We decided to start thinking about this messier system-building problem that seemed to be blocking real-world AI progress 90% of the time. It turned out there was something really meaty that no one else was paying attention to.”\n\nData, Data, Data\n\nIn fact, the process of training models with the right data became far more important than Ratner and his team initially surmised. He now regards data — whether patient records, financial reports, maintenance manuals, or customer databases — to be the deciding factor in whether a machine learning project succeeds or fails.\n\nThe customers of Snorkel AI, the company Ratner and four colleagues spun out of SAIL in 2019, seem to agree. Memorial Sloan Kettering works with Snorkel to automate the process of understanding pathology reports and identifying potential patients for clinical trials. Wayfair uses the company’s Snorkel Flow product to tag product information for better, more accurate search results. Seven of the top US banks use Snorkel to extract information from complex financial documents. In each case, Snorkel has helped companies shrink the time to prepare and label their raw data from months down to weeks.\n\nRatner attributes these successes to those lessons learned back at Stanford in 2014. “Everyone at Snorkel spends time with customers, and we build based on that feedback,” he says. “It’s this philosophy of listening to our customers and building in the field with them that drives us.”\n\nA Pivotal Mentor\n\nA New Jersey native and Harvard physics major, Ratner landed at Stanford’s computer science PhD program after 18 months of trying to get an AI startup called SiftPage off the ground. It was a largely self-taught, solo endeavor. After doing related work at a small consulting firm and taking some Coursera courses on AI, he started SiftPage which involved extracting data from patents and other legal documents, on his own. Applying to Stanford reflected both his academic side (“I’ve always loved abstract problem solving.”) and a turn toward a formal education in computer science and AI.\n\nAt Stanford, Ratner studied and researched under the tutelage of Christopher Ré, a MacArthur genius grant winner, Stanford AI lab faculty member, and serial entrepreneur. In the summer of 2015, Ré, who later became one of Snorkel’s co-founders, urged Ratner to investigate the data management requests SAIL was getting from various points around the campus, framing it as a low-pressure “afternoon project.” When it ballooned into something much bigger, Ratner and his team (Snorkel co-founders Paroma Varma, Braden Hancock, and Henry Ehrenberg) began developing experimental open-source software for programmatically labeling training data. They hosted weekly “office hours” to test their ideas and find out what other developers wanted to see. Tech teams at Google and Intel began using the open-source software.\n\nAs word spread, the weekly office hours often swelled to 50 or 60 people. A team of more than a dozen Accenture consultants and partners showed up, as did journalists from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Investors reached out with offers for seed money to start a company, applying increasing pressure for Ratner to drop out of the PhD program and take the funding. His advisor counseled patience.\n\n“I got really good advice and support from Chris [Ré] to be patient with listening to the messy, painful problems of users and not to rush this work,” says Ratner, who stayed at Stanford for two more years before the team left the lab, raised funding, and set up shop at Greylock’s Menlo Park office.\n\nThe surging interest, however, became a clear indicator for how broadly applicable the problem of organizing and labeling AI training data was. “The fact that there was such excitement even for a lightweight system meant this was a much bigger shift in how people thought about developing AI,” Ratner says.\n\nBetting Big on a Huge Customer\n\nWhile Snorkel’s open-source project had no shortage of big-name tech company users from their days at Stanford, what the company now needed was paying customers, who could act as “design partners” for the new startup. The first big lead came during a banking industry innovation summit in Menlo Park. A leading US-based bank was looking to develop AI to help it comply with the industry-wide transition from one credit benchmarking rate to another. This so-called LIBOR transition represented a huge undertaking, requiring an understanding of each instance where the old rate was used across all of the bank’s global contracts. The bank wanted to come by Snorkel’s offices and talk.\n\nStill in its early stages, Snorkel still had fewer than 15 employees and was settling into new offices in Palo Alto. In an attempt to make their office look more populated, Ratner remembers frantically unpacking computers that had been ordered for future employees. Impressed with what they saw, the bank eventually asked Snorkel to help them develop a machine learning application that would save the company hundreds of hours of tedious labor.\n\nSnorkel had a decision to make. The five co-founders wondered about the implications of working with a major financial institution with more than 200,000 employees. “It was this very gnarly, very high-stakes problem with a very large organization,” Ratner says. “There were debates among the co-founding team and our advisors that this was going to take away resources from our open-source build.”\n\nIn the end, Snorkel decided that this opportunity, while risky, was an unparalleled chance to learn. It also represented an ideal use case for Snorkel’s software. “We always knew the biggest need for our product would be with sophisticated teams who were working with lots of private data that they needed for training specialized AI models,” Ratner says. In addition, the automation of the bank’s LIBOR transition wasn’t just another AI pilot project; it would deliver an actual eight-to-nine-figure ROI for the business. For the next several months, the Snorkel team went all in on understanding the documents that would train the AI application, then worked with the bank’s technical teams to build software that could automatically adjust contracts to the new financial standard.\n\nThe project became a model for Snorkel’s R&D. For the first few customers in each sector, the company dove deeply into each organization’s unique data sets, business objectives, and specific AI-enabled applications they wanted to build. In 2022, the company folded these learnings into Snorkel Flow, its standardized, generally available platform.\n\nA Ferocious Hype Cycle\n\nBy this time, Snorkel customers spanned not just the banking industry, but also telecom, biotech, oil and gas, and the federal government. In 2022, the 3-year-old company posted triple-digit customer growth. It seemed like nothing could stop the momentum.\n\nThen ChatGPT appeared. By March 2023, when version 3 of the large language model chatbot launched, nearly all of Snorkel’s early sales conversations came to a screeching halt. As companies scrambled to redraft their AI strategies, re-org their teams, and get low-hanging-fruit chatbot demos built as quickly as possible, conversations with external platform vendors like Snorkel were deprioritized. Ratner recalls the mood: “People thought, ‘Why do I need to do data development? I’m just going to use ChatGPT for everything, to create my data set, to train my model.’ People thought it was magic. The whole market hit a red pause button.”\n\nThe Snorkel team knew that ChatGPT, while a remarkable advancement, couldn’t do everything. If anything, out-of-the-box models like ChatGPT elevated the need for solutions that could help evaluate and specialize them on specific sets of data. There would always be simple AI use cases, such as copywriting assistants or chatbots for common customer questions, that could leverage ChatGPT without much modification. But for many uses, companies would need to input their own data. “The hype ignored the common sense that no matter how smart a model gets, it can’t know the private data and private objectives and standards of an enterprise,” Ratner says.\n\nAs the fever broke, companies began to realize that bigger wasn’t always better. Deriving real value from AI meant developing intelligence from highly specific data. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Snorkel booked more revenue than it had in its nearly four years as a company.\n\nGreylock partner and Snorkel board member Saam Motamedi attributes the Snorkel team’s success to a rare combination of scientific expertise and industry pragmatism. “They stayed laser-focused on their original insight of the importance of the data, which has become the bedrock of their success.”\n\nRepeatedly Firing Himself\n\nAs Ratner migrated from researcher and PhD student to CEO of a now 190-employee company, he learned to dramatically adjust the way he spends his days. “One of our advisors wisely told me that my job as CEO is to fire myself as rapidly and repeatedly as possible,” he says.\n\nThe first role he fired himself from was software developer. “Letting go of day-to-day edits to the codebase I spent years on was a tough step,” recalls Ratner, “but at a certain point of scale it was clear I was blocking more than helping.” More recently, he sacked himself as the company’s internal lead for messaging and positioning, hiring an experienced marketing executive.\n\nRatner says he tries to stay connected to important areas of the company in “spikes.” For a set period of time, he goes deep into some initiative or problem where he thinks he can have impact. One of these current spikes, he says, is creating the next iteration of Snorkel’s product roadmap. On another occasion, he stepped into product development, helping to define the plan around Snorkel’s ability to support generative AI use cases.\n\nWith no shortage of interest from the marketplace, Ratner says his goal as CEO is to keep executing effectively, listening to customers, and tuning out the hype. On a day-to-day level, this entails taking a bifurcated approach: either going deep in founder mode or operating at a higher level in manager mode and fully trusting the people he’s hired. “Leaders sometimes get lost in the middle,” he says. “They have their hands in a lot of things, but they’re not deep enough to really contribute and not removed enough to be scaling efficiently. I’m always trying to do this better – to really go deep and lean in wherever I can help, no matter how tactical. And to quickly fire myself where I can’t.”",
      "# [LLM evaluation in enterprise applications: a new era in ML by Matthew Casey on 2024-11-25](https://snorkel.ai/llm-evaluation-primer/)\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are redefining what’s possible across industries. They represent a significant leap forward in transforming enterprise processes and enhancing customer interactions. However, LLM evaluation poses complex challenges for enterprises who wish to deploy them.\n\nLLMs behave differently from traditional models, meaning data scientists must assess them differently. Traditional record-by-record assessments used in machine learning don’t apply. Off-the-shelf solutions, while useful, will rarely boost an LLM system’s performance high enough to meet an organization’s production requirements. Organizations that wish to deploy customized LLM systems must instead evaluate them by scalably applying their expert’s assessment.\n\nIn this post, we’ll explore what challenges data scientists face with LLM evaluation and how to overcome them.\n\nThe challenges of LLM evaluation\n\nFor enterprises, defining what constitutes “success” for a Generative AI (GenAI) model isn’t clear-cut. Different outputs can all be correctly contextualized, making it tough to establish uniform benchmarks.\n\nThis nuance demands more sophisticated, flexible evaluation frameworks for context-specific accuracy and relevancy. Without these, enterprises risk deploying models that neither align with nor enhance their strategic goals.\n\nThese challenges demand more than simply relying on traditional accuracy metrics. Organizations must develop criteria that incorporate factors such as coherence, creativity, adaptability, and the best judgment of the organization’s Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Each of these factors contributes to a model’s overall effectiveness, yet they are extraordinarily difficult to quantify.\n\nAdditionally, large language model failure modes pose a troubling basket of risks; an inaccurate response from a predictive model may only result in a wrong classification, but a flawed GenAI response could result in poor user experiences or misinformation. Thus, enterprises must carefully craft evaluation measures that not only address basic functionality but also the subtleties and implications of real-world applications.\n\nCommon evaluation criteria\n\nEnterprises typically rely on a suite of common criteria to evaluate LLMs. These often include:\n\nAccuracy: How well does the model output match the expected content or intent?\n\nCompliance: Does the output adhere to regulatory and organizational guidelines?\n\nSafety: Is the language generated by the model free from harmful or offensive content?\n\nExplainability: Can the outputs be easily interpreted and understood by users?\n\nRobustness: How well does the model maintain performance across varying inputs?\n\nThese criteria offer a foundational approach to assessing LLM performance and are integral to fostering trust and security within AI applications. Accuracy ensures that models deliver reliable and relevant information, while compliance and toxicity controls protect user safety and align with legal standards. Explainability and robustness further enhance the user experience, enabling an understanding of model decisions and ensuring consistent performance across diverse scenarios.\n\nWhy common criteria fall short\n\nGeneralized criteria might gauge a model’s basic performance but largely ignore an organization’s specific needs and values, which can be best-assessed by the organization’s internal experts.\n\nA customer service AI must not only produce accurate responses but also align with the company’s tone and style guidelines to maintain brand consistency. Among many other potential nuances, an organization might want to ensure a customer-facing chatbot never mentions its competitors—something generic evaluation approaches will miss. Sectors like healthcare or finance demand additional layers of compliance, empathy, and precision in communication that generalized criteria are ill-equipped to address comprehensively.\n\nEven different business units within the same organization might prioritize different aspects of generative outputs. A marketing team might value creativity and engagement above all, whereas a legal department might focus on compliance and accuracy. Generalized criteria do not adapt to the multifaceted nature of enterprise operations, necessitating more tailored, adaptive approaches to LLM evaluation.\n\nGeneralized solutions for LLM evaluation\n\nIn response to LLM evaluation challenges, researchers and data scientists have developed useful generalized solutions, such as benchmarks and LLMs that judge other LLMs.\n\nBenchmarks for LLM evaluation\n\nLLM benchmarks make an LLM act like a traditional machine learning model. These systems give the model a prompt with a narrow, defined answer space and then judge whether the model responds correctly.\n\nResearchers have developed a wide array of benchmark sets, including SuperGLUE. This set includes a variety of language-understanding tasks. Many of them ask binary questions, such as whether or not there will be a 13th season of the TV show Criminal Minds based on a paragraph about its renewal.\n\nOther prompts ask multiple-choice questions or prompt the model to respond with a number between 1 and 7 to indicate how distressed an author was feeling. The numerical approach can yield more nuanced results, as it can quantify not just whether or not the model was wrong but also how wrong it was.\n\nBenchmarks offer a clear comparative framework for establishing standards. The Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) program at Stanford has collected SuperGLUE and many other benchmarks into customizable leaderboards.\n\nBenchmarks often serve as a starting point—a way to assess whether a model meets basic industry expectations. However, these benchmarks may not correspond directly with a company’s unique needs. To bridge this gap, enterprises must develop bespoke benchmarks for each use case they want to address.\n\nReadily available models can handle some aspects of LLM evaluation that don’t fit into the benchmark format.\n\nHugging Face, for example, hosts many models that can evaluate text for sentiment and toxicity. Data scientists can use models like these to evaluate different foundation models and track how responses from their chosen model change as they fine-tune it or iterate on their prompt templates.\n\nWhile these can serve as a useful starting point, they will likely not satisfy every organization’s needs. The marketing department for a consumer products company may have a higher bar for what qualifies as “positive” than the compliance department at a bank, for example.\n\nFortunately, these models can be customized to fit an organization’s needs.\n\nLLM as judges\n\nThe LLM-as-judge approach asks one LLM to judge the output of another.\n\nIn a basic setup, a pipeline will feed a prompt to the LLM under evaluation. Then, the pipeline combines the evaluated LLM’s response with the original prompt and asks the judging LLM to assess the response’s quality.\n\nThis approach offers exciting potential because it enables greater nuance than benchmarks while also enabling high throughput. An LLM-as-judge can evaluate many prompt/response pairs in the time that it would take a human to judge just one.\n\nWhile powerful, the resulting judgments reflect the limitations and biases inherent in the judge LLM’s training data and instructions. Snorkel AI researchers once experimented with improving the performance of a 7-billion parameter open-source LLM through an approach called “direct preference optimization” (DPO). Their model soared up the AlpacaEval leaderboard. However, their analysis revealed that their Snorkel-Mistral-PairRM-DPO model achieved its success in part by accidentally exploiting the judge LLM’s biases. The judge preferred longer answers, regardless of whether the additional content added greater understanding.\n\nLike benchmarks, off-the-shelf LLM-as-judge setups can help guide an organization’s choices when choosing and customizing a model, but they are unlikely to elevate a model to production quality.\n\nMoving to custom LLM evaluation\n\nWhen generic LLM evaluation approaches reach their limit, enterprise data scientists must shift their approach to custom evaluation methods.\n\nRegardless of what customized approach you use, it should be well grounded in feedback from and collaboration with appropriate subject matter experts.\n\nCustomized LLM-as-judge\n\nData scientists can customize their “judge” LLM through one of two approaches:\n\nFine-tuning: Adjusting an LLM to be better at judging other LLMs.\n\nPrompt iteration: Crafting and re-crafting an appropriate prompt template to induce reliable judgments from a foundation model.\n\nFor many organizations, working with SMEs to craft the right prompt template will succeed in directing a full-sized frontier model to reflect the SMEs’ judgement closely enough to serve as a reliable proxy. This may be more work than it sounds like, but less work than fine-tuning a customized judge model.\n\nQuality models\n\nAt Snorkel AI, our researchers and engineers have also tried the “quality model” approach.\n\nIn this approach, data scientists collaborate with subject matter experts to label a corpus of prompt/response pairs as accepted or rejected on specific criteria. With the dataset assembled, the data scientists can train a small neural network to act as the SME’s proxy.\n\nOur researchers and engineers enhance this process by adapting SME’s explanations into scalable labeling functions. This amplifies SME impact while minimizing the amount of time they must dedicate to the project. Data scientists can achieve a similar approach with standard manual labeling, but they may struggle to secure sufficient SME time for this approach.\n\nQuality models can assess responses holistically or on specific aspects—format or tone, for example. Holistic quality models offer a lot of power as a headline approach, but some teams may want to add one or more narrowly focused quality models to address specific LLM performance complaints.\n\nData slices and the need for fine-grained evaluation\n\nIn addition to evaluating LLM responses according to an organization’s specific needs and standards, they should also parse this evaluation according to specific tasks the organization cares about.\n\nAt Snorkel, we create detailed “data slices” by labeling prompts according to what kind of task they represent. This segments data into relevant scenarios—for instance, inquiries in Spanish or requests to cancel a customer account. Such fine-grained analysis unveils strengths and deficiencies that generalized assessments might miss, providing a clearer picture of a model’s suitability across varied contexts.\n\nBy focusing on specific segments and scenarios, enterprises gain actionable insights that can be used to fine-tune models and improve outcomes. In practice, this means leveraging frameworks like Snorkel Flow to customize criteria and model parameters, creating tailored evaluation processes that reflect an organization’s core objectives and operational intricacies.\n\nFrom LLM evaluation to actionable insights\n\nUltimately, evaluations must do more than diagnose; they must provide actionable insights that drive continuous improvement. Knowing where a model falls short is not enough; enterprises need pathways to address these gaps effectively. Actionable insights form the bridge from evaluation to development, allowing teams to implement strategic improvements. Snorkel Flow not only emphasizes identifying these insights but also facilitates the creation of actionable workflows that integrate seamlessly with enterprise objectives.\n\nAs LLMs carve out an increasingly significant role in enterprise applications, understanding and implementing robust evaluation frameworks grows more important. By moving towards specialized, task-driven evaluation methods crafted in deep consultation with SMEs, organizations can better harness the transformative power of LLMs, ensuring alignment with their unique needs and strategic goals.\n\nLearn More",
      "# [Snorkel AI dives into hot market of data curation by Diana Goovaerts on 2024-04-19](https://www.fierce-network.com/cloud/snorkel-ai-dives-hot-market-data-curation)\nEnterprises want specially trained AI models\n\nCompanies need data that is labeled to effectively fine tune AI\n\nPlayers like Snorkel AI are tackling this issue in the increasingly important data curation market\n\nIf you’re an enterprise looking to adopt generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), you probably want a model that’s been fine tuned to meet the needs of your specific vertical or – better still – your specific company. That specialized training requires data and lots of it. But how do you know which files in your vast trove of storage are the right ones to train the model to do what you want it to?\n\nEnter data curation.\n\nCompanies like Snorkel AI, Snowflake, Databricks, Appen, Scale AI and LabelBox are all staking a claim in what is poised to become a very important market.\n\n“This is a hot area, an important area,” AvidThink’s Roy Chua told Fierce.\n\n“All of it comes down to how do you manage the ModelOps problem and also the DataOps or MLOps, which is how do you clean the data, how do you prepare the data, how do you manage data for AI and machine learning in general.”\n\nZooming in\n\nFor its part, Snorkel is solving the data curation problem with software. Co-founder Paroma Varma told Fierce the idea is to transform what is mostly a tedious manual process today and transform it into something that can be done programmatically.\n\nThe way it works is that Snorkel takes domain knowledge from subject matter experts and encodes that into a series of rules. The software – known as Snorkel Flow – then uses an algorithm to decide which rule should be applied to the data to categorize it. Once all the data is labeled, it is then fed into a model. The model’s responses are then checked for errors, and if any are discovered Snorkel can trace the source of the problem and correct it.\n\n“I think anyone who’s working with AI today needs to develop their data,” Varma said. “If you use your model out of the box what we’re seeing is for these specialized enterprise use cases, these models rarely work. They’ll give you accuracies in the 30%, 20% range, just not ready for production yet. And then the only lever is your data, so you want to be able to develop it fast…so that you can continue your AI development process.”\n\nSnorkel, she said, can condense the data development process from something like six months down to a few hours. And, Varma added, AI deployments aren’t a one and done process. The data used to train the models constantly needs to be updated so that it continues to meet business objectives. If there’s an error or a blind spot, enterprises don’t want that to take a year to fix.\n\nEarlier this month, Snorkel released its second product – Snorkel Custom – which offers customers the chance to partner with the company’s researchers and engineers to build LLM pipelines. In a nutshell, Snorkel is taking and owning the end-to-end approach with Snorkel Custom rather than leaving the last bit to enterprises.\n\nVarma said Snorkel AI’s technology was originally developed as a project in the Stanford AI lab in 2015. It later became its own company in 2019. To date, Snorkel has raised more than $135 million and as of 2021 had a valuation of $1 billion.\n\nDiving into the future\n\nChua said he expects Snorkel will soon “get snapped up by someone,” be that a hyperscaler or even a competitor. The caveat is that it first needs to demonstrate that it is gaining traction in the market, he said. But Snorkel already has.\n\nVarma told Fierce that Snorkel is working with many Fortune 500 companies and seven of the top 10 U.S. banks. It also has customers in the healthcare, e-commerce (hello again, Wayfair!) and insurance verticals.\n\nEarlier this year, the investment arm of insurance Group QBE said it invested an undisclosed sum in the company. QBE said at the time that its North American division has been using Snorkel Flow to aid predictive analytics.",
      "# [Walkthrough for annotators](https://docs.snorkel.ai/docs/0.94/user-guide/annotation/walkthrough-for-annotators)\nThis page walks through the process of manually annotating documents in Annotation Studio. This walkthrough is designed for users with the Annotator role, who need to access Snorkel Flow to annotate the documents that are assigned to them. Below, you'll find an interactive demo showing how to annotate your data.\n\nThe instructions below further outline what you saw in the interactive demo.\n\nAfter you log in to Snorkel Flow, you need to access your batches to start annotating. Batches are a collection of documents that are assigned to you to manually annotate. A batch is typically a subset of the total documents. With Snorkel Flow, the number of documents that need to be manually annotated is significantly smaller.\n\nTo access your batches, click My work on the left-side menu.\n\nThe My work page shows a list of batches for you to annotate:\n\nThe following information about each batch is available:\n\nBatch: The name of the batch.\n\nStatus: Specifies whether annotations on the batch have not be started, are in progress, or have been completed.\n\nAnnotators: The list of annotators that have been assigned to annotate the batch.\n\nAnnotated: The number of documents in the batch that have been annotated.\n\nSize: The total number of documents that are in the batch.\n\nCreated: The date that the batch was created.\n\nNow, you can start annotating your documents!\n\nOnce you click Annotate, your screen will look similar to the image below:\n\nThe main canvas shows the document text. For classification and extraction applications, the right side-pane shows all classes that you can label the document.\n\nHere is some information about the various buttons that you can see on your screen:\n\nClick Data view (or Document view for extraction applications) to change the appearance of the documents in the main canvas. The views that are available differ based on the application type.\n\nClick the Filter icon to filter the documents that are shown to you. For example, you can use the filter to just show the documents that have comments on them.\n\nClick the gear icon to adjust various settings. We recommend that you adjust a few settings before you get started annotating.\n\nClick the arrow icons to page through the documents.\n\nClick the tag icon to add tags to the document. For example, you can tag documents that you find confusing and want to bring up for discussion.\n\nClick the comment icon to add comments to the document. For example, you can write a comment to explain your reasoning behind a selecting a particular label.\n\nAfter accessing your documents, we recommend that you first adjust some settings to get some quality of life improvements while annotating! To change your settings, click the gear icon at the top-right corner of your screen. We recommend changing the following settings:\n\nSelect display columns: This setting lets you select and display only the data columns that are necessary for marking your annotations (e.g., the text column). This removes clutter from the main canvas when you are reviewing documents.\n\nAuto-advance on label change: With this setting enabled, after you label a document, you automatically go to the next document. This prevents you from having to manually click the arrow icons to page through the documents every time to view new, unlabeled documents. This setting is only available for single-label and text extraction applications.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts: With this setting enabled, keys are assigned to each label class, which makes it quicker to assign a label. In the example below, if you want to label a document \"employment,\" then you just have to press 0 on your keyboard.\n\nHere are descriptions of the rest of the settings that are available when you click the gear icon:\n\nMark spaces (·): Replaces all spaces in your document with a dot (·).\n\nHyperlink URLs: Hyperlinks any URL in your document. This makes it easier to see links in your documents and allows you to click the hyperlink to go directly to the website.\n\nRight-to-left (RTL) text: Right justifies your document text. By default, the document text is left justified.\n\nGo to first unlabeled data: Brings you to the first document in the batch that has not yet been annotated. This option is helpful any time you re-enter a batch to continue annotating.\n\nExport Studio dataset: Export your dataset into a CSV file.\n\nThe following sections walk through how to annotate documents for the four different task types:\n\nsingle-label classification\n\nmulti-label classification\n\ntext extraction\n\nsequence tagging\n\nIn single-label classification applications, your goal is to assign a single class to each document. For example, assigning banking contract documents to one of the following classes: \"employment,\" \"loan,\" \"services,\" or \"stock.\" For more information about this setting, see Set the default label for multi-label annotation applications.\n\nOn the right-side pane, you'll see all possible classes that you can label your document. To label a document, click the class in the right-side menu. Then click the arrow button to move on to the next document. If you adjusted the recommended settings, then you use can use the keyboard shortcut to assign a class, and then you will automatically be brought to the next document.\n\nIn multi-label classification applications, individual documents can have multiple label values. For example, let's say you are looking at movie review documents. You can label the movie as \"Short Film,\" \"Black and White,\" \"Japanese Movies,\" or \"World Cinema.\" Given these labels, you can see that a single movie can fall into multiple categories. In this case, for a given document, you can label each possible class as present, absent, or abstain from voting.\n\nOn the right-side pane, you'll see all possible classes. For each class, you can click:\n\nto label the class as Abstain.\n\nto label the class as Present.\n\nto label the class as Absent.\n\nBy default, all classes are initially labeled as Abstain. If enabled for your application, you can set the default label for each class to either Present, Absent, or Abstain.\n\nYou can also sort the classes, which is particularly helpful for applications with a large number of classes. You can sort classes marked as Present first, classes marked as Absent first, or in Alphanumerical order.\n\nIn multi-label classification applications, individual documents can have multiple label values. For a given document, you can label each possible class as present, absent, or abstain from voting. From the Overview page, you have the option to set the default label value for your application. This is helpful in situations where different teams in your organization want their default label to be different based on their particular use case. In addition, this setting is application specific so it will only affect your current working application.\n\nFollow the steps below to set up your default label:\n\nClick the gear icon in the top right corner of your screen.\n\nIn modal, select a default label of Present, Absent, or Abstain from the dropdown.\n\nClick the Save button to save your changes.\n\nOpen a batch and then you'll see that for unlabeled documents, the default label is set as your selection.\n\nYou can now take one of the following actions when reviewing a document:\n\na. You can select labels however you like.\n\nb. You can go with the default labels by clicking the Confirm defaults button.\n\nYou can see the progress has gone up after you've completed either of the actions listed above and the state has changed to Labeled.\n\nIf you want to revert your changes and go back to the unlabeled state, click Labeled. The modal asks for your confirmation as this action cannot be undone.\n\nAfter you confirm, the document returns to an unlabeled state. You'll also see the Confirm defaults button again along with the default labels and progress.\n\nIn text extraction applications, the goal is to extract key information from a document. For example, let's say that we want to extract all dates from a document. In this case, a date is considered a span. Your goal in this example is to review all highlighted spans in a document and identify whether the highlighted spans are in fact dates. You can label each highlighted span as \"NEGATIVE,\" \"POSITIVE,\" or \"UNKNOWN\" in the right-side pane. In this example, \"POSITIVE\" means that the highlighted span is a date, and \"NEGATIVE\" means that the highlighted span is not a date.\n\nIf you adjusted the recommended settings, then you can use the keyboard shortcuts to label a span, and then automatically to be brought to the next highlighted span in the document.\n\nBy default, you will be viewing the spans in Document view. We recommend annotating in either Document view or Span view:\n\nDocument view shows the entire document on the main canvas. You can use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to navigate between spans of text to annotate. This view provides you with all context surrounding a span.\n\nSpan view shows a single span per page. With this view, you don't have all the context surrounding a span. However, the simplified view can enable you to more quickly annotate things like dates that are easy to identify with less context.\n\nIn sequence tagging applications, your goal is to highlight and label spans throughout a document. Spans are key pieces of information that you want to extract from a document. For example, let's say we want to identify all mentions of company names in a document. In this case, a company name is considered a span. Your goal is then to highlight and label all company names that you find while reading through the document.\n\nTo label spans in Annotation Studio:\n\nHighlight a span.\n\nSelect the label that you want for that span in the Annotation modal.\n\nIf you don't find any spans to label in the document, you can indicate this by clicking the Label entire document as OTHER button above the document text.\n\nAt any point, you can reset and clear all spans that you have labeled in the document by clicking the Remove all labels from document button above the document text.\n\nWhile you are annotating documents, you can see your progress percentage tick up in the right-hand corner of your screen.\n\nOnce you are finished, your progress bar will be labeled 100%, and the status will be updated to Complete on the Batches page.\n\nOccasionally a reviewer will leave comments on documents. For example, if you left a comment asking a clarifying question, a reviewer may respond to your comment. To see all documents with comments:\n\nClick the filter icon.\n\nClick Comments.\n\nUnder User, select the person that you want to see comments from. Alternatively, you can select Any user.\n\nClick the checkmark to save the filter.\n\nNow, just the documents with comments are shown, making it easier for you to review any comments.\n\nYou can follow similar steps to filter documents based on tags:",
      "# [Key concepts](https://docs.snorkel.ai/docs/0.93/user-guide/overview/key-concepts)\nThis page lists terminology used throughout the user guide and the Snorkel Flow interface.\n\nA dataset refers to the collection of data records you want to work with. It contains data sources assigned to relevant splits.\n\nA data source refers to a file that will be loaded into a specific data split in a dataset. Snorkel Flow currently supports CSV and Parquet formats. Each data source requires an index field that specifies a unique index for each row of the data. The indices must be unique across all splits within a dataset.\n\nAn application refers to a specific machine learning problem that you want to solve using Snorkel Flow. Implemented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) over operators, an application can be used to compose complex data flow pipelines from simpler building blocks. Applications can be visualized and manipulated in Application Studio or the Python SDK.\n\nCurrently, Snorkel Flow supports the following application templates:\n\nClassification: Classify datapoints as one of many labels.\n\nDate Extraction: Extract specific types of dates from documents.\n\nEmail Address Extraction: Extract email addresses from documents.\n\nhOCR Extraction: Extract structured information using hocr data (i.e. from pdfs).\n\nMulti-label Classification: Tag datapoints with zero, one, or more non-exclusive labels.\n\nMulti-label PDF Classification: Classify PDF documents with zero, one, or more non-exclusive labels.\n\nNative PDF Extraction: Extract structured information from Native PDFs.\n\nPDF Classification: Classify PDF documents as one of many labels.\n\nSequence Tagging: Classify tokens of documents as one of many labels.\n\nText Entity Classification: Extract entities, link them to canonical entities, and classify those entities.\n\nText Extraction: Extract entities by first identifying high-recall candidate spans and then classifying each as the target entity or not.\n\nUS Currency Extraction: Extract specific US dollar amounts from documents.\n\nA block is a convenient way to group operators that perform some key functionality (e.g. span extraction). They can be instantiated using Application templates, and it’s possible to chain multiple blocks together in a single application.\n\nSnorkel Flow Operators are functions that define transformations over dataframes. For instance, they may be used to clean data, extract candidate spans from documents, or group by and reduce predicted spans by document. Operators may be implemented as heuristics or learned models, whatever is most practical for your application. For advanced usage, the Python SDK also exposes utilities to register custom operators.\n\nSee Operators: Transform and process your data for more information.\n\nSnorkel Flow supports the following 4 data splits: train, dev, valid, test. All of them, except dev, can be uploaded by users. The dev split will be sampled from the train split.\n\nTrain: The partially labeled or unlabeled data to which Snorkel Flow will assign labels. It should represent the largest proportion of the dataset.\n\nDev: A subset of the train split is randomly sampled to create a dev split, which will be used for guiding the development of LFs and models.\n\nBy default, 10% of the train split, up to 10,000 samples, will be used for the dev split.\n\nGround truth labels for this split are optional and can be specified during data loading or annotated within Snorkel Flow.\n\nSnorkel Flow does not require the dev split to have GTs to generate labels for the train split.\n\nValid: The split used for tuning the hyperparameters of machine learning models. It requires labels, but can be labeled within Snorkel Flow.\n\nTest: The split used for evaluating models’ performance. It requires labels, but can be labeled within Snorkel Flow.\n\nThe key data programming abstraction in Snorkel, a labeling function (LF) is a programmatic rule or heuristic that assigns labels to unlabeled data. Each LF works on one class: to vote whether a data point has a certain label.\n\nSnorkel's core label model is responsible for estimating LF accuracies and aggregating them into training labels without relying on ground truth labels.\n\nSee the Labeling function builders index page for a full list of LFs that can be created in Snorkel Flow.\n\nA label package is created from a set of labeling functions. Snorkel Flow's core engine will combine, de-noise, and reweigh the outputs of each labeling function to generate labels for your data. You can create a label package in the Label page and see the available label packages in the LF Packages page.\n\nThree main label spaces are used for data representation, which you might come across while using Snorkel. They are multi label, sequence label, and single label spaces.\n\nSingle label - one data point can belong to only one class.\n\nMulti label - one data point can belong to multiple classes.\n\nSequence label - A datapoint in seq tagging is a document, which contains/consists of multiple spans, and each span can only have one class.\n\nExample: You are being offered employment at Some Company and you start on September 1st, 2022.\n\nDifferent label spaces can be used to perform specific operations on the above example. Here are some ways each of them could be used on the text:\n\nSingle label spaces can be used to find the company name in the pre-extracted/pre-determined span Single label spaces can also be used to label at the document level.\n\nSome Company -> company name label\n\nMulti label spaces can be used to label at the document level. Example: determine the category of a document.\n\nSome Company -> employment contract and personal email labels\n\nSequence label spaces can be used to detect spans in the text using character offsets, for example, dates or company names.\n\nA span is characterized by its character offsets (char_start, char_end)in the text, and each span is associated with a single label. (0, 8, ‘OTHER’) denotes a span starting at index 0, and ending at 8 belongs to OTHER class.\n\n(0, 8, \"OTHER\") corresponds to: You are -> OTHER label (8, 36, \"OTHER\") corresponds to: being offered employment at -> OTHER label (36, 47, \"COMPANY\") corresponds to: Some Company -> COMPANY label (48, 65, \"OTHER \") corresponds to: and you start on -> OTHER label (66, 86, \"DATE\") corresponds to: September 1st, 2022 -> DATE label\n\nEach application template is exclusive to one label space. When you’re working with a specific template, you can expect the GT formats to align with the label space associated with the application template.\n\nAll application templates that specify Multi label in their naming conventions use multi label as the label space. These are Multi-label Classification and Multi-label PDF Classification.\n\nAll Information Extraction tasks (applications that have the Information Extraction label on the application template cards) use single label spaces. These are US Currency Extraction, Native PDF Extraction, hOCR Extraction, Date Extraction, Email Address Extraction, and Text Extraction.\n\nSequence Tagging is the only application that uses sequence label spaces.\n\nAll other application templates also use single label spaces. These are PDF Classification and plain Classification, Utterance and Conversation Classification, and Text Entity Classification.\n\nIn this section we’ll show example formats for each label space for usage in our SDK for a given datapoint.\n\nMulti-label spaces ground truth is represented as a dictionary where there is a mapping from each label to one of PRESENT, ABSENT, or ABSTAIN:\n\nSequence tagging ground truth for a document is a list of spans, where each span is a triple of (char_start, char_end, label). The spans cannot be empty (char_start must be smaller than char_end). Overlapping or duplicating spans are not allowed. The sets of char offsets (char_start, char_end) must be sorted:\n\nSingle label space ground truth format is represented by their class label\n\nA training set is a set of labels generated by a label package for a certain split, e.g. the train split. You can create a training set from existing label packages in the LF Packages page and use the resulting labels to train a downstream machine learning model via the Python SDK or the Train page.\n\nSpans of texts extracted from the original document that the labeling functions and models operate over. For example, if your application extracts the focal entity of an article, then candidate spans are entities extracted from that article, and you will train a model to predict whether each span is the focal entity or not.\n\nCandidate/Span concept is relevant for information extraction and entity classification applications.\n\nMachine learning uses collected experience and data to improve a system’s performance. In many tasks, this experience is gained by doing experiments or making queries to the user. This treats the learner (ML model) as a passive recipient of data.\n\nActive learning, on the other hand, is the study on how to use the learner’s ability to gather data and act on the experience it receives.\n\nEntropy is the measure of distance from how close the predicted distribution is to a uniform distribution. A uniform distribution is when each predicted label is equally likely. For example, the entropy of a model where it thinks that each outcome is equally likely (each label could happen at X percent) would be 1.",
      "# [Snorkel Flow update makes it easier to use enterprise data with Llama 3, Gemini AI by Carl Franzen, www.facebook.com on 2024-04-24](https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/snorkel-flow-update-makes-it-easier-to-use-your-enterprise-data-with-llama-3-gemini-ai/)\nSnorkel AI, a four-year-old startup that grew out of the Stanford AI Lab has announced a major update to its signature product — a data labeling, filtering, curation and AI fine-tuning platform called Snorkel Flow, which will now be able to integrate directly with Google’s Gemini AI model family and Meta’s brand new Llama 3.\n\nSnorkel Flow was initially launched in March 2022 with the aim to drastically improve the process by which enterprises develop and deploy custom AI solutions, letting them take their data — whether it’s structured or unstructured documents — and help them automatically label, annotate, and organize it to make it useful as a source of truth and information for their AI apps and services.\n\n“Enterprises are hitting a wall in terms of what they’re able to accomplish with off-the-shelf LLMs that have been trained on the public internet for general purpose usage,” said Alex Ratner, co-founder and CEO of Snorkel AI, in a video call interview with VentureBeat conducted yesterday ahead of the announcement. “They haven’t been customized for [enterprises’] use cases, their data sets, their settings. That’s where we come in with our platform Snorkel Flow for doing data labeling, data development, and doing it radically more efficiently.”\n\nFor example, if your company wanted to build a chatbot for employees that answered their questions about internal policies and company holidays, Snorkel Flow could ensure those documents were labeled appropriately so the chatbot could find them and extract the relevant information when asked. Or, if you wanted to create a customer service chatbot that understood when a customer mentioned a specific product name, Snorkel Flow could help you tune the model to understand that name referred to a specific SKU.\n\nAccording to Ratner, the company’s specialty is “AI data development,” which includes “all of the labeling, but also the curation, picking the right data, filtering for high quality data, choosing the right mix of data, maybe augmenting it with synthetic data, all of that data development that gets a finely curated data set to actually tune [AI] models on.”\n\n“All the platform vendors, the cloud vendors, are announcing APIs for tuning models, but they don’t help you with actually getting the data ready to dump into that API, which is the entire hard part,” Ratner added.\n\nAt the time it launched, Snorkel Flow included features such as programmatic data labeling and collaborative AI development, which were adopted by major enterprises such as Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Chubb to improve AI model accuracy and development efficiency by 10 to 100 times, according to Snorkel. Seven of the top 10 U.S. banks are reportedly customers of the company, and Ratner said they were able to help some of them automatically label data for compliance with regulations reducing time spent on manual labeling from “six months to 24 hours.”\n\n“As base LLMs become pervasive, including powerful open-source options like Llama 3, the speed and accuracy with which data is continuously labeled and curated for fine-tuning and aligning LLMs becomes the key differentiator,” Ratner added in a press release sent to VentureBeat.\n\nA brand new Flow\n\nIn addition to allowing users to tap their enterprise data — organized and labeled by Snorkel’s AI — as a source of truth and information through tuned versions of Google Gemini and Llama 3, the Snorkel Flow platform received a boatload of additional upgrades today.\n\nIt will now integrates with Databricks Unity Catalog, Vertex AI, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, platforms that enterprises may already be using or wish to use to help them organize and control access to their data.\n\nMoreover, Snorkel Flow now supports programmatic labeling of multimodal data including images.\n\nThis is particularly timely, as enterprises are increasingly looking to leverage AI across various data modalities to gain more comprehensive insights and enhance decision-making processes.\n\nOne Snorkel customer that has already taken advantage of the image data labeling functionality is Wayfair, and Ratner said the goal was to provide the same “speed up” in labeling as with text documents, going from months or weeks to days or hours.\n\nMore secure Snorkel\n\nSnorkel has added new role-based access controls (RBAC) for Snorkel Flow account administrators, letting them control access to an enterprise’s data and where it can be used and accessed for AI development and responses.\n\nThe new RBAC features also enable administrators to control who can even upload data to an enterprise’s Snorkel Flow development account in the first place, and regulate access to any connected services or apps.\n\nThis is similar in some ways to the new Projects feature unveiled by OpenAI yesterday for its proprietary in-house models — but of course, Snorkel allows for enterprises to control access to multiple models from multiple vendors.\n\nAdditionally, Snorkel Flow now supports on-premise and air-gapped access to foundation models, allowing for greater compliance and data security.\n\nThis release also complements Snorkel’s recently launched enterprise AI accelerator, Snorkel Custom, which provides structured engagements to support enterprises from the initial evaluation phase through the tuning and optimization of AI models.\n\nFrom flashy demo to production value added\n\nIn general, Snorkel is aiming to help its enterprise customers realize the potential of generative AI by making their data as useful as possible, as fast as possible for fine-tuning AI models to their specific needs and use cases, as well as building AI-powered applications and services — ideally atop fine-tuned models.\n\n“It’s a pretty broad trend that we’re seeing,” Ratner told VentureBeat. “People had massive pressure to get some kind of [AI] demo out. The demo looked really good. Expectations were sky high, even compared to most hype cycles and just in tech history. And now there’s massive pressure to cross that chasm from flashy chat bot demo to production value.”\n\nSnorkel Flow and Snorkel Custom are now generally available, with pricing dependent on the specific use case.",
      "# [Snorkel AI Expands Platform with New Tools for Data-Centric AI by Ali Azhar on 2024-10-14](https://www.bigdatawire.com/2024/10/14/79578/)\nSnorkel AI recently announced updates to its flagship Snorkel Flow platform aimed at enhancing the customization of AI and ML models while minimizing the time, cost, and complexity involved in data preparation for enterprises.\n\nThe new functionality includes the ability to utilize GenAI for use-case-specific benchmarks, advanced named entity recognition (NER) for PDFs, fine-tuning workflows, AI ecosystem integrations, and more.\n\nWith the introduction of the new capabilities, Snorkel Flow seeks to provide comprehensive support for the entire AI data development life cycle, from data preparation and labeling to model evaluation and deployment.\n\nAI-ready data is critical for AI development, governance, and model validation. Enterprises must ensure they have not only sufficient data but also data that accurately reflects relevant patterns, errors, outliers, and unexpected elements from real-world applications. This approach enables them to leverage their unstructured and proprietary data effectively.\n\n“AI is at the top of every enterprise leader’s priority list, but the deep work needed for consistent, repeatable AI development is daunting, costly, and manual,” said Alex Ratner, CEO and co-founder of Snorkel AI.\n\n“Data underpins successful adoption of AI in large enterprises, which is why these updates to our AI data development platform are so important. They’re fundamental to helping enterprises accelerate and optimize the delivery of AI solutions.”\n\nSnorkel AI is a four-year-old startup based in Palo Alto, CA, that emerged from a data labeling project at the Stanford AI Lab. Researchers at the lab identified a market need for tools to automate data preparation, leading to the creation of the Snorkel framework and the eventual founding of Snorkel AI to commercialize this technology.\n\nSince its launch, Snorkel AI has been implemented in production environments by several Fortune 500 companies, including Wayfair, Chubb, and BNY Mellon.\n\nWhile competitors like Clarifai and Scale AI have introduced similar tools for managing the lifecycle of AI models, the main feature of SnorkelFlow is its capability for programmatic data labeling and development.\n\nSnorkel Flow claims that its latest update provides enterprises with a powerful platform for implementing and scaling AI data development practices, thereby speeding up the production of highly accurate, specialized AI models.\n\nAmong the key updates to the platform are LLM evaluation tools which allow users to customize assessments for specific domains and derive in-depth insights about performance, error modes, and data development needs.\n\nThe new release comes at a time when organizations face challenges with GenAI’s accuracy and scalability. Across sectors, there’s growing recognition of the need for high-quality, use-case-specific data to enhance the performance of LLMs.\n\nTraditional AI systems often struggle with retrieval accuracy and relevance, leading to inefficient responses and increased development time. Snorkel Flow aims to solve this by introducing enhanced RAG tuning workflows that improve retrieval accuracy through advanced chunking, metadata extraction, and embedding model fine-tuning.\n\nExtracting relevant information from complex PDF documents can be quite challenging and often involves considerable manual effort. Snorkel Flow tackles this issue with its new Named Entity Recognition (NER) feature, which simplifies and accelerates the process of information extraction from PDFs.\n\nAdditionally, this NER capability can be utilized for virtual assistants and GenAI chatbots by improving their ability to understand and retrieve specific information from documents.\n\nAccording to Snorkel AI, the new update offers a more efficient workflow for subject matter experts, allowing them to annotate data more easily. It also provides deeper integration with popular AI development tools like Amazon SageMaker and Databricks.\n\nThe new Spotlight Mode helps users identify model prediction errors in sequence tagging workflows, while class-level metrics offer deeper insights into performance. Other improvements include user experience (UI) enhancements to allow for smoother navigation and data labeling.\n\nEarlier this year, Snorkel AI announced a major update to Snorkel Flow focused on the integration of enterprise data with AI models. Building on that update, Snorkel Flow’s latest release addresses critical aspects of data readiness and model evaluation. It provides enterprises with a useful tool to leverage unstructured data effectively while improving workflows.\n\nAs enterprises focus on tailored AI solutions, the advancements in Snorkel Flow could impact how they approach the development and deployment of specialized models for specific business requirements.\n\nRelated Items\n\nSnorkel AI Heads into 2023 with Record Momentum and Growth\n\nAnalyze This: How to Prepare Your Unstructured Data in Six Steps",

      "# [Products, Competitors, Financials, Employees, Headquarters Locations](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/snorkelai)\nThe DeepSeek Moment\n\nThe DeepSeek Moment In the rapidly evolving world of AI, the arrival of DeepSeek-R1 marks a pivotal shift. We reached out to founders of five leading AI infrastructure companies in Greylock’s portfolio—Devvret Rishi (Predibase), Tuhin Srivastava (Baseten), Ankur Goyal (Braintrust), Jerry Liu (LlamaIndex), and Alex Ratner (Snorkel AI)—to get their take on DeepSeek and what it means for the future of open-source vs. closed models, AI infrastructure, and GenAI economics. Their insights reveal broad enthusiasm about the advancements DeepSeek brings, with some divergence in perspectives on its real-world impact. Open-Source vs. Closed Models: The Playing Field Has Leveled Historically, proprietary models like OpenAI’s were significantly ahead of open-source alternatives, often by 6-12 months. DeepSeek-R1 has fundamentally closed that gap, demonstrating performance on par with OpenAI’s latest offerings on key reasoning benchmarks, despite its smaller footprint. According to Rishi, “DeepSeek-R1 is a watershed moment for open-source AI. Historically, open-source models trailed proprietary models like OpenAI’s by 6-12 months. Now, DeepSeek-R1 has essentially closed that gap and is on par with OpenAI’s latest models on key reasoning benchmarks despite its smaller footprint.” He believes this is the inflection point where open-source begins to commoditize the model layer. Srivastava echoes this sentiment, stating, “DeepSeek as a moment changes everything. An open-source model is at the same level of quality as the SOTA closed-source models, which previously was not the case. Now with the cat out of the bag, all of the open-source models like Llama, Qwen, and Mistral will be soon to follow.” Goyal offers a more balanced perspective: “DeepSeek is the ‘LLaMa moment’ for O1-style (reasoning) models. In the very worst case, it means that the secret formula is out, and we’ll have a vibrant and competitive LLM market just like we did for GPT, Claude, and LLaMa-style models. In the best case, engineering teams will have a huge diversity of practical options, each with compute, cost, and performance trade-offs that enable them to solve a very wide variety of problems. In all cases, I think the world benefits from this progress.” Ratner echoes the above sentiments about open source and model diversity, focusing on the massive acceleration to enterprises specializing their own AI that this represents: “We’ve always viewed open source models as right behind- algorithms and model architectures rarely stay hidden for long. It was only a matter of time. However: it punctuates the exciting reality that enterprises will have a plethora of performant and cheap LLM options to then evaluate and specialize with their data and expertise, for their unique use cases. I expect DeepSeek to accelerate this trend of specialized enterprise AI massively.” AI Infrastructure and Developer Adoption: The Reinforcement Learning Revolution One of the most striking aspects of DeepSeek-R1 is its use of reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities. While RL-based LLM optimization has been explored for years, DeepSeek is the first open-source model to successfully implement it at scale with measurable gains, using a technique called Generalized Reinforcement Learning with Policy Optimization (GRPO). Rishi sees this as a game-changer, explaining, “DeepSeek’s most impactful contribution is proving that pure reinforcement learning can bootstrap advanced reasoning capabilities, as seen with their R1-Zero model.” However, he also notes a major gap: “Most ML teams have never trained reasoning models, and today’s AI tooling isn’t built to support this new paradigm.” Srivastava believes that DeepSeek marks an inflection point for AI infrastructure: “With DeepSeek, the moat of ‘we trained the biggest and best model, so we’re keeping it closed’ is gone. Now, you have a situation where frontier model-level quality is available in a model you completely control.” Ratner adds, “We are seeing the ‘AlphaGo moment’ for constrained, verifiable domains (e.g. math, basic coding- things that are simple and well defined to check for correctness), showing the power of LLMs + RL, and the rapid diffusion of algorithmic advancements.” However, he stresses that the next steps will involve expanding this success to more complex and less verifiable domains—a much longer and more challenging journey, involving much more human ingenuity and input. New Applications: AI Reasoning at Scale DeepSeek’s improved reasoning capabilities unlock a new wave of applications. Rishi highlights several emerging possibilities, including: Autonomous AI agents that refine their decision-making over time. Highly specialized planning systems in industries like finance, logistics, and healthcare. Enterprise AI assistants that dynamically adapt to user needs beyond rigid RAG-based solutions. AI-powered software engineering tools that can self-debug and optimize code based on performance feedback. Liu expands on this by discussing the implications for GPU demand and agentic applications: “DeepSeek does not mean that there will be less demand for GPU compute; on the contrary, I’m quite excited because I think it will significantly accelerate the demand and adoption of agentic applications. One of the core issues with building any agent that ‘actually works’ is reliability, speed, and cost—robust agent applications that can e2e automate knowledge workflows require reasoning loops that repeatedly make LLM inference calls. The more general/capable the agent is, the more reasoning loops it requires. While the O1/O3 series of models have impressive reasoning capabilities, they are way too cost prohibitive to use for more general agents. Faster/cheaper models incentivize the development of more general agents that can solve more tasks, which in turn leads to greater demand and adoption across more people and teams.” Srivastava emphasizes, “There are big implications from DeepSeek and the subsequent models that will follow for highly regulated industries. Companies that have strict data compliance requirements will be able to more freely experiment and innovate knowing that they can completely control how data is used and where it’s sent.” Ratner underscores that data remains the real edge: “R1-style progress relies on strong pre/post-training in the relevant domains and rigorous evaluation data before the RL magic kicks in.” He further explains, “Many things in GenAI today effectively reduce to really high-quality, domain-specific labeling, including reinforcement learning. DeepSeek’s results reiterate the point that if you have a good way to label (i.e. a “reward function”), you can do magic; but in most domains, it’s not so easy to get the data or label it.” Economics of GenAI: The Cost Equation Changes DeepSeek accelerates the trend toward cheaper, more efficient inference and post-training, significantly altering the economics of GenAI deployment. Rishi points to Jevon’s Paradox: “As LLMs become cheaper and more efficient, enterprises won’t just replace proprietary APIs with open-source models—they’ll use AI even more, fine-tuning and deploying multiple domain-specific models instead of relying on a single general-purpose one.” Srivastava emphasizes the financial impact, stating, “A reasoning model like R1 will be as much as 7x cheaper than using an OpenAI or Anthropic. Having a model with those economics unlocks many use cases that previously may not have been financially viable or attractive for most enterprises, which are yet to come meaningfully online with Gen AI. Ratner adds, “As the generators become more powerful and commoditized—it’s all about labeling! Whether it’s RLHF, heuristic methods like DeepSeek-R1’s reward functions, or advanced hybrid approaches, defining the acceptance function to match the distribution we want is the logical next step.” DeepSeek is undeniably a milestone in the AI industry, marking the first time an open-source model has reached true competitive parity with proprietary alternatives. Rishi and Srivastava see it as a fundamental shift, ushering in a new era of AI development where companies can fully control high-performing models while benefiting from the economic advantages of open-source. Goyal, however, remains skeptical of its real-world adoption so far, viewing it more as a pricing lever against incumbents than an immediate replacement. Ratner reinforces that while DeepSeek represents meaningful progress, much of the future of AI hinges on high-quality, domain-specific data and labeling. He concludes, “Whether you see it as a paradigm shift or just another step in the AI arms race, its impact on the industry is undeniable.” From Idea to Iconic.",
      "# [Meta's big, expensive AI bet hinges on giving its models away for free by Angela Yang on 2024-04-26](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/metas-big-expensive-ai-bet-hinges-giving-models-away-free-rcna149426)\nMeta is spending big on artificial intelligence — only to offer its latest advanced AI models to the public for free.\n\nThe tech giant recently announced the rollout of Llama 3, the open-code large language model that underpins the Meta AI assistant tool now widely accessible on its flagship social media platforms. Meta aimed to “build the best open models that are on par with the best proprietary models available today,” it wrote in a blog post.\n\nThe model quickly drew acclaim from technologists — but not from investors.\n\nMeta stock plummeted Wednesday after CEO Mark Zuckerberg touted a slew of money-losing projects on its first-quarter earnings call. Zuckerberg expressed confidence in investing even further in advanced open-source AI models.\n\n“I’m very pleased with how Llama 3 has come together so far,” he said on the earnings call, adding, “I expect our models are just going to improve further from open-source contributions.”\n\n“Open source” is generally used to describe software that is made available to the public, which can use the code and improve it or build on it. Several rapidly growing AI startups, such as Mistral AI and Hugging Face, have found success offering open-source models and tools.\n\nIn AI, models — such as large language models and foundational models — are the complex pieces of software that use algorithms, trained on relevant data, to complete tasks that include recognizing patterns and making predictions or decisions. OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and many more companies are constantly developing, training and tweaking their models seeking to create ever more capable AI programs.\n\nSo what’s the catch? Why would Meta spend so much time and money developing AI models only to make them open source?\n\nAlex Ratner, CEO of the data-focused company Snorkel AI and an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington, wrote in an email that Llama 3 is a “much bigger step change than many people realize.” He said he suspects it will benefit AI developers en masse while also enabling Meta to reduce costs, attract talent and boost potential revenue.\n\nWhen a business or an organization wants to integrate AI technologies into its operations, it must use its own internal data to properly tune those AI models. But using closed-source models means giving that data — often the most valuable company asset — away to an AI model provider who ultimately owns the final model.\n\nUsing a model like Llama 3, however, gives those enterprises a way to maintain ownership of their own data, as well as the output of their work. That makes using open-source models much more appealing to developers and data scientists, he wrote, possibly giving Meta better chances to attract top talent in the AI space.\n\n“Enterprise AI is becoming less about the biggest, most powerful generalist model, and more about the specialist trained on your data,” Ratner wrote, “and Meta has positioned Llama 3 to potentially become the epicenter of that.”\n\nOthers in the tech community have offered similar assessments. Bindu Reddy, CEO of the generative AI startup Abacus.AI, said recently on X that Meta’s move with Llama was “a strategic masterstroke and serves its business interests.”\n\nAaron Levie, CEO of the cloud computing company Box, said on X: “Incredible to have Meta out here pushing open source AI forward in such a major way. An amazing moment to be building software when you have $100s of billions of dollars from the major tech players going into advanced R&D and infra that directly benefit you as a developer.”\n\nUnlike many of its fellow tech giants, Meta has a history of investing in open-source projects, from the machine learning library PyTorch to the JavaScript library React to the data query language GraphQL, among others. Its earlier iterations of Llama were also advertised as open source.\n\nBut there are limits to Llama’s openness.\n\nWhile Meta allows most developers to use Llama 3 commercially, those who seek to use it in products with more than 700 million monthly active users — essentially, just major tech platforms such as Google, TikTok and Snapchat — must request licenses from Meta. It also has not disclosed the data used to train Llama 2 and 3, which makes it hard to gauge potential bias.\n\nAnd the company’s license for Llama 3 is not approved by the Open Source Initiative, a widely recognized nonprofit authority that sets rules defining open-source software, which makes labeling Meta’s LLM “open source” somewhat controversial in tech spaces.\n\nStill, Zuckerberg laid out in another earnings call this year that Meta has strategic interests in positioning itself as a leader in open-source software infrastructure. Not only is open-source software a more popular option among developers and researchers, he said, but such software is also more likely to become an industry standard.\n\nThe advantage with closed-source AI models — like OpenAI’s GPT, Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini — is that the AI providers behind the LLMs retain more control over their proprietary algorithms and technologies, making it harder for competitors to replicate them. But Zuckerberg has said he is not worried.\n\n“The short version is that open sourcing improves our models,” Zuckerberg said on the call. “And because there’s still significant work to turn our models into products and because there will be other open-source models available anyway, we find there are mostly advantages to being the open-source leader, and it doesn’t remove differentiation from our products much anyway.”",

It has been a privilege to lead this creative company for the last 9 years. I am happy to transfer leadership of MasterPeace to someone as capable and accomplished as Joe. I look forward to seeing Joe and the team build on our foundation of innovation and create new paths for growth as they leverage and continue our investments in technology and employee experience. I’m also excited about the continued collaboration with Joe, Steve, and MasterPeace as I transition to a new phase in my career, and ongoing participation with MasterPeace technology spinouts.\"\n\nFinally, Joe Pacileo commented, \"MasterPeace Solutions represents a very unique and robust set of engineering opportunities, focused on leading-edge technology vectors, that can serve both public and private sectors. It’s truly an honor and a privilege to be joining such a highly capable and successful team.”\n\nJoe Pacileo will assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer-elect on August 21, 2023, and will work with Drew Cohen through the end of December on a transition of duties. On January 1, 2024, Joe Pacileo will become the Company Chief Executive Officer. At that time, Drew Cohen will become the Chief Product Officer of Zuul, Inc. and AI Wingman, Inc. (both are MasterPeace Solutions’ technology spin-off companies).\n\nDrew Cohen, President & CEO of MasterPeace, will be speaking at RSA 2020 on a panel titled, “Putting Access Management for the Internet of Things into Practice with MUD.” The panel discussion will summarize the various public and private sector methods for documenting and applying the top security practices for IoT. Additionally, industry collaborations exploring the implementation of Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) Specification (RFC 8520) will be discussed.\n\n“MUD makes it possible for manufacturers to define ‘device intent,’ allowing network security vendors to use that information to ensure ‘safe’ network conditions,” said Drew Cohen, President & CEO of MasterPeace Solutions. “Working with NIST and others, our Yikes! startup has demonstrated how MUD-enabled products create opportunities that change the landscape for secure device management on small business and consumer networks. MUD allows security automation to be built into consumer and small business networking products, to establish the appropriate security policies for each device, and decrease the threat surface, without complex system administration.”\n\nDuring the discussion, Drew will elaborate on these topics and, with other panelists, speak about the collaboration between the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST), MasterPeace, Arm, CableLabs, Cisco, CTIA, DigiCert, ForeScout, Global Cyber Alliance, Molex, Patton Electronics, and Symantec, who are all working towards solutions that will make it harder for threat actors to exploit IoT devices used by both homes and small businesses. Many of these IoT devices have software flaws that can be easily compromised by threat actors. To combat this, the partnership has published a practice guide titled, Securing Small-Business and Home Internet of Things (IoT) Devices: Mitigating Network-Based Attacks Using Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD), a free description of solutions and practical steps that consumers and small businesses can use to mitigate these IoT-based threats.\n\nJoining Drew on this panel are:\n\nProfessor L. Jean Camp from Indiana University\n\nEliot Lear, Principal Engineer of Cisco-Enterprise Chief Technology Office\n\nMudumbai Ranganathan, Computer Engineer from NIST\n\nDarshak Thakore, Principal Architect of CableLabs\n\nThe panel will take place February 27, 8:00am to 8:50am at Moscone West.

MasterPeace’s program is modeled after the Lean LaunchPad start-up Business and Engineering school class taught at Stanford University, based on a methodology created by entrepreneur Steve Blank to support the launch of commercially focused technology companies.\n\n​\n\nLed by Director of LaunchPad Operations, William Olsen, this program covers all the technical and business aspects required to transform a startup concept into a viable commercial business, rather than just coaching cohort members on giving fundraising pitches or product demos. Last year’s 2018 graduates of the MasterPeace LaunchPad program created new companies including Yikes, which has contributed network security, engineering, and operations defense expertise to the NIST-led consortium for Mitigating IoT-Based DDoS, and Zuul, currently deploying national transportation market solutions for securing connected devices and payment systems. Another cohort from last year’s class, FactChain, will officially launch and begin selling product in the fall of 2019.\n\n​\n\n“MasterPeace LaunchPad is diversifying Maryland’s economic base by leveraging its Cyber and Technology talent pool to create new product companies and career opportunities for engineers who have previously focused on the Government Contracting sector,” said Drew Cohen, MasterPeace President and CEO. “We are glad to have the opportunity to support this new group of talented individuals and are eager to continue providing a platform for our engineers to create and launch new product companies.”\n\n​\n\nThe five new SpinCo teams that comprise MasterPeace LaunchPad’s 2019 cohort class, some of which may turn into commercial companies that ultimately “spin out”, are working to build businesses that deliver unique technology to the marketplace. Two examples of the new startup’s offerings are described below:\n\n​\n\nElectraZoom, an IoT enablement platform and device toolkit that provides one click onboarding of IoT devices into a mixed vendor/device environment. The ElectraZoom platform controls, manages, and monitors devices in a consistent manner, and is able to perform functions and interoperate in a network of heterogenous IoT devices. Users pick the IoT device they want and are not locked into what is available from a single manufacturer. The platform supports industrial enterprises in implementing machine learning, surveillance, factory automation, and more.\n\n​\n\nDataLocker, developed by LaunchPad’s Uplift Portfolio Service team as their first AWS service, offers PII-Data-Management-as-a-service to manage and store encrypted PII and HIPAA data to ensure that if a company is breached, critical information is not taken in the process. Advanced analytics monitor and block queries that are potentially malicious, alerting the SOC/CIRT and identifying the potential threat before the data loss. This reduces risk and cost, and will be an AWS marketplace service that can be easily added to existing AWS solutions. With a few simple configuration settings, this capability can be engaged and a company’s critical PII data is secured.\n\n​\n\nFollowing the completion of the LaunchPad Program, each company will showcase their technology at Demo Day in early February 2020. MasterPeace’s 2018 Demo Day included attendees such as Maryland Lieutenant Governor, Boyd Rutherford, and Howard County Executive, Calvin Ball.\n\n​\n\n“From our Innovation Center to the locally-based MasterPeace LaunchPad, Howard County is on the cutting edge of economic growth. By creating a culture that welcomes new businesses, leverages our strategic location, and utilizes our talented workforce, our community continues to be a land of opportunity,” said Howard County Executive, Calvin Ball. “I congratulate the new cohort class at MasterPeace and look forward to the innovative business ideas they are sure to create.”\n\n​\n\nRead more\n\nMasterPeace LaunchPad hosted its 3rd annual Demo Day, which took place on Wednesday, December 5th. Attendees were joined by a notable group of state and local influencers and industry speakers, including Lt. Governor Boyd Rutherford, Howard County Executive Calvin Ball, and former Tenable CEO/Chairman Ron Gula, to discuss the growing Maryland Cyber startup eco-system. The Zuul IoT, FactChain, Uplift and newly unveilved Yikes! startup teams treated attendees to demonstrations of four products taking shape in the MasterPeace LaunchPad accelerator. MasterPeace leadership also provided some insights into how it is helping these startups put Lean LaunchPad methodologies into practice, including a virtual shout out from Lean LaunchPad creator and author Steve Blank.\n\nThe discussion highlighted the significant progress MasterPeace has made as it leverages the region's engineering talent to contribute to Central Maryland's development as a hub of commercial technology innovation. The four startup products on display also showcased the breadth of MasterPeace LaunchPad's development approach, which utilizes a broad range of cutting-edge technologies including IoT PKI, Blockchain, AWS Lambdas, and Software Defined Networking and Micro-nets.\n\nAs MasterPeace CEO Drew Cohen put it, “The key to MasterPeace LaunchPad’s success is our talent. The Columbia area is a world class resource for cyber and engineering talent, but the vast majority of that talent is deployed in Federal Government or Commercial services companies. MasterPeace LaunchPad provides a platform for those individuals to create and launch new product companies, scale the impact of their skills to a global market and become an engine for the region’s continued economic growth. This is the reason key state and county officials like Lt. Gov. Rutherford and County Executive Ball, along with proven Cyber entrepreneurs like Ron Gula, are willing to take time from their business schedules to support our startups.”",
