      "# [Edge Threat Management – Arista by Arista - Edge Threat Management on 2014-11-04](https://edge.arista.com/solutions/hospitality/)\nProviding a High Level of Service Cost-Effectively\n\nWi-Fi is now the top amenity customers want. It’s mandatory for businesses to provide a high level of service cost-effectively. While most hospitality organizations have deployed Wi-Fi, having it available is just the first step. Ensuring a secure and reliable Internet connection for all users is the real difference between Wi-Fi being a success or failure.\n\nWith Edge Threat Management, providing a secure and reliable wireless connection is simple and the benefits are clear. Customers will have the convenience to safely go online wherever they are located on the property. Basic Internet access can be provided for free, and if higher bandwidth is needed, tiered service offerings can be made available. For back-office operations, businesses can prioritize Internet traffic for reservation systems, administration tools, point-of-sale and more to provide a high level of service regardless of where the transaction occurs.\n\nContact Sales\n\nContact Sales for Hospitality & Retail\n\nMobile payments, including ApplePay, GooglePay, and CashApp have become increasingly popular among shoppers and retailers alike. Customers gain the ease of use by paying for their purchases with their mobile device, and retailers can declutter their payment station with streamlined payment terminals. However, protecting these transactions is crucial.\n\nAs a small business preparing for an influx in mobile payment technologies, securing your network is critical. With Edge Threat Management’s multifaceted security solution, retail owners and employees can provide their customers with streamlined, and protected purchases both online and in person.",
      "# [Edge Threat Management – Arista by Arista - Edge Threat Management on 2019-10-15](https://edge.arista.com/micro-edge/)\nBranch Office Connectivity\n\nMicro Edge appliances feature WiFi and LTE connectivity (AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon), Fiber, and multiple WAN ports to provide multiple Internet paths that automatically fail over to eliminate downtime. Securely connect distributed enterprises and remote workers using IPsec VPN, OpenVPN and WireGuardⓇ VPN.\n\nApplication Based Optimization\n\nOptimal predictive path selection technology incorporates a sophisticated cloud component to identify applications at the first packet. This advanced technology enables Micro Edge software to choose the best path for specific applications or categories of network traffic.\n\nEdge Optimization\n\nDeploying Micro Edge at a branch office boosts Internet connectivity with traffic shaping and QoS to prioritize business critical traffic. Real-time performance monitoring with WAN balancing leverages the performance and cost savings of inexpensive Internet connections to eliminate the need for expensive dedicated links such as MPLS.\n\nCloud-based Centralized Management\n\nNetwork administrators using ETM Dashboard gain full visibility of all their NG Firewall and Micro Edge deployments. Cloud-based ETM Dashboard enables you to view appliance network status and location, important events, and reporting data. Configure and push policy templates, WAN rules, and global configuration. Simplify deployment of multiple appliances by connecting appliances with auto-provisioning VPN.\n\nZero Touch Provisioning\n\nUsing ETM Dashboard, network administrators or MSPs can remotely set up and configure single or multiple Micro Edge deployments without having to be on site. Automatic upgrades ensure the latest security updates and enhancements.\n\nSecurity and Threat Prevention\n\nMicro Edge has a stateful firewall, Threat Prevention, Geo-IP Filter and Web Filter which blocks traffic that can cause harm to your network. Encrypted traffic is a hotspot for hackers to hide malware or other malicious code. However, Threat Prevention, Geo-IP Filter and Web Filter can make an assessment even if the traffic is encrypted and block harmful files or transmissions before they get onto the network.",

      "# [Edge Threat Management – Arista by Arista - Edge Threat Management on 2016-02-10](https://edge.arista.com/shop/ssl-inspector/)\nMore and more Internet traffic is being encrypted using HTTPS, which creates a huge blindspot for firewalls. It compromises their ability to analyze traffic, identify threats or handle policy violations.\n\nSSL Inspector solves this problem. Whether it is driven by concerns about personal privacy, or the rise of web applications like Salesforce, Netflix and Facebook, the amount of encrypted Internet traffic has exploded. SSL Inspector puts NG Firewall in the middle of the encrypted traffic, with the ability to decrypt and analyze the data as it passes through.\n\nSSL Inspector creates a specialized certificate on each client. This certificate communicates directly with the gateway which is then able to decrypt HTTPS and SMTP traffic, process, and re-encrypt it on the fly all from within NG Firewall—without ever exposing the decrypted traffic to the network. This enables HTTPS traffic to be inspected in the same way as regular HTTP traffic, meaning that all NG Firewall apps and their rules can be applied.",

      "# [Micro Edge Release Highlights by Arista - Edge Threat Management on 2020-04-15](https://edge.arista.com/micro-edge/release/)\nVersion 5.0 Highlights\n\nVersion 5.0 Highlights\n\nMicro Edge 5.0 includes Application Control, Event Reporting and additional improvements to increase network efficiency.\n\nApplication Control builds on the existing classification and routing capabilities by giving administrators a simplified view of all applications with the ability to allow or block applications with a click.\n\nEvent Reporting logs events in ETM Dashboard such as WAN link down, VPN link down, new VPN link set up, low memory, available upgrades, etc. Administrators can set up notifications or alerts for Micro Edge events in ETM Dashboard.\n\nPlease refer to the release notes for more information.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nMicro Edge version 5.0 is available as a free upgrade to customers with a paid subscription.\n\nVersion 4.3 Highlights\n\nDevice Visibility\n\nDevice visibility allows administrators to easily see a list of the devices (a.k.a. clients) that are connected to the network. This visibility allows administrators to see in real-time what devices are on the network. As the attack surface expands with more IoT devices and users connecting with their personal devices (BYOD), admins need to know as much as possible about the devices connected on the network.\n\nGeo-IP Filter\n\nGeo-IP Filter, also known as geo-blocking, allows administrators to filter traffic by country, and can block traffic to or from a geographic location. Specific countries can be allowed if needed. This security feature provides an additional layer of security and control for network administrators.\n\nDHCP Relay\n\nFor enterprises with many distributed networks, admins may prefer to centrally manage IP assignment via DHCP. In this scenario, each network must be capable of forwarding DHCP requests to a central server via VPN tunnels or dedicated links such as MPLS.\n\nPlease refer to the release notes for more information.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nMicro Edge version 4.3 is available as a free upgrade to customers with a paid subscription. Device Discoverability and Geo-IP Filter is included in the Micro Edge Security software package.\n\nVersion 4.2 Highlights\n\nIPsec VPN\n\nMicro Edge is a lightweight device that extends the network reach to the very edge, and now with IPsec VPN provides a wide variety of connectivity options. In addition to OpenVPN and WireGuard VPN connectivity options, IPsec VPN gives network administrators more flexibility when deploying Micro Edge appliances in their network. IPsec VPN uses the advanced WAN routing capabilities of Micro Edge, so you can leverage the tunnel for routing based on link performance and availability, applications, protocols, networks, and other criteria.\n\nOther updates include support for Japanese and German languages, OpenWrt operating system update, the ability to deploy in the European ETM Dashboard, and updated branding.\n\nPlease see the changelog for a full list of updates in Micro Edge 4.2.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nMicro Edge version 4.2 is available as a free upgrade to customers with a paid subscription.\n\nVersion 4.0 Highlights\n\nWeb Filter\n\nMicro Edge 4.0 (formerly SD-WAN Router) is a lightweight device that extends the network reach to the very perimeter. Micro Edge with Web Filter, provides additional security for networks that need it at branch offices. Web Filter, powered by Webroot BrightcloudⓇ, performs a real-time assessment of the site and blocks access to dangerous, inappropriate or distracting website content to protect the network and increase employee productivity. Web Filter, paired with Threat Prevention, provides multiple layers of security at the network edge.\n\nAdditional updates include performance improvements, nightly automatic configuration backups, and the ability to add static routes for local networks that reside behind other routers on the local network which helps admins who manage segmented networks at branch locations.\n\nPlease see the changelog for a full list of updates in Micro Edge 4.0.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nMicro Edge version 4.0 is available as a free upgrade to customers with a paid subscription.\n\nWeb Filter is included in the Micro Edge Security software package.\n\nVersion 3.1 Highlights\n\nThreat Prevention\n\nThreat Prevention brings a new layer of security to SD-WAN Router that blocks high risk Internet traffic using the Webroot BrightCloud® reputation score associated with the server hosting the service. The reputation score looks at a web page, web page associations and files to determine the likelihood that an IP address may be associated with spam, malware, spyware, web attacks, botnets and other cyber threats. Threat Prevention doesn’t rely on decrypting traffic from secure sites, so it is an efficient and effective tool to prevent cyber attacks even when the data is encrypted.\n\nNew Software Packages\n\nWith the introduction of Threat Prevention, we are now offering two software subscription packages. The entry level or Basic Package includes all of the features of SD-WAN Router to connect, optimize and provide continuity to all your locations. The Security Package adds a new level of security to your network with Threat Prevention. Both packages are available on all the eSeries hardware appliances offered by Untangle.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nSD-WAN Router Basic Package starts at $162/yr. USD, and SD-WAN Router Security Package starts at $260/yr. USD. View the online store for complete pricing and purchasing options.\n\nSD-WAN Router will automatically upgrade to new versions if Automatic Upgrades are turned on, which is the recommended setting. Otherwise, upgrades can be performed from Command Center or through the local web administration. See Upgrading your Untangle SD-WAN Router for more details.\n\nView the online store for complete pricing options.\n\nVersion 3.0 Highlights\n\nUntangle SD-WAN Router 3.0 includes the ability to use WireGuard® VPN which will enable administrators to connect remote locations to NG Firewall or other devices that support WireGuard VPN, via a secure and performant connection. Other updates include adding LTE support for AT&T, improved DHCP server management, ability to manage NIC media speed, and more.\n\nWireGuard VPN\n\nThis new VPN option is easy to implement and increases performance when connecting SD-WAN Router to a network. WireGuard uses state-of-the-art cryptography to secure user networks and delivers fast, performant connectivity, designed for ease-of-implementation and simplicity of configuration. Client-to-site network connectivity is simple to set up with an easy copy and paste between servers.\n\nAT&T LTE\n\nUntangle SD-WAN Router has achieved certification by AT&T to use the provider for LTE services. This improves the ability of SD-WAN Router to provide reliable internet connectivity to remote offices or branches that have unreliable or limited internet service. Users can select AT&T as the LTE provider on the SD-WAN Router e6wl appliance. Untangle SD-WAN Router is now certified to use any of the major carriers in the U.S. (AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon).\n\nPlease see the changelog for a full list of updates in SD-WAN Router 3.0.\n\n“WireGuard” and the “WireGuard” logo are registered trademarks of Jason A.

      "# Post ID 1eyl31e: Cisco vs. Arista Maintenance & Renewals—Which is Better? with +8 score by [(Owlytica, Reddit, 2024-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/1eyl31e/cisco_vs_arista_maintenance_renewalswhich_is/)\nHey everyone, I’m curious about how Cisco’s maintenance and renewal processes compare to Arista’s. With Cisco, we have Smartnet for maintenance and warranties, but I’ve noticed some ongoing issues. For example, Cisco’s records can be inaccurate, leading to situations where they try to renew more maintenance than what the customer actually owns.\n\nAnother challenge is the disconnect between Cisco DNA licensing and the associated hardware, especially when a customer has an Enterprise Agreement (EA). When renewals come around, Cisco sometimes charges based on what’s been downloaded rather than what’s been consumed, which can be frustrating.\n\nI’m wondering if Arista has similar challenges, or if their maintenance and renewals process is more straightforward. Is Arista easier—or perhaps even harder—to manage from a maintenance and renewals perspective? Cisco has the Ready Report to export records, but it’s often outdated and inaccurate. Does Arista deal with these kinds of issues as well?\n\nWould love to hear your experiences\n\n## Comment ID ljdyg0e with +18 score by [(sryan2k1, Reddit, 2024-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/1eyl31e/cisco_vs_arista_maintenance_renewalswhich_is/ljdyg0e/) (in reply to ID 1eyl31e):\nArista has about 5 license levels that are all very clearly laid out about what features require what licenses.\n\n[https://www.arista.com/en/support/product-documentation/eos-feature-licensing/eos-platform-licensing](https://www.arista.com/en/support/product-documentation/eos-feature-licensing/eos-platform-licensing)\n\nNo licensing is mandatory (Base is included with the price of the device), there is no on box licensing (all honor based) Edit - Apparently MACSec is enforced, I assume due to legal/regulatory reasons though and not because they really wanted to. \n\n\n\nThe renewals are single line item SKUs priced per month with the quantity needed for each model/coverage type. (For example if you have two 7280R3's with 4 hour support and 10 720XPs with NBD you'd have a line item for 7280R3 - 4 Hour quantity 24 (2 units \\* 12 months) and another line item for 720XP NBD quantity 120, assuming you're buying in year chunks)\n\nYou tell me what you think is better.\n\n### Comment ID ljfgvv1 with +4 score by [(beskone, Reddit, 2024-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/1eyl31e/cisco_vs_arista_maintenance_renewalswhich_is/ljfgvv1/) (in reply to ID ljdyg0e):\nArista is pretty much Base or L3 Advanced + Support\n\nand even then L3 Advanced is honor system.

That is if you are on a budget then Arista might not be your first choice (on the other hand neither will Cisco, Juniper and a few others either).\n\n- Can be somewhat tricky to find out what is the most optimal model for your usecase since there are many variants of each model. Its not like back in the days where you had Cisco 29xx for L2-switching, 35xx for L3-switching and 65xx for chassibased L3 and thats it.

These have been concentrated on the EX side, but some of them are just so dumb - like committing a configuration interrupting the STP process.  I've also seen multiple bugs where STP-blocked ports are permitted to pass traffic as well as bugs that have broken split horizon.  When I've run into unresolved bugs too, the timeline for getting a fix is long, and communicating with the developers requires jumping through so many hoops.  MX issues have been fewer (and mostly related to the quirks of our environment hitting hardware limitations), but notably we once got bad guidance from JTAC on the expected behavior of a MX linecard when it runs out of memory - they told us the changes just wouldn't happen, but it actually crashes.  I give Juniper a pass on that one though - most people don't try to push their hardware like we do.  Arista on the other hand hasn't caused any major issues for us in years; the only one I'm aware of was before my time.

Arista solves this by doing IP fabrics or large chassises in the closet.   I don't know about this.

I believe that stacking will die off in about 10 years.\n\nThere are two vendors doing just that.  Arista and Extreme.\n\nHowever, IP fabrics and BGP/VxLAN in the campus are complex.  Not everyone is going to do it with automation as the software overlay will be licensed.  \n\nI have been in this game for 20 years and I find that everyone talks a good game but people rarely execute when it comes to automation.   I have seen it countless times where orgs have this huge L3 BGP/MPLS design right to the campus edge.  In the end they just have their stackable switches in L2 mode.\n\n### Comment ID hysmapt with +2 score by [(Bluecobra, Reddit, 2022-02-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/t2pidy/advice_on_arista_and_juniper_2022/hysmapt/) (in reply to ID hypajx1):\nI don't think Arista will ever support stacking:\n\nhttps://www.arista.com/assets/data/pdf/Whitepapers/Architectures-Stackable-Switch-WP.pdf\n\nI'm with Arista on this one, having a distribution layer with MLAG is super stable AND scalable and I would prefer that anyway vs. learning the nuances of <insert_vendor_here> weird stacking requirements/limitations.\n\n#### Comment ID hyt70lt with +3 score by [(SDN_stilldoesnothing, Reddit, 2022-02-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/t2pidy/advice_on_arista_and_juniper_2022/hyt70lt/) (in reply to ID hysmapt):\nI have seen that Arista white paper before.

Cisco, on the other hand, feels more like four separate entities loosely held together by red tape and bubblegum. They flail along seemingly aimless, occasionally losing a piece of the shambling giant, only to replace it with another ill-fitting and poorly attached replacement. I don't hate Cisco products (except the ASA), but I do dislike their licensing, their lack of a competent firewall option, and the biggest issue for me: acquisitions over innovation.\r  \n\r  \nCisco was unbelievably far ahead of their competitors, but they seemed to prioritize money over everything else. One example of this is their approach to EIGRP, an amazing routing protocol that they kept closed off until the point where most rational people wouldn't consider it in their environment, even if they are using all Cisco products. This is because they realize they might one day want to use something other than Cisco. Then, after everyone is done with it, they open-source it, displaying its cold carcass for all to peer into and say, 'Hmm, that could have worked.'\r  \n\r  \nThey did many things well and were pioneers in building the industry we work in today.

Cisco historically has created many proprietary protocols to keep their customers in the Cisco eco system. (cdp, eigrp, fabricpath to name a few).\n\nThis is quite a bit of a misrepresentation of Cisco.\n\nCisco developed IGRP in the mid-80s because RIP was too limiting with the 15 hop distance. OSPF first RFC was 1989. EIGRP evolved from IGRP in 1993 because IGRP only supported classful routing. Cisco supports all these protocols.\n\nCDP 1994. LLDP 2005. Cisco supports both.\n\nFabricPath - same data plane structure as the standard TRILL, released before TRILL had a completed control plane standard (so the switching ASICs would be able to forward either in hardware). Unfortunately, TRILL was DOA due to the emergence and adoption of VXLAN.\n\nHSRP came out before VRRP, Cisco supports both.\n\nPAgP came out before LACP, Cisco supports both.\n\nBasically, Cisco has historically developed many capabilities now taken for granted to differentiate and offer features they saw the market needed, and **did not otherwise exist**. They then sat on or contributed to many standards working groups to develop open standards in conjunction with other vendors and industry contributors.\n\nAs a result, they support both. Original proprietary protocols because there may be some systems that still use those today and don’t want to migrate; and industry standard implementations for cross vendor compatibility.\n\nCisco is no angel. Arista is doing amazing things and I love their business model, they would be my primary choice in the data centre and would be a top vendor for evaluation in campus. But Cisco has developed a lot of the features that are standards today before they existed anywhere, then helped develop and define equivalent standards.\n\n#### Comment ID jqleez0 with +3 score by [(element9261, Reddit, 2023-07-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/144wdg5/arista_vs_cisco/jqleez0/) (in reply to ID jnifh6r):\nWhat a great post, love the history here.\n\n#### Comment ID jniky6h with +1 score by [(Golle, Reddit, 2023-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/144wdg5/arista_vs_cisco/jniky6h/) (in reply to ID jnifh6r):\nThanks for clarifying!\n\n### Comment ID jni0bh4 with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/144wdg5/arista_vs_cisco/jni0bh4/) (in reply to ID jnhwvjf):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID jni26he with +4 score by [(Golle, Reddit, 2023-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/144wdg5/arista_vs_cisco/jni26he/) (in reply to ID jni0bh4):\nI wasn't denying that Cisco is also using Linux as its underlying OS.

They don't even have a company cafeteria to avoid paying for a $20 lunch. There goes $2k of your already meager salary down the drain! On paper we have \"Unlimited PTO\" but your coworkers and managers make it very clear not to take more than 4 weeks or there will be consequences in your next performance review.\n\nPurposefully opaque swe levels so that the company can underpay everyone! The only purpose of having your coworkers review you is so that this company can advertise this as a benefit to fool you into working for a very low compensation level while the execs run out the back with all the money! \n\nSpeaking of execs, don't be fooled by Kenneth Duda's high and mighty speeches about good software; remember that you will be paid pennies to write that good software for him while he sits in his giant study of his mansion and preaches about it to you on a regular basis.\n\nThere is no such thing as company pride here. All of the company events are cheap and nobody even shows up to them. There are 2 types of employees at arista: the recent ones stuck here like me and the decade long employees getting at least 20x my salary thanks to stock appreciation since they joined. The only reason why anyone from the last few years is here is because they couldn't get into company X Y or Z that they actually wanted to get into. I have yet to meet anyone young at this company that is \"proud\" to work here or genuinely wanted to work here.\n\nOverall, I would only work here as a last resort to keep from starving on the streets. Always spend the extra time you have from working less than 8 hours on finding a better company because you will not have enough money to do any interesting hobby to make your life fulfilling.",

You will never afford a house that you can call home that is within a reasonable commute distance to work, forget about it!

They don't even have a company cafeteria to avoid paying for a $20 lunch. There goes $2k of your already meager salary down the drain! On paper we have \"Unlimited PTO\" but your coworkers and managers make it very clear not to take more than 4 weeks or there will be consequences in your next performance review.\n\nPurposefully opaque swe levels so that the company can underpay everyone! The only purpose of having your coworkers review you is so that this company can advertise this as a benefit to fool you into working for a very low compensation level while the execs run out the back with all the money! \n\nSpeaking of execs, don't be fooled by Kenneth Duda's high and mighty speeches about good software; remember that you will be paid pennies to write that good software for him while he sits in his giant study of his mansion and preaches about it to you on a regular basis.\n\nThere is no such thing as company pride here. All of the company events are cheap and nobody even shows up to them. There are 2 types of employees at arista: the recent ones stuck here like me and the decade long employees getting at least 20x my salary thanks to stock appreciation since they joined. The only reason why anyone from the last few years is here is because they couldn't get into company X Y or Z that they actually wanted to get into. I have yet to meet anyone young at this company that is \"proud\" to work here or genuinely wanted to work here.\n\nOverall, I would only work here as a last resort to keep from starving on the streets.

      "# [Arista Introduces Intelligent Innovations for AI Networking by Arista Networks, Whitney Sisler on 2025-03-13](https://www.arista.com/en/company/news/press-release/21271-pr-20250312)\nEOS Smart AI Suite fuels peak AI workload performance\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif.– Mar 12, 2025—Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET), a leading innovator in cloud and AI networking, today introduced advanced capabilities to maximize AI cluster performance and efficiency. Cluster Load Balancing (CLB) in Arista EOS® maximizes AI workload performance with consistent, low-latency network flows, while Arista CloudVision® Universal Network Observability™ (CV UNO™) now offers AI job-centric observability for enhanced troubleshooting and rapid issue inference ensuring job completion reliability at scale.\n\nPowering Smart AI Networking\n\nThe Arista EOS Smart AI Suite is designed for AI-grade robustness and protection and empowers AI clusters with an innovation called Cluster Load Balancing — a new Ethernet-based AI load balancing solution based on RDMA queue pairs that enables high bandwidth utilization between spines and leaves. AI clusters usually have low quantities of large bandwidth flows. Basic load balancing methods are often inefficient for AI workloads, resulting in uneven traffic distribution and increased tail latency. CLB addresses this by using RDMA-aware flow placement, to ensure uniform high performance for all flows while keeping tail latency low. CLB takes a global approach, optimizing traffic flow in both directions, leaf-to-spine and spine-to-leaf, ensuring balanced utilization and consistent low latency.\n\n\"As Oracle continues to grow its AI infrastructure leveraging Arista switches, we see a need for advanced load balancing techniques to help avoid flow contentions and increase throughput in ML networks,” said Jag Brar, vice president and Distinguished Engineer, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. “Arista’s Cluster Load Balancing feature helps do that.”\n\nHolistic AI Observability\n\nCV UNO, the AI-driven 3600 Network Observability platform powered by Arista AVA™, delivers seamless, end-to-end AI job visibility by unifying network, system, and AI job data within the Arista Network Data Lake (NetDL™). EOS NetDL Streamer, a real-time telemetry framework that continuously streams granular network data from Arista switches into NetDL. Unlike traditional SNMP polling, which relies on periodic queries and can miss critical updates, the EOS NetDL Streamer provides low-latency, high-frequency, event-driven insights into network performance, key to supercharging large-scale AI training and inferencing infrastructure. Designed for AI accelerator clusters, it accelerates impact analysis, pinpoints issues with precision, and enables rapid resolution—ensuring job completion times are minimized. Some of the key benefits include:\n\nAI Job Monitoring – Unlocks a comprehensive view of AI job health metrics, including job completion times, congestion indicators (ECN-marked packets, PFC pause frames, packet drops), and buffer/link utilization for real-time insights.\n\nDeep-Dive Analytics – Uncovers critical job-specific insights by analyzing network devices, server NICs (e.g., PFC out-of-sync events, RDMA errors, PCIe fatal errors), and associated flows — pinpointing performance bottlenecks with precision.\n\nFlow Visualization – Harnesses the power of CV topology mapping to gain real-time, intuitive visibility into AI job flows at microsecond granularity — accelerating issue inference and resolution.\n\nProactive Resolution – Detects anomalies early and correlates network and compute performance within NetDL — ensuring uninterrupted, high-efficiency AI workload execution.\n\nArista AI Centers Driven by AVA\n\nArista’s EtherlinkTM AI Platforms deliver ultra-high-performance, standards-based Ethernet systems for next-gen AI networks. Offering 800G/400G fixed, modular, and distributed platforms that are forward-compatible with Ultra Ethernet Consortium (UEC), Etherlink scales from small AI clusters to massive deployments with 100,000+ accelerators. Arista features the AI Analyzer, powered by Arista AVA, which delivers high-resolution traffic data at 100-microsecond intervals, enabling precise performance optimization and troubleshooting. This allows network administrators to optimize performance, quickly troubleshoot issues, and make informed decisions for AI-driven networks. Arista AVA also powers a remote EOS AI Agent, that streams telemetry from SuperNICs or servers to NetDL, ensuring seamless network monitoring, debugging, and QoS consistency across the entire stack.\n\nAvailability\n\nCLB\n\nAvailable today on 7260X3, 7280R3, 7500R3 and 7800R3 platforms.\n\nSupport on 7060X6 and 7060X5 platforms scheduled for Q2 2025\n\nSupport for 7800R4 scheduled for 2H 2025\n\nCV UNO is available today. The observability enhancements for AI are in active customer trials, with general availability scheduled for Q2 2025\n\nRead industry support for this announcement here.\n\nRegister here for a webinar on April 10, 2025 to learn more about the EOS Smart AI suite and read a blog authored by Arista’s Praful Bhaidasna, director Product Management, here.\n\nAbout Arista Networks\n\nArista Networks is an industry leader in data-driven, client-to-cloud networking for large AI, data center, campus and routing environments.

A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis because these exclusions can be uncertain or difficult to predict, including stock-based compensation expense which is impacted by the company’s future hiring and retention needs and the future fair market value of the company’s common stock. The actual amount of these exclusions will have a significant impact on the company’s GAAP gross margin and GAAP operating margin.\n\nPrepared Materials and Conference Call Information\n\nArista's executives will discuss the first quarter 2024 financial results on a conference call at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time today.

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, gains/losses on strategic investments, and the income tax effect of these non-GAAP exclusions.

The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends.

Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to limitations, and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. A description of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.\n\nAbout Arista Networks\n\nArista Networks is an industry leader in data-driven, client to cloud networking for large data center/AI, campus and routing environments.

The Dow rose for a sixth-straight session, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lost ground.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the ridesharing firm posted a net loss after reporting hundreds of millions in charges related to revaluations of its investments. Its gross bookings also fell short of forecasts on slowing demand in Latin America and the earlier start dates for the Easter and Ramadan holidays.\n\nShares of Intel (INTC) declined as the chipmaker changed its current quarter guidance after U.S. regulators revoked its license to sell to Chinese telecom Huawei.\n\nTripadvisor (TRIP) shares also plunged as the online travel site said a special committee ruled against a potential merger.\n\nShares of Arista Networks (ANET) jumped as strong demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) products helped the cloud computing networking equipment maker exceed profit and sales estimates. It also raised its guidance and announced a $1.2 billion share repurchase program.\n\nReddit (RDDT) shares took off after the social media platform reported a lower-than-expected loss and soaring revenue on strong ad sales as user traffic hit a record high. It was the company’s first quarterly earnings report since going public in March.\n\nAd revenue declined at Fox (FOXA), but the media company beat earnings estimates as it rebounded from losses incurred by a legal settlement related to a defamation lawsuit.",
      "# [Why Arista Networks Stock Soared Today by Keith Noonan, www.facebook.com on 2025-01-22](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/01/22/why-arista-networks-stock-soared-today/)\nArista Networks (ANET -1.28%) stock surged in Wednesday's trading. The networking hardware company's share price ended the daily session up 6.8% and had been up as much as 8% earlier in trading. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index closed out the day up 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite index ended the session up 1.2%.\n\nAt the White House yesterday, leaders from OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank announced they had formed a new joint company that will invest up to $500 billion in U.S. artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. As a provider of hardware including switches and routers, Arista could wind up landing sales through the new investment project.\n\nArista Networks stock pops on big AI infrastructure news\n\nOpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank have come together to form Stargate -- a joint venture aimed at strengthening domestic AI infrastructure. At Stargate's announcement event yesterday, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison said that the company's first data center is already being constructed in Texas and will span one-million square feet upon completion.\n\nThe three partners are pouring a $100 billion initial investment into Stargate and could ramp their investment up to $500 billion in subsequent years. The move is a bullish development for AI processing and networking companies, and Arista Networks was among the names to get a valuation boost today thanks to the news.\n\nWhat comes next for Arista Networks?\n\nArista Networks looks poised to see long-term tailwinds related to AI data center spending. On the other hand, some strong future growth is already priced into the stock. With the company valued at roughly $163.5 billion, Arista is trading at 52.6 times this year's expected earnings.",

      "# [Arista Networks beats expectations and offers strong guidance on AI demand by MIKE WHEATLEY, ZEUS KERRAVALA, JAMES FARRELL, MARIA DEUTSCHER, DUNCAN RILEY on 2024-11-07](https://siliconangle.com/2024/11/07/arista-networks-beats-expectations-offers-strong-guidance-ai-demand/)\nShares of Arista Networks Inc. fell more than 6% in late-trading after the company delivered strong third-quarter earnings and revenue and offered guidance that came in above expectations.\n\nThe company reported earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $2.40 per share, while its revenue increased 20% from a year earlier to $1.81 billion. The results were much better than expected, with Wall Street analysts looking for earnings of just $2.08 per share on sales of $1.75 billion.\n\nNet income for the quarter came to $747.9 million, up from $545.3 million in the year-ago period.\n\nArista is a rival to the much larger Cisco Systems Inc. in the computer networking industry, focused on selling premium gear such as high-speed switches that accelerate communications between racks of computer servers in corporate data centers. Its largest customers include so-called hyperscaler cloud service providers such as Microsoft Corp. and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., though the company also has a solid footing in the enterprise market, with large companies, educational institutions and government agencies.\n\nThe company has delivered a string of impressive earnings and revenue beats over the last year, as hyperscalers and enterprises alike step up their spending on cloud computing and artificial intelligence-related infrastructure. AI applications need a rapid communications infrastructure to operate effectively, and that’s exactly what Arista provides with its high-end network switches and routers.\n\nArista’s rivals have also benefited from the interest in AI. Last week, Juniper Networks Inc., awaiting approval of an acquisition by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., delivered a similarly strong earnings and revenue beat, citing demand for AI. Arista said earlier this year it expects to generate about $750 million in AI-related revenue.\n\n“Arista remains at the forefront of next generation centers of data across client-to-cloud and AI focused locations,” said Arista Chairperson and Chief Executive Jayshree Ullal (pictured). “Our Q3 2024 results once again demonstrate our continued commitment to customer priorities as well as delivering strong financial results.”\n\nFor the current quarter, Arista sees no sign of the AI demand letting up. It’s anticipating revenue of between $1.85 billion and $1.9 billion, well ahead of the Street’s forecast of $1.8 billion. It also forecast an adjusted operating margin of 44%, compared to the analyst forecast of 43.5%.\n\nIn addition to today’s results, Arista announced plans for a four-to-one stock split, which will g into effect at the close of trading on Dec. 3.\n\nHolger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. said investors will be encouraged to see Arista continues to grow its business, with 20% revenue growth being a very solid performance from a well-established company.\n\n“It was conservative on the cost side, and that resulted in higher profitability and earnings per share, which are all things that investors appreciate,” the analyst said. “That said, the guidance for the current quarter was a tad conservative, and may have raised some concerns given that the AI market is generally growing at around 30% to 40%. Jayshree Ullal may be asked why Arista is not taking better advantage of this demand.”\n\nThe conservative guidance probably explains why Arista’s stock was down in extended trading, although it may also be due to simple profit taking by investors. Prior to today’s move, the shares had gained 83% in the year to date.\n\nPhoto: SiliconANGLE",
