It’s mandatory for businesses to provide a high level of service cost-effectively. While most hospitality organizations have deployed Wi-Fi, having it available is just the first step. Ensuring a secure and reliable Internet connection for all users is the real difference between Wi-Fi being a success or failure.\n\nWith Edge Threat Management, providing a secure and reliable wireless connection is simple and the benefits are clear. Customers will have the convenience to safely go online wherever they are located on the property. Basic Internet access can be provided for free, and if higher bandwidth is needed, tiered service offerings can be made available. For back-office operations, businesses can prioritize Internet traffic for reservation systems, administration tools, point-of-sale and more to provide a high level of service regardless of where the transaction occurs.\n\nContact Sales\n\nContact Sales for Hospitality & Retail\n\nMobile payments, including ApplePay, GooglePay, and CashApp have become increasingly popular among shoppers and retailers alike. Customers gain the ease of use by paying for their purchases with their mobile device, and retailers can declutter their payment station with streamlined payment terminals.

It compromises their ability to analyze traffic, identify threats or handle policy violations.\n\nSSL Inspector solves this problem. Whether it is driven by concerns about personal privacy, or the rise of web applications like Salesforce, Netflix and Facebook, the amount of encrypted Internet traffic has exploded. SSL Inspector puts NG Firewall in the middle of the encrypted traffic, with the ability to decrypt and analyze the data as it passes through.\n\nSSL Inspector creates a specialized certificate on each client. This certificate communicates directly with the gateway which is then able to decrypt HTTPS and SMTP traffic, process, and re-encrypt it on the fly all from within NG Firewall—without ever exposing the decrypted traffic to the network. This enables HTTPS traffic to be inspected in the same way as regular HTTP traffic, meaning that all NG Firewall apps and their rules can be applied.",

This visibility allows administrators to see in real-time what devices are on the network. As the attack surface expands with more IoT devices and users connecting with their personal devices (BYOD), admins need to know as much as possible about the devices connected on the network.\n\nGeo-IP Filter\n\nGeo-IP Filter, also known as geo-blocking, allows administrators to filter traffic by country, and can block traffic to or from a geographic location. Specific countries can be allowed if needed. This security feature provides an additional layer of security and control for network administrators.\n\nDHCP Relay\n\nFor enterprises with many distributed networks, admins may prefer to centrally manage IP assignment via DHCP. In this scenario, each network must be capable of forwarding DHCP requests to a central server via VPN tunnels or dedicated links such as MPLS.\n\nPlease refer to the release notes for more information.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nMicro Edge version 4.3 is available as a free upgrade to customers with a paid subscription. Device Discoverability and Geo-IP Filter is included in the Micro Edge Security software package.\n\nVersion 4.2 Highlights\n\nIPsec VPN\n\nMicro Edge is a lightweight device that extends the network reach to the very edge, and now with IPsec VPN provides a wide variety of connectivity options.

Threat Prevention scans IP addresses, blocking or granting access to web and application-based content after a complete analysis of the IP address reputation.\n\nIP address reputation scoring is based on the Webroot BrightCloud® IP Reputation Service ranking system. This intelligent, real-time packet inspection categorizes IP addresses into five distinct categories – High Risk, Suspicious, Moderate Risk, Low Risk, and Trustworthy. Just as a credit score, an IP Reputation score reviews web page associations, files, and any historical security issues the page may have had in the past as well as how clean it is today.\n\nLayered Security Solutions\n\nLayered Security Solutions are critical when creating a robust network security system. Implementing a multi-layered protection scheme can ensure that there are several checkpoints within the network to identify, check, and review content, complicating any opportunity a cybercriminal may take to infiltrate the network and access valuable data.\n\nThreat Prevention, layered with the advanced applications currently available on NG Firewall, such as Web Filter, and Virus Blocker, allow SMBs and organizations to protect against malicious activity.\n\nWeb Filter and Virus Blocker applications ensure that people can only get to web pages that are safe and secure. Adding Threat Prevention as a secondary layer reviews files, services and services accessed on the network. If any network packets do not meet the established safety criteria, they are blocked and rendered inaccessible on the corporate network.\n\nSMBs and organizations now have multiple battalions of protection working on their behalf to seek out and block malicious activity that might come from any entrance point. Any incoming threat will be stopped by one, two, or all of NG Firewall’s protective apps before it can reach the company network."

      "# Post ID 15mvynk: Cisco vs Juniper vs Arista (and maybe Aruba/HPE) with +50 score by [(sadllamas, Reddit, 2023-08-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/15mvynk/cisco_vs_juniper_vs_arista_and_maybe_arubahpe/)\nI've read quite a few posts about this very topic, or similar enough anyway:\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/144wdg5/arista\\_vs\\_cisco/](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/144wdg5/arista_vs_cisco/)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/125koba/need\\_to\\_choose\\_vendor\\_arista\\_or\\_cisco\\_or\\_extreme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/125koba/need_to_choose_vendor_arista_or_cisco_or_extreme/)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/t2pidy/advice\\_on\\_arista\\_and\\_juniper\\_2022/](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/t2pidy/advice_on_arista_and_juniper_2022/)\n\nOur organization is now in a similar boat. We have expressed disatisfaction with Cisco lately, especially in regards to licensing and costs. So now we have one VAR trying to sell us on Arista, one VAR trying to sell us on Juniper, and one VAR trying to keep us on Cisco, or if they can't get pricing low enough, wanting us to look at Aruba/HPE instead.\n\nWe are currently an all Cisco shop, save for our firewalls, which are Palo Altos - they are managed by a different team and not part of this consideration. We have around 275 switches, and around 50 routers. We run Prime Infrastructure 3.10.4 for network management and Paessler PRTG for monitoring/graphing and alerting. If we do end up moving away from Cisco, it would be a gradual shift via attrition as existing devices go EoL and we budget for refreshes, so interoperability will be a big plus.\n\nArista has cautiously sold us on their focus on software testing and \"Industry Standard CLI\" (basically as legally close as they can get to Cisco CLI structure without infringing, lol). They claim to have low bug counts, specifically in regards to CVEs. Cautious because we are understandably wary of trusting everything we hear from a vendor trying to sell to us. However, this is sounding pretty good to us, since the following bug recently left a sour taste in our mouths: [https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/quickview/bug/CSCwc41288](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/quickview/bug/CSCwc41288)\n\nJuniper seems to be a fairly mature option, but the CLI is different enough that the learning curve would be higher. I'm also wary of some of the feedback I've seen in other threads regarding bugs and similar issues. MIST seems to be a fairly strong selling point for a lot folks.\n\nWe have done day-long test drives/demos of both Arista and Juniper so far, led by the respective VARs. I don't have a lot of info on Aruba/HPE, as that vendor has only started talking to us about it this week.\n\nWhat are your experiences with these vendors? Even if you only have experience with one of the four. What do you like/dislike? How are their respective management platforms? Is there a particular feature that greatly increased your quality of life on the job? Anything you can add would be greatly appreciated!\n\n## Comment ID jvj9gnc with +16 score by [(kenspi, Reddit, 2023-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/15mvynk/cisco_vs_juniper_vs_arista_and_maybe_arubahpe/jvj9gnc/) (in reply to ID 15mvynk):\nI run a Juniper shop (QFX and EX) with some Arista and now Dell, too, due to availability and aggressive pricing, plus integration with Dell PowerStore.  Most of my experience is with Juniper so I have more to say about it than the others.  Both Juniper and Arista are solid and fast, and I've been happy with the Dell S-series so far (former Force10).  I don't regret any of those purchases.\n\nJUNOS is a completely different command structure from the others, and not at all difficult to learn.  JUNOS also has the magical \"commit confirmed\" command which can save your butt if the location is remote. (it will rollback to the previous configuration after a defined period if you don't confirm that the configuration is good (i.e. lose connectivity.)  That also means you can make a bunch of changes to multiple interfaces all at once, then commit them all simultaneously.  I've used these standalone as well as Virtual Chassis and rarely have problems. Another nice bit about JUNOS is the configs are saved locally as a file. You can rollback to a previous config, and you can copy the config file to an ordinary server for backup. You don't need something like CatTools to do the backups, though you'd probably want something to automate it.\n\nArista is very Cisco-like in the command structure so the learning curve is nothing, but they want you to use their optics. It's not a deal breaker but a point work making. Dell's OS10 (FTOS) is similar, and the S-series supports ONIE if you want a different NOS. They also want you to use Dell optics. (I use FS optics programmed for Arista or Dell).\n\nI'll be replacing my aging Juniper EX stack in the coming year, and all 3 of these vendors will be considered.\n\n### Comment ID jvkv04x with +6 score by [(Bluecobra, Reddit, 2023-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/15mvynk/cisco_vs_juniper_vs_arista_and_maybe_arubahpe/jvkv04x/) (in reply to ID jvj9gnc):\nYou can use third-party optics on Arista.

EOS is just rock solid with a great api and tons of options for automation. The development and adoption of new features is also something Arista do well . Licensing is simple and generally designed to be simple . There are L3 licenses for advanced features but these are honor based. Junipers OS and hardware are just as good as Cisco or Arista but they have taken a different approach with their extensible OS . It takes a bit of getting used to but allows greater flexibility in how you configure things . Hardware is solid from the QFx to ex switches right up to their MX routers. It's built well and the licensing doesn't require a PhD in documentation management. Also a bit cheaper than Arista in my experience. Can't comment on Aruba was looking at them recently but lead times put me off.\n\n### Comment ID jvjnspm with +5 score by [(poodle-oodle, Reddit, 2023-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/15mvynk/cisco_vs_juniper_vs_arista_and_maybe_arubahpe/jvjnspm/) (in reply to ID jviulh4):\n\"the licensing doesn't require a PhD in documentation management\" made me laugh because you are so right! Cisco's licensing model is ridiculous. \n\nI really liked working on Juniper switches, routers, and firewalls when I worked in the service provider world honestly. The command line takes some getting used to but I ended up really preferring it, I love commit confirmed, and how easy it is to see recent changes made across all platforms (I do know you can do this with some Cisco devices too but not all of them to my knowledge).

Being tacked onto NX-OS I wouldn't trust it, but that's my bias showing.\n\nCisco IOS and XE can do configuration archives and rollbacks.

I personally love having to endter the command and then having to commit the changes for them to take effect.  Gives you a second or two to pause and verify that things would work before you lock your self out of the switch.\n\nArista downside is that you are tied into thier transcivers unless you get a unsupported tranaciever licence from Arista.

I understand you can enter the config change and press enter and if it is wrong you aren't locked out because you haven't actually committed the change, but what happens when you do that, you are reviewing the config you 'think' it is correct, but it actually isn't and then you proceed to commit the change, you'd still be locked out, right?\n\nMaybe I'm missing something obvious here.\n\n#### Comment ID jvlkm7s with +5 score by [(upstatenet, Reddit, 2023-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/15mvynk/cisco_vs_juniper_vs_arista_and_maybe_arubahpe/jvlkm7s/) (in reply to ID jvkr9hz):\nThink of Junos as having two configurations, an active config and a candidate config. The active config is just like IOS' running-config; this is what's currently running. The candidate config is a copy of the active configuration you can modify, but changes don't become active until the commit process completes.\n\nIn the example below, the VLAN is set on two switchports. Port 4 is set to a valid VLAN while port 5 is set to a VLAN that doesn't exist. After the changes are made, config compare shows the differences between the active config and the candidate config. In this case the only differences are the two changes we intended to make, but it's good to verify changes before actually committing.\n\nFinally, the commit command is run to replace the active config with the candidate config we've modified. Part of this process is validating the entire candidate configuration. In this case, the commit was rejected because port 5 is set to a VLAN that isn't defined. Since commits are atomic, the active config hasn't been changed. You can now correct the issue raised and re-run commit to activate your updated config.\n\n```\n{master:0}\nupsatenet@SmithHall-207-SW08> configure\nEntering configuration mode\n\n{master:0}[edit]\nupsatenet@SmithHall-207-SW08# set interfaces ge-0/0/4 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members GoodVLAN\n\n{master:0}[edit]\nupsatenet@SmithHall-207-SW08# set interfaces ge-0/0/5 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members MissingVLAN\n\n{master:0}[edit]\nupsatenet@SmithHall-207-SW08# show | compare\n[edit interfaces]\n+   ge-0/0/4 {\n+       unit 0 {\n+           family ethernet-switching {\n+               vlan {\n+                   members GoodVLAN;\n+               }\n+           }\n+       }\n+   }\n+   ge-0/0/5 {\n+       unit 0 {\n+           family ethernet-switching {\n+               vlan {\n+                   members MissingVLAN;\n+               }\n+           }\n+       }\n+   }\n\n{master:0}[edit]\nupsatenet@SmithHall-207-SW08# commit comment \"Setting VLAN on Example Ports\"\nerror: In routing-instance default-switch vlan MissingVLAN configured under interface ge-0/0/5.0 does not exist\nerror: configuration check-out failed\n\n{master:0}[edit]\nupsatenet@SmithHall-207-SW08#\n\n```\n\n#### Comment ID jvl1k6k with +3 score by [(Twanks, Reddit, 2023-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/15mvynk/cisco_vs_juniper_vs_arista_and_maybe_arubahpe/jvl1k6k/) (in reply to ID jvkr9hz):\n> you'd still be locked out, right?\n\nNot if you use commit confirmed.

In Juniper, adding a vlan is a set command and you have to explicitly delete a vlan on a trunk.  Doing a \"show | compare\" on every change is a really good habit to have, and while you can still break things it seems less likely IMHO.  If you're unsure about something you can do a \"commit confirmed\" to automatically roll back your changes.\n\n#### Comment ID jvltrjt with +1 score by [(evergreen_netadmin1, Reddit, 2023-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/15mvynk/cisco_vs_juniper_vs_arista_and_maybe_arubahpe/jvltrjt/) (in reply to ID jvkr9hz):\n.. until you've done it so many times that you literally type \"wr mem\" without even thinking after just about every command. :P\n\n### Comment ID jvlu203 with +2 score by [(mahanutra, Reddit, 2023-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/15mvynk/cisco_vs_juniper_vs_arista_and_maybe_arubahpe/jvlu203/) (in reply to ID jvisj26):\nI think we started in year 2010 with HPE ComwareOS 5 based switches after HPE bought about 50% of H3C.

I resigned from Cisco last year I work at Arista presently. I have no interest in promoting either but will be informing on Arista.\n\nStacking - Nope  \nWe do not have stacking at Arista. One situation where it matters beyond our influence is with third party software that has licensing by the device/IP. Most often this is not a significant constraint but notable. We will introduce stack like provisioning from our management platform CVP but never merge 2+ devices into one from a single/functional control and data plane.\n\nMLAG - Yup  \nOn a positive note and as noted earlier by another contributor we do not need stacking for MLAG/MC-LAG... the mLag config is VERY similar to VPC on Cisco NX-OS, almost line for line subbing \"mlag\" for \"vpc\". For gateway: we use a local FHRP feature called VARP where both sides are active similar to modifications made to HSRP by Cisco to opportunistically route but we have no standby/mcast heartbeat requirement. Google \"wiki mlag\" for a brief and informative review of all the vendors. I live in Canada and Nortel's SMLT was the first afaik\n\nISSU/SSU - Yup  \nAlmost every fixed switch from campus/wiring closet to DC server/ToR switch we offer provides SSU \\[akin to ISSU\\] with no need for a peer, stack, etc. Possibly\\[?\\] Brocade introduced non-disruptive upgrades/downgrades first to Fibre channel fixed form-factor switches 20 years ago? Anyhow, most all non-redundant control plane platforms at Arista employ SSU which provides continuous L2/L3/PoE etc during software upgrades/downgrades or reboots. Reconvergence/downtime is sub-second. We have no software dependencies upgrade/downgrade release paths etc following the release it was introduced. \n\nStack Cabling - typically 100G QSFP to 25G preterm break out - 10-16 nodes  \nOur campus switches interconnect into Pods using traditional \"uplink\" ports. We typically use 100G ports with inexpensive cables in breakout.. you can google this but in short you're looking at around $200per closet \\[eg 4 x QSFP-4xSFP\\] in pre-term QSFP-SFP cabling for a 10 node pod.\n\n## Comment ID jvirkaf with +5 score by [(foalainc, Reddit, 2023-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/15mvynk/cisco_vs_juniper_vs_arista_and_maybe_arubahpe/jvirkaf/) (in reply to ID 15mvynk):\nAt the edge, Aruba is good and I've sold a good amount (especially SilverPeak), and that's including switching, wireless and dot1x. \n\nI have not sold any Juniper. \n\nWe've only sold Arista as a core and ToR.

Access ? Campus ? Metro aggregation ? Datacenter ? Not all vendors are equal on each fronts.\n\nOn access and small campus, if it weren't for their idiotic prices and shittiest licensing, I'd stick to Catalysts. Actually I do still get some refurbs and run them unsupported. They're rock-solid with the right configurations. But H3C (not the ProCurve line, those are door-stops) has greatly improved lately, looking to converge up with Aruba. Though if permitted I'd get some Huaweis, S3k to S6k, best bang for bucks.\n\nThough if you want to go FttD (fiber to the desktop) on a campus, which is _really_ the way to go, I'd pick Nokia (7360 ISAM FX) or Huawei (EA5800). On a large campus you can replace dozens of rooms full of patch panels and switches with a single rack holding two of these babies in a failover PON setup.\n\nOn metro aggregation (think NSP with metro fiber, or extended campus), I have a lot of experience with Cisco ASR and NCS series, though their licencing is a non-starter now, so I'm moving my clients off to Nokia (mostly 7250 IXRs).\n\nWhen it comes to datacenter, that's a no brainer. Go check avd.sh and tell me you still want anything else than Arista. Juniper is fixing its mess with the QFX line, most devastating bugs have been almost ironed-out so you can run a decent EVPN fabric on them, but their documentation and available code for automation is wayy behind Arista's.\n\n## Comment ID jw7559v with +3 score by [(LightningMcWeer, Reddit, 2023-08-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/15mvynk/cisco_vs_juniper_vs_arista_and_maybe_arubahpe/jw7559v/) (in reply to ID 15mvynk):\nArista.

Automated configurations via Studios/Workspaces is super convenient and they run real-time statistics and traffic flows without extra configs. They’ve also got a CICD pipeline in development among a whole host of other new features coming soon to help manage tenancies and data visualization for customers. They have a free PoC program where they’ll build out the scenario you want to test and put it thru the ringer for validation. Can’t expound how impressive their platform is.\n\nAs for the mention about using their optics, it’s a single command to activate full non-vendor optic support and it functions as intended.

In last 7 years we migrated all DCs to Juniper and most of our customers as well. We use MX, QFX, EX and SRX.\n\nWe had lots of problems on JunOS version 14, however since version 18 it is more or less stable. More or less as we did encounter multiple bugs related to EVPN on JunOS 18 or recently we experienced bugs on EX4600 running 21.4R3-S2.\n\nFrom operational perspective, syntax and commit is the best you can get. You get commit history so you can easily see what changes have been made and rollback to particular config revision whenever you want.\n\nWhat I don't like are software upgrades, according to official docs and JTAC you can't jump between more than 3 software releases. Juniper releases a lot of JunOS versions so e.g. if you're upgrading from 18.4 to 21.4 you need to perform around 4 jumps with intermittent versions.\n\nAlso the NSSU isn't the best, we've had multiple issues with that. Switches in stacks were going to split-brain. We raised a TAC which advised not to use NSSU but rather regular upgrades or to perform manual NSSU.\n\nIf you choose juniper, remember to use only Junos SR software relases and probably best to choose -S2 and upwards. The base versions and even -S1 tend to be buggy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall juniper is good product which I can recommend, best to have a juniper lab though to test newer JunOS versions and the upgrade procedure.\n\n## Comment ID jvkhqxm with +1 score by [(luieklimmer, Reddit, 2023-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/15mvynk/cisco_vs_juniper_vs_arista_and_maybe_arubahpe/jvkhqxm/) (in reply to ID 15mvynk):\nWe moved from Cisco to Arista in the DC with zero regrets.

Potential downsides of Arista that I see in the campus are: \n\n* No stacking - You might have to introduce a distribution layer, daisy-chain switches or ensure you have the spare fiber plant available to connect your switches in the IDFs to MDF. \n* Would need to validate their SLA's for RMA's in all countries / locations we operate\n* SLA's for P2 cases only guarantee a 1-hour response during business hours (what are defined business hours for a global enterprise? What if we want 24x7 ?)\n* The majority of their switches don't support an outbound service policy / QoS remarking. They support inbound which would require a QoS transformation for us. \n* As wonderful as Cloudvision is for the DC, their CV-CUE and AGNI solutions for campus aren't a single integrated solution yet. \n* Having trouble visualizing how Cloudvision would look / scale with many sites and thousands of switches and access-points.\n* A large portion of their revenue comes from CSP's / Cloud Giants and obviously a lot of attention goes towards them. They've been making an entry into Campus for years now but when I compare the marketing campaigns that I see as evidence of them doubling-down on executing on a campus strategy at scale and commitment to growing that part of the business, I simply don't see that budget being spent on Campus when compared to Juniper/Cisco/HPE-Aruba. \n\nThat said, they've proven themselves in the DC and will take a hard look at them for campus to see if we can overcome the aforementioned challenges.\n\n## Comment ID jvkumar with +1 score by [(Bluecobra, Reddit, 2023-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/15mvynk/cisco_vs_juniper_vs_arista_and_maybe_arubahpe/jvkumar/) (in reply to ID 15mvynk):\nArista is great but their lead times are almost comical now, they really need to get their act together with this chip shortage nonsense.

      "# Post ID 1eyl31e: Cisco vs. Arista Maintenance & Renewals—Which is Better? with +9 score by [(Owlytica, Reddit, 2024-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/1eyl31e/cisco_vs_arista_maintenance_renewalswhich_is/)\nHey everyone, I’m curious about how Cisco’s maintenance and renewal processes compare to Arista’s. With Cisco, we have Smartnet for maintenance and warranties, but I’ve noticed some ongoing issues. For example, Cisco’s records can be inaccurate, leading to situations where they try to renew more maintenance than what the customer actually owns.\n\nAnother challenge is the disconnect between Cisco DNA licensing and the associated hardware, especially when a customer has an Enterprise Agreement (EA). When renewals come around, Cisco sometimes charges based on what’s been downloaded rather than what’s been consumed, which can be frustrating.\n\nI’m wondering if Arista has similar challenges, or if their maintenance and renewals process is more straightforward. Is Arista easier—or perhaps even harder—to manage from a maintenance and renewals perspective? Cisco has the Ready Report to export records, but it’s often outdated and inaccurate. Does Arista deal with these kinds of issues as well?\n\nWould love to hear your experiences\n\n## Comment ID ljdyg0e with +17 score by [(sryan2k1, Reddit, 2024-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/1eyl31e/cisco_vs_arista_maintenance_renewalswhich_is/ljdyg0e/) (in reply to ID 1eyl31e):\nArista has about 5 license levels that are all very clearly laid out about what features require what licenses.\n\n[https://www.arista.com/en/support/product-documentation/eos-feature-licensing/eos-platform-licensing](https://www.arista.com/en/support/product-documentation/eos-feature-licensing/eos-platform-licensing)\n\nNo licensing is mandatory (Base is included with the price of the device), there is no on box licensing (all honor based) Edit - Apparently MACSec is enforced, I assume due to legal/regulatory reasons though and not because they really wanted to. \n\n\n\nThe renewals are single line item SKUs priced per month with the quantity needed for each model/coverage type.

Cisco historically has created many proprietary protocols to keep their customers in the Cisco eco system. (cdp, eigrp, fabricpath to name a few).\n\nThis is quite a bit of a misrepresentation of Cisco.\n\nCisco developed IGRP in the mid-80s because RIP was too limiting with the 15 hop distance. OSPF first RFC was 1989. EIGRP evolved from IGRP in 1993 because IGRP only supported classful routing. Cisco supports all these protocols.\n\nCDP 1994. LLDP 2005. Cisco supports both.\n\nFabricPath - same data plane structure as the standard TRILL, released before TRILL had a completed control plane standard (so the switching ASICs would be able to forward either in hardware). Unfortunately, TRILL was DOA due to the emergence and adoption of VXLAN.\n\nHSRP came out before VRRP, Cisco supports both.\n\nPAgP came out before LACP, Cisco supports both.\n\nBasically, Cisco has historically developed many capabilities now taken for granted to differentiate and offer features they saw the market needed, and **did not otherwise exist**. They then sat on or contributed to many standards working groups to develop open standards in conjunction with other vendors and industry contributors.\n\nAs a result, they support both. Original proprietary protocols because there may be some systems that still use those today and don’t want to migrate; and industry standard implementations for cross vendor compatibility.\n\nCisco is no angel. Arista is doing amazing things and I love their business model, they would be my primary choice in the data centre and would be a top vendor for evaluation in campus. But Cisco has developed a lot of the features that are standards today before they existed anywhere, then helped develop and define equivalent standards.\n\n#### Comment ID jqleez0 with +3 score by [(element9261, Reddit, 2023-07-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/144wdg5/arista_vs_cisco/jqleez0/) (in reply to ID jnifh6r):\nWhat a great post, love the history here.\n\n#### Comment ID jniky6h with +1 score by [(Golle, Reddit, 2023-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/144wdg5/arista_vs_cisco/jniky6h/) (in reply to ID jnifh6r):\nThanks for clarifying!\n\n### Comment ID jni0bh4 with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/144wdg5/arista_vs_cisco/jni0bh4/) (in reply to ID jnhwvjf):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID jni26he with +2 score by [(Golle, Reddit, 2023-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/144wdg5/arista_vs_cisco/jni26he/) (in reply to ID jni0bh4):\nI wasn't denying that Cisco is also using Linux as its underlying OS.

Easy migration, a minor quirk with OSPF, which TAC were quickly able to help us with, MLAG is great and very stable.\nCode rarely has security vulns so you're upgrading them alot less than Cisco.\nOften, security vulns can be fixed with a hot patch which doesn't require a restart.\n\nTac have always been knowledgeable and good to work with, usually the 1st person you speak to is able to resolve your issue, or get you on a call with other techies to troubleshoot.\n\nTheir CloudVision management tool is great for deploying changes including change control, easy upgrades and for viewing historical changes aka Telemetry (routing changes, neighbor changes etc).\n\nConfiguration of things like vxlan, evpn etc are simple and Intuitive. \n\n\nThere's a few validated leaf spine designs, like layer 2, layer 3 or vxlan-evpn which are a good read.\nEVPN is becoming very popular so probably the way to go if you aren't using it already\nGood documentation on their site.\n\nWould fully recommend.\n\n## Comment ID hjbwa5x with +9 score by [(scritty, Reddit, 2021-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/qmpf5s/moving_from_cisco_to_arista_any_experiences/hjbwa5x/) (in reply to ID qmpf5s):\nIt's been fucking *great*. TAC is super responsive and usually the person who picks up the phone is the person who solves your issue.\n\nThey can and will create a new hardware depot to hold spares for you so they can meet any SLAs if you're operating locations outside their 'normal' areas. We've always received replacement hardware in half the SLA time; never had a switch die in service though, only one 7050SX3 DOA and a couple 100G bidi transceivers that went wonky.\n\nAutomation with 'configure replace' has been wonderful, you can define the config you want and the switch/EOS will deliver the final result without issues.\n\nTesting via cEOS (containerized EOS) or vEOS (virtual EOS) has been awesome and [containerlab](https://containerlab.srlinux.dev/) is a fast way to get an Arista topology up and running / have a play with something. Arista is supported in [Batfish](https://www.batfish.org/) so you can write standardized tests for your network environment and ensure you catch failures before you deploy a new config.\n\nLiterally the only annoying issue with Arista is that you have to have a special organization-specific 'key' in your configuration to use 3rd party transceivers. Stupid, completely out of place issue that is totally alien to the rest of the experience with this vendor. Just tell them you won't buy their kit unless they provide the key and you're golden.\n\nIt's a great move for your org to go to Arista from Cisco, no regrets.\n\n## Comment ID hjdfax6 with +8 score by [(DigitalDefenestrator, Reddit, 2021-11-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/qmpf5s/moving_from_cisco_to_arista_any_experiences/hjdfax6/) (in reply to ID qmpf5s):\nArista is terrible and you absolutely should not order any of their gear under any circumstances.\n\n(This post brought to you by global supply issues and long lead times on the Arista gear we're very happy with)\n\n## Comment ID hjbs0hx with +6 score by [(dannymuffins, Reddit, 2021-11-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/qmpf5s/moving_from_cisco_to_arista_any_experiences/hjbs0hx/) (in reply to ID qmpf5s):\nI fucking love Arista.

One negative I will say about Arista though, is they are laughably 'cheap' and at times it really shows.\n\nFor example - the 7280SRAM claims MACSEC support, which it has, but only on the 100G ports.. they cheaped out on doing MACSEC Phy on the SFP+ ports....  That being said they give you some 'hack' where you can disable a 100G port, recirculate packets through the 100G PHY then out the 10G port with MACSEC now part of the frame.  They call this [MACSEC Proxy for VXLAN](https://www.arista.com/en/um-eos/eos-data-plane-security#xx1210966)\n\nJust make sure you CLEARLY state what you need now and in the future so you don't find yourself getting stuck into corners because they cheaped out on some part of the physical HW/Platform.\n\nOne other thing I have noticed is they tend to provide slight variations in physical platforms, or they have niche platforms they tend to trap you with.  I had a customer who was looking for a 10G-BaseT switch between Cisco, Juniper, and Arista....  They wanted to be able to swap out any vendor at any time for another vendor... The downside is they built their 'minimum viable config' around the Arista switch, which had 2 more 100G ports than the Cisco, Juniper, or any other switch vendor had on their 10G-BaseT switches.  So now they locked themselves into a form factor no one else offers... so don't get caught up on 'Arista Exclusive' speeds and feeds.\n\n## Comment ID hjeu5b3 with +5 score by [(StubArea51, Reddit, 2021-11-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/qmpf5s/moving_from_cisco_to_arista_any_experiences/hjeu5b3/) (in reply to ID qmpf5s):\nArista actually tests their software.

This is more like a chassis (with redundant SM) build out of fixed switches. This makes updates/upgrades much easier.

It's a collection of Ansible roles, playbooks, templates, and opinionated designs that create configurations and place them on switches (either directly or through CloudVision). \n\nThere's a bit of a learning curve, but it's really cool stuff.\n\nhttps://avd.sh\n\n## Comment ID idn2v7g with +4 score by [(evanmckee, Reddit, 2022-06-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/vjdcj5/aristacisco_similarities_and_differences/idn2v7g/) (in reply to ID vjdcj5):\nhttps://reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/uxlvkg/new_to_arista/\n\nThis might help.\n\n## Comment ID idmc0e6 with +3 score by [(imveryalme, Reddit, 2022-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/vjdcj5/aristacisco_similarities_and_differences/idmc0e6/) (in reply to ID vjdcj5):\nI'm a fan of CVP for management & patching as well....\n\n## Comment ID idmy1pw with +3 score by [(jugganutz, Reddit, 2022-06-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/vjdcj5/aristacisco_similarities_and_differences/idmy1pw/) (in reply to ID vjdcj5):\nWay less patching and more time focusing on other things. Better software bug control. Command line is very Cisco like, hence why they got sued. Software consistancy across all platforms as well. Open standards vs proprietary all around wins. If you want, talk to your Arista representative and download a VM and play with it.",
      "# Post ID 1gm614k: Arista Networks beats earnings expectations but stock falls 6%: Why? with +26 score by [(Local-Store-491, Reddit, 2024-11-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gm614k/arista_networks_beats_earnings_expectations_but/)\nI'm studying stocks for a university subject, so bear with me if I'm missing something that the earnings report today said, but:\n\n* Year-over-year growth of 7%\n* Net income of $2.33 per share, beating expectations and above the $1.72 per share a year ago.\n* Announced stock split 4 to 1\n* Revenue rose 7.1% to $1.81 billion, beating estimates of $1.74 billion.\n\nBut after-hours market still saw the stock value tumble -6%.\n\nWhy? I really can't get it and my professor ignores all my questions.\n\n## Comment ID lvzxkfg with +55 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-11-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gm614k/arista_networks_beats_earnings_expectations_but/lvzxkfg/) (in reply to ID 1gm614k):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID lvzyq0f with +11 score by [(Local-Store-491, Reddit, 2024-11-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gm614k/arista_networks_beats_earnings_expectations_but/lvzyq0f/) (in reply to ID lvzxkfg):\nI really appreciate your advice, I had a hunch about Wall Street setting expectations too high but nowhere this specific. Seems that this stock was riskier than appearances suggested.\n\nI'll study up the stock tumble from the point-of-view you offered.\n\nFrom a lost uni student, once again, I really appreciate the insight.\n\n#### Comment ID lw0xx7v with +2 score by [(Thisisthematt, Reddit, 2024-11-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gm614k/arista_networks_beats_earnings_expectations_but/lw0xx7v/) (in reply to ID lvzyq0f):\nIt’s a game of chicken. If Microsoft and Meta announce they are reducing spend on data center (or capex) in general then Anet looks way riskier all of a sudden. If they keep spending then it is cheap.\n\n## Comment ID lw05wu4 with +14 score by [(here-to-argue, Reddit, 2024-11-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gm614k/arista_networks_beats_earnings_expectations_but/lw05wu4/) (in reply to ID 1gm614k):\nANET back to prices not seen since Tuesday. It is up 11.5% in the past five days. Expectations were very high going into earnings, and even good earnings can be “not good enough” in these cases.\n\n## Comment ID lw4zhrn with +6 score by [(LufaMaster, Reddit, 2024-11-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gm614k/arista_networks_beats_earnings_expectations_but/lw4zhrn/) (in reply to ID 1gm614k):\nStock moves are determined by results vs expectations of those results, not by whatever happened a year ago.  With ANET, everyone expected great results.  We already knew roughly what their revenue and EPS growth would be.  That growth was already priced into the stock, hence its up 70% YTD.  So what's dictating the stock move is whether the new news is incrementally better or worse than people expected.  In this case, ANET investors wanted more color on how big AI will be in 2025 and 2026 - and they didn't come away feeling as confident as they hoped/was priced in.  But a good mgmt team doles out good news in tiny but steady doses, so just because they didn't pound the table today doesn't mean great things aren't coming.  \n\nThe commenter above saying its about gross margins is wrong in my opinion.  ANET's GM have fluctuated between 63-65% for years depending on customer mix in a given quarter, with lower GMs when they have more hyperscaler mix (MSFT, META - who get volume discounts) and higher GMs when its more enterprise customer mix.  The stock doesn't care about 63% or 65% GM in this company.  For other companies, that matters.\n\n## Comment ID lw0195q with +3 score by [(tabrizzi, Reddit, 2024-11-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gm614k/arista_networks_beats_earnings_expectations_but/lw0195q/) (in reply to ID 1gm614k):\nWhat's the guidance?\n\n## Comment ID lw286mc with +3 score by [(duncanjjj, Reddit, 2024-11-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gm614k/arista_networks_beats_earnings_expectations_but/lw286mc/) (in reply to ID 1gm614k):\nGuidance.  \nStock price is all about what’s happening in the future, not the past.

You will never afford a house that you can call home that is within a reasonable commute distance to work, forget about it! They're wasting billions building a new HQ so they can enforce a full RTO instead of paying employees decent wages.\n\nZERO benefits working at Arista over ANY other company in the SV area. They don't even have a company cafeteria to avoid paying for a $20 lunch. There goes $2k of your already meager salary down the drain! On paper we have \"Unlimited PTO\" but your coworkers and managers make it very clear not to take more than 4 weeks or there will be consequences in your next performance review.\n\nPurposefully opaque swe levels so that the company can underpay everyone! The only purpose of having your coworkers review you is so that this company can advertise this as a benefit to fool you into working for a very low compensation level while the execs run out the back with all the money! \n\nSpeaking of execs, don't be fooled by Kenneth Duda's high and mighty speeches about good software; remember that you will be paid pennies to write that good software for him while he sits in his giant study of his mansion and preaches about it to you on a regular basis.\n\nThere is no such thing as company pride here. All of the company events are cheap and nobody even shows up to them. There are 2 types of employees at arista: the recent ones stuck here like me and the decade long employees getting at least 20x my salary thanks to stock appreciation since they joined. The only reason why anyone from the last few years is here is because they couldn't get into company X Y or Z that they actually wanted to get into. I have yet to meet anyone young at this company that is \"proud\" to work here or genuinely wanted to work here.\n\nOverall, I would only work here as a last resort to keep from starving on the streets. Always spend the extra time you have from working less than 8 hours on finding a better company because you will not have enough money to do any interesting hobby to make your life fulfilling.",

They don't even have a company cafeteria to avoid paying for a $20 lunch. There goes $2k of your already meager salary down the drain! On paper we have \"Unlimited PTO\" but your coworkers and managers make it very clear not to take more than 4 weeks or there will be consequences in your next performance review.\n\nPurposefully opaque swe levels so that the company can underpay everyone! The only purpose of having your coworkers review you is so that this company can advertise this as a benefit to fool you into working for a very low compensation level while the execs run out the back with all the money! \n\nSpeaking of execs, don't be fooled by Kenneth Duda's high and mighty speeches about good software; remember that you will be paid pennies to write that good software for him while he sits in his giant study of his mansion and preaches about it to you on a regular basis.\n\nThere is no such thing as company pride here. All of the company events are cheap and nobody even shows up to them. There are 2 types of employees at arista: the recent ones stuck here like me and the decade long employees getting at least 20x my salary thanks to stock appreciation since they joined. The only reason why anyone from the last few years is here is because they couldn't get into company X Y or Z that they actually wanted to get into. I have yet to meet anyone young at this company that is \"proud\" to work here or genuinely wanted to work here.\n\nOverall, I would only work here as a last resort to keep from starving on the streets.

      "# [Arista Networks, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2024 Financial Results by Arista Networks, Whitney Sisler on 2024-05-07](https://www.arista.com/en/company/news/press-release/19453-pr-20240507)\nBoard of Directors Authorizes Additional $1.2B Stock Repurchase Program\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif.- May 7, 2024 -- Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE: ANET), an industry leader in data-driven, client to cloud networking for large data center/AI, campus and routing environments, today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nFirst Quarter Financial Highlights\n\n“Arista is off to a strong start to 2024 with solid first quarter results,” said Jayshree Ullal, Chairperson and CEO of Arista Networks. “As we get ready to celebrate the 10th anniversary of our IPO in June, I am pleased with our progress in the Arista 2.0 journey as seen in breakthrough innovations, customer traction and building our next generation leaders.”\n\nRevenue of $1.571 billion, an increase of 2.0% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, and an increase of 16.3% from the first quarter of 2023.\n\nGAAP gross margin of 63.7%, compared to GAAP gross margin of 64.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 59.5% in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin of 64.2%, compared to non-GAAP gross margin of 65.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 60.3% in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nGAAP net income of $637.7 million, or $1.99 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $436.5 million, or $1.38 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net income of $637.7 million, or $1.99 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $452.5 million, or $1.43 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nCommenting on the company's financial results, Chantelle Breithaupt, Arista’s CFO said, \"We are pleased with our performance this quarter, which exceeded expectations across key financial metrics. Our commitment remains to deliver long-term value to our shareholders through sustained financial performance and strategic investments.\"\n\nStock Repurchase Programs\n\nArista has now completed repurchases of its common stock totaling $2 billion under previous stock repurchase programs. On May 3, 2024, Arista’s Board of Directors authorized an additional program to repurchase up to $1.2 billion. The actual timing and amount of repurchases will be dependent on market and business conditions, capital requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors.\n\nCompany Highlights\n\nArista Introduces Universal Network Observability – Arista announces CloudVisionⓇ Universal Network ObservabilityTM (CV UNOTM), a modern network observability software offering merging network infrastructure performance and data from compute and server systems-of-record to deliver keen insights into application and workload performance across data center, campus, and wide area networks.\n\nThe New AI Era: Networking for AI and AI for Networking – Arista is delivering both optimal Networking for AI platforms and AI for networking outcomes. AI Etherlink platforms deliver high performance, low latency, fully scheduled, lossless networking as the new unit of currency for AI networks. At the same time AI for networking drives positive outcomes such as security, root cause analysis and observability through AVA.\n\nFinancial Outlook\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, we expect:\n\nRevenue between $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin of approximately 64%; and\n\nNon-GAAP operating margin of approximately 44%.\n\nGuidance for non-GAAP financial measures excludes stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and potential non-recurring charges or benefits. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis because these exclusions can be uncertain or difficult to predict, including stock-based compensation expense which is impacted by the company’s future hiring and retention needs and the future fair market value of the company’s common stock. The actual amount of these exclusions will have a significant impact on the company’s GAAP gross margin and GAAP operating margin.\n\nPrepared Materials and Conference Call Information\n\nArista's executives will discuss the first quarter 2024 financial results on a conference call at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time today. To listen to the call via telephone, dial (888) 330-2502 in the United States or +1 (240) 789-2713 from international locations.

The Dow rose for a sixth-straight session, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lost ground.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the ridesharing firm posted a net loss after reporting hundreds of millions in charges related to revaluations of its investments. Its gross bookings also fell short of forecasts on slowing demand in Latin America and the earlier start dates for the Easter and Ramadan holidays.\n\nShares of Intel (INTC) declined as the chipmaker changed its current quarter guidance after U.S. regulators revoked its license to sell to Chinese telecom Huawei.\n\nTripadvisor (TRIP) shares also plunged as the online travel site said a special committee ruled against a potential merger.\n\nShares of Arista Networks (ANET) jumped as strong demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) products helped the cloud computing networking equipment maker exceed profit and sales estimates. It also raised its guidance and announced a $1.2 billion share repurchase program.\n\nReddit (RDDT) shares took off after the social media platform reported a lower-than-expected loss and soaring revenue on strong ad sales as user traffic hit a record high.

      "# [Arista Networks beats expectations and offers strong guidance on AI demand by MIKE WHEATLEY, DUNCAN RILEY on 2024-11-07](https://siliconangle.com/2024/11/07/arista-networks-beats-expectations-offers-strong-guidance-ai-demand/)\nShares of Arista Networks Inc. fell more than 6% in late-trading after the company delivered strong third-quarter earnings and revenue and offered guidance that came in above expectations.\n\nThe company reported earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $2.40 per share, while its revenue increased 20% from a year earlier to $1.81 billion. The results were much better than expected, with Wall Street analysts looking for earnings of just $2.08 per share on sales of $1.75 billion.\n\nNet income for the quarter came to $747.9 million, up from $545.3 million in the year-ago period.\n\nArista is a rival to the much larger Cisco Systems Inc. in the computer networking industry, focused on selling premium gear such as high-speed switches that accelerate communications between racks of computer servers in corporate data centers. Its largest customers include so-called hyperscaler cloud service providers such as Microsoft Corp. and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., though the company also has a solid footing in the enterprise market, with large companies, educational institutions and government agencies.\n\nThe company has delivered a string of impressive earnings and revenue beats over the last year, as hyperscalers and enterprises alike step up their spending on cloud computing and artificial intelligence-related infrastructure. AI applications need a rapid communications infrastructure to operate effectively, and that’s exactly what Arista provides with its high-end network switches and routers.\n\nArista’s rivals have also benefited from the interest in AI. Last week, Juniper Networks Inc., awaiting approval of an acquisition by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., delivered a similarly strong earnings and revenue beat, citing demand for AI. Arista said earlier this year it expects to generate about $750 million in AI-related revenue.\n\n“Arista remains at the forefront of next generation centers of data across client-to-cloud and AI focused locations,” said Arista Chairperson and Chief Executive Jayshree Ullal (pictured). “Our Q3 2024 results once again demonstrate our continued commitment to customer priorities as well as delivering strong financial results.”\n\nFor the current quarter, Arista sees no sign of the AI demand letting up. It’s anticipating revenue of between $1.85 billion and $1.9 billion, well ahead of the Street’s forecast of $1.8 billion. It also forecast an adjusted operating margin of 44%, compared to the analyst forecast of 43.5%.\n\nIn addition to today’s results, Arista announced plans for a four-to-one stock split, which will g into effect at the close of trading on Dec. 3.\n\nHolger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. said investors will be encouraged to see Arista continues to grow its business, with 20% revenue growth being a very solid performance from a well-established company.\n\n“It was conservative on the cost side, and that resulted in higher profitability and earnings per share, which are all things that investors appreciate,” the analyst said. “That said, the guidance for the current quarter was a tad conservative, and may have raised some concerns given that the AI market is generally growing at around 30% to 40%. Jayshree Ullal may be asked why Arista is not taking better advantage of this demand.”\n\nThe conservative guidance probably explains why Arista’s stock was down in extended trading, although it may also be due to simple profit taking by investors. Prior to today’s move, the shares had gained 83% in the year to date.\n\nPhoto: SiliconANGLE",
