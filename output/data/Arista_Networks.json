      "# [Edge Threat Management – Arista by Arista - Edge Threat Management on 2016-04-15](https://edge.arista.com/solutions/ransomware/)\nWhat is Ransomware?\n\nCyber security threats and attacks are always evolving. Viruses, worms, trojan horses, spyware, adware and scareware have all been around for a long time. One type of malware, however, has been grabbing headlines and creating headaches for users and IT professionals alike: ransomware.\n\nRansomware is defined as a type of malware that creates a restriction of some type on the user’s computer. In order to remove the restriction, the user must pay a ransom, typically in bitcoin. This form of crimeware is unique in that it tries to coerce the user into directly paying the criminal–effectively turning the malware itself into a way for the attacker to profit. Over the past five years, ransomware has become more and more widespread because of the initial success of cybercriminals in convincing victims to pay to recover their files.\n\nHackers often use trojan horses to spread ransomware. A trojan horse (or simply, “trojan”) is any program which disguises itself in order to get a user to install or execute it. Trojans often masquerade as system or software updates, macros or other software add-ons. In reality, they carry malicious payloads that can have any number of undesirable effects: giving the hacker privileges on the computer via a “backdoor”; destroying files or corrupting disks; taking control over computing resources to use some or all of them as part of a “botnet”; or even stealing personally identifiable information like name, address, credit card information or other sensitive data directly or by “keylogging”. In the case of ransomware, the trojan hides the malicious code and tricks the user into executing it. The ransomware then is able to infect the host computer (and possibly all mounted disks and network shares).\n\nNotorious ransomware like WannaCry, Petya, Cryptolocker and Locky all work in similar ways. These widespread exploits all attack files on the victim’s computer and encrypt them with a private key known only to the hacker. This makes the files useless to the victim; they can no longer access the contents without the key. To obtain the key and decrypt the files, the victim must follow the criminal’s instructions to make payment and obtain the decoder.\n\nHow is Ransomware Spread?\n\nRansomware can be distributed through the same vehicles as other malware: software downloads from websites, attachments to emails, and even malicious ads (known as “malvertising”) delivered over online ad networks.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nEven today’s sophisticated malware protection can be circumvented by ransomware. The best approach to security is multi-layered and requires vigilance from both IT professionals and their end users.\n\nAlways keep backups. Data can’t be recovered if it isn’t backed up. Have a strategy in place that covers every user, device and file.\n\nLock down administrative rights. Don’t give users administration rights, even on their own machines, unless it’s absolutely necessary.\n\nStay up to date. Keep systems and apps current with the latest patches to avoid exploits that rely on outdated code.\n\nProtect at the gateway. NG Firewall can block spam, viruses, and phishing attempts. It can also block “phone home” requests made by malware.\n\nKeep every endpoint protected. Gateway protection can’t help when users insert a rogue USB stick. Make sure every endpoint has complete, current security.\n\nIf an email looks suspicious, it probably is. Teach users to trash emails that look like spam. Better yet, show them how to inspect email headers if they’re unsure of the sender.\n\nDon’t open attachments. Unless your users are absolutely, positively sure that they recognize both the sender and the file, it’s better to leave attachments alone. If they do open attachments, they should never enable macros or executables. Suggest other ways to share documents that require authentication and have built-in virus scanning.\n\nRansomware is not going away anytime soon. It is an evolving attack scheme that cybercriminals are pouncing on to gain a quick buck. NG Firewall can stop hackers from gaining access to your devices at the gateway to the network, preventing ransomware from ever reaching your users. NG Firewall is an all-in-one security solution that provides enterprise-grade perimeter security in a way that is easy to buy, use and install. Contact us today to find out how NG Firewall can help keep your network secure.",
      "# [Edge Threat Management – Arista by Arista - Edge Threat Management on 2019-10-15](https://edge.arista.com/micro-edge/)\nBranch Office Connectivity\n\nMicro Edge appliances feature WiFi and LTE connectivity (AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon), Fiber, and multiple WAN ports to provide multiple Internet paths that automatically fail over to eliminate downtime. Securely connect distributed enterprises and remote workers using IPsec VPN, OpenVPN and WireGuardⓇ VPN.\n\nApplication Based Optimization\n\nOptimal predictive path selection technology incorporates a sophisticated cloud component to identify applications at the first packet. This advanced technology enables Micro Edge software to choose the best path for specific applications or categories of network traffic.\n\nEdge Optimization\n\nDeploying Micro Edge at a branch office boosts Internet connectivity with traffic shaping and QoS to prioritize business critical traffic. Real-time performance monitoring with WAN balancing leverages the performance and cost savings of inexpensive Internet connections to eliminate the need for expensive dedicated links such as MPLS.\n\nCloud-based Centralized Management\n\nNetwork administrators using ETM Dashboard gain full visibility of all their NG Firewall and Micro Edge deployments. Cloud-based ETM Dashboard enables you to view appliance network status and location, important events, and reporting data. Configure and push policy templates, WAN rules, and global configuration. Simplify deployment of multiple appliances by connecting appliances with auto-provisioning VPN.\n\nZero Touch Provisioning\n\nUsing ETM Dashboard, network administrators or MSPs can remotely set up and configure single or multiple Micro Edge deployments without having to be on site. Automatic upgrades ensure the latest security updates and enhancements.\n\nSecurity and Threat Prevention\n\nMicro Edge has a stateful firewall, Threat Prevention, Geo-IP Filter and Web Filter which blocks traffic that can cause harm to your network. Encrypted traffic is a hotspot for hackers to hide malware or other malicious code. However, Threat Prevention, Geo-IP Filter and Web Filter can make an assessment even if the traffic is encrypted and block harmful files or transmissions before they get onto the network.",

      "# [Edge Threat Management – Arista by Arista - Edge Threat Management on 2016-02-10](https://edge.arista.com/shop/ssl-inspector/)\nMore and more Internet traffic is being encrypted using HTTPS, which creates a huge blindspot for firewalls. It compromises their ability to analyze traffic, identify threats or handle policy violations.\n\nSSL Inspector solves this problem. Whether it is driven by concerns about personal privacy, or the rise of web applications like Salesforce, Netflix and Facebook, the amount of encrypted Internet traffic has exploded. SSL Inspector puts NG Firewall in the middle of the encrypted traffic, with the ability to decrypt and analyze the data as it passes through.\n\nSSL Inspector creates a specialized certificate on each client. This certificate communicates directly with the gateway which is then able to decrypt HTTPS and SMTP traffic, process, and re-encrypt it on the fly all from within NG Firewall—without ever exposing the decrypted traffic to the network. This enables HTTPS traffic to be inspected in the same way as regular HTTP traffic, meaning that all NG Firewall apps and their rules can be applied.",

This visibility allows administrators to see in real-time what devices are on the network. As the attack surface expands with more IoT devices and users connecting with their personal devices (BYOD), admins need to know as much as possible about the devices connected on the network.\n\nGeo-IP Filter\n\nGeo-IP Filter, also known as geo-blocking, allows administrators to filter traffic by country, and can block traffic to or from a geographic location. Specific countries can be allowed if needed. This security feature provides an additional layer of security and control for network administrators.\n\nDHCP Relay\n\nFor enterprises with many distributed networks, admins may prefer to centrally manage IP assignment via DHCP. In this scenario, each network must be capable of forwarding DHCP requests to a central server via VPN tunnels or dedicated links such as MPLS.\n\nPlease refer to the release notes for more information.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nMicro Edge version 4.3 is available as a free upgrade to customers with a paid subscription. Device Discoverability and Geo-IP Filter is included in the Micro Edge Security software package.\n\nVersion 4.2 Highlights\n\nIPsec VPN\n\nMicro Edge is a lightweight device that extends the network reach to the very edge, and now with IPsec VPN provides a wide variety of connectivity options. In addition to OpenVPN and WireGuard VPN connectivity options, IPsec VPN gives network administrators more flexibility when deploying Micro Edge appliances in their network. IPsec VPN uses the advanced WAN routing capabilities of Micro Edge, so you can leverage the tunnel for routing based on link performance and availability, applications, protocols, networks, and other criteria.\n\nOther updates include support for Japanese and German languages, OpenWrt operating system update, the ability to deploy in the European ETM Dashboard, and updated branding.\n\nPlease see the changelog for a full list of updates in Micro Edge 4.2.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nMicro Edge version 4.2 is available as a free upgrade to customers with a paid subscription.\n\nVersion 4.0 Highlights\n\nWeb Filter\n\nMicro Edge 4.0 (formerly SD-WAN Router) is a lightweight device that extends the network reach to the very perimeter. Micro Edge with Web Filter, provides additional security for networks that need it at branch offices. Web Filter, powered by Webroot BrightcloudⓇ, performs a real-time assessment of the site and blocks access to dangerous, inappropriate or distracting website content to protect the network and increase employee productivity. Web Filter, paired with Threat Prevention, provides multiple layers of security at the network edge.\n\nAdditional updates include performance improvements, nightly automatic configuration backups, and the ability to add static routes for local networks that reside behind other routers on the local network which helps admins who manage segmented networks at branch locations.\n\nPlease see the changelog for a full list of updates in Micro Edge 4.0.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nMicro Edge version 4.0 is available as a free upgrade to customers with a paid subscription.\n\nWeb Filter is included in the Micro Edge Security software package.\n\nVersion 3.1 Highlights\n\nThreat Prevention\n\nThreat Prevention brings a new layer of security to SD-WAN Router that blocks high risk Internet traffic using the Webroot BrightCloud® reputation score associated with the server hosting the service. The reputation score looks at a web page, web page associations and files to determine the likelihood that an IP address may be associated with spam, malware, spyware, web attacks, botnets and other cyber threats. Threat Prevention doesn’t rely on decrypting traffic from secure sites, so it is an efficient and effective tool to prevent cyber attacks even when the data is encrypted.\n\nNew Software Packages\n\nWith the introduction of Threat Prevention, we are now offering two software subscription packages. The entry level or Basic Package includes all of the features of SD-WAN Router to connect, optimize and provide continuity to all your locations. The Security Package adds a new level of security to your network with Threat Prevention. Both packages are available on all the eSeries hardware appliances offered by Untangle.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nSD-WAN Router Basic Package starts at $162/yr. USD, and SD-WAN Router Security Package starts at $260/yr. USD. View the online store for complete pricing and purchasing options.\n\nSD-WAN Router will automatically upgrade to new versions if Automatic Upgrades are turned on, which is the recommended setting. Otherwise, upgrades can be performed from Command Center or through the local web administration. See Upgrading your Untangle SD-WAN Router for more details.\n\nView the online store for complete pricing options.\n\nVersion 3.0 Highlights\n\nUntangle SD-WAN Router 3.0 includes the ability to use WireGuard® VPN which will enable administrators to connect remote locations to NG Firewall or other devices that support WireGuard VPN, via a secure and performant connection. Other updates include adding LTE support for AT&T, improved DHCP server management, ability to manage NIC media speed, and more.\n\nWireGuard VPN\n\nThis new VPN option is easy to implement and increases performance when connecting SD-WAN Router to a network. WireGuard uses state-of-the-art cryptography to secure user networks and delivers fast, performant connectivity, designed for ease-of-implementation and simplicity of configuration. Client-to-site network connectivity is simple to set up with an easy copy and paste between servers.\n\nAT&T LTE\n\nUntangle SD-WAN Router has achieved certification by AT&T to use the provider for LTE services. This improves the ability of SD-WAN Router to provide reliable internet connectivity to remote offices or branches that have unreliable or limited internet service. Users can select AT&T as the LTE provider on the SD-WAN Router e6wl appliance. Untangle SD-WAN Router is now certified to use any of the major carriers in the U.S. (AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon).\n\nPlease see the changelog for a full list of updates in SD-WAN Router 3.0.\n\n“WireGuard” and the “WireGuard” logo are registered trademarks of Jason A.

      "# Post ID 1eyl31e: Cisco vs. Arista Maintenance & Renewals—Which is Better? with +8 score by [(Owlytica, Reddit, 2024-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/1eyl31e/cisco_vs_arista_maintenance_renewalswhich_is/)\nHey everyone, I’m curious about how Cisco’s maintenance and renewal processes compare to Arista’s. With Cisco, we have Smartnet for maintenance and warranties, but I’ve noticed some ongoing issues. For example, Cisco’s records can be inaccurate, leading to situations where they try to renew more maintenance than what the customer actually owns.\n\nAnother challenge is the disconnect between Cisco DNA licensing and the associated hardware, especially when a customer has an Enterprise Agreement (EA). When renewals come around, Cisco sometimes charges based on what’s been downloaded rather than what’s been consumed, which can be frustrating.\n\nI’m wondering if Arista has similar challenges, or if their maintenance and renewals process is more straightforward. Is Arista easier—or perhaps even harder—to manage from a maintenance and renewals perspective? Cisco has the Ready Report to export records, but it’s often outdated and inaccurate. Does Arista deal with these kinds of issues as well?\n\nWould love to hear your experiences\n\n## Comment ID ljdyg0e with +16 score by [(sryan2k1, Reddit, 2024-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/1eyl31e/cisco_vs_arista_maintenance_renewalswhich_is/ljdyg0e/) (in reply to ID 1eyl31e):\nArista has about 5 license levels that are all very clearly laid out about what features require what licenses.\n\n[https://www.arista.com/en/support/product-documentation/eos-feature-licensing/eos-platform-licensing](https://www.arista.com/en/support/product-documentation/eos-feature-licensing/eos-platform-licensing)\n\nNo licensing is mandatory (Base is included with the price of the device), there is no on box licensing (all honor based) Edit - Apparently MACSec is enforced, I assume due to legal/regulatory reasons though and not because they really wanted to. \n\n\n\nThe renewals are single line item SKUs priced per month with the quantity needed for each model/coverage type. (For example if you have two 7280R3's with 4 hour support and 10 720XPs with NBD you'd have a line item for 7280R3 - 4 Hour quantity 24 (2 units \\* 12 months) and another line item for 720XP NBD quantity 120, assuming you're buying in year chunks)\n\nYou tell me what you think is better.\n\n### Comment ID ljfgvv1 with +4 score by [(beskone, Reddit, 2024-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/1eyl31e/cisco_vs_arista_maintenance_renewalswhich_is/ljfgvv1/) (in reply to ID ljdyg0e):\nArista is pretty much Base or L3 Advanced + Support\n\nand even then L3 Advanced is honor system.

That is if you are on a budget then Arista might not be your first choice (on the other hand neither will Cisco, Juniper and a few others either).\n\n- Can be somewhat tricky to find out what is the most optimal model for your usecase since there are many variants of each model. Its not like back in the days where you had Cisco 29xx for L2-switching, 35xx for L3-switching and 65xx for chassibased L3 and thats it.

Instead they use MLAG which in my opinion is much better as you don’t have the management plane as a single point of failure, similar to Nexus. When you reboot an Arista switch in an MLAG setup don’t worry if ports are shutdown for the first few minutes.

I purchased an Arista 7050-TX-64-R recently, and I am really struggling to understand how to configure it. I have a decent understanding of Linux and networking in general, but every tutorial I can find appears to start one step ahead of what I can understand.\n\nI've done a substantial amount of googling, and everything I can find points to using ZTP or a Serial connection. I have read that the switch should automatically use ZTP, but I never see it attempt to get an IP address from my router's DHCP. I also do not have any way to connect over serial, as not of my machines have a serial port. Setting that aside, I have absolutely no idea how to create a configuration file, and have been unable to find anything that helps me do that.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, I've read somewhere that the fans can be set to 30%, and would really like to at least manage that.\n\n## Comment ID lgxzhog with +5 score by [(jeff6strings, Reddit, 2024-08-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/1em5qgy/need_help_with_configuration_basics/lgxzhog/) (in reply to ID 1em5qgy):\nA lot of good information here.\n\nI wrote an article comparing Cisco and Arista, which may help if you have experience with Cisco.

It has huge off-chip buffers that are divided up into exclusive pools per interface, versus the dynamically shared pools of a X-based (Trident or Tomahawk) switch. \n\nUsing the \"Buffer Size = Link Speed x RTT\" algorithm, longer distance links need bigger buffers. That's why DC switches often have dozens of megabytes of buffer shared between all interfaces, and routers will generally have dozens to hundreds of megabytes of buffer *per interface*. \n\nSome DC workloads do benefit from these really large buffers, so the Jericho chip is used in DC switches for those workloads. \n\nDC and campus switches typically have smaller L3 forwarding tables, several dozen thousand LPM (longest-prefix match) entries, while they have larger L2 forwarding tables for MAC addresses and host routes. Routers typically have very small L2 tables, and extremely large L3 tables (over a million entries is table stakes these days given what the public BGP table is doing). But since the chips are getting more feature-rich and more multi-purpose, many FEs/ASICs will have flexible tables so you can arrange L2/L3 entries around. \n\nSo basically it comes to how many ports do you have and at what speed. \n\nL2? L3? Like FE Ken says: \"My job is *forward*\"\n\n## Comment ID kd5nd55 with +2 score by [(Apachez, Reddit, 2023-12-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/18gplkl/advertised_as_switch_router/kd5nd55/) (in reply to ID 18gplkl):\nTechnically a device who forwards based on MAC information aka Layer2 is considered to be a switch while a device who forwards based on IP information aka Layer3 is considered to be a router.\n\nAs others have mentioned what then actually defines if lets say a Arista 7280SR is to be called a switch or a router depends on how you then set it up.\n\nTo add to this confusion there is also the term \"L3-switch\" which I think fits Arista devices better.\n\nThat is a switch who also knows how to route and supports not only static routing but also various dynamic routing protocols (OSPF, ISIS, BGP etc).\n\nArista themselves referes to their devices as \"switches\" with routing capabilities.\n\nTo me today the difference between a L3-switch (which I would like to call Arista 7000 series) vs a router is what type of protocols the devices supports at Layer1.\n\nFor example SDH, DSL and whatelse. That is a routing device that only supports Ethernet I would refer that to be a L3-switch while a device who also supports SDH, DSL etc I would lean to call that a router.\n\nSomething else I think a router is capable of which a L3-switch isnt is to perform network address translation aka NAT (incl SNAT and DNAT).\n\nAnother difference is that a \"true\" router often is very bad at switching between interfaces. That is you can normally not configure a vlan and attach that to the interface with \"switchport\" (or similar) command.\n\nWhat you can do on a \"true\" router if you still want to have tagged vlan is to create a subinterface where the subinterface id becomes the VLAN id to tag egress frames with.\n\nThat is on a L3-switch something like this:\n\n    interface vlan11\n    ip address 10.0.11.1/24\n    \n    interface vlan22\n    ip address 10.0.22.1/24\n    \n    interface vlan33\n    ip address 10.0.33.1/24\n    \n    interface gi 1/0/1\n    mode switchport trunk\n    switchport allowed vlan 11, 22, 33\n    switchport native vlan 11\n\nwould be equal to this on a \"true\" router:\n\n    interface gi 1/0/1\n    ip address 10.0.11.1/24\n    \n    interface gi 1/0/1.22\n    encapsulation dot1q\n    ip address 10.0.22.1/24\n    \n    interface gi 1/0/1.33\n    encapsulation dot1q\n    ip address 10.0.33.1/24\n\nThat is vlan11 is untagged while while 22 and 33 are tagged on interface gi 1/0/1. Since IP addresses are configured for all vlans in this example the device will also (if \"ip routing\" is enabled) automatically route between this directly connected networks.\n\nSo in your case a Arista 7280SR will be great for routing and dealing with BGP but it will fail at doing NAT. So for that you would either need two devices (preferly a firewall doing the NAT) or get something else if you want to do everything in a single device.\n\nMikrotik have some options (just dig into their datasheets since many of their devices even if they can do routing they have terrible performance since they are mainly glorified switches but they do have models which have good L3 performance aswell) and another one is to go software based routing such as VyOS (get a random x86 box with 2 or more nics and enough of RAM and CPU and off you go).\n\n## Comment ID kd2io6l with +2 score by [(MKeb, Reddit, 2023-12-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/18gplkl/advertised_as_switch_router/kd2io6l/) (in reply to ID 18gplkl):\nNo nat on 7280 in general.

If not, then you're looking at the 7010T/7020TR, with the possibility of the 7050TX-72Q for the 40Gig uplinks. \nReal difference there is the 7020TR is a 3GB deep buffer switch, while the 7010T is a low speed switch.\n\nThe 9500 is Cisco's direct line competitor with the 7280/7050 line.  7280 is your deep buffers, 7050 is your cut-thru switching.  Since the 9500 is Broadcom based, like the Aristas, you can make easy comparisons.\n\nC9500-32C == 7050CX3-32S\n\nC9500-32QC == 7050CX3-32S (QSFP can use QSFP+)\n\nC9500-48Y4C == 7050CX3-48YC8\n\n## Comment ID gppijzm with +1 score by [(Apachez, Reddit, 2021-03-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/lwd3p2/in_search_of_arista_equivalents_to_cisco_9200/gppijzm/) (in reply to ID lwd3p2):\nDepends on what your needs are.\n\nThe quick reference pdf is often a good start who have all the models sum up in a matrix so you can more easily compare them depending on what you are looking for (number of interfaces, speed of interfaces, buffersizes, latency, size of the box etc):\n\nhttps://www.arista.com/assets/data/pdf/AristaProductQuickReferenceGuide.pdf",

      "# [CloudVision delivers Modern Network Operating Model across the Enterprise by Arista Networks, Whitney Sisler on 2024-10-10](https://www.arista.com/en/company/news/press-release/20387-pr-20240924)\nMulti-domain Network-as-a-Service spans data center, campus, and wide area networks\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. – September 24, 2024— Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET), a leading provider of cloud and AI networking solutions, today announced significant new capabilities in its CloudVision® platform, enabling a modern network operating model for customers. Arista’s CloudVision dramatically simplifies operations with automation, observability and zero trust security capabilities across all enterprise networking domains, from campus to data center, WAN, and cloud. This uniform approach helps enterprises save operational expenses by removing traditional network operational silos while delivering reliable and resilient networks.\n\n“Having first deployed CloudVision in our Data Center, we now have expanded CloudVision to be the automation and day-to-day operations platform for our campus network as well,” said Haim Inger, CTO and VP of Infrastructure at Clal Insurance. ”The benefit of having a single operating model across our enterprise network means reduced training efforts, better control of our potential security risk and faster issue resolution.”\n\nThe Platform for a Modern Network Operating Model\n\nArista CloudVision is a multi-domain management platform that eliminates the burden of different network operating models forced on customers by traditional network vendors. Instead, customers benefit from consistent network design, automation workflows, troubleshooting techniques, and expertise across network domains.\n\nThis modern network operating model is derived from Arista’s experience with the largest cloud service providers, who demand the highest quality, reliability, and lack of downtime. CloudVision is democratizing these cloud principles and making them available to customers of all sizes, reducing the cost of network operations, increasing network uptime, and improving security.\n\nBuilt on Arista’s unified Network Data Lake (NetDL™) architecture, CloudVision aggregates data from the entire enterprise in one location for advanced automation and analytics and applies predictive insights via Arista Autonomous Virtual Assist (Arista AVA™). This multi-domain approach, expanded with domain-specific capabilities, addresses the needs of the end-to-end enterprise modern networks.\n\nCloudVision for the Data Center\n\nCloudVision established its foundation in the data center, addressing comprehensive network operations tasks for engineers responsible for operating mission-critical data center environments. State-streaming telemetry continues to give the data center operator unmatched visibility for faster mean-time-to resolution and automated compliance reporting. Arista Validated Design (AVD) driven DevOps pipeline integrations automate the deployment of large network configurations.\n\nCloudVision's latest feature set includes holistic, 360-degree observability by integrating application and 3rd-party data into Arista's NetDL. CloudVision Universal Network Observability™ (CV UNO™) leverages advanced machine learning for event correlations across topology-based, time-based, and function-based dimensions. CV UNO drastically accelerates issue detection, inference and resolution, ensuring faster and more precise troubleshooting of application-related problems.\n\nCloudVision for the Campus Center\n\nCloudVision continues the expansion into the enterprise campus with new guided workflows that address the broader enterprise operator personas. These prescriptive workflows simplify end-to-end operations of campus networks, enabling the operator to efficiently build networks, including day zero pre-provisioning and day one onboarding as well as speeding up day two operations such as making port changes, adding/removing networks, or running diagnostics for quicker troubleshooting.\n\nCloudVision also uses generative artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to ease network management and provide faster problem resolution. CloudVision's Ask AVA capabilities allow the operator to ask CloudVision natural language questions, enabling network operators of all levels to navigate the platform and quickly find exactly what they need.\n\nCloudVision for the WAN Center\n\nCloudVision has expanded further to the enterprise WAN network domain. WAN operator dashboards combine telemetry data for all interconnect networks, uniquely providing a single, end-to-end operational view across the enterprise.\n\nCloudVision Pathfinder modernizes WAN management and provisioning, aligning the operating model with visualization and orchestration across all network transport domains. This enables a profound shift from legacy CLI configuration to a model where configuration and traffic engineering are automatically generated, tested, and deployed, resulting in a self-healing network.\n\nCloudVision for the Zero Trust Network\n\nEnterprise-wide zero trust networking across multiple network domains requires a flexible identity-based microsegmentation service enforced in the distributed network. CloudVision delivers multi-domain orchestration and monitoring services of zero trust policies based on microperimeters, with dedicated, easy to use security dashboards to manage the end-to-end microsegmentation lifecycle across the enterprise. The service integrates with the broader Arista Zero Trust Networking solution, including Arista CloudVision, CV AGNI™ and Arista NDR. It also integrates with industry-leading firewalls such as Palo Alto Networks, IT service management (ITSM) such as ServiceNow, and virtualization platforms such as VMware.\n\nCustomers can therefore visualize, operate, and secure the entire enterprise network, from the client to the campus, the cloud, and the data center.\n\nAvailability\n\nArista CloudVision is available now, including CloudVision UNO, CloudVision Pathfinder, and Multi-Domain Segmentation Services, with these latest CloudVision features available in Q4 2024. For more information, please visit CloudVision on arista.com.\n\nTo read more about this announcement, please check out this blog by Andre Pech, Vice President of Software Engineering for Arista.\n\nAbout Arista\n\nArista Networks is an industry leader in data-driven, client-to-cloud networking for large AI, data center, campus and routing environments.

      "# [Nvidia, Arista Networks Square Off In AI Networking Battle by REINHARDT KRAUSE, Reinhardt-Krause, Investor's Business Daily on 2024-08-22](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-arista-networks-ai-networking-battle/)\nNvidia (NVDA) and Arista Networks (ANET) have thrived as sellers of high-end technology to cloud computing giants. But now the two companies are competing head-on for the first time as their customers upgrade their internet data centers for artificial intelligence.\n\n↑ X NOW PLAYING How Nvidia Is Injecting AI Into The Health Care Industry\n\nComing into the heavyweight match, Nvidia is the dominant supplier of AI accelerator chips that turbocharge the processing power of computer servers. Meanwhile, Arista garners revenue from computer switches and routers that work inside data centers and connect racks of servers with long-distance communications networks.\n\nAmid the emergence of \"generative\" AI, what's new is that cloud computing giants are building new data centers with clusters of AI computer servers. Those clusters may scale to hundreds or thousands of servers. And those AI server clusters, in turn, are connected with high-bandwidth computer networking technology.\n\nAI Ethernet Market To Jump\n\nFurther, cloud computer giants are eyeing a new version of Ethernet networking technology to connect the clusters of AI servers. Market research firm 650 Group forecasts that the \"back end\" AI Ethernet market will soar to $8.74 billion in revenue by 2028, up from $577 million in 2023.\n\n\"The good news is that the market is growing so fast and will be so large that in absolute dollars, Arista, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Nvidia will all show huge growth,\" said Alan Weckel, analyst at 650 Group.\n\nBut that doesn't mean a fierce marketing battle isn't on the horizon. Nvidia and Arista both aim to win big contracts from cloud computing giants Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) as well as other big spenders on AI infrastructure, such as Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA) and Apple (AAPL).\n\nAlso, Nvidia and Arista have different strengths to leverage amid the AI battle.\n\n\"The market share question is a little tough,\" Weckel told IBD. \"Nvidia is coming into Ethernet as a challenger with little existing market share. Therefore, they will be a share taker. Arista and Cisco have incumbency. This will likely cause a very tight position between vendors ranking one, two and three.\"\n\nEthernet Overtakes InfiniBand\n\nHowever, it's not all gravy for Nvidia. New AI Ethernet network switches compete with Nvidia's InfiniBand chips, which whisk data from computer servers to storage devices. Nvidia acquired InfiniBand chipmaker Mellanox for $6.9 billion in 2020.\n\nAnalysts say Nvidia will be able to offer product bundles — Ethernet networking devices with its artificial intelligence accelerator chips. Nvidia's overall strategy is providing customers with an AI ecosystem, including its CUDA software platform for developing AI apps and workloads.\n\nWhile Nvidia aims to provide a broad AI ecosystem to customers, the flip side is that some cloud computing buyers may not want to be locked in to one supplier.\n\n\"While Nvidia's pitch of a fully integrated system will win some fans, hyperscalers and enterprises will continue to push toward multi-vendor approaches (and open ecosystems), driving demand for Arista,\" William Blair analyst Sebastien Naji said in a report.\n\nFurther, Nvidia stock has jumped 162% in 2024, as of Aug. 19. Arista stock has climbed 49%. Also, Nvidia and Arista are among the top AI stocks to watch.\n\nArista, Cisco, HPE Back Consortium\n\nIn 2023, Arista joined with Cisco, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and other companies to form the Ultra Ethernet Consortium. The consortium now has over 60 member companies. Other players in the AI Ethernet networking market include Celestica (CLS) and Nokia (NOK).\n\n\"The AI back-end network buildout to connect server clusters is a net new opportunity,\" said Dell'Oro analyst Sameh Boujelbene. \"Almost everyone should be able to benefit to different degrees.\"\n\nBoujelbene said Nvidia should be given credit for pivoting from InfiniBand to Ethernet. \"They saw it coming,\" she said. \"Their marketing strategy has shifted.\"\n\nWhile some cloud computing titans may want to reduce their reliance on Nvidia, Boujelbene added that Nvidia still offers the best product bundle.\n\nArista AI Revenue Forecast\n\nMeanwhile, Arista management has forecast $750 million in AI-related sales for 2025, with a good chunk of that coming from Ethernet networking.\n\n\"We consider Arista's AI forecast reasonable, but suspect bulls expect two times or more (revenue),\" Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold said in a report.\n\n\"Arista has announced a suite of products optimized and designed specifically for AI clusters called Etherlink AI, including a software agent that runs on third-party network cards (from members of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium as well as Nvidia), and this could accelerate traction.\"\n\nIn addition, Arista has designed its Ethernet platform to work with AI accelerator chips from Broadcom (AVGO), AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Broadcom and Arista, in fact, have formed an AI marketing partnership.\n\nAt 650 Group, Weckel says Arista's popular EOS networking operating system could give it an edge over Nvidia and Cisco.\n\nNvidia Stock: Spectrum-X Ramps Up\n\nRaymond James' Leopold said the debate on Wall Street is no longer about market share shifting to Ethernet from InfiniBand. Instead, the debate is who will win the lion's share of the AI Ethernet market.\n\nHe noted that Nvidia has predicted that Spectrum-X, its Ethernet brand, will become a multibillion-dollar product line within a year.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia has delayed shipments of its next-generation Blackwell B200 AI chips because of a manufacturing issue. Mass shipments to cloud computing clients will not take place until early 2025.\n\nHowever, that's not expected to slow demand for its Spectrum-X Ethernet devices. Tesla could be Nvidia's initial customer, analysts say.\n\nArista's two biggest customers for computer network switches are Microsoft and Meta. Arista hasn't told Wall Street analysts whether they're buying Ethernet networking devices. On its second-quarter earnings call, Arista said it has four major AI networking trials underway.\n\nAt Morgan Stanley, analyst Meta Marshall said in a report: \"We would note the company has said these four major AI trials are with Cloud Titans and could be for clusters that could approach 100,000 GPUs, but noted there are multiple other major AI trials happening.\"\n\nFollow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nWant To Trade Options?

      "# [CloudVision Delivers Modern Network Operating Model Across the Enterprise by Arista Networks, StockTitan on 2024-09-24](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/ANET/cloud-vision-delivers-modern-network-operating-model-across-the-fpl9bra3cupm.html)\n09/24/2024 - 10:16 AM\n\nMulti-domain Network-as-a-Service spans data center, campus, and wide area networks\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET), a leading provider of cloud and AI networking solutions, today announced significant new capabilities in its CloudVision® platform, enabling a modern network operating model for customers. Arista’s CloudVision dramatically simplifies operations with automation, observability and zero trust security capabilities across all enterprise networking domains, from campus to data center, WAN, and cloud. This uniform approach helps enterprises save operational expenses by removing traditional network operational silos while delivering reliable and resilient networks.\n\n“Having first deployed CloudVision in our Data Center, we now have expanded CloudVision to be the automation and day-to-day operations platform for our campus network as well,” said Haim Inger, CTO and VP of Infrastructure at Clal Insurance. ”The benefit of having a single operating model across our enterprise network means reduced training efforts, better control of our potential security risk and faster issue resolution.”\n\nThe Platform for a Modern Network Operating Model\n\nArista CloudVision is a multi-domain management platform that eliminates the burden of different network operating models forced on customers by traditional network vendors. Instead, customers benefit from consistent network design, automation workflows, troubleshooting techniques, and expertise across network domains.\n\nThis modern network operating model is derived from Arista’s experience with the largest cloud service providers, who demand the highest quality, reliability, and lack of downtime. CloudVision is democratizing these cloud principles and making them available to customers of all sizes, reducing the cost of network operations, increasing network uptime, and improving security.\n\nBuilt on Arista’s unified Network Data Lake (NetDL™) architecture, CloudVision aggregates data from the entire enterprise in one location for advanced automation and analytics and applies predictive insights via Arista Autonomous Virtual Assist (Arista AVA™). This multi-domain approach, expanded with domain-specific capabilities, addresses the needs of the end-to-end enterprise modern networks.\n\nCloudVision for the Data Center\n\nCloudVision established its foundation in the data center, addressing comprehensive network operations tasks for engineers responsible for operating mission-critical data center environments. State-streaming telemetry continues to give the data center operator unmatched visibility for faster mean-time-to resolution and automated compliance reporting. Arista Validated Design (AVD) driven DevOps pipeline integrations automate the deployment of large network configurations.\n\nCloudVision's latest feature set includes holistic, 360-degree observability by integrating application and 3rd-party data into Arista's NetDL. CloudVision Universal Network Observability™ (CV UNO™) leverages advanced machine learning for event correlations across topology-based, time-based, and function-based dimensions. CV UNO drastically accelerates issue detection, inference and resolution, ensuring faster and more precise troubleshooting of application-related problems.\n\nCloudVision for the Campus Center\n\nCloudVision continues the expansion into the enterprise campus with new guided workflows that address the broader enterprise operator personas. These prescriptive workflows simplify end-to-end operations of campus networks, enabling the operator to efficiently build networks, including day zero pre-provisioning and day one onboarding as well as speeding up day two operations such as making port changes, adding/removing networks, or running diagnostics for quicker troubleshooting.\n\nCloudVision also uses generative artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to ease network management and provide faster problem resolution. CloudVision's Ask AVA capabilities allow the operator to ask CloudVision natural language questions, enabling network operators of all levels to navigate the platform and quickly find exactly what they need.\n\nCloudVision for the WAN Center\n\nCloudVision has expanded further to the enterprise WAN network domain. WAN operator dashboards combine telemetry data for all interconnect networks, uniquely providing a single, end-to-end operational view across the enterprise.\n\nCloudVision Pathfinder modernizes WAN management and provisioning, aligning the operating model with visualization and orchestration across all network transport domains. This enables a profound shift from legacy CLI configuration to a model where configuration and traffic engineering are automatically generated, tested, and deployed, resulting in a self-healing network.\n\nCloudVision for the Zero Trust Network\n\nEnterprise-wide zero trust networking across multiple network domains requires a flexible identity-based microsegmentation service enforced in the distributed network. CloudVision delivers multi-domain orchestration and monitoring services of zero trust policies based on microperimeters, with dedicated, easy to use security dashboards to manage the end-to-end microsegmentation lifecycle across the enterprise. The service integrates with the broader Arista Zero Trust Networking solution, including Arista CloudVision, CV AGNI™ and Arista NDR. It also integrates with industry-leading firewalls such as Palo Alto Networks, IT service management (ITSM) such as ServiceNow, and virtualization platforms such as VMware.\n\nCustomers can therefore visualize, operate, and secure the entire enterprise network, from the client to the campus, the cloud, and the data center.\n\nAvailability\n\nArista CloudVision is available now, including CloudVision UNO, CloudVision Pathfinder, and Multi-Domain Segmentation Services, with these latest CloudVision features available in Q4 2024.

      "# [Arista Networks beats expectations and offers strong guidance on AI demand by MIKE WHEATLEY, DUNCAN RILEY, MARIA DEUTSCHER on 2024-11-07](https://siliconangle.com/2024/11/07/arista-networks-beats-expectations-offers-strong-guidance-ai-demand/)\nShares of Arista Networks Inc. fell more than 6% in late-trading after the company delivered strong third-quarter earnings and revenue and offered guidance that came in above expectations.\n\nThe company reported earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $2.40 per share, while its revenue increased 20% from a year earlier to $1.81 billion. The results were much better than expected, with Wall Street analysts looking for earnings of just $2.08 per share on sales of $1.75 billion.\n\nNet income for the quarter came to $747.9 million, up from $545.3 million in the year-ago period.\n\nArista is a rival to the much larger Cisco Systems Inc. in the computer networking industry, focused on selling premium gear such as high-speed switches that accelerate communications between racks of computer servers in corporate data centers. Its largest customers include so-called hyperscaler cloud service providers such as Microsoft Corp. and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., though the company also has a solid footing in the enterprise market, with large companies, educational institutions and government agencies.\n\nThe company has delivered a string of impressive earnings and revenue beats over the last year, as hyperscalers and enterprises alike step up their spending on cloud computing and artificial intelligence-related infrastructure. AI applications need a rapid communications infrastructure to operate effectively, and that’s exactly what Arista provides with its high-end network switches and routers.\n\nArista’s rivals have also benefited from the interest in AI. Last week, Juniper Networks Inc., awaiting approval of an acquisition by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., delivered a similarly strong earnings and revenue beat, citing demand for AI. Arista said earlier this year it expects to generate about $750 million in AI-related revenue.\n\n“Arista remains at the forefront of next generation centers of data across client-to-cloud and AI focused locations,” said Arista Chairperson and Chief Executive Jayshree Ullal (pictured). “Our Q3 2024 results once again demonstrate our continued commitment to customer priorities as well as delivering strong financial results.”\n\nFor the current quarter, Arista sees no sign of the AI demand letting up. It’s anticipating revenue of between $1.85 billion and $1.9 billion, well ahead of the Street’s forecast of $1.8 billion. It also forecast an adjusted operating margin of 44%, compared to the analyst forecast of 43.5%.\n\nIn addition to today’s results, Arista announced plans for a four-to-one stock split, which will g into effect at the close of trading on Dec. 3.\n\nHolger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. said investors will be encouraged to see Arista continues to grow its business, with 20% revenue growth being a very solid performance from a well-established company.\n\n“It was conservative on the cost side, and that resulted in higher profitability and earnings per share, which are all things that investors appreciate,” the analyst said. “That said, the guidance for the current quarter was a tad conservative, and may have raised some concerns given that the AI market is generally growing at around 30% to 40%. Jayshree Ullal may be asked why Arista is not taking better advantage of this demand.”\n\nThe conservative guidance probably explains why Arista’s stock was down in extended trading, although it may also be due to simple profit taking by investors. Prior to today’s move, the shares had gained 83% in the year to date.\n\nPhoto: SiliconANGLE",
      "# [Arista Networks by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2011-10-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arista_Networks)\nAmerican information technology company\n\nArista Networks, Inc. (formerly Arastra)[3] is an American computer networking company headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The company designs and sells multilayer network switches to deliver software-defined networking (SDN) for large datacenter, cloud computing, high-performance computing, and high-frequency trading environments. These products include 10/25/40/50/100/200/400/800 gigabit low-latency cut-through Ethernet switches. Arista's Linux-based network operating system, Extensible Operating System (EOS), runs on all Arista products.\n\nCorporate history\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2004, Andy Bechtolsheim, Kenneth Duda and David Cheriton founded Arastra (later renamed Arista[3]). Bechtolsheim and Cheriton were able to fund the company themselves.[4] In May 2008, Jayshree Ullal left Cisco after 15 years at the firm. She was appointed CEO of Arista in October 2008.[5]\n\nIn June 2014, Arista Networks had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ANET.[6]\n\nIn December 2014, Cisco filed two lawsuits against Arista alleging intellectual property infringement.,[7] and the United States International Trade Commission issued limited exclusion and cease-and-desist orders concerning two of the features patented by Cisco[8] and upheld an import ban on infringing products.[9] In 2016, on appeal, the ban was reversed following product changes and two overturned Cisco patents, and Cisco's claim was dismissed.[10][11] In August 2018, Arista agreed to pay Cisco US$400 million as part of a settlement that included a release for all claims of infringement by Cisco, dismissal of Arista's antitrust claims against Cisco, and a 5-year stand-down between the companies.[12]\n\nIn August 2018, Arista Networks acquired Mojo Networks.[13] In September 2018, Arista Networks acquired Metamako and integrated their low latency product line as the 7130 series.[14] In February 2020, Arista acquired Big Switch Networks.[15] In October 2020, Arista acquired Awake Security.[16]\n\nArista's CEO, Jayshree Ullal, was named to Barron's list of World's Best CEOs in 2018 and 2019.[17]\n\nIn August 2022, Arista Networks acquired Pluribus Networks, a unified cloud network company, for an undisclosed sum.[18]\n\nProducts\n\n[edit]\n\nExtensible Operating System\n\n[edit]\n\nOperating system\n\nExtensible Operating System (EOS)DeveloperArista NetworksWritten inC, C++, Python, Assembly, GoOS familyNetwork operating systemWorking stateCurrentSource modelOpen source and closed-sourceInitial release2004; 20 years ago ( )Marketing targetComputer networksAvailable inEnglishPlatformsIA-32, x86-64Kernel typeMonolithicDefault\n\nuser interfaceCommand-lineLicenseOpen source and ProprietaryOfficial websitewww .arista .com /en /products /eos\n\nEOS is Arista's network operating system, and comes as one image that runs across all Arista devices[19] or in a virtual machine (VM).[20] EOS runs on an unmodified Linux kernel with a userland that is initially Fedora-based.[21] The userland has since been rebased on CentOS and later, AlmaLinux.[22] There are more than 100 independent regular processes, called agents, responsible for different aspects and features of the switch, including drivers that manage the switching application-specific integrated circuit (ASICs), the command-line interface (CLI), Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Spanning Tree Protocol, and various routing protocols. All the state of the switch and its various protocols is centralized in another process, called Sysdb. Separating processing (carried by the agents) from the state (in Sysdb) gives EOS two important properties. The first is software fault containment, which means that if a software fault occurs, any damage is limited to one agent.[23][24] The second is stateful restarts, since the state is stored in Sysdb, when an agent restarts it picks up where it left off.[24] Since agents are independent processes, they can also be upgraded while the switch is running (a feature called ISSU – In-Service Software Upgrade).\n\nThe fact that EOS runs on Linux allows the usage of common Linux tools on the switch itself, such as tcpdump or configuration management systems. EOS provides extensive application programming interfaces (APIs) to communicate with and control all aspects of the switch. To showcase EOS' extensibility, Arista developed a module named CloudVision[25] that extends the CLI to use Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as a shared message bus to manage and configure switches.[26] This was implemented simply by integrating an existing open-source XMPP Python library with the CLI.\n\nProgrammability\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to all the standard programming and scripting abilities traditionally available in a Linux environment, EOS can be programmed using different mechanisms:\n\nAdvanced Event Management[27] can be used to react to various events and automatically trigger CLI commands, execute arbitrary scripts or send alerts when state changes occur in the switch, such as an interface going down or a virtual machine migrating to another host.\n\nEvent Monitor tracks changes made to the medium access control (MAC), Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), and routing table in a local SQLite database for later querying using standard Structured Query Language (SQL) queries.[28]\n\neAPI (External API)[29] offers a versioned JSON-RPC interface to execute CLI commands and retrieve their output in structured JSON objects.\n\nEthernet switches\n\n[edit]\n\nArista's product line can be separated into different product families:\n\n7500R series: Modular chassis with a virtual output queueing (VOQ) fabric supporting from 4 to 16 store and forward line cards delivering line-rate non-blocking 10GbE, 40GbE, and 100GbE[30] performance in a 150 Tbit/s fabric supporting a maximum of 576 100GbE ports with 384 GB of packet buffer.[31] Each 100GbE ports can also operate as 40GbE or 4x10GbE ports,[32] thus effectively providing 2304 line-rate 10GbE ports with large routing tables.\n\n7300X, 7300X3 and 7320X series: Modular chassis with 4 or 8 line cards in a choice of 10G, 40G and 100G options with 6.4 Tbit/s of capacity per line card, for a fabric totaling up to 50 Tbit/s of capacity for up to 1024 10GbE ports.[33] Unlike the 7500 series, 10GBASE-T is available on 7300 series line cards.\n\n7280R series: 1U and 2U systems with a common architecture[34] to the 7500R Series,[35] deep buffer VOQ and large routing tables. Many different speed and port combinations from 10GbE to 100GbE.[36]\n\n7200X series: 2U low-latency high-density line-rate 100GbE and 40GbE switches, with up to 12.8 Tbit/s of forwarding capacity.[37][38][39]\n\n7170 Series: High Performance Multi-function Programmable Platforms,[40] a set of fixed 100G platforms based on Barefoot[41] Tofino[42] packet processor enabling the data plane to be customized using EOS and P4 profiles.\n\n7160 series: 1U programmable high performance range of 10 GbE, 25 GbE and 100 GbE with the support for AlgoMatch[43] technology and a software upgradeable packet processor\n\n7150S series: 1U ultra-low latency cut-through line-rate 10 Gb switches. Port-to-port latency is sub-380ns, regardless of the frame size.[44] Unlike the earlier 7100 series, the switch silicon can be re-programmed[45] to add new features that work at wire-speed, such as Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) or network address translation (NAT/PAT).\n\n7130 series (7130, 7130L, 7130E): 1U and 2U ultra-low latency Layer 1 switch and programmable switches.[46] Layer 1 switching enables mirroring and software-defined port routing with port-to-port latency starting from 4ns, depending on physical distance. The E and L variants allow running custom FPGA applications directly on the switch with a port-to-FPGA latency as low as 3ns. This series comes from the original Metamako product line acquired by Arista Networks in 2018 and runs a combination of MOS and Arista EOS operating systems.\n\n7050X and 7060X series: 1U and 2U low-latency cut-through line-rate 10GbE/25GbE, 40GbE and 100GbE switches. This product line offers higher port density than the 7150 series, in a wider choice of port options and interface speeds at the expense of slightly increased latency (1µs or less). The 7050X and 7060X Series are based on Broadcom Trident and Tomahawk merchant silicon.[47]\n\n7020R series: 1U store and forward line-rate with a choice of either a 1 Gb top-of-rack switch, with 6x10 Gb uplinks or a 10G with 100G uplinks. These switches use a Deep Buffer architecture, with 3 GB of packet memory.[48]\n\n7010 series: 1U low power (52W) line-rate 1 Gb top-of-rack switch, with 4x10 Gb uplinks.[49]\n\nThe low-latency of Arista switches has made them prevalent in high-frequency trading environments, such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange[50] (largest U.S. options exchange) and RBC Capital Markets.[51] As of October 2009, one third of its customers were big Wall Street firms.[52]\n\nArista's devices are multilayer switches, which support a range of layer 3 protocols,[53] including IGMP, Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), IS-IS, and OpenFlow. The switches are also capable of layer 3 or layer 4 equal-cost multi-path routing (ECMP), and applying per-port L3/L4 access-control lists (ACLs) entirely in hardware.\n\nIn November 2013, Arista Networks introduced the Spline network, combining leaf and spine architectures into a single-tier network, aiming to cut operating costs.[54]\n\nArista Community Central\n\n[edit]\n\nArista Community Central is a centralized resource created by Arista Networks for customers, partners, and technical professionals.

      "# [Why Broadcom, Arista Networks, and Rambus Fell Today by Billy Duberstein, www.facebook.com on 2024-04-02](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/04/02/why-broadcom-arista-networks-and-rambus-fell-today/)\nShares of artificial intelligence (AI)-related tech stocks Broadcom (AVGO -2.70%), Arista Networks (ANET -1.80%), and Rambus (RMBS -1.77%) were all down in Tuesday trading, off by 2.7%, 3.7%, and 3.9%, respectively, as of 1 p.m. ET.\n\nThere wasn't much material news around these stocks today, but certainly a jump in long-term bond yields following some recent economic data is making investors jumpy that interest rates won't come down as much or as quickly as thought. And that's doubly true for higher-multiple stocks related to the artificial intelligence buildout.\n\nOne Broadcom insider seems to agree that the company's stock has had a good run, with the company disclosing yesterday a key executive sold over $3 million in stock last week.\n\nEconomic data: Good news is bad news again?\n\nAll of these stocks are related to the AI buildout, and thus trade at elevated multiples. Arista makes the lightning-fast data center switches that enable the data flow needed for artificial intelligence training and inference, and Broadcom makes the key chipset that actually goes in Arista switches, in addition to its own AI custom accelerator business.\n\nRambus has actually not had a good year like the other two have, down about 8.8% for 2024 thus far. This is because the memory market is still broadly in a downturn at the moment. However, things are looking up for memory from this trough, and Rambus should eventually benefit from the AI buildout, which needs its memory interface solutions that help memory chips communicate with other parts of the computing structure.\n\nStill, each of these tech stocks trade at a somewhat higher valuation than a typical stock, and their multiples will be highly affected by rising interest rates. Today, the 10-year Treasury Bond yield rose to a high of 4.4%, which is a new high for 2024. The rise in yields came after a stronger-than-expected Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report this morning, which showed job openings increased slightly and that hiring picked up in February relative to January.\n\nWhy is that bad? Because it means the economy may still be running hotter than expected, which may mean inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target for longer than expected. That may keep the Federal Reserve from lowering the federal funds rate as soon as many expected in the first half of this year. All things equal, a higher inflationary and interest rate outlook will put pressure on stock valuations -- especially high-multiple growth stocks.\n\nBroadcom's director cashed in some chips\n\nAlso perhaps fueling today's gloom for Broadcom -- its chief legal officer, Mark David Brazeal, disclosed yesterday he sold nearly $3.3 million worth of Broadcom stock on March 28. While that was only around 5% of his holdings, it's still a large absolute number, and may indicate that Broadcom's strong recent run may hit the pause button.\n\nAll in all, today's declines in AI tech stocks don't seem to be a reason to worry, as a pullback is fairly normal for any stock or sector that has been on a strong run.\n\nMoreover, the slight uptick in hiring in February is not terrible news, as a strong economy is certainly better than the recession many were predicting a year ago. Of course, if inflation reaccelerates meaningfully, that would be bad. But for now, the news seems to indicate a mere pushing out of the timeline for inflation to get down to 2% and associated rate cuts, but doesn't seem like a reacceleration with the need to raise rates further... at least not yet.",
