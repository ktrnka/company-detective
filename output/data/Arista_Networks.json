This visibility allows administrators to see in real-time what devices are on the network. As the attack surface expands with more IoT devices and users connecting with their personal devices (BYOD), admins need to know as much as possible about the devices connected on the network.\n\nGeo-IP Filter\n\nGeo-IP Filter, also known as geo-blocking, allows administrators to filter traffic by country, and can block traffic to or from a geographic location. Specific countries can be allowed if needed. This security feature provides an additional layer of security and control for network administrators.\n\nDHCP Relay\n\nFor enterprises with many distributed networks, admins may prefer to centrally manage IP assignment via DHCP. In this scenario, each network must be capable of forwarding DHCP requests to a central server via VPN tunnels or dedicated links such as MPLS.\n\nPlease refer to the release notes for more information.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nMicro Edge version 4.3 is available as a free upgrade to customers with a paid subscription. Device Discoverability and Geo-IP Filter is included in the Micro Edge Security software package.\n\nVersion 4.2 Highlights\n\nIPsec VPN\n\nMicro Edge is a lightweight device that extends the network reach to the very edge, and now with IPsec VPN provides a wide variety of connectivity options. In addition to OpenVPN and WireGuard VPN connectivity options, IPsec VPN gives network administrators more flexibility when deploying Micro Edge appliances in their network. IPsec VPN uses the advanced WAN routing capabilities of Micro Edge, so you can leverage the tunnel for routing based on link performance and availability, applications, protocols, networks, and other criteria.\n\nOther updates include support for Japanese and German languages, OpenWrt operating system update, the ability to deploy in the European ETM Dashboard, and updated branding.\n\nPlease see the changelog for a full list of updates in Micro Edge 4.2.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nMicro Edge version 4.2 is available as a free upgrade to customers with a paid subscription.\n\nVersion 4.0 Highlights\n\nWeb Filter\n\nMicro Edge 4.0 (formerly SD-WAN Router) is a lightweight device that extends the network reach to the very perimeter. Micro Edge with Web Filter, provides additional security for networks that need it at branch offices. Web Filter, powered by Webroot BrightcloudⓇ, performs a real-time assessment of the site and blocks access to dangerous, inappropriate or distracting website content to protect the network and increase employee productivity. Web Filter, paired with Threat Prevention, provides multiple layers of security at the network edge.\n\nAdditional updates include performance improvements, nightly automatic configuration backups, and the ability to add static routes for local networks that reside behind other routers on the local network which helps admins who manage segmented networks at branch locations.\n\nPlease see the changelog for a full list of updates in Micro Edge 4.0.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nMicro Edge version 4.0 is available as a free upgrade to customers with a paid subscription.\n\nWeb Filter is included in the Micro Edge Security software package.\n\nVersion 3.1 Highlights\n\nThreat Prevention\n\nThreat Prevention brings a new layer of security to SD-WAN Router that blocks high risk Internet traffic using the Webroot BrightCloud® reputation score associated with the server hosting the service. The reputation score looks at a web page, web page associations and files to determine the likelihood that an IP address may be associated with spam, malware, spyware, web attacks, botnets and other cyber threats. Threat Prevention doesn’t rely on decrypting traffic from secure sites, so it is an efficient and effective tool to prevent cyber attacks even when the data is encrypted.\n\nNew Software Packages\n\nWith the introduction of Threat Prevention, we are now offering two software subscription packages. The entry level or Basic Package includes all of the features of SD-WAN Router to connect, optimize and provide continuity to all your locations. The Security Package adds a new level of security to your network with Threat Prevention. Both packages are available on all the eSeries hardware appliances offered by Untangle.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nSD-WAN Router Basic Package starts at $162/yr. USD, and SD-WAN Router Security Package starts at $260/yr. USD. View the online store for complete pricing and purchasing options.\n\nSD-WAN Router will automatically upgrade to new versions if Automatic Upgrades are turned on, which is the recommended setting. Otherwise, upgrades can be performed from Command Center or through the local web administration. See Upgrading your Untangle SD-WAN Router for more details.\n\nView the online store for complete pricing options.\n\nVersion 3.0 Highlights\n\nUntangle SD-WAN Router 3.0 includes the ability to use WireGuard® VPN which will enable administrators to connect remote locations to NG Firewall or other devices that support WireGuard VPN, via a secure and performant connection. Other updates include adding LTE support for AT&T, improved DHCP server management, ability to manage NIC media speed, and more.\n\nWireGuard VPN\n\nThis new VPN option is easy to implement and increases performance when connecting SD-WAN Router to a network. WireGuard uses state-of-the-art cryptography to secure user networks and delivers fast, performant connectivity, designed for ease-of-implementation and simplicity of configuration. Client-to-site network connectivity is simple to set up with an easy copy and paste between servers.\n\nAT&T LTE\n\nUntangle SD-WAN Router has achieved certification by AT&T to use the provider for LTE services. This improves the ability of SD-WAN Router to provide reliable internet connectivity to remote offices or branches that have unreliable or limited internet service. Users can select AT&T as the LTE provider on the SD-WAN Router e6wl appliance. Untangle SD-WAN Router is now certified to use any of the major carriers in the U.S. (AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon).\n\nPlease see the changelog for a full list of updates in SD-WAN Router 3.0.\n\n“WireGuard” and the “WireGuard” logo are registered trademarks of Jason A.

Threat Prevention scans IP addresses, blocking or granting access to web and application-based content after a complete analysis of the IP address reputation.\n\nIP address reputation scoring is based on the Webroot BrightCloud® IP Reputation Service ranking system. This intelligent, real-time packet inspection categorizes IP addresses into five distinct categories – High Risk, Suspicious, Moderate Risk, Low Risk, and Trustworthy. Just as a credit score, an IP Reputation score reviews web page associations, files, and any historical security issues the page may have had in the past as well as how clean it is today.\n\nLayered Security Solutions\n\nLayered Security Solutions are critical when creating a robust network security system. Implementing a multi-layered protection scheme can ensure that there are several checkpoints within the network to identify, check, and review content, complicating any opportunity a cybercriminal may take to infiltrate the network and access valuable data.\n\nThreat Prevention, layered with the advanced applications currently available on NG Firewall, such as Web Filter, and Virus Blocker, allow SMBs and organizations to protect against malicious activity.\n\nWeb Filter and Virus Blocker applications ensure that people can only get to web pages that are safe and secure. Adding Threat Prevention as a secondary layer reviews files, services and services accessed on the network. If any network packets do not meet the established safety criteria, they are blocked and rendered inaccessible on the corporate network.\n\nSMBs and organizations now have multiple battalions of protection working on their behalf to seek out and block malicious activity that might come from any entrance point. Any incoming threat will be stopped by one, two, or all of NG Firewall’s protective apps before it can reach the company network.",

      "# Post ID 1eyl31e: Cisco vs. Arista Maintenance & Renewals—Which is Better? with +9 score by [(Owlytica, Reddit, 2024-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/1eyl31e/cisco_vs_arista_maintenance_renewalswhich_is/)\nHey everyone, I’m curious about how Cisco’s maintenance and renewal processes compare to Arista’s. With Cisco, we have Smartnet for maintenance and warranties, but I’ve noticed some ongoing issues. For example, Cisco’s records can be inaccurate, leading to situations where they try to renew more maintenance than what the customer actually owns.\n\nAnother challenge is the disconnect between Cisco DNA licensing and the associated hardware, especially when a customer has an Enterprise Agreement (EA). When renewals come around, Cisco sometimes charges based on what’s been downloaded rather than what’s been consumed, which can be frustrating.\n\nI’m wondering if Arista has similar challenges, or if their maintenance and renewals process is more straightforward. Is Arista easier—or perhaps even harder—to manage from a maintenance and renewals perspective? Cisco has the Ready Report to export records, but it’s often outdated and inaccurate. Does Arista deal with these kinds of issues as well?\n\nWould love to hear your experiences\n\n## Comment ID ljdyg0e with +17 score by [(sryan2k1, Reddit, 2024-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/1eyl31e/cisco_vs_arista_maintenance_renewalswhich_is/ljdyg0e/) (in reply to ID 1eyl31e):\nArista has about 5 license levels that are all very clearly laid out about what features require what licenses.\n\n[https://www.arista.com/en/support/product-documentation/eos-feature-licensing/eos-platform-licensing](https://www.arista.com/en/support/product-documentation/eos-feature-licensing/eos-platform-licensing)\n\nNo licensing is mandatory (Base is included with the price of the device), there is no on box licensing (all honor based) Edit - Apparently MACSec is enforced, I assume due to legal/regulatory reasons though and not because they really wanted to. \n\n\n\nThe renewals are single line item SKUs priced per month with the quantity needed for each model/coverage type. (For example if you have two 7280R3's with 4 hour support and 10 720XPs with NBD you'd have a line item for 7280R3 - 4 Hour quantity 24 (2 units \\* 12 months) and another line item for 720XP NBD quantity 120, assuming you're buying in year chunks)\n\nYou tell me what you think is better.\n\n### Comment ID ljfgvv1 with +4 score by [(beskone, Reddit, 2024-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/1eyl31e/cisco_vs_arista_maintenance_renewalswhich_is/ljfgvv1/) (in reply to ID ljdyg0e):\nArista is pretty much Base or L3 Advanced + Support\n\nand even then L3 Advanced is honor system.

That is if you are on a budget then Arista might not be your first choice (on the other hand neither will Cisco, Juniper and a few others either).\n\n- Can be somewhat tricky to find out what is the most optimal model for your usecase since there are many variants of each model. Its not like back in the days where you had Cisco 29xx for L2-switching, 35xx for L3-switching and 65xx for chassibased L3 and thats it.

Some customers really want/need to have stacking (=one IP for a bunch of switches) mainly because monitoring like solarwinds is licensed per IP managed.\n\nshared control plane is the trade-off. \n\nHowever, I think this is completely different from the traditional stacking. This is more like a chassis (with redundant SM) build out of fixed switches. This makes updates/upgrades much easier. No need to reboot the complete stack (if any reboot needed).  \nIf you just want to manager them als one, no need for 1 IP, use LSS within CloudVision. no shared control plane\n\n### Comment ID m0okq59 with +1 score by [(SotongSG, Reddit, 2024-12-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arista/comments/1h604li/arista_unveils_modern_stacking_for_campus_networks/m0okq59/) (in reply to ID m0fbrif):\nSome customers reqlly really want Stacking no matter what.

One example of this is their approach to EIGRP, an amazing routing protocol that they kept closed off until the point where most rational people wouldn't consider it in their environment, even if they are using all Cisco products. This is because they realize they might one day want to use something other than Cisco.

Cisco supports both.\n\nFabricPath - same data plane structure as the standard TRILL, released before TRILL had a completed control plane standard (so the switching ASICs would be able to forward either in hardware). Unfortunately, TRILL was DOA due to the emergence and adoption of VXLAN.\n\nHSRP came out before VRRP, Cisco supports both.\n\nPAgP came out before LACP, Cisco supports both.\n\nBasically, Cisco has historically developed many capabilities now taken for granted to differentiate and offer features they saw the market needed, and **did not otherwise exist**. They then sat on or contributed to many standards working groups to develop open standards in conjunction with other vendors and industry contributors.\n\nAs a result, they support both. Original proprietary protocols because there may be some systems that still use those today and don’t want to migrate; and industry standard implementations for cross vendor compatibility.\n\nCisco is no angel. Arista is doing amazing things and I love their business model, they would be my primary choice in the data centre and would be a top vendor for evaluation in campus. But Cisco has developed a lot of the features that are standards today before they existed anywhere, then helped develop and define equivalent standards.\n\n#### Comment ID jqleez0 with +3 score by [(element9261, Reddit, 2023-07-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/144wdg5/arista_vs_cisco/jqleez0/) (in reply to ID jnifh6r):\nWhat a great post, love the history here.\n\n#### Comment ID jniky6h with +1 score by [(Golle, Reddit, 2023-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/144wdg5/arista_vs_cisco/jniky6h/) (in reply to ID jnifh6r):\nThanks for clarifying!\n\n### Comment ID jni0bh4 with +7 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/144wdg5/arista_vs_cisco/jni0bh4/) (in reply to ID jnhwvjf):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID jni26he with +3 score by [(Golle, Reddit, 2023-06-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/144wdg5/arista_vs_cisco/jni26he/) (in reply to ID jni0bh4):\nI wasn't denying that Cisco is also using Linux as its underlying OS. This is the reason IOS became IOS-XE, as the OS went from a monolithic architecture to process-based running on Linux.\n\nThe paragraph you qouted was specifically about being able to access the linux shell on a switch via \"bash\" or similar commands. This is an example of me running some commands in one of our arista switches:\n\n    dc01-le01a#show version \n    Arista DCS-7050CX3-32S-R\n\n    dc01-le01a#bash\n    [user@dc01-le01a ~]$ cat /etc/os-release \n    NAME=\"CentOS Linux\"\n\n    [user@dc01-le01a ~]$ python3\n    >>> print(\"hello reddit\")\n    hello reddit\n\nI'm not aware of Cisco being able to do anything similar to this.

The only gripe I will say is that when you open a VPN ticket, you get a VPN ninja who doesn't know how anything else works.

You will never afford a house that you can call home that is within a reasonable commute distance to work, forget about it! They're wasting billions building a new HQ so they can enforce a full RTO instead of paying employees decent wages.\n\nZERO benefits working at Arista over ANY other company in the SV area. They don't even have a company cafeteria to avoid paying for a $20 lunch. There goes $2k of your already meager salary down the drain! On paper we have \"Unlimited PTO\" but your coworkers and managers make it very clear not to take more than 4 weeks or there will be consequences in your next performance review.\n\nPurposefully opaque swe levels so that the company can underpay everyone! The only purpose of having your coworkers review you is so that this company can advertise this as a benefit to fool you into working for a very low compensation level while the execs run out the back with all the money! \n\nSpeaking of execs, don't be fooled by Kenneth Duda's high and mighty speeches about good software; remember that you will be paid pennies to write that good software for him while he sits in his giant study of his mansion and preaches about it to you on a regular basis.\n\nThere is no such thing as company pride here. All of the company events are cheap and nobody even shows up to them. There are 2 types of employees at arista: the recent ones stuck here like me and the decade long employees getting at least 20x my salary thanks to stock appreciation since they joined. The only reason why anyone from the last few years is here is because they couldn't get into company X Y or Z that they actually wanted to get into. I have yet to meet anyone young at this company that is \"proud\" to work here or genuinely wanted to work here.\n\nOverall, I would only work here as a last resort to keep from starving on the streets. Always spend the extra time you have from working less than 8 hours on finding a better company because you will not have enough money to do any interesting hobby to make your life fulfilling.",

You will never afford a house that you can call home that is within a reasonable commute distance to work, forget about it!

They don't even have a company cafeteria to avoid paying for a $20 lunch. There goes $2k of your already meager salary down the drain! On paper we have \"Unlimited PTO\" but your coworkers and managers make it very clear not to take more than 4 weeks or there will be consequences in your next performance review.\n\nPurposefully opaque swe levels so that the company can underpay everyone! The only purpose of having your coworkers review you is so that this company can advertise this as a benefit to fool you into working for a very low compensation level while the execs run out the back with all the money! \n\nSpeaking of execs, don't be fooled by Kenneth Duda's high and mighty speeches about good software; remember that you will be paid pennies to write that good software for him while he sits in his giant study of his mansion and preaches about it to you on a regular basis.\n\nThere is no such thing as company pride here. All of the company events are cheap and nobody even shows up to them. There are 2 types of employees at arista: the recent ones stuck here like me and the decade long employees getting at least 20x my salary thanks to stock appreciation since they joined. The only reason why anyone from the last few years is here is because they couldn't get into company X Y or Z that they actually wanted to get into. I have yet to meet anyone young at this company that is \"proud\" to work here or genuinely wanted to work here.\n\nOverall, I would only work here as a last resort to keep from starving on the streets.

      "# [Arista Networks, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2024 Financial Results by Arista Networks, Whitney Sisler on 2024-05-07](https://www.arista.com/en/company/news/press-release/19453-pr-20240507)\nBoard of Directors Authorizes Additional $1.2B Stock Repurchase Program\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif.- May 7, 2024 -- Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE: ANET), an industry leader in data-driven, client to cloud networking for large data center/AI, campus and routing environments, today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nFirst Quarter Financial Highlights\n\n“Arista is off to a strong start to 2024 with solid first quarter results,” said Jayshree Ullal, Chairperson and CEO of Arista Networks. “As we get ready to celebrate the 10th anniversary of our IPO in June, I am pleased with our progress in the Arista 2.0 journey as seen in breakthrough innovations, customer traction and building our next generation leaders.”\n\nRevenue of $1.571 billion, an increase of 2.0% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, and an increase of 16.3% from the first quarter of 2023.\n\nGAAP gross margin of 63.7%, compared to GAAP gross margin of 64.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 59.5% in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin of 64.2%, compared to non-GAAP gross margin of 65.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 60.3% in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nGAAP net income of $637.7 million, or $1.99 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $436.5 million, or $1.38 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net income of $637.7 million, or $1.99 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $452.5 million, or $1.43 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nCommenting on the company's financial results, Chantelle Breithaupt, Arista’s CFO said, \"We are pleased with our performance this quarter, which exceeded expectations across key financial metrics. Our commitment remains to deliver long-term value to our shareholders through sustained financial performance and strategic investments.\"\n\nStock Repurchase Programs\n\nArista has now completed repurchases of its common stock totaling $2 billion under previous stock repurchase programs. On May 3, 2024, Arista’s Board of Directors authorized an additional program to repurchase up to $1.2 billion. The actual timing and amount of repurchases will be dependent on market and business conditions, capital requirements, stock price, acquisition opportunities and other factors.\n\nCompany Highlights\n\nArista Introduces Universal Network Observability – Arista announces CloudVisionⓇ Universal Network ObservabilityTM (CV UNOTM), a modern network observability software offering merging network infrastructure performance and data from compute and server systems-of-record to deliver keen insights into application and workload performance across data center, campus, and wide area networks.\n\nThe New AI Era: Networking for AI and AI for Networking – Arista is delivering both optimal Networking for AI platforms and AI for networking outcomes. AI Etherlink platforms deliver high performance, low latency, fully scheduled, lossless networking as the new unit of currency for AI networks. At the same time AI for networking drives positive outcomes such as security, root cause analysis and observability through AVA.\n\nFinancial Outlook\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, we expect:\n\nRevenue between $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion\n\nNon-GAAP gross margin of approximately 64%; and\n\nNon-GAAP operating margin of approximately 44%.\n\nGuidance for non-GAAP financial measures excludes stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and potential non-recurring charges or benefits. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis because these exclusions can be uncertain or difficult to predict, including stock-based compensation expense which is impacted by the company’s future hiring and retention needs and the future fair market value of the company’s common stock. The actual amount of these exclusions will have a significant impact on the company’s GAAP gross margin and GAAP operating margin.\n\nPrepared Materials and Conference Call Information\n\nArista's executives will discuss the first quarter 2024 financial results on a conference call at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time today. To listen to the call via telephone, dial (888) 330-2502 in the United States or +1 (240) 789-2713 from international locations.

Shortly after the conclusion of the conference call, a replay of the audio webcast will be available on Arista’s investor relations website.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” regarding our future performance, including quotations from management, statements in the section entitled “Financial Outlook,” such as estimates regarding revenue, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter of 2024 and statements regarding the benefits of Arista's products. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated in or implied by the forward-looking statements including risks associated with: large purchases by a limited number of customers who represent a substantial portion of our revenue; adverse economic and geopolitical conditions and conflicts, including inflationary pressures which result in increased component costs and reduced information technology and network infrastructure spending, the Russia/Ukraine, Israel/Hamas conflicts and the Houthi attacks on marine vessels in the Red Sea; changes in our customers technology roadmaps and priorities including the need for the deployment of artificial intelligence (“AI”) and related technologies; the impact of sole or limited sources of supply, supply shortages and extended lead times or supply changes; volatility in our revenue growth rate; variations in our results of operations; the rapid evolution of the networking market; failure to successfully carry out new products and service offerings and expand into adjacent markets; variability in our gross margins; intense competition and industry consolidation; expansion of our international sales and operations; investments in or acquisitions of other businesses; seasonality and industry cyclicality; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; failure to raise additional capital on favorable terms; our inability to attract new large customers or sell additional products and services to our existing customers; sales of our switches generating most of our product revenue; large customers requiring more favorable terms; inability to increase market awareness or acceptance of our new products and services; decreases in the sales prices of our products and services; long and unpredictable sales cycles; declines in maintenance renewals by customers; product quality problems; failure to anticipate technological shifts; managing the supply of our products and product components; our dependence on third-party manufacturers to build our products; assertions by third parties of intellectual property rights infringement; failure to protect or assert our intellectual property rights; defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our products, the failure of our products to detect security breaches or incidents, the misuse of our products or the risks or product liability; enhanced U.S. tax, tariff, import/export restrictions, Chinese regulations or other trade barriers; failure to comply with government law and regulations; issues in the development and use of artificial intelligence, combined with an uncertain regulatory environment; and other future events. Additional risks and uncertainties that could affect us can be found in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. You can locate these reports through our website at https://investors.arista.com/ and on the SEC’s website at https://www.sec.gov/. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to the company as of the date hereof and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release and accompanying table contain certain non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, gains/losses on strategic investments, and the income tax effect of these non-GAAP exclusions. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures exclude net tax benefits associated with stock-based awards, which include excess tax benefits, and other discrete indirect effects of such awards. The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends. In addition, these measures are the primary indicators management uses as a basis for its planning and forecasting for future periods.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to limitations, and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. A description of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.\n\nAbout Arista Networks\n\nArista Networks is an industry leader in data-driven, client to cloud networking for large data center/AI, campus and routing environments.

This critical infrastructure supports communication service providers and community anchor institutions in bridging the digital divide.\n\nAs part of the over $340 million investment, AFN selected Arista's high-performance 7280SR3 platform, Ciena’s WaveLogic 5 Nano (WL5n) 400G ZR+ pluggable transceivers and Reconfigurable Line System (RLS).\n\n“Through AFN's middle-mile network, last-mile providers will have the bandwidth they need to bring high-speed broadband to rural Alabamians. This network will not only boost economic development but also improve access to healthcare and education,” said Terry Metze, AFN’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are building a best-in-class network that offers the highest levels of performance and security. Arista's technology is the perfect choice to help AFN achieve these standards.\"\n\n“The Alabama Fiber Network represents a significant step towards enhanced connectivity and digital inclusion across the region,” said Ashwin Kohli, Chief Customer Officer for Arista Networks. “Both AFN and Arista are driven by a shared purpose of leveraging technology to create positive change. We are honored to be a part of this transformative initiative.”\n\nThe Arista 7280R3 routing platforms offer a scalable and adaptable architecture, enabling seamless connectivity across diverse locations. They provide robust automation, routing, and switching capabilities to handle the demands of the extensive network. Additionally, AFN will leverage Arista's CloudVision® platform for streamlined network management, Arista Professional Services for implementation and validation, and enterprise solutions to support customer acquisition.\n\nArista and Ciena have jointly certified the Ciena WL5n QSFP-DD coherent pluggable transceivers solution. With this solution, Alabama Fiber Networks optimizes cost and power efficiency for transporting broadband traffic statewide at high bandwidth 400Gb/s rates, even across distances of 1,000km.

      "# [Why Arista Networks Stock Soared Today by Keith Noonan, www.facebook.com on 2025-01-22](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/01/22/why-arista-networks-stock-soared-today/)\nArista Networks (ANET -4.93%) stock surged in Wednesday's trading. The networking hardware company's share price ended the daily session up 6.8% and had been up as much as 8% earlier in trading. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index closed out the day up 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite index ended the session up 1.2%.\n\nAt the White House yesterday, leaders from OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank announced they had formed a new joint company that will invest up to $500 billion in U.S. artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. As a provider of hardware including switches and routers, Arista could wind up landing sales through the new investment project.\n\nArista Networks stock pops on big AI infrastructure news\n\nOpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank have come together to form Stargate -- a joint venture aimed at strengthening domestic AI infrastructure. At Stargate's announcement event yesterday, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison said that the company's first data center is already being constructed in Texas and will span one-million square feet upon completion.\n\nThe three partners are pouring a $100 billion initial investment into Stargate and could ramp their investment up to $500 billion in subsequent years. The move is a bullish development for AI processing and networking companies, and Arista Networks was among the names to get a valuation boost today thanks to the news.\n\nWhat comes next for Arista Networks?\n\nArista Networks looks poised to see long-term tailwinds related to AI data center spending. On the other hand, some strong future growth is already priced into the stock. With the company valued at roughly $163.5 billion, Arista is trading at 52.6 times this year's expected earnings.",

      "# [Arista Networks former chairman agrees to pay nearly $1M to settle insider trading charges on 2024-03-26](https://apnews.com/article/arista-networks-insider-trading-sec-0e85c38b85ebb12287ef0320db34d0b1)\nThe founder and former chairman of technology company Arista Networks has agreed to pay almost $1 million to settle insider trading charges.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday that Andreas “Andy” Bechtolsheim misappropriated material nonpublic information related to the impending acquisition of Acacia Communications of Maynard, Massachusetts.\n\nThe SEC alleged that Bechtolsheim, who was Arista’s chair at the time, learned of Acacia’s potential acquisition on July 8, 2019, through his and Arista’s longstanding relationship with another technology company which was also considering buying Acacia and which consulted with Bechtolsheim concerning the potential takeover.\n\nImmediately after learning this information, the SEC said that Bechtolsheim allegedly traded Acacia options in the accounts of a close relative and an associate. The next day, July 9, 2019, before the market opened, Acacia and Cisco announced that Cisco had agreed to acquire Acacia for $70 per share. That day, Acacia’s stock price increased by 35.1%. The SEC’s complaint states that Bechtolsheim’s trading generated combined illegal profits of $415,726 in the accounts of his relative and associate.\n\nCisco’s $4.5 billion purchase of Acacia ultimately closed nearly two years later in March 2021.\n\nBechtolsheim, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC’s complaint, settled the charges by agreeing to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to pay a civil monetary penalty of $923,740.\n\nThe settlement is subject to court approval.",

Although fit for purpose at the time, with increased use of video, interactive content, and simulation - plus an increased student body - the data centre was starting to experience hardware and software issues along with occasional small outages.\n\n“Arista's advanced services really set the bar for how a customer-vendor relationship should appear.”\n\nServing entities such as fire departments, police departments, municipalities, and educational institutes, CEN is relied upon by their customers to provide critical services. CEN looked to Arista to provide high-speed aggregation and Internet service delivery for their network, all with real-time state streaming telemetry and next-gen provisioning through CloudVision®.\n\n“We have real-time visibility of everything that is happening in the network and we are able to change configurations on the spot”\n\nIE University was able to install and test an extensive and complex network, spanning 32 floors and delivering Wi-Fi to 7,000 students and staff, working within an incredibly short deadline of six weeks, before the building opened to students and staff. As part of the process, the university performed a number of proof-of- concept tests which included stress testing the system under high loads.\n\nCognitive Campus Workspaces\n\nArista’s Cognitive campus as a service is based on a data-driven architecture that offers consistent, unified management across the campus edge for wired and wireless networks, as well as integrated security & proactive network assurance. You can visit our solution page for a better understanding of our key benefits for Campus Workspaces\n\nGo to the solution page\n\nZero Trust Networking\n\nArista’s Zero Trust portfolio eliminates the need for several network monitoring and security tools by delivering a unified architecture that provides real-time visibility to the threat posture across the network, and the ability to take action. Arista is uniquely positioned to deliver these capabilities across a variety of networks: from the campus to the data center and the cloud.\n\nGo to the solution page\n\n“Interface profiles that can apply the same settings to multiple ports, and other such user-friendly features, reduce the tediousness of daily operation and management.”\n\nIn April 2023, OIST fully adopted Arista’s solutions to configure the network used to launch operations of its Lab 5 research facility.

These non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization, expenses related to legal settlement, gains/losses on strategic investments, and the income tax effect of these non-GAAP exclusions.

Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to limitations, and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. A description of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.\n\nAbout Arista Networks\n\nArista Networks is an industry leader in data-driven, client-to-cloud networking for large AI, data center, campus and routing environments.
