However, you also need to be mindful of the rights of the people whose data you collect, especially their personally identifiable information (PII). In fact, if your business stores, processes, and shares consumer data, PII compliance is a legal requirement under numerous laws.",

I dropped the game after max lvl because I think I got overwhelmed and lost about what do to next. \n\nAfter Steam release, the game came to my radar once again and I decided to give another try and I'm having so much more fun now. I leveled another character (this time a Necromancer!!!) and now I'm facing the same walls again, but I'm not intending to give up like before. Since I'm not in a guild yet i'm relying on watching videos and read guides.\n\nBut one thing I'm really confused is about HP in expansion areas. I really want to unlock the Reaper but need a lot more HP to do so. I read the expansion areas gives u 10 points per challenge but they aren't soloable. Then I discovered about the HP trains that happens often on LFG. \n\nToday I saw one train on LFG but I was scared to join thinking this could be only for vets and their alts. So I'm here to ask for the next time I see one in LFG.\n\nThose trains usually accept new players or have any reqs besides Raptor and Gliding (I have both)? I need to have all waypoints in HoT unlocked before joining one in order to not be a burden and delay the others? Need to complete all the story there in advance? \n\nThanks and sorry for my bad english (it's not my first language).\n\nEDIT: After reading y'all comments here I got the courage to join into Aixxel The Defender train and got all HoT HPs. He was nice and patient for over 2 hours and this prob was one of the best experiences I've had in a MMO for a long time. Everyone running, dying and chatting was really fun. Thank you ALL!\n\n## Comment ID in3ixi8 with +86 score by [(graven2002, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/x5wfo4/about_hp_trains/in3ixi8/) (in reply to ID x5wfo4):\nHP trains are usually *very* casual/new player friendly.  Glider and Raptor are helpful, and some WPs, but the Squad Commander will let you know their expectations.\n\nThat said, only HoT HPs are really tuned for groups.

Though now that raptors are given they expect players to at least use that to keep up. \n\nI rarely see other trains being mentioned but that's because PoF and EoD HP are a joke compared to HoT HP.\n\n### Comment ID in59197 with +7 score by [(typhlownage, Reddit, 2022-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/x5wfo4/about_hp_trains/in59197/) (in reply to ID in3ixi8):\nWhen I've seen HP trains, they've always required basic gliding (or skimmer might work, I guess).

You can tag the wp closest to the HP and someone will be there.

A train that says \"only raptor/glider needed\" is a slow train where the conductor is going to make an effort to ensure everyone gets each HP via portals/other help. A \"Fast\" train assumes you have the mounts/masteries to keep up and general knowledge (eg you've done this several times, its just another alt) and from a POF perspective, a slow train is ~2h and a fast is ~45m.   \n  \nDoesn't hurt to say you're new and the train conductor will probably tell you whether it's a train you'll be able to keep up with.

Some may require \"base raptor and glider\" or some of the HP nodes will require a mastery to access.\n\nA good commander will call these out so you can hang back and not die due to environmental effects you can't bypass yet, but just ask what the base requirements are for the train and they can tell you if they didn't advertise what it was!\n\nI will say one downside to doing an HP Train is that when you're done and you max out your shiny new spec, you didn't do so gradually, so, you got a lot of new stuff to learn at once and consider.

They will assume you have awareness however; so pay attention and don't get distracted clicking on nodes or you will fall behind. Osano aka Squad For HP Train (done up to look like Saitama from One Punch Man) calls when he's going to put down Portals for people and most of the time when I see newbies get lost it's because they ignored him indicating he was going to do that, attempted to follow on the route that needed a mastery/mount they didn't have, and then not figure out how to get back to where the portal is.\n\n## Comment ID in4ltc1 with +1 score by [(rzalexander, Reddit, 2022-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/x5wfo4/about_hp_trains/in4ltc1/) (in reply to ID x5wfo4):\nMost HP trains (with few exceptions) should be welcoming for new players.

Most hero points actually are soloable by a good chunk of the player base, but some are definitely hard enough you couldnt be faulted for not being able to do it. But it is within reason that once you're comfortable and more experienced (and properly geared) you could solo pretty much all HPs. Especially as this is your first elite spec. Remember after you've unlocked reaper, you can use it to do HPs in PoF or EoD if you later want to unlock harbinger or scourge. Not like you have to go back to core necro to do that.\n\nHP train squads usually have a squad message once you join that will give some details about when it starts, what is required,etc. Most HP trains are super casual (and thus very slow) but some are faster. But read the message,and leave if it doesn't match what you can do. For pretty much any open world content it's OK to ask questions. Maybe for stuff like raids yeah don't join a squad you don't know and randomly ask them what it is and what they're doing (tho tbh I feel like lots of parties would let you down politely)but for open world squads, give'er.\n\n## Comment ID in5ddtj with +1 score by [(Davosz_, Reddit, 2022-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/x5wfo4/about_hp_trains/in5ddtj/) (in reply to ID x5wfo4):\nThe people who run them will list what is required.

If you miss one, no stress, just move along to catch up with the group via the commanders tag.\n\nThe experience is very newbie friendly though.\n\nNote on glider and raptor. These are obtained at the start of the Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire xpacs respectively.

Was wondering if someone has experiences with the tools that help for GDPR compliance (OneTrust, ...). It seems to me (maybe I'm wrong) these tools are a bit overkilled for startups.\n\nIf I'm right, do the startups use any tool to facilitate their compliance effort (GDPR or any other regulation) ?\n\n## Comment ID lhndg8e with +1 score by [(Safe-Contribution909, Reddit, 2024-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gdpr/comments/1epur94/compliance_tool_for_startups/lhndg8e/) (in reply to ID 1epur94):\nI don‚Äôt know about this group, but there‚Äôs loads on the facebook gdpr group\n\n## Comment ID lhnh5l2 with +1 score by [(Noscituur, Reddit, 2024-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gdpr/comments/1epur94/compliance_tool_for_startups/lhnh5l2/) (in reply to ID 1epur94):\nDepends on the complexity of the processing activities the business is carrying out.

I've never used their GDPR compliance tools, so I don't know how well they work.\n\nI was at a conference last year and Privado seems to have a pretty good story when it comes to compliance and software development (seems to be their speciality).\n\n## Comment ID lhnkoe4 with +1 score by [(Born-Paleontologist9, Reddit, 2024-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gdpr/comments/1epur94/compliance_tool_for_startups/lhnkoe4/) (in reply to ID 1epur94):\nIf the compliance dept doesnt have a funding.

I'm a co-founder at VAYU, an end-to-end AI-enabled automated compliance platform that uses AI agents with designated roles to automate and scale compliance for frameworks like SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR, ISO, etc. My co-founders are cyber experts and full-stack ML engineers who've been through YC and experienced the time-consuming SOC2 & GDPR process. Our agents handle everything from defining & implement controls, automatically gathering evidence, and liaising with the auditors back and forth so you and your team doesn't need to (we have a large audit-network who we've negotiated price cuts with since we are also providing them with a touchless process). This saves you a lot of time, since we essentially offer you an entire AI security team to handle compliance. We'd love to hop on an initial call with you to educate you on what compliance frameworks your start-up even needs, the intricacies involved, and answer any questions you may have.

He was born a siren to a siren family, and he always struggled with breathing water. Once he transitioned into being a human, he swore off the ocean, and ended up having vividly realistic nightmares of drowning, to the point where he avoids water at all costs. To the point where he struggles to shower, go to the bathroom, or even drink water without his intrusive thoughts freaking him out.\n\nKit's fear stems from before he could remember. He was a bastard son, and he was forced to live with his mom's husband after the divorce. Turns out, this kind of pushed his dad over the edge, so when Kit was only one, his dad tried to bury him alive. Thankfully, he was stopped by neighbors who heard Kit screaming, but this didn't stop Kit from having (you guessed it) nightmares about the incident.\n\nSkye used to be a part of an organized crime ring. Her dad's favorite party trick was to throw alcohol at people who swindled him, then light them on fire. Turns out, seeing someone cook from the outside takes a toll on some people. In fact, Skye used to be an alcoholic, but she quit after stumbling across a video of someone getting drunk, trying to light their breath on fire, and accidentally catching fire themselves.\n\nOwen literally died of hypothermia, so as a spirit, he has frigophobia.\n\n## Comment ID jhdhtui with +3 score by [(broken-lycan, Reddit, 2023-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/picrew/comments/12vzm2b/my_ocs_as_their_biggest_fears_i_find_the_ideas_of/jhdhtui/) (in reply to ID 12vzm2b):\nooooh this is really interesting!!\n\n## Comment ID jhe8ipl with +2 score by [(ReaperofLightning872, Reddit, 2023-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/picrew/comments/12vzm2b/my_ocs_as_their_biggest_fears_i_find_the_ideas_of/jhe8ipl/) (in reply to ID 12vzm2b):\nscary things are cool\n\n## Comment ID jhd8q5d with +1 score by [(AutoModerator, Reddit, 2023-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/picrew/comments/12vzm2b/my_ocs_as_their_biggest_fears_i_find_the_ideas_of/jhd8q5d/) (in reply to ID 12vzm2b):\nHi!

He is really passionate and it shows!\n\nI'd definitely recommend getting a day pass and making sure the place is a good fit as well. I am not the strongest guy around, but I've been a ton of gyms around here.  \n\nIron Religion/Power Strength and TFX are excellent gyms for bodybuilders and those focused on bodybuilding - you can definitely get strong at those gyms as well, but I'd put them more in the bodybuilding realm.\n\nThe Gym Downtown, Greed Island, and Orlando Barbell are all the powerlifting gyms.  Greed Island is awesome, but way too far, especially if the Gym Downtown is 8 minutes from you.  Orlando Barbell is old school and definitely has the credentials, but it definitely caters to an old school mentality overall.  The Gym Downtown, to me, caters to the new school of powerlifters.\n\nSpecial shoutout to the Weight House as well, i haven't been to their new spot, but they are also a good place to check out, and they are the home gym of the Osano training group, which are some of the nicest guys around.  One of their head coaches also trains at Gym Downtown.

It's about the mindset and approach of the leaders. I've never felt so empowered yet supported by everyone from my manager to my direct team members. The culture is very curious, not judgemental. This leads to really open discussions with diverse perspectives that result in great ideas and actionable plans. \n\nThe culture is also very family-first. Go to your son's fall festival, take time to see your parents, take a few days to help your sister move, step away to go pick up your kids. We all do it. \n\nOther pros include: \n- The company is on fire. It's in a rapidly growing space and we have the best product by far.\n- You get to work alongside people are who REALLY good at what they do. Sure, we're all still growing our crafts, but man have we hired some experts. \n- Everything is really well organized. From onboarding to IT requests, it's so well automated. \n- Transparent company OKRs help the company stay focused and aligned \n- Swag quality is top notch :)",

This leads to really open discussions with diverse perspectives that result in great ideas and actionable plans. \n\nThe culture is also very family-first. Go to your son's fall festival, take time to see your parents, take a few days to help your sister move, step away to go pick up your kids. We all do it. \n\nOther pros include: \n- The company is on fire. It's in a rapidly growing space and we have the best product by far.\n- You get to work alongside people are who REALLY good at what they do. Sure, we're all still growing our crafts, but man have we hired some experts. \n- Everything is really well organized. From onboarding to IT requests, it's so well automated. \n- Transparent company OKRs help the company stay focused and aligned \n- Swag quality is top notch :)",

      "# [Data Privacy Laws: What You Need to Know in 2025 by Osano Staff on 2024-08-12](https://www.osano.com/articles/data-privacy-laws)\nVirtually every country has enacted some sort of data privacy law to regulate how information is collected, how data subjects are informed, and what control a data subject has over their information once it is transferred. Failure to follow applicable data privacy laws may lead to fines, lawsuits, and even prohibiting a site's use in certain jurisdictions. Navigating these laws and regulations can be daunting, but all website operators should be familiar with data privacy laws that affect their users.\n\nNew and Upcoming Data Privacy Laws in 2025\n\nIt's important to remain cognizant of existing data privacy laws, but perhaps you just want to review what's new in 2025 and beyond.\n\nU.S. Data Privacy Laws\n\nDespite numerous proposals over the years, no one comprehensive federal law governs data privacy in the U.S. yet. In the meantime, individual states have acted rather than wait on the federal government. There's a complex patchwork of sector-specific and medium-specific laws, including laws and regulations that address telecommunications, health information, credit information, financial institutions, and marketing.\n\nThe FTC\n\nAn important enforcement agency in the U.S. is the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Its authority to regulate on behalf of consumer protections comes from The Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), which has broad jurisdiction over commercial entities under its authority to prevent unfair or \"deceptive trade practices.\"\n\nWhile the FTC uses its authority to issue regulations, enforce privacy laws, and take enforcement actions to protect consumers. For example, the FTC might take impose action against organizations that:\n\nFail to implement and maintain reasonable data security measures\n\nFail to abide by any applicable self-regulatory principles of the organization's industry\n\nFail to follow a published privacy policy\n\nTransfer personal information in a manner not disclosed in the privacy policy\n\nMake inaccurate privacy and security representations (i.e., lying) to consumers and in privacy policies\n\nFail to provide sufficient security for personal data\n\nViolate consumer data privacy rights by collecting, processing, or sharing consumer information\n\nEngage in misleading advertising practices\n\nOther federal laws that govern the collection of information online include:\n\nThe Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which governs the collection of information about minors\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act (HIPAA), which governs the collection of health information\n\nThe Gramm Leach Bliley Act (GLBA), which governs personal information collected by banks and financial institutions\n\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which regulates the collection and use of credit information\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which protects the privacy of student education records\n\nState Privacy Laws\n\nThe U.S. also has hundreds of sectoral data privacy and data security laws among its states. State attorneys general oversee data privacy laws governing the collection, storage, safeguarding, disposal, and use of personal data collected from their residents, especially regarding data breach notifications and the security of Social Security numbers. Some apply only to governmental entities, others to private entities, and others apply to both.\n\nIn addition to sectoral privacy laws, the U.S. is experiencing a massive drive toward pushing privacy legislation at the state level. That‚Äôs because the federal government hasn‚Äôt been able to find a consensus on how to legislate broadly. Rather than wait, state lawmakers have been nudged by consumers, consumer advocates, and even companies to set their own rules.\n\nOf course, companies would rather comply with a single federal standard than hire attorneys and privacy professionals, invest in compliance tools, and establish a robust compliance program that covers all applicable state laws. But states see the lack of any data privacy protections as more damaging than overly complex data privacy protections.\n\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)\n\nThe most comprehensive state data privacy legislation to date is the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). The CPRA was passed by a ballot initiative in November 2020 and amended California‚Äôs previous state privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). It went into effect on January 1, 2023.\n\nThe CPRA is cross-sector legislation that introduces important definitions and broad individual consumer rights and imposes substantial duties on entities or persons that collect personal information about or from a California resident. These duties include informing data subjects when and how data is collected; allowing them to opt-out of data collection; allowing them to access, correct, and delete such information; and restricting how businesses can transfer personal information to other entities.\n\nMany of the above requirements were also included in the CCPA, but once the CPRA passed, the law was amended to include the following:\n\nRight to rectification: This updates and adds to a consumer‚Äôs right to correct inaccurate personal information.\n\nRight to restriction: This grants consumers the right to limit the use and disclosure of their sensitive personal information.\n\nSensitive personal information: This updates the definition of personal information. Certain types of information, like a consumer‚Äôs Social Security number, must be treated with special protections.\n\nThe CPRA also:\n\nIncreased fines for breaches of children‚Äôs data threefold\n\nExpanded breach liability beyond breaches of unencrypted data to disclosures of credentials (like an email address or password) that could lead to access to a consumer‚Äôs account\n\nLimited the duration of time a company may retain a consumer‚Äôs information to only what‚Äôs necessary and ‚Äúproportionate‚Äù to the reason it was collected in the first place\n\nRequires companies working with third parties, contractors, and outside service providers to contractually mandate that those organizations exercise the same level of privacy protection to data shared with them as the first party\n\nOne of the most significant features of the CPRA is its enforcement. While state attorneys general typically handle privacy cases‚Äîunless the FTC is involved, and even then, it‚Äôs often a partnership‚Äîthe CPRA establishes a new privacy regulator.\n\nThe California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) can fine transgressors, hold hearings about privacy violations, and clarify privacy guidelines. It‚Äôs a five-member board, and it starts enforcing six months after the CPRA goes into effect on July 1, 2023.\n\nVirginia's Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA)\n\nVirginia's Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA) was passed on March 2, 2021. It grants Virginia consumers certain rights over their data and requires companies covered by the law to comply with rules on the data they collect, how it's treated and protected, and with whom it's shared.\n\nThe law contains some similarities to the EU General Data Protection Regulation's (GDPR) provisions and the CPRA. It applies to entities that do business in Virginia or sell products and services targeted to Virginia residents and also meet one of the following:\n\nControl or process the personal data of 100,000 or more\n\nControl or process the personal data of at least 25,000 consumers and earn 50% of their revenue by selling personal information\n\nThe CDPA requires companies covered by the law to assist consumers in exercising their data rights by obtaining opt-in consent before processing their sensitive data (non-sensitive data may be collected so long as the consumer is notified), disclosing when their data will be sold, and allowing them to opt-out of data collection. It also requires companies to provide users with a clear privacy notice that enables consumers to opt-out of targeted advertising. In addition, it requires data brokers to honor consumers‚Äô requests to opt out of data processing, among other requirements.\n\nThe CDPA went into effect on January 1, 2023.\n\nColorado Privacy Act (CPA)\n\nIn June 2020, Colorado became the third U.S. state to pass a privacy law. The Colorado Privacy Act grants Colorado residents rights over their data and places obligations on data controllers and processors. It contains some similarities to California's CPRA, Virginia's CDPA, and the EU‚Äôs GDPR.\n\nWhile there are similarities, such as some form of a right to opt-out, special protections for sensitive data, and the adoption of some privacy-by-design principles, the significant differences are in the details.\n\nThe CPA applies to businesses that collect personal data from 100,000 Colorado residents or collect data from 25,000 Colorado residents and derive revenue from the sale of that data.\n\nThe law lists five rights granted to Colorado residents once the law becomes effective on July 1, 2023. They are:\n\nThe right to opt-out of targeted ads, the sale of their personal data, or being profiled\n\nThe right to access the data a company has collected about them\n\nThe right to correct data that's been collected about them\n\nThe right to request the data collected about them is deleted\n\nThe right to data portability (that is, the right to take your data and move it to another company)\n\nThere are 17 blanket exemptions within the law. Data exemptions include:\n\nIf the data was collected for Colorado health insurance law purposes\n\nIf the entity collecting the data or the data collected is already covered by certain sectoral laws, including COPPA or the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\n\nIf the data has been de-identified or pseudonymized\n\nIf the data is being maintained and used by a consumer reporting agency\n\nIf the data is being used for employment records purposes\n\nSince the law goes into effect midway through 2023, businesses should expect updates to the law via rulemaking in the first half of the year.\n\nUtah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA)\n\nIn March 2022, Utah became the fourth state to enact a comprehensive consumer privacy law, which will take effect on December 31, 2023. The Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA) draws from the CDPA, CPA, and CPRA.\n\nThe law applies to both data controllers and processors that generate over $25 million in annual revenue and either:\n\nControl or process personal data for over 100,000 consumers yearly, or\n\nDerive over 50% of the entity‚Äôs gross revenue from the sale of personal data and controls or processes the personal data of 25,000 or more consumers.\n\nSimilarly to the statutes in Colorado and Virginia, there are exemptions for certain types of personal data; however, they‚Äôre broader at both the entity and data levels.\n\nThe law does not apply to governmental entities or third parties acting on behalf of a governmental entity, tribes, institutions of higher education, nonprofit corporations, business associates, information that meets the definition of protected health information for HIPAA and related regulations, and more.\n\nFinancial institutions governed by the GLBA (the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) and information in the FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act) also aren‚Äôt subject to the UCPA. Data processed or maintained in the course of employment is also exempt.\n\nConsumers have the right to:\n\nConfirm whether a controller is processing their personal data and accessing or deleting personal data provided\n\nObtain a copy of their personal data in a portable, accessible format\n\nOpt-out of processing of personal data for targeted advertising or sale\n\nIn contrast to the CDPA and CPA, the UCPA does not include the right to opt-out of profiling nor codify the right to correct inaccuracies in their data.\n\nConnecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA)\n\nConnecticut's fifth and most recent state to adopt a comprehensive consumer privacy law. Senate Bill 6, or ‚ÄúAn Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring‚Äù (CTDPA), went into effect July 1, 2023.\n\nThe law also draws from Virginia and Colorado‚Äôs statutes, with a few departures. It applies to businesses that, during the preceding calendar year:\n\nControlled or processed personal data of 100,000 or more Connecticut residents, excluding residents whose personal data is controlled or processed solely to complete a payment transaction; or\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of not less than 25,000 consumers and derived more than 25% of their gross revenue from the sale of personal data.\n\nThe law is the first to specify that payment transaction data is not subject to the law, which is for small businesses that process information to complete a transaction, such as restaurants. Consumers can opt out of data processing for the purposes of targeted advertisements, sale to a third party, and profiling.\n\nThe state allowed a 60-day period to remedy violations, though the cure period expired December 31, 2024.\n\nMontana Consumer Data Privacy Act (MTCDPA)\n\nMontana Governor Greg Gianforte signed the Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act (MTCDPA) into law on May 19, 2023, and the law went into effect on October 1, 2024.\n\nThe MTCDPA applies to any data controller that handles the personal data of at least 50,000 Montana residents, except for data used exclusively for payment transactions. Additionally, controllers that manage personal data from at least 25,000 consumers and derive more than 25% of their revenue from selling personal data also must comply with the law. Notably, there is no revenue threshold associated with the MTCDPA.\n\nUnder the law, Montanans have the right to opt out of the sale of their personal data, the right to know if a controller is processing their personal information and access to that data, the right to request the correction of inaccurate or outdated information, the right to ask a controller to delete their personal data, the right to portability, and the right to not be discriminated against for exercising their rights.\n\nThe MTCDPA includes the usual range of exemptions, including government agencies, nonprofits, higher education institutions, national securities associations registered under the Securities Exchange Act, organizations governed by GLBA, and organizations subject to HIPAA.\n\nOne of the more unique features of the law is that it doesn't specify a particular dollar amount for fines or other statutory damages for breaking the law. It simply states that the Attorney General can take legal action. Businesses will also have a 60-day cure period to address any violations, though this period expires April 1, 2026.\n\nTennessee Information Protection Act (TIPA)\n\nThe Tennessee Information Protection Act (TIPA), signed into law in May 2023 and effective from July 1, 2025, positions Tennessee among states taking proactive steps in consumer privacy. The TIPA applies to businesses exceeding $25 million in revenue that engage with Tennessee or its residents and either:\n\nControl or process the personal information of at least 175,000 consumers.\n\nControl or process the personal information of at least 25,000 consumers and derive more than 50 percent of gross revenue from the sale of personal information.\n\nConsumer rights under TIPA include the ability to confirm, access, correct, delete, and obtain personal information. The law places responsibilities on data controllers, emphasizing data minimization, security practices, and non-discrimination.\n\nIn contrast with other state laws, the TIPA provides a narrower applicability threshold, a generous two-plus-year on-ramp period for businesses, and an affirmative defense option for those with written privacy programs aligned with specified frameworks like NIST. In this circumstance, an affirmative defense helps protect businesses against liability. Because of these and other unique features, the TIPA is one of the more business-friendly U.S. privacy laws.\n\nEnforcement falls under the state attorney general, with a 60-day cure period for violators. Penalties may include fines up to $7,500 per violation, with the potential for tripled damages for willful violations.\n\nOregon Consumer Privacy Act (OCPA)\n\nThe Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (OCPA) represents Oregon's response to the absence of a federal privacy law. Signed into law in July 2023, the OCPA became effective on July 1, 2024, concurrently with Texas's privacy law. The law applies to businesses conducting operations in Oregon or providing services to its residents and either:\n\nControl or process the personal data of 100,000 or more consumers.\n\nControl or process the personal data of 25,000 or more consumers while deriving a quarter or more of their annual gross revenue from selling personal data.\n\nNotable exemptions to the OCPA involve information governed by acts like HIPAA and GLBA like other state laws. However, the OCPA is distinct that entities subject to these acts must still comply with the OCPA for non-covered data. The law grants consumers the usual rights, including access, correction, deletion, and opt-out options for targeted advertising or profiling. Controllers must respond to requests within 45 days, extendable by an additional 45 days, and provide justification for any rejection.\n\nUnique features of the OCPA include its data-level exemptions for HIPAA and GLBA (as opposed to entity-level exemptions) and its broad definition of sensitive data. The OCPA includes the usual items under the umbrella of sensitive data, but also includes data types like an individual‚Äôs status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, and more.\n\nEnforcement falls under the state attorney general, with potential fines up to $7,500 per violation. Unlike some state laws, the OCPA incorporates a 30-day right to cure, a five-year statute of limitations, and provisions for additional fees if the attorney general prevails in an action.\n\nTexas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA)\n\nThe Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA), signed into law on June 18, 2023, by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, positions Texas as the second-largest state (after California) to enact a comprehensive data privacy law.\n\nUnique aspects of the TDPSA include a deviation from traditional applicability criteria, replacing revenue-based thresholds with a focus on businesses conducting operations in Texas and offer products or services consumed by Texas residents, or businesses that process or sell personal data. Notably, it introduces a novel small business provision, and while exclusions exist for entities such as state agencies and financial institutions, the law does not provide a general exemption for entities governed by HIPAA or GLBA, requiring compliance for non-covered data.\n\nConsumer rights granted by the TDPSA align with common privacy laws, allowing residents to confirm, correct, delete, and obtain copies of their personal data, along with opting out of targeted advertising or data sale. The law became enforceable on July 1, 2024. Businesses gaining a grace period until January 1, 2025, to comply with the global opt-out technology provision. A distinctive feature is the perpetual 30-day cure period, allowing violators to rectify breaches and avoid penalties by providing the attorney general with evidence of compliance.\n\nThe TDPSA introduces unique provisions, such as additional disclosures for companies selling sensitive or biometric information, and explicit notices for data sale on targeted advertising.\n\nThe law is enforceable by the state attorney general, who can issue fines of up to $7,500 per violation.\n\nIowa Consumer Data Protection Act (ICDPA)\n\nThe Iowa Consumer Data Protection Act (ICDPA) was signed into law in late March, 2023, by Governor Kim Reynolds, and goes into effect on January 1, 2025.\n\nThe ICDPA applies to businesses controlling or processing the personal data of at least 100,000 Iowa consumers or 25,000 consumers with over 50% of gross revenue from data sales. Exemptions include data regulated by the FCRA, state agencies, financial institutions under GLBA, and entities complying with HIPAA.\n\nConsumer rights under the ICDPA include confirmation of data processing, deletion rights, access to personal data, and the right to opt out of data sales. While similar to other state laws, ICDPA notably lacks explicit provisions for the right to correct personal data and the right to opt out of profiling. In response to consumers exercising their rights, the law sets a 90-day timeline for responses and requires businesses to provide information free of charge up to twice annually per consumer.\n\nEnforcement, managed by the state attorney general, incorporates a perpetual 90-day cure period for violators before fines of $7,500 per violation are imposed. The ICDPA does not grant a private right of action.\n\nIndiana Consumer Data Protection Act (INCDPA)\n\nThe Indiana Consumer Data Protection Act (INCDPA) became the seventh state to adopt a privacy law on May 1, 2023. Effective from January 1, 2026, the INCDPA follows the footsteps of similar state laws, emphasizing consumer rights and establishing guidelines for data safeguarding.\n\nThe INCDPA applies to businesses operating in Indiana or selling products and services to Indiana residents that control or process personal data of either 100,000 or 25,000 Indiana residents. Unlike other data privacy laws, the INCDPA doesn't solely rely on a revenue threshold, requiring compliance even if annual gross revenues fall below a specific limit.\n\nConsumer rights granted by the INCDPA include the ability to correct data inaccuracies; opt out of targeted advertising, data sales, or specific profiling; confirm data processing; and request the deletion of personal data. Exemptions exclude state entities, affiliates of financial institutions, organizations subject to HIPAA, non-profit entities, higher education institutions, and public utility entities. Controllers must adhere to principles like data minimization, implement security measures, and conduct data protection impact assessments (DPIA) for specific data processing activities. These include targeted advertising, data sale, profiling with foreseeable risks, processing of sensitive data, and other activities with heightened risk.\n\nEnforcement of the INCDPA involves a 30-day cure period for alleged violations before civil penalties of up to $7,500 per violation are imposed. The attorney general oversees enforcement and may grant injunctive relief. The law emphasizes a business-friendly approach, providing a substantial window for compliance preparation.\n\nDelaware Personal Data Privacy Act (DPDPA)\n\nDelaware joined the growing list of U.S. states enacting comprehensive data privacy legislation with the Delaware Personal Data Privacy Act (DPDPA), positioned as one of the nation's most robust data privacy bills. While California still holds the title for the strongest data privacy law, the DPDPA is notable for its consumer-friendly approach and broader applicability, encompassing businesses of varying sizes. Set to take effect on January 1, 2025, the law grants an additional year for businesses to implement universal opt-out mechanisms in 2026.\n\nApplicability under the DPDPA is extensive, covering any company conducting business in Delaware or offering products/services targeting state residents. The thresholds for compliance are set at processing the personal data of at least 35,000 consumers or 10,000 consumers with over 20% of gross revenue derived from personal data sales. Notably, the 35,000-consumer threshold is the lowest among existing data privacy laws, making the DPDPA applicable to a broader range of small and medium-sized companies.\n\nExemptions under the DPDPA include government bodies, financial institutions subject to the GLBA, and various types of data, such as protected health information under HIPAA. Consumer rights align with other state laws, encompassing the right to confirm and access personal data, correct inaccuracies, delete data, obtain data copies, receive a list of third-party disclosures, and opt-out of targeted advertising, data sale, or profiling. Controllers are obliged to limit data collection to what is necessary, implement security measures, and obtain opt-in consent for sensitive data or data of known children.\n\nEnforcement falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice, allowing a cure period for violators, albeit with a sunset provision ending on January 1, 2026. The Department may investigate and prosecute violations, potentially resulting in penalties up to $10,000 per violation. The law also mandates data protection assessments for activities with a heightened risk of harm to consumers, such as targeted advertising or processing sensitive data.\n\nNebraska Data Privacy Act (NDPA)\n\nThe Nebraska Data Privacy Act (NDPA) is a comprehensive data privacy act designed to protect consumers and give them control over their personal information. It grants them certain rights, outlined below, and provides controllers, or the entity that determines the purpose and means of processing personal data, with specific requirements for how to handle data and consumer requests related to their data.\n\nThe law‚Äôs scope tracks closely with the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA), including its applicability, sensitive data, and its requirement to honor universal opt-out mechanisms.\n\nLike the TDPSA, Nebraska‚Äôs privacy law applies to a person who:\n\nConducts business in the state or produces a product or service consumed by residents of Nebraska;\n\nProcesses or engages in the sale of personal data; and\n\nIs not a small business as determined under the federal Small Business Act.\n\nOne notable aspect of the NDPA‚Äôs applicability is that, unlike most other state laws, there is no revenue or volume of data processed.\n\nLike many other comprehensive data privacy laws, the state attorney general has enforcement authority of the data privacy act. The law stipulates that the attorney general must first notify the controller or processor of the violation in writing and provide a 30-day cure period‚Äîluckily for Nebraska businesses, this cure period does not sunset, unlike other state data privacy laws.\n\nIn addition to curing the violation, the controller or process must also provide a written statement and supportive documentation to show the violation was cured and stating that they will not commit another violation.\n\nThose who don‚Äôt cure a violation during the 30-day timeframe, or who breach their written statement, will be subject to a $7,500 fine for each infraction.\n\nNew Hampshire Privacy Act (NHPA)\n\nThe New Hampshire Privacy Act (NHPA) is one of a number of statewide data privacy laws aimed at giving consumers control over their personal data in an increasingly digital world.\n\nThe good news for businesses is that the NHPA largely resembles other data privacy laws that have come before it. It is most closely aligned to those in Virginia (VCDPA) and Connecticut (CTDPA)‚Äîthough there are slight nuances.\n\nThe law is slated to take effect January 1, 2025, and will apply to ‚Äúpersons that conduct business‚Äù in the state or who produce products or services targeted to residents of New Hampshire and who, during a one-year period:\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of not less than 35,000 unique consumers, excluding if the processing occurred solely to complete a payment transaction, or\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of not less than 10,000 unique consumers and derived more than 25 percent of their gross revenue from the sale of personal data.\n\nThe New Hampshire data privacy act‚Äôs scope is somewhat unique in that it doesn‚Äôt include a revenue threshold. Additionally, the applicability threshold is lower than other laws, but lawmakers have pointed out that this is because of the state‚Äôs lower population.\n\nLike other U.S. laws, the NHPA follows primarily an opt-out model, meaning businesses are free to process consumer data, but must notify consumers about the processing first and give them a way to opt out of the collection or sale of data. There are exceptions, however, for the data of children under the age of 13 and for sensitive data. Here, opt-in permission is required.\n\nOther notable provisions include:\n\nThe NHPA will require businesses to recognize universal opt-out mechanisms, such as the Global Privacy Control.\n\nThe act has a 60-day cure period for violations that sunsets one year after the law is enacted (in January 2026).\n\nNew Jersey Data Privacy Act (NJDPA)\n\nThe New Jersey Data Protection Act (NJDPA) is a data privacy law that gives New Jersey residents control over their personal data, providing certain rights and imposing obligations on those who control and process consumer data. The law applies to businesses and entities who conduct business in the state or who produce products or services targeted to those who live in New Jersey.\n\nIn terms of applicability and exemptions, New Jersey‚Äôs privacy law aligns with other state laws. It applies to controllers who, during a calendar year, meet one of the following criteria:\n\nControl or process the personal data of at least 100,000 consumers, excluding personal data processed solely for the purpose of completing a payment transaction, or\n\nControl or process the personal data of at least 25,000 consumers and the controller derives revenue or receives a discount on the price of any goods or services, from the sale of personal data.\n\nThere are a few key definitions in the law: the NJDPA defines ‚Äúsale‚Äù as ‚Äúsharing, disclosing, or transferring‚Äù data for money or other valuable consideration, similar to California‚Äôs law. A ‚Äúcontroller‚Äù is an individual or legal entity that determines the purpose and means of processing personal data.\n\nSimilar to Colorado‚Äôs privacy law, it doesn‚Äôt define a specific percentage of revenue that must be derived from the sale of data, whereas other states have implemented a 25 or 50 percent threshold.\n\nThe law goes into effect in January 15, 2025, one year after its enactment.\n\nKentucky Consumer Data Protection Act (KCDPA)\n\nThe Kentucky Consumer Data Protection Ac (KCDPA) provides data privacy protections for consumers of the Bluegrass State, granting them certain, now standard rights. We‚Äôll dive into more on that later.\n\nThe law defines consumers as residents of the state acting only as an individual, not in commercial or employment contexts. It closely aligns with Virginia‚Äôs law, which is good news for businesses already complying with the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA). And, because the VCDPA is considered a framework or foundation legislation, the KCDPA also tracks closely with other state laws that used Virginia‚Äôs law as a framework, including Tennessee and Indiana.\n\nBusinesses will become subject to the law as of January 1, 2026.\n\nSimilar to Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Indiana, Kentucky‚Äôs privacy act allows companies to collect and process most types of personal information without obtaining affirmative user consent first (in most cases). This is known as the opt-out model, which most U.S. data privacy laws follow.\n\nJust like Virginia‚Äôs law, the KCDPA applies to any person who conducts business in Kentucky or who produces products or services that target residents of the state, and during a calendar year controls or processes data of at least:\n\n100,000 consumers; or\n\n25,000 consumers and derives over 50 percent of gross revenue from the sale of personal data.\n\nLike all data privacy laws that came before it, the KCDPA applies to both controllers, or entities who determine the purpose and means of processing data, and processors, or entities that process personal data on behalf of a controller, such as a third-party vendor charged with analyzing data. The delineation between controllers and processors exists to clearly assign responsibilities for data governance between the parties involved in collecting and processing consumer data.\n\nMinnesota Consumer Data Privacy Act (MCDPA)\n\nThe MCDPA is a state-level legislation designed to safeguard the personal data of Minnesota residents. Rather than permit organizations to collect, process, and generally do whatever they wish with consumers‚Äô personal information, data privacy regulations like the MCDPA:\n\nSet limits on what organizations can do with personal data\n\nRequire organizations to meet certain obligations, like setting safeguards, assessing for risk, and respecting consumer rights\n\nProvide consumers with data privacy rights that enable them to maintain control over their personal information\n\nOfficially enacted on May 24, 2024, the MCDPA will take effect on July 31, 2025. Once that happens, businesses will need to comply or potentially suffer penalties and fines from the state Attorney General.\n\nThe MCDPA applies to organizations that provide products or services targeted at Minnesotans and meet one of the following criteria:\n\nDuring a calendar year, they control or process the personal data of 100,000 consumers or more.\n\nThey derive more than 25 percent of gross revenue from the sale of personal data and process or control personal data of 25,000 consumers or more.\n\nAs is the case with most data privacy laws, the definition of ‚Äúsale‚Äù includes both selling data for money and ‚Äúother valuable considerations.‚Äù\n\nMaryland Online Data Privacy Act (MODPA)\n\nThe MODPA gives Maryland residents more control over how companies collect and use their personal data online. With an effective date of October 1, 2025, the new law establishes data protection rights and requires companies that track or target the state‚Äôs residents to meet stricter requirements around data collection‚Äîespecially related to data minimization, consent, universal opt-out mechanisms, sensitive data, and children‚Äôs data. However, MODPA will not apply to companies‚Äô data processing activities until April 1st, 2026.\n\nWhile it is an opt-out law (meaning consumers have the right to opt-out of processing data for certain purposes) Maryland‚Äôs privacy act is already known in the data privacy world as more stringent than many other state laws.\n\nMaryland‚Äôs privacy law applies to anyone who conducts business in the state, as well as those who provide services or products targeted to residents of Maryland and during the prior calendar year either:\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of at least 35,000 consumers, with the exception of personal data collected or processed solely for completing a payment transaction, or:\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of at least 10,000 consumers and derived more than 20 percent of its gross revenue from the sale of personal data.\n\nWith controller requirements and restrictions, the MODPA gets tricky. It differs from other state laws in a few key areas.\n\nIn Maryland, controllers are restricted from the collection, processing, and sharing of sensitive data, except where it‚Äôs strictly necessary to provide or maintain a specific product or service requested by the consumer.\n\nWhat‚Äôs more, controllers are banned altogether from selling sensitive data.\n\nThe Maryland Office of the Attorney General's Consumer Protection Division enforces the MCPA, which has fines of up to $10,000 per violation or $25,000 for each repetition of the same violation.\n\nThe Rhode Island Data Transparency and Privacy Protection Act (RIDTPPA)\n\nEnacted June 29, 2024, the RIDTPPA resembles many other US data privacy laws, including its requirements surrounding consent, sensitive personal information processing, and consumer rights. The law, however, does feature several important differences.\n\nNotably, the law also lacks a cure period. If you‚Äôre found to have violated the law, you‚Äôll simply be fined without any grace period to fix the violation. Most state data privacy laws feature cure periods, though some expire at various dates in the future, and some are permanent features.\n\nThe law also does not require businesses to honor universal opt-out mechanisms.\n\nIf your organization is a for-profit entity and conducts business in Rhode Island or provides products or services targeted to Rhode Islanders, you may be subject to the RIDTPPA.\n\nSpecifically, you must meet the above criteria as well as one of the following:\n\nYour organization controlled or processed at least 35,000 state residents‚Äô personal data.\n\nYour organization controlled or processed at least 10,000 state residents‚Äô personal data and derived more than 20% of its gross revenue from the sale of that data.\n\nThere are exemptions, of course, but if you meet the above criteria, you likely will need to comply with the law.\n\nNew York SHIELD Act\n\nIn July 2019, New York passed the Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security (SHIELD) Act. This law amends New York's existing data breach notification law and creates more data security requirements for companies that collect information on New York residents. As of March 2020, the law is fully enforceable.\n\nThis law broadened the scope of consumer privacy and provides better protection for New York residents from data breaches of their personal information. It requires employers in possession of the New York residents‚Äô private information to ‚Äúdevelop, implement, and maintain reasonable safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the private information.‚Äù\n\nLast year, in 2022, the state Attorney General settled with an organization $600,000 for failing to meet minimum standards that led to a breach in security and a leak of personal information. While there have been no recent updates to the law, it is still very active and enforced, as shown by this settlement.\n\nCheck out our U.S. data privacy laws guide for a detailed summary.\n\nEuropean Data Privacy Laws\n\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation remains the law of the land, but new data privacy-related laws have been passed in the EU recently‚Äînotably, the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. Here's a refresher on the GDPR and a list of the other laws you should track to keep your organization up-to-date on data privacy in 2025.\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n\nThe most crucial data protection legislation enacted to date is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It governs the collection, use, transmission, and security of data collected from residents of any of the 28 member countries of the European Union. The law applies to all EU residents, regardless of the entity's location that collects the personal data. Fines of up to ‚Ç¨ 20 million or 4% of total global turnover may be imposed on organizations that fail to comply with the GDPR. Some essential requirements of the GDPR include:\n\nConsent\n\nData subjects must be allowed to give explicit, unambiguous consent before the collection of personal data. Personal data includes information collected through the use of cookies. Some information not usually considered \"personal information\" in the United States, such as the user's computer IP address, is considered to be \"personal data\" according to the GDPR.\n\nData Breach Notification\n\nOrganizations must notify supervisory authorities and data subjects within 72 hours if a data breach affects users' personal information in most cases.\n\nData Subjects' Rights\n\nData subjects (people whose data is collected and processed) have certain rights regarding their personal information. These rights should be communicated to data subjects in a clear, easy-to-access privacy policy on the organization's website.\n\nThe right to be informed. Data subjects must be informed about the collection and use of their personal data when the data is obtained.\n\nThe right to access their data. A data subject can request a copy of their personal data via a data subject request. Data controllers must explain the means of collection, what's being processed, and with whom it is shared.\n\nThe right of rectification. If a data subject's data is inaccurate or incomplete, they have the right to ask you to rectify it.\n\nThe right of erasure. Data subjects have the right to request the erasure of personal data related to them on certain grounds within 30 days.\n\nThe right to restrict processing. Data subjects have the right to request the restriction or suppression of their personal data (though you can still store it).\n\nThe right to data portability. Data subjects can have their data transferred from one electronic system to another at any time safely and securely without disrupting its usability.\n\nThe right to object. Data subjects can object to how their information is used for marketing, sales, or non-service-related purposes. The right to object does not apply where legal or official authority is carried out, a task is carried out for public interest, or when the organization needs to process data to provide you with a service for which you signed up.\n\nDigital Services Act (DSA)\n\nThe new regulation addresses illegal and harmful content by compelling platforms such as Google and Facebook to remove content that doesn‚Äôt meet certain standards. The primary principle is ‚Äúwhat is illegal offline must be illegal online,‚Äù according to the Council of the EU. The Digital Services Act (DSA) entered into force on November 16, 2022.\n\nIt applies to four categories of businesses:\n\nIntermediary services offering network infrastructure, such as ISPs\n\nHosting services, such as cloud and web-hosting services\n\nOnline platforms that bring sellers and consumers together, such as online marketplaces, social platforms, and app stores\n\nVery large online platforms, which are defined as online platforms that reach more than 10% of the 450 million consumers in Europe\n\nEach category faces different requirements.\n\nAll of the above categories must:\n\nEngage in transparency reporting on court orders and actions taken, content moderation efforts, and more\n\nUpdate terms of service to account for fundamental rights\n\nCooperate with national authorities\n\nEstablish points of contact for authorities and, when necessary, legal representatives\n\nHosting services, online platforms, and very large online platforms must:\n\nProvide a notice-and-action mechanism enabling users to note potential illegal content for the business to remove\n\nReport criminal offenses\n\nOnline platforms and very large platforms must:\n\nImplement a complaint and redress mechanism\n\nIdentify trusted flaggers whose expertise adds special weight to their content notices\n\nTake measures against abusive notices and counter-notices\n\nIf they have a marketplace feature, take special actions, such as vetting third-party suppliers‚Äô credentials, adhering to compliance-by-design principles, and more\n\nNot target advertisements to children or target advertisements based on users‚Äô special characteristics\n\nProvide transparency into content recommendation systems\n\nProvide user-facing transparency into online advertising practices\n\nVery large platforms must:\n\nAdopt risk management practices and establish crisis response protocols\n\nAcquiesce to external, independent auditing, establish an internal compliance function, and be publicly accountable\n\nProvide users the choice to not be subject to content recommendations based on profiling\n\nShare data with authorities and researchers\n\nAdhere to self-drafted codes of conduct\n\nCooperate with authorities during crisis response situations\n\nEU data protection authorities may access, obtain information from, and inspect service providers to inform orders and sanctions. If a business is found to be in violation, it may be fined up to 6% of annual global turnover during the preceding financial year. If an information obligation under the DSA is violated, the maximum penalty is limited to 1% of the previous year‚Äôs income or global turnover.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act (DMA)\n\nThe Digital Markets Act (DMA) covers the largest digital platforms, known as ‚Äúgatekeepers,‚Äù which include companies like Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, and Google. The DMA aims to level the playing field for digital companies and prevent gatekeeper companies from imposing unfair conditions on their competitors. For example, a company like Amazon isn‚Äôt allowed to rank products on its site in a way that gives Amazon‚Äôs own products and services an advantage.\n\nA company is considered a gatekeeper if it:\n\nHas a strong economic position, significant impact on the EU market, and is active in multiple EU member states\n\nHas a strong position as an intermediary linking a large user base to a large number of businesses\n\nHas or will soon have an entrenched position in the market, which is determined by whether or not the company met the two previous criteria in the last three financial years\n\nUnder the DMA, businesses that qualify as gatekeepers must:\n\nNot engage in self-preferencing, where the gatekeeper promotes their own products and services over an equivalent third-party product or service on the gatekeeper‚Äôs platform\n\nNot reuse users‚Äô data outside of the context in which it was originally collected without consent\n\nNot track users outside of the gatekeepers‚Äô platform for the purpose of targeted advertising without consent\n\nPermit communication and content access between businesses and end users\n\nEnsure price and fee transparency in advertising intermediation services\n\nProvide access to marketing or advertising performance data on the platform to users\n\nMake it easy for users to change their default settings and uninstall software\n\nEnsure third-party technology can interoperate with the gatekeeper‚Äôs own\n\nEnsure end users‚Äô data is portable to other systems\n\nProvide businesses with real-time access to their data on the gatekeeper‚Äôs platform\n\nNot prevent users from making complaints to authorities\n\nNot require user registration to additional services as a condition of accessing a given service\n\nNot use businesses‚Äô non-public data to compete against them\n\nAnd more\n\nGatekeepers that violate the DMA may be subject to fines of up to 10% of annual global turnover or up to 20% in the case of repeated violations. What‚Äôs more, repeated violations may result in non-financial remedies, such as forced divestitures.\n\nThe EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework\n\nAlthough it isn't a law per se, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework is an important factor to be aware of.\n\nPreviously, businesses transferring EU citizens‚Äô data into the U.S. relied on a framework called the Privacy Shield to ensure the data was sufficiently protected, but that framework was deemed invalid during the Schrems II court case. This forced businesses to rely on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission to provide legal protection for data transfers.\n\nHowever, these clauses are somewhat shaky, which is why there was pressure to get a replacement for the Privacy Shield stood up.\n\nOn July 10, 2023, the new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework went into effect. It includes additional security measures, a redress mechanism for EU and U.S. citizens who feel their rights have been violated, and greater protections for foreign citizens‚Äô data that has been transferred to the U.S. Additionally, the framework requires intelligence agencies to make updates to surveillance-related policies and procedures, followed by a review by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.\n\nWhile the framework improves upon the Privacy Shield, it's not without its flaws. There will likely be criticisms from European privacy advocacy groups, but if the framework survives, it could be the method businesses use to transfer data between the EU and U.S.\n\nThe EU AI Act\n\nThe EU‚Äôs Artificial Intelligence Act was approved on 16 June 2023 and is expected to go into effect sometime in late 2025 or early 2026. It applies to any company doing business in the EU that develops or adopts ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù AI systems. These systems affect employment, credit, health care, and other critical domains.\n\nThe EU AI Act applies extraterritorially, meaning the law will cover companies based elsewhere if they have customers or users inside the EU, effectively making it a global regulation.\n\nUnder the Act, businesses with applicable AI systems have to:\n\nConduct impact assessments, keep records, and meet transparency obligations\n\nNot develop systems that can be used to manipulate a person‚Äôs behavior in a manner that could cause mental or physical harm.\n\nNot develop systems that can be used to exploit the vulnerabilities of a specific group due to their age, physical or mental disabilities, or behavior in a manner that could cause psychological or physical harm.\n\nNot develop systems that could exploit vulnerable groups based on age, or physical or mental disability.\n\nNot develop systems that provide real-time remote biometric data in publicly accessible spaces by law enforcement.\n\nOther International Data Privacy Laws\n\nWith over 130 data privacy laws across the globe, it isn‚Äôt feasible to list and describe each and every one in this blog post. However, here are some important regulations that may apply to your business.\n\nBrazil‚Äôs General Law for the Protection of Personal Data, or the Lei Geral de Prote√ß√£o de Dados Pessoais (LGPD): This law came into effect in 2020 and contains many similar provisions to the GDPR. Learn more about the law in our dedicated blog article, The definitive guide to Brazil's privacy law, the LGPD.\n\nCanada‚Äôs Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA): PIPEDA was assented to in 2000, came into full force in 2004, and was considered a progressive law at the time. It was last updated in 2015 by the Data Privacy Act but still falls short of the GDPR‚Äôs regulatory standard.\n\nChina‚Äôs Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL): PIPL was enacted into law in November of 2021 and broadly maps to the GDPR‚Äôs stipulations. However, it does vary in some of its details, notably by giving individuals fewer rights, requiring a stricter standard for consent, and imposing harsher penalties.\n\nIndia's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA): Significantly, this law covers all of India's 1.4 billion people. While the law broadly mirrors the GDPR, it includes some variation, notably in the form of government exemptions.\n\nReduce Complexity and Risk With a Compliance Platform",
      "# [5 Emerging Data Privacy Trends in 2025 by Matt Davis, CIPM (IAPP) on 2024-12-26](https://www.osano.com/articles/data-privacy-trends)\nHeraclitus said that ‚ÄúThe only constant in life is change,‚Äù but privacy professionals don‚Äôt need to turn to ancient Greek philosophy to grasp this concept. We can just use our eyes and observe our colleagues, industry, governments, and world. Data privacy is constantly changing, and 2025 won‚Äôt be an exception.\n\nKnowing that data privacy is changing and knowing how it‚Äôs changing, however, are two very different things.\n\nHere at Osano, we‚Äôre lucky enough to interact with a great many privacy professionals, businesses, and thought leaders in different industries and countries. As a result, we have a unique vantage point over the privacy landscape. Here's what we expect to see in 2025.\n\n1. Goodbye Chief Privacy Officers; Hello Multi-Hyphenates\n\nWhen the GDPR went into effect in 2018, many organizations believed that it would lead to the creation of a relatively new role‚Äîthe privacy professional.\n\nThere are certainly enough responsibilities associated with privacy compliance to justify the creation of this role. At the same time, it‚Äôs true that privacy is a multi-disciplinary domain; there is virtually no element of the business that isn‚Äôt impacted by or relevant to data privacy.\n\nBusinesses are waking up to the efficiencies that can be gained by treating privacy as a holistic, cross-functional responsibility. New innovations, like AI, are adding to the privacy professional‚Äôs book of responsibilities as well. As a result, organizations are forgoing purely privacy-focused CPOs in favor of cross-functional, multi-hyphenate roles.\n\nWe explored this trend when Osano CEO Arlo Gilbert interviewed Google‚Äôs most recent CPO, Keith Enright, on an episode of The Privacy Insider podcast. Since Enright left, Google has not backfilled the role.\n\nOther major organizations like Mastercard, Zoom, and IBM are tweaking their CPO roles to package them with new AI responsibilities and other compliance domains.\n\nAccording to the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP), over 80% of privacy professionals gained responsibilities in 2024 alongside their existing privacy day jobs. In 2025, we expect this trend to continue and perhaps even intensify as best practices around AI management mature.\n\nMaybe you‚Äôre soon to be a Senior Head of Privacy, Trust, GRC, AI, and Other Acronyms as Applicable?\n\n2. AI Regulation Builds Up Momentum\n\nIn the 2000s and early 2010s, personal data processing was a bit like the Wild West. It took until 2016, with the adoption of the GDPR, for legislatures to become aware of the dangers associated with unrestricted collection and processing. After the GDPR went into effect in 2018, the need for modern comprehensive privacy protections became clear to the rest of the world.\n\nLegislatures don‚Äôt appear to be making the same mistake with AI. When ChatGPT came out in late 2022, regulators were off to the races, acknowledging the danger that LLMs and other novel AI technologies could pose to citizens and their rights. In the intervening years, new regulations and laws around AI have been released. In 2025, we expect this momentum to continue, and more businesses will have to contend with new requirements.\n\nAs of this writing, six American states have some kind of AI regulation in effect, with three more in the works. Colorado‚Äôs AI Act (CAIA) is among the most comprehensive. Although it goes into effect in early 2026, developers and users of AI systems will likely need a long runway to prepare for compliance.\n\nLike the CAIA, the EU‚Äôs AI Act enters fully into force in 2026. However, elements of the law go into effect over the course of 2025 as follows:\n\nProhibitions on AI systems that pose unacceptable risks take effect on February 2, 2025. These are systems that are simply too risky to deploy and are banned outright, including social scoring, biometric categorization systems, and untargeted scraping of facial data.\n\nRequirements for general-purpose AI models take effect on August 2, 2025. Among other requirements, developers of genAI will be obligated to assess and mitigate systemic risks, provide ample documentation on things like training data, provide adequate security, and more.\n\n3. Our Bet: The Majority of States Will Have a Privacy Law; We Won‚Äôt See a Federal Privacy Law\n\nSeven states passed comprehensive data privacy laws in 2024 and in 2023. If that pace continues in 2025, we could see 26 out of 50 states with their own privacy law. With more than half of US jurisdictions covered by a privacy law, it‚Äôll be increasingly likely that businesses will be subject to at least some of these laws.\n\nThis explosion in state data privacy regulation also implies the implosion of a federal data privacy law‚Äôs prospects. As we‚Äôve seen with proposed legislation like the APRA and ADPPA, states like California don‚Äôt want a weaker federal bill that essentially downgrades the privacy protections it offers to its citizens. The more states that have skin in the game, the less likely a nationwide law will be passed.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt ideal for businesses, as compliance with a single law would surely be easier than complying with potentially dozens. Check out our guide to US data privacy laws for a state-by-state overview.\n\n4. SRRs Take Center Stage\n\n2025 may very well be the year of subject rights requests (SRRs).\n\nThe IAPP reports that in 2023 (the latest year for which they have data), the average organization received around 3,000 SRRs. In North America specifically, that figure jumped to around 3,500.\n\nTo be fair, this figure is drawn from a sample of organizations employing IAPP members and is therefore biased toward organizations with enough privacy responsibilities that they employ a privacy professional. Nevertheless, with eight new data privacy laws coming online in 2025, more organizations are going to be on the hook for SRR response.\n\nNot only do more laws mean more organizations must honor SRRs, but they also translate to more consumer awareness. When residents in a newly covered jurisdiction hear about their new rights or the enforcement priorities of their state‚Äôs Attorney General, some portion will decide to exercise their subject rights.\n\nAs new laws come online, consent management will be important as well. However, more organizations understand the need for consent management (at least superficially). Seeing cookie banners on every website lends a lot to that awareness. In contrast, SRRs happen behind the scenes. Thus, it‚Äôs likely a number of organizations will be surprised by and unprepared for their new responsibilities to data subjects.\n\n5. As Always, Regulatory, Sectorial, and Private Enforcement Is on the Rise\n\nAs we covered earlier, eight new laws are coming online in 2025‚Äîand we can expect the attorneys general in those jurisdictions to show that they‚Äôve got bite to match their bark. That will certainly be the case with California and Texas.\n\nThe California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) has announced a number of investigatory sweeps in 2024, and there‚Äôs every reason to expect that to continue in 2025. The state is also the only jurisdiction in the US (thus far) to issue financial penalties for non-compliance with its comprehensive data privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA; Sephora in 2022, DoorDash in early 2024, and Tilting Point Media in mid-2024).\n\nWhile Texas hasn‚Äôt issued any enforcement actions under the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA) as of this writing, the Texas Attorney General‚Äôs office has been very vocal about its intention to do so. The Texas Attorney General, however, has secured a settlement against an AI company for deceptive trade practices and issued a penalty against TikTok under the SCOPE act, which protects children‚Äôs data.\n\nIn terms of private enforcement, the plaintiff‚Äôs bar has repurposed the VPPA and various wiretapping laws to go after companies using tracking pixels on their websites. California, Arizona, and Florida are particularly known for such wiretapping cases.\n\nWhile this line of litigation has been very popular in 2024, it may become a degree less common, at least in Massachusetts, where the state Supreme Court ruled that the Wiretap Act does not cover website tracking technology. This ruling could influence other courts in the coming year‚Äîif not, we can expect more lawsuits of this nature.\n\nLast but not least, we can expect GDPR enforcement to continue apace. As of November 2024, there have been over 5.3 billion euros in GDPR penalties spread out over more than 2,200 fines.\n\nPrepare for These Changes with Osano\n\nWhether you‚Äôre a seasoned privacy pro or just had privacy tacked onto your list of responsibilities, meeting the challenges these trends present won‚Äôt be easy.\n\nIf, like many professionals, you‚Äôre finding your scope expanding, you‚Äôll need a solution that automates tedious privacy tasks‚Äîthat way, you can develop a holistic strategy across your responsibilities without having to worry about, for example, the nitty gritty of each privacy impact assessment.\n\nAnd if AI is among those new responsibilities, solutions for consent and notice management will be especially important. For now, there isn‚Äôt a reliable way to exercise the ‚Äúright to be forgotten‚Äù for data ingested in an AI model, making it all the more important that consumers know when and where their data interacts with an AI system.\n\nYour organization may be subject to the new laws coming into effect in 2025 as well. Solutions like Osano have regulatory knowledge baked into their functionality, helping you keep track of multi-jurisdictional requirements. That includes subject rights management, which we predict will be especially challenging in 2025.",

      "# [Data Privacy Automation: Complying with Ease by Osano Staff on 2025-02-04](https://www.osano.com/articles/data-privacy-automation)\nWhen people say \"data is the new oil,\" they're usually referring to its value. But in reality, oil requires careful handlin, management, storage, protection, and processing before it can be turned into a truly valuable resource. The same can be said fo data.\n\nConsumer data, especially sensitive personal data, is protected by laws and needs to be treated with respect and handled responsibly. Not only does this help you avoid fines for non-compliance, it earns consumer trust, improves data governance, and strengthens your brand.\n\nAll things being equal, anyone would want to handle their consumers‚Äô personal and sensitive data respectfully and responsibly‚Äîeven without the threat of financial penalties. But responsible data handling approached from the wrong angle can be time-consuming and expensive. Fortunately, data privacy automation can make it easy to respect your consumers‚Äô privacy rights and win all the benefits that respect entails.\n\nWhat Does Data Privacy Automation Mean?\n\nData privacy automation is when you use digital tools and technology to carry out data privacy tasks and processes, freeing up your employees to focus on activities that cannot be undertaken by software. It can help you save a considerable amount of time.\n\nIn the case of a business collecting personal information from your consumers, data privacy can be quite complicated. The various processes involved in data privacy management can be listed as follows:\n\nData mapping\n\nCookie consent management\n\nUnified consent and preference management\n\nSubject rights management\n\nAssessments\n\nVendor and third-party risk management\n\nYou‚Äôre looking at thousands, if not tens or hundreds of thousands, of consumers. Any data you collect from them has to be managed and its privacy maintained. At the same time, you must consider and honor their preferences.\n\nIf, at any time, they want access to their personal data, you should be able to provide it to them within a reasonable period of time (generally, 30 or 45 days depending on the governing regulation). You also need to evaluate your processes from time to time and change them as your data collection and processing requirements change.\n\nFinally, if you share any personal information of your consumers with vendors and third parties, you also need to make sure they follow privacy regulations and don‚Äôt compromise data privacy.\n\nThat‚Äôs a lot of processes, especially if you do them all manually. It becomes even more complicated when you realize your data collection and processing needs change over time. You might need additional categories of personal data because your business changed or expanded its services.\n\nAlternatively, if you invest in new technologies, it might mean you don‚Äôt need as much personal information from consumers, or you might need different kinds of personal information. As your business processes change, so do your data collection and storage requirements.\n\nYou‚Äôre handling a large number of moving parts, and you have to deal with them without compromising the integrity of your consumers‚Äô personal data. Done manually, this can be pretty time-consuming‚Äînot to mention prone to error.\n\nAutomating data privacy compliance makes your privacy management easier.\n\nWhy Do You Need Data Privacy Automation?\n\nIf data privacy can be managed manually, do you even need automation? What benefits does it offer?\n\nAccuracy\n\nWhen you‚Äôre managing your consumers‚Äô data with privacy in mind, you have to follow several processes. Some of these may require copying information from the form or email the user sent into a database or spreadsheet.\n\nFor example, let‚Äôs say you were handling consent requests through static forms. That would mean someone would have to take the preferences the user has listed and implement them across all your platforms manually. This is usually not a problem if you‚Äôre doing it once or twice a day.\n\nHowever, if you‚Äôre an enterprise with hundreds and thousands of these coming in, the sheer tedium and repetitiveness of the task will mean a human will eventually lose focus and make a mistake.\n\nWhen you use a software solution to automate tthe process of managing privacy, you don‚Äôt have to worry about human error or bias, which might creep into decisions when rules are applied with subjective interpretations.\n\nSpeed\n\nComputing tools are known for their speed of processing. Ask a chatbot to give you a 500-word essay on the subject of your choice, and it will generate it in seconds. Ask a human to do the same, and they will take anywhere from 20 minutes to a few hours, depending on their knowledge of the topic.\n\nIf a human wants to ensure accuracy, they must sacrifice speed, but a person, even if they are careless, cannot work as quickly as a computer. Automation tools speed up your privacy management tasks without sacrificing accuracy.\n\nThey also enable real-time response to user requests, which can help your reputation in the market.\n\nEasier Compliance\n\nPart of the requirements of data privacy regulations like the GDPR is accountability. You must have records of user consent, audits, privacy protection and data security measures. It is possible to keep these records in a paper-based format, but creating and producing them when required is time-consuming.\n\nAutomation streamlines the audit process dramatically. All your information is stored digitally in a centralized point. You can even save the results of previous audits and retrieve them with a few clicks.\n\nIf the automated system detects a compliance risk or potential breach, it can alert you before the issue becomes a bigger problem. Automation can also ensure that your privacy practices are aligned with regulations without much manual intervention.\n\nHeightened Data Security\n\nWhen you automate privacy, you also enhance your data security. Privacy automation tools also map your data and prioritize systems with higher data risk. This helps you focus your security efforts on the datasets that need it most. Part of mapping data is understanding how it flows and the relationship between systems. Understanding this can enable you to identify any weak points in the data lifecycle.\n\nThese tools also flag irrelevant or deprecated data stores so they aren‚Äôt scanned, which helps to reduce your attack surface.\n\nOne of the principles of data privacy is data minimization. Storing only relevant data can be useful in reducing your storage costs and the potential impact of a breach. By automating data discovery and classification and flagging deprecated stores, automation tools inform you of any excess data you might have in your stores.\n\nWhat Should Privacy Program Automation Cover?\n\nAutomated Data Mapping\n\nData mapping is the process of identifying and inventorying the information you have and where it‚Äôs stored. Consumer data comes in many forms and types. It‚Äôs exactly like bits of information you‚Äôve gathered from your friends. And, because it‚Äôs so varied, it‚Äôs stored in different places and formats.\n\nIt‚Äôs very difficult to implement data privacy solutions if you don‚Äôt know where your data lives, what‚Äôs being done to it, and where it‚Äôs going. Data mapping can help you identify your data stores; privacy risks; and outstanding compliance tasks like assessments, deletions, or needed security controls.\n\nWhen you automate the data mapping process, it becomes faster and more accurate. For example, you can connect Osano to your single sign-on (SSO) provider to find connected systems where your consumers‚Äô personal information is stored and processed without having to manually identify each and every system in your organization.\n\nEven if you have some data stores that aren‚Äôt connected to your SSO, Osano‚Äôs semi-automated assessment workflows make it less tedious to discover and onboard data stores into your data map. Our data privacy automation platform helps you streamline the process of manual data discovery and verification.\n\nOur solution also automatically identifies each system‚Äôs privacy risk, flagging high-risk systems so you can apply security and privacy controls or come back to reevaluate them when needed.\n\nCookie Consent Management\n\nIf your website uses first- or third-party cookies to collect information and track the usage of your customers, you need a cookie consent banner. Most data privacy regulations insist that you inform viewers that you‚Äôre using cookies so they can give informed consent to be tracked.\n\nDepending on the jurisdiction, you might have to gain their explicit opt-in before you can collect any data, or you might just have to give them the ability to opt out and withdraw consent.\n\nIf you do it manually, someone must implement cookie banners, integrate opt-in and opt-out functionality with your tag manager, configure the categories, and track user preferences. You‚Äôll also need to ensure your website can accept universal opt-out signals, like the Global Privacy Control.\n\nAutomating cookie consent management with a tool like Osano requires just a line of JavaScript on your website header, and you can implement customized cookie banners. Osano automatically recommends cookie categories, which you can review and approve or adjust. It also stores a record of consumer preferences and enables consumers to adjust their preferences in compliance with privacy regulations.\n\nIn short, Osano can help you lay the foundation for compliance in over 50 countries in a matter of minutes.\n\nUniversal Consent and Preference Management\n\nWhere cookie consent only deals with website cookies and whether users are happy to have those trackers dropped on their browser, universal consent and preference management focuses on consent across various non-cookie-based tracking activities and communication channels.\n\nIf you were to gather consent and preferences manually, you‚Äôd need to either develop your own in-house universal consent and preference management solution or collect consumer preferences through individual forms across individual channels. Then, you‚Äôd need to manually adjust the various systems you use to collect data and send out communications or maintain an integration with those systems. That might look like reviewing an individual‚Äôs email communication preferences submitted via a form and then moving that individual to a list in your email client populated with other individuals who‚Äôve signalled the same preference.\n\nOr, you might have to dive into your content management system (CMS) to flag that you shouldn‚Äôt collect data from a certain IP address. For one or two consumers, honoring their requests in compliance with regulation wouldn‚Äôt be a problem; for hundreds or thousands, it‚Äôd be overwhelming.\n\nWith automated consent and preference management, however, you can dynamically collect, process, and immediately implement user preferences. Most importantly, you can do so across platforms, so your consumers can enjoy a unified experience, no matter where they interact with your business.\n\nUsing a privacy program automation solution will also make it easier for your users to manage their privacy preferences and make it easier for you to comply with their wishes.\n\nData Protection and Privacy Impact Assessments\n\nPIAs and DPIAs play an important role in managing and ensuring privacy. They make you take a closer look at your processes so you can find flaws that could affect consumer data privacy.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note that while PIAs don‚Äôt have a strict format, they are required under most US state privacy laws. Generally, organizations follow standards set by NIST or ISO when carrying out PIAs. DPIAs have a more prescriptive format and are a requirement under the GDPR. Since it can be difficult to identify the right format on your own, Osano provides templates for both DPIAs and standards-based PIAs.\n\nThe challenge in manual privacy assessments isn‚Äôt necessarily that they take a long time to do. Individual assessments aren‚Äôt too time-consuming, but they do add up en masse. The main challenges with manual privacy assessments are that they are bottlenecks to carrying out a project or task and often require collaboration from stakeholders across the business. While you wait for a team lead in another department to provide crucial information, your colleagues are waiting to get started on their initiative.\n\nHowever, automating the workflow can mitigate these challenges. You can use pre-built assessment templates based on security standards and customize them to your needs. Stakeholders assigned to different assessments receive notifications when they‚Äôre falling behind, and you can automatically send out new batches for periodic assessments.\n\nThe Osano privacy management platform will also tell you which assessments have been completed and if there are any outstanding. Plus, all your results are stored in one place and can be retrieved easily for compliance audits.\n\nSubject Rights Management\n\nWhen you have the records of hundreds or thousands of consumers, finding the information of one customer can be time-consuming. While you do get a ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù amount of time to fulfill a DSAR, processing such a request manually can be very tedious.\n\nAutomating subject rights management can save you time and make the process much more efficient. For example, Osano automatically identifies relevant data subject records and processes common request types, like summaries and deletions, pending human verification.\n\nVendor and Third-Party Risk Management\n\nIf you rely on vendors for certain services or share data with third parties, you want them to be just as committed to consumer data privacy as you are.\n\nIf you think they‚Äôre high-risk, you‚Äôll need to monitor them more closely. You also want to know if they have had any privacy policy changes or any lawsuits against them that could affect your consumers‚Äô privacy.\n\nDiscovering and tracking this information manually would require a dedicated team constantly following all your vendors and third-party service providers. Fortunately, it‚Äôs a lot easier to do with an automated vendor risk management platform.\n\nOsano‚Äôs platform includes a database of tens of thousands of vendors and generates a privacy risk score for each, enabling you to build a shortlist of trustworthy vendors before you start onboarding. Osano also automatically tracks lawsuits, data breaches, and privacy policy changes for vendors you select, alerting you to vendors who may have put you at risk.\n\nAutomating Data Privacy With Osano",

      "# [PII Compliance Requirements & Best Practices by Osano Staff on 2025-02-03](https://www.osano.com/articles/pii-compliance)\nBusinesses need data from consumers, and the sharing and selling of this resource has become quite common. However, you also need to be mindful of the rights of the people whose data you collect, especially their personally identifiable information (PII). In fact, if your business stores, processes, and shares consumer data, PII compliance is a legal requirement under numerous laws.\n\nWhat Is PII?\n\nPII is any personal information collected by a business that could be linked to the individual it belongs to, either directly or when combined with other information.\n\nPII stands for personally identifiable information, and, as the name suggests, it‚Äôs information that belongs to an individual and‚Äîeither by itself or in combination with other bits of data‚Äîcan be used to identify them.\n\nThe most obvious piece of PII is a person‚Äôs full name. Another is their address because while a name can be shared by a few people (depending on how common it is), an address is a bit more specific.\n\nSince PII can identify the data subject (i.e., the individual who owns it) it‚Äôs regulated by data privacy laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\n\nHere‚Äôs a list of data that could be considered PII:\n\nDirect Identifiers\n\nName (full name, first name, last name)\n\nAddress (street address, city, state, zip/postal code)\n\nPhone numbers (home, work, mobile)\n\nEmail addresses (personal or work)\n\nSocial Security Number (SSN) or equivalent national identification number\n\nDriver‚Äôs license number\n\nPassport number\n\nTax identification number\n\nFinancial account details (bank account number, credit/debit card numbers)\n\nHealth insurance policy number\n\nVehicle registration/license plate number\n\nOnline usernames (when tied to other PII)\n\nBiometric identifiers (fingerprints, facial recognition data, voiceprints, retina scans)\n\nSensitive or Context-Specific PII\n\nDate of birth\n\nPlace of birth\n\nMother‚Äôs maiden name\n\nGender (depending on context)\n\nMarital status\n\nEthnicity or race (in some contexts)\n\nSexual orientation (if revealed with other identifiers)\n\nReligious or political affiliations (if revealed with other identifiers)\n\nMedical records or health information\n\nEmployment details (employer, job title, work history)\n\nEducation records (student ID, transcripts)\n\nOnline and Digital Identifiers\n\nIP address (in some jurisdictions, when linked to other PII)\n\nMAC address (device identifier)\n\nGeolocation data (specific enough to identify a person‚Äôs whereabouts)\n\nCookies or other device IDs (if they can be tied to a person)\n\nSocial media profiles and handles (if tied to other PII)\n\nPhotographs or video footage (where individuals are identifiable)\n\nDerived or Indirect PII\n\nLogin credentials (passwords, PINs, security questions)\n\nPurchase history (if tied to an individual)\n\nMembership or account numbers (gym memberships, loyalty programs)\n\nWorkplace badges or IDs\n\nFacial recognition data from images/videos\n\nPII is generally categorized into sensitive and non-sensitive data. Sensitive PII is any information that, if disclosed, could result in significant harm to the individual.\n\nFor example, if someone‚Äôs credit card information or bank details get stolen, they could face significant financial loss.\n\nNon-sensitive data, if leaked, doesn‚Äôt have as much of an impact. However, when combined with other details, it could have serious consequences.\n\nFor example, a person‚Äôs full name is generally common knowledge. It‚Äôs not really a secret. However, combine that with a social security number and you could have a potential identity theft incident on your hands.\n\nThe Difference Between PII and Personal Data\n\nPersonal information (PI) is any detail linked to an individual, even if it doesn‚Äôt identify them on its own. This includes PII as well as details like their first name, the state in which they live, their favorite color, gender, age range, and even their internet browsing data.\n\nAs you can see, not all PI necessarily gives away the person‚Äôs identity. PII, on the other hand, is information that can be linked to the owner, either by itself or combined with other details.\n\nSo, your first name is your personal information, but on its own, it‚Äôs not really an identifier in a large enough group. Unless you have a very unique first name, there are bound to be other people with that name.\n\nBut what happens if we add your surname into the mix? Suddenly, the information becomes a bit more specific, even though it still might not identify you conclusively. Now, add your home address to this list, and that becomes personally identifiable information.\n\nAs you can see, PII can be made of PI, but not all personal data can definitively identify a person.\n\nIs All PI Potentially PII?\n\nYou might argue that since PII is information that can be combined with other details to reveal a person‚Äôs identity, all personal information is potentially PII. Here‚Äôs why that‚Äôs not true.\n\nLaws like the GDPR and the CCPA are not prescriptive about how many pieces of PI must be combined to make it PII. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs two pieces or more. As long as ‚Äúreasonable effort‚Äù could disclose the identity of the data subject when one or more bits of information were disclosed, those bits count as PII.\n\nThese laws take into account the likelihood of identifying someone with one or more pieces of PI. This can change with context. The smaller the group, the more likely it is for someone to be identified based on generic data.\n\nIt would take much more than ‚Äúreasonable effort‚Äù to pinpoint someone‚Äôs identity based on the fact that they love green, have read Catcher in the Rye more than a dozen times, and are between 30 and 40 years old if the sample set is the population of a country. Even if you were to add in their gender, race, and religion, you still can‚Äôt find out who they are. As such, even though such information is PI, it doesn‚Äôt count as PII.\n\nHowever, if the sample set was people in a department within a business, these details might be enough to identify them. As such, you must take context into account when determining what constitutes PII. That will tell you how well you must protect it.\n\nConsequences of PII Exposure\n\nAs a business, you have a legal and ethical obligation to protect your consumers‚Äô PII. If you don‚Äôt adequately protect their identity, they could face:\n\nIdentity theft\n\nFinancial loss\n\nDamage to their credit score\n\nEmotional distress\n\nAs a responsible business, you would want to protect your patrons from these consequences. If you don‚Äôt, there will be repercussions for you as well.\n\nRegulatory Fines\n\nPII is protected under data privacy laws. If a business fails to protect this information, it could face penalties and fines. For example, the CCPA can impose fines of $2,500 per violation and $7,500 per intentional violation.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note that ‚Äúper violation‚Äù usually means ‚Äúper consumer per incident.‚Äù In certain circumstances, it might even mean each category of PII exposed per individual counts as separate violations.\n\nUnder the CCPA, if 1,000 people were affected, the fine would be $2,500 times 1,000, or $2,500,000, or $7,500,000 in case of intentional violation. If the situation warranted counting each category of PII exposed, and there were three categories, those amounts would be tripled. This fine structure is similar to other state privacy laws, as well.\n\nSimilarly, the GDPR can fine a business up to ‚Ç¨20 million or 4% of its global annual turnover. These aren‚Äôt the only privacy laws, as several US states and other countries are coming up with their own regulations, with hefty fines and penalties for not complying.\n\nLitigation\n\nIn addition to the fines imposed by the regulatory bodies, these regulations also allow the affected parties to take the business to court.\n\nThe CCPA, for example, allows consumers whose personal information has been exposed to file lawsuits if the business doesn‚Äôt make reasonable attempts to mitigate the damage within 30 days. If they win, the business could be asked to pay between $100 and $750 per consumer, or the cost of the actual damages, whichever is greater.\n\nThe GDPR also allows affected consumers to sue a business for damages if it hasn‚Äôt adequately protected their information. One such notable case was when 16,000 claimants filed a group action litigation against British Airways. These consumers were among the 420,000 customers and employees whose personal data was leaked. The airline had to pay ¬£2,000 per claimant on top of the ¬£20 million (reduced from ¬£183 million) in fines.\n\nLoss of Reputation and Consumer Trust\n\nAs a business, you need some personal information from your customers. You might process it internally and use it to develop better offerings or identify other business opportunities. You might even sell or share it with partners to get additional context about your consumers and the market.\n\nIf you do a good job of preserving the privacy rights of your consumers, you will earn their trust. That means they‚Äôll be more likely to share their personal information with you and promote you to the people in their lives.\n\nConversely, if you develop a reputation for failing to uphold the privacy rights of your consumers, they won‚Äôt want to share their personal information, and they‚Äôll discourage others from sharing theirs with you.\n\nPII Compliance Requirements\n\nKeeping your consumers‚Äô PII safe requires more than just the willingness to do the right thing. To help guide you, we‚Äôve created a PII compliance checklist. Following this will get you closer to keeping any PII held by your organization safer.\n\nDiscover, Identify, and Classify PII\n\nIn order to effectively protect your sensitive information, you need to know where all your business data is located, how it‚Äôs stored, processed, and used, and to whom it‚Äôs sent. This‚Äôll help you classify it into restricted, private, and public, which in turn, will help you determine the level of protection it needs.\n\nYou also need to know what jurisdiction your data comes under. If your data subjects are in the European Union (EU), even as visitors, their data would be governed by the GDPR. If they‚Äôre residents of California, you might have to follow the CCPA guidelines.\n\nAn automated privacy data mapping tool could help you gain real-time visibility into your data at rest, data in motion, and data in use, allowing you to understand how data flows in your organization. This knowledge will help you determine what you need to protect, how you should do it, and the proper response if the data is exposed.\n\nCreate a PII Policy\n\nA PII policy is a part of your organization‚Äôs privacy policy. It focuses on the personally identifiable information of consumers, employees, partners, and other stakeholders, and how that is processed, used, shared, and safeguarded.\n\nYour PII policy should elaborate on:\n\nYour organization's data usage policy;\n\nData audit trails;\n\nData breach incident response plan;\n\nData workflows;\n\nData destruction and disposal; and,\n\nData retention.\n\nIf you need help developing a PII policy for your business, you could look to the GDPR. The most well-known and stringent of all data privacy laws, the GDPR offers six principles to keep PII safe. It says that PII processing should be:\n\nLawful, fair, and transparent\n\nFor necessary purposes only\n\nLimited as far as possible\n\nAccurate and timely\n\nCompleted within a defined timeframe\n\nMaintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the data\n\nIn general, your PII-handling practices should follow these principles.\n\nImplement Data Security\n\nData is an important resource, but it resides in and moves through a vast web of connected networks. As such, it faces several threats to its integrity and confidentiality. While it‚Äôs important to have internal processes designed for privacy, you also need security measures to protect your data from external threat actors.\n\nSome security measures protect your PII directly, like encryption and secure storage. Others, like endpoint management and multi-factor authentication, secure access to the devices and systems. Data subject access request (DSAR) and cookie consent management help you reduce the risk of unauthorized data sharing and misuse.\n\nYou could also invest in solutions for governance, risk, and compliance (GRC); data loss prevention (DLP); and security incident and event management (SIEM).\n\nPractice IAM\n\nImplementing identity and access management (IAM) can help you reduce instances where data is made available to those who don‚Äôt need to see it.\n\nWhen your privacy policy isn‚Äôt robust enough to keep consumers‚Äô personal information private, it could lead to inadvertent exposure. This may not even be a data breach. Private data should only be accessible to those who need it or are authorized to see it. This applies to people within your organization as well.\n\nJust because your sales team needs the names and email addresses of consumers doesn‚Äôt mean your technical team should be able to access them as well. Protecting consumer PII isn‚Äôt just keeping it safe from outsiders; you must have a culture of privacy to keep it just as safe from mishandling by people within your organization (whether intentional or unintentional).\n\nIAM deals with internal threats to PII privacy by creating a strictly role-based access routine. It allows you to restrict who can view your organization‚Äôs PII depending on whether they require it for their roles or not.\n\nMonitor and Respond\n\nIn the world of cybersecurity, mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) are important metrics. That‚Äôs because the quicker you detect an incident and respond to mitigate it, the more likely you are to keep it contained and minimize the damage.\n\nThis applies to data privacy as well.\n\nIf you can discover a PII breach early, you can take measures to plug the leak, so to speak. You can also inform the consumers about what‚Äôs been exposed, so they can take action on their end. If it‚Äôs their passwords that have been stolen, the users can be asked to change them. If it‚Äôs leaked financial information, they can lock down their credit.\n\nAssess Regularly\n\nThe data requirements of your business can change over time. So can the regulations governing them. By assessing your PII policy regularly, you‚Äôll identify any potential gaps that you might have missed or new laws that you need to comply with. Similarly, privacy impact assessments (PIA) and data protection impact assessments can help you update your privacy and security measures.\n\nUpdate Your Privacy Policy\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, your PII policy is part of the greater privacy policy, which is a compliance-focused, informational public-facing document. The policy lays out a set of guidelines and business practices your organization uses to keep your data private. It informs readers about:\n\nWhat personal data the business collects\n\nHow this data is used, shared, stored, or processed\n\nThe rights of the data subject concerning that data\n\nThe organization‚Äôs obligations under the relevant data privacy laws\n\nAgain, as with the PII policy, the privacy policy deals with the data of not just the consumers but also employees, partners, and other stakeholders. Keeping this policy updated can help communication with consumers, providing them with clear expectations of how their information will be treated.\n\nA comprehensive privacy policy will help you lay the groundwork for a clear, updated PII policy.\n\nInvest in Data Privacy Management Software\n\nWith a privacy management solution like Osano, you can make compliance a part of your operations.

      "# [Unlock Privacy ROI: Why Making Cross-Functional Allies is Key](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/unlock-privacy-roi-why-making-cross-fun-08757/)\nThough the data privacy function is relatively new, it faces an old challenge: How can privacy prove its value to the business and be seen as more than \"just\" a cost center?\n\nCost centers tend to get the bare minimum in terms of resourcing and influence.

Great Place To Work offers best-in-class data about the employee experience, sourced from surveys taken by millions of employees globally. This data offers organizations invaluable insight into how their workers will interact with the workplace and establishes benchmarks for working conditions around the world.\n\nGreat Place To Work‚Äôs employee-centric view of the workplace was revolutionary 30 years ago.

Using the Great Place To Work Trust Model and the Trust Index Survey, Certification evaluates workplace culture from the perspective that matters the most ‚Äî the employee ‚Äî offering the most comprehensive picture on the market of the internal health of an organization.\n\nTo be considered for Certification, organizations must have 10 or more employees and must complete a two-step process:\n\nSurvey employees with the Trust Index Survey.\n\nComplete the Culture Brief‚Ñ¢, a company questionnaire.\n\nPositive employee responses to the Trust Index Survey (four and above on the five-point scale) are averaged to provide an organization-wide assessment of culture: the Trust Index. Companies that score above the current threshold become Great Place To Work Certified.\n\nSurveys must meet strict requirements for how they are distributed and the percentage of employees who respond to ensure they accurately represent feedback from the company‚Äôs full population.\n\nTo earn Great Place To Work Certification, the average score across your survey results must show that approximately 7 out of 10 of your employees are having a consistently positive experience at work.\n\nOnce you are Certified, you will receive an email from us with access to your survey scores, digital Certification badge, a toolkit of social media images, and press materials with shareable content.

In other words: How often can employees count on something happening in their workplace, such as clear and honest leadership, fair treatment, and employee recognition?\n\nMore specifically, the Great Place To Work Trust Index Survey measures individual employee experiences of five dimensions of a high-trust company culture through 60 statements and two open-ended questions. Three of the dimensions are connected to the actions of leaders and building trust: credibility, respect, and fairness. The other two dimensions measure the workplace experience of employees in relation to their colleagues and the wider organization: pride and a sense of belonging.\n\nThese five dimensions create a workplace culture where employees feel empowered and encouraged to do their most meaningful work. High-trust cultures are shown in Great Place To Work research to outperform their competitors in recruitment and retention, productivity and innovation, and financial performance.\n\nSurvey answers are assessed on a five-point scale, revealing the most common experience of employees in the organization. Employee scores are averaged to provide an organization-wide assessment of workplace culture: the Trust Index score.",
