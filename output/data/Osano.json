      "# [Cookie Consent For GDPR & CCPA Compliance](https://www.osano.com/cookieconsent)\nSimple Cookie Consent 101\n\nCreating a business and its corresponding online presence is a lot of responsibility. It can take a lot of time, research, management, and monitoring to ensure you’re doing your due diligence to protect your customers and your business from allegations of privacy violations. These days, managing cookie consent is the number one task businesses need to worry about when it comes to protecting their customers, obeying the law, and preserving their reputation.\n\nLet’s quickly walk through four of the most frequently asked questions about cookie consent.\n\nWhat Are Cookies?\n\nCookies are small text files stored on a user’s browser that track and collect data such as their name, geographical location, IP address, and more. They can also track which web pages the user visited and how long they spent on the site.\n\nCookies are often used for marketing purposes and enable businesses to gain data on the sort of people their customers are. They’re a great tool for reaching your target market—but it’s important to use them correctly, or you could find yourself on the wrong side of the law.\n\nWhat Is Cookie Consent?\n\nWhen you visit a new website, you might see a banner pop up at the bottom of your screen with a cookie notice to accept or reject cookies or customize the type of cookies you do accept. The act of accepting cookies is cookie consent.\n\nBut it’s more complicated than just that. For instance, there is opt-in consent and opt-out consent. In the former case, you have to actually click “accept” and opt into the use of cookies before they can load on your browser. In the latter case, the banner might inform you that cookies are active and provide a link to stop them from tracking you—you have to opt out in this case.\n\nDifferent laws require different kinds of cookie consent, which we’ll get into later on in the article.\n\nWhat Laws Require Cookie Consent?\n\nIn the EU, the ePrivacy directive (also called the Cookie Law) protects communications online. However, before the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), there were no cookie consent laws in the United States. There still aren’t any laws at the federal level, though several other states now feature regulations to protect data privacy. Most will be familiar with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. Many other countries and regions are also beginning to pass similar laws.\n\nDo I Need a Cookie Policy on my Website?\n\nIf your website uses cookies, the short answer is yes, you need a cookie policy. Even if your business isn’t physically located in a jurisdiction covered by a cookie consent law, you may still receive web traffic from those regions and process the personal data of people protected by such a law. While you can tailor your cookie notices to only appear to residents within a given location, asking for cookie consent from all of your website visitors is a best practice.\n\nCookie Consent Requirements\n\nOne of the requirements under the GDPR (and most other data privacy laws) is that consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. Specifically, this also means that to be compliant, website visitors must opt in before you can drop cookies onto their browser. That’s in contrast to opt-out laws, where cookies can be loaded until the user says otherwise.\n\nMany businesses use an opt-out model when permitted by their governing law since some visitors default to rejecting or exiting cookie banners without indicating their preference. The CPRA is an example of a law that allows businesses to do this.\n\nThe CPRA’s cookie consent requirements are a little different. While the CPRA does not expressly require that a company use opt-in consent, it does require companies to disclose that cookies are being used and what the information gathered will be used for. Under the CPRA and other data privacy laws, data collected by cookies is considered personal information. The CPRA gives California residents the right to request access or deletion of their personal information, including data collected by cookies.\n\nThe basic requirements across the various laws are to first disclose that your website uses cookies, how you use them, and what rights visitors. This can be done with a pop-up notice or a banner at the bottom of the website.\n\nCookie Consent Popups\n\nA cookie consent manager uses banners or popups to collect consent, provide privacy disclosures, and meet other legal requirements. Some consumers have also started using universal preference signals, like the global privacy control, but most users still expect to indicate their consent on a cookie popup. Many laws require you to accept consent through both avenues to be compliant.\n\nAs described previously, opt-in and opt-out cookie consent popups are the two main approaches to cookie consent. There are also notice-only cookie banners, which inform the visitor that the website uses cookies but doesn’t provide any mechanism for opting into or out of their use. The only choices a user has with a notice-only banner is to disable cookies entirely in their browser or leave the website. These banners, however, are increasingly uncommon and are not compliant with most modern data privacy laws.\n\nCookie Consent Examples\n\nNot every website does cookie consent in the same way. As we mentioned, there are three different kinds of consent (opt-in, opt-out, and notice-only), and not all forms of consent align with data privacy laws.\n\nOther regional requirements may also exist. For example, Brazil, Canada, U.S. states, and other jurisdictions all have privacy laws with different requirements for cookie consent. Some tools make it simple for businesses to properly display the appropriate cookie consent banners based on the user’s location—but what do those banners actually look like?\n\nLet’s look at an example from Osano. We use the Osano Consent Management Platform (CMP) to manage cookies on our website. Osano CMP automatically detects where a visitor is located and delivers the corresponding banner, so if a visitor comes from an opt-out jurisdiction, a banner would appear stating that “This website stores data such as cookies to enable essential site functionality, as well as marketing, personalization, and analytics. By remaining on this website, you indicate your consent.” The banner then links to our cookie policy.\n\nOur policy provides clear instructions on how visitors can turn off or customize their cookies, which is accomplished by clicking the Osano Cookie Consent Tool icon in the lower left-hand of the visitors’ screen (if they’re visiting a website that uses Osano to manage consent).\n\nUsers are then presented with toggles to accept or reject marketing, personalization, analytics cookies, and an option to opt out of the sale or share personal information for targeted advertising (not pictured here).\n\nIf a visitor were to come to osano.com from a jurisdiction that is subject to the GDPR, then the banner might look something like this:\n\nNote that each country subject to this data privacy regulation has its own requirements for cookie banners.\n\nTaking a look at cookie consent examples from other businesses may give you an idea of what sort of banner you need to display on your website.\n\nGDPR Cookie Consent\n\nThe Osano cookie banner shown above serves as a good GDPR cookie consent example, the requirements of which dictate that an organization must:\n\nObtain user consent before deploying any cookies except strictly necessary cookies.\n\nInform users how and why the cookies collect data and what they are being used for.\n\nRecord and store cookie consent from users.\n\nAllow users to access the site or service even if they withdraw consent from certain cookies.\n\nCreate a process for removing consent and cookies that makes it as simple as possible.\n\nCookie consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. That is the direct language from the regulation's Article 4.\n\nIt is also common to include a link to your cookie policy that includes greater detail about the cookies your website uses. This is a great place to provide more information about cookie customization and let your users know what they are giving up when they decline unnecessary cookies such as marketing or analytics cookies.\n\nCookie Consent Managers for Cookie Management\n\nA cookie consent manager is a software tool that helps businesses secure cookie consent from website visitors, manage cookies based on the visitor’s consent preferences, and record that consent. Osano serves as an example of this class of solutions—websites running Osano automatically deploy a cookie consent banner that complies with the visitor’s local data privacy law and language preference.\n\nA management tool for cookie consent can be a major asset to a business seeking to remain compliant with ever-changing data privacy laws. There can be hefty fines for noncompliance. For example, Amazon was issued an $877 million fine in 2021 for GDPR violations. Most organizations won’t accrue violations at the same rate as Amazon, but fines can still be an existential threat to a growing business.\n\nRather than use a consent manager, some businesses opt for GDPR cookie consent plugins for WordPress or similar plugins for web tools. The trouble is that these plugins often offer bare-bones compliance. They often provide a one-size-fits-all cookie consent popup that is either excessively strict (causing you to lose out on value business intelligence) or too permissive (leaving you noncompliant in many jurisdictions).\n\nSuch plugins also lack many ancillary benefits that simplify the process. The Osano cookie consent manager, for instance, also provides cookie policy templates that are easy to tailor to your business—other approaches to cookie law compliance force you to develop those policies from scratch.\n\nRather than rely on plugins or subpar solutions, businesses should keep an eye out for solutions that:\n\nDiscover cookies and other data trackers running on your website.\n\nOffer recommended cookie categories (like marketing, personalization, etc.) that users can individually consent to or reject.\n\nAutomatically display the appropriate banner and language to visitors based on their governing laws and language preferences.\n\nFunction without requiring complicated integrations into your tag manager or manual tweaks to your codebase.\n\nMaintain a history of users’ cookie consent preferences to prove you comply with regulations should the need arise.\n\nWhere to Learn More\n\nCookie consent management is a complicated topic, and we can explore only so much in a blog post. There are other questions to answer, like:\n\nHow do you set up a cookie consent program?\n\nWhat is involved in cookie consent? Is it just putting a banner up on your site\n\nWhen should you ask for tracking consent and show the cookie policy?\n\nHow do you update a cookie list for GDPR cookie consent?\n\nWhat happens if you don't use a cookie consent policy on my website?",
      "# [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.osano.com/faq)\nNo, when you first deploy Osano, it is set automatically to a non-breaking, listener only mode. During that time, it only collects data about the scripts and cookies that load on your website.\n\nRead documentation about Consent Management configuration.\n\nOsano does not collect data about your users other than IP addresses, which are stored for 30 days for fraud and abuse detection and then permanently deleted from our log files. In some jurisdictions, IP addresses are considered PII, so we do recommend adding Osano to your GDPR statement as a sub-processor.\n\nWhen you use the Osano GDPR representative service, if you receive any data subject requests or correspondence from an EU supervisory authority, you will receive an email and upon logging in to Osano, you'll have access to your inbox.\n\nAt that point, you can work with our local EU counsel or your own counsel to decide how you would like to respond.\n\nA key component of responding to data subject requests is that they have to be timely, \"without delay and within one month” -- the efficiency of Osano helps reduce the time crunch for requests.\n\nIt entirely depends on the request. Generally, you will want to verify the identity of the individual to ensure they are authorized to make the request.\n\nIn all cases, you will need to quickly find every single record containing any PII that is associated with that individual. This includes data shared with vendors and data stored in your own databases or files.\n\nIf it is a deletion request you need to respond to the subject confirming the deletion. If it is a simple inquiry you will need to provide the list of fields that you have stored about that individual.\n\nEach vendor is measured on a 163 item ontology. Osano attorneys review the published policies for a vendor and map those practices to the ontology.\n\nIn the application, you can see the summary score, but also the breakdown of how that score was calculated.\n\nYes, when you navigate to a vendor's detail page, you can explore all of the subprocessors for each of those vendors. If you believe a subprocessor may be an important 4th party for your own data, follow that subprocessor as an \"indirect\" vendor to be alerted about score changes, lawsuits, and policy changes.\n\nIf you are a vendor in our system and you are concerned about your score, we recommend that you schedule a time with the Experts. The Experts can help you understand where your practices may be substandard.\n\nThe Experts will not share the ontology with you or provide specifics about your individual score.\n\nIn the application in the \"Policy Changes\" section, you will find an ordered list of the changes for each of your vendors. Viewing the policy allows you to compare versions visually.\n\nThe Osano alerts generally include a summary of who the law applies to, the status of the law (enacted or in consideration), and an explanation of what most Osano customers will want to do in response to the law.\n\nWe encourage you to check with your attorney prior to making any decisions.\n\nIn the Osano application, you will be provided with an option to subscribe to regions that you do business in. Those regions can be states, countries, or broad regions such as the EU. Once Osano knows your preferred regions you will begin receiving updates.\n\nIn order to subscribe to a vendor's lawsuit notifications, you must have added that company as a direct or indirect vendor of yours. The number of vendors you can follow and receive alerts for is based on your tier of service.\n\nIn the application, you can access a case summary. Additional documents related to the case are available. Depending on the case and the court in which it was filed, some documents will be free to access while others require a one time purchase to access the documents.\n\nThe experts can provide you with general guidance on practices that may help improve your score, but the experts can not influence the scores, nor do the experts know how the Osano algorithm weighs the items in the ontology.\n\nNo. Osano does not practice law, does not provide legal advice, and does not provide regulatory guidance. Osano provides information about best practices for privacy programs and implementation. All information provided by Osano is the opinion of the company. You should always consult your own legal counsel for final verification of any decisions.\n\nOpen a ticket with support to enable API access if you are on a tier that includes API access.\n\nOnce API access is enabled for your account you will have access to a screen to generate tokens to submit data.\n\nOsano stores in plain text, the fields that you tell us you store about each individual and a one-way encrypted representation of that information. This makes the information searchable but not reversible. What that means is that you can confirm whether you are storing a person's information based on PII (e.g. email, phone, IP address), but you can not reverse engineer the identity of the person from Osano data nor can any individual piece of information be viewed.\n\nYes, you can search the records of consents and PII storage via API. What you receive back is a yes/no flag on whether that information exists in our ledger for your customer account. You also receive which fields were stored about that individual and which vendors the data has been shared with along with timestamps. You can not retrieve PII in Osano because we do not store the PII, only a hash of the PII.\n\nWe hate to see you go, but you can cancel anytime. In the application, follow the easy instructions.

      "# [CCPA Full Text](https://www.osano.com/ccpa)\nCCPA Text\n\nThe section below has the complete, unedited text of the California Consumer Privacy Act. Check out our CCPA Guide if you'd like a description of the law that is easier to read.\n\nAB 375, Title 1.81.5, The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, CCPA\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1.\n\nThis measure shall be known and may be cited as “The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.”\n\nSECTION 2.\n\nThe Legislature finds and declares that:\n\nIn 1972, California voters amended the California Constitution to include the right of privacy among the “inalienable” rights of all people. The amendment established a legal and enforceable right of privacy for every Californian. Fundamental to this right of privacy is the ability of individuals to control the use, including the sale, of their personal information.\n\nSince California voters approved the right of privacy, the California Legislature has adopted specific mechanisms to safeguard Californians’ privacy, including the Online Privacy Protection Act, the Privacy Rights for California Minors in the Digital World Act, and Shine the Light, a California law intended to give Californians the ‘who, what, where, and when’ of how businesses handle consumers’ personal information.\n\nAt the same time, California is one of the world’s leaders in the development of new technologies and related industries. Yet the proliferation of personal information has limited Californians’ ability to properly protect and safeguard their privacy. It is almost impossible to apply for a job, raise a child, drive a car, or make an appointment without sharing personal information.\n\nAs the role of technology and data in the every daily lives of consumers increases, there is an increase in the amount of personal information shared by consumers with businesses. California law has not kept pace with these developments and the personal privacy implications surrounding the collection, use, and protection of personal information.\n\nMany businesses collect personal information from California consumers. They may know where a consumer lives and how many children a consumer has, how fast a consumer drives, a consumer’s personality, sleep habits, biometric and health information, financial information, precise geolocation information, and social networks, to name a few categories.\n\nThe unauthorized disclosure of personal information and the loss of privacy can have devastating effects for individuals, ranging from financial fraud, identity theft, and unnecessary costs to personal time and finances, to destruction of property, harassment, reputational damage, emotional stress, and even potential physical harm.\n\nIn March 2018, it came to light that tens of millions of people had their personal data misused by a data mining firm called Cambridge Analytica. A series of congressional hearings highlighted that our personal information may be vulnerable to misuse when shared on the Internet. As a result, our desire for privacy controls and transparency in data practices is heightened.\n\nPeople desire privacy and more control over their information. California consumers should be able to exercise control over their personal information, and they want to be certain that there are safeguards against misuse of their personal information. It is possible for businesses both to respect consumers’ privacy and provide a high level transparency to their business practices.\n\nTherefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to further Californians’ right to privacy by giving consumers an effective way to control their personal information, by ensuring the following rights\n\n(1) The right of Californians to know what personal information is being collected about them.\n\n(2) The right of Californians to know whether their personal information is sold or disclosed and to whom.\n\n(3) The right of Californians to say no to the sale of personal information.\n\n(4) The right of Californians to access their personal information.\n\n(5) The right of Californians to equal service and price, even if they exercise their privacy rights.\n\nSECTION 3.\n\nTitle 1.81.5 (commencing with Section 1798.100) is added to Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil Code, to read:\n\nTITLE 1.81.5.

historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the businesses’ deletion of the information is likely to render impossible

consumer based on the consumer’s relationship with the business.\n\n(8) Comply with a legal obligation.\n\n(9) Otherwise use the consumer’s personal information, internally, in a lawful manner that is

course of business, that information about the consumer is not retained.\n\n(2) Reidentify or otherwise link any data that, in the ordinary course of business, is not maintained in a manner that would

Information is not “publicly available” if that data is used for a purpose that is not compatible with the purpose for which the data is maintained and made available in the government records or for which it is publicly maintained. “Publicly available” does not include consumer information that is deidentified or aggregate consumer information.\n\n“Probabilistic identifier” means the identification of a consumer or a device to a degree of certainty of more probable than not based on any categories of personal information included in, or similar to, the categories enumerated in the definition of personal information.\n\n“Processing” means any operation or set of operations that are performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means.\n\n“Pseudonymize” or “Pseudonymization” means the processing of personal information in a manner that renders the personal information no longer attributable to a specific consumer without the use of additional information, provided that the additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to an identified or identifiable consumer.\n\n“Research” means scientific, systematic study and observation, including basic research or applied research that is in the public interest and that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws or studies conducted in the public interest in the area of public health.

An intentional interaction occurs when the consumer intends to interact with the third party, via one or more deliberate interactions. Hovering over, muting, pausing, or closing a given piece of content does not constitute a consumer’s intent to interact with a third party.\n\n(B) The business uses or shares an identifier for a consumer who has opted out of the sale of the consumer’s personal information for the purposes of alerting third parties that the consumer has opted out of the sale of the consumer’s personal information.\n\n(C) The business uses or shares with a service provider personal information of a consumer that is necessary to perform a business purposes if both of the following conditions are met: services that the service provider performs on the business’ behalf, provided that the service provider also does not sell the personal information.\n\n(i) The business has provided notice that information being used or shared in its terms and conditions consistent with Section 1798.135.\n\n(ii) The service provider does not further collect, sell, or use the personal information of the consumer except as necessary to perform the business purpose.\n\n(D) The business transfers to a third party the personal information of a consumer as an asset that is part of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other transaction in which the third party assumes control of all or part of the business provided that information is used or shared consistently with Sections 1798.110 and 1798.115. If a third party materially alters how it uses or shares the personal information of a consumer in a manner that is materially inconsistent with the promises made at the time of collection, it shall provide prior notice of the new or changed practice to the consumer. The notice shall be sufficiently prominent and robust to ensure that existing consumers can easily exercise their choices consistently with Section 1798.120. This subparagraph does not authorize a business to make material, retroactive privacy policy changes or make other changes in their privacy policy in a manner that would violate the Unfair and Deceptive Practices Act (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 17200) of Part 2 of Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code).\n\n“Service” or “services” means work, labor, and services, including services furnished in connection with the sale or repair of goods.\n\n“Service provider” means a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, association, or other legal entity that is organized or operated for the profit or financial benefit of its shareholders or other owners, that processes information on behalf of a business and to which the business discloses a consumer’s personal information for a business purpose pursuant to a written contract, provided that the contract prohibits the entity receiving the information from retaining, using, or disclosing the personal information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the services specified in the contract for the business, or as otherwise permitted by this title, including retaining, using, or disclosing the personal information for a commercial purpose other than providing the services specified in the contract with the business.\n\n“Third party” means a person who is not any of the following:\n\n(1) The business that collects personal information from consumers under this title.\n\n(2) A person to whom the business discloses a consumer’s personal information for a business purpose pursuant to a written contract, provided that the contract:\n\n(A) Prohibits the person receiving the personal information from:\n\n(i) Selling the personal information.\n\n(ii) Retaining, using, or disclosing the personal information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the services specified in the contract, including retaining, using, or disclosing the personal information for a commercial purpose other than providing the services specified in the contract.\n\n(iii) Retaining, using, or disclosing the information outside of the direct business relationship between the person and the business.\n\n(B) Includes a certification made by the person receiving the personal information that the person understands the restrictions in subparagraph (A) and will comply with them.\n\nA person covered by paragraph (2) that violates any of the restrictions set forth in this title shall be liable for the violations. A business that discloses personal information to a person covered by paragraph (2) in compliance with paragraph (2) shall not be liable under this title if the person receiving the personal information uses it in violation of the restrictions set forth in this title, provided that, at the time of disclosing the personal information, the business does not have actual knowledge, or reason to believe, that the person intends to commit such a violation.\n\n“Unique identifier” or “Unique personal identifier” means a persistent identifier that can be used to recognize a consumer, a family, or a device that is linked to a consumer or family, over time and across different services, including, but not limited to, a device identifier; an Internet Protocol address; cookies, beacons, pixel tags, mobile ad identifiers, or similar technology; customer number, unique pseudonym, or user alias; telephone numbers, or other forms of persistent or probabilistic identifiers that can be used to identify a particular consumer or device. For purposes of this subdivision, “family” means a custodial parent or guardian and any minor children over which the parent or guardian has custody.\n\n“Verifiable consumer request” means a request that is made by a consumer, by a consumer on behalf of the consumer’s minor child, or by a natural person or a person registered with the Secretary of State, authorized by the consumer to act on the consumer’s behalf, and that the business can reasonably verify, pursuant to regulations adopted by the Attorney General pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 1798.185 to be the consumer about whom the business has collected personal information. A business is not obligated to provide information to the consumer pursuant to Sections 1798.110 and 1798.115 if the business cannot verify, pursuant this subdivision and regulations adopted by the Attorney General pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 1798.185, that the consumer making the request is the consumer about whom the business has collected information or is a person authorized by the consumer to act on such consumer’s behalf.\n\n1798.145.\n\nThe obligations imposed on businesses by this title shall not restrict a business’s ability to:\n\n(1) Comply with federal, state, or local laws.\n\n(2) Comply with a civil, criminal, or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena, or summons by federal, state, or local authorities.\n\n(3) Cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the business, service provider, or third party reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state, or local law.\n\n(4) Exercise or defend legal claims.\n\n(5) Collect, use, retain, sell, or disclose consumer information that is deidentified or in the aggregate consumer information.\n\n(6) Collect or sell a consumer’s personal information if every aspect of that commercial conduct takes place wholly outside of California. For purposes of this title, commercial conduct takes place wholly outside of California if the business collected that information while the consumer was outside of California, no part of the sale of the consumer’s personal information occurred in California, and no personal information collected while the consumer was in California is sold. This paragraph shall not permit a business from storing, including on a device, personal information about a consumer when the consumer is in California and then collecting that personal information when the consumer and stored personal information is outside of California.\n\nThe obligations imposed on businesses by Sections 1798.110 to 1798.135, inclusive, shall not apply where compliance by the business with the title would violate an evidentiary privilege under California law and shall not prevent a business from providing the personal information of a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under California law as part of a privileged communication.\n\nThis act shall not apply to protected or health information that is collected by a covered entity governed by the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (Part 2.6 (commencing with Section 56 of Division 1)) or governed by the privacy, security, and breach notification rules issued by the federal Department of Health and Human Services, Parts 160 and 164 of Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations, established pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Availability Act of 1996. For purposes of this subdivision, the definition of “medical information” in Section 56.05 shall apply and the definitions of “protected health information” and “covered entity” from the federal privacy rule shall apply.\n\nThis title shall not apply to the sale of personal information to or from a consumer reporting agency if that information is to be reported in, or used to generate, a consumer report as defined by subdivision (d) of Section 1681a of Title 15 of the United States Code, and use of that information is limited by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681 et seq.).\n\nThis title shall not apply to personal information collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Public Law 106-102), and implementing regulations, if it is in conflict with that law.\n\nThis title shall not apply to personal information collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994 (18 U.S.C. Sec. 2721 et seq.), if it is in conflict with that act.\n\nNotwithstanding a business’ obligations to respond to and honor consumer rights requests pursuant to this title:\n\n(1) A time period for a business to respond to any verified consumer request may be extended by up to 90 additional days where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. The business shall inform the consumer of any such extension within 45 days of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay.\n\n(2) If the business does not take action on the request of the consumer, the business shall inform the consumer, without delay and at the latest within the time period permitted of response by this section, of the reasons for not taking action and any rights the consumer may have to appeal the decision to the business.\n\n(3) If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, a business may either charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested, or refuse to act on the request and notify the consumer of the reason for refusing the request. The business shall bear the burden of demonstrating that any verified consumer request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\n\nA business that discloses personal information to a service provider shall not be liable under this title if the service provider receiving the personal information uses it in violation of the restrictions set forth in the title, provided that, at the time of disclosing the personal information, the business does not have actual knowledge, or reason to believe, that the service provider intends to commit such a violation. A service provider shall likewise not be liable under this title for the obligations of a business for which it provides services as set forth in this title.\n\n(i) This title shall not be construed to require a business to reidentify or otherwise link information that is not maintained in a manner that would be considered personal information.\n\n(j) The rights afforded to consumers and the obligations imposed on the business in this title shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other consumers.\n\n1798.150.\n\n(1) Any consumer whose nonencrypted or nonredacted personal information, as defined in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) of Section 1798.81.5, is subject to an unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft, or disclosure as a result of the business’ violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information to protect the personal information may institute a civil action for any of the following:\n\n(A) To recover damages in an amount not less than one hundred dollars ($100) and not greater than seven hundred and fifty ($750) per consumer per incident or actual damages, whichever is greater.\n\n(B) Injunctive or declaratory relief.\n\n(C) Any other relief the court deems proper.\n\n(2) In assessing the amount of statutory damages, the court shall consider any one or more of the relevant circumstances presented by any of the parties to the case, including, but not limited to, the nature and seriousness of the misconduct, the number of violations, the persistence of the misconduct, the length of time over which the misconduct occurred, the willfulness of the defendant’s misconduct, and the defendant’s assets, liabilities, and net worth.\n\nActions pursuant to this section may be brought by a consumer if all of the following requirements are met:\n\n(1) Prior to initiating any action against a business for statutory damages on an individual or class-wide basis, a consumer shall provide a business 30 days’ written notice identifying the specific provisions of this title the consumer alleges have been or are being violated. In the event a cure is possible, if within the 30 days the business actually cures the noticed violation and provides the consumer an express written statement that the violations have been cured and that no further violations shall occur, no action for individual statutory damages or class-wide statutory damages may be initiated against the business. No notice shall be required prior to an individual consumer initiating an action solely for actual pecuniary damages suffered as a result of the alleged violations of this title. If a business continues to violate this title in breach of the express written statement provided to the consumer under this section, the consumer may initiate an action against the business to enforce the written statement and may pursue statutory damages for each breach of the express written statement, as well as any other violation of the title that postdates the written statement.\n\n(2) A consumer bringing an action as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) shall notify the Attorney General within 30 days that the action has been filed.\n\n(3) The Attorney General, upon receiving such notice shall, within 30 days, do one of the following:\n\n(A) Notify the consumer bringing the action of the Attorney General’s intent to prosecute an action against the violation. If the Attorney General does not prosecute within six months, the consumer may proceed with the action.\n\n(B) Refrain from acting within the 30 days, allowing the consumer bringing the action to proceed.\n\n(C) Notify the consumer bringing the action that the consumer shall not proceed with the action.\n\nNothing in this act shall be interpreted to serve as the basis for a private right of action under any other law. This shall not be construed to relieve any party from any duties or obligations imposed under other law or the United States or California Constitution.\n\n1798.155.\n\nAny business or third party may seek the opinion of the Attorney General for guidance on how to comply with the provisions of this title.\n\nA business shall be in violation of this title if it fails to cure any alleged violation within 30 days after being notified of alleged noncompliance. Any business, service provider, or other person that violates this title shall be liable for a civil penalty as provided in Section 17206 of the Business and Professions Code in a civil action brought in the name of the people of the State of California by the Attorney General. The civil penalties provided for in this section shall be exclusively assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the people of the State of California by the Attorney General.\n\nNotwithstanding Section 17206 of the Business and Professions Code, any person, business, or service provider that intentionally violates this title may be liable for a civil penalty of up to seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) for each violation.\n\nNotwithstanding Section 17206 of the Business and Professions Code, any civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 17206 for a violation of this title, and the proceeds of any settlement of an action brought pursuant to subdivision (a), shall be allocated as follows:\n\n(1) Twenty percent to the Consumer Privacy Fund, created within the General Fund pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1798.109, with the intent to fully offset any costs incurred by the state courts and the Attorney General in connection with this title.\n\n(2) Eighty percent to the jurisdiction on whose behalf the action leading to the civil penalty was brought.\n\nIt is the intent of the Legislature that the percentages specified in subdivision (c) be adjusted as necessary to ensure that any civil penalties assessed for a violation of this title fully offset any costs incurred by the state courts and the Attorney General in connection with this title, including a sufficient amount to cover any deficit from a prior fiscal year.\n\n1798.160.\n\nA special fund to be known as the “Consumer Privacy Fund” is hereby created within the General Fund in the State Treasury, and is available upon appropriation by the Legislature to offset any costs incurred by the state courts in connection with actions brought to enforce this title and any costs incurred by the Attorney General in carrying out the Attorney General’s duties under this title.\n\nFunds transferred to the Consumer Privacy Fund shall be used exclusively to offset any costs incurred by the state courts and the Attorney General in connection with this title. These funds shall not be subject to appropriation or transfer by the Legislature for any other purpose, unless the Director of Finance determines that the funds are in excess of the funding needed to fully offset the costs incurred by the state courts and the Attorney General in connection with this title, in which case the Legislature may appropriate excess funds for other purposes.\n\n1798.175.\n\nThis title is intended to further the constitutional right of privacy and to supplement existing laws relating to consumers’ personal information, including, but not limited to, Chapter 22 (commencing with Section 22575) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code and Title 1.81 (commencing with Section 1798.80). The provisions of this title are not limited to information collected electronically or over the Internet, but apply to the collection and sale of all personal information collected by a business from consumers. Wherever possible, law relating to consumers’ personal information should be construed to harmonize with the provisions of this title, but in the event of a conflict between other laws and the provisions of this title, the provisions of the law that afford the greatest protection for the right of privacy for consumers shall control.\n\n1798.180.\n\nThis title is a matter of statewide concern and supersedes and preempts all rules, regulations, codes, ordinances, and other laws adopted by a city, county, city and county, municipality, or local agency regarding the collection and sale of consumers’ personal information by a business.\n\n1798.185.\n\nOn or before January 1, 2020, the Attorney General shall solicit broad public participation to adopt regulations to further the purposes of this title, including, but not limited to, the following areas:\n\n(1) Updating as needed additional categories of personal information to those enumerated in subdivision (c) of Section 1798.130 and subdivision (o) of Section 1798.140 in order to address changes in technology, data collection practices, obstacles to implementation, and privacy concerns.\n\n(2) Updating as needed the definition of unique identifiers to address changes in technology, data collection, obstacles to implementation, and privacy concerns, and additional categories to the definition of designated methods for submitting requests to facilitate a consumer’s ability to obtain information from a business pursuant to Section 1798.130.\n\n(3) Establishing any exceptions necessary to comply with state or federal law, including, but not limited to, those relating to trade secrets and intellectual property rights, within one year of passage of this title and as needed thereafter.\n\n(4) Establishing rules and procedures for the following, within one year of passage of this title and as needed thereafter:\n\n(A) To facilitate and govern the submission of a request by a consumer to opt out of the sale of personal information pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 1798.145.\n\n(B) To govern business compliance with a consumer’s opt-out request.\n\n(C) The development and use of a recognizable and uniform opt-out logo or button by all businesses to promote consumer awareness of the opportunity to opt out of the sale of personal information.\n\n(5) Adjusting the monetary threshold in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 1798.106 in January of every odd-numbered year to reflect any increase in the Consumer Price Index.\n\n(6) Establishing rules, procedures, and any exceptions necessary to ensure that the notices and information that businesses are required to provide pursuant to this title are provided in a manner that may be easily understood by the average consumer, are accessible to consumers with disabilities, and are available in the language primarily used to interact with the consumer, including establishing rules and guidelines regarding financial incentive offerings, within one year of passage of this title and as needed thereafter.\n\n(7) Establishing rules and procedures to further the purposes of Sections 1798.110 and 1798.115 and to facilitate a consumer’s or the consumer’s authorized agent’s ability to obtain information pursuant to Section 1798.130, with the goal of minimizing the administrative burden on consumers, taking into account available technology, security concerns, and the burden on the business, to govern a business’ determination that a request for information received by a consumer is a verifiable request, including treating a request submitted through a password-protected account maintained by the consumer with the business while the consumer is logged into the account as a verifiable request and providing a mechanism for a consumer who does not maintain an account with the business to request information through the business’ authentication of the consumer’s identity, within one year of passage of this title and as needed thereafter.\n\nThe Attorney General may adopt additional regulations as necessary to further the purposes of this title.\n\n1798.190.\n\nIf a series of steps or transactions were component parts of a single transaction intended from the beginning to be taken with the intention of avoiding the reach of this title, including the disclosure of information by a business to a third party in order to avoid the definition of sell, a court shall disregard the intermediate steps or transactions for purposes of effectuating the purposes of this title.\n\n1798.192.\n\nAny provision of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive or limit in any way a consumer’s rights under this title, including, but not limited to, any right to a remedy or means of enforcement, shall be deemed contrary to public policy and shall be void and unenforceable. This section shall not prevent a consumer from declining to request information from a business, declining to opt out of a business’ sale of the consumer’s personal information, or authorizing a business to sell the consumer’s personal information after previously opting out.\n\n1798.194.\n\nThis title shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.\n\n1798.196.\n\nThis title is intended to supplement federal and state law, if permissible, but shall not apply if such application is preempted by, or in conflict with, federal law or the California Constitution.\n\n1798.198.\n\nSubject to limitation provided in subdivision (b), this title shall be operative January 1, 2020.\n\n(b) This act shall become operative only if initiative measure No. 17-0039, The Consumer Right to Privacy Act of 2018, is withdrawn from the ballot pursuant to Section 9604 of the Elections Code.\n\nSECTION 4.",

      "# [The Ultimate Guide to the GDPR](https://www.osano.com/gdpr)\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is the GDPR?\n\nWhen did the GDPR go into effect?\n\nGDPR requirements, scope, and definitions\n\nGDPR terms and concepts you must understand\n\nWhat are data subject rights under the GDPR?\n\nWhat is the consideration for data deletion under the GDPR?\n\nHow do I comply with the seven principles of the GDPR?\n\nWhat are the requirements for processing personal data under the GDPR?\n\nWhat is the definition of \"consent\" under the GDPR?\n\nWhat are the rules on children's data under the GDPR?\n\nHow does the GDPR affect marketing?\n\nWhat are cookies under the GDPR?\n\nWho enforces the GDPR?\n\nWhat are the punishments for violating the GDPR?\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWhat is the GDPR?\n\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation changed the world of privacy law. It obligated companies to make sweeping changes to their data protection and privacy practices to comply or face potentially massive fines.\n\nIt was technically \"adopted\" in 2016, but lawmakers gave organizations a two-year grace period to revamp whatever policies necessary to come into compliance. It finally went into effect in May 2018.\n\nEurope has always been ahead of the game on data protection. Its laws date back 70 years. Before the GDPR, the European Convention on Human Rights of 1950 granted European's a right to privacy. The Convention served as the impetus for codifying the right to privacy into law.\n\nBefore the GDPR, the EU Data Protection Directive regulated data privacy. But it became effective in 1995, long before companies were collecting data at the scale they are now, and long before digital commerce created end-user data trails that advertisers could track across the web.\n\nBut by 2012, the European Parliament realized that the Directive wasn't enough. Websites were vacuuming up user data at an unprecedented rate, and the existing hodgepodge of privacy laws across the (then-28) member states was confusing and insufficient. They decided to draft a regulation, the strongest form of legal enforcement in the EU.\n\nIt comes down to this: If your organization collects, uses, or stores EU citizens' personal data, regardless of where it's processed, you're covered by this law.\n\nWhen did the GDPR go into effect?\n\nThe GDPR went into effect on May 25, 2018. Regulators gave organizations a two-year grace period before enforcement began.\n\nGDPR requirements, scope, and definitions\n\nThough the GDPR is an EU-based law, it doesn't apply to only EU companies. It has what's called extraterritorial reach. That means that even if a company doesn't operate within the EU -- say it's U.S.-based -- but has customers in the EU, it must comply with the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR required EU member states to pass national laws that closely mapped to the GDPR's provisions.\n\nThe GDPR aims to give individuals — which the legislation calls \"data subjects\" — privacy protections but also allow businesses relying on data to survive or thrive. To strike this balance, the GDPR introduced new concepts for protecting data. Those include:\n\nExpanded definitions for \"personal data\" and \"sensitive data.\"\n\nData protection by design principles for technology and operations.\n\nAccountability measures.\n\nExpanded data subject rights, including the right to be forgotten and to object to automated data processing.\n\nProvisions on data breach notification.\n\nIn addition, companies' partners are on the hook. If you process data on behalf of a company with EU citizens, you must comply with the GDPR.\n\nGDPR terms and concepts you must understand\n\nUnderstanding the GDPR requires working definitions of the vocabulary it uses. Here is a list of some of the most important terms.\n\nPersonal Data: Any information that can directly or indirectly identify an individual. This includes names, email addresses, ethnicity, zip code or other location information, gender, banking details, IP addresses, biometric data, religious and political beliefs, web cookies and even social media posts.\n\nData Processing: Any action performed on data, including manual and automatic methods.\n\nData Controllers: The person who decides why, when and how personal data is processed.\n\nData Subject: A person whose data is processed. Think customers, subscribers.\n\nData Processor: Any third-party organization that engages in processing personal data, including email marketing tools, analytics tools, and cloud vendors.\n\nAccountability: Organizations must put technical and organizational measures in place to demonstrate what they did with data and why it was necessary.\n\nTransparency: Organizations must communicate to data subjects about data processing in a way that's \"easily accessible and easy to understand\" and uses \"clear and plain language.\"\n\nPrivacy by Design: Data protection through technology design.\n\nWhat are data subject rights under the GDPR?\n\nThe GDPR grants specific rights to data subjects to increase transparency and give them control over their data and how it's used. It's essential to know these data rights so you can responsibly comply when they want to exercise their privacy rights.\n\nThey are:\n\nThe right to be informed that you've collected and used personal data. If you collected it from the subject yourself, you have to notify the data subject at the time of collection. Suppose you're a third-party vendor, for example, and obtained the data secondarily. In that case, the data subject must be informed within a \"reasonable period of time,\" no later than 30 days, and in an easily accessible form.\n\nThe right to access personal data and how it's processed. A data subject can ask for a copy of all the data being processed about them. It's called a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR). It's essential to have a mechanism to intake DSARs because a data subject can request a copy of the data, an overview of the categories of data you're processing, why you're doing so, and any parties with whom you're sharing the data.\n\nThe right to rectify inaccurate or incomplete personal data. If an individual requests rectification (verbally or in writing), you have one month to comply. If the request is \"excessive or \"manifestly unfounded,\" you can refuse.\n\nThe right to erase data. Under this rule, a data subject has the right to request that you erase their personal data within 30 days. Certain conditions must exist for the request to be legitimate, of course. These include: if the data is no longer relevant, the original purpose for collection has been satisfied, or if a data subject withdraws consent. If any of those apply, you have to stop processing their data and further disseminating that data.\n\nThe right to restrict the processing of personal data. If a data subject requests this, you have to stop processing their data, but you can still store it. Requests can be made verbally or in writing, and you have 30 days to respond.\n\nThe right to data portability. Data subjects must be allowed to take their data from one platform to another and do so easily, safely, and securely. Data controllers must allow it without disrupting its useability. You must provide data subjects with the entirety of their data in a standard, machine-readable format.\n\nThe right to object. Data subjects can object to how their information is used for marketing, sales or non-service-related purposes. An organization must inform individuals of their right to object within the first communication. Organizations must examine each objection, but it can refuse to validate the objection if one of the following is true:\n\nLegal or official authority is being carried out.\n\nThe organization has a \"legitimate interest\" to process data to provide a data subject with a service they signed up for.\n\nA task is being carried out for public benefit.\n\nAn organization can also refuse a request if the objection request is \"excessive\" or \"manifestly unfounded.\"\n\nAutomated decision-making and profiling. Data subjects have the right to say no to solely automated decisions — including profiling — being made about their data that could have a legal or similarly significant effect on them. For instance, a website that automatically approves or denies people loans or makes hiring decisions would have a \"significant effect\" on their lives. Data subjects can opt-out of these practices.\n\nWhat is the consideration for data deletion under the GDPR?\n\nAs mentioned in the above section, data subjects have the right to request that organizations delete personal data about them \"without undue delay.\" The requirements that must apply for a deletion request to be valid are:\n\nThe data isn't needed anymore for the purpose it was collected or processed.\n\nThe data subject is withdrawing consent for the processing, and there is no other legal ground for the processing.\n\nThe data subject objects to the processing, and there are no other legitimate grounds for the processing\n\nThe personal data was unlawfully processed in the first place.\n\nThe personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation.\n\nData subjects can't request deletion if the data is a matter of freedom of expression or information, if the processing is a matter of public health, or if the data is archived for scientific or historical research purposes.\n\nHow do I comply with the seven principles of the GDPR?\n\nThe GDPR comprises seven principles with which organizations must comply. They are as follows:\n\nLawfulness, fairness, and transparency: Processing data should abide by the law, treat data subjects fairly and be transparent.\n\nPurpose limitation: Companies should only process data for legitimate purposes that you specify for each data subject before you collect it.\n\nData minimization: Data processors must collect and use only the data absolutely necessary to complete their business and limit access to personal data to only those employees needing the information to complete the process consented to by the data subject.\n\nAccuracy: Organizations should keep their data accurate at all times.\n\nStorage limitation: Organizations should only store personal data as long as necessary for the intended purpose. Organizations should delete the data when they're done with it.\n\nIntegrity and confidentiality: Organizations should process data to protect its security, integrity, and privacy. (For instance, transferring data with encryption).\n\nAccountability: Organizations are responsible for demonstrating GDPR compliance. Regulators expect detailed documentation about the data collected, how it's used, and where it's stored. Organizations must train staff well to implement organizational security measures. And organizations must have data processing agreements in place with all third-party vendors who process data on their behalf.\n\nWhat are the requirements for processing personal data under the GDPR?\n\nThe GDPR mandates that organizations only collect, store, process or sell data under one of the following lawful bases apply:\n\nThe data subject gave specific consent to process the data.\n\nThe processing is necessary to enter into a contract with the data subject.\n\nYou need to comply with a legal obligation, like a court order.\n\nThe processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or someone else. Meaning, processing the data could save a life.\n\nThe processing is necessary to carry out a task of public interest.\n\nLegitimate interest: You're using the data in a way the data subject would expect given the service or product you're offering.\n\nWhat is the definition of \"consent\" under the GDPR?\n\nTo legally process data, the reason for doing so must fall under one of the GDPR's six legal bases, as listed above. Consent is one of them, and it's one of the most significant changes the GDPR ushered in, requiring organizations to acquire permission, explicitly, from any data subject before collecting their data. Not only must organizations gain consent, but they must use language that's easy to understand when asking the data subject for it.\n\nThe GDPR says a data subject consent means: \"any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by [them], by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.\"\n\nSo, if you're processing based on consent, you must:\n\nDemonstrate the data subject granted consent to processing their data.\n\nEnsure the request for consent was in clear and plain language and in an easily accessible form.\n\nEnsure the data subject has the right to revoke consent at any time\n\nIf the data subject doesn't grant consent, you must still allow them the same experience and access to your site as the data subjects who consented.\n\nWhat are the rules on children's data under the GDPR?\n\nIf you seek to process children's data, you may never ask a person age 13 or under to give you consent. If you're asking for consent for children ages 13-15, you must also ask their parent or guardian. Children age 16 and up may give consent for themselves.\n\nHow does the GDPR affect marketing?\n\nThe GDPR grants specific rights to data subjects to increase transparency and give them control over their data and how it's used. In marketing, of course, the more you know about a customer, the better the sales. Determining insights about consumer interests and preferences is key to delivering relevant ads and offers. That can put the marketing tactics of younger days in conflict with the GDPR's rules. It's essential to check your practices against some of the data rights mentioned in our earlier section so you can be sure you're collecting data legally and to enable you to comply if a data subject wants to exercise their privacy rights.\n\nThe most important aspect of the GDPR to marketers are its data collection provisions, profiling data subjects, and targeted ads. The GDPR requires organizations to be transparent with data subjects about how their data will be used.\n\nYou must notify customers at your first interaction that you're collecting their data. And remember, if you're a third-party vendor, you must inform the data subject within 30 days in an easy-to-read format.\n\nData discovery\n\nIt's essential to determine where your data lives in order to comply with data subject's rights under the GDPR. This is called data discovery or data mapping. That will allow you to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal data if a data subject requests you do so, and you will be able to respond to data subject access requests (DSARs) promptly. DSARs, as mentioned above, allow the data subject to request a copy of all the data you've collected on them. It can be complicated to find, categorize, and report back if you don't know where the information lives across the organization.\n\nIt's also essential to check your records to ensure you've asked the data subjects for explicit opt-in consent to process their data (no pre-ticked checkboxes!), and you've only used the data for the purpose it was collected.\n\nIf the data subject said you could collect their data to process a bill, it's not appropriate to automatically add that information onto a mailing list.\n\nIn addition, you must ensure you've given data subjects the ability to opt out of targeted advertising. And that brings us to the conversation about cookies.\n\nWhat are cookies under the GDPR?\n\nMarketers depend on cookies — small text files that store data— to follow users around the web to glean insights on users' preferences and locations, among other details. Under the GDPR, cookies can be considered personal data. If a cookie can identify a person based on their device, that's deemed personal data. Cookies considered personal data under the GDPR can include \"a name, an identification number, location data or an online identifier.\" A special mention should be made for biometric data, such as fingerprints, which can also work as identifiers. These get a bit tricky. For help on this, the GDPR provides several examples of online identifiers in Recital 30. They include:\n\nInternet protocol (IP) addresses.\n\nRadio frequency identification (RFID) tags.\n\nIt's essential to look at the types of cookies your organization is deploying. If they're \"strictly necessary\" cookies, meaning they're required for the site to function, consent is not required. Otherwise, it is. Be sure to collect consent for marketing cookies, record that consent and allow it easy for data subjects to revoke consent as it was for them to say yes.\n\nWho enforces the GDPR?\n\nIndividual data protection authorities (DPAs) from the 27 EU member states enforce the GDPR. DPAs are independent of the government. They investigate complaints, provide advice on data protection issues and determine when the GDPR has been breached. They also have fining powers.\n\nDPAs are independent public authorities that supervise the application of the data protection law through investigative and corrective powers. They provide expert advice on data protection issues and handle complaints lodged against the General Data Protection Regulation violations and the relevant national laws.\n\nAll DPAs work together as a group on the European Data Protection Board. The European Data Protection Supervisor leads the board. The EDPB aims to harmonize GDPR enforcement across the EU. The board is responsible for guiding member states on complicated topics or the application of the law. It also issues opinions to the European Commission when it considers data protection and privacy legislation or issues.\n\nThe EDPB does not, however, enforce data protection law.\n\nWhat are the punishments for violating the GDPR?\n\nThe cost of noncompliance with the GDPR can be high. Organizations that violate the law can be fined up to 4% of annual global revenue or 20 million euros, whichever is greater.\n\nYou've probably seen some of the media headlines reporting on DPAs taking action against various companies for GDPR violations. Some of the more hefty fines include:\n\nThe Irish DPA's $267 million fine against WhatsApp in September 2021.\n\nThe Luxembourg DPA's $887 fine against Amazon in July 2021.\n\nThe French DPA's $593 million fine against Google in July 2021.\n\nWhile it's often the big technology firms that have faced the most significant fines thus far, reading the enforcement actions will give you an indication of how the DPAs are thinking and in which areas they're most strict on enforcing.\n\nWhile the GDPR is a massive piece of legislation and can be challenging to interpret, it serves as the basis for many international laws that have passed since its inception, so it's a vital regulation to understand. For example, the terms may change from the GDPR to Brazil's privacy law, but the concepts are the same. The trend is toward increased data subject rights, transparency, and accountability.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWhere can I find the full GDPR text?\n\nYou can find the full text on our site here.\n\nHow many different articles are there in the GDPR? Where can I find them?\n\nAs of this writing, there are 99 articles in the GDPR, separated into 11 separate chapters (even subsections). You can find their full text here.\n\nWhat do I need to do to comply with the GDPR?\n\nTo start, as mentioned above, there are 7 different principles that guide the GDPR. Following these principles are a start to help you stay compliant with the law, but it's a little more complicated than simply \"minimizing data.\" You'll also need to bring on a Data Protection Officer, limit access to personal data to only the employees who need it, and implement Privacy by Design into your organization's processes. Learn more here.\n\nWhat are the most important components of the GDPR that I should know?\n\nThere's a lot to unpack in any data privacy law, but we highly recommend you understand the 8 rights data subjects are afforded by the GDPR, how the GDPR applies to you (even if you're not in the EU), whether you need a GDPR representative, the penalties associated with GDPR violations, the importance of opting in, and more. Learn about them here.\n\nWhat is a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR)?\n\nA data subject access request (DSAR) is a type of request made by a consumer or customer (or employee, depending on the law) to an organization, exercising their rights over the personal information the organization has collected on them. The request could be to see the data the organization has, that the data is deleted, changed, made anonymous, and more. Learn about DSARs in our article here.\n\nWhat does data minimization even mean?\n\nAccording to our article on the data minimization principle, \"Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR defines data minimization by saying that personal data should be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.” In other words, businesses should only collect essential information and only keep it as long as it’s actually needed.\"\n\nWhat are data protection impact assessments (DPIAs)?\n\nData protection impact assessments, or DPIAs, are audits meant to assess risk when it comes to data processing. They're a key component to the data minimization principle, though who must perform one and when can be a little confusing. Learn more about whether you need to perform one here.\n\nWhat is a record of processing activities (RoPA)?\n\nArticle 30 of the GDPR requires organizations to keep a record of how they process data, referred to commonly as a RoPA. That's great, but you might have even more questions now, such as \"Who has to keep track of it?\" \"What information needs to be in the RoPA?\" \"Who needs to see the record?\" Find answers to the rest of these questions in our blog detailing out records of processing activities here.",

      "# [What Is the ADPPA (American Data Privacy and Protection Act)? by Matt Davis, CIPM (IAPP) on 2022-08-05](https://www.osano.com/articles/adppa)\nLooking for information on the more recent American Privacy Rights Act? You can find a summary here.\n\nWill the US soon see a federal data privacy bill? Something that equals or surpasses the GDPR?\n\nWhat Is the American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA)?\n\nWhen it was introduced in 2022, the American Data Privacy Protection Act (ADPPA) made it further along the federal legislative process than any other data privacy regulation in the US. Although the ADPPA passed out of committee with a bipartisan 53-2 vote, it failed to advance to the House or Senate floors in the last Congress—but that doesn't mean businesses and privacy professionals should write the ADPPA off.\n\nOn March 1st, 2023, the Innovation, Data, and Commerce Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing primarily focused on the ADPPA. The bill has yet to be reintroduced in Congress, but the hearing signaled that the ADPPA still enjoys significant support. If there is to be a federal data privacy bill in the U.S., it seems like it'll either come in the form of the ADPPA or in a bill that closely resembles it.\n\nTo get prepared for the possibility that it becomes law, we’ll dive into the ADPPA’s notable features, current amendments, criticisms, next steps, and overall chances in the House and Senate.\n\nWhat’s in the ADPPA Bill Currently?\n\nThe ADPPA features many of the same components as other modern data privacy laws, like the CPRA. (For an overview of the fundamental components of a modern data privacy law, see our blog, \"The anatomy of a data privacy law\"). Naturally, the bill varies in some of its details, and some of those variations could have a big impact on businesses should the ADPPA be enacted into law. Let’s take a look at some of the bill’s notable features and the amendments that have been made to date.\n\nNotable Features of the ADPPA\n\nVariations in Definitions\n\nThe ADPPA refers to businesses and data in different terms and with a different scope than other data privacy laws. The major differences include:\n\n“Covered entities,” which are defined as any entity or person that collects, processes, or transfers data and is subject to the Federal Trade Commission Act, is a common carrier under the Communications Act, or is a non-profit. This definition covers the vast majority of businesses.\n\n“Covered data,” which includes any information that identifies, is linked, or is reasonably linkable to an individual or a device. It also includes any data or unique identifiers derived from such information, like IP addresses, targeted advertising identifiers, and the like.\n\n“Children,” which are defined as any person under the age of 17. This is significant as data privacy laws often require businesses to treat children’s data in certain ways. Most other data privacy laws define children as people under the age of 13 or 16.\n\n“Sensitive data,” which includes categories of data beyond what other state privacy laws consider sensitive. Most laws consider info like race, ethnicity, genetic data, children’s data, and the like to be sensitive; California also includes union membership and identifiers like social security numbers; the ADPPA includes all of that as well as login credentials for any device. There are other minor deviations as well, but it is beyond the scope of this article to list each.\n\nPreemption\n\nIf the ADPPA is signed into law, it will preempt all other state data privacy laws. So, a business that is currently subject to Connecticut’s CTDPA, for instance, would instead need to be in compliance with the ADPPA.\n\nPreemption is a big sticking point in the bill. Many states — especially California — don’t want their own laws to be superseded by the ADPPA.\n\nThe ADPPA does make several exceptions to its preemption, however. More specific laws governing data privacy, like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) would still apply, as well as certain elements of California’s CPRA (more on that later.)\n\nPrivate Right of Action\n\nA private right of action refers to the ability of individuals to sue businesses for noncompliance. Most US data privacy laws do not feature a private right of action, but the ADPPA does.\n\nPrior to suing, however, an individual would need to inform the FTC or their state attorney general. Then, the FTC and/or state attorney general have 60 days to decide whether to intervene in the lawsuit. Additionally, the individual has to let the business know they intend to sue, and they have to give the business 45 days to correct the violation prior to contacting the FTC/attorney general.\n\nSpecial Category for Large Data Holders\n\nThe ADPPA treats businesses that handle significant amounts of data differently than others. To qualify as a large data holder, a business must:\n\nMake more than $250 million in gross annual revenue and\n\nProcess the data of more than 5 million individuals or\n\nProcess the sensitive data of 200,000 individuals annually.\n\nThese are your Facebooks and Googles of the world. Under the ADPPA, they would have all sorts of additional disclosure, certification, and audit requirements.\n\nSpecial Category for Small Businesses\n\nThe ADPPA defines small businesses as those that:\n\nAre not data brokers,\n\nHave less than $41 million in gross annual revenue, and\n\nProcess the data of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually.\n\nMost notably, it has no lower threshold — other state privacy laws generally don’t restrict businesses that process fewer than 100,000 individuals’ data. Thus, nearly every kind of business is subject to the ADPPA in one way or another. And while there are some exceptions as to what applies to small businesses under the ADPPA, most of its requirements still hold.\n\nRight to Opt-out of Data Transfer\n\nLike other state data privacy laws, the ADPPA gives consumers a variety of rights. An additional right that only it and the CPRA provide is the right for consumers to opt out of having their data transferred to third parties. Other state laws allow individuals to opt out of the sale of their data, but only the CPRA and ADPPA allow individuals to opt out of transfers regardless of whether money changes hands.\n\nAmendments to the ADPPA\n\nFor the most part, the features we described above have been with the bill since its beginning. As of this writing, the ADPPA has just emerged from the House committee, where it was amended in certain ways to improve its odds in a House floor vote and in the Senate. Here’s what the committee changed.\n\nThe CPPA Gets to Enforce the ADPPA in California\n\nEnforcement has been a major criticism of this bill. California’s representatives are unhappy that the ADPPA might preempt their CPRA, which is generally stronger and has more teeth. Since California has a lot of sway in the US legislature, an amendment was made to make California’s CPRA enforcement agency — the California Privacy Protection Authority (CPPA) — responsible for enforcing the ADPPA in California. For other states, the FTC and/or attorney general would enforce the ADPPA.\n\nPrivate Right of Action Becomes Possible in Two Years\n\nThe original bill would have allowed for a private right of action to be permissible four years after enactment; this amendment makes it permissible in two.\n\nSmall Businesses Are Exempt From Private Action\n\nThis amendment excludes small businesses from private lawsuits if they make less than $25 million revenue annually, have fewer than 50,000 individuals’ covered data, and earn less than half their revenue from transferring covered data.\n\nGreater Exclusions for Employee Data\n\nLike other privacy laws, the ADPPA treats employee data differently from consumer data. This amendment expanded the carveout for employee data by including additional data categories.\n\nTiered Approach for What Constitutes “Knowledge” That a Consumer Is Under 17\n\nChildren’s data is treated differently than adult consumers’ data, but businesses can only treat data differently if they know that a consumer is under 17. This amendment created different definitions of what is considered “knowledge” that a consumer is under 17 depending on the size of the business.\n\nExclusion for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children\n\nThis amendment ensured that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children can work with children’s data legally. Without access to this data, the center would otherwise be unable to complete its mission of fighting child trafficking, abuse, and abduction.\n\nCriticisms of the ADPPA\n\nThe ADPPA is far from perfect, but it would also be better than nothing. Legislators naturally differ in whether they focus more on its flaws or its strengths.\n\nPrimarily, critics are concerned about the bill’s enforcement.\n\nWhile the ADPPA allows for civil enforcement through its private right of action, it does not have significant administrative enforcement. The GDPR, for instance, has dedicated data protection authorities that mete out penalties; under the ADPPA, enforcement would fall to either the FTC or state attorneys general, both of which have much more than just data privacy enforcement on their plates.\n\nIt additionally preempts other state laws with greater or lesser enforcement and coverage. The amendment to permit the CPPA to be the ADPPA enforcer in California was a compromise to ensure that the state wouldn’t be subject to weak enforcement if the CPRA were to be replaced by the ADPPA. But the ADPPA would also preempt states with more business-friendly data privacy laws, like Utah’s. That, in turn, has upset the more business-minded members of Congress.\n\nWhat’s Next for the ADPPA?\n\nAs of this writing, the ADPPA has successfully passed through the House committee, where it received the amendments described above. Now, it has to pass a vote in the House.\n\nIf it passes a vote, then the bill will be introduced in the Senate, where it will go into the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation for study. If the committee approves of the bill, then it will go to the Senate floor for a vote, and after that, to President Biden’s desk.\n\nWhat Are Its Chances?",
      "# [Who is Helen Nissenbaum? by Osano Staff on 2021-07-30](https://www.osano.com/articles/nissenbaum)\nHere at Osano, we name our major product feature releases after privacy heroes. Here's why our July feature release, Text Customization for Consent Manager, is named after Helen Nissenbaum.\n\nOne of the reasons it can be difficult for people to understand their privacy rights or for companies to make intelligent decisions is that privacy isn't easily defined. That's why Helen Nissenbaum's contribution to privacy theory is so significant.\n\nNissenbaum developed one of the most critical theoretical underpinnings for regulating data uses. While the U.S. framework currently relies on giving users \"notice\" and \"choice\" when companies seek to collect their data, Nissenbaum's work says that instead, the focus should be on \"contextual integrity.\"\n\nUsing contextual integrity means companies should evaluate whether the personal data they're collecting will be used in ways other than the initial purpose for which it was collected. Things can get slippery for companies sometimes in defining a customer's \"reasonable\" expectation of how you'll treat their data. Let's say you collect data from a customer to provide them a service, and then you want to sell that data to a company seeking to serve personalized ads. The Contextual Integrity Theory would say that you need to look at whether the customer would reasonably expect the data to be used for this purpose in light of the overall context in which they provided that data. Telling customers that you do this in a privacy policy may help, but it may not be enough on its own given that we know customers don't generally read the privacy policy and wouldn't likely expect their data to be used for this purpose.\n\nA real-life example of this might be helpful here. Think about Facebook's News Feed feature, which debuted in 2006 and \"fed\" users real-time updates on what their friends were posting; whether they'd broken up with their boyfriends and if they'd added any new connections, among other notifications. Not everyone liked the intrusion. One million people joined a \"Facebook News Feed protest group.\"\n\nThe crux of the problem was that users didn't expect Facebook to peer so closely into their lives and display that to their online connections. Offline, we understand how much privacy we expect based on context. If I close the door to my office, everyone understands I want space and privacy. If I'm sitting at a cafe, close to a friend and chatting quietly, no one would assume it'd be fine to stand nearby and cock an ear our way. But online, that context is difficult to perceive. So when Facebook's News Feed displays broadly that I broke up with my boyfriend, it feels invasive suddenly. Just because I signed up for Facebook and clicked \"yes\" to whatever I had to so I could join doesn't mean I'm expecting my personal details to be treated like a news scroll on cable TV.\n\nIn their article, “Contextual gaps: Privacy issues on Facebook,” Gordon Hull, Celine Latulipe and Heather Richter Lopfod write, \"Offline, privacy is mediated by highly granular social contexts. Online contexts, including social networking sites, lack much of this granularity. These contextual gaps are at the root of many of the sites' privacy issues.\"\n\nAnd that's what Nissenbaum would have advised Facebook to avoid out of respect for consumer privacy. (In the end, Facebook ignored the protests and the feature lives on.) In an age when companies often seem more interested in dodging liability than gaining customer trust, Nissenbaum's theory asks companies to do better. A contextual integrity framework looks at the data-use holistically. It requires data collectors to take an ethical approach that considers societal norms, which will always evolve. It asks data collectors to look at the context of the situation to determine what that \"norm\" is. Is the data subject in this context a patient? An online shopper? An existing customer? Is the data collector an online retailer? A doctor? What kind of information is being collected, and how will it be used? Once you take all of those factors into account, you can start to apply what the societal \"norm\" would be in the context at hand.\n\nIf Facebook looked at its plans through a contextual integrity lens, it likely would have decided the News Feed didn't align with users' expectations in joining the site and forking over their data.\n\nIn addition to her ethical contributions to the field, Nissenbaum, a professor of information science at Cornell Tech in New York City, is also director of the Digital Life Initiative. Launched in 2017, it aims to study the \"societal tensions arising from existing and emerging digital technologies. It takes into consideration ethics, policy, politics and quality of life.\n\nAmong other accolades, Nissenbaum received the International Association for Computing and Philosophy's 2021 Covey Award for her contributions to computing, ethics and philosophy.\n\nHer books include Obfuscation: A User's Guide to Privacy and Protest; Values at Play in Digital Games; and Privacy in Context: Technology, Policy and the Integrity of Social Life.",

Personal data shall be:\n\n(a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (lawfulness, fairness and transparency);\n\n(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes (purpose limitation);\n\n(c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (data minimisation);\n\n(d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (accuracy);\n\n(e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject (storage limitation);\n\n(f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (integrity and confidentiality).\n\n2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (accountability).\n\nArticle 6\n\nLawfulness of processing\n\n1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:\n\n(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;\n\n(b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;\n\n(c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;\n\n(d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;\n\n(e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;\n\n(f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n\nPoint (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.\n\n2. Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.\n\n3. The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by:\n\n(a) Union law; or\n\n(b) Member State law to which the controller is subject.\n\nThe purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.\n\n4. Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, take into account, inter alia:\n\n(a) any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended further processing;\n\n(b) the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data subjects and the controller;\n\n(c) the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article 10;\n\n(d) the possible consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects;\n\n(e) the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.\n\nArticle 7\n\nConditions for consent\n\n1. Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data.\n\n2. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.\n\n3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.\n\n4. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.\n\nArticle 8\n\nConditions applicable to child's consent in relation to information society services\n\n1. Where point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a child, the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.\n\nMember States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13 years.\n\n2. The controller shall make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child, taking into consideration available technology.\n\n3. Paragraph 1 shall not affect the general contract law of Member States such as the rules on the validity, formation or effect of a contract in relation to a child.\n\nArticle 9\n\nProcessing of special categories of personal data\n\n1. Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.\n\n2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies:\n\n(a) the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes, except where Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not be lifted by the data subject;\n\n(b) processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or of the data subject in the field of employment and social security and social protection law in so far as it is authorised by Union or Member State law or a collective agreement pursuant to Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject;\n\n(c) processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent;\n\n(d) processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activities with appropriate safeguards by a foundation, association or any other not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim and on condition that the processing relates solely to the members or to former members of the body or to persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the personal data are not disclosed outside that body without the consent of the data subjects;\n\n(e) processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the data subject;\n\n(f) processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity;\n\n(g) processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject;\n\n(h) processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services on the basis of Union or Member State law or pursuant to contract with a health professional and subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 3;\n\n(i) processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices, on the basis of Union or Member State law which provides for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject, in particular professional secrecy;\n\n(j) processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) based on Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject.\n\n3. Personal data referred to in paragraph 1 may be processed for the purposes referred to in point (h) of paragraph 2 when those data are processed by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to the obligation of professional secrecy under Union or Member State law or rules established by national competent bodies or by another person also subject to an obligation of secrecy under Union or Member State law or rules established by national competent bodies.\n\n4. Member States may maintain or introduce further conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric data or data concerning health.\n\nArticle 10\n\nProcessing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences\n\nProcessing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures based on Article 6(1) shall be carried out only under the control of official authority or when the processing is authorised by Union or Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Any comprehensive register of criminal convictions shall be kept only under the control of official authority.\n\nArticle 11\n\nProcessing which does not require identification\n\n1. If the purposes for which a controller processes personal data do not or do no longer require the identification of a data subject by the controller, the controller shall not be obliged to maintain, acquire or process additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with this Regulation.\n\n2. Where, in cases referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the controller is able to demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the data subject, the controller shall inform the data subject accordingly, if possible. In such cases, Articles 15 to 20 shall not apply except where the data subject, for the purpose of exercising his or her rights under those articles, provides additional information enabling his or her identification.\n\nCHAPTER III – Rights of the data subject\n\nSection 1 – Transparency and modalities\n\nArticle 12\n\nTransparent information, communication and modalities for the exercise of the rights of the data subject\n\n1. The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 and any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child. The information shall be provided in writing, or by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means. When requested by the data subject, the information may be provided orally, provided that the identity of the data subject is proven by other means.\n\n2. The controller shall facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Articles 15 to 22. In the cases referred to in Article 11(2), the controller shall not refuse to act on the request of the data subject for exercising his or her rights under Articles 15 to 22, unless the controller demonstrates that it is not in a position to identify the data subject.\n\n3. The controller shall provide information on action taken on a request under Articles 15 to 22 to the data subject without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. That period may be extended by two further months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. The controller shall inform the data subject of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay. Where the data subject makes the request by electronic form means, the information shall be provided by electronic means where possible, unless otherwise requested by the data subject.\n\n4. If the controller does not take action on the request of the data subject, the controller shall inform the data subject without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request of the reasons for not taking action and on the possibility of lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy.\n\n5. Information provided under Articles 13 and 14 and any communication and any actions taken under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 shall be provided free of charge. Where requests from a data subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the controller may either:\n\n(a) charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested; or\n\n(b) refuse to act on the request.\n\nThe controller shall bear the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the request.\n\n6. Without prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.\n\n7. The information to be provided to data subjects pursuant to Articles 13 and 14 may be provided in combination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible manner a meaningful overview of the intended processing. Where the icons are presented electronically they shall be machine-readable.\n\n8. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 92 for the purpose of determining the information to be presented by the icons and the procedures for providing standardised icons.\n\nSection 2 – Information and access to personal data\n\nArticle 13\n\nInformation to be provided where personal data are collected from the data subject\n\n1. Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from the data subject, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with all of the following information:\n\n(a) the identity and the contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the controller's representative;\n\n(b) the contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable;\n\n(c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing;\n\n(d) where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party;\n\n(e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any;\n\n(f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the means by which to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available.\n\n2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with the following further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing:\n\n(a) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;\n\n(b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to processing as well as the right to data portability;\n\n(c) where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal;\n\n(d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;\n\n(e) whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract, as well as whether the data subject is obliged to provide the personal data and of the possible consequences of failure to provide such data;\n\n(f) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.\n\n3. Where the controller intends to further process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were collected, the controller shall provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and with any relevant further information as referred to in paragraph 2.\n\n4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply where and insofar as the data subject already has the information.\n\nArticle 14\n\nInformation to be provided where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject\n\n1. Where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject, the controller shall provide the data subject with the following information:\n\n(a) the identity and the contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the controller's representative;\n\n(b) the contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable;\n\n(c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing;\n\n(d) the categories of personal data concerned;\n\n(e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any;\n\n(f) where applicable, that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a recipient in a third country or international organisation and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the means to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available.\n\n2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the data subject with the following information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject:\n\n(a) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;\n\n(b) where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party;\n\n(c) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject and to object to processing as well as the right to data portability;\n\n(d) where processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal;\n\n(e) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;\n\n(f) from which source the personal data originate, and if applicable, whether it came from publicly accessible sources;\n\n(g) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.\n\n3. The controller shall provide the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2:\n\n(a) within a reasonable period after obtaining the personal data, but at the latest within one month, having regard to the specific circumstances in which the personal data are processed;\n\n(b) if the personal data are to be used for communication with the data subject, at the latest at the time of the first communication to that data subject; or\n\n(c) if a disclosure to another recipient is envisaged, at the latest when the personal data are first disclosed.\n\n4. Where the controller intends to further process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were obtained, the controller shall provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and with any relevant further information as referred to in paragraph 2.\n\n5. Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not apply where and insofar as:\n\n(a) the data subject already has the information;\n\n(b) the provision of such information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort, in particular for processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in Article 89(1) or in so far as the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing. In such cases the controller shall take appropriate measures to protect the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, including making the information publicly available;\n\n(c) obtaining or disclosure is expressly laid down by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which provides appropriate measures to protect the data subject's legitimate interests; or\n\n(d) where the personal data must remain confidential subject to an obligation of professional secrecy regulated by Union or Member State law, including a statutory obligation of secrecy.\n\nArticle 15\n\nRight of access by the data subject\n\n1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the following information:\n\n(a) the purposes of the processing;\n\n(b) the categories of personal data concerned;\n\n(c) the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations;\n\n(d) where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;\n\n(e) the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject or to object to such processing;\n\n(f) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;\n\n(g) where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source;\n\n(h) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.\n\n2. Where personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 relating to the transfer.\n\n3. The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. For any further copies requested by the data subject, the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs. Where the data subject makes the request by electronic means, and unless otherwise requested by the data subject, the information shall be provided in a commonly used electronic form.\n\n4. The right to obtain a copy referred to in paragraph 3 shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.\n\nSection 3 – Rectification and erasure\n\nArticle 16\n\nRight to rectification\n\nThe data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.\n\nArticle 17\n\nRight to erasure (right to be forgotten)\n\n1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies:\n\n(a) the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed;\n\n(b) the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1), or point (a) of Article 9(2), and where there is no other legal ground for the processing;\n\n(c) the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2);\n\n(d) the personal data have been unlawfully processed;\n\n(e) the personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject;\n\n(f) the personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1).\n\n2. Where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph 1 to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data.\n\n3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary:\n\n(a) for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;\n\n(b) for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;\n\n(c) for reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with points (h) and (i) of Article 9(2) as well as Article 9(3);\n\n(d) for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) in so far as the right referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing; or\n\n(e) for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n\nArticle 18\n\nRight to restriction of processing\n\n1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:\n\n(a) the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;\n\n(b) the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests the restriction of their use instead;\n\n(c) the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;\n\n(d) the data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.\n\n2. Where processing has been restricted under paragraph 1, such personal data shall, with the exception of storage, only be processed with the data subject's consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or of a Member State.\n\n3. A data subject who has obtained restriction of processing pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be informed by the controller before the restriction of processing is lifted.\n\nArticle 19\n\nNotification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing\n\nThe controller shall communicate any rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing carried out in accordance with Article 16, Article 17(1) and Article 18 to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. The controller shall inform the data subject about those recipients if the data subject requests it.\n\nArticle 20\n\nRight to data portability\n\n1. The data subject shall have the right to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which he or she has provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, where:\n\n(a) the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2) or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1); and\n\n(b) the processing is carried out by automated means.\n\n2. In exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to paragraph 1, the data subject shall have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible.\n\n3. The exercise of the right referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be without prejudice to Article 17. That right shall not apply to processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.\n\n4. The right referred to in paragraph 1 shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.\n\nSection 4 – Right to object and automated individual decision-making\n\nArticle 21\n\nRight to object\n\n1. The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1), including profiling based on those provisions. The controller shall no longer process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n\n2. Where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.\n\n3. Where the data subject objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data shall no longer be processed for such purposes.\n\n4. At the latest at the time of the first communication with the data subject, the right referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject and shall be presented clearly and separately from any other information.\n\n5. In the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, the data subject may exercise his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.\n\n6. Where personal data are processed for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1), the data subject, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, shall have the right to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.\n\nArticle 22\n\nAutomated individual decision-making, including profiling\n\n1. The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her.\n\n2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the decision:\n\n(a) is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller;\n\n(b) is authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or\n\n(c) is based on the data subject's explicit consent.\n\n3. In the cases referred to in points (a) and (c) of paragraph 2, the data controller shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision.\n\n4. Decisions referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be based on special categories of personal data referred to in Article 9(1), unless point (a) or (g) of Article 9(2) applies and suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests are in place.\n\nSection 5 – Restrictions\n\nArticle 23\n\nRestrictions\n\n1. Union or Member State law to which the data controller or processor is subject may restrict by way of a legislative measure the scope of the obligations and rights provided for in Articles 12 to 22 and Article 34, as well as Article 5 in so far as its provisions correspond to the rights and obligations provided for in Articles 12 to 22, when such a restriction respects the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and is a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard:\n\n(a) national security;\n\n(b) defence;\n\n(c) public security;\n\n(d) the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security;\n\n(e) other important objectives of general public interest of the Union or of a Member State, in particular an important economic or financial interest of the Union or of a Member State, including monetary, budgetary and taxation a matters, public health and social security;\n\n(f) the protection of judicial independence and judicial proceedings;\n\n(g) the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of breaches of ethics for regulated professions;\n\n(h) a monitoring, inspection or regulatory function connected, even occasionally, to the exercise of official authority in the cases referred to in points (a) to (e) and (g);\n\n(i) the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others;\n\n(j) the enforcement of civil law claims.\n\n2. In particular, any legislative measure referred to in paragraph 1 shall contain specific provisions at least, where relevant, as to:\n\n(a) the purposes of the processing or categories of processing;\n\n(b) the categories of personal data;\n\n(c) the scope of the restrictions introduced;\n\n(d) the safeguards to prevent abuse or unlawful access or transfer;\n\n(e) the specification of the controller or categories of controllers;\n\n(f) the storage periods and the applicable safeguards taking into account the nature, scope and purposes of the processing or categories of processing;\n\n(g) the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects; and\n\n(h) the right of data subjects to be informed about the restriction, unless that may be prejudicial to the purpose of the restriction.\n\nCHAPTER IV – Controller and processor\n\nSection 1 – General obligations\n\nArticle 24\n\nResponsibility of the controller\n\n1. Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with this Regulation. Those measures shall be reviewed and updated where necessary.\n\n2. Where proportionate in relation to processing activities, the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the implementation of appropriate data protection policies by the controller.\n\n3. Adherence to approved codes of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or approved certification mechanisms as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate compliance with the obligations of the controller.\n\nArticle 25\n\nData protection by design and by default\n\n1. Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing, the controller shall, both at the time of the determination of the means for processing and at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, such as pseudonymisation, which are designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimisation, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects.\n\n2. The controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage and their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure that by default personal data are not made accessible without the individual's intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons.\n\n3. An approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.\n\nArticle 26\n\nJoint controllers\n\n1. Where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing, they shall be joint controllers. They shall in a transparent manner determine their respective responsibilities for compliance with the obligations under this Regulation, in particular as regards the exercising of the rights of the data subject and their respective duties to provide the information referred to in Articles 13 and 14, by means of an arrangement between them unless, and in so far as, the respective responsibilities of the controllers are determined by Union or Member State law to which the controllers are subject. The arrangement may designate a contact point for data subjects.\n\n2. The arrangement referred to in paragraph 1 shall duly reflect the respective roles and relationships of the joint controllers vis-à-vis the data subjects. The essence of the arrangement shall be made available to the data subject.\n\n3. Irrespective of the terms of the arrangement referred to in paragraph 1, the data subject may exercise his or her rights under this Regulation in respect of and against each of the controllers.\n\nArticle 27\n\nRepresentatives of controllers or processors not established in the Union\n\n1. Where Article 3(2) applies, the controller or the processor shall designate in writing a representative in the Union.\n\n2. The obligation laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to:\n\n(a) processing which is occasional, does not include, on a large scale, processing of special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1) or processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10, and is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, taking into account the nature, context, scope and purposes of the processing; or\n\n(b) a public authority or body.\n\n3. The representative shall be established in one of the Member States where the data subjects, whose personal data are processed in relation to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are.\n\n4. The representative shall be mandated by the controller or processor to be addressed in addition to or instead of the controller or the processor by, in particular, supervisory authorities and data subjects, on all issues related to processing, for the purposes of ensuring compliance with this Regulation.\n\n5. The designation of a representative by the controller or processor shall be without prejudice to legal actions which could be initiated against the controller or the processor themselves.\n\nArticle 28\n\nProcessor\n\n1. Where processing is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the controller shall use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject.\n\n2. The processor shall not engage another processor without prior specific or general written authorisation of the controller. In the case of general written authorisation, the processor shall inform the controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving the controller the opportunity to object to such changes.\n\n3. Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller. That contract or other legal act shall stipulate, in particular, that the processor:\n\n(a) processes the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, including with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject; in such a case, the processor shall inform the controller of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest;\n\n(b) ensures that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;\n\n(c) takes all measures required pursuant to Article 32;\n\n(d) respects the conditions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 for engaging another processor;\n\n(e) taking into account the nature of the processing, assists the controller by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the controller's obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights laid down in Chapter III;\n\n(f) assists the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor;\n\n(g) at the choice of the controller, deletes or returns all the personal data to the controller after the end of the provision of services relating to processing, and deletes existing copies unless Union or Member State law requires storage of the personal data;\n\n(h) makes available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this Article and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the controller or another auditor mandated by the controller.\n\nWith regard to point (h) of the first subparagraph, the processor shall immediately inform the controller if, in its opinion, an instruction infringes this Regulation or other Union or Member State data protection provisions.\n\n4. Where a processor engages another processor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of the controller, the same data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor as referred to in paragraph 3 shall be imposed on that other processor by way of a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation. Where that other processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, the initial processor shall remain fully liable to the controller for the performance of that other processor's obligations.\n\n5. Adherence of a processor to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification mechanism as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate sufficient guarantees as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Article.\n\n6. Without prejudice to an individual contract between the controller and the processor, the contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article may be based, in whole or in part, on standard contractual clauses referred to in paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article, including when they are part of a certification granted to the controller or processor pursuant to Articles 42 and 43.\n\n7. The Commission may lay down standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article and in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2).\n\n8. A supervisory authority may adopt standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article and in accordance with the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63.\n\n9. The contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be in writing, including in electronic form.\n\n10. Without prejudice to Articles 82, 83 and 84, if a processor infringes this Regulation by determining the purposes and means of processing, the processor shall be considered to be a controller in respect of that processing.\n\nArticle 29\n\nProcessing under the authority of the controller or processor\n\nThe processor and any person acting under the authority of the controller or of the processor, who has access to personal data, shall not process those data except on instructions from the controller, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law.\n\nArticle 30\n\nRecords of processing activities\n\n1. Each controller and, where applicable, the controller's representative, shall maintain a record of processing activities under its responsibility. That record shall contain all of the following information:\n\n(a) the name and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, the joint controller, the controller's representative and the data protection officer;\n\n(b) the purposes of the processing;\n\n(c) a description of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of personal data;\n\n(d) the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed including recipients in third countries or international organisations;\n\n(e) where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, including the identification of that third country or international organisation and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the documentation of suitable safeguards;\n\n(f) where possible, the envisaged time limits for erasure of the different categories of data;\n\n(g) where possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article 32(1).\n\n2. Each processor and, where applicable, the processor's representative shall maintain a record of all categories of processing activities carried out on behalf of a controller, containing:\n\n(a) the name and contact details of the processor or processors and of each controller on behalf of which the processor is acting, and, where applicable, of the controller's or the processor's representative, and the data protection officer;\n\n(b) the categories of processing carried out on behalf of each controller;\n\n(c) where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, including the identification of that third country or international organisation and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the documentation of suitable safeguards;\n\n(d) where possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article 32(1).\n\n3. The records referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be in writing, including in electronic form.\n\n4. The controller or the processor and, where applicable, the controller's or the processor's representative, shall make the record available to the supervisory authority on request.\n\n5. The obligations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to an enterprise or an organisation employing fewer than 250 persons unless the processing it carries out is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, the processing is not occasional, or the processing includes special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1) or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10.\n\nArticle 31\n\nCooperation with the supervisory authority\n\nThe controller and the processor and, where applicable, their representatives, shall cooperate, on request, with the supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks.\n\nSection 2 – Security of personal data\n\nArticle 32\n\nSecurity of processing\n\n1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate:\n\n(a) the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;\n\n(b) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;\n\n(c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;\n\n(d) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.\n\n2. In assessing the appropriate level of security account shall be taken in particular of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.\n\n3. Adherence to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification mechanism as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article.\n\n4. The controller and processor shall take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller, unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member State law.\n\nArticle 33\n\nNotification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority\n\n1. In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority competent in accordance with Article 55, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where the notification to the supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay.\n\n2. The processor shall notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach.\n\n3. The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least:\n\n(a) describe the nature of the personal data breach including where possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned;\n\n(b) communicate the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point where more information can be obtained;\n\n(c) describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach;\n\n(d) describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to address the personal data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.\n\n4. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide the information at the same time, the information may be provided in phases without undue further delay.\n\n5. The controller shall document any personal data breaches, comprising the facts relating to the personal data breach, its effects and the remedial action taken. That documentation shall enable the supervisory authority to verify compliance with this Article.\n\nArticle 34\n\nCommunication of a personal data breach to the data subject\n\n1. When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay.\n\n2. The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of the personal data breach and contain at least the information and measures referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 33(3).\n\n3. The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be required if any of the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures, and those measures were applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, in particular those that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption;\n\n(b) the controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1 is no longer likely to materialise;\n\n(c) it would involve disproportionate effort. In such a case, there shall instead be a public communication or similar measure whereby the data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner.\n\n4. If the controller has not already communicated the personal data breach to the data subject, the supervisory authority, having considered the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting in a high risk, may require it to do so or may decide that any of the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 are met.\n\nSection 3 – Data protection impact assessment and prior consultation\n\nArticle 35\n\nData protection impact assessment\n\n1. Where a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data. A single assessment may address a set of similar processing operations that present similar high risks.\n\n2. The controller shall seek the advice of the data protection officer, where designated, when carrying out a data protection impact assessment.\n\n3. A data protection impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall in particular be required in the case of:\n\n(a) a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural person;\n\n(b) processing on a large scale of special categories of data referred to in Article 9(1), or of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10; or\n\n(c) a systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale.\n\n4. The supervisory authority shall establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations which are subject to the requirement for a data protection impact assessment pursuant to paragraph 1. The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board referred to in Article 68.\n\n5. The supervisory authority may also establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations for which no data protection impact assessment is required. The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board.\n\n6. Prior to the adoption of the lists referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, the competent supervisory authority shall apply the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 where such lists involve processing activities which are related to the offering of goods or services to data subjects or to the monitoring of their behaviour in several Member States, or may substantially affect the free movement of personal data within the Union.\n\n7. The assessment shall contain at least:\n\n(a) a systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and the purposes of the processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller;\n\n(b) an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations in relation to the purposes;\n\n(c) an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1; and\n\n(d) the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned.\n\n8. Compliance with approved codes of conduct referred to in Article 40 by the relevant controllers or processors shall be taken into due account in assessing the impact of the processing operations performed by such controllers or processors, in particular for the purposes of a data protection impact assessment.\n\n9. Where appropriate, the controller shall seek the views of data subjects or their representatives on the intended processing, without prejudice to the protection of commercial or public interests or the security of processing operations.\n\n10. Where processing pursuant to point (c) or (e) of Article 6(1) has a legal basis in Union law or in the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject, that law regulates the specific processing operation or set of operations in question, and a data protection impact assessment has already been carried out as part of a general impact assessment in the context of the adoption of that legal basis, paragraphs 1 to 7 shall not apply unless Member States deem it to be necessary to carry out such an assessment prior to processing activities.\n\n11. Where necessary, the controller shall carry out a review to assess if processing is performed in accordance with the data protection impact assessment at least when there is a change of the risk represented by processing operations.\n\nArticle 36\n\nPrior consultation\n\n1. The controller shall consult the supervisory authority prior to processing where a data protection impact assessment under Article 35 indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the absence of measures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk.\n\n2. Where the supervisory authority is of the opinion that the intended processing referred to in paragraph 1 would infringe this Regulation, in particular where the controller has insufficiently identified or mitigated the risk, the supervisory authority shall, within period of up to eight weeks of receipt of the request for consultation, provide written advice to the controller and, where applicable to the processor, and may use any of its powers referred to in Article 58. That period may be extended by six weeks, taking into account the complexity of the intended processing. The supervisory authority shall inform the controller and, where applicable, the processor, of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request for consultation together with the reasons for the delay. Those periods may be suspended until the supervisory authority has obtained information it has requested for the purposes of the consultation.\n\n3. When consulting the supervisory authority pursuant to paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the supervisory authority with:\n\n(a) where applicable, the respective responsibilities of the controller, joint controllers and processors involved in the processing, in particular for processing within a group of undertakings;\n\n(b) the purposes and means of the intended processing;\n\n(c) the measures and safeguards provided to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects pursuant to this Regulation;\n\n(d) where applicable, the contact details of the data protection officer;\n\n(e) the data protection impact assessment provided for in Article 35; and\n\n(f) any other information requested by the supervisory authority.\n\n4. Member States shall consult the supervisory authority during the preparation of a proposal for a legislative measure to be adopted by a national parliament, or of a regulatory measure based on such a legislative measure, which relates to processing.\n\n5. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Member State law may require controllers to consult with, and obtain prior authorisation from, the supervisory authority in relation to processing by a controller for the performance of a task carried out by the controller in the public interest, including processing in relation to social protection and public health.\n\nSection 4 – Data protection officer\n\nArticle 37\n\nDesignation of the data protection officer\n\n1. The controller and the processor shall designate a data protection officer in any case where:\n\n(a) the processing is carried out by a public authority or body, except for courts acting in their judicial capacity;\n\n(b) the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing operations which, by virtue of their nature, their scope and/or their purposes, require regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale; or\n\n(c) the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing on a large scale of special categories of data pursuant to Article 9 or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10.\n\n2. A group of undertakings may appoint a single data protection officer provided that a data protection officer is easily accessible from each establishment.\n\n3. Where the controller or the processor is a public authority or body, a single data protection officer may be designated for several such authorities or bodies, taking account of their organisational structure and size.\n\n4. In cases other than those referred to in paragraph 1, the controller or processor or associations and other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors may or, where required by Union or Member State law shall, designate a data protection officer. The data protection officer may act for such associations and other bodies representing controllers or processors.\n\n5. The data protection officer shall be designated on the basis of professional qualities and, in particular, expert knowledge of data protection law and practices and the ability to fulfil the tasks referred to in Article 39.\n\n6. The data protection officer may be a staff member of the controller or processor, or fulfil the tasks on the basis of a service contract.\n\n7. The controller or the processor shall publish the contact details of the data protection officer and communicate them to the supervisory authority.\n\nArticle 38\n\nPosition of the data protection officer\n\n1. The controller and the processor shall ensure that the data protection officer is involved, properly and in a timely manner, in all issues which relate to the protection of personal data.\n\n2. The controller and processor shall support the data protection officer in performing the tasks referred to in Article 39 by providing resources necessary to carry out those tasks and access to personal data and processing operations, and to maintain his or her expert knowledge.\n\n3. The controller and processor shall ensure that the data protection officer does not receive any instructions regarding the exercise of those tasks. He or she shall not be dismissed or penalised by the controller or the processor for performing his tasks. The data protection officer shall directly report to the highest management level of the controller or the processor.\n\n4. Data subjects may contact the data protection officer with regard to all issues related to processing of their personal data and to the exercise of their rights under this Regulation.\n\n5. The data protection officer shall be bound by secrecy or confidentiality concerning the performance of his or her tasks, in accordance with Union or Member State law.\n\n6. The data protection officer may fulfil other tasks and duties. The controller or processor shall ensure that any such tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests.\n\nArticle 39\n\nTasks of the data protection officer\n\n1. The data protection officer shall have at least the following tasks:\n\n(a) to inform and advise the controller or the processor and the employees who carry out processing of their obligations pursuant to this Regulation and to other Union or Member State data protection provisions;\n\n(b) to monitor compliance with this Regulation, with other Union or Member State data protection provisions and with the policies of the controller or processor in relation to the protection of personal data, including the assignment of responsibilities, awareness-raising and training of staff involved in processing operations, and the related audits;\n\n(c) to provide advice where requested as regards the data protection impact assessment and monitor its performance pursuant to Article 35;\n\n(d) to cooperate with the supervisory authority;\n\n(e) to act as the contact point for the supervisory authority on issues relating to processing, including the prior consultation referred to in Article 36, and to consult, where appropriate, with regard to any other matter.\n\n2. The data protection officer shall in the performance of his or her tasks have due regard to the risk associated with processing operations, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing.\n\nSection 5 – Codes of conduct and certification\n\nArticle 40\n\nCodes of conduct\n\n1. The Member States, the supervisory authorities, the Board and the Commission shall encourage the drawing up of codes of conduct intended to contribute to the proper application of this Regulation, taking account of the specific features of the various processing sectors and the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n2. Associations and other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors may prepare codes of conduct, or amend or extend such codes, for the purpose of specifying the application of this Regulation, such as with regard to:\n\n(a) fair and transparent processing;\n\n(b) the legitimate interests pursued by controllers in specific contexts;\n\n(c) the collection of personal data;\n\n(d) the pseudonymisation of personal data;\n\n(e) the information provided to the public and to data subjects;\n\n(f) the exercise of the rights of data subjects;\n\n(g) the information provided to, and the protection of, children, and the manner in which the consent of the holders of parental responsibility over children is to be obtained;\n\n(h) the measures and procedures referred to in Articles 24 and 25 and the measures to ensure security of processing referred to in Article 32;\n\n(i) the notification of personal data breaches to supervisory authorities and the communication of such personal data breaches to data subjects;\n\n(j) the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations; or\n\n(k) out-of-court proceedings and other dispute resolution procedures for resolving disputes between controllers and data subjects with regard to processing, without prejudice to the rights of data subjects pursuant to Articles 77 and 79.\n\n3. In addition to adherence by controllers or processors subject to this Regulation, codes of conduct approved pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article and having general validity pursuant to paragraph 9 of this Article may also be adhered to by controllers or processors that are not subject to this Regulation pursuant to Article 3 in order to provide appropriate safeguards within the framework of personal data transfers to third countries or international organisations under the terms referred to in point (e) of Article 46(2). Such controllers or processors shall make binding and enforceable commitments, via contractual or other legally binding instruments, to apply those appropriate safeguards including with regard to the rights of data subjects.\n\n4. A code of conduct referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall contain mechanisms which enable the body referred to in Article 41(1) to carry out the mandatory monitoring of compliance with its provisions by the controllers or processors which undertake to apply it, without prejudice to the tasks and powers of supervisory authorities competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56.\n\n5. Associations and other bodies referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article which intend to prepare a code of conduct or to amend or extend an existing code shall submit the draft code, amendment or extension to the supervisory authority which is competent pursuant to Article 55. The supervisory authority shall provide an opinion on whether the draft code, amendment or extension complies with this Regulation and shall approve that draft code, amendment or extension if it finds that it provides sufficient appropriate safeguards.\n\n6. Where the draft code, or amendment or extension is approved in accordance with paragraph 5, and where the code of conduct concerned does not relate to processing activities in several Member States, the supervisory authority shall register and publish the code.\n\n7. Where a draft code of conduct relates to processing activities in several Member States, the supervisory authority which is competent pursuant to Article 55 shall, before approving the draft code, amendment or extension, submit it in the procedure referred to in Article 63 to the Board which shall provide an opinion on whether the draft code, amendment or extension complies with this Regulation or, in the situation referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, provides appropriate safeguards.\n\n8. Where the opinion referred to in paragraph 7 confirms that the draft code, amendment or extension complies with this Regulation, or, in the situation referred to in paragraph 3, provides appropriate safeguards, the Board shall submit its opinion to the Commission.\n\n9. The Commission may, by way of implementing acts, decide that the approved code of conduct, amendment or extension submitted to it pursuant to paragraph 8 of this Article have general validity within the Union. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure set out in Article 93(2).\n\n10. The Commission shall ensure appropriate publicity for the approved codes which have been decided as having general validity in accordance with paragraph 9.\n\n11. The Board shall collate all approved codes of conduct, amendments and extensions in a register and shall make them publicly available by way of appropriate means.\n\nArticle 41\n\nMonitoring of approved codes of conduct\n\n1. Without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the competent supervisory authority under Articles 57 and 58, the monitoring of compliance with a code of conduct pursuant to Article 40 may be carried out by a body which has an appropriate level of expertise in relation to the subject-matter of the code and is accredited for that purpose by the competent supervisory authority.\n\n2. A body as referred to in paragraph 1 may be accredited to monitor compliance with a code of conduct where that body has:\n\n(a) demonstrated its independence and expertise in relation to the subject-matter of the code to the satisfaction of the competent supervisory authority;\n\n(b) established procedures which allow it to assess the eligibility of controllers and processors concerned to apply the code, to monitor their compliance with its provisions and to periodically review its operation;\n\n(c) established procedures and structures to handle complaints about infringements of the code or the manner in which the code has been, or is being, implemented by a controller or processor, and to make those procedures and structures transparent to data subjects and the public; and\n\n(d) demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent supervisory authority that its tasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests.\n\n3. The competent supervisory authority shall submit the draft requirements for accreditation of a body as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to the Board pursuant to the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63.\n\n4. Without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the competent supervisory authority and the provisions of Chapter VIII, a body as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall, subject to appropriate safeguards, take appropriate action in cases of infringement of the code by a controller or processor, including suspension or exclusion of the controller or processor concerned from the code. It shall inform the competent supervisory authority of such actions and the reasons for taking them.\n\n5. The competent supervisory authority shall revoke the accreditation of a body as referred to in paragraph 1 if the requirements for accreditation are not, or are no longer, met or where actions taken by the body infringe this Regulation.\n\n6. This Article shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities and bodies.\n\nArticle 42\n\nCertification\n\n1. The Member States, the supervisory authorities, the Board and the Commission shall encourage, in particular at Union level, the establishment of data protection certification mechanisms and of data protection seals and marks, for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with this Regulation of processing operations by controllers and processors. The specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises shall be taken into account.\n\n2. In addition to adherence by controllers or processors subject to this Regulation, data protection certification mechanisms, seals or marks approved pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article may be established for the purpose of demonstrating the existence of appropriate safeguards provided by controllers or processors that are not subject to this Regulation pursuant to Article 3 within the framework of personal data transfers to third countries or international organisations under the terms referred to in point (f) of Article 46(2). Such controllers or processors shall make binding and enforceable commitments, via contractual or other legally binding instruments, to apply those appropriate safeguards, including with regard to the rights of data subjects.\n\n3. The certification shall be voluntary and available via a process that is transparent.\n\n4. A certification pursuant to this Article does not reduce the responsibility of the controller or the processor for compliance with this Regulation and is without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the supervisory authorities which are competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56.\n\n5. A certification pursuant to this Article shall be issued by the certification bodies referred to in Article 43 or by the competent supervisory authority, on the basis of criteria approved by that competent supervisory authority pursuant to Article 58(3) or by the Board pursuant to Article 63. Where the criteria are approved by the Board, this may result in a common certification, the European Data Protection Seal.\n\n6. The controller or processor which submits its processing to the certification mechanism shall provide the certification body referred to in Article 43, or where applicable, the competent supervisory authority, with all information and access to its processing activities which are necessary to conduct the certification procedure.\n\n7. Certification shall be issued to a controller or processor for a maximum period of three years and may be renewed, under the same conditions, provided that the relevant ",

The casting choices also scream Hollywood thinks all East Asians are alike, and of course forgets all Asians are not East Asians.\n\nAll and all, the hiring of creatives and casting were attempts are diversity that fell short and misstep.

It's been a while, so I don't remember which client it was otherwise I'd probably see if I still had access to their GTM to refresh my memory!\n\nUltimately, it can be done by examining the content of the Iubenda consent cookie, but by checking your site I can see if there's a neater solution. Working with cookie values is fine, but sometimes cookies take a fraction of a second too long to have their value set and you end up trying to fire a tag and it fails because the check of the cookie's value is wrong because the cookie wasn't set in time.\n\n## Comment ID lcd93pq with +1 score by [(Semboxsrl, Reddit, 2024-07-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/1dtginm/need_help_setting_up_cookies_consent_for_ga4_with/lcd93pq/) (in reply to ID 1dtginm):\nAs a web developer working for a Web Agency I can help with such problems, please DM me\n\n## Comment ID legc4op with +1 score by [(Yallone, Reddit, 2024-07-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleTagManager/comments/1dtginm/need_help_setting_up_cookies_consent_for_ga4_with/legc4op/) (in reply to ID 1dtginm):\nAre you still in need of help?",

Verdant brink HoT HP are okay as well, but beyond that helps to find a group.\n\n### Comment ID k55d1lv with +3 score by [(ZeroZeroNana, Reddit, 2023-10-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/178p3y0/when_do_hot_or_pof_hp_trains_appear_are_there_any/k55d1lv/) (in reply to ID k513s8v):\nHoT Hero Points... \\*cries in Coztic Itzel Belongings\\*\n\n## Comment ID k5166nt with +12 score by [(Eona_Targaryen, Reddit, 2023-10-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/178p3y0/when_do_hot_or_pof_hp_trains_appear_are_there_any/k5166nt/) (in reply to ID 178p3y0):\nOn NA, I most often see HOT trains starting during primetime on weekend nights. LFG is traditionally posted in the Verdant Brink section. Couldn't tell you what guilds are responsible though.\n\nPOF is harder to say, I feel like they're rarer due to POF being largely soloable.\n\n### Comment ID k51ducd with +7 score by [(TerkYerJerb, Reddit, 2023-10-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/178p3y0/when_do_hot_or_pof_hp_trains_appear_are_there_any/k51ducd/) (in reply to ID k5166nt):\nthere is this Squad for HP Train person (i think that's the character's name), watch out for when a call gets shouted around some hub maps as well\n\n#### Comment ID k52c356 with +11 score by [(DynoMenace, Reddit, 2023-10-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/178p3y0/when_do_hot_or_pof_hp_trains_appear_are_there_any/k52c356/) (in reply to ID k51ducd):\nTheir account name is Osano.4860, they openly invite people to add them to their friends list and watch for trains.

It's about the mindset and approach of the leaders. I've never felt so empowered yet supported by everyone from my manager to my direct team members. The culture is very curious, not judgemental. This leads to really open discussions with diverse perspectives that result in great ideas and actionable plans. \n\nThe culture is also very family-first. Go to your son's fall festival, take time to see your parents, take a few days to help your sister move, step away to go pick up your kids. We all do it. \n\nOther pros include: \n- The company is on fire. It's in a rapidly growing space and we have the best product by far.\n- You get to work alongside people are who REALLY good at what they do. Sure, we're all still growing our crafts, but man have we hired some experts. \n- Everything is really well organized. From onboarding to IT requests, it's so well automated. \n- Transparent company OKRs help the company stay focused and aligned \n- Swag quality is top notch :)",

This leads to really open discussions with diverse perspectives that result in great ideas and actionable plans. \n\nThe culture is also very family-first. Go to your son's fall festival, take time to see your parents, take a few days to help your sister move, step away to go pick up your kids. We all do it. \n\nOther pros include: \n- The company is on fire. It's in a rapidly growing space and we have the best product by far.\n- You get to work alongside people are who REALLY good at what they do. Sure, we're all still growing our crafts, but man have we hired some experts. \n- Everything is really well organized. From onboarding to IT requests, it's so well automated. \n- Transparent company OKRs help the company stay focused and aligned \n- Swag quality is top notch :)",

WireWheel's solutions include its industry-leading privacy assessment tools, built to support data privacy programs at scale with the technical capabilities, customizability and deployment options that enterprise customers require. WireWheel's capabilities will be fully integrated into the Osano platform.\n\nThe acquisition of WireWheel enhances Osano's platform with enterprise-grade assessment solutions that automate the process of auditing data, identifying privacy risks, prioritizing actions, creating required regulatory documentation, and conducting actionable reporting. WireWheel's assessment solutions address critical needs such as privacy impact assessments (PIA) and record of processing activity (RoPA) assessments and were recently recognized by IDC as a leader in that category. These are vitally important capabilities in a rapidly changing regulatory environment characterized by a patchwork of laws that vary greatly from country to country and state to state.\n\n\"This acquisition is high-impact for Osano and WireWheel's customers because the two companies' solutions complement one another so well,\" said Arlo Gilbert, CEO of Osano. \"Adding WireWheel's technology to our platform delivers major advantages for enterprise customers, who will benefit from the scalability, customizability, customer experience and advanced features that address the needs of deploying data privacy programs at scale. The Osano platform will continue to be the easiest to deploy and use. In an industry where too many platforms have, in reality, many disconnected features that are difficult to deploy and use, our platform truly works.\"\n\nThe integration of these assessment solutions into the Osano platform will also be valuable for companies pursuing AI initiatives which utilize corporate data models. Companies have to make a significant investment in training AI models with large datasets. However, that data must undergo thorough scrubbing to eliminate private information. Inadvertently including incorrect data requires the destruction of the AI model, leading to a massive investment loss. The capabilities that WireWheel brings to the Osano platform will enable companies to pursue these AI initiatives with confidence.\n\nOsano is actively assessing other potential acquisitions that will expand its platform and its global footprint.\n\nArlo Gilbert added: \"This is the first in a series of strategic acquisitions that Osano anticipates making to expand our platform and increase our leadership position in the data privacy market. We are rigorously evaluating other potential acquisitions that align with our strategy and enhance the value we deliver to our rapidly growing global customer base.\"\n\nFinancial terms of this acquisition are not being disclosed.

The Osano platform empowers businesses to confidently navigate the complex, quickly evolving data privacy landscape, while enabling privacy professionals to seamlessly uphold and apply privacy standards organization-wide.\n\nUnlike other privacy solutions, Osano's privacy management platform is purpose-built to help companies navigate the complexities of creating a cross functional approach to global compliance, risk management, and privacy operations excellence, as they work to uphold the highest data privacy standards. Whether working on a single use case or building a whole program, Osano grows with an organization as its privacy programs mature:\n\nCookie Consent: Achieve compliance without the legwork by automating consent management for data privacy laws in 50+ countries.\n\nUnified Consent and Preference Hub: Simplify compliance, enhance privacy, and build trust with an intuitive, centralized system for managing consents and preferences across touchpoints.\n\nData Mapping: Know your data, inside and out, through automated visualization and classification of data stores, ensuring alignment with your privacy risk strategy.\n\nSubject Rights Management: Process requests in less time with more confidence by automating subject rights workflows and data discovery.\n\nAssessments: Simplify and centralize assessments with built-in and custom templates for privacy evaluations.\n\nVendor Privacy Risk Management: Transition from insight to action by proactively identifying, tracking, and managing privacy risks.\n\n\"If you have used data privacy platforms in the past and were left frustrated or disappointed, you're not alone. Too many of those offerings were either loosely connected bundles or complex systems that caused more problems than they solved. Osano's platform changes all of that,\" said Arlo Gilbert, CEO of Osano. \"It is a true platform with tightly integrated capabilities that is easy to use and implement, delivering immediate value. And it is built to grow with customers as they grow their data privacy strategy and programs over time.\"\n\nAnd customers agree. \"The privacy landscape can be difficult to navigate when it is not your sole job responsibility. While investigating solutions . . . Osano became the obvious choice from an ease of use and automation standpoint,\" said Peter Ostashen, Director of IT at Francisco Partners. \"Their post-sales support team is top tier, and I would recommend them to anyone looking to solve this need.\"\n\nWith Osano, businesses can demonstrate compliance with privacy laws confidently, manage user consent in real-time, and leverage valuable insights for targeted marketing and innovation, all while respecting user privacy and enhancing trust.\n\nOsano is demonstrating this platform—including the new Unified Consent and Custom Assessment solutions—at IAPP Global Privacy Summit 2024 on April 3-4 in Washington, D.C.

      "# [A Major Milestone for Osano...and the Industry by Arlo Gilbert on 2023-12-05](https://www.osano.com/articles/osano-acquires-wirewheel)\nWhen we founded Osano, our goals were ambitious. We wanted to dramatically simplify how companies ensure data privacy and comply in the face of ever-changing regulations. We wanted to help consumers trust that their data and privacy are being protected. And we wanted to build a company that our customers, partners, and employees can believe in.\n\nWe have achieved a long list of milestones in pursuit of those goals since we were founded in 2018.\n\nWe have built the most intuitively integrated, easiest-to-use data privacy platform in the industry.\n\nWe have been recognized as a leader in consent and a momentum leader in data privacy management by industry analysts.\n\nWe have been named a Best Place to Work multiple times by publications such as Fortune and Inc. Magazine in recognition of the people-centric culture and environment at Osano.\n\nWe have been recognized as an emerging company that is transforming our industry by experts at TechCrunch and other media.\n\nWe have built a financial foundation that has made us the data privacy company that customers know they can count on to be around for the long haul.\n\nWe have been certified as B-corporation whose work benefits the public through improved data transparency and privacy for consumers.\n\nAnd so many others.\n\nToday, there is a new milestone to add to this list. Osano has acquired WireWheel, a leading provider of enterprise data privacy solutions. This is big news for every company that needs to build and manage a large-scale data privacy program.\n\nWhat WireWheel's Acquisition Means\n\nWireWheel’s enterprise-grade assessment solutions automate the process of auditing data, identifying privacy risks, prioritizing actions, creating required regulatory documentation, and conducting actionable reporting. They are a perfect complement for the capabilities in the Osano platform.\n\nAdding WireWheel’s technology to our platform delivers major advantages for enterprise customers, making the best data privacy platform in the industry even better. Enterprise customers will benefit from the scalability, customizability, customer experience, and advanced features that WireWheel’s technology brings to the Osano platform.\n\nIntegrating WireWheel’s assessment capabilities also makes our platform a must-have for enterprise customers who are pursuing AI initiatives. To train their AI models, companies need to feed large datasets into the process, but that data cannot contain private information. If private data is mistakenly included, the AI model must be destroyed (sometimes known as algorithm disgorgement or model deletion) – a major setback for these significant investments. WireWheel has the best assessment tools in the industry, which enables companies to be confident about the data they are using in AI models.\n\nFor all of those reasons, this acquisition is a major new milestone for Osano as we wrap up 2023.\n\nAnd even bigger things are on the horizon for the coming year. I’m so proud that we are building a company that is not only an industry leader, but also is a company that lives and breathes those ambitious goals we set when we were founded. Much more to come in 2024!",
      "# [(NOAH) Osano Kagehiro's \"Discovering Pro Wrestling History\" ~ The Lone Pro Wrestler, Yoshinari Ogawa retires by Hisame (冰雨\\Pro-Wrestling Noah in English) on 2024-09-06](https://puroprogramtranslations.blogspot.com/2024/09/noah-osano-kagehiros-discovering-pro.html)\n6th September 2024\n\nNicovideo.jp\n\n*Note, this is a pay to see the full article, so I have translated only what is free*\n\nQ: After all the cyber attacks, this is the first time we've interviewed Osano in a while, so we'll have him look back on the latest news in the pro wrestling world\n\nOSANO: Thank you.\n\nQ: First up, is Yoshinari Ogawa's sudden announcement of his retirement. The main reason is the condition of his neck, but what's surprising is that he won't have a retirement match or a retirement ceremony.\n\nOSANO: That's typical of him. He's always been like, \"Well then...\" and just walks away. Forty years ago, when I became a reporter covering All Japan Pro Wrestling, he was a seventeen year old new trainee. He was the first wrestler I saw make his debut, and because of that relationship we were good friends and he opened up to me, but he generally refused interviews. We have been friends a long time, but I have only officially interviewed him twice.\n\nQ: But only two interviews means that you couldn't interview him elsewhere.\n\nOSANO: He agreed to do it both times because Tenryu was the theme. When I was making a special issue of \"Gong\" about the Tenryu Alliance, I asked Ogawa directly, and he said, \"If it's about Tenryu, that's fine,\" so I did it without going through Noah, but after the book came out, Ryu Nakata* complained (laughs). You see, at that time Tenryu had just returned to All Japan and there was tension between them and Noah.\n\nQ: From Noah's point of view, talking about All Japan was not good. That's why you didn't go through the promotion (laughs).\n\nOSANO: But Ogawa is okay with it if the topic is Tenryu. The other interview was for a G Spirits Tenryu special when he announced his retirement.\n\nQ: I like that Tenryu was the topic both times.\n\nOSANO: I want to talk about technique, but that's a no-go. It's fine to talk about that in casual conversation, but it's not okay to write about it. And yet he's been doing commentary for Noah recently, which is surprising (laughs).\n\nQ: He didn't have a retirement match, he didn't give interviews, and no matter what you try, he won't budge.\n\nOSANO: After he became Tenryu's assistant, he had the image of not listening to anyone but Tenryu. That being said, he didn't directly ask to join the Tenryu Alliance, but Tenryu made him wear a REVOLUTION T-shirt, and told him, \"You are in the Tenryu Alliance\". That's how it happened, but he had a lot of respect for Tenryu, and although their wrestling styles were different, I think he was attracted to Tenryu's way of life as a person. For example, he was paid for doing laundry during the tour, and by the end of it, he had more than his salary (laughs).\n\nQ: So the fee for doing your laundry was a ridiculous amount? (laughs)\n\nOSANO: But, because he was with that kind of person, he didn't save any money. He was taught how to spend it, but not how to save it (laughs).\n\nQ: Tokyoites and wrestlers, they don't hold on to money!\n\nOSANO: The reason why he's always seemed like a loner, is because not a single person from his generation remained, everyone left halfway through. Mister Cacao was also in the same year, but he quit. Also, the year after he joined, guys from Japan Pro Wrestling* came in, and the number of wrestlers increased dramatically, but he was still so thin, so he couldn't make his debut. He finally made his debut in 1985, but he had been more than a year since he joined.\n\nQ: It takes more than a year from joining to debuting, right?\n\nOSANO: Kabuki, who used to go back and forth between America and Japan, was so surprised that he asked him, \"You haven't debuted yet?\". Even after his debut, he had to take long breaks due to a habit of dislocating his left knee, and during that time his juniors, Kenta Kobashi, Tsuyoshi Kikuchi, and Koki Kitahara, all rose to prominence, which was an unfortunate life for him as a young wrestler. Ogawa said, \"Kobashi and the others were being promoted, but I was just a junior wrestler. I was aware that \"I'm not necessary.\"\n\nQ: All Japan didn't seem to be interested in promoting Yoshinari Ogawa at the time...\n\nOSANO: Well, with a body that thin, there was no way that Baba would even think of promoting him.\n\n(I have taken the pictures from a variety of other sources as there were none with the article)\n\nNotes\n\nRyu Nakata: Noah's long suffering former manager. A participant in the ticket scandal, he was demoted to a general employee. He passed away (allegedly) of a heart attack in his car outside of a rural gas station in 2014.\n\nJapan Pro Wrestling: Rikidozan's former promotion. Antonio Inoki left and formed New Japan, while Baba formed All Japan. The promotion was destroyed by massive corruption.",

WireWheel’s capabilities will be fully integrated into the Osano platform.\n\n\"This acquisition is high-impact for Osano and WireWheel’s customers because the two companies’ solutions complement one another so well,\" said Arlo Gilbert, CEO of Osano. \"Adding WireWheel’s technology to our platform delivers major advantages for enterprise customers, who will benefit from the scalability, customizability, customer experience and advanced features that address the needs of deploying data privacy programs at scale. The Osano platform will continue to be the easiest to deploy and use. In an industry where too many platforms have, in reality, many disconnected features that are difficult to deploy and use, our platform truly works.\"",
      "# [Announcing The Privacy Insider Book by Osano Staff on 2024-02-29](https://www.osano.com/articles/announcing-privacy-insider)\nFor decades, unchecked data collection and processing was the norm—today, not so much. The sudden shift in thinking around data privacy has left many feeling out of the loop, uncertain about why data privacy matters and how they can wrap their head around their new regulatory obligations.\n\nOsano's CEO, Arlo Gilbert, doesn't think you should feel left out of the loop when it comes to data privacy. Nor does he think that it should be complicated to just do the right thing. That’s why he, along with cofounder Scott Hertel, founded Osano based on these principles. It's why they've helped cultivate an organization and company culture that focuses on creating delightful experiences for our customers and educates our audience, and it’s why Arlo wrote The Privacy Insider.\n\nIn this soon-to-be-published book, Arlo lays out the relevant information for you to understand and operationalize data privacy in simple, clear language that focuses on what’s relevant to businesses seeking to do the right thing. Ultimately, The Privacy Insider will help you navigate the privacy ecosystem and arm you with the strategy you need to become a long-lasting, successful, trusted brand.\n\nHere’s a sneak peek from the first few chapters:\n\nPeople who feel they lead boring lives with nothing to hide may still not be alarmed by all of this. But what many folks don’t consider is that as cultural, societal, leadership, and governmental changes take place, new perspectives can change how our actions are viewed. Activities that were once considered harmless can be held against us and our fellow citizens. Information you previously shared about yourself or data you generated can even turn into admissions to crimes. Think about it: laws related to actions like medical procedures, uses of certain drugs, and who we can marry have changed worldwide in recent years alone. What if a future US Supreme Court decision takes away certain civil liberties that we value? It happened with abortion when Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. We don’t know what future government leaders will stand for, how societal perspectives will change, or how our actions may be interpreted under evolving laws.\n\nOur concerns also go beyond criminal accusations. The issue of governments’ access to personal data through private companies is rife with problems. The situation is especially sticky in the United States, where the data broker industry is largely unregulated, and yet government agencies often rely on private brokers to carry out their work.\n\nIn just one example, it’s been widely reported that ICE searched a database of personal information provided by LexisNexis over 1.2 million times between March and September 2021 alone.91 And the Intercept reported that in 2021, LexisNexis entered a $16.8 million contract with ICE, wherein the data broker is providing ICE with access to billions of records containing personal data aggregated from public and private sources, including credit history, bankruptcy records, license plate images, and cellular subscriber information.92\n\nLexisNexis faces ongoing backlash for the deal. In 2022, it was sued over its mass collection and sale of Illinoisans’ data without their consent.93 Antonio Gutierrez, strategic coordinator for Organized Communities Against Deportations (one of the advocacy groups behind the lawsuit), explained, “LexisNexis is violating individuals’ privacy rights by providing addresses, phone numbers, relatives’ names, and more through the data being sold to agencies like ICE without their permission.”94 Meanwhile, LexisNexis has been in the spotlight for reporting inaccurate data. Along with Experian, it was part of a 2022 class action lawsuit claiming that it published inaccurate and derogatory credit information, failed to maintain reasonable procedures in accurately reporting credit information, and failed to properly investigate credit information.95 ICE is using its data nonetheless. And this is just one glimpse into the larger problem.\n\n[. . .]\n\nAs legislation around government access to private data evolves and unfolds, our roles as data stewards become more important than ever. We must do our due diligence to be aware of all the third parties with whom we’re sharing our users’ data. And we need to be clear about how the third parties with whom we’re sharing our data will use it. That can feel like a tall order, but the good news is that a strong data-privacy program will make these actions a part of your typical workflow. We have more power to protect personal data than it may seem.",
