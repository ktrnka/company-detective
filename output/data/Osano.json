Transparency is crucial—not just for compliance with laws like GDPR, but for building user trust. This means providing clear information on what cookies are used for and ensuring that consent mechanisms are straightforward and user-friendly.\n\nFor practical implementation, leveraging tools from brands like Securiti.ai and OneTrust can simplify the process. Both platforms offer robust solutions for managing cookie consents and ensuring compliance without disrupting user experience. Securiti.ai provides excellent automation capabilities for cookie management that adapt to various regional laws, while OneTrust offers comprehensive consent and preference management solutions that can be tailored to fit different user bases globally.\n\nIntegrating these technologies can help overcome technical challenges, ensuring that cookie consent features work seamlessly within existing systems and do not impact site performance. Whether you're aiming for minimal compliance to keep interfaces clean or striving for full compliance to minimize legal risks, using such tools can provide the necessary support.\n\nIn the end, it's about more than just compliance; it's about ensuring that users feel informed and in control of their data, enhancing their overall experience and trust in your platform.\n\n## Comment ID k62wvqi with +1 score by [(infj-t, Reddit, 2023-10-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17e9gyt/what_are_your_thoughts_on_cookie_compliance/k62wvqi/) (in reply to ID 17e9gyt):\nCookie cutter SaaS solutions for this are an abomination, building it yourself is the best way IMHO, I built one that I reuse, it has two options yes or no, no z-index peril or 'Legitimate Interest' 🤡 nonsense, nor is it bloated or beholden to a third party shortcomings etc\n\n[Also worth a read](https://www.naughtyduk.com/articles/humans-waste-682-years-per-day-on-cookie-notices)\n\n## Comment ID k63hzdu with +1 score by [(FredHerberts_Plant, Reddit, 2023-10-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17e9gyt/what_are_your_thoughts_on_cookie_compliance/k63hzdu/) (in reply to ID 17e9gyt):\n# WE LEAD THE WORLD IN COMPUTERIZED DATA COLLECTION!!!",

I'm a co-founder at VAYU, an end-to-end AI-enabled automated compliance platform that uses AI agents with designated roles to automate and scale compliance for frameworks like SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR, ISO, etc. My co-founders are cyber experts and full-stack ML engineers who've been through YC and experienced the time-consuming SOC2 & GDPR process. Our agents handle everything from defining & implement controls, automatically gathering evidence, and liaising with the auditors back and forth so you and your team doesn't need to (we have a large audit-network who we've negotiated price cuts with since we are also providing them with a touchless process). This saves you a lot of time, since we essentially offer you an entire AI security team to handle compliance. We'd love to hop on an initial call with you to educate you on what compliance frameworks your start-up even needs, the intricacies involved, and answer any questions you may have.

      "# Post ID x5wfo4: About HP trains with +49 score by [(pearl_khan, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/x5wfo4/about_hp_trains/)\nHello, \n\nFirst, I'm a new player and I'm honestly having a blast playing GW2. \n\nBtw to be more honest, I played the game for the first time 5 years ago... at this time I bought the HoT expansion and leveled a Elementalist to 80.. and that's It. I dropped the game after max lvl because I think I got overwhelmed and lost about what do to next. \n\nAfter Steam release, the game came to my radar once again and I decided to give another try and I'm having so much more fun now. I leveled another character (this time a Necromancer!!!) and now I'm facing the same walls again, but I'm not intending to give up like before. Since I'm not in a guild yet i'm relying on watching videos and read guides.\n\nBut one thing I'm really confused is about HP in expansion areas. I really want to unlock the Reaper but need a lot more HP to do so. I read the expansion areas gives u 10 points per challenge but they aren't soloable. Then I discovered about the HP trains that happens often on LFG. \n\nToday I saw one train on LFG but I was scared to join thinking this could be only for vets and their alts. So I'm here to ask for the next time I see one in LFG.\n\nThose trains usually accept new players or have any reqs besides Raptor and Gliding (I have both)? I need to have all waypoints in HoT unlocked before joining one in order to not be a burden and delay the others? Need to complete all the story there in advance? \n\nThanks and sorry for my bad english (it's not my first language).\n\nEDIT: After reading y'all comments here I got the courage to join into Aixxel The Defender train and got all HoT HPs. He was nice and patient for over 2 hours and this prob was one of the best experiences I've had in a MMO for a long time. Everyone running, dying and chatting was really fun.

A train that says \"only raptor/glider needed\" is a slow train where the conductor is going to make an effort to ensure everyone gets each HP via portals/other help. A \"Fast\" train assumes you have the mounts/masteries to keep up and general knowledge (eg you've done this several times, its just another alt) and from a POF perspective, a slow train is ~2h and a fast is ~45m.   \n  \nDoesn't hurt to say you're new and the train conductor will probably tell you whether it's a train you'll be able to keep up with.

Hero point trains are open to anyone, I’ve literally never seen an hp with any “requirements” in the sense that they kick you or anything like that. Some move fast so having raptor and gliding is needed just to keep up, but the commanders aren’t gonna kick you. It’s usually a very pleasant experience; you get to see everyone’s mounts and character’s fashion, and sometimes the chat is lively and funny.\n\nFor post-lvl 80 content to do, there’s a lot to pick from- there’s pvp, wvw, raids/strikes, story chapters, achievement or skin hunting… it’s impossible to focus on all of it at once, but the great thing about gw is that there’s no time limit.

Some may require \"base raptor and glider\" or some of the HP nodes will require a mastery to access.\n\nA good commander will call these out so you can hang back and not die due to environmental effects you can't bypass yet, but just ask what the base requirements are for the train and they can tell you if they didn't advertise what it was!\n\nI will say one downside to doing an HP Train is that when you're done and you max out your shiny new spec, you didn't do so gradually, so, you got a lot of new stuff to learn at once and consider.

Most hero points actually are soloable by a good chunk of the player base, but some are definitely hard enough you couldnt be faulted for not being able to do it. But it is within reason that once you're comfortable and more experienced (and properly geared) you could solo pretty much all HPs. Especially as this is your first elite spec. Remember after you've unlocked reaper, you can use it to do HPs in PoF or EoD if you later want to unlock harbinger or scourge. Not like you have to go back to core necro to do that.\n\nHP train squads usually have a squad message once you join that will give some details about when it starts, what is required,etc. Most HP trains are super casual (and thus very slow) but some are faster. But read the message,and leave if it doesn't match what you can do. For pretty much any open world content it's OK to ask questions. Maybe for stuff like raids yeah don't join a squad you don't know and randomly ask them what it is and what they're doing (tho tbh I feel like lots of parties would let you down politely)but for open world squads, give'er.\n\n## Comment ID in5ddtj with +1 score by [(Davosz_, Reddit, 2022-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/x5wfo4/about_hp_trains/in5ddtj/) (in reply to ID x5wfo4):\nThe people who run them will list what is required.

If you miss one, no stress, just move along to catch up with the group via the commanders tag.\n\nThe experience is very newbie friendly though.\n\nNote on glider and raptor. These are obtained at the start of the Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire xpacs respectively.

He is really passionate and it shows!\n\nI'd definitely recommend getting a day pass and making sure the place is a good fit as well. I am not the strongest guy around, but I've been a ton of gyms around here.  \n\nIron Religion/Power Strength and TFX are excellent gyms for bodybuilders and those focused on bodybuilding - you can definitely get strong at those gyms as well, but I'd put them more in the bodybuilding realm.\n\nThe Gym Downtown, Greed Island, and Orlando Barbell are all the powerlifting gyms.  Greed Island is awesome, but way too far, especially if the Gym Downtown is 8 minutes from you.  Orlando Barbell is old school and definitely has the credentials, but it definitely caters to an old school mentality overall.  The Gym Downtown, to me, caters to the new school of powerlifters.\n\nSpecial shoutout to the Weight House as well, i haven't been to their new spot, but they are also a good place to check out, and they are the home gym of the Osano training group, which are some of the nicest guys around.  One of their head coaches also trains at Gym Downtown.

It's about the mindset and approach of the leaders. I've never felt so empowered yet supported by everyone from my manager to my direct team members. The culture is very curious, not judgemental. This leads to really open discussions with diverse perspectives that result in great ideas and actionable plans. \n\nThe culture is also very family-first. Go to your son's fall festival, take time to see your parents, take a few days to help your sister move, step away to go pick up your kids. We all do it. \n\nOther pros include: \n- The company is on fire. It's in a rapidly growing space and we have the best product by far.\n- You get to work alongside people are who REALLY good at what they do. Sure, we're all still growing our crafts, but man have we hired some experts. \n- Everything is really well organized. From onboarding to IT requests, it's so well automated. \n- Transparent company OKRs help the company stay focused and aligned \n- Swag quality is top notch :)",

We all do it. \n\nOther pros include: \n- The company is on fire. It's in a rapidly growing space and we have the best product by far.\n- You get to work alongside people are who REALLY good at what they do. Sure, we're all still growing our crafts, but man have we hired some experts. \n- Everything is really well organized.

      "# [Data Privacy Laws: What You Need to Know in 2024 by Osano Staff on 2024-08-12](https://www.osano.com/articles/data-privacy-laws)\nVirtually every country has enacted some sort of data privacy law to regulate how information is collected, how data subjects are informed, and what control a data subject has over their information once it is transferred. Failure to follow applicable data privacy laws may lead to fines, lawsuits, and even prohibiting a site's use in certain jurisdictions. Navigating these laws and regulations can be daunting, but all website operators should be familiar with data privacy laws that affect their users.\n\nNew and Upcoming Data Privacy Laws in 2024\n\nIt's important to remain cognizant of existing data privacy laws, but perhaps you just want to review what's new in 2024 and beyond. Some of these laws are already in effect in 2024, will go into effect this year, or have relevant dates in the future.\n\nU.S. Data Privacy Laws\n\nDespite numerous proposals over the years, no one comprehensive federal law governs data privacy in the U.S. yet. As of this writing, the American Privacy Rights Act has been introduced in Congress. It still faces significant hurdles before it can ultimately be enacted into law, however.\n\nIn the meantime, however, individual states have acted rather than wait on the federal government. There's a complex patchwork of sector-specific and medium-specific laws, including laws and regulations that address telecommunications, health information, credit information, financial institutions, and marketing.\n\nThe FTC\n\nAn important enforcement agency in the U.S. is the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Its authority to regulate on behalf of consumer protections comes from The Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), which has broad jurisdiction over commercial entities under its authority to prevent unfair or \"deceptive trade practices.\"\n\nWhile the FTC uses its authority to issue regulations, enforce privacy laws, and take enforcement actions to protect consumers. For example, the FTC might take impose action against organizations that:\n\nFail to implement and maintain reasonable data security measures\n\nFail to abide by any applicable self-regulatory principles of the organization's industry\n\nFail to follow a published privacy policy\n\nTransfer personal information in a manner not disclosed in the privacy policy\n\nMake inaccurate privacy and security representations (i.e., lying) to consumers and in privacy policies\n\nFail to provide sufficient security for personal data\n\nViolate consumer data privacy rights by collecting, processing, or sharing consumer information\n\nEngage in misleading advertising practices\n\nOther federal laws that govern the collection of information online include:\n\nThe Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which governs the collection of information about minors\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act (HIPAA), which governs the collection of health information\n\nThe Gramm Leach Bliley Act (GLBA), which governs personal information collected by banks and financial institutions\n\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which regulates the collection and use of credit information\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which protects the privacy of student education records\n\nState Privacy Laws\n\nThe U.S. also has hundreds of sectoral data privacy and data security laws among its states. State attorneys general oversee data privacy laws governing the collection, storage, safeguarding, disposal, and use of personal data collected from their residents, especially regarding data breach notifications and the security of Social Security numbers. Some apply only to governmental entities, others to private entities, and others apply to both.\n\nIn addition to sectoral privacy laws, the U.S. is experiencing a massive drive toward pushing privacy legislation at the state level. That’s because the federal government hasn’t been able to find a consensus on how to legislate broadly. Rather than wait, state lawmakers have been nudged by consumers, consumer advocates, and even companies to set their own rules.\n\nOf course, companies would rather comply with a single federal standard than hire attorneys and privacy professionals, invest in compliance tools, and establish a robust compliance program that covers all applicable state laws. But states see the lack of any data privacy protections as more damaging than overly complex data privacy protections.\n\nStarting with 2023's state privacy laws and moving into 2024 and beyond, here’s a breakdown of where things stand.\n\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)\n\nThe most comprehensive state data privacy legislation to date is the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). The CPRA was passed by a ballot initiative in November 2020 and amended California’s previous state privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). It went into effect on January 1, 2023.\n\nThe CPRA is cross-sector legislation that introduces important definitions and broad individual consumer rights and imposes substantial duties on entities or persons that collect personal information about or from a California resident. These duties include informing data subjects when and how data is collected; allowing them to opt-out of data collection; allowing them to access, correct, and delete such information; and restricting how businesses can transfer personal information to other entities.\n\nMany of the above requirements were also included in the CCPA, but once the CPRA passed, the law was amended to include the following:\n\nRight to rectification: This updates and adds to a consumer’s right to correct inaccurate personal information.\n\nRight to restriction: This grants consumers the right to limit the use and disclosure of their sensitive personal information.\n\nSensitive personal information: This updates the definition of personal information. Certain types of information, like a consumer’s Social Security number, must be treated with special protections.\n\nThe CPRA also:\n\nIncreased fines for breaches of children’s data threefold\n\nExpanded breach liability beyond breaches of unencrypted data to disclosures of credentials (like an email address or password) that could lead to access to a consumer’s account\n\nLimited the duration of time a company may retain a consumer’s information to only what’s necessary and “proportionate” to the reason it was collected in the first place\n\nRequires companies working with third parties, contractors, and outside service providers to contractually mandate that those organizations exercise the same level of privacy protection to data shared with them as the first party\n\nOne of the most significant features of the CPRA is its enforcement. While state attorneys general typically handle privacy cases—unless the FTC is involved, and even then, it’s often a partnership—the CPRA establishes a new privacy regulator.\n\nThe California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) can fine transgressors, hold hearings about privacy violations, and clarify privacy guidelines. It’s a five-member board, and it starts enforcing six months after the CPRA goes into effect on July 1, 2023.\n\nVirginia's Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA)\n\nVirginia's Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA) was passed on March 2, 2021. It grants Virginia consumers certain rights over their data and requires companies covered by the law to comply with rules on the data they collect, how it's treated and protected, and with whom it's shared.\n\nThe law contains some similarities to the EU General Data Protection Regulation's (GDPR) provisions and the CPRA. It applies to entities that do business in Virginia or sell products and services targeted to Virginia residents and also meet one of the following:\n\nControl or process the personal data of 100,000 or more\n\nControl or process the personal data of at least 25,000 consumers and earn 50% of their revenue by selling personal information\n\nThe CDPA requires companies covered by the law to assist consumers in exercising their data rights by obtaining opt-in consent before processing their sensitive data (non-sensitive data may be collected so long as the consumer is notified), disclosing when their data will be sold, and allowing them to opt-out of data collection. It also requires companies to provide users with a clear privacy notice that enables consumers to opt-out of targeted advertising. In addition, it requires data brokers to honor consumers’ requests to opt out of data processing, among other requirements.\n\nThe CDPA went into effect on January 1, 2023.\n\nColorado Privacy Act (CPA)\n\nIn June 2020, Colorado became the third U.S. state to pass a privacy law. The Colorado Privacy Act grants Colorado residents rights over their data and places obligations on data controllers and processors. It contains some similarities to California's CPRA, Virginia's CDPA, and the EU’s GDPR.\n\nWhile there are similarities, such as some form of a right to opt-out, special protections for sensitive data, and the adoption of some privacy-by-design principles, the significant differences are in the details.\n\nThe CPA applies to businesses that collect personal data from 100,000 Colorado residents or collect data from 25,000 Colorado residents and derive revenue from the sale of that data.\n\nThe law lists five rights granted to Colorado residents once the law becomes effective on July 1, 2023. They are:\n\nThe right to opt-out of targeted ads, the sale of their personal data, or being profiled\n\nThe right to access the data a company has collected about them\n\nThe right to correct data that's been collected about them\n\nThe right to request the data collected about them is deleted\n\nThe right to data portability (that is, the right to take your data and move it to another company)\n\nThere are 17 blanket exemptions within the law. Data exemptions include:\n\nIf the data was collected for Colorado health insurance law purposes\n\nIf the entity collecting the data or the data collected is already covered by certain sectoral laws, including COPPA or the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\n\nIf the data has been de-identified or pseudonymized\n\nIf the data is being maintained and used by a consumer reporting agency\n\nIf the data is being used for employment records purposes\n\nSince the law goes into effect midway through 2023, businesses should expect updates to the law via rulemaking in the first half of the year.\n\nUtah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA)\n\nIn March 2022, Utah became the fourth state to enact a comprehensive consumer privacy law, which will take effect on December 31, 2023. The Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA) draws from the CDPA, CPA, and CPRA.\n\nThe law applies to both data controllers and processors that generate over $25 million in annual revenue and either:\n\nControl or process personal data for over 100,000 consumers yearly, or\n\nDerive over 50% of the entity’s gross revenue from the sale of personal data and controls or processes the personal data of 25,000 or more consumers.\n\nSimilarly to the statutes in Colorado and Virginia, there are exemptions for certain types of personal data; however, they’re broader at both the entity and data levels.\n\nThe law does not apply to governmental entities or third parties acting on behalf of a governmental entity, tribes, institutions of higher education, nonprofit corporations, business associates, information that meets the definition of protected health information for HIPAA and related regulations, and more.\n\nFinancial institutions governed by the GLBA (the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) and information in the FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act) also aren’t subject to the UCPA. Data processed or maintained in the course of employment is also exempt.\n\nConsumers have the right to:\n\nConfirm whether a controller is processing their personal data and accessing or deleting personal data provided\n\nObtain a copy of their personal data in a portable, accessible format\n\nOpt-out of processing of personal data for targeted advertising or sale\n\nIn contrast to the CDPA and CPA, the UCPA does not include the right to opt-out of profiling nor codify the right to correct inaccuracies in their data.\n\nConnecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA)\n\nConnecticut's fifth and most recent state to adopt a comprehensive consumer privacy law. Senate Bill 6, or “An Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring” (CTDPA), went into effect July 1, 2023.\n\nThe law also draws from Virginia and Colorado’s statutes, with a few departures. It applies to businesses that, during the preceding calendar year:\n\nControlled or processed personal data of 100,000 or more Connecticut residents, excluding residents whose personal data is controlled or processed solely to complete a payment transaction; or\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of not less than 25,000 consumers and derived more than 25% of their gross revenue from the sale of personal data.\n\nThe law is the first to specify that payment transaction data is not subject to the law, which is for small businesses that process information to complete a transaction, such as restaurants. Consumers can opt out of data processing for the purposes of targeted advertisements, sale to a third party, and profiling.\n\nThe state allows a 60-day period to remedy violations through December 31, 2024.\n\nMontana Consumer Data Privacy Act (MTCDPA)\n\nMontana Governor Greg Gianforte signed the Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act (MTCDPA) into law on May 19, 2023. However, the law does not go into effect until October 1, 2024.\n\nThe MTCDPA applies to any data controller that handles the personal data of at least 50,000 Montana residents, except for data used exclusively for payment transactions. Additionally, controllers that manage personal data from at least 25,000 consumers and derive more than 25% of their revenue from selling personal data also must comply with the law. Notably, there is no revenue threshold associated with the MTCDPA.\n\nUnder the law, Montanans have the right to opt out of the sale of their personal data, the right to know if a controller is processing their personal information and access to that data, the right to request the correction of inaccurate or outdated information, the right to ask a controller to delete their personal data, the right to portability, and the right to not be discriminated against for exercising their rights.\n\nThe MTCDPA includes the usual range of exemptions, including government agencies, nonprofits, higher education institutions, national securities associations registered under the Securities Exchange Act, organizations governed by GLBA, and organizations subject to HIPAA.\n\nOne of the more unique features of the law is that it doesn't specify a particular dollar amount for fines or other statutory damages for breaking the law. It simply states that the Attorney General can take legal action. Businesses will also have a 60-day cure period to address any violations, though this period expires April 1, 2026.\n\nTennessee Information Protection Act (TIPA)\n\nThe Tennessee Information Protection Act (TIPA), signed into law in May 2023 and effective from July 1, 2025, positions Tennessee among states taking proactive steps in consumer privacy. The TIPA applies to businesses exceeding $25 million in revenue that engage with Tennessee or its residents and either:\n\nControl or process the personal information of at least 175,000 consumers.\n\nControl or process the personal information of at least 25,000 consumers and derive more than 50 percent of gross revenue from the sale of personal information.\n\nConsumer rights under TIPA include the ability to confirm, access, correct, delete, and obtain personal information. The law places responsibilities on data controllers, emphasizing data minimization, security practices, and non-discrimination.\n\nIn contrast with other state laws, the TIPA provides a narrower applicability threshold, a generous two-plus-year on-ramp period for businesses, and an affirmative defense option for those with written privacy programs aligned with specified frameworks like NIST. In this circumstance, an affirmative defense helps protect businesses against liability. Because of these and other unique features, the TIPA is one of the more business-friendly U.S. privacy laws.\n\nEnforcement falls under the state attorney general, with a 60-day cure period for violators. Penalties may include fines up to $7,500 per violation, with the potential for tripled damages for willful violations.\n\nOregon Consumer Privacy Act (OCPA)\n\nThe Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (OCPA) represents Oregon's response to the absence of a federal privacy law. Signed into law in July 2023, the OCPA is set to become effective on July 1, 2024, concurrently with Texas's privacy law. The law applies to businesses conducting operations in Oregon or providing services to its residents and either:\n\nControl or process the personal data of 100,000 or more consumers.\n\nControl or process the personal data of 25,000 or more consumers while deriving a quarter or more of their annual gross revenue from selling personal data.\n\nNotable exemptions to the OCPA involve information governed by acts like HIPAA and GLBA like other state laws. However, the OCPA is distinct that entities subject to these acts must still comply with the OCPA for non-covered data. The law grants consumers the usual rights, including access, correction, deletion, and opt-out options for targeted advertising or profiling. Controllers must respond to requests within 45 days, extendable by an additional 45 days, and provide justification for any rejection.\n\nUnique features of the OCPA include its data-level exemptions for HIPAA and GLBA (as opposed to entity-level exemptions) and its broad definition of sensitive data. The OCPA includes the usual items under the umbrella of sensitive data, but also includes data types like an individual’s status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, and more.\n\nEnforcement falls under the state attorney general, with potential fines up to $7,500 per violation. Unlike some state laws, the OCPA incorporates a 30-day right to cure, a five-year statute of limitations, and provisions for additional fees if the attorney general prevails in an action.\n\nTexas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA)\n\nThe Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA), signed into law on June 18, 2023, by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, positions Texas as the second-largest state (after California) to enact a comprehensive data privacy law.\n\nUnique aspects of the TDPSA include a deviation from traditional applicability criteria, replacing revenue-based thresholds with a focus on businesses conducting operations in Texas and offer products or services consumed by Texas residents, or businesses that process or sell personal data. Notably, it introduces a novel small business provision, and while exclusions exist for entities such as state agencies and financial institutions, the law does not provide a general exemption for entities governed by HIPAA or GLBA, requiring compliance for non-covered data.\n\nConsumer rights granted by the TDPSA align with common privacy laws, allowing residents to confirm, correct, delete, and obtain copies of their personal data, along with opting out of targeted advertising or data sale. The law becomes enforceable on July 1, 2024, with businesses gaining a grace period until January 1, 2025, to comply with the global opt-out technology provision. A distinctive feature is the perpetual 30-day cure period, allowing violators to rectify breaches and avoid penalties by providing the attorney general with evidence of compliance.\n\nThe TDPSA introduces unique provisions, such as additional disclosures for companies selling sensitive or biometric information, and explicit notices for data sale on targeted advertising.\n\nThe law is enforceable by the state attorney general, who can issue fines of up to $7,500 per violation.\n\nIowa Consumer Data Protection Act (ICDPA)\n\nThe Iowa Consumer Data Protection Act (ICDPA) was signed into law in late March, 2023, by Governor Kim Reynolds, and goes into effect on January 1, 2025.\n\nThe ICDPA applies to businesses controlling or processing the personal data of at least 100,000 Iowa consumers or 25,000 consumers with over 50% of gross revenue from data sales. Exemptions include data regulated by the FCRA, state agencies, financial institutions under GLBA, and entities complying with HIPAA.\n\nConsumer rights under the ICDPA include confirmation of data processing, deletion rights, access to personal data, and the right to opt out of data sales. While similar to other state laws, ICDPA notably lacks explicit provisions for the right to correct personal data and the right to opt out of profiling. In response to consumers exercising their rights, the law sets a 90-day timeline for responses and requires businesses to provide information free of charge up to twice annually per consumer.\n\nEnforcement, managed by the state attorney general, incorporates a perpetual 90-day cure period for violators before fines of $7,500 per violation are imposed. The ICDPA does not grant a private right of action.\n\nIndiana Consumer Data Protection Act (INCDPA)\n\nThe Indiana Consumer Data Protection Act (INCDPA) became the seventh state to adopt a privacy law on May 1, 2023. Effective from January 1, 2026, the INCDPA follows the footsteps of similar state laws, emphasizing consumer rights and establishing guidelines for data safeguarding.\n\nThe INCDPA applies to businesses operating in Indiana or selling products and services to Indiana residents that control or process personal data of either 100,000 or 25,000 Indiana residents. Unlike other data privacy laws, the INCDPA doesn't solely rely on a revenue threshold, requiring compliance even if annual gross revenues fall below a specific limit.\n\nConsumer rights granted by the INCDPA include the ability to correct data inaccuracies; opt out of targeted advertising, data sales, or specific profiling; confirm data processing; and request the deletion of personal data. Exemptions exclude state entities, affiliates of financial institutions, organizations subject to HIPAA, non-profit entities, higher education institutions, and public utility entities. Controllers must adhere to principles like data minimization, implement security measures, and conduct data protection impact assessments (DPIA) for specific data processing activities. These include targeted advertising, data sale, profiling with foreseeable risks, processing of sensitive data, and other activities with heightened risk.\n\nEnforcement of the INCDPA involves a 30-day cure period for alleged violations before civil penalties of up to $7,500 per violation are imposed. The attorney general oversees enforcement and may grant injunctive relief. The law emphasizes a business-friendly approach, providing a substantial window for compliance preparation.\n\nDelaware Personal Data Privacy Act (DPDPA)\n\nDelaware joined the growing list of U.S. states enacting comprehensive data privacy legislation with the Delaware Personal Data Privacy Act (DPDPA), positioned as one of the nation's most robust data privacy bills. While California still holds the title for the strongest data privacy law, the DPDPA is notable for its consumer-friendly approach and broader applicability, encompassing businesses of varying sizes. Set to take effect on January 1, 2025, the law grants an additional year for businesses to implement universal opt-out mechanisms in 2026.\n\nApplicability under the DPDPA is extensive, covering any company conducting business in Delaware or offering products/services targeting state residents. The thresholds for compliance are set at processing the personal data of at least 35,000 consumers or 10,000 consumers with over 20% of gross revenue derived from personal data sales. Notably, the 35,000-consumer threshold is the lowest among existing data privacy laws, making the DPDPA applicable to a broader range of small and medium-sized companies.\n\nExemptions under the DPDPA include government bodies, financial institutions subject to the GLBA, and various types of data, such as protected health information under HIPAA. Consumer rights align with other state laws, encompassing the right to confirm and access personal data, correct inaccuracies, delete data, obtain data copies, receive a list of third-party disclosures, and opt-out of targeted advertising, data sale, or profiling. Controllers are obliged to limit data collection to what is necessary, implement security measures, and obtain opt-in consent for sensitive data or data of known children.\n\nEnforcement falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice, allowing a cure period for violators, albeit with a sunset provision ending on January 1, 2026. The Department may investigate and prosecute violations, potentially resulting in penalties up to $10,000 per violation. The law also mandates data protection assessments for activities with a heightened risk of harm to consumers, such as targeted advertising or processing sensitive data.\n\nNebraska Data Privacy Act (NDPA)\n\nThe Nebraska Data Privacy Act (NDPA) is a comprehensive data privacy act designed to protect consumers and give them control over their personal information. It grants them certain rights, outlined below, and provides controllers, or the entity that determines the purpose and means of processing personal data, with specific requirements for how to handle data and consumer requests related to their data.\n\nThe law’s scope tracks closely with the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA), including its applicability, sensitive data, and its requirement to honor universal opt-out mechanisms.\n\nLike the TDPSA, Nebraska’s privacy law applies to a person who:\n\nConducts business in the state or produces a product or service consumed by residents of Nebraska;\n\nProcesses or engages in the sale of personal data; and\n\nIs not a small business as determined under the federal Small Business Act.\n\nOne notable aspect of the NDPA’s applicability is that, unlike most other state laws, there is no revenue or volume of data processed.\n\nLike many other comprehensive data privacy laws, the state attorney general has enforcement authority of the data privacy act. The law stipulates that the attorney general must first notify the controller or processor of the violation in writing and provide a 30-day cure period—luckily for Nebraska businesses, this cure period does not sunset, unlike other state data privacy laws.\n\nIn addition to curing the violation, the controller or process must also provide a written statement and supportive documentation to show the violation was cured and stating that they will not commit another violation.\n\nThose who don’t cure a violation during the 30-day timeframe, or who breach their written statement, will be subject to a $7,500 fine for each infraction.\n\nNew Hampshire Privacy Act (NHPA)\n\nThe New Hampshire Privacy Act (NHPA) is one of a number of statewide data privacy laws aimed at giving consumers control over their personal data in an increasingly digital world.\n\nThe good news for businesses is that the NHPA largely resembles other data privacy laws that have come before it. It is most closely aligned to those in Virginia (VCDPA) and Connecticut (CTDPA)—though there are slight nuances.\n\nThe law is slated to take effect January 1, 2025, and will apply to “persons that conduct business” in the state or who produce products or services targeted to residents of New Hampshire and who, during a one-year period:\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of not less than 35,000 unique consumers, excluding if the processing occurred solely to complete a payment transaction, or\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of not less than 10,000 unique consumers and derived more than 25 percent of their gross revenue from the sale of personal data.\n\nThe New Hampshire data privacy act’s scope is somewhat unique in that it doesn’t include a revenue threshold. Additionally, the applicability threshold is lower than other laws, but lawmakers have pointed out that this is because of the state’s lower population.\n\nLike other U.S. laws, the NHPA follows primarily an opt-out model, meaning businesses are free to process consumer data, but must notify consumers about the processing first and give them a way to opt out of the collection or sale of data. There are exceptions, however, for the data of children under the age of 13 and for sensitive data. Here, opt-in permission is required.\n\nOther notable provisions include:\n\nThe NHPA will require businesses to recognize universal opt-out mechanisms, such as the Global Privacy Control.\n\nThe act has a 60-day cure period for violations that sunsets one year after the law is enacted (in January 2026).\n\nNew Jersey Data Privacy Act (NJDPA)\n\nThe New Jersey Data Protection Act (NJDPA) is a data privacy law that gives New Jersey residents control over their personal data, providing certain rights and imposing obligations on those who control and process consumer data. The law applies to businesses and entities who conduct business in the state or who produce products or services targeted to those who live in New Jersey.\n\nIn terms of applicability and exemptions, New Jersey’s privacy law aligns with other state laws. It applies to controllers who, during a calendar year, meet one of the following criteria:\n\nControl or process the personal data of at least 100,000 consumers, excluding personal data processed solely for the purpose of completing a payment transaction, or\n\nControl or process the personal data of at least 25,000 consumers and the controller derives revenue or receives a discount on the price of any goods or services, from the sale of personal data.\n\nThere are a few key definitions in the law: the NJDPA defines “sale” as “sharing, disclosing, or transferring” data for money or other valuable consideration, similar to California’s law. A “controller” is an individual or legal entity that determines the purpose and means of processing personal data.\n\nSimilar to Colorado’s privacy law, it doesn’t define a specific percentage of revenue that must be derived from the sale of data, whereas other states have implemented a 25 or 50 percent threshold.\n\nThe law goes into effect in January 15, 2025, one year after its enactment.\n\nKentucky Consumer Data Protection Act (KCDPA)\n\nThe Kentucky Consumer Data Protection Ac (KCDPA) provides data privacy protections for consumers of the Bluegrass State, granting them certain, now standard rights. We’ll dive into more on that later.\n\nThe law defines consumers as residents of the state acting only as an individual, not in commercial or employment contexts. It closely aligns with Virginia’s law, which is good news for businesses already complying with the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA). And, because the VCDPA is considered a framework or foundation legislation, the KCDPA also tracks closely with other state laws that used Virginia’s law as a framework, including Tennessee and Indiana.\n\nBusinesses will become subject to the law as of January 1, 2026.\n\nSimilar to Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Indiana, Kentucky’s privacy act allows companies to collect and process most types of personal information without obtaining affirmative user consent first (in most cases). This is known as the opt-out model, which most U.S. data privacy laws follow.\n\nJust like Virginia’s law, the KCDPA applies to any person who conducts business in Kentucky or who produces products or services that target residents of the state, and during a calendar year controls or processes data of at least:\n\n100,000 consumers; or\n\n25,000 consumers and derives over 50 percent of gross revenue from the sale of personal data.\n\nLike all data privacy laws that came before it, the KCDPA applies to both controllers, or entities who determine the purpose and means of processing data, and processors, or entities that process personal data on behalf of a controller, such as a third-party vendor charged with analyzing data. The delineation between controllers and processors exists to clearly assign responsibilities for data governance between the parties involved in collecting and processing consumer data.\n\nMinnesota Consumer Data Privacy Act (MCDPA)\n\nThe MCDPA is a state-level legislation designed to safeguard the personal data of Minnesota residents. Rather than permit organizations to collect, process, and generally do whatever they wish with consumers’ personal information, data privacy regulations like the MCDPA:\n\nSet limits on what organizations can do with personal data\n\nRequire organizations to meet certain obligations, like setting safeguards, assessing for risk, and respecting consumer rights\n\nProvide consumers with data privacy rights that enable them to maintain control over their personal information\n\nOfficially enacted on May 24, 2024, the MCDPA will take effect on July 31, 2025. Once that happens, businesses will need to comply or potentially suffer penalties and fines from the state Attorney General.\n\nThe MCDPA applies to organizations that provide products or services targeted at Minnesotans and meet one of the following criteria:\n\nDuring a calendar year, they control or process the personal data of 100,000 consumers or more.\n\nThey derive more than 25 percent of gross revenue from the sale of personal data and process or control personal data of 25,000 consumers or more.\n\nAs is the case with most data privacy laws, the definition of “sale” includes both selling data for money and “other valuable considerations.”\n\nMaryland Online Data Privacy Act (MODPA)\n\nThe MODPA gives Maryland residents more control over how companies collect and use their personal data online. With an effective date of October 1, 2025, the new law establishes data protection rights and requires companies that track or target the state’s residents to meet stricter requirements around data collection—especially related to data minimization, consent, universal opt-out mechanisms, sensitive data, and children’s data. However, MODPA will not apply to companies’ data processing activities until April 1st, 2026.\n\nWhile it is an opt-out law (meaning consumers have the right to opt-out of processing data for certain purposes) Maryland’s privacy act is already known in the data privacy world as more stringent than many other state laws.\n\nMaryland’s privacy law applies to anyone who conducts business in the state, as well as those who provide services or products targeted to residents of Maryland and during the prior calendar year either:\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of at least 35,000 consumers, with the exception of personal data collected or processed solely for completing a payment transaction, or:\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of at least 10,000 consumers and derived more than 20 percent of its gross revenue from the sale of personal data.\n\nWith controller requirements and restrictions, the MODPA gets tricky. It differs from other state laws in a few key areas.\n\nIn Maryland, controllers are restricted from the collection, processing, and sharing of sensitive data, except where it’s strictly necessary to provide or maintain a specific product or service requested by the consumer.\n\nWhat’s more, controllers are banned altogether from selling sensitive data.\n\nThe Maryland Office of the Attorney General's Consumer Protection Division enforces the MCPA, which has fines of up to $10,000 per violation or $25,000 for each repetition of the same violation.\n\nThe Rhode Island Data Transparency and Privacy Protection Act (RIDTPPA)\n\nEnacted June 29, 2024, the RIDTPPA resembles many other US data privacy laws, including its requirements surrounding consent, sensitive personal information processing, and consumer rights. The law, however, does feature several important differences.\n\nNotably, the law also lacks a cure period. If you’re found to have violated the law, you’ll simply be fined without any grace period to fix the violation. Most state data privacy laws feature cure periods, though some expire at various dates in the future, and some are permanent features.\n\nThe law also does not require businesses to honor universal opt-out mechanisms.\n\nIf your organization is a for-profit entity and conducts business in Rhode Island or provides products or services targeted to Rhode Islanders, you may be subject to the RIDTPPA.\n\nSpecifically, you must meet the above criteria as well as one of the following:\n\nYour organization controlled or processed at least 35,000 state residents’ personal data.\n\nYour organization controlled or processed at least 10,000 state residents’ personal data and derived more than 20% of its gross revenue from the sale of that data.\n\nThere are exemptions, of course, but if you meet the above criteria, you likely will need to comply with the law.\n\nNew York SHIELD Act\n\nIn July 2019, New York passed the Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security (SHIELD) Act. This law amends New York's existing data breach notification law and creates more data security requirements for companies that collect information on New York residents. As of March 2020, the law is fully enforceable.\n\nThis law broadened the scope of consumer privacy and provides better protection for New York residents from data breaches of their personal information. It requires employers in possession of the New York residents’ private information to “develop, implement, and maintain reasonable safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the private information.”\n\nLast year, in 2022, the state Attorney General settled with an organization $600,000 for failing to meet minimum standards that led to a breach in security and a leak of personal information. While there have been no recent updates to the law, it is still very active and enforced, as shown by this settlement.\n\nCheck out our U.S. data privacy laws guide for a detailed summary.\n\nEuropean Data Privacy Laws\n\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation remains the law of the land, but new data privacy-related laws have been passed in the EU recently—notably, the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. Here's a refresher on the GDPR and a list of the other laws you should track to keep your organization up-to-date on data privacy in 2024.\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n\nThe most crucial data protection legislation enacted to date is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It governs the collection, use, transmission, and security of data collected from residents of any of the 28 member countries of the European Union. The law applies to all EU residents, regardless of the entity's location that collects the personal data. Fines of up to € 20 million or 4% of total global turnover may be imposed on organizations that fail to comply with the GDPR. Some essential requirements of the GDPR include:\n\nConsent\n\nData subjects must be allowed to give explicit, unambiguous consent before the collection of personal data. Personal data includes information collected through the use of cookies. Some information not usually considered \"personal information\" in the United States, such as the user's computer IP address, is considered to be \"personal data\" according to the GDPR.\n\nData Breach Notification\n\nOrganizations must notify supervisory authorities and data subjects within 72 hours if a data breach affects users' personal information in most cases.\n\nData Subjects' Rights\n\nData subjects (people whose data is collected and processed) have certain rights regarding their personal information. These rights should be communicated to data subjects in a clear, easy-to-access privacy policy on the organization's website.\n\nThe right to be informed. Data subjects must be informed about the collection and use of their personal data when the data is obtained.\n\nThe right to access their data. A data subject can request a copy of their personal data via a data subject request. Data controllers must explain the means of collection, what's being processed, and with whom it is shared.\n\nThe right of rectification. If a data subject's data is inaccurate or incomplete, they have the right to ask you to rectify it.\n\nThe right of erasure. Data subjects have the right to request the erasure of personal data related to them on certain grounds within 30 days.\n\nThe right to restrict processing. Data subjects have the right to request the restriction or suppression of their personal data (though you can still store it).\n\nThe right to data portability. Data subjects can have their data transferred from one electronic system to another at any time safely and securely without disrupting its usability.\n\nThe right to object. Data subjects can object to how their information is used for marketing, sales, or non-service-related purposes. The right to object does not apply where legal or official authority is carried out, a task is carried out for public interest, or when the organization needs to process data to provide you with a service for which you signed up.\n\nDigital Services Act (DSA)\n\nThe new regulation addresses illegal and harmful content by compelling platforms such as Google and Facebook to remove content that doesn’t meet certain standards. The primary principle is “what is illegal offline must be illegal online,” according to the Council of the EU. The Digital Services Act (DSA) entered into force on November 16, 2022. Different provisions of the law will become effective at different times, with the law coming fully into force on February 17, 2024.\n\nIt applies to four categories of businesses:\n\nIntermediary services offering network infrastructure, such as ISPs\n\nHosting services, such as cloud and web-hosting services\n\nOnline platforms that bring sellers and consumers together, such as online marketplaces, social platforms, and app stores\n\nVery large online platforms, which are defined as online platforms that reach more than 10% of the 450 million consumers in Europe\n\nEach category faces different requirements.\n\nAll of the above categories must:\n\nEngage in transparency reporting on court orders and actions taken, content moderation efforts, and more\n\nUpdate terms of service to account for fundamental rights\n\nCooperate with national authorities\n\nEstablish points of contact for authorities and, when necessary, legal representatives\n\nHosting services, online platforms, and very large online platforms must:\n\nProvide a notice-and-action mechanism enabling users to note potential illegal content for the business to remove\n\nReport criminal offenses\n\nOnline platforms and very large platforms must:\n\nImplement a complaint and redress mechanism\n\nIdentify trusted flaggers whose expertise adds special weight to their content notices\n\nTake measures against abusive notices and counter-notices\n\nIf they have a marketplace feature, take special actions, such as vetting third-party suppliers’ credentials, adhering to compliance-by-design principles, and more\n\nNot target advertisements to children or target advertisements based on users’ special characteristics\n\nProvide transparency into content recommendation systems\n\nProvide user-facing transparency into online advertising practices\n\nVery large platforms must:\n\nAdopt risk management practices and establish crisis response protocols\n\nAcquiesce to external, independent auditing, establish an internal compliance function, and be publicly accountable\n\nProvide users the choice to not be subject to content recommendations based on profiling\n\nShare data with authorities and researchers\n\nAdhere to self-drafted codes of conduct\n\nCooperate with authorities during crisis response situations\n\nEU data protection authorities may access, obtain information from, and inspect service providers to inform orders and sanctions. If a business is found to be in violation, it may be fined up to 6% of annual global turnover during the preceding financial year. If an information obligation under the DSA is violated, the maximum penalty is limited to 1% of the previous year’s income or global turnover.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act (DMA)\n\nComing into effect March 2024, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) covers the largest digital platforms, known as “gatekeepers,” which include companies like Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, and Google. The DMA aims to level the playing field for digital companies and prevent gatekeeper companies from imposing unfair conditions on their competitors. For example, a company like Amazon isn’t allowed to rank products on its site in a way that gives Amazon’s own products and services an advantage.\n\nA company is considered a gatekeeper if it:\n\nHas a strong economic position, significant impact on the EU market, and is active in multiple EU member states\n\nHas a strong position as an intermediary linking a large user base to a large number of businesses\n\nHas or will soon have an entrenched position in the market, which is determined by whether or not the company met the two previous criteria in the last three financial years\n\nUnder the DMA, businesses that qualify as gatekeepers must:\n\nNot engage in self-preferencing, where the gatekeeper promotes their own products and services over an equivalent third-party product or service on the gatekeeper’s platform\n\nNot reuse users’ data outside of the context in which it was originally collected without consent\n\nNot track users outside of the gatekeepers’ platform for the purpose of targeted advertising without consent\n\nPermit communication and content access between businesses and end users\n\nEnsure price and fee transparency in advertising intermediation services\n\nProvide access to marketing or advertising performance data on the platform to users\n\nMake it easy for users to change their default settings and uninstall software\n\nEnsure third-party technology can interoperate with the gatekeeper’s own\n\nEnsure end users’ data is portable to other systems\n\nProvide businesses with real-time access to their data on the gatekeeper’s platform\n\nNot prevent users from making complaints to authorities\n\nNot require user registration to additional services as a condition of accessing a given service\n\nNot use businesses’ non-public data to compete against them\n\nAnd more\n\nGatekeepers that violate the DMA may be subject to fines of up to 10% of annual global turnover or up to 20% in the case of repeated violations. What’s more, repeated violations may result in non-financial remedies, such as forced divestitures.\n\nThe EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework\n\nAlthough it isn't a law per se, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework is an important factor to be aware of.\n\nPreviously, businesses transferring EU citizens’ data into the U.S. relied on a framework called the Privacy Shield to ensure the data was sufficiently protected, but that framework was deemed invalid during the Schrems II court case. This forced businesses to rely on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission to provide legal protection for data transfers.\n\nHowever, these clauses are somewhat shaky, which is why there was pressure to get a replacement for the Privacy Shield stood up.\n\nOn July 10, 2023, the new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework went into effect. It includes additional security measures, a redress mechanism for EU and U.S. citizens who feel their rights have been violated, and greater protections for foreign citizens’ data that has been transferred to the U.S. Additionally, the framework requires intelligence agencies to make updates to surveillance-related policies and procedures, followed by a review by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.\n\nWhile the framework improves upon the Privacy Shield, it's not without its flaws. There will likely be criticisms from European privacy advocacy groups, but if the framework survives, it could be the method businesses use to transfer data between the EU and U.S.\n\nThe EU AI Act\n\nThe EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act was approved on 16 June 2023 and is expected to go into effect sometime in late 2025 or early 2026. It applies to any company doing business in the EU that develops or adopts “high-risk” AI systems. These systems affect employment, credit, health care, and other critical domains.\n\nThe EU AI Act applies extraterritorially, meaning the law will cover companies based elsewhere if they have customers or users inside the EU, effectively making it a global regulation.\n\nUnder the Act, businesses with applicable AI systems have to:\n\nConduct impact assessments, keep records, and meet transparency obligations\n\nNot develop systems that can be used to manipulate a person’s behavior in a manner that could cause mental or physical harm.\n\nNot develop systems that can be used to exploit the vulnerabilities of a specific group due to their age, physical or mental disabilities, or behavior in a manner that could cause psychological or physical harm.\n\nNot develop systems that could exploit vulnerable groups based on age, or physical or mental disability.\n\nNot develop systems that provide real-time remote biometric data in publicly accessible spaces by law enforcement.\n\nOther International Data Privacy Laws\n\nWith over 130 data privacy laws across the globe, it isn’t feasible to list and describe each and every one in this blog post. However, here are some important regulations that may apply to your business.\n\nBrazil’s General Law for the Protection of Personal Data, or the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD): This law came into effect in 2020 and contains many similar provisions to the GDPR. Learn more about the law in our dedicated blog article, The definitive guide to Brazil's privacy law, the LGPD.\n\nCanada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA): PIPEDA was assented to in 2000, came into full force in 2004, and was considered a progressive law at the time. It was last updated in 2015 by the Data Privacy Act but still falls short of the GDPR’s regulatory standard.\n\nChina’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL): PIPL was enacted into law in November of 2021 and broadly maps to the GDPR’s stipulations. However, it does vary in some of its details, notably by giving individuals fewer rights, requiring a stricter standard for consent, and imposing harsher penalties.\n\nIndia's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA): Significantly, this law covers all of India's 1.4 billion people. While the law broadly mirrors the GDPR, it includes some variation, notably in the form of government exemptions.\n\nReduce Complexity and Risk With a Compliance Platform",

      "# [4 Ways Privacy in Business Generates ROI](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/4-ways-privacy-in-business-generates-roi-5137528/)\nModern businesses have to be compliant with data privacy regulations. Everyone knows that.\n\nBut nobody likes being told they have to do something. Especially not when that something seems like an expensive, complicated distraction from revenue-generating activities.\n\nGood news: A data privacy program can be so much more than a simple cost center. It isn't just something that you have to do; it's something smart businesses will want to do (assuming you’re interested in generating revenue).\n\nInvesting in privacy is a wise strategic move that can provide a significant return on investment (ROI). In fact, estimates on the ROI of data privacy reach up to $2.7 return for every $1 spent. Here are four ways you’ll generate a return by investing in data privacy.\n\nStronger Brands with More Customer Trust\n\nMcKinsey reports that 71% of consumers surveyed would stop doing business with a company if it mishandled their sensitive data. A separate study from the Pew Research Center found that 52% of consumers actually have stopped buying from a company due to privacy concerns, showing that consumers aren’t just paying lip service to how much they care about data privacy.\n\nMoney saved is money earned—but can privacy generate additional customer trust, and does that trust translate into more revenue? Consider this: Sixty percent of consumers indicated they would spend more with brands they trust to protect their data. Research from Google found that 49% of participants would switch away from their first-choice brand if they had a positive privacy experience with their second-choice brand.\n\nEven if you don’t find statistics compelling, it’s undeniable that some companies have chosen to make data privacy a part of their brand. Apple, for instance, considers privacy a “core value” and has made data privacy a key differentiator. Given that 81% of Americans have expressed concern over how businesses use their data, it’s no surprise that Apple’s recent product rollouts have all mentioned privacy in one way or another.\n\nMore Effective Marketing\n\nA common objection to robust data privacy practices is that it’ll reduce the marketing team’s access to data, and therefore its effectiveness. In fact, the opposite is true.\n\nBusinesses that attempt to “trick” consumers into handing over their data through dark patterns do get more data. But the bulk of that data will be inaccurate or generate bad leads from consumers that never wanted to be contacted in the first place. (Not to mention manipulating consumers to provide their data is noncompliant).\n\nResearch has shown that customers who feel in control of their data during interactions with a given business are twice as likely to find advertising relevant and are three times more likely to react positively to advertising.\n\nConsumers aren’t against advertising and marketing. They just don’t want to feel deceived or tricked. Ultimately, consumers want to be in the loop about what you’re doing with their information. Once they know that, they’ll be far more responsive to your marketing campaigns.\n\nConsolidated IT\n\nFifty-six percent of applications used within companies are not owned or approved by IT. With the accessibility of SaaS solutions, it’s simply not feasible to ensure every tool gets vetted and approved by IT first. Employees and teams will find their own solutions to problems rather than wait on lengthy procurement processes.\n\nThis is a huge issue, both in terms of security and data privacy.\n\nBut robust data privacy practices can help in the discovery of shadow IT and provide insight into data risk in these applications. Businesses that emphasize data privacy are more likely to make employees aware of the risks of sending personal information to unvetted applications.\n\nIn addition, data privacy solutions often enable you to map the data and systems controlled by your organization. When you map your data in this way, you’ll gain visibility into shadow IT systems as well as potentially redundant or unneeded systems. As a result, you’ll be able to help IT streamline the tech stack and reduce the risk of data vulnerability or noncompliance.\n\nRisk Mitigation\n\nSpeaking of reduced risk, one of the headline benefits of a data privacy program is risk mitigation. In the long run, risk is a cost—eventually there will be a breach or an incident, and that event will cost money to react to and recover from and will cost the business in reputational damage. Proactive risk mitigation is a cost-saver by its very nature.",

The students were part of a larger group of eleven student researchers from six universities, who also presented at the conference as part of the research team that works with Bowie State biology professor Dr. Anne Osano. The students worked together to prepare for the opportunity to have their research examined by industry professionals.\n\n“They can explain to the community what they did and why it’s important,” said Dr. Osano. “You have students from all over the nation, and they’re competing in their research.”\n\nERN is a national conference with participation from universities across the nation. The conference is aimed at university undergraduate and graduate students who participate in programs funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The objectives of the conference are to help undergraduate and graduate students to enhance their science communication skills and to better understand how to prepare for science careers in a global workforce.\n\nDr. Osano was thrilled to have so many of her students’ abstracts accepted at this latest conference. Bowie State’s participation not only highlights the university as a quality research institution, but the process of getting research accepted also boosts the students’ professional profile once they make it through the rigorous process.\n\n“They become even more competitive when they’re looking for a job,” said Dr. Osano. “The job market knows this is a good candidate if they can do research, present it and convince someone that ‘Hey, I have something important here.’”\n\n###",
      "# [“Science-policy diplomacy:” international experts tackle multilateralism and environmental governance during Climate Week on 2024-10-09](https://macmillan.yale.edu/stories/science-policy-diplomacy-international-experts-tackle-multilateralism-and-environmental)\nHow can policymakers balance global climate agreements with local conditions? How can scientists shape policy?\n\nIn a panel convened by the MacMillan Center for International & Area Studies, three experts sat down to tackle these questions on September 25 during Yale @ Climate Week NYC.\n\nDr. Maria Ivanova, Director of the Northeastern University School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs, led a conversation with Carlos Alvarado Quesada, former President of Costa Rica, and Philip Osano, Director of the Africa Centre of the Stockholm Environment Institute, in a talk titled “Flipping the Model: Leveraging Academic Perspectives to Reinvent Multilateralism.” Ivanova, M.E.M ’99, M.A. ’99, Ph.D ’06, began the panel by emphasizing the importance of mentorship across generations.\n\nIvanova writes and researches extensively on international institutions and environmental governance. She highlighted the growth of the Global Environmental Governance (GEG) Project — which she co-founded with Dan Esty JD ‘86, the Hillhouse Professor of Environmental Law and Policy, while she was a master’s student at Yale in the late 1990s.\n\n“We all stand on the shoulders of someone who’s been there before us,” Ivanova said.\n\nIvanova specifically named Philip Osano, who was one of the youth leaders selected by the GEG Project years ago and now leads mentorship programs in Kenya.\n\nOsano discussed the disconnect between different generations as there are inadequate mechanisms for younger people to be involved in decision-making. Despite the disproportionate impacts of climate change on African countries, there is a shortage of African scientists featured in major climate reports, especially young scientists, Osano said. To fill this gap, Osano supports programs that link young African scientists with older mentor figures.\n\nThe Role of Science in Policymaking\n\nMuch of the discussion focused on the role of “science-policy diplomacy,” emphasizing the role scientists can play in policymaking arenas and the possible synergies between the two disciplines to respond to the climate crisis.\n\nOsano, who has studied and worked in over a dozen countries, argued that this is a time when faith in science is declining in policymaking globally.\n\n“It’s critical that we find a way to bring science back to the center,” he said.\n\nCarlos Alvarado Quesada, who won several awards for his climate leadership while serving as President of Costa Rica from 2018-2022, acknowledged the frustration that exists over climate inaction. Alvardo posited that scientists must be able to understand the other existing issues linked to their specialty. By recognizing the other issues policymakers are considering, he argued, scientists can find a way to influence the policy sphere through \"reading” the wider room.\n\nOne major theme for the panel was what role scientists should play within institutions. Alvarado recalled that scientific arguments for expansive protection of ocean and land resources contributed to the motivation for Costa Rica to adopt the Biodiversity 30x30 goal in 2021, an initiative that was considered impossible just a few years before.\n\n“We need to shift from scaling methods to scaling impact,” Alvarado said.\n\nOsano underscored that scientists and policymakers often have to establish trust, which can be a lengthy process, and that scientists play a difficult role in sometimes having to be the person who communicates a message policymakers may not want to hear. Osano also emphasized how many impactful decisions are made in short periods of time, and then can take years to reverse.\n\nContradictions of Scale\n\nCarlos Alvarado now researches small state diplomacy in addition to teaching at the Tufts University Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy as a Professor of Practice of Diplomacy.\n\nWhile small states lack expansive resources, Alvarado emphasized their potential agility in responding to the climate crisis. Drawing on his experience governing Costa Rica, Alvarado noted how reports indicating that decarbonization would bring net benefits to the nation’s economy created synergistic evidence for climate policies despite fears of economic losses.\n\nAlvarado argued that the lack of trust and knowledge sharing across large states or blocs of power limits the ability of scientists to advance the implications of their data.\n\n“How do you measure trust?” Alvarado said. “Smaller countries are more likely to trust each other and share data. Bigger countries do not trust one another and do not share.”\n\nOsano echoed this point, noting that before cooperation can happen, nations have to believe that scientific data will not serve to their disadvantage.\n\nBuilding on her expertise in global environmental governance and the United Nations system, Ivanova reinforced the key points that our current approaches to multilateral collaboration have not been effective, and that there is a need to pivot to a fresh set of tactics that build trust, mobilize coalitions of the willing, and set aside ego.",

Celebrating individual wins as wins for the team, open and active knowledge sharing and making time for team-building activities lay the groundwork for a sales team that benefits from the healthy side of competition culture without experiencing any of the negative side effects.\n\nBy building an inclusive team culture, these teams are capitalizing on belonging in the workplace — which has a direct effect on productivity. According to a study from BetterUp, a culture of belonging in a workplace can lead to a 56 percent increase in employee performance. When employees feel they are in the right place and working with the right people, they tend to deliver their best work.\n\nBuilt In had the opportunity to speak with 15 sales reps across the country to hear what they love about their sales team — and the culture that supports their shared success.\n\nAlexander Keast\n\nSenior Account Executive • Qualtrics\n\nQualtrics creates software that helps brands deliver exceptional frontline experiences, build high-performing teams and design products people love.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day?

I joined from SAP, and having worked with Qualtrics before, I had a great impression of the people I would work with.\n\nQualtrics has a fantastic culture, especially in our U.K. office in London. There’s a strong sense of teamwork and collaboration towards common goals. What excites anyone about going to work is collaborating with intelligent people, serving engaged clients, solving problems for those clients and moving the business forward — all in an open manner. I get along well with everyone in this office, and that’s what it’s all about.\n\n“I get along well with everyone in this office, and that’s what it’s all about.”\n\nIn terms of how this sales team is different, it comes down to management and the culture that cascades through the management chain. My boss Andrew is extremely thoughtful and patient. There’s little hierarchy between us, allowing for collaboration and support on deals. Having a collaborative boss who adds value to how you work and helps you grow is a big difference at Qualtrics, with the recognition that things take time and you’re given that time to develop.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nWe have a good team culture. Sales professionals can sometimes prioritize individual competition over collaboration, which may lead to unintended negative behaviors. However, within our team, we genuinely help and support each other. For example, I’m currently helping two colleagues who are on holiday. We truly make an effort to assist one another, and that stems from hiring the right people who fit this culture.\n\nWe all share valuable insights from our customer conversations, and we recently had a team-building activity in Dublin, which was a lot of fun. We celebrate our successes, and it really comes from having a supportive manager who fosters a culture of collaboration.\n\nIf I were to describe this to a friend looking to apply, I’d say it’s a supportive environment with great people who you might enjoy spending time with outside of work.\n\nWhat are the perks like for sales folks?\n\nSales is a risk-reward function; the rewards can be great, but the risks are high. While I haven’t made the President’s Club at Qualtrics specifically, I’ve made it at other companies. I’d summarize Qualtrics by saying it’s a supportive culture with great people, where you can have fun while you work. Plus, there are the usual perks, like going to the President’s Club or our sales kickoff in Vegas last year which is a fun highlight.\n\nDarrin Cowie\n\nAccount Manager • DFIN\n\nDFIN offers end-to-end risk and compliance solutions through a suite of software solutions.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is DFIN’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nThere really is no one thing that makes me excited to come to work every day. It is a culmination of a couple of key items.\n\nFirst and foremost, interacting with my clients on a daily basis brings me much joy. The clients that I support are by and large happy with the DFIN partnership they have chosen and are always open to learning about how I can make their lives just a little bit easier. The job of reporting a company’s financials to the SEC is undoubtedly very stressful and often thankless, so I try to look for “operational efficiencies” that I can bring to my clients every day that will make their job a little easier during peak filing periods.\n\nThe culture and people at DFIN are also big differentiators from businesses that I have worked for in the past.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nThe sales culture at DFIN is one that is supportive of one another and inclusive and welcoming of diverse opinions and thoughts. Our team is extremely support and truly interested in each other’s successes — always willing to lend a colleague a helping hand knowing that they will better themselves by doing so.\n\n“The sales culture at DFIN is one that is supportive of one another and inclusive and welcoming of diverse opinions and thoughts.”\n\nThe DFIN sales team is also fortunate to have a large number of legacy sales professionals who have been working within the financial industry for a very long time.\n\nWhat I am most impressed with is the concerted effort that is made by the business to hire sales professionals from outside the industry with a wide range of backgrounds and experiences to draw from. The diversity that has been brought into the sales team has prompted the organization to look at things differently and challenge the status quo. Having the courage to not do something simply because “that’s the way we have always done it” has given the space for the organization to grow and thrive into the future.\n\nWhat are the perks like for sales folks?\n\nDFIN is an organization that believes in and encourages work-life balance. After the Covid-19 pandemic, we all found ourselves in a world where the line between work life and home life is often blurred — dogs barking in the background during conference calls, Amazon deliveries being delivered mid-day, your child needing to be picked up from school because of an early dismissal, etc.\n\nDFIN is proud to offer its associates an unlimited amount of paid time off in order to help better balance the personal and professional responsibilities that are required of all of us. Additionally, DFIN offers a fair and competitive compensation plan that rewards its associates for the right types of sales behaviors and significantly increases commission payouts for overachievement.\n\nFlorence Guyot\n\nArea VP – Southern Europe • Nexthink\n\nNexthink helps IT teams around the world modernize the digital employee experience.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Nexthink’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nEvery day, I wake up with a sense of anticipation and enthusiasm, eager to step into my management role with the sales team. This excitement is fueled by several key factors that make my job not just a profession but a passion.\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of working with this sales team is the collaborative and supportive environment we foster. On this sales team, there’s a strong emphasis on personal and professional development through continuous learning and growth. We also work with a clear vision and purpose. We are not just selling products; we are providing solutions that genuinely help our clients achieve their goals. This sense of purpose adds meaning to my work, knowing that what I do has a positive impact on others. We are encouraged to think outside the box, experiment with new approaches, and leverage the latest technology to improve our efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, a significant motivator for me is the recognition and reward. Hard work and dedication do not go unnoticed here. Whether it’s a simple acknowledgment in a team meeting, kudos or tangible rewards, there is an appreciation for effort here.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nWhen describing the culture of our sales team to a friend, the first thing that comes to mind is the word “inclusive.” Our team is more than just a group of colleagues — we’re a community that thrives on diversity, collaboration and shared success. The atmosphere here is incredibly collaborative. We genuinely work together to achieve our goals, rather than competing against one another. One of the things that truly sets our team apart is how much we enjoy celebrating our successes. Whether it’s hitting a major sales milestone, closing a big deal or even just making it through a tough week, we make it a point to celebrate. These celebrations range from casual after-work get-togethers to more organized events like team lunches, outings or themed office parties. It’s all about recognizing hard work and making sure everyone feels appreciated.\n\n“Our team is more than just a group of colleagues — we’re a community that thrives on diversity, collaboration and shared success.”\n\nWhat are the perks like for sales folks?\n\nThe compensation package for our sales team is highly competitive. It includes a strong base salary complemented by an attractive commission structure that rewards high performance. As growth is a key part of our team culture, we invest in professional development: training, mentorship and coaching. Depending on your role, you may have the option to work remotely, either part-time or full-time. This flexibility allows you to manage your schedule in a way that suits your lifestyle. Our sales team often benefits from flexible working hours, allowing our sales to start and finish their days at times that work best for them, as long as their goals are met.\n\nThe perks for our sales team go far beyond the typical benefits package. From competitive compensation to professional development, health and wellness support and flexible work arrangements, we strive to create an environment where our salespeople can thrive both professionally and personally. These perks are a reflection of our commitment to valuing and supporting our team members, ensuring that they are motivated, satisfied and equipped to succeed.\n\nSarah Reiff\n\nAccount Executive • Trustpilot\n\nTrustpilot is an independent review platform that helps consumers find businesses they trust.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Trustpilot’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nMy team and colleagues are what make me excited to come to work every day. While we are individual contributors, my team is always collaborating and learning from each other. Together we come up with new outreach strategies, help each other with opportunities and more. Even when we are remote, my team is in constant communication and we’re huge supporters of each other.\n\nAdditionally, working with different businesses every day keeps me engaged and on my toes. I’m able to prospect in various verticals and can focus on multiple industries each day. This is a differentiator from other sales teams I’ve worked for as my focus is broader, and I have more room to reach out to industries that pique my interest.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nThe culture of our sales team is collaborative, fun and welcoming. Everyone is always super friendly and more than happy to help each other out. I’m comfortable reaching out to any of my colleagues for anything because everyone wants to see each other succeed. We are constantly sharing best practices and updating strategies with each other.\n\nMy favorite tradition in the office is the gong and boxing bell that we ring when the deal closes which creates a great energy in the office. The energy is particularly high on closing days when we get to celebrate our wins and head out for team socials to connect and reset before the next month. Aside from closing days, there are various themed events and socials throughout the year such as summer and winter parties, in-office Olympic games, Juneteenth celebrations and more. There’s also a monthly catered community lunch where the whole office comes together, which is a great way to get to know people from other teams.\n\nWhat are your favorite memories from working on this team?\n\nMy favorite memory on the sales team was when I closed my first deal as an account executive. The entire sales floor was so exciting for me, and I received an abundance of support, virtually and in person. This memory really speaks to our culture on the sales floor, as everyone is always happy for each other. Over a year into the role, my colleagues are still extremely supportive and excited for each other. We love to win together.\n\n“We love to win together.”\n\nLiz Clarke\n\nAccount Manager • Altium\n\nAltium offers sophisticated electronics design software with a platform that encompasses the entire electronics journey from design to manufacturing.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Altium’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nI’m passionate about Altium’s suite of products and building relationships with people, both clients and colleagues. I truly care about our clients and their work, making it naturally enjoyable to serve as a trusted advisor every day. The sales team at Altium is very collaborative and reciprocal in terms of challenging and motivating each other to expand our knowledge and methodologies.\n\n“The sales team at Altium is very collaborative and reciprocal in terms of challenging and motivating each other to expand our knowledge and methodologies.”\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nThe culture is welcoming, progressive and rewarding, and everyone — including senior leadership — is very approachable. Altium also makes a point to celebrate work anniversaries and birthdays and host team outings.\n\nWhat are the perks like for sales folks?\n\nThe sales organization hosts individual and team contests with a variety of rewards including spiffs, vouchers, gift cards, work-from-home days, etc.\n\nSteven Kuan\n\nSenior Account Executive • Osano\n\nOsano is a data privacy compliance company that offers an all-in-one platform to help organizations manage their security programs.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Osano’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nOsano was my first major job after college, but even with that limited experience, I still know what makes working at Osano exciting for me. I hear from friends who feel stuck or deal with office drama. Personally, I’ve never encountered either of those feelings in my four years at Osano. I attribute this to Osano’s approach: “Get comfortable with being uncomfortable.” This philosophy — shared by my mentor, Jake Bernstein — resonates deeply with me. It’s important that my daily work is intentional, has a purpose and keeps me growing.\n\nOn Osano’s sales team, I was taught to embrace change and put it into daily practice. Growing in my career and as a person is why I’m consistently excited to come to work every day. The cherry on top is Osano recognizes and rewards this growth and impact. For instance, I started as an entry-level sales development representative, and now I’m a senior account executive. Growth is part of the culture at Osano, so long as you seek it.\n\n“Growth is part of the culture at Osano, so long as you seek it.”\n\nEven though Osano is the only sales team I’ve been part of, I believe what sets us apart is the people, our “Osanians.” We truly value people who share our goals, values and diverse perspectives.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nOur culture at Osano is all about being yourself at work. It’s about embracing who you are and trusting in your ability to do your job in the most authentic way. One of my very first mentors here at Osano — Chief Revenue Officer Dustin Joost — once saved me from a terrible case of imposter syndrome. I was recently promoted from sales development rep to account executive and I had so much to learn. I initially thought I had to be someone else to succeed in sales. Instead, my mentor shared that every salesperson has their own “superpower” which makes them unique in their own way. I took these words to heart and honed my superpower, and now I get to be myself while selling a product I truly believe in and love.\n\nIn the spirit of authenticity, we’ve had a range of special traditions and celebrations at Osano. One of my favorites was when our manager treated us to Taco Bell to celebrate a successful month or quarter. It’s often the little things that help our sales team excel at our work while also enjoying ourselves — almost like we’re living the “live mas” spirit.\n\nWhat are your favorite memories from working on this team?\n\nIn 2022 during our second annual team trip to Austin, we spent a lot of time together attending working sessions as a sales and marketing team and enjoying fun activities like horseback riding, axe throwing, team dinners and more. For me, it’s the in-between conversations where I learn more about my coworkers’ families and their lives outside of work and hobbies, getting to know them on a personal level. Being 100 percent remote, we come together for our annual team trips and pick it right up from where we left off.\n\nOn the final day, we had our company dinner with our first-ever culture awards ceremony. I was nominated and won Osano’s first-ever “2022 Most Revenue Award” on the sales team. It was impactful to win the award and see my mentors, the sales team, and other Osanians who’ve been part of my growth. I have so much pride in being part of Osano and seeing their faces and excitement. Accepting this award has been the highlight of my career so far.\n\nFast forward to today, I’ve continued taking on more responsibilities, becoming a subject matter expert on our data privacy platform, and I feel honored to be able to share my experience and learnings while pushing Osano forward.\n\nDrew LeValley\n\nCommercial AE • Exabeam\n\nExabeam offers AI-driven security operations via its platform, which helps businesses with threat detection, investigation and response processes.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Exabeam’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nI absolutely love coming to work and representing this sales team at Exabeam. In the past, I have worked on teams in person and I actually feel more of a connection working on this team from a remote location, which is pretty fascinating to me. Each person on our team comes from a different career background and experience level. I am definitely still in the earlier stages as far as that goes, but I never feel less than my other teammates. We are all working towards the same goals and have each other’s backs.\n\n“I never feel less than my other teammates. We are all working towards the same goals and have each other’s backs.”\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nThe first word that comes to mind is “family.” Our manager emphasizes this, and I can really feel that day in and day out. My manager and other team members are quick to help me out in any way possible and are kind enough to make themselves available no matter how busy their schedule is. Although we all work from different parts of the country, it doesn’t affect the tight-knit team we have formed. Whenever a deal is closed, no matter how big or small, the entire team is almost immediately sending over praise and celebratory messages.\n\nWhat are your favorite memories of working on this team?\n\nSomething special for me to look back on is that I was included as a part of this team before I was even officially on the team. I had expressed interest in becoming a commercial rep, and my now manager Brian allowed me to join their team calls to get a look at what it’s like and how they operate. The other reps were welcoming and offered to help me out in any way they could. When it came time for the opportunity to join the team, it felt like I had already been accepted as a part of it long before.\n\nGrace Singer\n\nEnterprise Account Executive • FareHarbor\n\nFareHarbor provides an all-in-one booking and business management platform designed for tours, activities, rentals and attractions.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is FareHarbor’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nI’ve worked at FareHarbor for almost eight years, and I’ve never had the “Sunday Scaries” — I genuinely look forward to working. I am motivated by healthy competition amongst my colleagues, and by the uncapped commission. I decide how many calls I make and which companies I reach out to. I love working with our clients, activity businesses, because the owners I speak with are fascinating. I always look forward to conversations with skydivers or scuba divers who are passionate enough about their hobbies to build successful businesses around them.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nMy team name is “Seabeast,” so hopefully that gives you an idea of how fun the environment is here. My coworkers are kind, charismatic and always willing to help each other out. Many sales organizations are all about competition, but with FareHarbor, there are 10 people on my team who are excited to help me strategize. We enjoy dreaming up creative pitches and brainstorming ways to align our software with funky client needs.\n\n“Many sales organizations are all about competition, but with FareHarbor, there are 10 people on my team who are excited to help me strategize.”\n\nDespite being a hybrid company with offices in many cities, I still feel connected to my team members who work farther away. There are always opportunities to join video calls and participate in cold-calling games to get more face time. And when we’re physically in the same place, my teammates are always willing to meet up for ten-too-many dumplings at our favorite local spot.\n\nWhat are the perks like for sales folks?\n\nThere are many perks that are unique to our sales team. Tangible benefits include uncapped commission, sales contests where winners are awarded monetary prizes, seasonal office parties, the option to travel for big client meetings or conferences and more.\n\nThere are also non-tangible perks that add a lot of value from a career perspective. The first is innovation and impact. We are not set in our ways. When I have an idea for a new type of company that we should target or an investment that FareHarbor should make, leadership is all ears. FareHarbor wants to grow and understands the value of fresh perspectives. FareHarbor is not meeting-heavy. Self-sufficient salespeople seeking freedom will excel here. My biggest motivation is seeing my coworkers close gigantic deals and thinking, “Which company in my lead pool will change my life?”\n\nSara Kofman\n\nAccount Executive • Drata\n\nDrata offers automated compliance services from start to audit-ready.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Drata’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nWhat excites me about coming to work each day is the ability to truly help organizations start and scale their compliance programs. This is new for a lot of people I speak with, and it can feel overwhelming for them at first. My job is to help educate them about this process, showcase ways to make this extremely manageable and valuable for their teams and turn what some may consider a daunting or boring project into something exciting.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nI would describe the culture on the Drata sales team as electric. I have never been surrounded by so many skilled, intelligent and genuinely helpful reps in my life. Everyone truly has each other’s backs, is constantly sharing information to help the broader team, is willing to lend a hand to help you win and motivates each other to do better. Sales can and should be a really competitive environment. But at Drata, it doesn’t feel like you’re competing against one another. It feels like you’re competing together — on a team.\n\n“At Drata, it doesn’t feel like you’re competing against one another. It feels like you’re competing together.”\n\nWhat are your favorite memories from working on this team?\n\nMy favorite memories are the in-person quarterly business reviews and annual kickoffs, where we all come together to celebrate a year’s worth of hard work. Seeing my peers in person, learning about their personal lives and accomplishments outside of work and celebrating each other’s performances allow me to feel connected to my peers and less alone in a very challenging role.\n\nNick Zafirson\n\nVP, Sales • Cedar\n\nCedar provides a healthcare services platform that connects providers and payers for an improved healthcare billing experience.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Cedar’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nI’m passionate about solving complex problems that make a tangible difference in people’s lives. Healthcare billing is a notoriously challenging process for millions of Americans, and as someone who has felt the pain and frustration of a poor billing experience firsthand, I feel deeply connected to Cedar’s mission.\n\nI’ve been fortunate to be a part of some amazing teams over my career, but Cedar continues to impress. Everyone on our team is extremely talented, collaborative and committed to the work we do. There are no egos to contend with, and we all recognize that growth is a team sport. With such capable and seasoned experience, I’m confident that this team will produce multiple leaders in our industry.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nCedar’s sales team is as close a group as I have ever been a part of. I consider us a family that actually gets along, and we genuinely can’t wait for opportunities to connect with each other. While I believe every successful sales team should be goal-oriented, I would describe our culture as collaborative and mission-driven. Every new partnership that we solidify gets us one step closer to our mission, and the team member who led the deal has the honor of announcing the news to the entire company. Since complex sales take a village, these announcements are an opportunity for our sales team to thank all teams and individuals who contributed to the company’s success. It’s a great tradition that leads to positive energy across the company.\n\n“I consider us a family that actually gets along, and we genuinely can’t wait for opportunities to connect with each other.”\n\nWhat are your favorite memories from working on this team?\n\nWhile there are many memories to choose from, our team offsites stand out above the rest. Healthcare is a complex industry with long and demanding sales cycles, so it’s critical to balance the hard work with unique opportunities to bond and celebrate our achievements as a team.\n\nA few years ago, we traveled to Park City, UT where we enjoyed a few amazing days of skiing, eating and, to appease those funding the trip, some light strategic planning. On the last night, we made our way to the grand piano in the hotel lobby where a musically talented individual from our team led an impromptu sing-along that lasted well into the night. It wasn’t a planned team-building activity; it was just a group of close friends enjoying each other’s company and having an incredible time. That moment will stay with me forever and is representative of the incredible culture we have built at Cedar.\n\nIf you want to be part of a team where strong bonds and meaningful work come together, consider applying to Cedar.\n\nSean McMaster\n\nStrategic Account Executive • Sendbird\n\nSendbird is a conversation platform that supports chat, voice and video features in other applications.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Sendbird’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nThe part of my job that excites me most about coming to work each day is helping our customers solve their communication challenges. One of Sendbird’s core values is “Endless Tenacity for our Customers,” and it all starts with empowering customers with the right product offerings through strategic consultative selling.\n\nThe sales team at Sendbird is different than other places I have worked for because you get the real sense that leadership cares about your well-being and success. In other places, I have felt more like a number on a large team, but at Sendbird, I feel like I can make a difference that is noticed by the entire company.\n\n“In other places, I have felt more like a number on a large team, but at Sendbird, I feel like I can make a difference that is noticed by the entire company.”\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nThe sales team’s culture at Sendbird demands effort, execution and growth to be successful. The sales team trusts and supports each other, which promotes healthy competition and personal development. The leadership team is quick to mentor and correct any mistakes that may harm the company’s overall success.\n\nThe team also celebrates wins big and small and rallies around those needing help. An example of celebrating wins is with a companywide “#winning” Slack channel solely dedicated to highlighting sales wins and providing positive encouragement and praise to all the team members involved in each deal. This channel helps to build deep relationships across all the teams at Sendbird.\n\nWhat are the perks like for sales folks? What are your favorite memories of working on this team?\n\nThere are many great perks to working at Sendbird in sales, and working remotely is probably at the top of the list for me. This provides a lot of flexibility with the work-life balance that Sendbird promotes. Other perks include an allotted amount of money every year to be your best self, which can only be used to spend on yourself or your family. We also have remote team lunches that are covered by Sendbird on a bi-weekly cadence.\n\nOne of my most incredible memories is our 2022 President’s Club. The top producers among all the teams were invited to stay at the Mayakoba Resort in Playa del Carmen. I have been to many President’s Clubs over the years, and this was by far the most fantastic resort imaginable. There were so many amazing people there from Sendbird, and it truly was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I will never forget sharing with co-workers, whom I view as close friends and family.\n\nEthan Jaffe\n\nAccount Executive, Data Sales • Crexi\n\nCrexi is a commercial real estate technology company that provides transparent information on properties for sale, lease and auction.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Crexi’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nFrom the moment I started, I’ve never had a day I wasn’t excited to go to work. I have the opportunity to talk to diverse personalities, both customers and coworkers. I am surrounded by the most accomplished, smart and driven group of teammates I’ve ever worked with, and it’s not just the sales team — it’s true of the entire company.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nMost sales organizations preach teamwork and collaboration, but Crexi lives and breathes it. Teamwork is our culture. We call clients for each other, close deals for each other and constantly update one another on the most effective strategies. The product is also great. The product team responds to and innovates based on feedback, and it’s great to sell something you believe in. The team’s dynamics and processes are fun, helpful and fair as well. Everyone has the same opportunity to succeed, the same number of leads and the same support system.\n\n“Most sales organizations preach teamwork and collaboration, but Crexi lives and breathes it.”\n\nWhat are the perks like for sales folks?\n\nWe work hard, but we also know how to celebrate our wins. Whether it’s a company-paid trip to Yard House for a birthday lunch or spinning a wheel for bonus money when we hit our numbers, Crexi makes sure our efforts are rewarded with both fun and commission.\n\nAlex Cornman\n\nEnterprise Account Manager • Lansweeper\n\nLansweeper is an IT asset management software provider helping businesses better understand, manage and protect their IT devices and network.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Lansweeper’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nWhat gets me excited to come to work each day is being surrounded by a team that shares similar goals and objectives. We celebrate each other’s wins, big and small. The genuine camaraderie and mutual support make it a rewarding environment. Plus, there’s always someone ready to offer a helping hand when needed, which fosters a strong sense of community and teamwork. It’s this supportive and goal-oriented culture that makes each day here fulfilling and energizing.\n\n“It’s this supportive and goal-oriented culture that makes each day here fulfilling and energizing.”\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nThe culture on our sales team is dynamic and collaborative. We have a supportive environment where everyone is encouraged to share ideas and work together towards common goals. Communication is open and transparent, and there’s a strong emphasis on both individual and team success.\n\nFor traditions, we often celebrate milestones and achievements with team events or social gatherings, which help build camaraderie and boost morale. We also have regular team meetings where we discuss progress, share insights and recognize outstanding contributions.\n\nWhat are your favorite memories of working on this team?\n\nSince Lansweeper is a global company, I particularly look forward to our annual sales kickoff each year. It’s an exciting opportunity for everyone in Austin to connect face-to-face with colleagues who work remotely from different locations. This event allows us to strategize collectively, share insights and align on the initiatives and goals for the year ahead. It’s not just about setting objectives; it’s about coming together as a unified team to build a cohesive strategy and foster relationships that strengthen our collaboration throughout the year. The kickoff energizes us and sets a positive tone for the months to come, making it a highlight of the year.\n\nLaura Fowler\n\nSenior Strategic Account Executive • NextRoll\n\nNextRoll is a marketing technology company that offers multiple software solutions that power B2B marketing and advertising programs.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is NextRoll’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nAt NextRoll, our sales team is very collaborative toward our goal of strategically serving our potential customers. Our collaborative approach is exemplified by the exceptional commitment of our team members.\n\nFor example, a colleague of mine who is a customer success manager took time out of her vacation to provide crucial information to help me with a head-to-head comparison with a competitor. Peers of mine have guided me with tips for using tools within our technology stack. One of our senior product managers here tackles challenging legal and product questions at critical stages, ensuring we’re able to deliver the best solutions. Our onboarding team consistently shares innovative campaign ideas to enhance late-stage opportunities. Additionally, one of our solutions consultants exemplified dedication by inputting a large amount of data into my demo instance for a big presentation I had coming up, even after working a long day.\n\nThese examples highlight how our team unites to either win or go down fighting, always striving to find the best solutions for our customers.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nOur team embodies a healthy, lively spirit, thriving on friendly competition. An example of friendly competition occurred when my teammate and I attended an in-person industry conference and eagerly competed to secure the most scans and booked meetings. While we aimed to win, we also supported each other and ensured that contacts were routed to the appropriate sales segments within our company. Our team is collaborative by sharing creative outreach ideas, calling and meeting success stories and making the process of advancing deals both fun and innovative. Our leadership offers spiffs for self-generated opportunities, fueling our collective success.\n\nOur sales culture is collaborative and supportive, with a strong focus on sharing best practices. We enjoy flexible schedules, essential for managing global accounts effectively. We proudly celebrate and reward the discovery and prospecting of quality opportunities, fostering a motivating and dynamic work environment.\n\n“Our sales culture is collaborative and supportive, with a strong focus on sharing best practices.”\n\nWhat are your favorite memories of working on this team?\n\nOne of my most rewarding experiences was collaborating with our internal teams — solutions consultants, onboarding, customer success, and sales leadership — to secure a deal. Our lead solutions consultant and VP of sales joined me for a virtual demo during a bustling industry convention. Despite the noise and commotion going on around us, we successfully presented to a team of 20 professionals in a late-stage opportunity. Our prior collaboration with their marketing team and the compelling business case we had built were crucial in winning the deal from a well-known competitor. We even overcame that competitor’s discounting efforts to renew with the customer. This experience deepened my connection to our team and heightened my excitement for my role.\n\nCaitlin Lonergan\n\nField Market Manager, New York Metro • Oishii\n\nOishii provides high-quality fruits via its non-GMO, technology-supported indoor, vertical farms.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Oishii’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nThe job is different every day and it keeps me excited. I hate being stuck in a routine, so I love the variety that comes with working in field sales. One day I’m visiting our top-selling stores in New York City, and another day I’m sampling berries at a festival in DC.\n\nI have a nontraditional background for a typical sales job, so Oishii allows me to pull all of my previous experience and skills together into one dynamic and creative role. I have always enjoyed start-up culture and the sense of freedom that comes with trying new things.\n\nWhat I love about our sales team is that we are so much more focused on developing relationships and strategies than just numbers. Yes, numbers are obviously a huge part of sales, but we’re on the ground floor of building the mechanisms to achieve them. Our success is directly reflective of the quality of our work — forming deep connections with customers and store teams and providing valuable feedback about what’s going on in each of our regions to the rest of the sales team at our headquarters and throughout the United States.\n\n“What I love about our sales team is that we are so much more focused on developing relationships and strategies than just numbers.”\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nThe Oishii sales team has a strong sense of camaraderie. It’s essential for us all to feel connected since we are spread across the county, so we chat daily, even if it’s just photos of the latest Oishii berry cocktail we’ve created. Usually, when a problem arises in one region, it’s bound to happen in another, so we are always sharing new insights and strategies with each other.\n\nOne of the philosophies we all believe in is “One Team, One Fight.” We’re a melting pot of individuals and different backgrounds with one common goal: revolutionizing agriculture and fruit. We work collaboratively on cross-regional projects that benefit us all. I personally have worked hard on developing our brand ambassador role, while others have executed some of Oishii’s largest events to date.\n\nA great example of team culture is during large calls, you can often hear a slack “ping” in the background while one of us is presenting their wins for the week — that’s the rest of the sales team chiming in to congratulate them! We also host quarterly dinners for each other in our respective territories. This is a great way to bond and share what makes each region unique.\n\nWhat are the perks like for sales folks?\n\nSales folks at Oishii have lots of perks and opportunities given that we are on the ground floor of a dynamic and ever-growing company. We get the usual benefits of sales positions such as a quarterly bonus and my favorite perk, leftover berries from all of the events we host.\n\nBut really, we have the opportunity to grow in our roles and into other roles. In my own territory, we went from 26 locations to 53 in just a few months. I took this opportunity to grow my team, work on people management and create organizational tools that I’ve been able to share with other rapidly growing regions. We also have the opportunity to move laterally across the company. I’ve seen part-time brand ambassadors turn into full-time managers and others find their passion at Oishii even if it’s not what they initially signed onto.",

      "# [A moment in time: Castaic Middle School unearths time capsule by Katherine Quezada on 2024-05-09](https://signalscv.com/2024/05/a-moment-in-time-castaic-middle-school-unearths-time-capsule/)\nTwenty-five years ago, Castaic Middle School students filled up a box with different timely objects such as a Walkman, a cassette tape, a newspaper with the headline, “Clinton Impeached,” and various other popular objects of the time so people decades later could get a glimpse of what life was like then.\n\nOn Friday, in a special school assembly, current Castaic Middle School students and faculty got to see the many different objects that were placed in the time capsule and buried under a bench on school grounds in 1999.\n\nIt was a trip down memory lane for everyone in attendance and a special experience for eight former teachers who were a part of the school’s faculty dating back to the old school site.\n\nJeanette Edwards, a former teacher from 1996 to 2015, taught English, English as a second language, and foreign languages. She eagerly looked at the table of timely objects such as student I.D cards, a physical education T-shirt and an old textbook that she immediately recognized.\n\n“It’s nostalgic. I started out in the old Castaic Middle School. I came to the new one when it was just ground, I came to the groundbreaking and … to just come here now … it’s still exactly the same,” Edwards said as she also greeted her previous colleagues after not seeing each other for a long time.\n\n“This is a good small-knit community that has so much support,” said Castaic Union School District Superintendent Bob Brauneisen. “We have four of the five principals that have been at Castaic Middle School and rarely are you able to bring back so many people.”\n\nIn attendance was special guest Beverly Silsbee, who was the school’s principal for several decades and one of the few people who witnessed the time capsule being built. She eventually became superintendent for the school district until retiring in 2005.\n\nSilsbee shared the history of Castaic Middle School, and the trailers students took classes in at local park. Silsbee also taught swimming before becoming principal during the 1970s. The trailers used for classes began disintegrating, which pushed the teachers and local community members to advocate for a permanent fully functioning facility, she said.\n\n“Our teachers went out, we passed a bond to fund building a new middle school and eventually it happened,” she said. “Even when we were in trailers, we were a humble campus. We were a distinguished school in those days and a school to watch. It’s not always [about] the way you look.”\n\nCastaic Middle School moved to its current campus and the ASB teacher at the time thought of creating a time capsule. With a lot of hard work, patience, and community involvement, the time capsule was filled and buried.\n\nThe time capsule unearthing was meant to happen sooner, but with the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic “we had to keep putting it off,” said Silsbee. “It should have happened in 2021.”\n\nThe opportunity to reconnect with former colleagues was something Silsbee described as special. “We became a family and I think it’s because we worked so hard together. I think a lot of [the former] staff feels that way.”\n\nDuring the ceremony, the time capsule was updated, and students of the 2024 graduating class filled up a new waterproof tool box with items they believed people in 25 years would enjoy opening.\n\n“It’s exciting. It’s just fun to see them excited about something. I really think it’s an important appreciation of the history of establishing your story,” added Silsbee about the time capsule tradition being kept.",

The hotel was featured in The Brady Bunch season 4 opener in 1972.\n\nOwnership\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1974, Japanese brothers Kenji Osano and Masakuni Osano bought the 3 year-old Sheraton Waikiki Hotel, along with the Sheraton Maui and the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. They already owned the Princess Kaiulani Hotel, the Moana Hotel and the Surfrider Hotel. The Osano brothers formed Kyo-Ya Company Limited, a subsidiary of Kokusai Kogyo Company Limited as the corporate entity charged with overseeing the hotel properties. The purchases put the Osano brothers on the Forbes List of World's Richest People in 1999. After the death of the Osano brothers, Takamasa Osano inherited the billions of dollars owned in properties. The Sheraton Waikiki Hotel is used as the Osano corporate office. In 2004 Takamasa Osano sold 65% of Kokusai Kogyo to Cerberus Partners LP to cover $4 billion in defaulted loans. He still controls 35% of the company.\n\nLabor relations\n\n[edit]\n\nOn November 12, 2024, workers at the Sheraton Waikiki Hotel ratified a new labor contract.[2]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",
