      "# [Cookie Consent For GDPR & CCPA Compliance](https://www.osano.com/cookieconsent)\nSimple Cookie Consent 101\n\nCreating a business and its corresponding online presence is a lot of responsibility. It can take a lot of time, research, management, and monitoring to ensure you’re doing your due diligence to protect your customers and your business from allegations of privacy violations. These days, managing cookie consent is the number one task businesses need to worry about when it comes to protecting their customers, obeying the law, and preserving their reputation.\n\nLet’s quickly walk through four of the most frequently asked questions about cookie consent.\n\nWhat Are Cookies?\n\nCookies are small text files stored on a user’s browser that track and collect data such as their name, geographical location, IP address, and more. They can also track which web pages the user visited and how long they spent on the site.\n\nCookies are often used for marketing purposes and enable businesses to gain data on the sort of people their customers are. They’re a great tool for reaching your target market—but it’s important to use them correctly, or you could find yourself on the wrong side of the law.\n\nWhat Is Cookie Consent?\n\nWhen you visit a new website, you might see a banner pop up at the bottom of your screen with a cookie notice to accept or reject cookies or customize the type of cookies you do accept. The act of accepting cookies is cookie consent.\n\nBut it’s more complicated than just that. For instance, there is opt-in consent and opt-out consent. In the former case, you have to actually click “accept” and opt into the use of cookies before they can load on your browser. In the latter case, the banner might inform you that cookies are active and provide a link to stop them from tracking you—you have to opt out in this case.\n\nDifferent laws require different kinds of cookie consent, which we’ll get into later on in the article.\n\nWhat Laws Require Cookie Consent?\n\nIn the EU, the ePrivacy directive (also called the Cookie Law) protects communications online. However, before the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), there were no cookie consent laws in the United States. There still aren’t any laws at the federal level, though several other states now feature regulations to protect data privacy. Most will be familiar with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. Many other countries and regions are also beginning to pass similar laws.\n\nDo I Need a Cookie Policy on my Website?\n\nIf your website uses cookies, the short answer is yes, you need a cookie policy. Even if your business isn’t physically located in a jurisdiction covered by a cookie consent law, you may still receive web traffic from those regions and process the personal data of people protected by such a law. While you can tailor your cookie notices to only appear to residents within a given location, asking for cookie consent from all of your website visitors is a best practice.\n\nCookie Consent Requirements\n\nOne of the requirements under the GDPR (and most other data privacy laws) is that consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. Specifically, this also means that to be compliant, website visitors must opt in before you can drop cookies onto their browser. That’s in contrast to opt-out laws, where cookies can be loaded until the user says otherwise.\n\nMany businesses use an opt-out model when permitted by their governing law since some visitors default to rejecting or exiting cookie banners without indicating their preference. The CPRA is an example of a law that allows businesses to do this.\n\nThe CPRA’s cookie consent requirements are a little different. While the CPRA does not expressly require that a company use opt-in consent, it does require companies to disclose that cookies are being used and what the information gathered will be used for. Under the CPRA and other data privacy laws, data collected by cookies is considered personal information. The CPRA gives California residents the right to request access or deletion of their personal information, including data collected by cookies.\n\nThe basic requirements across the various laws are to first disclose that your website uses cookies, how you use them, and what rights visitors. This can be done with a pop-up notice or a banner at the bottom of the website.\n\nCookie Consent Popups\n\nA cookie consent manager uses banners or popups to collect consent, provide privacy disclosures, and meet other legal requirements. Some consumers have also started using universal preference signals, like the global privacy control, but most users still expect to indicate their consent on a cookie popup. Many laws require you to accept consent through both avenues to be compliant.\n\nAs described previously, opt-in and opt-out cookie consent popups are the two main approaches to cookie consent. There are also notice-only cookie banners, which inform the visitor that the website uses cookies but doesn’t provide any mechanism for opting into or out of their use. The only choices a user has with a notice-only banner is to disable cookies entirely in their browser or leave the website. These banners, however, are increasingly uncommon and are not compliant with most modern data privacy laws.\n\nCookie Consent Examples\n\nNot every website does cookie consent in the same way. As we mentioned, there are three different kinds of consent (opt-in, opt-out, and notice-only), and not all forms of consent align with data privacy laws.\n\nOther regional requirements may also exist. For example, Brazil, Canada, U.S. states, and other jurisdictions all have privacy laws with different requirements for cookie consent. Some tools make it simple for businesses to properly display the appropriate cookie consent banners based on the user’s location—but what do those banners actually look like?\n\nLet’s look at an example from Osano. We use the Osano Consent Management Platform (CMP) to manage cookies on our website. Osano CMP automatically detects where a visitor is located and delivers the corresponding banner, so if a visitor comes from an opt-out jurisdiction, a banner would appear stating that “This website stores data such as cookies to enable essential site functionality, as well as marketing, personalization, and analytics. By remaining on this website, you indicate your consent.” The banner then links to our cookie policy.\n\nOur policy provides clear instructions on how visitors can turn off or customize their cookies, which is accomplished by clicking the Osano Cookie Consent Tool icon in the lower left-hand of the visitors’ screen (if they’re visiting a website that uses Osano to manage consent).\n\nUsers are then presented with toggles to accept or reject marketing, personalization, analytics cookies, and an option to opt out of the sale or share personal information for targeted advertising (not pictured here).\n\nIf a visitor were to come to osano.com from a jurisdiction that is subject to the GDPR, then the banner might look something like this:\n\nNote that each country subject to this data privacy regulation has its own requirements for cookie banners.\n\nTaking a look at cookie consent examples from other businesses may give you an idea of what sort of banner you need to display on your website.\n\nGDPR Cookie Consent\n\nThe Osano cookie banner shown above serves as a good GDPR cookie consent example, the requirements of which dictate that an organization must:\n\nObtain user consent before deploying any cookies except strictly necessary cookies.\n\nInform users how and why the cookies collect data and what they are being used for.\n\nRecord and store cookie consent from users.\n\nAllow users to access the site or service even if they withdraw consent from certain cookies.\n\nCreate a process for removing consent and cookies that makes it as simple as possible.\n\nCookie consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. That is the direct language from the regulation's Article 4.\n\nIt is also common to include a link to your cookie policy that includes greater detail about the cookies your website uses. This is a great place to provide more information about cookie customization and let your users know what they are giving up when they decline unnecessary cookies such as marketing or analytics cookies.\n\nCookie Consent Managers for Cookie Management\n\nA cookie consent manager is a software tool that helps businesses secure cookie consent from website visitors, manage cookies based on the visitor’s consent preferences, and record that consent. Osano serves as an example of this class of solutions—websites running Osano automatically deploy a cookie consent banner that complies with the visitor’s local data privacy law and language preference.\n\nA management tool for cookie consent can be a major asset to a business seeking to remain compliant with ever-changing data privacy laws. There can be hefty fines for noncompliance. For example, Amazon was issued an $877 million fine in 2021 for GDPR violations. Most organizations won’t accrue violations at the same rate as Amazon, but fines can still be an existential threat to a growing business.\n\nRather than use a consent manager, some businesses opt for GDPR cookie consent plugins for WordPress or similar plugins for web tools. The trouble is that these plugins often offer bare-bones compliance. They often provide a one-size-fits-all cookie consent popup that is either excessively strict (causing you to lose out on value business intelligence) or too permissive (leaving you noncompliant in many jurisdictions).\n\nSuch plugins also lack many ancillary benefits that simplify the process. The Osano cookie consent manager, for instance, also provides cookie policy templates that are easy to tailor to your business—other approaches to cookie law compliance force you to develop those policies from scratch.\n\nRather than rely on plugins or subpar solutions, businesses should keep an eye out for solutions that:\n\nDiscover cookies and other data trackers running on your website.\n\nOffer recommended cookie categories (like marketing, personalization, etc.) that users can individually consent to or reject.\n\nAutomatically display the appropriate banner and language to visitors based on their governing laws and language preferences.\n\nFunction without requiring complicated integrations into your tag manager or manual tweaks to your codebase.\n\nMaintain a history of users’ cookie consent preferences to prove you comply with regulations should the need arise.\n\nWhere to Learn More\n\nCookie consent management is a complicated topic, and we can explore only so much in a blog post. There are other questions to answer, like:\n\nHow do you set up a cookie consent program?\n\nWhat is involved in cookie consent? Is it just putting a banner up on your site\n\nWhen should you ask for tracking consent and show the cookie policy?\n\nHow do you update a cookie list for GDPR cookie consent?\n\nWhat happens if you don't use a cookie consent policy on my website?",
      "# [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.osano.com/faq)\nNo, when you first deploy Osano, it is set automatically to a non-breaking, listener only mode. During that time, it only collects data about the scripts and cookies that load on your website.\n\nRead documentation about Consent Management configuration.\n\nOsano does not collect data about your users other than IP addresses, which are stored for 30 days for fraud and abuse detection and then permanently deleted from our log files. In some jurisdictions, IP addresses are considered PII, so we do recommend adding Osano to your GDPR statement as a sub-processor.\n\nWhen you use the Osano GDPR representative service, if you receive any data subject requests or correspondence from an EU supervisory authority, you will receive an email and upon logging in to Osano, you'll have access to your inbox.\n\nAt that point, you can work with our local EU counsel or your own counsel to decide how you would like to respond.\n\nA key component of responding to data subject requests is that they have to be timely, \"without delay and within one month” -- the efficiency of Osano helps reduce the time crunch for requests.\n\nIt entirely depends on the request. Generally, you will want to verify the identity of the individual to ensure they are authorized to make the request.\n\nIn all cases, you will need to quickly find every single record containing any PII that is associated with that individual. This includes data shared with vendors and data stored in your own databases or files.\n\nIf it is a deletion request you need to respond to the subject confirming the deletion. If it is a simple inquiry you will need to provide the list of fields that you have stored about that individual.\n\nEach vendor is measured on a 163 item ontology. Osano attorneys review the published policies for a vendor and map those practices to the ontology.\n\nIn the application, you can see the summary score, but also the breakdown of how that score was calculated.\n\nYes, when you navigate to a vendor's detail page, you can explore all of the subprocessors for each of those vendors. If you believe a subprocessor may be an important 4th party for your own data, follow that subprocessor as an \"indirect\" vendor to be alerted about score changes, lawsuits, and policy changes.\n\nIf you are a vendor in our system and you are concerned about your score, we recommend that you schedule a time with the Experts. The Experts can help you understand where your practices may be substandard.\n\nThe Experts will not share the ontology with you or provide specifics about your individual score.\n\nIn the application in the \"Policy Changes\" section, you will find an ordered list of the changes for each of your vendors. Viewing the policy allows you to compare versions visually.\n\nThe Osano alerts generally include a summary of who the law applies to, the status of the law (enacted or in consideration), and an explanation of what most Osano customers will want to do in response to the law.\n\nWe encourage you to check with your attorney prior to making any decisions.\n\nIn the Osano application, you will be provided with an option to subscribe to regions that you do business in. Those regions can be states, countries, or broad regions such as the EU. Once Osano knows your preferred regions you will begin receiving updates.\n\nIn order to subscribe to a vendor's lawsuit notifications, you must have added that company as a direct or indirect vendor of yours. The number of vendors you can follow and receive alerts for is based on your tier of service.\n\nIn the application, you can access a case summary. Additional documents related to the case are available. Depending on the case and the court in which it was filed, some documents will be free to access while others require a one time purchase to access the documents.\n\nThe experts can provide you with general guidance on practices that may help improve your score, but the experts can not influence the scores, nor do the experts know how the Osano algorithm weighs the items in the ontology.\n\nNo. Osano does not practice law, does not provide legal advice, and does not provide regulatory guidance. Osano provides information about best practices for privacy programs and implementation. All information provided by Osano is the opinion of the company. You should always consult your own legal counsel for final verification of any decisions.\n\nOpen a ticket with support to enable API access if you are on a tier that includes API access.\n\nOnce API access is enabled for your account you will have access to a screen to generate tokens to submit data.\n\nOsano stores in plain text, the fields that you tell us you store about each individual and a one-way encrypted representation of that information. This makes the information searchable but not reversible. What that means is that you can confirm whether you are storing a person's information based on PII (e.g. email, phone, IP address), but you can not reverse engineer the identity of the person from Osano data nor can any individual piece of information be viewed.\n\nYes, you can search the records of consents and PII storage via API. What you receive back is a yes/no flag on whether that information exists in our ledger for your customer account. You also receive which fields were stored about that individual and which vendors the data has been shared with along with timestamps. You can not retrieve PII in Osano because we do not store the PII, only a hash of the PII.\n\nWe hate to see you go, but you can cancel anytime. In the application, follow the easy instructions. If you are on a trial you will retain access until the trial period is over. If you are on a paid plan you will retain access and be billed through the conclusion of your agreement.\n\nOur commitment to helping organizations improve their privacy practices is part of our charter. If you need Osano services but can not afford them, we're happy to discuss your situation.\n\nOsano also offers discounts to startups who have raised less than $2M in funding, non-profits, and fellow B-corporations.\n\nContact us for a discount code.",

      "# [CCPA Full Text](https://www.osano.com/ccpa)\nCCPA Text\n\nThe section below has the complete, unedited text of the California Consumer Privacy Act. Check out our CCPA Guide if you'd like a description of the law that is easier to read.\n\nAB 375, Title 1.81.5, The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, CCPA\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1.\n\nThis measure shall be known and may be cited as “The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.”\n\nSECTION 2.\n\nThe Legislature finds and declares that:\n\nIn 1972, California voters amended the California Constitution to include the right of privacy among the “inalienable” rights of all people. The amendment established a legal and enforceable right of privacy for every Californian. Fundamental to this right of privacy is the ability of individuals to control the use, including the sale, of their personal information.\n\nSince California voters approved the right of privacy, the California Legislature has adopted specific mechanisms to safeguard Californians’ privacy, including the Online Privacy Protection Act, the Privacy Rights for California Minors in the Digital World Act, and Shine the Light, a California law intended to give Californians the ‘who, what, where, and when’ of how businesses handle consumers’ personal information.\n\nAt the same time, California is one of the world’s leaders in the development of new technologies and related industries. Yet the proliferation of personal information has limited Californians’ ability to properly protect and safeguard their privacy. It is almost impossible to apply for a job, raise a child, drive a car, or make an appointment without sharing personal information.\n\nAs the role of technology and data in the every daily lives of consumers increases, there is an increase in the amount of personal information shared by consumers with businesses. California law has not kept pace with these developments and the personal privacy implications surrounding the collection, use, and protection of personal information.\n\nMany businesses collect personal information from California consumers. They may know where a consumer lives and how many children a consumer has, how fast a consumer drives, a consumer’s personality, sleep habits, biometric and health information, financial information, precise geolocation information, and social networks, to name a few categories.\n\nThe unauthorized disclosure of personal information and the loss of privacy can have devastating effects for individuals, ranging from financial fraud, identity theft, and unnecessary costs to personal time and finances, to destruction of property, harassment, reputational damage, emotional stress, and even potential physical harm.\n\nIn March 2018, it came to light that tens of millions of people had their personal data misused by a data mining firm called Cambridge Analytica. A series of congressional hearings highlighted that our personal information may be vulnerable to misuse when shared on the Internet. As a result, our desire for privacy controls and transparency in data practices is heightened.\n\nPeople desire privacy and more control over their information. California consumers should be able to exercise control over their personal information, and they want to be certain that there are safeguards against misuse of their personal information. It is possible for businesses both to respect consumers’ privacy and provide a high level transparency to their business practices.\n\nTherefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to further Californians’ right to privacy by giving consumers an effective way to control their personal information, by ensuring the following rights\n\n(1) The right of Californians to know what personal information is being collected about them.\n\n(2) The right of Californians to know whether their personal information is sold or disclosed and to whom.\n\n(3) The right of Californians to say no to the sale of personal information.\n\n(4) The right of Californians to access their personal information.\n\n(5) The right of Californians to equal service and price, even if they exercise their privacy rights.\n\nSECTION 3.\n\nTitle 1.81.5 (commencing with Section 1798.100) is added to Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil Code, to read:\n\nTITLE 1.81.5. California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018\n\n1798.100.\n\nA consumer shall have the right to request that a business that collects a consumer’s personal information disclose to that consumer the categories and specific pieces of personal information the business has collected.\n\nA business that collects a consumer’s personal information shall, at or before the point of collection, inform consumers as to the categories of personal information to be collected and the purposes for which the categories of personal information shall be used. A business shall not collect additional categories of personal information or use personal information collected for additional purposes without providing the consumer with notice consistent with this section.\n\nA business shall provide the information specified in subdivision (a) to a consumer only upon receipt of a verifiable consumer request.\n\nA business that receives a verifiable consumer request from a consumer to access personal information shall promptly take steps to disclose and deliver, free of charge to the consumer, the personal information required by this section. The information may be delivered by mail or electronically, and if provided electronically, the information shall be in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, in a readily useable format that allows the consumer to transmit this information to another entity without hindrance.

This subparagraph does not authorize a business to make material, retroactive privacy policy changes or make other changes in their privacy policy in a manner that would violate the Unfair and Deceptive Practices Act (Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 17200) of Part 2 of Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code).\n\n“Service” or “services” means work, labor, and services, including services furnished in connection with the sale or repair of goods.\n\n“Service provider” means a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, association, or other legal entity that is organized or operated for the profit or financial benefit of its shareholders or other owners, that processes information on behalf of a business and to which the business discloses a consumer’s personal information for a business purpose pursuant to a written contract, provided that the contract prohibits the entity receiving the information from retaining, using, or disclosing the personal information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the services specified in the contract for the business, or as otherwise permitted by this title, including retaining, using, or disclosing the personal information for a commercial purpose other than providing the services specified in the contract with the business.\n\n“Third party” means a person who is not any of the following:\n\n(1) The business that collects personal information from consumers under this title.\n\n(2) A person to whom the business discloses a consumer’s personal information for a business purpose pursuant to a written contract, provided that the contract:\n\n(A) Prohibits the person receiving the personal information from:\n\n(i) Selling the personal information.\n\n(ii) Retaining, using, or disclosing the personal information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the services specified in the contract, including retaining, using, or disclosing the personal information for a commercial purpose other than providing the services specified in the contract.\n\n(iii) Retaining, using, or disclosing the information outside of the direct business relationship between the person and the business.\n\n(B) Includes a certification made by the person receiving the personal information that the person understands the restrictions in subparagraph (A) and will comply with them.\n\nA person covered by paragraph (2) that violates any of the restrictions set forth in this title shall be liable for the violations. A business that discloses personal information to a person covered by paragraph (2) in compliance with paragraph (2) shall not be liable under this title if the person receiving the personal information uses it in violation of the restrictions set forth in this title, provided that, at the time of disclosing the personal information, the business does not have actual knowledge, or reason to believe, that the person intends to commit such a violation.\n\n“Unique identifier” or “Unique personal identifier” means a persistent identifier that can be used to recognize a consumer, a family, or a device that is linked to a consumer or family, over time and across different services, including, but not limited to, a device identifier; an Internet Protocol address; cookies, beacons, pixel tags, mobile ad identifiers, or similar technology; customer number, unique pseudonym, or user alias; telephone numbers, or other forms of persistent or probabilistic identifiers that can be used to identify a particular consumer or device. For purposes of this subdivision, “family” means a custodial parent or guardian and any minor children over which the parent or guardian has custody.\n\n“Verifiable consumer request” means a request that is made by a consumer, by a consumer on behalf of the consumer’s minor child, or by a natural person or a person registered with the Secretary of State, authorized by the consumer to act on the consumer’s behalf, and that the business can reasonably verify, pursuant to regulations adopted by the Attorney General pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 1798.185 to be the consumer about whom the business has collected personal information. A business is not obligated to provide information to the consumer pursuant to Sections 1798.110 and 1798.115 if the business cannot verify, pursuant this subdivision and regulations adopted by the Attorney General pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 1798.185, that the consumer making the request is the consumer about whom the business has collected information or is a person authorized by the consumer to act on such consumer’s behalf.\n\n1798.145.\n\nThe obligations imposed on businesses by this title shall not restrict a business’s ability to:\n\n(1) Comply with federal, state, or local laws.\n\n(2) Comply with a civil, criminal, or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena, or summons by federal, state, or local authorities.\n\n(3) Cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the business, service provider, or third party reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state, or local law.\n\n(4) Exercise or defend legal claims.\n\n(5) Collect, use, retain, sell, or disclose consumer information that is deidentified or in the aggregate consumer information.\n\n(6) Collect or sell a consumer’s personal information if every aspect of that commercial conduct takes place wholly outside of California. For purposes of this title, commercial conduct takes place wholly outside of California if the business collected that information while the consumer was outside of California, no part of the sale of the consumer’s personal information occurred in California, and no personal information collected while the consumer was in California is sold. This paragraph shall not permit a business from storing, including on a device, personal information about a consumer when the consumer is in California and then collecting that personal information when the consumer and stored personal information is outside of California.\n\nThe obligations imposed on businesses by Sections 1798.110 to 1798.135, inclusive, shall not apply where compliance by the business with the title would violate an evidentiary privilege under California law and shall not prevent a business from providing the personal information of a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under California law as part of a privileged communication.\n\nThis act shall not apply to protected or health information that is collected by a covered entity governed by the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (Part 2.6 (commencing with Section 56 of Division 1)) or governed by the privacy, security, and breach notification rules issued by the federal Department of Health and Human Services, Parts 160 and 164 of Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations, established pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Availability Act of 1996. For purposes of this subdivision, the definition of “medical information” in Section 56.05 shall apply and the definitions of “protected health information” and “covered entity” from the federal privacy rule shall apply.\n\nThis title shall not apply to the sale of personal information to or from a consumer reporting agency if that information is to be reported in, or used to generate, a consumer report as defined by subdivision (d) of Section 1681a of Title 15 of the United States Code, and use of that information is limited by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681 et seq.).\n\nThis title shall not apply to personal information collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Public Law 106-102), and implementing regulations, if it is in conflict with that law.\n\nThis title shall not apply to personal information collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994 (18 U.S.C. Sec. 2721 et seq.), if it is in conflict with that act.\n\nNotwithstanding a business’ obligations to respond to and honor consumer rights requests pursuant to this title:\n\n(1) A time period for a business to respond to any verified consumer request may be extended by up to 90 additional days where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. The business shall inform the consumer of any such extension within 45 days of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay.\n\n(2) If the business does not take action on the request of the consumer, the business shall inform the consumer, without delay and at the latest within the time period permitted of response by this section, of the reasons for not taking action and any rights the consumer may have to appeal the decision to the business.\n\n(3) If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, a business may either charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested, or refuse to act on the request and notify the consumer of the reason for refusing the request. The business shall bear the burden of demonstrating that any verified consumer request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\n\nA business that discloses personal information to a service provider shall not be liable under this title if the service provider receiving the personal information uses it in violation of the restrictions set forth in the title, provided that, at the time of disclosing the personal information, the business does not have actual knowledge, or reason to believe, that the service provider intends to commit such a violation. A service provider shall likewise not be liable under this title for the obligations of a business for which it provides services as set forth in this title.\n\n(i) This title shall not be construed to require a business to reidentify or otherwise link information that is not maintained in a manner that would be considered personal information.\n\n(j) The rights afforded to consumers and the obligations imposed on the business in this title shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other consumers.\n\n1798.150.\n\n(1) Any consumer whose nonencrypted or nonredacted personal information, as defined in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) of Section 1798.81.5, is subject to an unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft, or disclosure as a result of the business’ violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information to protect the personal information may institute a civil action for any of the following:\n\n(A) To recover damages in an amount not less than one hundred dollars ($100) and not greater than seven hundred and fifty ($750) per consumer per incident or actual damages, whichever is greater.\n\n(B) Injunctive or declaratory relief.\n\n(C) Any other relief the court deems proper.\n\n(2) In assessing the amount of statutory damages, the court shall consider any one or more of the relevant circumstances presented by any of the parties to the case, including, but not limited to, the nature and seriousness of the misconduct, the number of violations, the persistence of the misconduct, the length of time over which the misconduct occurred, the willfulness of the defendant’s misconduct, and the defendant’s assets, liabilities, and net worth.\n\nActions pursuant to this section may be brought by a consumer if all of the following requirements are met:\n\n(1) Prior to initiating any action against a business for statutory damages on an individual or class-wide basis, a consumer shall provide a business 30 days’ written notice identifying the specific provisions of this title the consumer alleges have been or are being violated. In the event a cure is possible, if within the 30 days the business actually cures the noticed violation and provides the consumer an express written statement that the violations have been cured and that no further violations shall occur, no action for individual statutory damages or class-wide statutory damages may be initiated against the business. No notice shall be required prior to an individual consumer initiating an action solely for actual pecuniary damages suffered as a result of the alleged violations of this title. If a business continues to violate this title in breach of the express written statement provided to the consumer under this section, the consumer may initiate an action against the business to enforce the written statement and may pursue statutory damages for each breach of the express written statement, as well as any other violation of the title that postdates the written statement.\n\n(2) A consumer bringing an action as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) shall notify the Attorney General within 30 days that the action has been filed.\n\n(3) The Attorney General, upon receiving such notice shall, within 30 days, do one of the following:\n\n(A) Notify the consumer bringing the action of the Attorney General’s intent to prosecute an action against the violation. If the Attorney General does not prosecute within six months, the consumer may proceed with the action.\n\n(B) Refrain from acting within the 30 days, allowing the consumer bringing the action to proceed.\n\n(C) Notify the consumer bringing the action that the consumer shall not proceed with the action.\n\nNothing in this act shall be interpreted to serve as the basis for a private right of action under any other law. This shall not be construed to relieve any party from any duties or obligations imposed under other law or the United States or California Constitution.\n\n1798.155.\n\nAny business or third party may seek the opinion of the Attorney General for guidance on how to comply with the provisions of this title.\n\nA business shall be in violation of this title if it fails to cure any alleged violation within 30 days after being notified of alleged noncompliance. Any business, service provider, or other person that violates this title shall be liable for a civil penalty as provided in Section 17206 of the Business and Professions Code in a civil action brought in the name of the people of the State of California by the Attorney General. The civil penalties provided for in this section shall be exclusively assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the people of the State of California by the Attorney General.\n\nNotwithstanding Section 17206 of the Business and Professions Code, any person, business, or service provider that intentionally violates this title may be liable for a civil penalty of up to seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) for each violation.\n\nNotwithstanding Section 17206 of the Business and Professions Code, any civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 17206 for a violation of this title, and the proceeds of any settlement of an action brought pursuant to subdivision (a), shall be allocated as follows:\n\n(1) Twenty percent to the Consumer Privacy Fund, created within the General Fund pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1798.109, with the intent to fully offset any costs incurred by the state courts and the Attorney General in connection with this title.\n\n(2) Eighty percent to the jurisdiction on whose behalf the action leading to the civil penalty was brought.\n\nIt is the intent of the Legislature that the percentages specified in subdivision (c) be adjusted as necessary to ensure that any civil penalties assessed for a violation of this title fully offset any costs incurred by the state courts and the Attorney General in connection with this title, including a sufficient amount to cover any deficit from a prior fiscal year.\n\n1798.160.\n\nA special fund to be known as the “Consumer Privacy Fund” is hereby created within the General Fund in the State Treasury, and is available upon appropriation by the Legislature to offset any costs incurred by the state courts in connection with actions brought to enforce this title and any costs incurred by the Attorney General in carrying out the Attorney General’s duties under this title.\n\nFunds transferred to the Consumer Privacy Fund shall be used exclusively to offset any costs incurred by the state courts and the Attorney General in connection with this title. These funds shall not be subject to appropriation or transfer by the Legislature for any other purpose, unless the Director of Finance determines that the funds are in excess of the funding needed to fully offset the costs incurred by the state courts and the Attorney General in connection with this title, in which case the Legislature may appropriate excess funds for other purposes.\n\n1798.175.\n\nThis title is intended to further the constitutional right of privacy and to supplement existing laws relating to consumers’ personal information, including, but not limited to, Chapter 22 (commencing with Section 22575) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code and Title 1.81 (commencing with Section 1798.80). The provisions of this title are not limited to information collected electronically or over the Internet, but apply to the collection and sale of all personal information collected by a business from consumers. Wherever possible, law relating to consumers’ personal information should be construed to harmonize with the provisions of this title, but in the event of a conflict between other laws and the provisions of this title, the provisions of the law that afford the greatest protection for the right of privacy for consumers shall control.\n\n1798.180.\n\nThis title is a matter of statewide concern and supersedes and preempts all rules, regulations, codes, ordinances, and other laws adopted by a city, county, city and county, municipality, or local agency regarding the collection and sale of consumers’ personal information by a business.\n\n1798.185.\n\nOn or before January 1, 2020, the Attorney General shall solicit broad public participation to adopt regulations to further the purposes of this title, including, but not limited to, the following areas:\n\n(1) Updating as needed additional categories of personal information to those enumerated in subdivision (c) of Section 1798.130 and subdivision (o) of Section 1798.140 in order to address changes in technology, data collection practices, obstacles to implementation, and privacy concerns.\n\n(2) Updating as needed the definition of unique identifiers to address changes in technology, data collection, obstacles to implementation, and privacy concerns, and additional categories to the definition of designated methods for submitting requests to facilitate a consumer’s ability to obtain information from a business pursuant to Section 1798.130.\n\n(3) Establishing any exceptions necessary to comply with state or federal law, including, but not limited to, those relating to trade secrets and intellectual property rights, within one year of passage of this title and as needed thereafter.\n\n(4) Establishing rules and procedures for the following, within one year of passage of this title and as needed thereafter:\n\n(A) To facilitate and govern the submission of a request by a consumer to opt out of the sale of personal information pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 1798.145.\n\n(B) To govern business compliance with a consumer’s opt-out request.\n\n(C) The development and use of a recognizable and uniform opt-out logo or button by all businesses to promote consumer awareness of the opportunity to opt out of the sale of personal information.\n\n(5) Adjusting the monetary threshold in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of Section 1798.106 in January of every odd-numbered year to reflect any increase in the Consumer Price Index.\n\n(6) Establishing rules, procedures, and any exceptions necessary to ensure that the notices and information that businesses are required to provide pursuant to this title are provided in a manner that may be easily understood by the average consumer, are accessible to consumers with disabilities, and are available in the language primarily used to interact with the consumer, including establishing rules and guidelines regarding financial incentive offerings, within one year of passage of this title and as needed thereafter.\n\n(7) Establishing rules and procedures to further the purposes of Sections 1798.110 and 1798.115 and to facilitate a consumer’s or the consumer’s authorized agent’s ability to obtain information pursuant to Section 1798.130, with the goal of minimizing the administrative burden on consumers, taking into account available technology, security concerns, and the burden on the business, to govern a business’ determination that a request for information received by a consumer is a verifiable request, including treating a request submitted through a password-protected account maintained by the consumer with the business while the consumer is logged into the account as a verifiable request and providing a mechanism for a consumer who does not maintain an account with the business to request information through the business’ authentication of the consumer’s identity, within one year of passage of this title and as needed thereafter.\n\nThe Attorney General may adopt additional regulations as necessary to further the purposes of this title.\n\n1798.190.\n\nIf a series of steps or transactions were component parts of a single transaction intended from the beginning to be taken with the intention of avoiding the reach of this title, including the disclosure of information by a business to a third party in order to avoid the definition of sell, a court shall disregard the intermediate steps or transactions for purposes of effectuating the purposes of this title.\n\n1798.192.\n\nAny provision of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive or limit in any way a consumer’s rights under this title, including, but not limited to, any right to a remedy or means of enforcement, shall be deemed contrary to public policy and shall be void and unenforceable. This section shall not prevent a consumer from declining to request information from a business, declining to opt out of a business’ sale of the consumer’s personal information, or authorizing a business to sell the consumer’s personal information after previously opting out.\n\n1798.194.\n\nThis title shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.\n\n1798.196.\n\nThis title is intended to supplement federal and state law, if permissible, but shall not apply if such application is preempted by, or in conflict with, federal law or the California Constitution.\n\n1798.198.\n\nSubject to limitation provided in subdivision (b), this title shall be operative January 1, 2020.\n\n(b) This act shall become operative only if initiative measure No. 17-0039, The Consumer Right to Privacy Act of 2018, is withdrawn from the ballot pursuant to Section 9604 of the Elections Code.\n\nSECTION 4.",

      "# [The Ultimate Guide to the GDPR](https://www.osano.com/gdpr)\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is the GDPR?\n\nWhen did the GDPR go into effect?\n\nGDPR requirements, scope, and definitions\n\nGDPR terms and concepts you must understand\n\nWhat are data subject rights under the GDPR?\n\nWhat is the consideration for data deletion under the GDPR?\n\nHow do I comply with the seven principles of the GDPR?\n\nWhat are the requirements for processing personal data under the GDPR?\n\nWhat is the definition of \"consent\" under the GDPR?\n\nWhat are the rules on children's data under the GDPR?\n\nHow does the GDPR affect marketing?\n\nWhat are cookies under the GDPR?\n\nWho enforces the GDPR?\n\nWhat are the punishments for violating the GDPR?\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWhat is the GDPR?\n\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation changed the world of privacy law. It obligated companies to make sweeping changes to their data protection and privacy practices to comply or face potentially massive fines.\n\nIt was technically \"adopted\" in 2016, but lawmakers gave organizations a two-year grace period to revamp whatever policies necessary to come into compliance. It finally went into effect in May 2018.\n\nEurope has always been ahead of the game on data protection. Its laws date back 70 years. Before the GDPR, the European Convention on Human Rights of 1950 granted European's a right to privacy. The Convention served as the impetus for codifying the right to privacy into law.\n\nBefore the GDPR, the EU Data Protection Directive regulated data privacy. But it became effective in 1995, long before companies were collecting data at the scale they are now, and long before digital commerce created end-user data trails that advertisers could track across the web.\n\nBut by 2012, the European Parliament realized that the Directive wasn't enough. Websites were vacuuming up user data at an unprecedented rate, and the existing hodgepodge of privacy laws across the (then-28) member states was confusing and insufficient. They decided to draft a regulation, the strongest form of legal enforcement in the EU.\n\nIt comes down to this: If your organization collects, uses, or stores EU citizens' personal data, regardless of where it's processed, you're covered by this law.\n\nWhen did the GDPR go into effect?\n\nThe GDPR went into effect on May 25, 2018. Regulators gave organizations a two-year grace period before enforcement began.\n\nGDPR requirements, scope, and definitions\n\nThough the GDPR is an EU-based law, it doesn't apply to only EU companies. It has what's called extraterritorial reach. That means that even if a company doesn't operate within the EU -- say it's U.S.-based -- but has customers in the EU, it must comply with the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR required EU member states to pass national laws that closely mapped to the GDPR's provisions.\n\nThe GDPR aims to give individuals — which the legislation calls \"data subjects\" — privacy protections but also allow businesses relying on data to survive or thrive. To strike this balance, the GDPR introduced new concepts for protecting data. Those include:\n\nExpanded definitions for \"personal data\" and \"sensitive data.\"\n\nData protection by design principles for technology and operations.\n\nAccountability measures.\n\nExpanded data subject rights, including the right to be forgotten and to object to automated data processing.\n\nProvisions on data breach notification.\n\nIn addition, companies' partners are on the hook. If you process data on behalf of a company with EU citizens, you must comply with the GDPR.\n\nGDPR terms and concepts you must understand\n\nUnderstanding the GDPR requires working definitions of the vocabulary it uses. Here is a list of some of the most important terms.\n\nPersonal Data: Any information that can directly or indirectly identify an individual. This includes names, email addresses, ethnicity, zip code or other location information, gender, banking details, IP addresses, biometric data, religious and political beliefs, web cookies and even social media posts.\n\nData Processing: Any action performed on data, including manual and automatic methods.\n\nData Controllers: The person who decides why, when and how personal data is processed.\n\nData Subject: A person whose data is processed. Think customers, subscribers.\n\nData Processor: Any third-party organization that engages in processing personal data, including email marketing tools, analytics tools, and cloud vendors.\n\nAccountability: Organizations must put technical and organizational measures in place to demonstrate what they did with data and why it was necessary.\n\nTransparency: Organizations must communicate to data subjects about data processing in a way that's \"easily accessible and easy to understand\" and uses \"clear and plain language.\"\n\nPrivacy by Design: Data protection through technology design.\n\nWhat are data subject rights under the GDPR?\n\nThe GDPR grants specific rights to data subjects to increase transparency and give them control over their data and how it's used. It's essential to know these data rights so you can responsibly comply when they want to exercise their privacy rights.\n\nThey are:\n\nThe right to be informed that you've collected and used personal data. If you collected it from the subject yourself, you have to notify the data subject at the time of collection. Suppose you're a third-party vendor, for example, and obtained the data secondarily. In that case, the data subject must be informed within a \"reasonable period of time,\" no later than 30 days, and in an easily accessible form.\n\nThe right to access personal data and how it's processed. A data subject can ask for a copy of all the data being processed about them. It's called a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR). It's essential to have a mechanism to intake DSARs because a data subject can request a copy of the data, an overview of the categories of data you're processing, why you're doing so, and any parties with whom you're sharing the data.\n\nThe right to rectify inaccurate or incomplete personal data. If an individual requests rectification (verbally or in writing), you have one month to comply. If the request is \"excessive or \"manifestly unfounded,\" you can refuse.\n\nThe right to erase data. Under this rule, a data subject has the right to request that you erase their personal data within 30 days. Certain conditions must exist for the request to be legitimate, of course. These include: if the data is no longer relevant, the original purpose for collection has been satisfied, or if a data subject withdraws consent. If any of those apply, you have to stop processing their data and further disseminating that data.\n\nThe right to restrict the processing of personal data. If a data subject requests this, you have to stop processing their data, but you can still store it. Requests can be made verbally or in writing, and you have 30 days to respond.\n\nThe right to data portability. Data subjects must be allowed to take their data from one platform to another and do so easily, safely, and securely. Data controllers must allow it without disrupting its useability. You must provide data subjects with the entirety of their data in a standard, machine-readable format.\n\nThe right to object. Data subjects can object to how their information is used for marketing, sales or non-service-related purposes. An organization must inform individuals of their right to object within the first communication. Organizations must examine each objection, but it can refuse to validate the objection if one of the following is true:\n\nLegal or official authority is being carried out.\n\nThe organization has a \"legitimate interest\" to process data to provide a data subject with a service they signed up for.\n\nA task is being carried out for public benefit.\n\nAn organization can also refuse a request if the objection request is \"excessive\" or \"manifestly unfounded.\"\n\nAutomated decision-making and profiling. Data subjects have the right to say no to solely automated decisions — including profiling — being made about their data that could have a legal or similarly significant effect on them. For instance, a website that automatically approves or denies people loans or makes hiring decisions would have a \"significant effect\" on their lives. Data subjects can opt-out of these practices.\n\nWhat is the consideration for data deletion under the GDPR?\n\nAs mentioned in the above section, data subjects have the right to request that organizations delete personal data about them \"without undue delay.\" The requirements that must apply for a deletion request to be valid are:\n\nThe data isn't needed anymore for the purpose it was collected or processed.\n\nThe data subject is withdrawing consent for the processing, and there is no other legal ground for the processing.\n\nThe data subject objects to the processing, and there are no other legitimate grounds for the processing\n\nThe personal data was unlawfully processed in the first place.\n\nThe personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation.\n\nData subjects can't request deletion if the data is a matter of freedom of expression or information, if the processing is a matter of public health, or if the data is archived for scientific or historical research purposes.\n\nHow do I comply with the seven principles of the GDPR?\n\nThe GDPR comprises seven principles with which organizations must comply. They are as follows:\n\nLawfulness, fairness, and transparency: Processing data should abide by the law, treat data subjects fairly and be transparent.\n\nPurpose limitation: Companies should only process data for legitimate purposes that you specify for each data subject before you collect it.\n\nData minimization: Data processors must collect and use only the data absolutely necessary to complete their business and limit access to personal data to only those employees needing the information to complete the process consented to by the data subject.\n\nAccuracy: Organizations should keep their data accurate at all times.\n\nStorage limitation: Organizations should only store personal data as long as necessary for the intended purpose. Organizations should delete the data when they're done with it.\n\nIntegrity and confidentiality: Organizations should process data to protect its security, integrity, and privacy. (For instance, transferring data with encryption).\n\nAccountability: Organizations are responsible for demonstrating GDPR compliance. Regulators expect detailed documentation about the data collected, how it's used, and where it's stored. Organizations must train staff well to implement organizational security measures. And organizations must have data processing agreements in place with all third-party vendors who process data on their behalf.\n\nWhat are the requirements for processing personal data under the GDPR?\n\nThe GDPR mandates that organizations only collect, store, process or sell data under one of the following lawful bases apply:\n\nThe data subject gave specific consent to process the data.\n\nThe processing is necessary to enter into a contract with the data subject.\n\nYou need to comply with a legal obligation, like a court order.\n\nThe processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or someone else. Meaning, processing the data could save a life.\n\nThe processing is necessary to carry out a task of public interest.\n\nLegitimate interest: You're using the data in a way the data subject would expect given the service or product you're offering.\n\nWhat is the definition of \"consent\" under the GDPR?\n\nTo legally process data, the reason for doing so must fall under one of the GDPR's six legal bases, as listed above. Consent is one of them, and it's one of the most significant changes the GDPR ushered in, requiring organizations to acquire permission, explicitly, from any data subject before collecting their data. Not only must organizations gain consent, but they must use language that's easy to understand when asking the data subject for it.\n\nThe GDPR says a data subject consent means: \"any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by [them], by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.\"\n\nSo, if you're processing based on consent, you must:\n\nDemonstrate the data subject granted consent to processing their data.\n\nEnsure the request for consent was in clear and plain language and in an easily accessible form.\n\nEnsure the data subject has the right to revoke consent at any time\n\nIf the data subject doesn't grant consent, you must still allow them the same experience and access to your site as the data subjects who consented.\n\nWhat are the rules on children's data under the GDPR?\n\nIf you seek to process children's data, you may never ask a person age 13 or under to give you consent. If you're asking for consent for children ages 13-15, you must also ask their parent or guardian. Children age 16 and up may give consent for themselves.\n\nHow does the GDPR affect marketing?\n\nThe GDPR grants specific rights to data subjects to increase transparency and give them control over their data and how it's used. In marketing, of course, the more you know about a customer, the better the sales. Determining insights about consumer interests and preferences is key to delivering relevant ads and offers. That can put the marketing tactics of younger days in conflict with the GDPR's rules. It's essential to check your practices against some of the data rights mentioned in our earlier section so you can be sure you're collecting data legally and to enable you to comply if a data subject wants to exercise their privacy rights.\n\nThe most important aspect of the GDPR to marketers are its data collection provisions, profiling data subjects, and targeted ads. The GDPR requires organizations to be transparent with data subjects about how their data will be used.\n\nYou must notify customers at your first interaction that you're collecting their data. And remember, if you're a third-party vendor, you must inform the data subject within 30 days in an easy-to-read format.\n\nData discovery\n\nIt's essential to determine where your data lives in order to comply with data subject's rights under the GDPR. This is called data discovery or data mapping. That will allow you to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal data if a data subject requests you do so, and you will be able to respond to data subject access requests (DSARs) promptly. DSARs, as mentioned above, allow the data subject to request a copy of all the data you've collected on them. It can be complicated to find, categorize, and report back if you don't know where the information lives across the organization.\n\nIt's also essential to check your records to ensure you've asked the data subjects for explicit opt-in consent to process their data (no pre-ticked checkboxes!), and you've only used the data for the purpose it was collected.\n\nIf the data subject said you could collect their data to process a bill, it's not appropriate to automatically add that information onto a mailing list.\n\nIn addition, you must ensure you've given data subjects the ability to opt out of targeted advertising. And that brings us to the conversation about cookies.\n\nWhat are cookies under the GDPR?\n\nMarketers depend on cookies — small text files that store data— to follow users around the web to glean insights on users' preferences and locations, among other details. Under the GDPR, cookies can be considered personal data. If a cookie can identify a person based on their device, that's deemed personal data. Cookies considered personal data under the GDPR can include \"a name, an identification number, location data or an online identifier.\" A special mention should be made for biometric data, such as fingerprints, which can also work as identifiers. These get a bit tricky. For help on this, the GDPR provides several examples of online identifiers in Recital 30. They include:\n\nInternet protocol (IP) addresses.\n\nRadio frequency identification (RFID) tags.\n\nIt's essential to look at the types of cookies your organization is deploying. If they're \"strictly necessary\" cookies, meaning they're required for the site to function, consent is not required. Otherwise, it is. Be sure to collect consent for marketing cookies, record that consent and allow it easy for data subjects to revoke consent as it was for them to say yes.\n\nWho enforces the GDPR?\n\nIndividual data protection authorities (DPAs) from the 27 EU member states enforce the GDPR. DPAs are independent of the government. They investigate complaints, provide advice on data protection issues and determine when the GDPR has been breached. They also have fining powers.\n\nDPAs are independent public authorities that supervise the application of the data protection law through investigative and corrective powers. They provide expert advice on data protection issues and handle complaints lodged against the General Data Protection Regulation violations and the relevant national laws.\n\nAll DPAs work together as a group on the European Data Protection Board. The European Data Protection Supervisor leads the board. The EDPB aims to harmonize GDPR enforcement across the EU. The board is responsible for guiding member states on complicated topics or the application of the law. It also issues opinions to the European Commission when it considers data protection and privacy legislation or issues.\n\nThe EDPB does not, however, enforce data protection law.\n\nWhat are the punishments for violating the GDPR?\n\nThe cost of noncompliance with the GDPR can be high. Organizations that violate the law can be fined up to 4% of annual global revenue or 20 million euros, whichever is greater.\n\nYou've probably seen some of the media headlines reporting on DPAs taking action against various companies for GDPR violations. Some of the more hefty fines include:\n\nThe Irish DPA's $267 million fine against WhatsApp in September 2021.\n\nThe Luxembourg DPA's $887 fine against Amazon in July 2021.\n\nThe French DPA's $593 million fine against Google in July 2021.\n\nWhile it's often the big technology firms that have faced the most significant fines thus far, reading the enforcement actions will give you an indication of how the DPAs are thinking and in which areas they're most strict on enforcing.\n\nWhile the GDPR is a massive piece of legislation and can be challenging to interpret, it serves as the basis for many international laws that have passed since its inception, so it's a vital regulation to understand. For example, the terms may change from the GDPR to Brazil's privacy law, but the concepts are the same. The trend is toward increased data subject rights, transparency, and accountability.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWhere can I find the full GDPR text?\n\nYou can find the full text on our site here.\n\nHow many different articles are there in the GDPR? Where can I find them?\n\nAs of this writing, there are 99 articles in the GDPR, separated into 11 separate chapters (even subsections). You can find their full text here.\n\nWhat do I need to do to comply with the GDPR?\n\nTo start, as mentioned above, there are 7 different principles that guide the GDPR. Following these principles are a start to help you stay compliant with the law, but it's a little more complicated than simply \"minimizing data.\" You'll also need to bring on a Data Protection Officer, limit access to personal data to only the employees who need it, and implement Privacy by Design into your organization's processes. Learn more here.\n\nWhat are the most important components of the GDPR that I should know?\n\nThere's a lot to unpack in any data privacy law, but we highly recommend you understand the 8 rights data subjects are afforded by the GDPR, how the GDPR applies to you (even if you're not in the EU), whether you need a GDPR representative, the penalties associated with GDPR violations, the importance of opting in, and more. Learn about them here.\n\nWhat is a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR)?\n\nA data subject access request (DSAR) is a type of request made by a consumer or customer (or employee, depending on the law) to an organization, exercising their rights over the personal information the organization has collected on them. The request could be to see the data the organization has, that the data is deleted, changed, made anonymous, and more. Learn about DSARs in our article here.\n\nWhat does data minimization even mean?\n\nAccording to our article on the data minimization principle, \"Article 5(1)(c) of the GDPR defines data minimization by saying that personal data should be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.” In other words, businesses should only collect essential information and only keep it as long as it’s actually needed.\"\n\nWhat are data protection impact assessments (DPIAs)?\n\nData protection impact assessments, or DPIAs, are audits meant to assess risk when it comes to data processing. They're a key component to the data minimization principle, though who must perform one and when can be a little confusing. Learn more about whether you need to perform one here.\n\nWhat is a record of processing activities (RoPA)?\n\nArticle 30 of the GDPR requires organizations to keep a record of how they process data, referred to commonly as a RoPA. That's great, but you might have even more questions now, such as \"Who has to keep track of it?\" \"What information needs to be in the RoPA?\" \"Who needs to see the record?\" Find answers to the rest of these questions in our blog detailing out records of processing activities here.",

      "# [What Is the ADPPA (American Data Privacy and Protection Act)? by Matt Davis, CIPM (IAPP) on 2022-08-05](https://www.osano.com/articles/adppa)\nLooking for information on the more recent American Privacy Rights Act? You can find a summary here.\n\nWill the US soon see a federal data privacy bill? Something that equals or surpasses the GDPR?\n\nWhat Is the American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA)?\n\nWhen it was introduced in 2022, the American Data Privacy Protection Act (ADPPA) made it further along the federal legislative process than any other data privacy regulation in the US. Although the ADPPA passed out of committee with a bipartisan 53-2 vote, it failed to advance to the House or Senate floors in the last Congress—but that doesn't mean businesses and privacy professionals should write the ADPPA off.\n\nOn March 1st, 2023, the Innovation, Data, and Commerce Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing primarily focused on the ADPPA. The bill has yet to be reintroduced in Congress, but the hearing signaled that the ADPPA still enjoys significant support. If there is to be a federal data privacy bill in the U.S., it seems like it'll either come in the form of the ADPPA or in a bill that closely resembles it.\n\nTo get prepared for the possibility that it becomes law, we’ll dive into the ADPPA’s notable features, current amendments, criticisms, next steps, and overall chances in the House and Senate.\n\nWhat’s in the ADPPA Bill Currently?\n\nThe ADPPA features many of the same components as other modern data privacy laws, like the CPRA. (For an overview of the fundamental components of a modern data privacy law, see our blog, \"The anatomy of a data privacy law\"). Naturally, the bill varies in some of its details, and some of those variations could have a big impact on businesses should the ADPPA be enacted into law. Let’s take a look at some of the bill’s notable features and the amendments that have been made to date.\n\nNotable Features of the ADPPA\n\nVariations in Definitions\n\nThe ADPPA refers to businesses and data in different terms and with a different scope than other data privacy laws. The major differences include:\n\n“Covered entities,” which are defined as any entity or person that collects, processes, or transfers data and is subject to the Federal Trade Commission Act, is a common carrier under the Communications Act, or is a non-profit. This definition covers the vast majority of businesses.\n\n“Covered data,” which includes any information that identifies, is linked, or is reasonably linkable to an individual or a device. It also includes any data or unique identifiers derived from such information, like IP addresses, targeted advertising identifiers, and the like.\n\n“Children,” which are defined as any person under the age of 17. This is significant as data privacy laws often require businesses to treat children’s data in certain ways. Most other data privacy laws define children as people under the age of 13 or 16.\n\n“Sensitive data,” which includes categories of data beyond what other state privacy laws consider sensitive. Most laws consider info like race, ethnicity, genetic data, children’s data, and the like to be sensitive; California also includes union membership and identifiers like social security numbers; the ADPPA includes all of that as well as login credentials for any device. There are other minor deviations as well, but it is beyond the scope of this article to list each.\n\nPreemption\n\nIf the ADPPA is signed into law, it will preempt all other state data privacy laws. So, a business that is currently subject to Connecticut’s CTDPA, for instance, would instead need to be in compliance with the ADPPA.\n\nPreemption is a big sticking point in the bill. Many states — especially California — don’t want their own laws to be superseded by the ADPPA.\n\nThe ADPPA does make several exceptions to its preemption, however. More specific laws governing data privacy, like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) would still apply, as well as certain elements of California’s CPRA (more on that later.)\n\nPrivate Right of Action\n\nA private right of action refers to the ability of individuals to sue businesses for noncompliance. Most US data privacy laws do not feature a private right of action, but the ADPPA does.\n\nPrior to suing, however, an individual would need to inform the FTC or their state attorney general. Then, the FTC and/or state attorney general have 60 days to decide whether to intervene in the lawsuit. Additionally, the individual has to let the business know they intend to sue, and they have to give the business 45 days to correct the violation prior to contacting the FTC/attorney general.\n\nSpecial Category for Large Data Holders\n\nThe ADPPA treats businesses that handle significant amounts of data differently than others. To qualify as a large data holder, a business must:\n\nMake more than $250 million in gross annual revenue and\n\nProcess the data of more than 5 million individuals or\n\nProcess the sensitive data of 200,000 individuals annually.\n\nThese are your Facebooks and Googles of the world. Under the ADPPA, they would have all sorts of additional disclosure, certification, and audit requirements.\n\nSpecial Category for Small Businesses\n\nThe ADPPA defines small businesses as those that:\n\nAre not data brokers,\n\nHave less than $41 million in gross annual revenue, and\n\nProcess the data of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually.\n\nMost notably, it has no lower threshold — other state privacy laws generally don’t restrict businesses that process fewer than 100,000 individuals’ data. Thus, nearly every kind of business is subject to the ADPPA in one way or another. And while there are some exceptions as to what applies to small businesses under the ADPPA, most of its requirements still hold.\n\nRight to Opt-out of Data Transfer\n\nLike other state data privacy laws, the ADPPA gives consumers a variety of rights. An additional right that only it and the CPRA provide is the right for consumers to opt out of having their data transferred to third parties. Other state laws allow individuals to opt out of the sale of their data, but only the CPRA and ADPPA allow individuals to opt out of transfers regardless of whether money changes hands.\n\nAmendments to the ADPPA\n\nFor the most part, the features we described above have been with the bill since its beginning. As of this writing, the ADPPA has just emerged from the House committee, where it was amended in certain ways to improve its odds in a House floor vote and in the Senate. Here’s what the committee changed.\n\nThe CPPA Gets to Enforce the ADPPA in California\n\nEnforcement has been a major criticism of this bill. California’s representatives are unhappy that the ADPPA might preempt their CPRA, which is generally stronger and has more teeth. Since California has a lot of sway in the US legislature, an amendment was made to make California’s CPRA enforcement agency — the California Privacy Protection Authority (CPPA) — responsible for enforcing the ADPPA in California. For other states, the FTC and/or attorney general would enforce the ADPPA.\n\nPrivate Right of Action Becomes Possible in Two Years\n\nThe original bill would have allowed for a private right of action to be permissible four years after enactment; this amendment makes it permissible in two.\n\nSmall Businesses Are Exempt From Private Action\n\nThis amendment excludes small businesses from private lawsuits if they make less than $25 million revenue annually, have fewer than 50,000 individuals’ covered data, and earn less than half their revenue from transferring covered data.\n\nGreater Exclusions for Employee Data\n\nLike other privacy laws, the ADPPA treats employee data differently from consumer data. This amendment expanded the carveout for employee data by including additional data categories.\n\nTiered Approach for What Constitutes “Knowledge” That a Consumer Is Under 17\n\nChildren’s data is treated differently than adult consumers’ data, but businesses can only treat data differently if they know that a consumer is under 17. This amendment created different definitions of what is considered “knowledge” that a consumer is under 17 depending on the size of the business.\n\nExclusion for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children\n\nThis amendment ensured that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children can work with children’s data legally. Without access to this data, the center would otherwise be unable to complete its mission of fighting child trafficking, abuse, and abduction.\n\nCriticisms of the ADPPA\n\nThe ADPPA is far from perfect, but it would also be better than nothing. Legislators naturally differ in whether they focus more on its flaws or its strengths.\n\nPrimarily, critics are concerned about the bill’s enforcement.\n\nWhile the ADPPA allows for civil enforcement through its private right of action, it does not have significant administrative enforcement. The GDPR, for instance, has dedicated data protection authorities that mete out penalties; under the ADPPA, enforcement would fall to either the FTC or state attorneys general, both of which have much more than just data privacy enforcement on their plates.\n\nIt additionally preempts other state laws with greater or lesser enforcement and coverage. The amendment to permit the CPPA to be the ADPPA enforcer in California was a compromise to ensure that the state wouldn’t be subject to weak enforcement if the CPRA were to be replaced by the ADPPA. But the ADPPA would also preempt states with more business-friendly data privacy laws, like Utah’s. That, in turn, has upset the more business-minded members of Congress.\n\nWhat’s Next for the ADPPA?\n\nAs of this writing, the ADPPA has successfully passed through the House committee, where it received the amendments described above. Now, it has to pass a vote in the House.\n\nIf it passes a vote, then the bill will be introduced in the Senate, where it will go into the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation for study. If the committee approves of the bill, then it will go to the Senate floor for a vote, and after that, to President Biden’s desk.\n\nWhat Are Its Chances?",
      "# [Who is Helen Nissenbaum? by Osano Staff on 2021-07-30](https://www.osano.com/articles/nissenbaum)\nHere at Osano, we name our major product feature releases after privacy heroes. Here's why our July feature release, Text Customization for Consent Manager, is named after Helen Nissenbaum.\n\nOne of the reasons it can be difficult for people to understand their privacy rights or for companies to make intelligent decisions is that privacy isn't easily defined. That's why Helen Nissenbaum's contribution to privacy theory is so significant.\n\nNissenbaum developed one of the most critical theoretical underpinnings for regulating data uses. While the U.S. framework currently relies on giving users \"notice\" and \"choice\" when companies seek to collect their data, Nissenbaum's work says that instead, the focus should be on \"contextual integrity.\"\n\nUsing contextual integrity means companies should evaluate whether the personal data they're collecting will be used in ways other than the initial purpose for which it was collected. Things can get slippery for companies sometimes in defining a customer's \"reasonable\" expectation of how you'll treat their data. Let's say you collect data from a customer to provide them a service, and then you want to sell that data to a company seeking to serve personalized ads. The Contextual Integrity Theory would say that you need to look at whether the customer would reasonably expect the data to be used for this purpose in light of the overall context in which they provided that data. Telling customers that you do this in a privacy policy may help, but it may not be enough on its own given that we know customers don't generally read the privacy policy and wouldn't likely expect their data to be used for this purpose.\n\nA real-life example of this might be helpful here. Think about Facebook's News Feed feature, which debuted in 2006 and \"fed\" users real-time updates on what their friends were posting; whether they'd broken up with their boyfriends and if they'd added any new connections, among other notifications. Not everyone liked the intrusion. One million people joined a \"Facebook News Feed protest group.\"\n\nThe crux of the problem was that users didn't expect Facebook to peer so closely into their lives and display that to their online connections. Offline, we understand how much privacy we expect based on context. If I close the door to my office, everyone understands I want space and privacy. If I'm sitting at a cafe, close to a friend and chatting quietly, no one would assume it'd be fine to stand nearby and cock an ear our way. But online, that context is difficult to perceive. So when Facebook's News Feed displays broadly that I broke up with my boyfriend, it feels invasive suddenly. Just because I signed up for Facebook and clicked \"yes\" to whatever I had to so I could join doesn't mean I'm expecting my personal details to be treated like a news scroll on cable TV.\n\nIn their article, “Contextual gaps: Privacy issues on Facebook,” Gordon Hull, Celine Latulipe and Heather Richter Lopfod write, \"Offline, privacy is mediated by highly granular social contexts. Online contexts, including social networking sites, lack much of this granularity. These contextual gaps are at the root of many of the sites' privacy issues.\"\n\nAnd that's what Nissenbaum would have advised Facebook to avoid out of respect for consumer privacy. (In the end, Facebook ignored the protests and the feature lives on.) In an age when companies often seem more interested in dodging liability than gaining customer trust, Nissenbaum's theory asks companies to do better. A contextual integrity framework looks at the data-use holistically. It requires data collectors to take an ethical approach that considers societal norms, which will always evolve. It asks data collectors to look at the context of the situation to determine what that \"norm\" is. Is the data subject in this context a patient? An online shopper? An existing customer? Is the data collector an online retailer? A doctor? What kind of information is being collected, and how will it be used? Once you take all of those factors into account, you can start to apply what the societal \"norm\" would be in the context at hand.\n\nIf Facebook looked at its plans through a contextual integrity lens, it likely would have decided the News Feed didn't align with users' expectations in joining the site and forking over their data.\n\nIn addition to her ethical contributions to the field, Nissenbaum, a professor of information science at Cornell Tech in New York City, is also director of the Digital Life Initiative. Launched in 2017, it aims to study the \"societal tensions arising from existing and emerging digital technologies. It takes into consideration ethics, policy, politics and quality of life.\n\nAmong other accolades, Nissenbaum received the International Association for Computing and Philosophy's 2021 Covey Award for her contributions to computing, ethics and philosophy.\n\nHer books include Obfuscation: A User's Guide to Privacy and Protest; Values at Play in Digital Games; and Privacy in Context: Technology, Policy and the Integrity of Social Life.",

      "# [Building Compliance into Marketing Operations Puts Privacy First by Cait Ward on 2024-06-06](https://www.osano.com/customers/lattice)\nLattice uses Osano to eliminate operational complexity, align marketing and compliance teams, and fulfill its promise of being a privacy-first organization.\n\nReduced Work Cycle Time: Cut the compliance activities cycle time from weeks to hours.\n\nSimplified Compliance: Lowered risk and simplified processes associated with constantly changing domestic and global privacy laws.\n\nEnhanced Collaboration: Improved communication and collaboration between marketing operations and compliance teams. ​​\n\nImproved Efficiency: The marketing team now finds it quicker and more straightforward to understand and organize consent data.\n\nEnhanced Insights: Enabled marketing to contextualize cookie opt-out rates with traffic sources, distinguishing between true direct traffic and untracked paid traffic.\n\nBetter Decision Making: Improved capability to analyze spikes in direct traffic alongside paid programs, leading to more accurate traffic and conversion assessments.\n\nAbout\n\nLattice is a leading people management platform empowering high-performing teams with simplified HR operations. Its AI-enhanced people platform helps companies improve workplace performance, increase engagement, and better track and analyze people data. As a privacy-first organization, customer data privacy and transparency about data and its usage are top priorities for Lattice.\n\nChallenge\n\nAn inefficiency and lack of flexibility complicates compliance and data management\n\nBy the time suggestions were made and implemented, it was time for the next month's review all over again.\n\nWeisi Kang Head of Marketing Operations, Lattice\n\nWith over 5,000 organizations relying on its people operations platform, Lattice handles a large amount of sensitive data. Guaranteeing privacy while managing user consent is a requirement and a core commitment for both the compliance team and marketing operations.\n\nHowever, the company’s existing data privacy solution hindered rather than helped its privacy program. Inefficiency, a lack of flexibility, and the potential for error raised the risk of non-compliance. “Our previous solution required a tremendous amount of time to manage,” said Charlie Voelker, Director of Compliance at Lattice. “We had to make many compromises because it lacked the configurability and customization we needed.”\n\nMonthly reports rather than real-time data made it difficult for marketing operations to monitor and organize the cookies, tools, and scripts deployed across the website in a continuous and timely manner.\n\nThe team struggled with frustrations due to the inability of their existing software to create dynamic, configurable banners for all regions that would enable them to fine-tune each banner to address specific laws and regulations, or even adapt to changes as they developed; having to frequently update these banners to keep up with evolving privacy laws added another layer of effort and complexity.\n\nOften, the solution would revert to old versions of banners and language following the report cycle, causing frustration, rework, and increased vulnerability to human error.\n\nThe marketing operations team lacked the tools necessary to properly organize available data to extract analytics and insights when a user gave permissions to use data for marketing reasons.\n\nUltimately, managing the existing consent solution proved so unwieldy that Lattice paid an agency to do it, adding cost, further complicating compliance management, and creating an unacceptable lag time between communication and action.\n\n“By the time suggestions were made and implemented, it was time for next month’s review all over again,” said Weisi Kang, Head of Marketing Operations at Lattice.\n\nThe company needed a consent management solution that would empower teams to achieve its mission of Privacy First.\n\nOur previous solution required a tremendous amount of time to manage. We had to make many compromises because it lacked the configurability and customization that we needed.\n\nCharlie Voelker Director of Compliance, Lattice\n\nSolution\n\nMore Powerful Consent Management with Less Effort\n\nLattice chose Osano Cookie Consent because the solution’s automation and customization features could help the company streamline privacy operations, reduce compliance risk, and better organize and understand cookie data.\n\n\"Our decision to partner with Osano was grounded not just in the features and functionality of their solutions, but also in how well they align with our approach to privacy,” said Charlie Voelker, Director of Compliance at Lattice. “We view privacy not merely as a regulatory requirement, but as a priority that is fundamental to our business philosophy. This alignment extends to our marketing practices, ensuring they are consistent with both the law and our internal policies. The support from Osano has been instrumental in helping us handle issues like cookie consent, reflecting our commitment to maintaining a privacy-first approach.\"\n\nImplementation took less than two weeks (the previous solution’s implementation took at least twice that long) and the clean interface enabled the team to quickly begin improving their system.\n\nThe team gained real-time visibility into its data privacy ecosystem, enabling them to continuously monitor cookies, scripts, and tools and act quickly if necessary.\n\nLattice also eliminated manual work and rework with the ability to automatically create and update cookie banners based on a user’s geolocation. The compliance team gained peace of mind that cookie banners would be more quickly updated and less prone to human error.\n\nThe team eliminated extensive back-and-forth conversations between compliance and marketing operations teams to determine what new cookies were discovered, how to classify them, what needed to be disclosed, and more. Osano’s real-time site scans, classification suggestions, and customized rules helped streamline consent management between the teams while helping strike a balance between the business need for cookies and analytics with Lattice’s privacy-first philosophy.\n\nTogether, marketing operations and compliance teams could more easily review data and preview banners, enhancing communication and collaboration between the teams.\n\nIn addition, a convenient widget in the new solution empowered end users to take control of their data privacy with the ability to easily review and customize their preferences at any time.\n\nThe tools that we want to invest in must be very flexible, intuitive, and easy for our teams to use. Osano meets all of those needs and more.\n\nWeisi Kang Head of Marketing Operations, Lattice\n\nResults\n\nTaking the pain out of privacy operations\n\nWithin a few months, Lattice has made managing consent and staying in compliance more intuitive and collaborative than ever before. Osano has enabled the company to save hours of work each month and increase accuracy, in addition to giving multiple teams greater visibility into data to benefit the entire business.\n\nLattice has gone from a monthly reporting exercise to real-time data access, with the ability to act on issues and create reports with bi-weekly maintenance instead of weeks of delays. Both the marketing operations team and the compliance team have greater visibility into information on cookies, scripts, and tools.\n\nWith greater visibility into cookie activity, a better system for organizing and prioritizing information, and the ability to automate changes, the Lattice teams have been able to bring privacy management back in-house, reducing agency fees by thousands of dollars per month and eliminating days of lag time between notification and response.\n\nLattice now has greater trust in the accuracy of consent language and preferences on its domestic and global banners, eliminating the need to continuously double-check and rework language and freeing up time for more strategic work.\n\nThe marketing operations team has been able to organize consent data, eliminate data that they are not using, and analyze available data for targeted marketing opportunities.\n\nSince onboarding the Osano solution, the marketing operations team feels empowered to work faster and make better decisions based on clear, visible consent data. They also enjoy a more transparent, collaborative relationship with the compliance team as they work to create a truly privacy-first organization.\n\nOur ability to understand and categorize cookies has been improved with Osano’s support. Both our compliance and marketing teams clearly understand the implications of every privacy decision.\n\nWeisi Kang Head of Marketing Operations, Lattice\n\nLooking to Streamline and Improve Your Privacy Operations?\n\nIf you are looking to better manage user consent, you can contact the Osano team to learn more.

Transparency is crucial—not just for compliance with laws like GDPR, but for building user trust. This means providing clear information on what cookies are used for and ensuring that consent mechanisms are straightforward and user-friendly.\n\nFor practical implementation, leveraging tools from brands like Securiti.ai and OneTrust can simplify the process. Both platforms offer robust solutions for managing cookie consents and ensuring compliance without disrupting user experience. Securiti.ai provides excellent automation capabilities for cookie management that adapt to various regional laws, while OneTrust offers comprehensive consent and preference management solutions that can be tailored to fit different user bases globally.\n\nIntegrating these technologies can help overcome technical challenges, ensuring that cookie consent features work seamlessly within existing systems and do not impact site performance. Whether you're aiming for minimal compliance to keep interfaces clean or striving for full compliance to minimize legal risks, using such tools can provide the necessary support.\n\nIn the end, it's about more than just compliance; it's about ensuring that users feel informed and in control of their data, enhancing their overall experience and trust in your platform.\n\n## Comment ID k62wvqi with +1 score by [(infj-t, Reddit, 2023-10-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17e9gyt/what_are_your_thoughts_on_cookie_compliance/k62wvqi/) (in reply to ID 17e9gyt):\nCookie cutter SaaS solutions for this are an abomination, building it yourself is the best way IMHO, I built one that I reuse, it has two options yes or no, no z-index peril or 'Legitimate Interest' 🤡 nonsense, nor is it bloated or beholden to a third party shortcomings etc\n\n[Also worth a read](https://www.naughtyduk.com/articles/humans-waste-682-years-per-day-on-cookie-notices)\n\n## Comment ID k63hzdu with +1 score by [(FredHerberts_Plant, Reddit, 2023-10-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17e9gyt/what_are_your_thoughts_on_cookie_compliance/k63hzdu/) (in reply to ID 17e9gyt):\n# WE LEAD THE WORLD IN COMPUTERIZED DATA COLLECTION!!!",

Our agents handle everything from defining & implement controls, automatically gathering evidence, and liaising with the auditors back and forth so you and your team doesn't need to (we have a large audit-network who we've negotiated price cuts with since we are also providing them with a touchless process). This saves you a lot of time, since we essentially offer you an entire AI security team to handle compliance.

(Kyuden Hantei near the Shinomen Mori because we're playing togashi dynasty and the owl clan is a thing).\n\nFor travelling speed and modifiers, I generally use the rules present at the Atlas of Rokugan, page 99. The rules there are good enough to go by regarding travel time and pace, but snow and wind only apply reductions for the time travelled.\n\nThe Blood of Osano-wo advantage makes me think there are some serious consequences for travelling during winter on such a rural setting. I'm looking for those consequences. I don't live in a place with snow, so I have a tough time being creative about the rolls or what challenges the players would face. Would their rokugani pony even survive sleeping outside on winter?\n\nI'll greatly appreciate if anyone knows of a ruleset to impose more penalties regarding travelling in such dangerous conditions.\n\nThanks in advance.

Too bad you cannot find It under all this snow.\n\n- wind + snow = reduced visibility.\n\n- have you ever experienced heavy hail pouring down on you? It can hurt!!!\n\n- Infections!! Make someone ill!!\n\n- Mess with their equipment: paper gets soaked and might even break, wooden absorbs the humidity, the Katana might be harder to unsheathe. Their clothes might lose their color.

Traveling pouches for scrolls are often oilskin and sealed - these can freeze shut. Leather will become brittle and snap without proper care. Their horses will have to forge a path if it's a less travelled road, which means getting exhausted much quicker plowing through snow. So much so that the horse will not be able to carry a rider - if a PC does this, they will have to take the exhausted condition and trade places with another. If they are sensible, they will stop for a few days to a few weeks while the roads get cleared (more rural areas will take longer) before moving on.\n\n## The biggest threats of all that no one has mentioned\n- Yuki onba \n- Yuki jiji\n- Yuki warashi(cute) and yukinbo(deadly)\n- Yukinba and yukifuriba\n- Tsurara onna\n- Oshiroi baba\n- Yuki onna (not always dangerous)\n\nAll the snow yōkai from Japanese mythology (because they have many) are an excellent way to run an encounter. It also leaves plenty of room for interpretation. Do they recognize it? Does someone warn them? If it's not common in cities, and they're all city dwellers, this could spell disaster for them. Or a curse. Or two. If they try to spurn a helpful yōkai, they could face horrible consequences. If they try to help a spiteful one, they could face even worse.\n\nHave some fun with it. Throw in some supernatural phenomenon. If they have no priest, make it *really* obvious they can't handle this. I ran an onryō for my party and left it at \"you can't harm this\" despite them having a shugenja, because I wanted them to find the murderer of the spirit and set it to rest. It wanted vengeance more than it wanted their deaths.

One member of the party still tried several times to kill the ghost. The other method was to usually have her target other people rather than the party.

I described the house growing dim, the sounds of the brook next to it and the birds fading away to nothing, even their own noises seemed muffled and quiet. One player stepped back outside, noise returned with a blast.  The room fell to dark as they discovered grisly clues. The shugenja invoked Amaterasu's Gaze on their pet chick. I told them \"you know you succeeded, you can feel the kami answer your call, but no light is cast. The chick peeps worriedly in your hands.\" When they saw the dark figure wreathed in unnatural light, it reached forth to grasp at them. \"You feel every nerve in your body turn to fire, as if claws strip through your flesh but you feel no blood has been drawn\" then was unfazed by the steel sword cutting through the spectral image. I let them fight/avoid it for two rounds while a priest banished it from the house. Then the house returned to normal and there was sunlight streaming in.\n\nWhen they faced another one whose spirit could not be laid to rest with justice, that's when damage could be done. Sadly the shugenja was gone, so only the player with an ancient chokutō could do anything significant to it. L5R 5e onryō are no joke, and I have a flair for the dramatic 😅\n\n## Comment ID iw6xl2c with +2 score by [(BitRunr, Reddit, 2022-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rokugan/comments/ytzi6x/winter_and_dangerous_travelling_rules/iw6xl2c/) (in reply to ID ytzi6x):\n>The Blood of Osano-wo advantage makes me think there are some serious consequences for travelling during winter on such a rural setting.\n\nJust to say; yes, Winter in Rokugan is so harsh, wars stop and samurai mostly hunker down around a palace.\n\n## Comment ID iw92osi with +2 score by [(Belgand, Reddit, 2022-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rokugan/comments/ytzi6x/winter_and_dangerous_travelling_rules/iw92osi/) (in reply to ID ytzi6x):\nOne of the things that people tend to ignore here is that it's not *just* physical issues, it's how those interact with cultural ones. Traveling in Rokugan, particularly for the samurai class, generally involves staying at inns and road houses, not camping out in the wild. So being able to reach the next waystation on a road is critical to the entire endeavor. That's also affected by the diet since red meat and hunted game aren't commonly eaten by samurai. That means that in winter when fishing and foraging are greatly reduced, you're losing out on primary food sources when in the wilds. Oh sure, *commoners* know how to survive in those situations, but samurai are used to being able to ignore such practical matters.\n\nOn another note, it also depends on how much of your game is focused on travel and survival. If that's a major theme, then go for it! However, many L5R games tend to gloss over travel with more focus on what happens once you get to where you're going. There it might make more sense for it to be a challenge to go anywhere (e.g. can't rent those glossed over horses, porters, guides, etc. that make samurai travel possible for any price) that effectively puts down the narrative roadblock without delving into the minutiae of it. Or make travel difficult, but possible with longer times to travel around and descriptions of how it's an arduous journey, but still just accepting that it happens off-screen and was miserable. So rather than a game effect to be battled and overcome, it's a narrative problem that shapes how NPCs will respond and what options are available to the PCs.\n\nFast-forwarding past winter or resolving much of it with a \"bottle episode\" scenario or two that takes place among the people trapped in that environment (the context for tons of mysteries, horror, dramas, and romances) would also be an excellent way to acknowledge winter without getting too deeply into it.\n\nThat said, even with that approach a brief \"combat encounter\" or two with the weather might go a long way towards explaining to the players exactly *why* they're not going out any time soon.\n\nMore than anything, thanks for bringing up the topic in the first place. As it is in real life, winter is fast approaching in my campaign as well as the party sets out for the Shinomen in late fall, and I've been considering how I want to deal with it.",

I dropped the game after max lvl because I think I got overwhelmed and lost about what do to next. \n\nAfter Steam release, the game came to my radar once again and I decided to give another try and I'm having so much more fun now. I leveled another character (this time a Necromancer!!!) and now I'm facing the same walls again, but I'm not intending to give up like before. Since I'm not in a guild yet i'm relying on watching videos and read guides.\n\nBut one thing I'm really confused is about HP in expansion areas. I really want to unlock the Reaper but need a lot more HP to do so. I read the expansion areas gives u 10 points per challenge but they aren't soloable. Then I discovered about the HP trains that happens often on LFG. \n\nToday I saw one train on LFG but I was scared to join thinking this could be only for vets and their alts. So I'm here to ask for the next time I see one in LFG.\n\nThose trains usually accept new players or have any reqs besides Raptor and Gliding (I have both)? I need to have all waypoints in HoT unlocked before joining one in order to not be a burden and delay the others? Need to complete all the story there in advance? \n\nThanks and sorry for my bad english (it's not my first language).\n\nEDIT: After reading y'all comments here I got the courage to join into Aixxel The Defender train and got all HoT HPs. He was nice and patient for over 2 hours and this prob was one of the best experiences I've had in a MMO for a long time. Everyone running, dying and chatting was really fun.

Zander falls into this category, so he's not a good choice for newbies. I tend to need a few TP to friends and I'm not new. (Kinda clumsy though.) I'm not criticizing. I have fun following him.\n\nTypically all you'll need is basic gliding and raptor. Springer can be handy though the commander will tell you what's expected. I've never seen one advertised that requires griffon.\n\n### Comment ID in3vcbm with +1 score by [(TiakerAvelonna, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/x5wfo4/about_hp_trains/in3vcbm/) (in reply to ID in3t4q3):\nSquad for HP Train (whoever that is) is also speedy.

Some may require \"base raptor and glider\" or some of the HP nodes will require a mastery to access.\n\nA good commander will call these out so you can hang back and not die due to environmental effects you can't bypass yet, but just ask what the base requirements are for the train and they can tell you if they didn't advertise what it was!\n\nI will say one downside to doing an HP Train is that when you're done and you max out your shiny new spec, you didn't do so gradually, so, you got a lot of new stuff to learn at once and consider. There are guides tho.\n\n## Comment ID in41lp9 with +1 score by [(Swekyde, Reddit, 2022-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/x5wfo4/about_hp_trains/in41lp9/) (in reply to ID x5wfo4):\nI have yet to see an HP Train that assumes you have more than a Raptor and a Glider. They will assume you have awareness however; so pay attention and don't get distracted clicking on nodes or you will fall behind. Osano aka Squad For HP Train (done up to look like Saitama from One Punch Man) calls when he's going to put down Portals for people and most of the time when I see newbies get lost it's because they ignored him indicating he was going to do that, attempted to follow on the route that needed a mastery/mount they didn't have, and then not figure out how to get back to where the portal is.\n\n## Comment ID in4ltc1 with +1 score by [(rzalexander, Reddit, 2022-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/x5wfo4/about_hp_trains/in4ltc1/) (in reply to ID x5wfo4):\nMost HP trains (with few exceptions) should be welcoming for new players.

Most hero points actually are soloable by a good chunk of the player base, but some are definitely hard enough you couldnt be faulted for not being able to do it. But it is within reason that once you're comfortable and more experienced (and properly geared) you could solo pretty much all HPs. Especially as this is your first elite spec. Remember after you've unlocked reaper, you can use it to do HPs in PoF or EoD if you later want to unlock harbinger or scourge. Not like you have to go back to core necro to do that.\n\nHP train squads usually have a squad message once you join that will give some details about when it starts, what is required,etc. Most HP trains are super casual (and thus very slow) but some are faster. But read the message,and leave if it doesn't match what you can do. For pretty much any open world content it's OK to ask questions. Maybe for stuff like raids yeah don't join a squad you don't know and randomly ask them what it is and what they're doing (tho tbh I feel like lots of parties would let you down politely)but for open world squads, give'er.\n\n## Comment ID in5ddtj with +1 score by [(Davosz_, Reddit, 2022-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/x5wfo4/about_hp_trains/in5ddtj/) (in reply to ID x5wfo4):\nThe people who run them will list what is required. Usually its a raptor mount and glider. Besides that, they make pathing very clear and easy to follow. \n\nThey also often wait to kill a HP again if people miss it. If you miss one, no stress, just move along to catch up with the group via the commanders tag.\n\nThe experience is very newbie friendly though.\n\nNote on glider and raptor. These are obtained at the start of the Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire xpacs respectively. They are relatively quick and easy to obtain so the barrier to entry on the HP trains is actually pretty low.\n\nFor guides on Glider and Raptor, I'm sure there are plenty of youtube clips around that give a quick rundown...\n\n## Comment ID in5dtmf with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-09-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/x5wfo4/about_hp_trains/in5dtmf/) (in reply to ID x5wfo4):\nI remember joining weekly HP trains in HoT with only a glider and a base raptor (a friend helped me getting it from the first PoF quest for convenience) and people put mesmer teleports to help me.

      "# [Data Privacy Laws: What You Need to Know in 2024 by Osano Staff on 2024-08-12](https://www.osano.com/articles/data-privacy-laws)\nVirtually every country has enacted some sort of data privacy law to regulate how information is collected, how data subjects are informed, and what control a data subject has over their information once it is transferred. Failure to follow applicable data privacy laws may lead to fines, lawsuits, and even prohibiting a site's use in certain jurisdictions. Navigating these laws and regulations can be daunting, but all website operators should be familiar with data privacy laws that affect their users.\n\nNew and Upcoming Data Privacy Laws in 2024\n\nIt's important to remain cognizant of existing data privacy laws, but perhaps you just want to review what's new in 2024 and beyond. Some of these laws are already in effect in 2024, will go into effect this year, or have relevant dates in the future.\n\nU.S. Data Privacy Laws\n\nDespite numerous proposals over the years, no one comprehensive federal law governs data privacy in the U.S. yet. As of this writing, the American Privacy Rights Act has been introduced in Congress. It still faces significant hurdles before it can ultimately be enacted into law, however.\n\nIn the meantime, however, individual states have acted rather than wait on the federal government. There's a complex patchwork of sector-specific and medium-specific laws, including laws and regulations that address telecommunications, health information, credit information, financial institutions, and marketing.\n\nThe FTC\n\nAn important enforcement agency in the U.S. is the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Its authority to regulate on behalf of consumer protections comes from The Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), which has broad jurisdiction over commercial entities under its authority to prevent unfair or \"deceptive trade practices.\"\n\nWhile the FTC uses its authority to issue regulations, enforce privacy laws, and take enforcement actions to protect consumers. For example, the FTC might take impose action against organizations that:\n\nFail to implement and maintain reasonable data security measures\n\nFail to abide by any applicable self-regulatory principles of the organization's industry\n\nFail to follow a published privacy policy\n\nTransfer personal information in a manner not disclosed in the privacy policy\n\nMake inaccurate privacy and security representations (i.e., lying) to consumers and in privacy policies\n\nFail to provide sufficient security for personal data\n\nViolate consumer data privacy rights by collecting, processing, or sharing consumer information\n\nEngage in misleading advertising practices\n\nOther federal laws that govern the collection of information online include:\n\nThe Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which governs the collection of information about minors\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act (HIPAA), which governs the collection of health information\n\nThe Gramm Leach Bliley Act (GLBA), which governs personal information collected by banks and financial institutions\n\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which regulates the collection and use of credit information\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which protects the privacy of student education records\n\nState Privacy Laws\n\nThe U.S. also has hundreds of sectoral data privacy and data security laws among its states. State attorneys general oversee data privacy laws governing the collection, storage, safeguarding, disposal, and use of personal data collected from their residents, especially regarding data breach notifications and the security of Social Security numbers. Some apply only to governmental entities, others to private entities, and others apply to both.\n\nIn addition to sectoral privacy laws, the U.S. is experiencing a massive drive toward pushing privacy legislation at the state level. That’s because the federal government hasn’t been able to find a consensus on how to legislate broadly. Rather than wait, state lawmakers have been nudged by consumers, consumer advocates, and even companies to set their own rules.\n\nOf course, companies would rather comply with a single federal standard than hire attorneys and privacy professionals, invest in compliance tools, and establish a robust compliance program that covers all applicable state laws. But states see the lack of any data privacy protections as more damaging than overly complex data privacy protections.\n\nStarting with 2023's state privacy laws and moving into 2024 and beyond, here’s a breakdown of where things stand.\n\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)\n\nThe most comprehensive state data privacy legislation to date is the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). The CPRA was passed by a ballot initiative in November 2020 and amended California’s previous state privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). It went into effect on January 1, 2023.\n\nThe CPRA is cross-sector legislation that introduces important definitions and broad individual consumer rights and imposes substantial duties on entities or persons that collect personal information about or from a California resident. These duties include informing data subjects when and how data is collected; allowing them to opt-out of data collection; allowing them to access, correct, and delete such information; and restricting how businesses can transfer personal information to other entities.\n\nMany of the above requirements were also included in the CCPA, but once the CPRA passed, the law was amended to include the following:\n\nRight to rectification: This updates and adds to a consumer’s right to correct inaccurate personal information.\n\nRight to restriction: This grants consumers the right to limit the use and disclosure of their sensitive personal information.\n\nSensitive personal information: This updates the definition of personal information. Certain types of information, like a consumer’s Social Security number, must be treated with special protections.\n\nThe CPRA also:\n\nIncreased fines for breaches of children’s data threefold\n\nExpanded breach liability beyond breaches of unencrypted data to disclosures of credentials (like an email address or password) that could lead to access to a consumer’s account\n\nLimited the duration of time a company may retain a consumer’s information to only what’s necessary and “proportionate” to the reason it was collected in the first place\n\nRequires companies working with third parties, contractors, and outside service providers to contractually mandate that those organizations exercise the same level of privacy protection to data shared with them as the first party\n\nOne of the most significant features of the CPRA is its enforcement. While state attorneys general typically handle privacy cases—unless the FTC is involved, and even then, it’s often a partnership—the CPRA establishes a new privacy regulator.\n\nThe California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) can fine transgressors, hold hearings about privacy violations, and clarify privacy guidelines. It’s a five-member board, and it starts enforcing six months after the CPRA goes into effect on July 1, 2023.\n\nVirginia's Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA)\n\nVirginia's Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA) was passed on March 2, 2021. It grants Virginia consumers certain rights over their data and requires companies covered by the law to comply with rules on the data they collect, how it's treated and protected, and with whom it's shared.\n\nThe law contains some similarities to the EU General Data Protection Regulation's (GDPR) provisions and the CPRA. It applies to entities that do business in Virginia or sell products and services targeted to Virginia residents and also meet one of the following:\n\nControl or process the personal data of 100,000 or more\n\nControl or process the personal data of at least 25,000 consumers and earn 50% of their revenue by selling personal information\n\nThe CDPA requires companies covered by the law to assist consumers in exercising their data rights by obtaining opt-in consent before processing their sensitive data (non-sensitive data may be collected so long as the consumer is notified), disclosing when their data will be sold, and allowing them to opt-out of data collection. It also requires companies to provide users with a clear privacy notice that enables consumers to opt-out of targeted advertising. In addition, it requires data brokers to honor consumers’ requests to opt out of data processing, among other requirements.\n\nThe CDPA went into effect on January 1, 2023.\n\nColorado Privacy Act (CPA)\n\nIn June 2020, Colorado became the third U.S. state to pass a privacy law. The Colorado Privacy Act grants Colorado residents rights over their data and places obligations on data controllers and processors. It contains some similarities to California's CPRA, Virginia's CDPA, and the EU’s GDPR.\n\nWhile there are similarities, such as some form of a right to opt-out, special protections for sensitive data, and the adoption of some privacy-by-design principles, the significant differences are in the details.\n\nThe CPA applies to businesses that collect personal data from 100,000 Colorado residents or collect data from 25,000 Colorado residents and derive revenue from the sale of that data.\n\nThe law lists five rights granted to Colorado residents once the law becomes effective on July 1, 2023. They are:\n\nThe right to opt-out of targeted ads, the sale of their personal data, or being profiled\n\nThe right to access the data a company has collected about them\n\nThe right to correct data that's been collected about them\n\nThe right to request the data collected about them is deleted\n\nThe right to data portability (that is, the right to take your data and move it to another company)\n\nThere are 17 blanket exemptions within the law. Data exemptions include:\n\nIf the data was collected for Colorado health insurance law purposes\n\nIf the entity collecting the data or the data collected is already covered by certain sectoral laws, including COPPA or the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\n\nIf the data has been de-identified or pseudonymized\n\nIf the data is being maintained and used by a consumer reporting agency\n\nIf the data is being used for employment records purposes\n\nSince the law goes into effect midway through 2023, businesses should expect updates to the law via rulemaking in the first half of the year.\n\nUtah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA)\n\nIn March 2022, Utah became the fourth state to enact a comprehensive consumer privacy law, which will take effect on December 31, 2023. The Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA) draws from the CDPA, CPA, and CPRA.\n\nThe law applies to both data controllers and processors that generate over $25 million in annual revenue and either:\n\nControl or process personal data for over 100,000 consumers yearly, or\n\nDerive over 50% of the entity’s gross revenue from the sale of personal data and controls or processes the personal data of 25,000 or more consumers.\n\nSimilarly to the statutes in Colorado and Virginia, there are exemptions for certain types of personal data; however, they’re broader at both the entity and data levels.\n\nThe law does not apply to governmental entities or third parties acting on behalf of a governmental entity, tribes, institutions of higher education, nonprofit corporations, business associates, information that meets the definition of protected health information for HIPAA and related regulations, and more.\n\nFinancial institutions governed by the GLBA (the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) and information in the FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act) also aren’t subject to the UCPA. Data processed or maintained in the course of employment is also exempt.\n\nConsumers have the right to:\n\nConfirm whether a controller is processing their personal data and accessing or deleting personal data provided\n\nObtain a copy of their personal data in a portable, accessible format\n\nOpt-out of processing of personal data for targeted advertising or sale\n\nIn contrast to the CDPA and CPA, the UCPA does not include the right to opt-out of profiling nor codify the right to correct inaccuracies in their data.\n\nConnecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA)\n\nConnecticut's fifth and most recent state to adopt a comprehensive consumer privacy law. Senate Bill 6, or “An Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring” (CTDPA), went into effect July 1, 2023.\n\nThe law also draws from Virginia and Colorado’s statutes, with a few departures. It applies to businesses that, during the preceding calendar year:\n\nControlled or processed personal data of 100,000 or more Connecticut residents, excluding residents whose personal data is controlled or processed solely to complete a payment transaction; or\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of not less than 25,000 consumers and derived more than 25% of their gross revenue from the sale of personal data.\n\nThe law is the first to specify that payment transaction data is not subject to the law, which is for small businesses that process information to complete a transaction, such as restaurants. Consumers can opt out of data processing for the purposes of targeted advertisements, sale to a third party, and profiling.\n\nThe state allows a 60-day period to remedy violations through December 31, 2024.\n\nMontana Consumer Data Privacy Act (MTCDPA)\n\nMontana Governor Greg Gianforte signed the Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act (MTCDPA) into law on May 19, 2023. However, the law does not go into effect until October 1, 2024.\n\nThe MTCDPA applies to any data controller that handles the personal data of at least 50,000 Montana residents, except for data used exclusively for payment transactions. Additionally, controllers that manage personal data from at least 25,000 consumers and derive more than 25% of their revenue from selling personal data also must comply with the law. Notably, there is no revenue threshold associated with the MTCDPA.\n\nUnder the law, Montanans have the right to opt out of the sale of their personal data, the right to know if a controller is processing their personal information and access to that data, the right to request the correction of inaccurate or outdated information, the right to ask a controller to delete their personal data, the right to portability, and the right to not be discriminated against for exercising their rights.\n\nThe MTCDPA includes the usual range of exemptions, including government agencies, nonprofits, higher education institutions, national securities associations registered under the Securities Exchange Act, organizations governed by GLBA, and organizations subject to HIPAA.\n\nOne of the more unique features of the law is that it doesn't specify a particular dollar amount for fines or other statutory damages for breaking the law. It simply states that the Attorney General can take legal action. Businesses will also have a 60-day cure period to address any violations, though this period expires April 1, 2026.\n\nTennessee Information Protection Act (TIPA)\n\nThe Tennessee Information Protection Act (TIPA), signed into law in May 2023 and effective from July 1, 2025, positions Tennessee among states taking proactive steps in consumer privacy. The TIPA applies to businesses exceeding $25 million in revenue that engage with Tennessee or its residents and either:\n\nControl or process the personal information of at least 175,000 consumers.\n\nControl or process the personal information of at least 25,000 consumers and derive more than 50 percent of gross revenue from the sale of personal information.\n\nConsumer rights under TIPA include the ability to confirm, access, correct, delete, and obtain personal information. The law places responsibilities on data controllers, emphasizing data minimization, security practices, and non-discrimination.\n\nIn contrast with other state laws, the TIPA provides a narrower applicability threshold, a generous two-plus-year on-ramp period for businesses, and an affirmative defense option for those with written privacy programs aligned with specified frameworks like NIST. In this circumstance, an affirmative defense helps protect businesses against liability. Because of these and other unique features, the TIPA is one of the more business-friendly U.S. privacy laws.\n\nEnforcement falls under the state attorney general, with a 60-day cure period for violators. Penalties may include fines up to $7,500 per violation, with the potential for tripled damages for willful violations.\n\nOregon Consumer Privacy Act (OCPA)\n\nThe Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (OCPA) represents Oregon's response to the absence of a federal privacy law. Signed into law in July 2023, the OCPA is set to become effective on July 1, 2024, concurrently with Texas's privacy law. The law applies to businesses conducting operations in Oregon or providing services to its residents and either:\n\nControl or process the personal data of 100,000 or more consumers.\n\nControl or process the personal data of 25,000 or more consumers while deriving a quarter or more of their annual gross revenue from selling personal data.\n\nNotable exemptions to the OCPA involve information governed by acts like HIPAA and GLBA like other state laws. However, the OCPA is distinct that entities subject to these acts must still comply with the OCPA for non-covered data. The law grants consumers the usual rights, including access, correction, deletion, and opt-out options for targeted advertising or profiling. Controllers must respond to requests within 45 days, extendable by an additional 45 days, and provide justification for any rejection.\n\nUnique features of the OCPA include its data-level exemptions for HIPAA and GLBA (as opposed to entity-level exemptions) and its broad definition of sensitive data. The OCPA includes the usual items under the umbrella of sensitive data, but also includes data types like an individual’s status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, and more.\n\nEnforcement falls under the state attorney general, with potential fines up to $7,500 per violation. Unlike some state laws, the OCPA incorporates a 30-day right to cure, a five-year statute of limitations, and provisions for additional fees if the attorney general prevails in an action.\n\nTexas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA)\n\nThe Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA), signed into law on June 18, 2023, by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, positions Texas as the second-largest state (after California) to enact a comprehensive data privacy law.\n\nUnique aspects of the TDPSA include a deviation from traditional applicability criteria, replacing revenue-based thresholds with a focus on businesses conducting operations in Texas and offer products or services consumed by Texas residents, or businesses that process or sell personal data. Notably, it introduces a novel small business provision, and while exclusions exist for entities such as state agencies and financial institutions, the law does not provide a general exemption for entities governed by HIPAA or GLBA, requiring compliance for non-covered data.\n\nConsumer rights granted by the TDPSA align with common privacy laws, allowing residents to confirm, correct, delete, and obtain copies of their personal data, along with opting out of targeted advertising or data sale. The law becomes enforceable on July 1, 2024, with businesses gaining a grace period until January 1, 2025, to comply with the global opt-out technology provision. A distinctive feature is the perpetual 30-day cure period, allowing violators to rectify breaches and avoid penalties by providing the attorney general with evidence of compliance.\n\nThe TDPSA introduces unique provisions, such as additional disclosures for companies selling sensitive or biometric information, and explicit notices for data sale on targeted advertising.\n\nThe law is enforceable by the state attorney general, who can issue fines of up to $7,500 per violation.\n\nIowa Consumer Data Protection Act (ICDPA)\n\nThe Iowa Consumer Data Protection Act (ICDPA) was signed into law in late March, 2023, by Governor Kim Reynolds, and goes into effect on January 1, 2025.\n\nThe ICDPA applies to businesses controlling or processing the personal data of at least 100,000 Iowa consumers or 25,000 consumers with over 50% of gross revenue from data sales. Exemptions include data regulated by the FCRA, state agencies, financial institutions under GLBA, and entities complying with HIPAA.\n\nConsumer rights under the ICDPA include confirmation of data processing, deletion rights, access to personal data, and the right to opt out of data sales. While similar to other state laws, ICDPA notably lacks explicit provisions for the right to correct personal data and the right to opt out of profiling. In response to consumers exercising their rights, the law sets a 90-day timeline for responses and requires businesses to provide information free of charge up to twice annually per consumer.\n\nEnforcement, managed by the state attorney general, incorporates a perpetual 90-day cure period for violators before fines of $7,500 per violation are imposed. The ICDPA does not grant a private right of action.\n\nIndiana Consumer Data Protection Act (INCDPA)\n\nThe Indiana Consumer Data Protection Act (INCDPA) became the seventh state to adopt a privacy law on May 1, 2023. Effective from January 1, 2026, the INCDPA follows the footsteps of similar state laws, emphasizing consumer rights and establishing guidelines for data safeguarding.\n\nThe INCDPA applies to businesses operating in Indiana or selling products and services to Indiana residents that control or process personal data of either 100,000 or 25,000 Indiana residents. Unlike other data privacy laws, the INCDPA doesn't solely rely on a revenue threshold, requiring compliance even if annual gross revenues fall below a specific limit.\n\nConsumer rights granted by the INCDPA include the ability to correct data inaccuracies; opt out of targeted advertising, data sales, or specific profiling; confirm data processing; and request the deletion of personal data. Exemptions exclude state entities, affiliates of financial institutions, organizations subject to HIPAA, non-profit entities, higher education institutions, and public utility entities. Controllers must adhere to principles like data minimization, implement security measures, and conduct data protection impact assessments (DPIA) for specific data processing activities. These include targeted advertising, data sale, profiling with foreseeable risks, processing of sensitive data, and other activities with heightened risk.\n\nEnforcement of the INCDPA involves a 30-day cure period for alleged violations before civil penalties of up to $7,500 per violation are imposed. The attorney general oversees enforcement and may grant injunctive relief. The law emphasizes a business-friendly approach, providing a substantial window for compliance preparation.\n\nDelaware Personal Data Privacy Act (DPDPA)\n\nDelaware joined the growing list of U.S. states enacting comprehensive data privacy legislation with the Delaware Personal Data Privacy Act (DPDPA), positioned as one of the nation's most robust data privacy bills. While California still holds the title for the strongest data privacy law, the DPDPA is notable for its consumer-friendly approach and broader applicability, encompassing businesses of varying sizes. Set to take effect on January 1, 2025, the law grants an additional year for businesses to implement universal opt-out mechanisms in 2026.\n\nApplicability under the DPDPA is extensive, covering any company conducting business in Delaware or offering products/services targeting state residents. The thresholds for compliance are set at processing the personal data of at least 35,000 consumers or 10,000 consumers with over 20% of gross revenue derived from personal data sales. Notably, the 35,000-consumer threshold is the lowest among existing data privacy laws, making the DPDPA applicable to a broader range of small and medium-sized companies.\n\nExemptions under the DPDPA include government bodies, financial institutions subject to the GLBA, and various types of data, such as protected health information under HIPAA. Consumer rights align with other state laws, encompassing the right to confirm and access personal data, correct inaccuracies, delete data, obtain data copies, receive a list of third-party disclosures, and opt-out of targeted advertising, data sale, or profiling. Controllers are obliged to limit data collection to what is necessary, implement security measures, and obtain opt-in consent for sensitive data or data of known children.\n\nEnforcement falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice, allowing a cure period for violators, albeit with a sunset provision ending on January 1, 2026. The Department may investigate and prosecute violations, potentially resulting in penalties up to $10,000 per violation. The law also mandates data protection assessments for activities with a heightened risk of harm to consumers, such as targeted advertising or processing sensitive data.\n\nNebraska Data Privacy Act (NDPA)\n\nThe Nebraska Data Privacy Act (NDPA) is a comprehensive data privacy act designed to protect consumers and give them control over their personal information. It grants them certain rights, outlined below, and provides controllers, or the entity that determines the purpose and means of processing personal data, with specific requirements for how to handle data and consumer requests related to their data.\n\nThe law’s scope tracks closely with the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA), including its applicability, sensitive data, and its requirement to honor universal opt-out mechanisms.\n\nLike the TDPSA, Nebraska’s privacy law applies to a person who:\n\nConducts business in the state or produces a product or service consumed by residents of Nebraska;\n\nProcesses or engages in the sale of personal data; and\n\nIs not a small business as determined under the federal Small Business Act.\n\nOne notable aspect of the NDPA’s applicability is that, unlike most other state laws, there is no revenue or volume of data processed.\n\nLike many other comprehensive data privacy laws, the state attorney general has enforcement authority of the data privacy act. The law stipulates that the attorney general must first notify the controller or processor of the violation in writing and provide a 30-day cure period—luckily for Nebraska businesses, this cure period does not sunset, unlike other state data privacy laws.\n\nIn addition to curing the violation, the controller or process must also provide a written statement and supportive documentation to show the violation was cured and stating that they will not commit another violation.\n\nThose who don’t cure a violation during the 30-day timeframe, or who breach their written statement, will be subject to a $7,500 fine for each infraction.\n\nNew Hampshire Privacy Act (NHPA)\n\nThe New Hampshire Privacy Act (NHPA) is one of a number of statewide data privacy laws aimed at giving consumers control over their personal data in an increasingly digital world.\n\nThe good news for businesses is that the NHPA largely resembles other data privacy laws that have come before it. It is most closely aligned to those in Virginia (VCDPA) and Connecticut (CTDPA)—though there are slight nuances.\n\nThe law is slated to take effect January 1, 2025, and will apply to “persons that conduct business” in the state or who produce products or services targeted to residents of New Hampshire and who, during a one-year period:\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of not less than 35,000 unique consumers, excluding if the processing occurred solely to complete a payment transaction, or\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of not less than 10,000 unique consumers and derived more than 25 percent of their gross revenue from the sale of personal data.\n\nThe New Hampshire data privacy act’s scope is somewhat unique in that it doesn’t include a revenue threshold. Additionally, the applicability threshold is lower than other laws, but lawmakers have pointed out that this is because of the state’s lower population.\n\nLike other U.S. laws, the NHPA follows primarily an opt-out model, meaning businesses are free to process consumer data, but must notify consumers about the processing first and give them a way to opt out of the collection or sale of data. There are exceptions, however, for the data of children under the age of 13 and for sensitive data. Here, opt-in permission is required.\n\nOther notable provisions include:\n\nThe NHPA will require businesses to recognize universal opt-out mechanisms, such as the Global Privacy Control.\n\nThe act has a 60-day cure period for violations that sunsets one year after the law is enacted (in January 2026).\n\nNew Jersey Data Privacy Act (NJDPA)\n\nThe New Jersey Data Protection Act (NJDPA) is a data privacy law that gives New Jersey residents control over their personal data, providing certain rights and imposing obligations on those who control and process consumer data. The law applies to businesses and entities who conduct business in the state or who produce products or services targeted to those who live in New Jersey.\n\nIn terms of applicability and exemptions, New Jersey’s privacy law aligns with other state laws. It applies to controllers who, during a calendar year, meet one of the following criteria:\n\nControl or process the personal data of at least 100,000 consumers, excluding personal data processed solely for the purpose of completing a payment transaction, or\n\nControl or process the personal data of at least 25,000 consumers and the controller derives revenue or receives a discount on the price of any goods or services, from the sale of personal data.\n\nThere are a few key definitions in the law: the NJDPA defines “sale” as “sharing, disclosing, or transferring” data for money or other valuable consideration, similar to California’s law. A “controller” is an individual or legal entity that determines the purpose and means of processing personal data.\n\nSimilar to Colorado’s privacy law, it doesn’t define a specific percentage of revenue that must be derived from the sale of data, whereas other states have implemented a 25 or 50 percent threshold.\n\nThe law goes into effect in January 15, 2025, one year after its enactment.\n\nKentucky Consumer Data Protection Act (KCDPA)\n\nThe Kentucky Consumer Data Protection Ac (KCDPA) provides data privacy protections for consumers of the Bluegrass State, granting them certain, now standard rights. We’ll dive into more on that later.\n\nThe law defines consumers as residents of the state acting only as an individual, not in commercial or employment contexts. It closely aligns with Virginia’s law, which is good news for businesses already complying with the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA). And, because the VCDPA is considered a framework or foundation legislation, the KCDPA also tracks closely with other state laws that used Virginia’s law as a framework, including Tennessee and Indiana.\n\nBusinesses will become subject to the law as of January 1, 2026.\n\nSimilar to Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Indiana, Kentucky’s privacy act allows companies to collect and process most types of personal information without obtaining affirmative user consent first (in most cases). This is known as the opt-out model, which most U.S. data privacy laws follow.\n\nJust like Virginia’s law, the KCDPA applies to any person who conducts business in Kentucky or who produces products or services that target residents of the state, and during a calendar year controls or processes data of at least:\n\n100,000 consumers; or\n\n25,000 consumers and derives over 50 percent of gross revenue from the sale of personal data.\n\nLike all data privacy laws that came before it, the KCDPA applies to both controllers, or entities who determine the purpose and means of processing data, and processors, or entities that process personal data on behalf of a controller, such as a third-party vendor charged with analyzing data. The delineation between controllers and processors exists to clearly assign responsibilities for data governance between the parties involved in collecting and processing consumer data.\n\nMinnesota Consumer Data Privacy Act (MCDPA)\n\nThe MCDPA is a state-level legislation designed to safeguard the personal data of Minnesota residents. Rather than permit organizations to collect, process, and generally do whatever they wish with consumers’ personal information, data privacy regulations like the MCDPA:\n\nSet limits on what organizations can do with personal data\n\nRequire organizations to meet certain obligations, like setting safeguards, assessing for risk, and respecting consumer rights\n\nProvide consumers with data privacy rights that enable them to maintain control over their personal information\n\nOfficially enacted on May 24, 2024, the MCDPA will take effect on July 31, 2025. Once that happens, businesses will need to comply or potentially suffer penalties and fines from the state Attorney General.\n\nThe MCDPA applies to organizations that provide products or services targeted at Minnesotans and meet one of the following criteria:\n\nDuring a calendar year, they control or process the personal data of 100,000 consumers or more.\n\nThey derive more than 25 percent of gross revenue from the sale of personal data and process or control personal data of 25,000 consumers or more.\n\nAs is the case with most data privacy laws, the definition of “sale” includes both selling data for money and “other valuable considerations.”\n\nMaryland Online Data Privacy Act (MODPA)\n\nThe MODPA gives Maryland residents more control over how companies collect and use their personal data online. With an effective date of October 1, 2025, the new law establishes data protection rights and requires companies that track or target the state’s residents to meet stricter requirements around data collection—especially related to data minimization, consent, universal opt-out mechanisms, sensitive data, and children’s data. However, MODPA will not apply to companies’ data processing activities until April 1st, 2026.\n\nWhile it is an opt-out law (meaning consumers have the right to opt-out of processing data for certain purposes) Maryland’s privacy act is already known in the data privacy world as more stringent than many other state laws.\n\nMaryland’s privacy law applies to anyone who conducts business in the state, as well as those who provide services or products targeted to residents of Maryland and during the prior calendar year either:\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of at least 35,000 consumers, with the exception of personal data collected or processed solely for completing a payment transaction, or:\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of at least 10,000 consumers and derived more than 20 percent of its gross revenue from the sale of personal data.\n\nWith controller requirements and restrictions, the MODPA gets tricky. It differs from other state laws in a few key areas.\n\nIn Maryland, controllers are restricted from the collection, processing, and sharing of sensitive data, except where it’s strictly necessary to provide or maintain a specific product or service requested by the consumer.\n\nWhat’s more, controllers are banned altogether from selling sensitive data.\n\nThe Maryland Office of the Attorney General's Consumer Protection Division enforces the MCPA, which has fines of up to $10,000 per violation or $25,000 for each repetition of the same violation.\n\nThe Rhode Island Data Transparency and Privacy Protection Act (RIDTPPA)\n\nEnacted June 29, 2024, the RIDTPPA resembles many other US data privacy laws, including its requirements surrounding consent, sensitive personal information processing, and consumer rights. The law, however, does feature several important differences.\n\nNotably, the law also lacks a cure period. If you’re found to have violated the law, you’ll simply be fined without any grace period to fix the violation. Most state data privacy laws feature cure periods, though some expire at various dates in the future, and some are permanent features.\n\nThe law also does not require businesses to honor universal opt-out mechanisms.\n\nIf your organization is a for-profit entity and conducts business in Rhode Island or provides products or services targeted to Rhode Islanders, you may be subject to the RIDTPPA.\n\nSpecifically, you must meet the above criteria as well as one of the following:\n\nYour organization controlled or processed at least 35,000 state residents’ personal data.\n\nYour organization controlled or processed at least 10,000 state residents’ personal data and derived more than 20% of its gross revenue from the sale of that data.\n\nThere are exemptions, of course, but if you meet the above criteria, you likely will need to comply with the law.\n\nNew York SHIELD Act\n\nIn July 2019, New York passed the Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security (SHIELD) Act. This law amends New York's existing data breach notification law and creates more data security requirements for companies that collect information on New York residents. As of March 2020, the law is fully enforceable.\n\nThis law broadened the scope of consumer privacy and provides better protection for New York residents from data breaches of their personal information. It requires employers in possession of the New York residents’ private information to “develop, implement, and maintain reasonable safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the private information.”\n\nLast year, in 2022, the state Attorney General settled with an organization $600,000 for failing to meet minimum standards that led to a breach in security and a leak of personal information. While there have been no recent updates to the law, it is still very active and enforced, as shown by this settlement.\n\nCheck out our U.S. data privacy laws guide for a detailed summary.\n\nEuropean Data Privacy Laws\n\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation remains the law of the land, but new data privacy-related laws have been passed in the EU recently—notably, the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. Here's a refresher on the GDPR and a list of the other laws you should track to keep your organization up-to-date on data privacy in 2024.\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n\nThe most crucial data protection legislation enacted to date is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It governs the collection, use, transmission, and security of data collected from residents of any of the 28 member countries of the European Union. The law applies to all EU residents, regardless of the entity's location that collects the personal data. Fines of up to € 20 million or 4% of total global turnover may be imposed on organizations that fail to comply with the GDPR. Some essential requirements of the GDPR include:\n\nConsent\n\nData subjects must be allowed to give explicit, unambiguous consent before the collection of personal data. Personal data includes information collected through the use of cookies. Some information not usually considered \"personal information\" in the United States, such as the user's computer IP address, is considered to be \"personal data\" according to the GDPR.\n\nData Breach Notification\n\nOrganizations must notify supervisory authorities and data subjects within 72 hours if a data breach affects users' personal information in most cases.\n\nData Subjects' Rights\n\nData subjects (people whose data is collected and processed) have certain rights regarding their personal information. These rights should be communicated to data subjects in a clear, easy-to-access privacy policy on the organization's website.\n\nThe right to be informed. Data subjects must be informed about the collection and use of their personal data when the data is obtained.\n\nThe right to access their data. A data subject can request a copy of their personal data via a data subject request. Data controllers must explain the means of collection, what's being processed, and with whom it is shared.\n\nThe right of rectification. If a data subject's data is inaccurate or incomplete, they have the right to ask you to rectify it.\n\nThe right of erasure. Data subjects have the right to request the erasure of personal data related to them on certain grounds within 30 days.\n\nThe right to restrict processing. Data subjects have the right to request the restriction or suppression of their personal data (though you can still store it).\n\nThe right to data portability. Data subjects can have their data transferred from one electronic system to another at any time safely and securely without disrupting its usability.\n\nThe right to object. Data subjects can object to how their information is used for marketing, sales, or non-service-related purposes. The right to object does not apply where legal or official authority is carried out, a task is carried out for public interest, or when the organization needs to process data to provide you with a service for which you signed up.\n\nDigital Services Act (DSA)\n\nThe new regulation addresses illegal and harmful content by compelling platforms such as Google and Facebook to remove content that doesn’t meet certain standards. The primary principle is “what is illegal offline must be illegal online,” according to the Council of the EU. The Digital Services Act (DSA) entered into force on November 16, 2022. Different provisions of the law will become effective at different times, with the law coming fully into force on February 17, 2024.\n\nIt applies to four categories of businesses:\n\nIntermediary services offering network infrastructure, such as ISPs\n\nHosting services, such as cloud and web-hosting services\n\nOnline platforms that bring sellers and consumers together, such as online marketplaces, social platforms, and app stores\n\nVery large online platforms, which are defined as online platforms that reach more than 10% of the 450 million consumers in Europe\n\nEach category faces different requirements.\n\nAll of the above categories must:\n\nEngage in transparency reporting on court orders and actions taken, content moderation efforts, and more\n\nUpdate terms of service to account for fundamental rights\n\nCooperate with national authorities\n\nEstablish points of contact for authorities and, when necessary, legal representatives\n\nHosting services, online platforms, and very large online platforms must:\n\nProvide a notice-and-action mechanism enabling users to note potential illegal content for the business to remove\n\nReport criminal offenses\n\nOnline platforms and very large platforms must:\n\nImplement a complaint and redress mechanism\n\nIdentify trusted flaggers whose expertise adds special weight to their content notices\n\nTake measures against abusive notices and counter-notices\n\nIf they have a marketplace feature, take special actions, such as vetting third-party suppliers’ credentials, adhering to compliance-by-design principles, and more\n\nNot target advertisements to children or target advertisements based on users’ special characteristics\n\nProvide transparency into content recommendation systems\n\nProvide user-facing transparency into online advertising practices\n\nVery large platforms must:\n\nAdopt risk management practices and establish crisis response protocols\n\nAcquiesce to external, independent auditing, establish an internal compliance function, and be publicly accountable\n\nProvide users the choice to not be subject to content recommendations based on profiling\n\nShare data with authorities and researchers\n\nAdhere to self-drafted codes of conduct\n\nCooperate with authorities during crisis response situations\n\nEU data protection authorities may access, obtain information from, and inspect service providers to inform orders and sanctions. If a business is found to be in violation, it may be fined up to 6% of annual global turnover during the preceding financial year. If an information obligation under the DSA is violated, the maximum penalty is limited to 1% of the previous year’s income or global turnover.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act (DMA)\n\nComing into effect March 2024, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) covers the largest digital platforms, known as “gatekeepers,” which include companies like Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, and Google. The DMA aims to level the playing field for digital companies and prevent gatekeeper companies from imposing unfair conditions on their competitors. For example, a company like Amazon isn’t allowed to rank products on its site in a way that gives Amazon’s own products and services an advantage.\n\nA company is considered a gatekeeper if it:\n\nHas a strong economic position, significant impact on the EU market, and is active in multiple EU member states\n\nHas a strong position as an intermediary linking a large user base to a large number of businesses\n\nHas or will soon have an entrenched position in the market, which is determined by whether or not the company met the two previous criteria in the last three financial years\n\nUnder the DMA, businesses that qualify as gatekeepers must:\n\nNot engage in self-preferencing, where the gatekeeper promotes their own products and services over an equivalent third-party product or service on the gatekeeper’s platform\n\nNot reuse users’ data outside of the context in which it was originally collected without consent\n\nNot track users outside of the gatekeepers’ platform for the purpose of targeted advertising without consent\n\nPermit communication and content access between businesses and end users\n\nEnsure price and fee transparency in advertising intermediation services\n\nProvide access to marketing or advertising performance data on the platform to users\n\nMake it easy for users to change their default settings and uninstall software\n\nEnsure third-party technology can interoperate with the gatekeeper’s own\n\nEnsure end users’ data is portable to other systems\n\nProvide businesses with real-time access to their data on the gatekeeper’s platform\n\nNot prevent users from making complaints to authorities\n\nNot require user registration to additional services as a condition of accessing a given service\n\nNot use businesses’ non-public data to compete against them\n\nAnd more\n\nGatekeepers that violate the DMA may be subject to fines of up to 10% of annual global turnover or up to 20% in the case of repeated violations. What’s more, repeated violations may result in non-financial remedies, such as forced divestitures.\n\nThe EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework\n\nAlthough it isn't a law per se, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework is an important factor to be aware of.\n\nPreviously, businesses transferring EU citizens’ data into the U.S. relied on a framework called the Privacy Shield to ensure the data was sufficiently protected, but that framework was deemed invalid during the Schrems II court case. This forced businesses to rely on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission to provide legal protection for data transfers.\n\nHowever, these clauses are somewhat shaky, which is why there was pressure to get a replacement for the Privacy Shield stood up.\n\nOn July 10, 2023, the new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework went into effect. It includes additional security measures, a redress mechanism for EU and U.S. citizens who feel their rights have been violated, and greater protections for foreign citizens’ data that has been transferred to the U.S. Additionally, the framework requires intelligence agencies to make updates to surveillance-related policies and procedures, followed by a review by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.\n\nWhile the framework improves upon the Privacy Shield, it's not without its flaws. There will likely be criticisms from European privacy advocacy groups, but if the framework survives, it could be the method businesses use to transfer data between the EU and U.S.\n\nThe EU AI Act\n\nThe EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act was approved on 16 June 2023 and is expected to go into effect sometime in late 2025 or early 2026. It applies to any company doing business in the EU that develops or adopts “high-risk” AI systems. These systems affect employment, credit, health care, and other critical domains.\n\nThe EU AI Act applies extraterritorially, meaning the law will cover companies based elsewhere if they have customers or users inside the EU, effectively making it a global regulation.\n\nUnder the Act, businesses with applicable AI systems have to:\n\nConduct impact assessments, keep records, and meet transparency obligations\n\nNot develop systems that can be used to manipulate a person’s behavior in a manner that could cause mental or physical harm.\n\nNot develop systems that can be used to exploit the vulnerabilities of a specific group due to their age, physical or mental disabilities, or behavior in a manner that could cause psychological or physical harm.\n\nNot develop systems that could exploit vulnerable groups based on age, or physical or mental disability.\n\nNot develop systems that provide real-time remote biometric data in publicly accessible spaces by law enforcement.\n\nOther International Data Privacy Laws\n\nWith over 130 data privacy laws across the globe, it isn’t feasible to list and describe each and every one in this blog post. However, here are some important regulations that may apply to your business.\n\nBrazil’s General Law for the Protection of Personal Data, or the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD): This law came into effect in 2020 and contains many similar provisions to the GDPR. Learn more about the law in our dedicated blog article, The definitive guide to Brazil's privacy law, the LGPD.\n\nCanada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA): PIPEDA was assented to in 2000, came into full force in 2004, and was considered a progressive law at the time. It was last updated in 2015 by the Data Privacy Act but still falls short of the GDPR’s regulatory standard.\n\nChina’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL): PIPL was enacted into law in November of 2021 and broadly maps to the GDPR’s stipulations. However, it does vary in some of its details, notably by giving individuals fewer rights, requiring a stricter standard for consent, and imposing harsher penalties.\n\nIndia's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA): Significantly, this law covers all of India's 1.4 billion people. While the law broadly mirrors the GDPR, it includes some variation, notably in the form of government exemptions.\n\nReduce Complexity and Risk With a Compliance Platform",

      "# [What Is Data Privacy Compliance and How Can You Achieve It? by Matt Davis, CIPM (IAPP) on 2024-01-10](https://www.osano.com/articles/data-privacy-compliance)\nRunning a business is complex, and there is no end to the number of different domains that you’ll need to be familiar with if you want to be successful. Data privacy professionals might not need to ask what data privacy compliance is, but we can’t all be privacy pros, can we? To that end, let’s start with the basics: What is data privacy compliance, and why is data privacy important?\n\nWhat Is Data Privacy Compliance?\n\nData privacy compliance refers to the practices, policies, and procedures an organization implements to ensure they adhere to all legal regulations and standards concerning their users’ private information. These regulations balance a company’s need for collecting user data and an individual’s right to control their personal information.\n\nBut data privacy compliance also goes beyond simply complying with legal requirements. By pursuing compliance, a business also fosters a culture of responsibility toward users’ trust while ensuring the ethical use of their personal data. By doing so, businesses can create positive consumer experiences while fulfilling their obligation to secure valuable information, contributing to long-term organizational success in an ever-evolving digital landscape.\n\nBenefits of Data Privacy Compliance: Why Should You Care?\n\nAs we’ll discover, data privacy compliance can be a lot of work. Is that work worth it? The answer is, unequivocally, “yes.”\n\nFor most organizations, the first reason to become compliant is probably to avoid fines and penalties. Noncompliance penalties vary from law to law, but it’s not uncommon to see fines in the seven- or eight-figure range. In the following sections of this article, we’ll talk about some of the fine structures of the largest data privacy regulations.\n\nBut there are more benefits to data privacy compliance than merely avoiding the unlikely but potentially crippling consequences of being fined. For one, compliance with these regulations helps protect customer privacy—in other words, it’s simply the right thing to do, which consumers recognize and appreciate. Data privacy compliance can foster trusting relationships, encourage customers to return to your business, and frame your organization as a reliable institution.\n\nOn the other hand, failure to prioritize data privacy can also create a loss in consumer trust, harming your business and derailing long-term success.\n\nLastly, becoming compliant with data privacy regulation forces you to engage in stronger data governance. It’s quite possible that your operations become more efficient as a result of becoming compliant. You’ll have to implement stricter protocols around the data lifecycle at your organization; stronger security controls; and more proactive, forward-thinking policies when it comes to collecting, processing, and storing personal data. The operational efficiency that results can be a powerful advantage over competitors who need to drop everything anytime they need to answer a question about the data they handle.\n\nData Privacy Law: Major Regulations and Common Requirements\n\nDifferent jurisdictions often have unique data privacy regulations and laws, making it crucial to adhere to rules specific to your jurisdiction. While each law has its own requirements, data privacy compliance typically consists of certain common practices, such as the following:\n\nCybersecurity measures that prevent unauthorized access.\n\nTransparent communication about how user information is collected, stored, and used.\n\nProviding users with options regarding which parties receive their personal data.\n\nRespecting users’ choice to opt out of data collection. In some jurisdictions, your organization may not be permitted to collect any personal information unless the user opts in first.\n\nRespecting individuals’ rights and acting on specific requests relating to their personal data processing.\n\nEnsuring third parties with whom you share consumer data meet certain security and privacy standards.\n\nTransparent and timely communication regarding data breaches.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn this article, we’ll discuss how these and other requirements are treated in two major data privacy compliance laws: the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA; sometimes referred to by its related law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA). Both laws govern how organizations and individuals can process, collect, and store personal information and provide consumers with advanced control over the personal information organizations collect.\n\nUnderstanding these data privacy compliance laws is crucial to avoid hefty fines and consequences while protecting your customers’ trust in your organization. By adhering to transparent data practices and implementing robust security measures, businesses can comply with these regulations and enhance their reputation.",

      "# [U.S. Data Privacy Laws: A Guide to the 2024 Landscape](https://www.osano.com/us-data-privacy-laws)\nEffective Comprehensive Laws\n\nCalifornia (CCPA/CPRA)\n\nEffective Date\n\nCPRA effective date: 1/1/2023\n\nCCPA effective date: 1/1/2020\n\nEnforcement date: 7/1/2023\n\n(updated: on February 9, 2024, the CPPA won its appeal, immediately allowing enforcement of the initial CPRA regulations and retroactively setting the enforcement effective date to July 1, 2023.)\n\nSummary\n\nThe California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) is currently the most comprehensive data privacy law in the United States. It amended California's previous comprehensive state privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act.\n\nThe primary components of this law are as follows:\n\nFeature\n\nCPRA's Guidelines\n\nThresholds\n\nBuys, sells, or shares the personal information of 100,000 people or households. The “shares” part was added with the CPRA, and the number of people was doubled.\n\nCreates 50% or more of your revenue through the sale or sharing of personal information.\n\nHad $25 million in gross revenue in the preceding calendar year. The “preceding calendar year” part was added with the CPRA to make it clear what they meant by $25 million in annual gross revenues.\n\nFines\n\n$2,500 per offense for negligent mistakes.\n\n$7,500 per offense for willful offenses.\n\nCure Period\n\nNone\n\nPrivacy Impact Assessments\n\nRequired for profiling, sensitive data, large-scale processing, and other processing activities with risk of harm to consumers.\n\nRecognize Universal Opt-Out Mechanisms\n\nYes\n\nSensitive Data\n\nRacial or ethnic origin\n\nReligious beliefs\n\nMental/physical health condition treatment\n\nSexual orientation\n\nSex life\n\nCitizenship/immigration status\n\nGenetic or biometric data for purposes of uniquely identifying an individual\n\nGenetic or biometric data\n\nPrecise geolocation\n\nUnion membership\n\nNeural data\n\nConsumer Rights\n\nRight to Know/Confirm\n\nRight to Access\n\nRight to Correct\n\nRight to Delete\n\nRight to Opt Out of Certain Processing (Sensitive Data)\n\nRight to Portability/Transfer\n\nRight to Opt Out of Sales\n\nRight to Limit Sensitive Data Processing\n\nRight to Object to Automated Decision-Making/Profiling\n\nResources\n\nGuide to California privacy law (CCPA/CPRA)\n\nCPRA Compliance Checklist\n\nCPRA Survival Kit\n\nColorado (CPA)\n\nEffective Date\n\nCPA effective date: 7/1/2023\n\nSummary\n\nColorado was the third state to pass a comprehensive data privacy law, the Colorado Privacy Act (CPA). It's most similar to the CPRA, Virginia's Consumer Data Protection Act, and the GDPR.\n\nHere are the primary features you need to know about:\n\nResources\n\nGuide to the Colorado Privacy Act (CPA)\n\nConnecticut (CTDPA)\n\nEffective Date\n\nCTDPA effective date: 7/1/2023\n\nSummary\n\nConnecticut was the fifth state to adopt a privacy law. Known as the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA), or “An Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring,” Connecticut Bill 6 went into effect on July 1, 2023.\n\nResources\n\nGuide to the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA)\n\nVirginia (VCDPA)\n\nEffective Date\n\nVCDPA effective date: 1/1/2023\n\nSummary\n\nVirginia's leaders passed The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA) on March 2, 2021, making it the second state to vote in a comprehensive privacy law after California. As a result, it's similar to the CCPA and the GDPR.\n\nResources\n\nGuide to the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA)\n\nUtah (UCPA)\n\nEffective Date\n\nUCPA effective date: 12/31/2023\n\nSummary\n\nUtah became the fourth state to enact a data privacy law in March of 2022. The Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA) is considered by experts to be more business-friendly than several other privacy regulations in the U.S., including the CPRA, VCDPA, and CPA.\n\nResources\n\nGuide to the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA)\n\nTexas (TDPSA)\n\nEffective Date\n\nTDPSA effective date: 7/1/2024\n\nSummary\n\nThe Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA) was signed into law on June 18, 2023, making it the largest state in the United States — and the second of the U.S.'s largest states — to have a comprehensive privacy law on the books. The TDPSA has a few unique aspects, such as the fact that it replaces revenue-based thresholds with a focus on businesses conducting operations in Texas and offering products or services consumed by Texas residents, or businesses that process or sell personal data. It also has a novel small business provision, and while it excludes entities like state agencies and financial institutions, the law does not provide an exemption for organizations governed by HIPAA or GLBA.\n\nResources\n\nGuide to the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA)\n\nOregon (OCPA)\n\nEffective Date\n\nOCPA effective date: 7/1/2024\n\nSummary\n\nOregon's legislation passed the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (OCPA) into law on June 22, 2023. The privacy law is the culmination of four years of work by the Oregon Attorney General’s Consumer Privacy Task Force. Other than what's in the chart below, one notable feature is that non-profits aren't exempt from the law, but they have until July 1, 2025, to comply. And, like Texas, organizations governed by HIPAA or GLBA are not exempt and must follow OCPA for non-covered data.\n\nResources\n\nGuide to the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (OCPA)\n\nMontana (MTCDPA)\n\nEffective Date\n\nMTCDPA effective date: 10/1/2024\n\nSummary\n\nMontana's governor signed the Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act (MTCDPA) into law on May 19, 2023. The act is similar to data privacy laws in Indiana, Virginia, Colorado, and Connecticut. One unique factor in the MTCDPA is that Montana's thresholds don't only rely on a revenue limit. Find out more in the breakdown below.\n\nResources\n\nGuide to the Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act (MTCDPA)\n\nPending Comprehensive Laws\n\nDisplayed chronologically based on the laws' effective dates.\n\nDelaware (DPDPA)\n\nEffective Date\n\nDPDPA effective date: 1/1/2025\n\nSummary\n\nAfter the Delaware Personal Data Privacy Act (DPDPA) was voted in, people quickly started lauding it as the strongest data privacy law in the United States. That's not true — California still holds the title — however, it does apply to more businesses than others, and it is one of the more consumer-friendly laws.\n\nResources\n\nGuide to the Delaware Personal Data Privacy Act (DPDPA)\n\nIowa (ICDPA)\n\nEffective Date\n\nICDPA effective date: 1/1/2025\n\nSummary\n\nThe Iowa Consumer Data Protection Act (ICDPA) was the first comprehensive state privacy law ratified in 2023, making it the sixth overall state privacy law so far. There are a couple of differences in the Iowa law versus the others, such as the lack of provisions for the right to correct PI and the right to opt out of profiling, that it sets a 90-day timeline for responses to subject rights requests, and that it provides businesses with a 90-day cure period as opposed to the 30- or 60-day cure period set by other laws.\n\nResources\n\nGuide to the Iowa Consumer Data Protection Act (ICDPA)\n\nNebraska (NDPA)\n\nEffective Date\n\nNDPA effective date: 1/1/2025\n\nSummary\n\nThe NDPA is a comprehensive data privacy act designed to protect consumers and give them control over their personal information. It grants them certain rights, outlined below, and provides controllers, or the entity that determines the purpose and means of processing personal data, with specific requirements for how to handle data and consumer requests related to their data.\n\nThe law’s scope tracks closely with the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA), including its applicability, sensitive data, and its requirement to honor universal opt-out mechanisms.\n\nNew Hampshire (NHPA)\n\nEffective Date\n\nNJDPA effective date: 1/1/2025\n\nSummary\n\nThe New Hampshire Privacy Act (NHPA) is one of a number of statewide data privacy laws aimed at giving consumers control over their personal data in an increasingly digital world.\n\nThe good news for businesses is that the NHPA largely resembles other data privacy laws that have come before it.\n\nThe New Hampshire data privacy act’s scope is somewhat unique in that it doesn’t include a revenue threshold. Additionally, the applicability threshold is lower than other laws, but lawmakers have pointed out that this is because of the state’s lower population.\n\nLike other U.S. laws, the NHPA follows primarily an opt-out model, meaning businesses are free to process consumer data, but must notify consumers about the processing first and give them a way to opt out of the collection or sale of data.\n\nNew Jersey (NJDPA)\n\nEffective Date\n\nNJDPA effective date: 1/15/2025\n\nSummary\n\nThe New Jersey Data Protection Act (NJDPA) is a data privacy law that gives New Jersey residents control over their personal data, providing certain rights and imposing obligations on those who control and process consumer data. The law applies to businesses and entities who conduct business in the state or who produce products or services targeted to those who live in New Jersey and meet certain thresholds. Unlike other state laws, no monetary penalties are defined in the law’s text, but a violation of the NJDPA will constitute a violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, which can entail fines of up to $10,000 for the initial violation and up to $20,000 for subsequent violations.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Tennessee Information Protection Act (TIPA) was one of three comprehensive state privacy laws signed or ratified in May of 2023. TIPA follows many of its predecessors when it comes to consumer rights, enforcement, and penalties. Unlike its predecessors, however, TIPA diverges by providing a narrower applicability threshold, giving businesses a generous two years to prepare, and implementing an affirmative defense option for those with written privacy programs aligned with specific frameworks such as NIST.\n\nResources\n\nGuide to the Tennessee Information Protection Act (TIPA)\n\nMinnesota (MCDPA)\n\nEffective Date\n\nMCDPA effective date: 7/31/2025\n\nSummary\n\nThe MCDPA is a state-level legislation designed to safeguard the personal data of Minnesota residents. Rather than permit organizations to collect, process, and generally do whatever they wish with consumers’ personal information, data privacy regulations like the MCDPA set limits on what organizations can do with personal data; require organizations to meet certain obligations, like setting safeguards, assessing for risk, and respecting consumer rights; and provide consumers with data privacy rights that enable them to maintain control over their personal information\n\nResources\n\nEverything You Need to Know About the Minnesota Consumer Data Privacy Act (MCDPA)\n\nMaryland (MODPA)\n\nEffective Date\n\nMODPA effective date: 10/1/2025\n\nSummary\n\nThe MODPA gives Maryland residents more control over how companies collect and use their personal data online. With an effective date of October 1, 2025, the new law establishes data protection rights and requires companies that track or target the state’s residents to meet stricter requirements around data collection—especially related to data minimization, consent, universal opt-out mechanisms, sensitive data, and children’s data. However, MODPA will not apply to companies’ data processing activities until April 1st, 2026.\n\nResources\n\nGuide to the Maryland Online Data Privacy Act (MODPA)\n\nIndiana (INCDPA)\n\nEffective Date\n\nINCDPA effective date: 1/1/2026\n\nSummary\n\nAnother of the three state privacy laws to be voted in during May 2023 — and the second to do so in 2023 overall — the Indiana Consumer Data Protection Act (INCDPA) is similar to several of its predecessors, including the laws in Colorado (CPA), Connecticut (CTDPA), and Virginia (VCDPA). Indiana's law, however, does not solely rely on revenue as a threshold — it states that controllers must be compliant with the law even if their annual gross revenues do not meet a specific number as long as the data of a specific number of consumers (outlined in the chart below) is processed.\n\nResources\n\nGuide to the Indiana Consumer Data Protection Act (INCDPA)\n\nKentucky (KCDPA)\n\nEffective Date\n\nKCDPA effective date: 1/1/2026\n\nSummary\n\nThe KCDPA provides data privacy protections for consumers of the Bluegrass State, granting them certain, now standard rights.\n\nThe law defines consumers as residents of the state acting only as an individual, not in commercial or employment contexts. It closely aligns with Virginia’s law, which is good news for businesses already complying with the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA). And, because the VCDPA is considered a framework or foundation legislation, the KCDPA also tracks closely with other state laws that used Virginia’s law as a framework, including Tennessee and Indiana.\n\nBusinesses will become subject to the law as of January 1, 2026.\n\nFeature\n\nKCDPA's Guidelines\n\nThresholds\n\nThe KCDPA applies to any person who conducts business in Kentucky or who produces products or services that target residents of the state, and during a calendar year controls or processes data of at least:\n\n100,000 consumers; or\n\n25,000 consumers and derives over 50 percent of gross revenue from the sale of personal data.\n\nFines\n\n$7,500 per violation\n\nCure Period\n\n30 days\n\nPrivacy Impact Assessments\n\nRequired for processing that involves:\n\nTargeted advertising.\n\nSelling of personal data.\n\nProfiling, if there is a risk of unfair or deceptive treatment, potential injury to consumers, or an intrusion on their solitude or seclusion.\n\nSensitive data.\n\nPersonal data that presents a heightened risk of harm to consumers.\n\nThis requirement becomes active June 1, 2026.\n\nRecognize Universal Opt-Out Mechanisms\n\nNo\n\nSensitive Data\n\nThe law defines sensitive data as a category of personal data that includes racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health diagnosis, sexual orientation, or citizenship or immigration status; genetic or biometric data processed for identifying a specific natural person; personal data collected from a known child; or precise geolocation data.\n\nConsumer Rights\n\nRight to Know/Confirm\n\nRight to Access\n\nRight to Correct\n\nRight to Delete\n\nRight to Opt Out of Certain Processing (Profiling/Targeted Advertising)\n\nRight to opt out of sale\n\nRight to Portability/Transfer\n\nRight to Opt in for Sensitive Data Processing\n\nRight to Object to Automated Decision-Making/Profiling\n\nResources\n\nKentucky Consumer Data Protection Act (KCDPA)\n\nRhode Island (RIDTPPA)\n\nEffective Date\n\nRIDTPPA effective date: 1/1/2026\n\nSummary\n\nEnacted June 29, 2024, RIDTPPA resembles many other US data privacy laws, including its requirements surrounding consent, sensitive personal information processing, and consumer rights. The law, however, does feature several important differences, especially regarding its requirements around notices (more on that later).\n\nNotably, the law also lacks a cure period. If you’re found to have violated the law, you’ll simply be fined without any grace period to fix the violation. Most state data privacy laws feature cure periods, though some expire at various dates in the future, and some are permanent features.\n\nFeature\n\nRIDTPPA's Guidelines\n\nThresholds\n\nIf your organization is a for-profit entity and conducts business in Rhode Island or provides products or services targeted to Rhode Islanders, you may be subject to the RIDTPPA.\n\nSpecifically, you must meet the above criteria as well as one of the following:\n\nYour organization controlled or processed at least 35,000 state residents’ personal data.\n\nYour organization controlled or processed at least 10,000 state residents’ personal data and derived more than 20% of its gross revenue from the sale of that data.\n\nFines\n\n$10,000 penalty per violation.

      "# [The New Jersey Data Privacy Act (NJDPA): The Basics](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-new-jersey-data-privacy-act-njdpa-7571056/)\nConsumers in the Garden State now have comprehensive data privacy protections. But what does that mean for New Jerseyans?\n\nWith Gov. Phil Murphy signing Senate Bill 332 (S332/A1971), businesses and entities such as websites and online providers are required to notify consumers when they collect and disclose personal data to third parties, and they must provide customers with the ability to opt out of that collection or disclosure.\n\nIn a press release, Gov. Murphy said:\n\nIn a rapidly growing digital age, our society has become increasingly dependent on the internet to complete day-to-day tasks from shopping and working to deeply personal tasks such as managing finances and medical care. However, far too often consumer privacy is exploited without consumers knowing that their data is being shared and sold. This important legislation will help consumers reclaim control over their own personal data and allow them the choice to share information that is personal to them.\n\nA number of states—including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia—have passed similar laws, with New Jersey joining the contingent of states passing a comprehensive data privacy act to protect consumers absent a federal law. For an overview of the major characteristics of each U.S. privacy law, check out U.S. Data Privacy Laws: A Guide to the 2024 Landscape.\n\nLet’s dive into the new legislation that expands the U.S. consumer privacy protection landscape.\n\nWhat is the NJDPA?\n\nThe New Jersey Data Protection Act (NJDPA) is a data privacy law that gives New Jersey residents control over their personal data, providing certain rights and imposing obligations on those who control and process consumer data. The law applies to businesses and entities who conduct business in the state or who produce products or services targeted to those who live in New Jersey.\n\nNJDPA Applicability and Exemptions\n\nIn terms of applicability and exemptions, New Jersey’s privacy law aligns with other state laws. It applies to controllers who, during a calendar year, meet one of the following criteria:\n\nControl or process the personal data of at least 100,000 consumers, excluding personal data processed solely for the purpose of completing a payment transaction, or\n\nControl or process the personal data of at least 25,000 consumers and the controller derives revenue or receives a discount on the price of any goods or services, from the sale of personal data.\n\nThere are a few key definitions in the law: the NJDPA defines “sale” as “sharing, disclosing, or transferring” data for money or other valuable consideration, similar to California’s law. A “controller” is an individual or legal entity that determines the purpose and means of processing personal data.\n\nSimilar to Colorado’s privacy law, it doesn’t define a specific percentage of revenue that must be derived from the sale of data, whereas other states have implemented a 25 or 50 percent threshold.\n\nExemptions to New Jersey’s Data Privacy Law\n\nUnlike most other data privacy laws, the NJDPA doesn’t apply directly to processors—or those who process data on behalf of the controller—though they still have to comply with certain requirements when acting on behalf of a controller.\n\nThe NJDPA has a number of exemptions, including:\n\nData subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH).\n\nFinancial institutions subject to the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (GLBA).\n\nSecondary market institutions.\n\nInsurance institutions subject to certain laws.\n\nThe state’s Motor Vehicle Commission.\n\nPersonal information covered by the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\n\nNotably, nonprofits are not exempt from the NJDPA. Like Connecticut, Delaware, Montana and Oregon, New Jersey’s data privacy law exempts personal data use solely for completing a payment transaction.\n\nConsumer Rights Granted by New Jersey’s Data Privacy Law\n\nUnder the NJDPA, consumers are granted certain rights now considered pretty standard. These include the right to:\n\nConfirm whether a controller processes personal data and access that data.\n\nCorrect inaccuracies in their personal data.\n\nDelete personal data.\n\nObtain a copy of personal data in a portable, readily usable and transferable format.\n\nOpt out of processing of personal data for targeted advertising or profiling.\n\nThe law is an “opt-out” model except in the instance of two subcategories: sensitive data and children’s data.\n\nSensitive Data and Children’s Data\n\nLike other consumer data privacy laws, New Jersey’s data privacy law has a separate definition for and set of standards for businesses or entities that process sensitive data and data of children.\n\nThis is where the law’s model switches from opt out to opt in, as businesses must obtain opt-in consent for both data types. When processing the data of a child (i.e. someone under the age of 13), it must be processed in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Children’s data is also considered sensitive data under the law.\n\nSensitive data is defined broadly and includes a lengthy list of personal data types, including data that reveals:\n\nRacial or ethnic origin.\n\nReligious beliefs.\n\nMental or physical health condition, treatment, or diagnosis.\n\nSex life or sexual orientation.\n\nCitizenship or immigration status.\n\nStatus as a transgender or nonbinary person.\n\nGenetic or biometric data that may be process for identifying an individual.\n\nPersonal data collected from a known child.\n\nPrecise geolocation data.\n\nFinancial information.\n\nIt’s also important to note New Jersey’s data privacy law has an expanded definition of financial information, which includes a consumer’s account number, account log-in information, financial account, or credit or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to a consumer’s financial account. The CPRA includes a definition of financial information like this, but the NJDPA is the only law that classifies financial information as sensitive personal information requiring affirmative opt-in consent before it can be processed.\n\nThe NJDPA and Universal Opt-Out Mechanisms\n\nAs has become the trend with other data privacy laws, the NJDPA requires businesses to honor universal opt-out mechanisms. These mechanisms essentially enable users to indicate their consent preferences once via a browser plugin like the Global Privacy Control rather than every time they visit a new website. Thus, businesses must be on the lookout for such signals if they want to remain in compliance.\n\nObligations of Controllers\n\nThe New Jersey Data Privacy Act outlines a number of obligations for controllers similar to other state laws, who must limit the collection of personal data to what is “adequate, relevant and reasonably necessary;” establish, implement and maintain administrative, technical and physical data security practices; secure data; and not process sensitive data or data of a known child without consent.\n\nControllers must also post a privacy notice and a link on their website that allows consumers to opt out.\n\nData Protection Assessments Under the NJDPA\n\nThe NJDPA requires controllers to conduct a data protection assessment. Notably, New Jersey’s law requires businesses to make need to make their assessments available to the New Jersey Department of Consumer Affairs upon request, making this a key compliance task to master.\n\nActivities that present a heightened risk and would therefore require a data protection assessment are outlined as:\n\nTargeted advertising or for profiling if it presents a “reasonably foreseeable” risk of unfair or deceptive treatment of, unlawful disparate impact on consumers, financial or physical injury, physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion or the private affairs of consumers, or if it would be offensive to a reasonable person.\n\nThe sale of personal data.\n\nProcessing of sensitive data.\n\nWhat Does the NJDPA Mean for Businesses?\n\nWhenever there’s a new law, data privacy or otherwise, business owners and others who process data should review the text with their legal counsel. It’s critical to understand your data landscape—what’s collected, where it comes from, who it’s shared with and for what reason—to determine your legal requirements.\n\nIf you’re feeling overwhelmed with information overload, Osano has many resources related to all things privacy, along with solutions to help manage compliance with the growing number of state data privacy laws.\n\nNew Jersey Data Privacy Act: Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen does the NJDPA go into effect?\n\nThe law goes into effect in January 15, 2025, one year after its enactment.\n\nWho enforces the New Jersey data privacy act?\n\nLike with many other state-level data privacy laws, New Jersey’s Office of the Attorney General will enforce violations for the NJDPA.\n\nDoes New Jersey’s law provide a cure period for violations?\n\nThe NJDPA has a 30-day cure period, which is on the shorter side for state-level data laws. The cure period also expires after an 18-month grace period in which businesses are expected to adjust (i.e., July 15, 2026)\n\nWhat is the penalty for violating the NJDPA?\n\nThe New Jersey data privacy law grants rulemaking authority to the Division of Consumer Affairs within the New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety. No monetary amount is defined in the law’s text, but a violation of the NJDPA will constitute a violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, which can entail fines of up to $10,000 for the initial violation and up to $20,000 for subsequent violations.\n\nDoes New Jersey’s privacy law require businesses to honor global opt-out signals?\n\nYep, New Jersey’s will be among the states that require companies to honor universal opt-out signals. Businesses must recognize them within six months of the act’s effective date (i.e. July 15, 2025).",

      "# [“Science-policy diplomacy:” international experts tackle multilateralism and environmental governance during Climate Week on 2024-10-09](https://macmillan.yale.edu/stories/science-policy-diplomacy-international-experts-tackle-multilateralism-and-environmental)\nHow can policymakers balance global climate agreements with local conditions? How can scientists shape policy?\n\nIn a panel convened by the MacMillan Center for International & Area Studies, three experts sat down to tackle these questions on September 25 during Yale @ Climate Week NYC.\n\nDr. Maria Ivanova, Director of the Northeastern University School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs, led a conversation with Carlos Alvarado Quesada, former President of Costa Rica, and Philip Osano, Director of the Africa Centre of the Stockholm Environment Institute, in a talk titled “Flipping the Model: Leveraging Academic Perspectives to Reinvent Multilateralism.” Ivanova, M.E.M ’99, M.A. ’99, Ph.D ’06, began the panel by emphasizing the importance of mentorship across generations.\n\nIvanova writes and researches extensively on international institutions and environmental governance. She highlighted the growth of the Global Environmental Governance (GEG) Project — which she co-founded with Dan Esty JD ‘86, the Hillhouse Professor of Environmental Law and Policy, while she was a master’s student at Yale in the late 1990s.\n\n“We all stand on the shoulders of someone who’s been there before us,” Ivanova said.\n\nIvanova specifically named Philip Osano, who was one of the youth leaders selected by the GEG Project years ago and now leads mentorship programs in Kenya.\n\nOsano discussed the disconnect between different generations as there are inadequate mechanisms for younger people to be involved in decision-making. Despite the disproportionate impacts of climate change on African countries, there is a shortage of African scientists featured in major climate reports, especially young scientists, Osano said. To fill this gap, Osano supports programs that link young African scientists with older mentor figures.\n\nThe Role of Science in Policymaking\n\nMuch of the discussion focused on the role of “science-policy diplomacy,” emphasizing the role scientists can play in policymaking arenas and the possible synergies between the two disciplines to respond to the climate crisis.\n\nOsano, who has studied and worked in over a dozen countries, argued that this is a time when faith in science is declining in policymaking globally.\n\n“It’s critical that we find a way to bring science back to the center,” he said.\n\nCarlos Alvarado Quesada, who won several awards for his climate leadership while serving as President of Costa Rica from 2018-2022, acknowledged the frustration that exists over climate inaction. Alvardo posited that scientists must be able to understand the other existing issues linked to their specialty. By recognizing the other issues policymakers are considering, he argued, scientists can find a way to influence the policy sphere through \"reading” the wider room.\n\nOne major theme for the panel was what role scientists should play within institutions. Alvarado recalled that scientific arguments for expansive protection of ocean and land resources contributed to the motivation for Costa Rica to adopt the Biodiversity 30x30 goal in 2021, an initiative that was considered impossible just a few years before.\n\n“We need to shift from scaling methods to scaling impact,” Alvarado said.\n\nOsano underscored that scientists and policymakers often have to establish trust, which can be a lengthy process, and that scientists play a difficult role in sometimes having to be the person who communicates a message policymakers may not want to hear. Osano also emphasized how many impactful decisions are made in short periods of time, and then can take years to reverse.\n\nContradictions of Scale\n\nCarlos Alvarado now researches small state diplomacy in addition to teaching at the Tufts University Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy as a Professor of Practice of Diplomacy.\n\nWhile small states lack expansive resources, Alvarado emphasized their potential agility in responding to the climate crisis. Drawing on his experience governing Costa Rica, Alvarado noted how reports indicating that decarbonization would bring net benefits to the nation’s economy created synergistic evidence for climate policies despite fears of economic losses.\n\nAlvarado argued that the lack of trust and knowledge sharing across large states or blocs of power limits the ability of scientists to advance the implications of their data.\n\n“How do you measure trust?” Alvarado said. “Smaller countries are more likely to trust each other and share data. Bigger countries do not trust one another and do not share.”\n\nOsano echoed this point, noting that before cooperation can happen, nations have to believe that scientific data will not serve to their disadvantage.\n\nBuilding on her expertise in global environmental governance and the United Nations system, Ivanova reinforced the key points that our current approaches to multilateral collaboration have not been effective, and that there is a need to pivot to a fresh set of tactics that build trust, mobilize coalitions of the willing, and set aside ego.",
      "# [Winning as a Team: 15 Sales Reps Share What They Love About Their Sales Org by Conlan Carter on 2024-09-19](https://builtin.com/articles/sales-reps-share-what-they-love-about-their-sales-org)\nIs the key to building a healthy sales team a culture of belonging?\n\nSales is a competitive industry, and sales programs often provide incentives for employees to stay motivated to hit quarterly goals, cash in on commission and directly impact the company’s bottom line.\n\nBusinesses that want to foster a competitive sales environment while preventing unhealthy competitive behaviors are taking a proactive step by investing in an inclusive team culture. Celebrating individual wins as wins for the team, open and active knowledge sharing and making time for team-building activities lay the groundwork for a sales team that benefits from the healthy side of competition culture without experiencing any of the negative side effects.\n\nBy building an inclusive team culture, these teams are capitalizing on belonging in the workplace — which has a direct effect on productivity. According to a study from BetterUp, a culture of belonging in a workplace can lead to a 56 percent increase in employee performance. When employees feel they are in the right place and working with the right people, they tend to deliver their best work.\n\nBuilt In had the opportunity to speak with 15 sales reps across the country to hear what they love about their sales team — and the culture that supports their shared success.\n\nAlexander Keast\n\nSenior Account Executive • Qualtrics\n\nQualtrics creates software that helps brands deliver exceptional frontline experiences, build high-performing teams and design products people love.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Qualtrics’ sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nThe reason I’m excited to come to work today is probably the same reason I was excited to join Qualtrics in the first place: the culture of the organization. I joined from SAP, and having worked with Qualtrics before, I had a great impression of the people I would work with.\n\nQualtrics has a fantastic culture, especially in our U.K. office in London. There’s a strong sense of teamwork and collaboration towards common goals. What excites anyone about going to work is collaborating with intelligent people, serving engaged clients, solving problems for those clients and moving the business forward — all in an open manner. I get along well with everyone in this office, and that’s what it’s all about.\n\n“I get along well with everyone in this office, and that’s what it’s all about.”\n\nIn terms of how this sales team is different, it comes down to management and the culture that cascades through the management chain. My boss Andrew is extremely thoughtful and patient. There’s little hierarchy between us, allowing for collaboration and support on deals. Having a collaborative boss who adds value to how you work and helps you grow is a big difference at Qualtrics, with the recognition that things take time and you’re given that time to develop.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nWe have a good team culture. Sales professionals can sometimes prioritize individual competition over collaboration, which may lead to unintended negative behaviors. However, within our team, we genuinely help and support each other. For example, I’m currently helping two colleagues who are on holiday. We truly make an effort to assist one another, and that stems from hiring the right people who fit this culture.\n\nWe all share valuable insights from our customer conversations, and we recently had a team-building activity in Dublin, which was a lot of fun. We celebrate our successes, and it really comes from having a supportive manager who fosters a culture of collaboration.\n\nIf I were to describe this to a friend looking to apply, I’d say it’s a supportive environment with great people who you might enjoy spending time with outside of work.\n\nWhat are the perks like for sales folks?\n\nSales is a risk-reward function; the rewards can be great, but the risks are high. While I haven’t made the President’s Club at Qualtrics specifically, I’ve made it at other companies. I’d summarize Qualtrics by saying it’s a supportive culture with great people, where you can have fun while you work. Plus, there are the usual perks, like going to the President’s Club or our sales kickoff in Vegas last year which is a fun highlight.\n\nDarrin Cowie\n\nAccount Manager • DFIN\n\nDFIN offers end-to-end risk and compliance solutions through a suite of software solutions.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is DFIN’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nThere really is no one thing that makes me excited to come to work every day. It is a culmination of a couple of key items.\n\nFirst and foremost, interacting with my clients on a daily basis brings me much joy. The clients that I support are by and large happy with the DFIN partnership they have chosen and are always open to learning about how I can make their lives just a little bit easier. The job of reporting a company’s financials to the SEC is undoubtedly very stressful and often thankless, so I try to look for “operational efficiencies” that I can bring to my clients every day that will make their job a little easier during peak filing periods.\n\nThe culture and people at DFIN are also big differentiators from businesses that I have worked for in the past.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nThe sales culture at DFIN is one that is supportive of one another and inclusive and welcoming of diverse opinions and thoughts. Our team is extremely support and truly interested in each other’s successes — always willing to lend a colleague a helping hand knowing that they will better themselves by doing so.\n\n“The sales culture at DFIN is one that is supportive of one another and inclusive and welcoming of diverse opinions and thoughts.”\n\nThe DFIN sales team is also fortunate to have a large number of legacy sales professionals who have been working within the financial industry for a very long time.\n\nWhat I am most impressed with is the concerted effort that is made by the business to hire sales professionals from outside the industry with a wide range of backgrounds and experiences to draw from. The diversity that has been brought into the sales team has prompted the organization to look at things differently and challenge the status quo. Having the courage to not do something simply because “that’s the way we have always done it” has given the space for the organization to grow and thrive into the future.\n\nWhat are the perks like for sales folks?\n\nDFIN is an organization that believes in and encourages work-life balance. After the Covid-19 pandemic, we all found ourselves in a world where the line between work life and home life is often blurred — dogs barking in the background during conference calls, Amazon deliveries being delivered mid-day, your child needing to be picked up from school because of an early dismissal, etc.\n\nDFIN is proud to offer its associates an unlimited amount of paid time off in order to help better balance the personal and professional responsibilities that are required of all of us. Additionally, DFIN offers a fair and competitive compensation plan that rewards its associates for the right types of sales behaviors and significantly increases commission payouts for overachievement.\n\nFlorence Guyot\n\nArea VP – Southern Europe • Nexthink\n\nNexthink helps IT teams around the world modernize the digital employee experience.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Nexthink’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nEvery day, I wake up with a sense of anticipation and enthusiasm, eager to step into my management role with the sales team. This excitement is fueled by several key factors that make my job not just a profession but a passion.\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of working with this sales team is the collaborative and supportive environment we foster. On this sales team, there’s a strong emphasis on personal and professional development through continuous learning and growth. We also work with a clear vision and purpose. We are not just selling products; we are providing solutions that genuinely help our clients achieve their goals. This sense of purpose adds meaning to my work, knowing that what I do has a positive impact on others. We are encouraged to think outside the box, experiment with new approaches, and leverage the latest technology to improve our efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, a significant motivator for me is the recognition and reward. Hard work and dedication do not go unnoticed here. Whether it’s a simple acknowledgment in a team meeting, kudos or tangible rewards, there is an appreciation for effort here.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nWhen describing the culture of our sales team to a friend, the first thing that comes to mind is the word “inclusive.” Our team is more than just a group of colleagues — we’re a community that thrives on diversity, collaboration and shared success. The atmosphere here is incredibly collaborative. We genuinely work together to achieve our goals, rather than competing against one another. One of the things that truly sets our team apart is how much we enjoy celebrating our successes. Whether it’s hitting a major sales milestone, closing a big deal or even just making it through a tough week, we make it a point to celebrate. These celebrations range from casual after-work get-togethers to more organized events like team lunches, outings or themed office parties. It’s all about recognizing hard work and making sure everyone feels appreciated.\n\n“Our team is more than just a group of colleagues — we’re a community that thrives on diversity, collaboration and shared success.”\n\nWhat are the perks like for sales folks?\n\nThe compensation package for our sales team is highly competitive. It includes a strong base salary complemented by an attractive commission structure that rewards high performance. As growth is a key part of our team culture, we invest in professional development: training, mentorship and coaching. Depending on your role, you may have the option to work remotely, either part-time or full-time. This flexibility allows you to manage your schedule in a way that suits your lifestyle. Our sales team often benefits from flexible working hours, allowing our sales to start and finish their days at times that work best for them, as long as their goals are met.\n\nThe perks for our sales team go far beyond the typical benefits package. From competitive compensation to professional development, health and wellness support and flexible work arrangements, we strive to create an environment where our salespeople can thrive both professionally and personally. These perks are a reflection of our commitment to valuing and supporting our team members, ensuring that they are motivated, satisfied and equipped to succeed.\n\nSarah Reiff\n\nAccount Executive • Trustpilot\n\nTrustpilot is an independent review platform that helps consumers find businesses they trust.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Trustpilot’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nMy team and colleagues are what make me excited to come to work every day. While we are individual contributors, my team is always collaborating and learning from each other. Together we come up with new outreach strategies, help each other with opportunities and more. Even when we are remote, my team is in constant communication and we’re huge supporters of each other.\n\nAdditionally, working with different businesses every day keeps me engaged and on my toes. I’m able to prospect in various verticals and can focus on multiple industries each day. This is a differentiator from other sales teams I’ve worked for as my focus is broader, and I have more room to reach out to industries that pique my interest.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nThe culture of our sales team is collaborative, fun and welcoming. Everyone is always super friendly and more than happy to help each other out. I’m comfortable reaching out to any of my colleagues for anything because everyone wants to see each other succeed. We are constantly sharing best practices and updating strategies with each other.\n\nMy favorite tradition in the office is the gong and boxing bell that we ring when the deal closes which creates a great energy in the office. The energy is particularly high on closing days when we get to celebrate our wins and head out for team socials to connect and reset before the next month. Aside from closing days, there are various themed events and socials throughout the year such as summer and winter parties, in-office Olympic games, Juneteenth celebrations and more. There’s also a monthly catered community lunch where the whole office comes together, which is a great way to get to know people from other teams.\n\nWhat are your favorite memories from working on this team?\n\nMy favorite memory on the sales team was when I closed my first deal as an account executive. The entire sales floor was so exciting for me, and I received an abundance of support, virtually and in person. This memory really speaks to our culture on the sales floor, as everyone is always happy for each other. Over a year into the role, my colleagues are still extremely supportive and excited for each other. We love to win together.\n\n“We love to win together.”\n\nLiz Clarke\n\nAccount Manager • Altium\n\nAltium offers sophisticated electronics design software with a platform that encompasses the entire electronics journey from design to manufacturing.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Altium’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nI’m passionate about Altium’s suite of products and building relationships with people, both clients and colleagues. I truly care about our clients and their work, making it naturally enjoyable to serve as a trusted advisor every day. The sales team at Altium is very collaborative and reciprocal in terms of challenging and motivating each other to expand our knowledge and methodologies.\n\n“The sales team at Altium is very collaborative and reciprocal in terms of challenging and motivating each other to expand our knowledge and methodologies.”\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nThe culture is welcoming, progressive and rewarding, and everyone — including senior leadership — is very approachable. Altium also makes a point to celebrate work anniversaries and birthdays and host team outings.\n\nWhat are the perks like for sales folks?\n\nThe sales organization hosts individual and team contests with a variety of rewards including spiffs, vouchers, gift cards, work-from-home days, etc.\n\nSteven Kuan\n\nSenior Account Executive • Osano\n\nOsano is a data privacy compliance company that offers an all-in-one platform to help organizations manage their security programs.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Osano’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nOsano was my first major job after college, but even with that limited experience, I still know what makes working at Osano exciting for me. I hear from friends who feel stuck or deal with office drama. Personally, I’ve never encountered either of those feelings in my four years at Osano. I attribute this to Osano’s approach: “Get comfortable with being uncomfortable.” This philosophy — shared by my mentor, Jake Bernstein — resonates deeply with me. It’s important that my daily work is intentional, has a purpose and keeps me growing.\n\nOn Osano’s sales team, I was taught to embrace change and put it into daily practice. Growing in my career and as a person is why I’m consistently excited to come to work every day. The cherry on top is Osano recognizes and rewards this growth and impact. For instance, I started as an entry-level sales development representative, and now I’m a senior account executive. Growth is part of the culture at Osano, so long as you seek it.\n\n“Growth is part of the culture at Osano, so long as you seek it.”\n\nEven though Osano is the only sales team I’ve been part of, I believe what sets us apart is the people, our “Osanians.” We truly value people who share our goals, values and diverse perspectives.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nOur culture at Osano is all about being yourself at work. It’s about embracing who you are and trusting in your ability to do your job in the most authentic way. One of my very first mentors here at Osano — Chief Revenue Officer Dustin Joost — once saved me from a terrible case of imposter syndrome. I was recently promoted from sales development rep to account executive and I had so much to learn. I initially thought I had to be someone else to succeed in sales. Instead, my mentor shared that every salesperson has their own “superpower” which makes them unique in their own way. I took these words to heart and honed my superpower, and now I get to be myself while selling a product I truly believe in and love.\n\nIn the spirit of authenticity, we’ve had a range of special traditions and celebrations at Osano. One of my favorites was when our manager treated us to Taco Bell to celebrate a successful month or quarter. It’s often the little things that help our sales team excel at our work while also enjoying ourselves — almost like we’re living the “live mas” spirit.\n\nWhat are your favorite memories from working on this team?\n\nIn 2022 during our second annual team trip to Austin, we spent a lot of time together attending working sessions as a sales and marketing team and enjoying fun activities like horseback riding, axe throwing, team dinners and more. For me, it’s the in-between conversations where I learn more about my coworkers’ families and their lives outside of work and hobbies, getting to know them on a personal level. Being 100 percent remote, we come together for our annual team trips and pick it right up from where we left off.\n\nOn the final day, we had our company dinner with our first-ever culture awards ceremony. I was nominated and won Osano’s first-ever “2022 Most Revenue Award” on the sales team. It was impactful to win the award and see my mentors, the sales team, and other Osanians who’ve been part of my growth. I have so much pride in being part of Osano and seeing their faces and excitement. Accepting this award has been the highlight of my career so far.\n\nFast forward to today, I’ve continued taking on more responsibilities, becoming a subject matter expert on our data privacy platform, and I feel honored to be able to share my experience and learnings while pushing Osano forward.\n\nDrew LeValley\n\nCommercial AE • Exabeam\n\nExabeam offers AI-driven security operations via its platform, which helps businesses with threat detection, investigation and response processes.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Exabeam’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nI absolutely love coming to work and representing this sales team at Exabeam. In the past, I have worked on teams in person and I actually feel more of a connection working on this team from a remote location, which is pretty fascinating to me. Each person on our team comes from a different career background and experience level. I am definitely still in the earlier stages as far as that goes, but I never feel less than my other teammates. We are all working towards the same goals and have each other’s backs.\n\n“I never feel less than my other teammates. We are all working towards the same goals and have each other’s backs.”\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nThe first word that comes to mind is “family.” Our manager emphasizes this, and I can really feel that day in and day out. My manager and other team members are quick to help me out in any way possible and are kind enough to make themselves available no matter how busy their schedule is. Although we all work from different parts of the country, it doesn’t affect the tight-knit team we have formed. Whenever a deal is closed, no matter how big or small, the entire team is almost immediately sending over praise and celebratory messages.\n\nWhat are your favorite memories of working on this team?\n\nSomething special for me to look back on is that I was included as a part of this team before I was even officially on the team. I had expressed interest in becoming a commercial rep, and my now manager Brian allowed me to join their team calls to get a look at what it’s like and how they operate. The other reps were welcoming and offered to help me out in any way they could. When it came time for the opportunity to join the team, it felt like I had already been accepted as a part of it long before.\n\nGrace Singer\n\nEnterprise Account Executive • FareHarbor\n\nFareHarbor provides an all-in-one booking and business management platform designed for tours, activities, rentals and attractions.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is FareHarbor’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nI’ve worked at FareHarbor for almost eight years, and I’ve never had the “Sunday Scaries” — I genuinely look forward to working. I am motivated by healthy competition amongst my colleagues, and by the uncapped commission. I decide how many calls I make and which companies I reach out to. I love working with our clients, activity businesses, because the owners I speak with are fascinating. I always look forward to conversations with skydivers or scuba divers who are passionate enough about their hobbies to build successful businesses around them.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nMy team name is “Seabeast,” so hopefully that gives you an idea of how fun the environment is here. My coworkers are kind, charismatic and always willing to help each other out. Many sales organizations are all about competition, but with FareHarbor, there are 10 people on my team who are excited to help me strategize. We enjoy dreaming up creative pitches and brainstorming ways to align our software with funky client needs.\n\n“Many sales organizations are all about competition, but with FareHarbor, there are 10 people on my team who are excited to help me strategize.”\n\nDespite being a hybrid company with offices in many cities, I still feel connected to my team members who work farther away. There are always opportunities to join video calls and participate in cold-calling games to get more face time. And when we’re physically in the same place, my teammates are always willing to meet up for ten-too-many dumplings at our favorite local spot.\n\nWhat are the perks like for sales folks?\n\nThere are many perks that are unique to our sales team. Tangible benefits include uncapped commission, sales contests where winners are awarded monetary prizes, seasonal office parties, the option to travel for big client meetings or conferences and more.\n\nThere are also non-tangible perks that add a lot of value from a career perspective. The first is innovation and impact. We are not set in our ways. When I have an idea for a new type of company that we should target or an investment that FareHarbor should make, leadership is all ears. FareHarbor wants to grow and understands the value of fresh perspectives. FareHarbor is not meeting-heavy. Self-sufficient salespeople seeking freedom will excel here. My biggest motivation is seeing my coworkers close gigantic deals and thinking, “Which company in my lead pool will change my life?”\n\nSara Kofman\n\nAccount Executive • Drata\n\nDrata offers automated compliance services from start to audit-ready.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Drata’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nWhat excites me about coming to work each day is the ability to truly help organizations start and scale their compliance programs. This is new for a lot of people I speak with, and it can feel overwhelming for them at first. My job is to help educate them about this process, showcase ways to make this extremely manageable and valuable for their teams and turn what some may consider a daunting or boring project into something exciting.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nI would describe the culture on the Drata sales team as electric. I have never been surrounded by so many skilled, intelligent and genuinely helpful reps in my life. Everyone truly has each other’s backs, is constantly sharing information to help the broader team, is willing to lend a hand to help you win and motivates each other to do better. Sales can and should be a really competitive environment. But at Drata, it doesn’t feel like you’re competing against one another. It feels like you’re competing together — on a team.\n\n“At Drata, it doesn’t feel like you’re competing against one another. It feels like you’re competing together.”\n\nWhat are your favorite memories from working on this team?\n\nMy favorite memories are the in-person quarterly business reviews and annual kickoffs, where we all come together to celebrate a year’s worth of hard work. Seeing my peers in person, learning about their personal lives and accomplishments outside of work and celebrating each other’s performances allow me to feel connected to my peers and less alone in a very challenging role.\n\nNick Zafirson\n\nVP, Sales • Cedar\n\nCedar provides a healthcare services platform that connects providers and payers for an improved healthcare billing experience.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Cedar’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nI’m passionate about solving complex problems that make a tangible difference in people’s lives. Healthcare billing is a notoriously challenging process for millions of Americans, and as someone who has felt the pain and frustration of a poor billing experience firsthand, I feel deeply connected to Cedar’s mission.\n\nI’ve been fortunate to be a part of some amazing teams over my career, but Cedar continues to impress. Everyone on our team is extremely talented, collaborative and committed to the work we do. There are no egos to contend with, and we all recognize that growth is a team sport. With such capable and seasoned experience, I’m confident that this team will produce multiple leaders in our industry.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nCedar’s sales team is as close a group as I have ever been a part of. I consider us a family that actually gets along, and we genuinely can’t wait for opportunities to connect with each other. While I believe every successful sales team should be goal-oriented, I would describe our culture as collaborative and mission-driven. Every new partnership that we solidify gets us one step closer to our mission, and the team member who led the deal has the honor of announcing the news to the entire company. Since complex sales take a village, these announcements are an opportunity for our sales team to thank all teams and individuals who contributed to the company’s success. It’s a great tradition that leads to positive energy across the company.\n\n“I consider us a family that actually gets along, and we genuinely can’t wait for opportunities to connect with each other.”\n\nWhat are your favorite memories from working on this team?\n\nWhile there are many memories to choose from, our team offsites stand out above the rest. Healthcare is a complex industry with long and demanding sales cycles, so it’s critical to balance the hard work with unique opportunities to bond and celebrate our achievements as a team.\n\nA few years ago, we traveled to Park City, UT where we enjoyed a few amazing days of skiing, eating and, to appease those funding the trip, some light strategic planning. On the last night, we made our way to the grand piano in the hotel lobby where a musically talented individual from our team led an impromptu sing-along that lasted well into the night. It wasn’t a planned team-building activity; it was just a group of close friends enjoying each other’s company and having an incredible time. That moment will stay with me forever and is representative of the incredible culture we have built at Cedar.\n\nIf you want to be part of a team where strong bonds and meaningful work come together, consider applying to Cedar.\n\nSean McMaster\n\nStrategic Account Executive • Sendbird\n\nSendbird is a conversation platform that supports chat, voice and video features in other applications.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Sendbird’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nThe part of my job that excites me most about coming to work each day is helping our customers solve their communication challenges. One of Sendbird’s core values is “Endless Tenacity for our Customers,” and it all starts with empowering customers with the right product offerings through strategic consultative selling.\n\nThe sales team at Sendbird is different than other places I have worked for because you get the real sense that leadership cares about your well-being and success. In other places, I have felt more like a number on a large team, but at Sendbird, I feel like I can make a difference that is noticed by the entire company.\n\n“In other places, I have felt more like a number on a large team, but at Sendbird, I feel like I can make a difference that is noticed by the entire company.”\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nThe sales team’s culture at Sendbird demands effort, execution and growth to be successful. The sales team trusts and supports each other, which promotes healthy competition and personal development. The leadership team is quick to mentor and correct any mistakes that may harm the company’s overall success.\n\nThe team also celebrates wins big and small and rallies around those needing help. An example of celebrating wins is with a companywide “#winning” Slack channel solely dedicated to highlighting sales wins and providing positive encouragement and praise to all the team members involved in each deal. This channel helps to build deep relationships across all the teams at Sendbird.\n\nWhat are the perks like for sales folks? What are your favorite memories of working on this team?\n\nThere are many great perks to working at Sendbird in sales, and working remotely is probably at the top of the list for me. This provides a lot of flexibility with the work-life balance that Sendbird promotes. Other perks include an allotted amount of money every year to be your best self, which can only be used to spend on yourself or your family. We also have remote team lunches that are covered by Sendbird on a bi-weekly cadence.\n\nOne of my most incredible memories is our 2022 President’s Club. The top producers among all the teams were invited to stay at the Mayakoba Resort in Playa del Carmen. I have been to many President’s Clubs over the years, and this was by far the most fantastic resort imaginable. There were so many amazing people there from Sendbird, and it truly was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I will never forget sharing with co-workers, whom I view as close friends and family.\n\nEthan Jaffe\n\nAccount Executive, Data Sales • Crexi\n\nCrexi is a commercial real estate technology company that provides transparent information on properties for sale, lease and auction.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Crexi’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nFrom the moment I started, I’ve never had a day I wasn’t excited to go to work. I have the opportunity to talk to diverse personalities, both customers and coworkers. I am surrounded by the most accomplished, smart and driven group of teammates I’ve ever worked with, and it’s not just the sales team — it’s true of the entire company.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nMost sales organizations preach teamwork and collaboration, but Crexi lives and breathes it. Teamwork is our culture. We call clients for each other, close deals for each other and constantly update one another on the most effective strategies. The product is also great. The product team responds to and innovates based on feedback, and it’s great to sell something you believe in. The team’s dynamics and processes are fun, helpful and fair as well. Everyone has the same opportunity to succeed, the same number of leads and the same support system.\n\n“Most sales organizations preach teamwork and collaboration, but Crexi lives and breathes it.”\n\nWhat are the perks like for sales folks?\n\nWe work hard, but we also know how to celebrate our wins. Whether it’s a company-paid trip to Yard House for a birthday lunch or spinning a wheel for bonus money when we hit our numbers, Crexi makes sure our efforts are rewarded with both fun and commission.\n\nAlex Cornman\n\nEnterprise Account Manager • Lansweeper\n\nLansweeper is an IT asset management software provider helping businesses better understand, manage and protect their IT devices and network.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Lansweeper’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nWhat gets me excited to come to work each day is being surrounded by a team that shares similar goals and objectives. We celebrate each other’s wins, big and small. The genuine camaraderie and mutual support make it a rewarding environment. Plus, there’s always someone ready to offer a helping hand when needed, which fosters a strong sense of community and teamwork. It’s this supportive and goal-oriented culture that makes each day here fulfilling and energizing.\n\n“It’s this supportive and goal-oriented culture that makes each day here fulfilling and energizing.”\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nThe culture on our sales team is dynamic and collaborative. We have a supportive environment where everyone is encouraged to share ideas and work together towards common goals. Communication is open and transparent, and there’s a strong emphasis on both individual and team success.\n\nFor traditions, we often celebrate milestones and achievements with team events or social gatherings, which help build camaraderie and boost morale. We also have regular team meetings where we discuss progress, share insights and recognize outstanding contributions.\n\nWhat are your favorite memories of working on this team?\n\nSince Lansweeper is a global company, I particularly look forward to our annual sales kickoff each year. It’s an exciting opportunity for everyone in Austin to connect face-to-face with colleagues who work remotely from different locations. This event allows us to strategize collectively, share insights and align on the initiatives and goals for the year ahead. It’s not just about setting objectives; it’s about coming together as a unified team to build a cohesive strategy and foster relationships that strengthen our collaboration throughout the year. The kickoff energizes us and sets a positive tone for the months to come, making it a highlight of the year.\n\nLaura Fowler\n\nSenior Strategic Account Executive • NextRoll\n\nNextRoll is a marketing technology company that offers multiple software solutions that power B2B marketing and advertising programs.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is NextRoll’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nAt NextRoll, our sales team is very collaborative toward our goal of strategically serving our potential customers. Our collaborative approach is exemplified by the exceptional commitment of our team members.\n\nFor example, a colleague of mine who is a customer success manager took time out of her vacation to provide crucial information to help me with a head-to-head comparison with a competitor. Peers of mine have guided me with tips for using tools within our technology stack. One of our senior product managers here tackles challenging legal and product questions at critical stages, ensuring we’re able to deliver the best solutions. Our onboarding team consistently shares innovative campaign ideas to enhance late-stage opportunities. Additionally, one of our solutions consultants exemplified dedication by inputting a large amount of data into my demo instance for a big presentation I had coming up, even after working a long day.\n\nThese examples highlight how our team unites to either win or go down fighting, always striving to find the best solutions for our customers.\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nOur team embodies a healthy, lively spirit, thriving on friendly competition. An example of friendly competition occurred when my teammate and I attended an in-person industry conference and eagerly competed to secure the most scans and booked meetings. While we aimed to win, we also supported each other and ensured that contacts were routed to the appropriate sales segments within our company. Our team is collaborative by sharing creative outreach ideas, calling and meeting success stories and making the process of advancing deals both fun and innovative. Our leadership offers spiffs for self-generated opportunities, fueling our collective success.\n\nOur sales culture is collaborative and supportive, with a strong focus on sharing best practices. We enjoy flexible schedules, essential for managing global accounts effectively. We proudly celebrate and reward the discovery and prospecting of quality opportunities, fostering a motivating and dynamic work environment.\n\n“Our sales culture is collaborative and supportive, with a strong focus on sharing best practices.”\n\nWhat are your favorite memories of working on this team?\n\nOne of my most rewarding experiences was collaborating with our internal teams — solutions consultants, onboarding, customer success, and sales leadership — to secure a deal. Our lead solutions consultant and VP of sales joined me for a virtual demo during a bustling industry convention. Despite the noise and commotion going on around us, we successfully presented to a team of 20 professionals in a late-stage opportunity. Our prior collaboration with their marketing team and the compelling business case we had built were crucial in winning the deal from a well-known competitor. We even overcame that competitor’s discounting efforts to renew with the customer. This experience deepened my connection to our team and heightened my excitement for my role.\n\nCaitlin Lonergan\n\nField Market Manager, New York Metro • Oishii\n\nOishii provides high-quality fruits via its non-GMO, technology-supported indoor, vertical farms.\n\nWhat makes you excited to come to work each day? How is Oishii’s sales team different than others you have worked for in the past?\n\nThe job is different every day and it keeps me excited. I hate being stuck in a routine, so I love the variety that comes with working in field sales. One day I’m visiting our top-selling stores in New York City, and another day I’m sampling berries at a festival in DC.\n\nI have a nontraditional background for a typical sales job, so Oishii allows me to pull all of my previous experience and skills together into one dynamic and creative role. I have always enjoyed start-up culture and the sense of freedom that comes with trying new things.\n\nWhat I love about our sales team is that we are so much more focused on developing relationships and strategies than just numbers. Yes, numbers are obviously a huge part of sales, but we’re on the ground floor of building the mechanisms to achieve them. Our success is directly reflective of the quality of our work — forming deep connections with customers and store teams and providing valuable feedback about what’s going on in each of our regions to the rest of the sales team at our headquarters and throughout the United States.\n\n“What I love about our sales team is that we are so much more focused on developing relationships and strategies than just numbers.”\n\nWhat is the culture on the sales team like?\n\nThe Oishii sales team has a strong sense of camaraderie. It’s essential for us all to feel connected since we are spread across the county, so we chat daily, even if it’s just photos of the latest Oishii berry cocktail we’ve created. Usually, when a problem arises in one region, it’s bound to happen in another, so we are always sharing new insights and strategies with each other.\n\nOne of the philosophies we all believe in is “One Team, One Fight.” We’re a melting pot of individuals and different backgrounds with one common goal: revolutionizing agriculture and fruit. We work collaboratively on cross-regional projects that benefit us all. I personally have worked hard on developing our brand ambassador role, while others have executed some of Oishii’s largest events to date.\n\nA great example of team culture is during large calls, you can often hear a slack “ping” in the background while one of us is presenting their wins for the week — that’s the rest of the sales team chiming in to congratulate them! We also host quarterly dinners for each other in our respective territories. This is a great way to bond and share what makes each region unique.\n\nWhat are the perks like for sales folks?\n\nSales folks at Oishii have lots of perks and opportunities given that we are on the ground floor of a dynamic and ever-growing company. We get the usual benefits of sales positions such as a quarterly bonus and my favorite perk, leftover berries from all of the events we host.\n\nBut really, we have the opportunity to grow in our roles and into other roles. In my own territory, we went from 26 locations to 53 in just a few months. I took this opportunity to grow my team, work on people management and create organizational tools that I’ve been able to share with other rapidly growing regions. We also have the opportunity to move laterally across the company. I’ve seen part-time brand ambassadors turn into full-time managers and others find their passion at Oishii even if it’s not what they initially signed onto.",

The students were part of a larger group of eleven student researchers from six universities, who also presented at the conference as part of the research team that works with Bowie State biology professor Dr. Anne Osano. The students worked together to prepare for the opportunity to have their research examined by industry professionals.\n\n“They can explain to the community what they did and why it’s important,” said Dr. Osano. “You have students from all over the nation, and they’re competing in their research.”\n\nERN is a national conference with participation from universities across the nation. The conference is aimed at university undergraduate and graduate students who participate in programs funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The objectives of the conference are to help undergraduate and graduate students to enhance their science communication skills and to better understand how to prepare for science careers in a global workforce.\n\nDr. Osano was thrilled to have so many of her students’ abstracts accepted at this latest conference. Bowie State’s participation not only highlights the university as a quality research institution, but the process of getting research accepted also boosts the students’ professional profile once they make it through the rigorous process.\n\n“They become even more competitive when they’re looking for a job,” said Dr. Osano. “The job market knows this is a good candidate if they can do research, present it and convince someone that ‘Hey, I have something important here.’”\n\n###",

      "# [A moment in time: Castaic Middle School unearths time capsule by Katherine Quezada on 2024-05-09](https://signalscv.com/2024/05/a-moment-in-time-castaic-middle-school-unearths-time-capsule/)\nTwenty-five years ago, Castaic Middle School students filled up a box with different timely objects such as a Walkman, a cassette tape, a newspaper with the headline, “Clinton Impeached,” and various other popular objects of the time so people decades later could get a glimpse of what life was like then.\n\nOn Friday, in a special school assembly, current Castaic Middle School students and faculty got to see the many different objects that were placed in the time capsule and buried under a bench on school grounds in 1999.\n\nIt was a trip down memory lane for everyone in attendance and a special experience for eight former teachers who were a part of the school’s faculty dating back to the old school site.\n\nJeanette Edwards, a former teacher from 1996 to 2015, taught English, English as a second language, and foreign languages. She eagerly looked at the table of timely objects such as student I.D cards, a physical education T-shirt and an old textbook that she immediately recognized.\n\n“It’s nostalgic. I started out in the old Castaic Middle School. I came to the new one when it was just ground, I came to the groundbreaking and … to just come here now … it’s still exactly the same,” Edwards said as she also greeted her previous colleagues after not seeing each other for a long time.\n\n“This is a good small-knit community that has so much support,” said Castaic Union School District Superintendent Bob Brauneisen. “We have four of the five principals that have been at Castaic Middle School and rarely are you able to bring back so many people.”\n\nIn attendance was special guest Beverly Silsbee, who was the school’s principal for several decades and one of the few people who witnessed the time capsule being built. She eventually became superintendent for the school district until retiring in 2005.\n\nSilsbee shared the history of Castaic Middle School, and the trailers students took classes in at local park. Silsbee also taught swimming before becoming principal during the 1970s. The trailers used for classes began disintegrating, which pushed the teachers and local community members to advocate for a permanent fully functioning facility, she said.\n\n“Our teachers went out, we passed a bond to fund building a new middle school and eventually it happened,” she said. “Even when we were in trailers, we were a humble campus. We were a distinguished school in those days and a school to watch. It’s not always [about] the way you look.”\n\nCastaic Middle School moved to its current campus and the ASB teacher at the time thought of creating a time capsule. With a lot of hard work, patience, and community involvement, the time capsule was filled and buried.\n\nThe time capsule unearthing was meant to happen sooner, but with the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic “we had to keep putting it off,” said Silsbee. “It should have happened in 2021.”\n\nThe opportunity to reconnect with former colleagues was something Silsbee described as special. “We became a family and I think it’s because we worked so hard together. I think a lot of [the former] staff feels that way.”\n\nDuring the ceremony, the time capsule was updated, and students of the 2024 graduating class filled up a new waterproof tool box with items they believed people in 25 years would enjoy opening.\n\n“It’s exciting. It’s just fun to see them excited about something. I really think it’s an important appreciation of the history of establishing your story,” added Silsbee about the time capsule tradition being kept."
