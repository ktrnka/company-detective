Cool thing with this setup is that you set if your cookies category directly in GTM and fire them only if you have permission. Besides that, Complianz is also fully GDPR compliant and has a lot of features like consent storage built in (for cookies and for forms as well).

It's lightweight, easy to set up, and takes care of cookie consent management automatically. Plus, it's fully compliant with GDPR and other privacy regulations, which is a huge relief when you're trying to stay on the right side of the law.\n\nAs for privacy policies and cookie policies, it really depends on your preferences and the needs of your clients. Some plugins, like Cookiebot, can generate basic policies for you based on your settings and configurations. However, for more customized policies, you might want to consider working with a legal professional to ensure everything is thorough and legally sound.\n\nIn my experience, it's always a good idea to have a lawyer review your policies, especially if you're dealing with sensitive data or operating in multiple jurisdictions. It might seem like an extra step, but it's worth it for the peace of mind and protection it provides.\n\nHope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions!\n\n### Comment ID l1umran with +1 score by [(Bluesky4meandu, Reddit, 2024-04-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1cfvgtd/how_do_you_handle_cookies_and_gdpr/l1umran/) (in reply to ID l1rnhqx):\nHonestly, in this day and age you don't need a lawyer.

No you can't, now you're in the lava GG.). \n\nEnter in this Commander, offering to help people. Again, I'm being stubborn because I'm old school I don't need no help! But then... I saw him. Dressed as the Joker, named Jack Napier (I think), and playing a character. Suddenly, he was Batman asking if we had seen any criminals. Then he was the Hulk, before back to Joker. Every time, stayed in character AND dressed to the T for that character.

I find the ideas of fear-themed things so fascinating (explanation in captions) with +18 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/picrew/comments/12vzm2b/my_ocs_as_their_biggest_fears_i_find_the_ideas_of/)\nOsano's fear stems from being transspecies. He was born a siren to a siren family, and he always struggled with breathing water. Once he transitioned into being a human, he swore off the ocean, and ended up having vividly realistic nightmares of drowning, to the point where he avoids water at all costs. To the point where he struggles to shower, go to the bathroom, or even drink water without his intrusive thoughts freaking him out.\n\nKit's fear stems from before he could remember. He was a bastard son, and he was forced to live with his mom's husband after the divorce. Turns out, this kind of pushed his dad over the edge, so when Kit was only one, his dad tried to bury him alive. Thankfully, he was stopped by neighbors who heard Kit screaming, but this didn't stop Kit from having (you guessed it) nightmares about the incident.\n\nSkye used to be a part of an organized crime ring. Her dad's favorite party trick was to throw alcohol at people who swindled him, then light them on fire. Turns out, seeing someone cook from the outside takes a toll on some people. In fact, Skye used to be an alcoholic, but she quit after stumbling across a video of someone getting drunk, trying to light their breath on fire, and accidentally catching fire themselves.\n\nOwen literally died of hypothermia, so as a spirit, he has frigophobia.\n\n## Comment ID jhdhtui with +3 score by [(broken-lycan, Reddit, 2023-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/picrew/comments/12vzm2b/my_ocs_as_their_biggest_fears_i_find_the_ideas_of/jhdhtui/) (in reply to ID 12vzm2b):\nooooh this is really interesting!!\n\n## Comment ID jhe8ipl with +2 score by [(ReaperofLightning872, Reddit, 2023-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/picrew/comments/12vzm2b/my_ocs_as_their_biggest_fears_i_find_the_ideas_of/jhe8ipl/) (in reply to ID 12vzm2b):\nscary things are cool\n\n## Comment ID jhd8q5d with +1 score by [(AutoModerator, Reddit, 2023-04-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/picrew/comments/12vzm2b/my_ocs_as_their_biggest_fears_i_find_the_ideas_of/jhd8q5d/) (in reply to ID 12vzm2b):\nHi!

It's about the mindset and approach of the leaders. I've never felt so empowered yet supported by everyone from my manager to my direct team members. The culture is very curious, not judgemental. This leads to really open discussions with diverse perspectives that result in great ideas and actionable plans. \n\nThe culture is also very family-first. Go to your son's fall festival, take time to see your parents, take a few days to help your sister move, step away to go pick up your kids. We all do it. \n\nOther pros include: \n- The company is on fire. It's in a rapidly growing space and we have the best product by far.\n- You get to work alongside people are who REALLY good at what they do. Sure, we're all still growing our crafts, but man have we hired some experts. \n- Everything is really well organized. From onboarding to IT requests, it's so well automated. \n- Transparent company OKRs help the company stay focused and aligned \n- Swag quality is top notch :)",

      "# [Data Privacy Laws: What You Need to Know in 2025 by Osano Staff on 2024-08-12](https://www.osano.com/articles/data-privacy-laws)\nVirtually every country has enacted some sort of data privacy law to regulate how information is collected, how data subjects are informed, and what control a data subject has over their information once it is transferred. Failure to follow applicable data privacy laws may lead to fines, lawsuits, and even prohibiting a site's use in certain jurisdictions. Navigating these laws and regulations can be daunting, but all website operators should be familiar with data privacy laws that affect their users.\n\nNew and Upcoming Data Privacy Laws in 2025\n\nIt's important to remain cognizant of existing data privacy laws, but perhaps you just want to review what's new in 2025 and beyond.\n\nU.S. Data Privacy Laws\n\nDespite numerous proposals over the years, no one comprehensive federal law governs data privacy in the U.S. yet. In the meantime, individual states have acted rather than wait on the federal government. There's a complex patchwork of sector-specific and medium-specific laws, including laws and regulations that address telecommunications, health information, credit information, financial institutions, and marketing.\n\nThe FTC\n\nAn important enforcement agency in the U.S. is the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Its authority to regulate on behalf of consumer protections comes from The Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), which has broad jurisdiction over commercial entities under its authority to prevent unfair or \"deceptive trade practices.\"\n\nWhile the FTC uses its authority to issue regulations, enforce privacy laws, and take enforcement actions to protect consumers. For example, the FTC might take impose action against organizations that:\n\nFail to implement and maintain reasonable data security measures\n\nFail to abide by any applicable self-regulatory principles of the organization's industry\n\nFail to follow a published privacy policy\n\nTransfer personal information in a manner not disclosed in the privacy policy\n\nMake inaccurate privacy and security representations (i.e., lying) to consumers and in privacy policies\n\nFail to provide sufficient security for personal data\n\nViolate consumer data privacy rights by collecting, processing, or sharing consumer information\n\nEngage in misleading advertising practices\n\nOther federal laws that govern the collection of information online include:\n\nThe Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which governs the collection of information about minors\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act (HIPAA), which governs the collection of health information\n\nThe Gramm Leach Bliley Act (GLBA), which governs personal information collected by banks and financial institutions\n\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which regulates the collection and use of credit information\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which protects the privacy of student education records\n\nState Privacy Laws\n\nThe U.S. also has hundreds of sectoral data privacy and data security laws among its states. State attorneys general oversee data privacy laws governing the collection, storage, safeguarding, disposal, and use of personal data collected from their residents, especially regarding data breach notifications and the security of Social Security numbers. Some apply only to governmental entities, others to private entities, and others apply to both.\n\nIn addition to sectoral privacy laws, the U.S. is experiencing a massive drive toward pushing privacy legislation at the state level. That’s because the federal government hasn’t been able to find a consensus on how to legislate broadly. Rather than wait, state lawmakers have been nudged by consumers, consumer advocates, and even companies to set their own rules.\n\nOf course, companies would rather comply with a single federal standard than hire attorneys and privacy professionals, invest in compliance tools, and establish a robust compliance program that covers all applicable state laws. But states see the lack of any data privacy protections as more damaging than overly complex data privacy protections.\n\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)\n\nThe most comprehensive state data privacy legislation to date is the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). The CPRA was passed by a ballot initiative in November 2020 and amended California’s previous state privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). It went into effect on January 1, 2023.\n\nThe CPRA is cross-sector legislation that introduces important definitions and broad individual consumer rights and imposes substantial duties on entities or persons that collect personal information about or from a California resident. These duties include informing data subjects when and how data is collected; allowing them to opt-out of data collection; allowing them to access, correct, and delete such information; and restricting how businesses can transfer personal information to other entities.\n\nMany of the above requirements were also included in the CCPA, but once the CPRA passed, the law was amended to include the following:\n\nRight to rectification: This updates and adds to a consumer’s right to correct inaccurate personal information.\n\nRight to restriction: This grants consumers the right to limit the use and disclosure of their sensitive personal information.\n\nSensitive personal information: This updates the definition of personal information. Certain types of information, like a consumer’s Social Security number, must be treated with special protections.\n\nThe CPRA also:\n\nIncreased fines for breaches of children’s data threefold\n\nExpanded breach liability beyond breaches of unencrypted data to disclosures of credentials (like an email address or password) that could lead to access to a consumer’s account\n\nLimited the duration of time a company may retain a consumer’s information to only what’s necessary and “proportionate” to the reason it was collected in the first place\n\nRequires companies working with third parties, contractors, and outside service providers to contractually mandate that those organizations exercise the same level of privacy protection to data shared with them as the first party\n\nOne of the most significant features of the CPRA is its enforcement. While state attorneys general typically handle privacy cases—unless the FTC is involved, and even then, it’s often a partnership—the CPRA establishes a new privacy regulator.\n\nThe California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) can fine transgressors, hold hearings about privacy violations, and clarify privacy guidelines. It’s a five-member board, and it starts enforcing six months after the CPRA goes into effect on July 1, 2023.\n\nVirginia's Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA)\n\nVirginia's Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA) was passed on March 2, 2021. It grants Virginia consumers certain rights over their data and requires companies covered by the law to comply with rules on the data they collect, how it's treated and protected, and with whom it's shared.\n\nThe law contains some similarities to the EU General Data Protection Regulation's (GDPR) provisions and the CPRA. It applies to entities that do business in Virginia or sell products and services targeted to Virginia residents and also meet one of the following:\n\nControl or process the personal data of 100,000 or more\n\nControl or process the personal data of at least 25,000 consumers and earn 50% of their revenue by selling personal information\n\nThe CDPA requires companies covered by the law to assist consumers in exercising their data rights by obtaining opt-in consent before processing their sensitive data (non-sensitive data may be collected so long as the consumer is notified), disclosing when their data will be sold, and allowing them to opt-out of data collection. It also requires companies to provide users with a clear privacy notice that enables consumers to opt-out of targeted advertising. In addition, it requires data brokers to honor consumers’ requests to opt out of data processing, among other requirements.\n\nThe CDPA went into effect on January 1, 2023.\n\nColorado Privacy Act (CPA)\n\nIn June 2020, Colorado became the third U.S. state to pass a privacy law. The Colorado Privacy Act grants Colorado residents rights over their data and places obligations on data controllers and processors. It contains some similarities to California's CPRA, Virginia's CDPA, and the EU’s GDPR.\n\nWhile there are similarities, such as some form of a right to opt-out, special protections for sensitive data, and the adoption of some privacy-by-design principles, the significant differences are in the details.\n\nThe CPA applies to businesses that collect personal data from 100,000 Colorado residents or collect data from 25,000 Colorado residents and derive revenue from the sale of that data.\n\nThe law lists five rights granted to Colorado residents once the law becomes effective on July 1, 2023. They are:\n\nThe right to opt-out of targeted ads, the sale of their personal data, or being profiled\n\nThe right to access the data a company has collected about them\n\nThe right to correct data that's been collected about them\n\nThe right to request the data collected about them is deleted\n\nThe right to data portability (that is, the right to take your data and move it to another company)\n\nThere are 17 blanket exemptions within the law. Data exemptions include:\n\nIf the data was collected for Colorado health insurance law purposes\n\nIf the entity collecting the data or the data collected is already covered by certain sectoral laws, including COPPA or the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\n\nIf the data has been de-identified or pseudonymized\n\nIf the data is being maintained and used by a consumer reporting agency\n\nIf the data is being used for employment records purposes\n\nSince the law goes into effect midway through 2023, businesses should expect updates to the law via rulemaking in the first half of the year.\n\nUtah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA)\n\nIn March 2022, Utah became the fourth state to enact a comprehensive consumer privacy law, which will take effect on December 31, 2023. The Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA) draws from the CDPA, CPA, and CPRA.\n\nThe law applies to both data controllers and processors that generate over $25 million in annual revenue and either:\n\nControl or process personal data for over 100,000 consumers yearly, or\n\nDerive over 50% of the entity’s gross revenue from the sale of personal data and controls or processes the personal data of 25,000 or more consumers.\n\nSimilarly to the statutes in Colorado and Virginia, there are exemptions for certain types of personal data; however, they’re broader at both the entity and data levels.\n\nThe law does not apply to governmental entities or third parties acting on behalf of a governmental entity, tribes, institutions of higher education, nonprofit corporations, business associates, information that meets the definition of protected health information for HIPAA and related regulations, and more.\n\nFinancial institutions governed by the GLBA (the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) and information in the FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act) also aren’t subject to the UCPA. Data processed or maintained in the course of employment is also exempt.\n\nConsumers have the right to:\n\nConfirm whether a controller is processing their personal data and accessing or deleting personal data provided\n\nObtain a copy of their personal data in a portable, accessible format\n\nOpt-out of processing of personal data for targeted advertising or sale\n\nIn contrast to the CDPA and CPA, the UCPA does not include the right to opt-out of profiling nor codify the right to correct inaccuracies in their data.\n\nConnecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA)\n\nConnecticut's fifth and most recent state to adopt a comprehensive consumer privacy law. Senate Bill 6, or “An Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring” (CTDPA), went into effect July 1, 2023.\n\nThe law also draws from Virginia and Colorado’s statutes, with a few departures. It applies to businesses that, during the preceding calendar year:\n\nControlled or processed personal data of 100,000 or more Connecticut residents, excluding residents whose personal data is controlled or processed solely to complete a payment transaction; or\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of not less than 25,000 consumers and derived more than 25% of their gross revenue from the sale of personal data.\n\nThe law is the first to specify that payment transaction data is not subject to the law, which is for small businesses that process information to complete a transaction, such as restaurants. Consumers can opt out of data processing for the purposes of targeted advertisements, sale to a third party, and profiling.\n\nThe state allowed a 60-day period to remedy violations, though the cure period expired December 31, 2024.\n\nMontana Consumer Data Privacy Act (MTCDPA)\n\nMontana Governor Greg Gianforte signed the Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act (MTCDPA) into law on May 19, 2023, and the law went into effect on October 1, 2024.\n\nThe MTCDPA applies to any data controller that handles the personal data of at least 50,000 Montana residents, except for data used exclusively for payment transactions. Additionally, controllers that manage personal data from at least 25,000 consumers and derive more than 25% of their revenue from selling personal data also must comply with the law. Notably, there is no revenue threshold associated with the MTCDPA.\n\nUnder the law, Montanans have the right to opt out of the sale of their personal data, the right to know if a controller is processing their personal information and access to that data, the right to request the correction of inaccurate or outdated information, the right to ask a controller to delete their personal data, the right to portability, and the right to not be discriminated against for exercising their rights.\n\nThe MTCDPA includes the usual range of exemptions, including government agencies, nonprofits, higher education institutions, national securities associations registered under the Securities Exchange Act, organizations governed by GLBA, and organizations subject to HIPAA.\n\nOne of the more unique features of the law is that it doesn't specify a particular dollar amount for fines or other statutory damages for breaking the law. It simply states that the Attorney General can take legal action. Businesses will also have a 60-day cure period to address any violations, though this period expires April 1, 2026.\n\nTennessee Information Protection Act (TIPA)\n\nThe Tennessee Information Protection Act (TIPA), signed into law in May 2023 and effective from July 1, 2025, positions Tennessee among states taking proactive steps in consumer privacy. The TIPA applies to businesses exceeding $25 million in revenue that engage with Tennessee or its residents and either:\n\nControl or process the personal information of at least 175,000 consumers.\n\nControl or process the personal information of at least 25,000 consumers and derive more than 50 percent of gross revenue from the sale of personal information.\n\nConsumer rights under TIPA include the ability to confirm, access, correct, delete, and obtain personal information. The law places responsibilities on data controllers, emphasizing data minimization, security practices, and non-discrimination.\n\nIn contrast with other state laws, the TIPA provides a narrower applicability threshold, a generous two-plus-year on-ramp period for businesses, and an affirmative defense option for those with written privacy programs aligned with specified frameworks like NIST. In this circumstance, an affirmative defense helps protect businesses against liability. Because of these and other unique features, the TIPA is one of the more business-friendly U.S. privacy laws.\n\nEnforcement falls under the state attorney general, with a 60-day cure period for violators. Penalties may include fines up to $7,500 per violation, with the potential for tripled damages for willful violations.\n\nOregon Consumer Privacy Act (OCPA)\n\nThe Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (OCPA) represents Oregon's response to the absence of a federal privacy law. Signed into law in July 2023, the OCPA became effective on July 1, 2024, concurrently with Texas's privacy law. The law applies to businesses conducting operations in Oregon or providing services to its residents and either:\n\nControl or process the personal data of 100,000 or more consumers.\n\nControl or process the personal data of 25,000 or more consumers while deriving a quarter or more of their annual gross revenue from selling personal data.\n\nNotable exemptions to the OCPA involve information governed by acts like HIPAA and GLBA like other state laws. However, the OCPA is distinct that entities subject to these acts must still comply with the OCPA for non-covered data. The law grants consumers the usual rights, including access, correction, deletion, and opt-out options for targeted advertising or profiling. Controllers must respond to requests within 45 days, extendable by an additional 45 days, and provide justification for any rejection.\n\nUnique features of the OCPA include its data-level exemptions for HIPAA and GLBA (as opposed to entity-level exemptions) and its broad definition of sensitive data. The OCPA includes the usual items under the umbrella of sensitive data, but also includes data types like an individual’s status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, and more.\n\nEnforcement falls under the state attorney general, with potential fines up to $7,500 per violation. Unlike some state laws, the OCPA incorporates a 30-day right to cure, a five-year statute of limitations, and provisions for additional fees if the attorney general prevails in an action.\n\nTexas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA)\n\nThe Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA), signed into law on June 18, 2023, by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, positions Texas as the second-largest state (after California) to enact a comprehensive data privacy law.\n\nUnique aspects of the TDPSA include a deviation from traditional applicability criteria, replacing revenue-based thresholds with a focus on businesses conducting operations in Texas and offer products or services consumed by Texas residents, or businesses that process or sell personal data. Notably, it introduces a novel small business provision, and while exclusions exist for entities such as state agencies and financial institutions, the law does not provide a general exemption for entities governed by HIPAA or GLBA, requiring compliance for non-covered data.\n\nConsumer rights granted by the TDPSA align with common privacy laws, allowing residents to confirm, correct, delete, and obtain copies of their personal data, along with opting out of targeted advertising or data sale. The law became enforceable on July 1, 2024. Businesses gaining a grace period until January 1, 2025, to comply with the global opt-out technology provision. A distinctive feature is the perpetual 30-day cure period, allowing violators to rectify breaches and avoid penalties by providing the attorney general with evidence of compliance.\n\nThe TDPSA introduces unique provisions, such as additional disclosures for companies selling sensitive or biometric information, and explicit notices for data sale on targeted advertising.\n\nThe law is enforceable by the state attorney general, who can issue fines of up to $7,500 per violation.\n\nIowa Consumer Data Protection Act (ICDPA)\n\nThe Iowa Consumer Data Protection Act (ICDPA) was signed into law in late March, 2023, by Governor Kim Reynolds, and goes into effect on January 1, 2025.\n\nThe ICDPA applies to businesses controlling or processing the personal data of at least 100,000 Iowa consumers or 25,000 consumers with over 50% of gross revenue from data sales. Exemptions include data regulated by the FCRA, state agencies, financial institutions under GLBA, and entities complying with HIPAA.\n\nConsumer rights under the ICDPA include confirmation of data processing, deletion rights, access to personal data, and the right to opt out of data sales. While similar to other state laws, ICDPA notably lacks explicit provisions for the right to correct personal data and the right to opt out of profiling. In response to consumers exercising their rights, the law sets a 90-day timeline for responses and requires businesses to provide information free of charge up to twice annually per consumer.\n\nEnforcement, managed by the state attorney general, incorporates a perpetual 90-day cure period for violators before fines of $7,500 per violation are imposed. The ICDPA does not grant a private right of action.\n\nIndiana Consumer Data Protection Act (INCDPA)\n\nThe Indiana Consumer Data Protection Act (INCDPA) became the seventh state to adopt a privacy law on May 1, 2023. Effective from January 1, 2026, the INCDPA follows the footsteps of similar state laws, emphasizing consumer rights and establishing guidelines for data safeguarding.\n\nThe INCDPA applies to businesses operating in Indiana or selling products and services to Indiana residents that control or process personal data of either 100,000 or 25,000 Indiana residents. Unlike other data privacy laws, the INCDPA doesn't solely rely on a revenue threshold, requiring compliance even if annual gross revenues fall below a specific limit.\n\nConsumer rights granted by the INCDPA include the ability to correct data inaccuracies; opt out of targeted advertising, data sales, or specific profiling; confirm data processing; and request the deletion of personal data. Exemptions exclude state entities, affiliates of financial institutions, organizations subject to HIPAA, non-profit entities, higher education institutions, and public utility entities. Controllers must adhere to principles like data minimization, implement security measures, and conduct data protection impact assessments (DPIA) for specific data processing activities. These include targeted advertising, data sale, profiling with foreseeable risks, processing of sensitive data, and other activities with heightened risk.\n\nEnforcement of the INCDPA involves a 30-day cure period for alleged violations before civil penalties of up to $7,500 per violation are imposed. The attorney general oversees enforcement and may grant injunctive relief. The law emphasizes a business-friendly approach, providing a substantial window for compliance preparation.\n\nDelaware Personal Data Privacy Act (DPDPA)\n\nDelaware joined the growing list of U.S. states enacting comprehensive data privacy legislation with the Delaware Personal Data Privacy Act (DPDPA), positioned as one of the nation's most robust data privacy bills. While California still holds the title for the strongest data privacy law, the DPDPA is notable for its consumer-friendly approach and broader applicability, encompassing businesses of varying sizes. Set to take effect on January 1, 2025, the law grants an additional year for businesses to implement universal opt-out mechanisms in 2026.\n\nApplicability under the DPDPA is extensive, covering any company conducting business in Delaware or offering products/services targeting state residents. The thresholds for compliance are set at processing the personal data of at least 35,000 consumers or 10,000 consumers with over 20% of gross revenue derived from personal data sales. Notably, the 35,000-consumer threshold is the lowest among existing data privacy laws, making the DPDPA applicable to a broader range of small and medium-sized companies.\n\nExemptions under the DPDPA include government bodies, financial institutions subject to the GLBA, and various types of data, such as protected health information under HIPAA. Consumer rights align with other state laws, encompassing the right to confirm and access personal data, correct inaccuracies, delete data, obtain data copies, receive a list of third-party disclosures, and opt-out of targeted advertising, data sale, or profiling. Controllers are obliged to limit data collection to what is necessary, implement security measures, and obtain opt-in consent for sensitive data or data of known children.\n\nEnforcement falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice, allowing a cure period for violators, albeit with a sunset provision ending on January 1, 2026. The Department may investigate and prosecute violations, potentially resulting in penalties up to $10,000 per violation. The law also mandates data protection assessments for activities with a heightened risk of harm to consumers, such as targeted advertising or processing sensitive data.\n\nNebraska Data Privacy Act (NDPA)\n\nThe Nebraska Data Privacy Act (NDPA) is a comprehensive data privacy act designed to protect consumers and give them control over their personal information. It grants them certain rights, outlined below, and provides controllers, or the entity that determines the purpose and means of processing personal data, with specific requirements for how to handle data and consumer requests related to their data.\n\nThe law’s scope tracks closely with the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA), including its applicability, sensitive data, and its requirement to honor universal opt-out mechanisms.\n\nLike the TDPSA, Nebraska’s privacy law applies to a person who:\n\nConducts business in the state or produces a product or service consumed by residents of Nebraska;\n\nProcesses or engages in the sale of personal data; and\n\nIs not a small business as determined under the federal Small Business Act.\n\nOne notable aspect of the NDPA’s applicability is that, unlike most other state laws, there is no revenue or volume of data processed.\n\nLike many other comprehensive data privacy laws, the state attorney general has enforcement authority of the data privacy act. The law stipulates that the attorney general must first notify the controller or processor of the violation in writing and provide a 30-day cure period—luckily for Nebraska businesses, this cure period does not sunset, unlike other state data privacy laws.\n\nIn addition to curing the violation, the controller or process must also provide a written statement and supportive documentation to show the violation was cured and stating that they will not commit another violation.\n\nThose who don’t cure a violation during the 30-day timeframe, or who breach their written statement, will be subject to a $7,500 fine for each infraction.\n\nNew Hampshire Privacy Act (NHPA)\n\nThe New Hampshire Privacy Act (NHPA) is one of a number of statewide data privacy laws aimed at giving consumers control over their personal data in an increasingly digital world.\n\nThe good news for businesses is that the NHPA largely resembles other data privacy laws that have come before it. It is most closely aligned to those in Virginia (VCDPA) and Connecticut (CTDPA)—though there are slight nuances.\n\nThe law is slated to take effect January 1, 2025, and will apply to “persons that conduct business” in the state or who produce products or services targeted to residents of New Hampshire and who, during a one-year period:\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of not less than 35,000 unique consumers, excluding if the processing occurred solely to complete a payment transaction, or\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of not less than 10,000 unique consumers and derived more than 25 percent of their gross revenue from the sale of personal data.\n\nThe New Hampshire data privacy act’s scope is somewhat unique in that it doesn’t include a revenue threshold. Additionally, the applicability threshold is lower than other laws, but lawmakers have pointed out that this is because of the state’s lower population.\n\nLike other U.S. laws, the NHPA follows primarily an opt-out model, meaning businesses are free to process consumer data, but must notify consumers about the processing first and give them a way to opt out of the collection or sale of data. There are exceptions, however, for the data of children under the age of 13 and for sensitive data. Here, opt-in permission is required.\n\nOther notable provisions include:\n\nThe NHPA will require businesses to recognize universal opt-out mechanisms, such as the Global Privacy Control.\n\nThe act has a 60-day cure period for violations that sunsets one year after the law is enacted (in January 2026).\n\nNew Jersey Data Privacy Act (NJDPA)\n\nThe New Jersey Data Protection Act (NJDPA) is a data privacy law that gives New Jersey residents control over their personal data, providing certain rights and imposing obligations on those who control and process consumer data. The law applies to businesses and entities who conduct business in the state or who produce products or services targeted to those who live in New Jersey.\n\nIn terms of applicability and exemptions, New Jersey’s privacy law aligns with other state laws. It applies to controllers who, during a calendar year, meet one of the following criteria:\n\nControl or process the personal data of at least 100,000 consumers, excluding personal data processed solely for the purpose of completing a payment transaction, or\n\nControl or process the personal data of at least 25,000 consumers and the controller derives revenue or receives a discount on the price of any goods or services, from the sale of personal data.\n\nThere are a few key definitions in the law: the NJDPA defines “sale” as “sharing, disclosing, or transferring” data for money or other valuable consideration, similar to California’s law. A “controller” is an individual or legal entity that determines the purpose and means of processing personal data.\n\nSimilar to Colorado’s privacy law, it doesn’t define a specific percentage of revenue that must be derived from the sale of data, whereas other states have implemented a 25 or 50 percent threshold.\n\nThe law goes into effect in January 15, 2025, one year after its enactment.\n\nKentucky Consumer Data Protection Act (KCDPA)\n\nThe Kentucky Consumer Data Protection Ac (KCDPA) provides data privacy protections for consumers of the Bluegrass State, granting them certain, now standard rights. We’ll dive into more on that later.\n\nThe law defines consumers as residents of the state acting only as an individual, not in commercial or employment contexts. It closely aligns with Virginia’s law, which is good news for businesses already complying with the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA). And, because the VCDPA is considered a framework or foundation legislation, the KCDPA also tracks closely with other state laws that used Virginia’s law as a framework, including Tennessee and Indiana.\n\nBusinesses will become subject to the law as of January 1, 2026.\n\nSimilar to Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Indiana, Kentucky’s privacy act allows companies to collect and process most types of personal information without obtaining affirmative user consent first (in most cases). This is known as the opt-out model, which most U.S. data privacy laws follow.\n\nJust like Virginia’s law, the KCDPA applies to any person who conducts business in Kentucky or who produces products or services that target residents of the state, and during a calendar year controls or processes data of at least:\n\n100,000 consumers; or\n\n25,000 consumers and derives over 50 percent of gross revenue from the sale of personal data.\n\nLike all data privacy laws that came before it, the KCDPA applies to both controllers, or entities who determine the purpose and means of processing data, and processors, or entities that process personal data on behalf of a controller, such as a third-party vendor charged with analyzing data. The delineation between controllers and processors exists to clearly assign responsibilities for data governance between the parties involved in collecting and processing consumer data.\n\nMinnesota Consumer Data Privacy Act (MCDPA)\n\nThe MCDPA is a state-level legislation designed to safeguard the personal data of Minnesota residents. Rather than permit organizations to collect, process, and generally do whatever they wish with consumers’ personal information, data privacy regulations like the MCDPA:\n\nSet limits on what organizations can do with personal data\n\nRequire organizations to meet certain obligations, like setting safeguards, assessing for risk, and respecting consumer rights\n\nProvide consumers with data privacy rights that enable them to maintain control over their personal information\n\nOfficially enacted on May 24, 2024, the MCDPA will take effect on July 31, 2025. Once that happens, businesses will need to comply or potentially suffer penalties and fines from the state Attorney General.\n\nThe MCDPA applies to organizations that provide products or services targeted at Minnesotans and meet one of the following criteria:\n\nDuring a calendar year, they control or process the personal data of 100,000 consumers or more.\n\nThey derive more than 25 percent of gross revenue from the sale of personal data and process or control personal data of 25,000 consumers or more.\n\nAs is the case with most data privacy laws, the definition of “sale” includes both selling data for money and “other valuable considerations.”\n\nMaryland Online Data Privacy Act (MODPA)\n\nThe MODPA gives Maryland residents more control over how companies collect and use their personal data online. With an effective date of October 1, 2025, the new law establishes data protection rights and requires companies that track or target the state’s residents to meet stricter requirements around data collection—especially related to data minimization, consent, universal opt-out mechanisms, sensitive data, and children’s data. However, MODPA will not apply to companies’ data processing activities until April 1st, 2026.\n\nWhile it is an opt-out law (meaning consumers have the right to opt-out of processing data for certain purposes) Maryland’s privacy act is already known in the data privacy world as more stringent than many other state laws.\n\nMaryland’s privacy law applies to anyone who conducts business in the state, as well as those who provide services or products targeted to residents of Maryland and during the prior calendar year either:\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of at least 35,000 consumers, with the exception of personal data collected or processed solely for completing a payment transaction, or:\n\nControlled or processed the personal data of at least 10,000 consumers and derived more than 20 percent of its gross revenue from the sale of personal data.\n\nWith controller requirements and restrictions, the MODPA gets tricky. It differs from other state laws in a few key areas.\n\nIn Maryland, controllers are restricted from the collection, processing, and sharing of sensitive data, except where it’s strictly necessary to provide or maintain a specific product or service requested by the consumer.\n\nWhat’s more, controllers are banned altogether from selling sensitive data.\n\nThe Maryland Office of the Attorney General's Consumer Protection Division enforces the MCPA, which has fines of up to $10,000 per violation or $25,000 for each repetition of the same violation.\n\nThe Rhode Island Data Transparency and Privacy Protection Act (RIDTPPA)\n\nEnacted June 29, 2024, the RIDTPPA resembles many other US data privacy laws, including its requirements surrounding consent, sensitive personal information processing, and consumer rights. The law, however, does feature several important differences.\n\nNotably, the law also lacks a cure period. If you’re found to have violated the law, you’ll simply be fined without any grace period to fix the violation. Most state data privacy laws feature cure periods, though some expire at various dates in the future, and some are permanent features.\n\nThe law also does not require businesses to honor universal opt-out mechanisms.\n\nIf your organization is a for-profit entity and conducts business in Rhode Island or provides products or services targeted to Rhode Islanders, you may be subject to the RIDTPPA.\n\nSpecifically, you must meet the above criteria as well as one of the following:\n\nYour organization controlled or processed at least 35,000 state residents’ personal data.\n\nYour organization controlled or processed at least 10,000 state residents’ personal data and derived more than 20% of its gross revenue from the sale of that data.\n\nThere are exemptions, of course, but if you meet the above criteria, you likely will need to comply with the law.\n\nNew York SHIELD Act\n\nIn July 2019, New York passed the Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security (SHIELD) Act. This law amends New York's existing data breach notification law and creates more data security requirements for companies that collect information on New York residents. As of March 2020, the law is fully enforceable.\n\nThis law broadened the scope of consumer privacy and provides better protection for New York residents from data breaches of their personal information. It requires employers in possession of the New York residents’ private information to “develop, implement, and maintain reasonable safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the private information.”\n\nLast year, in 2022, the state Attorney General settled with an organization $600,000 for failing to meet minimum standards that led to a breach in security and a leak of personal information. While there have been no recent updates to the law, it is still very active and enforced, as shown by this settlement.\n\nCheck out our U.S. data privacy laws guide for a detailed summary.\n\nEuropean Data Privacy Laws\n\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation remains the law of the land, but new data privacy-related laws have been passed in the EU recently—notably, the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. Here's a refresher on the GDPR and a list of the other laws you should track to keep your organization up-to-date on data privacy in 2025.\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n\nThe most crucial data protection legislation enacted to date is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It governs the collection, use, transmission, and security of data collected from residents of any of the 28 member countries of the European Union. The law applies to all EU residents, regardless of the entity's location that collects the personal data. Fines of up to € 20 million or 4% of total global turnover may be imposed on organizations that fail to comply with the GDPR. Some essential requirements of the GDPR include:\n\nConsent\n\nData subjects must be allowed to give explicit, unambiguous consent before the collection of personal data. Personal data includes information collected through the use of cookies. Some information not usually considered \"personal information\" in the United States, such as the user's computer IP address, is considered to be \"personal data\" according to the GDPR.\n\nData Breach Notification\n\nOrganizations must notify supervisory authorities and data subjects within 72 hours if a data breach affects users' personal information in most cases.\n\nData Subjects' Rights\n\nData subjects (people whose data is collected and processed) have certain rights regarding their personal information. These rights should be communicated to data subjects in a clear, easy-to-access privacy policy on the organization's website.\n\nThe right to be informed. Data subjects must be informed about the collection and use of their personal data when the data is obtained.\n\nThe right to access their data. A data subject can request a copy of their personal data via a data subject request. Data controllers must explain the means of collection, what's being processed, and with whom it is shared.\n\nThe right of rectification. If a data subject's data is inaccurate or incomplete, they have the right to ask you to rectify it.\n\nThe right of erasure. Data subjects have the right to request the erasure of personal data related to them on certain grounds within 30 days.\n\nThe right to restrict processing. Data subjects have the right to request the restriction or suppression of their personal data (though you can still store it).\n\nThe right to data portability. Data subjects can have their data transferred from one electronic system to another at any time safely and securely without disrupting its usability.\n\nThe right to object. Data subjects can object to how their information is used for marketing, sales, or non-service-related purposes. The right to object does not apply where legal or official authority is carried out, a task is carried out for public interest, or when the organization needs to process data to provide you with a service for which you signed up.\n\nDigital Services Act (DSA)\n\nThe new regulation addresses illegal and harmful content by compelling platforms such as Google and Facebook to remove content that doesn’t meet certain standards. The primary principle is “what is illegal offline must be illegal online,” according to the Council of the EU. The Digital Services Act (DSA) entered into force on November 16, 2022.\n\nIt applies to four categories of businesses:\n\nIntermediary services offering network infrastructure, such as ISPs\n\nHosting services, such as cloud and web-hosting services\n\nOnline platforms that bring sellers and consumers together, such as online marketplaces, social platforms, and app stores\n\nVery large online platforms, which are defined as online platforms that reach more than 10% of the 450 million consumers in Europe\n\nEach category faces different requirements.\n\nAll of the above categories must:\n\nEngage in transparency reporting on court orders and actions taken, content moderation efforts, and more\n\nUpdate terms of service to account for fundamental rights\n\nCooperate with national authorities\n\nEstablish points of contact for authorities and, when necessary, legal representatives\n\nHosting services, online platforms, and very large online platforms must:\n\nProvide a notice-and-action mechanism enabling users to note potential illegal content for the business to remove\n\nReport criminal offenses\n\nOnline platforms and very large platforms must:\n\nImplement a complaint and redress mechanism\n\nIdentify trusted flaggers whose expertise adds special weight to their content notices\n\nTake measures against abusive notices and counter-notices\n\nIf they have a marketplace feature, take special actions, such as vetting third-party suppliers’ credentials, adhering to compliance-by-design principles, and more\n\nNot target advertisements to children or target advertisements based on users’ special characteristics\n\nProvide transparency into content recommendation systems\n\nProvide user-facing transparency into online advertising practices\n\nVery large platforms must:\n\nAdopt risk management practices and establish crisis response protocols\n\nAcquiesce to external, independent auditing, establish an internal compliance function, and be publicly accountable\n\nProvide users the choice to not be subject to content recommendations based on profiling\n\nShare data with authorities and researchers\n\nAdhere to self-drafted codes of conduct\n\nCooperate with authorities during crisis response situations\n\nEU data protection authorities may access, obtain information from, and inspect service providers to inform orders and sanctions. If a business is found to be in violation, it may be fined up to 6% of annual global turnover during the preceding financial year. If an information obligation under the DSA is violated, the maximum penalty is limited to 1% of the previous year’s income or global turnover.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act (DMA)\n\nThe Digital Markets Act (DMA) covers the largest digital platforms, known as “gatekeepers,” which include companies like Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, and Google. The DMA aims to level the playing field for digital companies and prevent gatekeeper companies from imposing unfair conditions on their competitors. For example, a company like Amazon isn’t allowed to rank products on its site in a way that gives Amazon’s own products and services an advantage.\n\nA company is considered a gatekeeper if it:\n\nHas a strong economic position, significant impact on the EU market, and is active in multiple EU member states\n\nHas a strong position as an intermediary linking a large user base to a large number of businesses\n\nHas or will soon have an entrenched position in the market, which is determined by whether or not the company met the two previous criteria in the last three financial years\n\nUnder the DMA, businesses that qualify as gatekeepers must:\n\nNot engage in self-preferencing, where the gatekeeper promotes their own products and services over an equivalent third-party product or service on the gatekeeper’s platform\n\nNot reuse users’ data outside of the context in which it was originally collected without consent\n\nNot track users outside of the gatekeepers’ platform for the purpose of targeted advertising without consent\n\nPermit communication and content access between businesses and end users\n\nEnsure price and fee transparency in advertising intermediation services\n\nProvide access to marketing or advertising performance data on the platform to users\n\nMake it easy for users to change their default settings and uninstall software\n\nEnsure third-party technology can interoperate with the gatekeeper’s own\n\nEnsure end users’ data is portable to other systems\n\nProvide businesses with real-time access to their data on the gatekeeper’s platform\n\nNot prevent users from making complaints to authorities\n\nNot require user registration to additional services as a condition of accessing a given service\n\nNot use businesses’ non-public data to compete against them\n\nAnd more\n\nGatekeepers that violate the DMA may be subject to fines of up to 10% of annual global turnover or up to 20% in the case of repeated violations. What’s more, repeated violations may result in non-financial remedies, such as forced divestitures.\n\nThe EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework\n\nAlthough it isn't a law per se, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework is an important factor to be aware of.\n\nPreviously, businesses transferring EU citizens’ data into the U.S. relied on a framework called the Privacy Shield to ensure the data was sufficiently protected, but that framework was deemed invalid during the Schrems II court case. This forced businesses to rely on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission to provide legal protection for data transfers.\n\nHowever, these clauses are somewhat shaky, which is why there was pressure to get a replacement for the Privacy Shield stood up.\n\nOn July 10, 2023, the new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework went into effect. It includes additional security measures, a redress mechanism for EU and U.S. citizens who feel their rights have been violated, and greater protections for foreign citizens’ data that has been transferred to the U.S. Additionally, the framework requires intelligence agencies to make updates to surveillance-related policies and procedures, followed by a review by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.\n\nWhile the framework improves upon the Privacy Shield, it's not without its flaws. There will likely be criticisms from European privacy advocacy groups, but if the framework survives, it could be the method businesses use to transfer data between the EU and U.S.\n\nThe EU AI Act\n\nThe EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act was approved on 16 June 2023 and is expected to go into effect sometime in late 2025 or early 2026. It applies to any company doing business in the EU that develops or adopts “high-risk” AI systems. These systems affect employment, credit, health care, and other critical domains.\n\nThe EU AI Act applies extraterritorially, meaning the law will cover companies based elsewhere if they have customers or users inside the EU, effectively making it a global regulation.\n\nUnder the Act, businesses with applicable AI systems have to:\n\nConduct impact assessments, keep records, and meet transparency obligations\n\nNot develop systems that can be used to manipulate a person’s behavior in a manner that could cause mental or physical harm.\n\nNot develop systems that can be used to exploit the vulnerabilities of a specific group due to their age, physical or mental disabilities, or behavior in a manner that could cause psychological or physical harm.\n\nNot develop systems that could exploit vulnerable groups based on age, or physical or mental disability.\n\nNot develop systems that provide real-time remote biometric data in publicly accessible spaces by law enforcement.\n\nOther International Data Privacy Laws\n\nWith over 130 data privacy laws across the globe, it isn’t feasible to list and describe each and every one in this blog post. However, here are some important regulations that may apply to your business.\n\nBrazil’s General Law for the Protection of Personal Data, or the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD): This law came into effect in 2020 and contains many similar provisions to the GDPR. Learn more about the law in our dedicated blog article, The definitive guide to Brazil's privacy law, the LGPD.\n\nCanada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA): PIPEDA was assented to in 2000, came into full force in 2004, and was considered a progressive law at the time. It was last updated in 2015 by the Data Privacy Act but still falls short of the GDPR’s regulatory standard.\n\nChina’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL): PIPL was enacted into law in November of 2021 and broadly maps to the GDPR’s stipulations. However, it does vary in some of its details, notably by giving individuals fewer rights, requiring a stricter standard for consent, and imposing harsher penalties.\n\nIndia's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA): Significantly, this law covers all of India's 1.4 billion people. While the law broadly mirrors the GDPR, it includes some variation, notably in the form of government exemptions.\n\nReduce Complexity and Risk With a Compliance Platform",

      "# [5 Emerging Data Privacy Trends in 2025 by Matt Davis, CIPM (IAPP) on 2024-12-26](https://www.osano.com/articles/data-privacy-trends)\nHeraclitus said that “The only constant in life is change,” but privacy professionals don’t need to turn to ancient Greek philosophy to grasp this concept. We can just use our eyes and observe our colleagues, industry, governments, and world. Data privacy is constantly changing, and 2025 won’t be an exception.\n\nKnowing that data privacy is changing and knowing how it’s changing, however, are two very different things.\n\nHere at Osano, we’re lucky enough to interact with a great many privacy professionals, businesses, and thought leaders in different industries and countries. As a result, we have a unique vantage point over the privacy landscape. Here's what we expect to see in 2025.\n\n1. Goodbye Chief Privacy Officers; Hello Multi-Hyphenates\n\nWhen the GDPR went into effect in 2018, many organizations believed that it would lead to the creation of a relatively new role—the privacy professional.\n\nThere are certainly enough responsibilities associated with privacy compliance to justify the creation of this role. At the same time, it’s true that privacy is a multi-disciplinary domain; there is virtually no element of the business that isn’t impacted by or relevant to data privacy.\n\nBusinesses are waking up to the efficiencies that can be gained by treating privacy as a holistic, cross-functional responsibility. New innovations, like AI, are adding to the privacy professional’s book of responsibilities as well. As a result, organizations are forgoing purely privacy-focused CPOs in favor of cross-functional, multi-hyphenate roles.\n\nWe explored this trend when Osano CEO Arlo Gilbert interviewed Google’s most recent CPO, Keith Enright, on an episode of The Privacy Insider podcast. Since Enright left, Google has not backfilled the role.\n\nOther major organizations like Mastercard, Zoom, and IBM are tweaking their CPO roles to package them with new AI responsibilities and other compliance domains.\n\nAccording to the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP), over 80% of privacy professionals gained responsibilities in 2024 alongside their existing privacy day jobs. In 2025, we expect this trend to continue and perhaps even intensify as best practices around AI management mature.\n\nMaybe you’re soon to be a Senior Head of Privacy, Trust, GRC, AI, and Other Acronyms as Applicable?\n\n2. AI Regulation Builds Up Momentum\n\nIn the 2000s and early 2010s, personal data processing was a bit like the Wild West. It took until 2016, with the adoption of the GDPR, for legislatures to become aware of the dangers associated with unrestricted collection and processing. After the GDPR went into effect in 2018, the need for modern comprehensive privacy protections became clear to the rest of the world.\n\nLegislatures don’t appear to be making the same mistake with AI. When ChatGPT came out in late 2022, regulators were off to the races, acknowledging the danger that LLMs and other novel AI technologies could pose to citizens and their rights. In the intervening years, new regulations and laws around AI have been released. In 2025, we expect this momentum to continue, and more businesses will have to contend with new requirements.\n\nAs of this writing, six American states have some kind of AI regulation in effect, with three more in the works. Colorado’s AI Act (CAIA) is among the most comprehensive. Although it goes into effect in early 2026, developers and users of AI systems will likely need a long runway to prepare for compliance.\n\nLike the CAIA, the EU’s AI Act enters fully into force in 2026. However, elements of the law go into effect over the course of 2025 as follows:\n\nProhibitions on AI systems that pose unacceptable risks take effect on February 2, 2025. These are systems that are simply too risky to deploy and are banned outright, including social scoring, biometric categorization systems, and untargeted scraping of facial data.\n\nRequirements for general-purpose AI models take effect on August 2, 2025. Among other requirements, developers of genAI will be obligated to assess and mitigate systemic risks, provide ample documentation on things like training data, provide adequate security, and more.\n\n3. Our Bet: The Majority of States Will Have a Privacy Law; We Won’t See a Federal Privacy Law\n\nSeven states passed comprehensive data privacy laws in 2024 and in 2023. If that pace continues in 2025, we could see 26 out of 50 states with their own privacy law. With more than half of US jurisdictions covered by a privacy law, it’ll be increasingly likely that businesses will be subject to at least some of these laws.\n\nThis explosion in state data privacy regulation also implies the implosion of a federal data privacy law’s prospects. As we’ve seen with proposed legislation like the APRA and ADPPA, states like California don’t want a weaker federal bill that essentially downgrades the privacy protections it offers to its citizens. The more states that have skin in the game, the less likely a nationwide law will be passed.\n\nThis isn’t ideal for businesses, as compliance with a single law would surely be easier than complying with potentially dozens. Check out our guide to US data privacy laws for a state-by-state overview.\n\n4. SRRs Take Center Stage\n\n2025 may very well be the year of subject rights requests (SRRs).\n\nThe IAPP reports that in 2023 (the latest year for which they have data), the average organization received around 3,000 SRRs. In North America specifically, that figure jumped to around 3,500.\n\nTo be fair, this figure is drawn from a sample of organizations employing IAPP members and is therefore biased toward organizations with enough privacy responsibilities that they employ a privacy professional. Nevertheless, with eight new data privacy laws coming online in 2025, more organizations are going to be on the hook for SRR response.\n\nNot only do more laws mean more organizations must honor SRRs, but they also translate to more consumer awareness. When residents in a newly covered jurisdiction hear about their new rights or the enforcement priorities of their state’s Attorney General, some portion will decide to exercise their subject rights.\n\nAs new laws come online, consent management will be important as well. However, more organizations understand the need for consent management (at least superficially). Seeing cookie banners on every website lends a lot to that awareness. In contrast, SRRs happen behind the scenes. Thus, it’s likely a number of organizations will be surprised by and unprepared for their new responsibilities to data subjects.\n\n5. As Always, Regulatory, Sectorial, and Private Enforcement Is on the Rise\n\nAs we covered earlier, eight new laws are coming online in 2025—and we can expect the attorneys general in those jurisdictions to show that they’ve got bite to match their bark. That will certainly be the case with California and Texas.\n\nThe California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) has announced a number of investigatory sweeps in 2024, and there’s every reason to expect that to continue in 2025. The state is also the only jurisdiction in the US (thus far) to issue financial penalties for non-compliance with its comprehensive data privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA; Sephora in 2022, DoorDash in early 2024, and Tilting Point Media in mid-2024).\n\nWhile Texas hasn’t issued any enforcement actions under the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA) as of this writing, the Texas Attorney General’s office has been very vocal about its intention to do so. The Texas Attorney General, however, has secured a settlement against an AI company for deceptive trade practices and issued a penalty against TikTok under the SCOPE act, which protects children’s data.\n\nIn terms of private enforcement, the plaintiff’s bar has repurposed the VPPA and various wiretapping laws to go after companies using tracking pixels on their websites. California, Arizona, and Florida are particularly known for such wiretapping cases.\n\nWhile this line of litigation has been very popular in 2024, it may become a degree less common, at least in Massachusetts, where the state Supreme Court ruled that the Wiretap Act does not cover website tracking technology. This ruling could influence other courts in the coming year—if not, we can expect more lawsuits of this nature.\n\nLast but not least, we can expect GDPR enforcement to continue apace. As of November 2024, there have been over 5.3 billion euros in GDPR penalties spread out over more than 2,200 fines.\n\nPrepare for These Changes with Osano\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned privacy pro or just had privacy tacked onto your list of responsibilities, meeting the challenges these trends present won’t be easy.\n\nIf, like many professionals, you’re finding your scope expanding, you’ll need a solution that automates tedious privacy tasks—that way, you can develop a holistic strategy across your responsibilities without having to worry about, for example, the nitty gritty of each privacy impact assessment.\n\nAnd if AI is among those new responsibilities, solutions for consent and notice management will be especially important. For now, there isn’t a reliable way to exercise the “right to be forgotten” for data ingested in an AI model, making it all the more important that consumers know when and where their data interacts with an AI system.\n\nYour organization may be subject to the new laws coming into effect in 2025 as well. Solutions like Osano have regulatory knowledge baked into their functionality, helping you keep track of multi-jurisdictional requirements. That includes subject rights management, which we predict will be especially challenging in 2025.",
      "# [AI and Data Privacy by Osano Staff on 2025-01-28](https://www.osano.com/articles/ai-and-data-privacy)\nThe advent of artificial intelligence and, more notably, generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has raised alarms all over the world. As with any innovation, the world is split between those excited for the chances it unlocks and the dangers it may pose.\n\nWe're going to take a closer look at the current landscape of AI and data privacy, AI regulation, and what companies and consumers can do to preserve privacy and privacy rights.\n\nWhat We Mean When We Talk About AI\n\nDefining artificial intelligence can actually be kind of tricky.\n\nStanford Professor John McCarthy, who coined the term “artificial intelligence,” defined it as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.” He further defined intelligence as “the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world.”\n\nLots of technologies could fall under that definition–content algorithms on social media networks, search engines, and more. But for modern audiences and regulators, artificial intelligence generally refers to systems that rely on machine learning techniques, large language models, generative AI systems, and the like. ChatGPT is probably the best known example of such systems.\n\nAI becomes problematic for privacy leaders, policymakers, and consumers alike when it’s trained on data that's sourced from a mix of pre-existing datasets, user interactions, sensors, corporate records, simulations, crowdsourcing, and APIs.\n\nAI technology is starving for data, and its appetite is only growing. For example, ChatGPT’s training dataset grew from 1.5 billion parameters to 175 billion parameters in just one year.\n\nAI's dependence on training data raises concerns over how it collects, stores, shares, or uses data. Privacy-centric policies—both at the corporate and legislative level—are needed to regulate where AI gets this data, how it gets it, and from whom.\n\nWhat We Mean When We Talk About Data Privacy\n\nData privacy refers to consumers' right to know about and control what happens to their personal information. By extension, data privacy also refers to the policies and practices implemented by businesses to protect and enable those rights.\n\nPersonal information is any information about a person that can be linked (directly or indirectly) back to them. That could mean a person's name, address, date of birth, social security number, etc.\n\nData privacy also concerns itself with sensitive personal information, which is information that could cause harm if it were mishandled or leaked, such as health records, banking information, biometrics, racial background, sexual orientation, religious views, and similar information.\n\nConsidering the huge amounts of data consumed by AI systems, you can imagine how much of that is personal, sensitive, private, or at least, used without the consumer's full understanding or consent (as we've seen with Clearview AI and numerous other companies).\n\nHow Does Artificial Intelligence Collect and Use Personal Data?\n\nAI collects data from various sources, many of which involve collecting data from consumers without their knowledge or consent. AI systems might scrape data from photos posted online, social media post interactions, security camera footage, fitness tracker data, purchase histories—pretty much any digital interaction can be used to train an AI.\n\nSometimes users are very clearly informed that their actions provide training data to an AI. Most people, for example, know that their interactions with ChatGPT help train the large language model. Other times, users are “informed” and “give consent” by accepting lengthy terms and conditions for a given product or service.\n\nOther times, there isn’t even the pretense of informing a user or securing their consent before their data is scraped into an AI model—as was the case with Clearview.\n\nConcerns About Privacy Risks of AI\n\nThe benefits of AI—whether that’s enabling us to complete our daily work more efficiently or making the world more accessible—likely outweigh the risks. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to mitigate those risks anyways. AI governance is still an evolving practice space. That means our privacy rights in the context of AI are receiving fewer protections than they deserve.\n\nHere are some of the risks to our privacy rights that we need to be cognizant of when working with AI.\n\nBias, Discrimination, & Inequality\n\nWhile responsible AI developers aim to weed out or reduce the influence of harmful data in training sets (i.e., data that perpetuates misinformation, harmful ideas, bigotry, sexism, inequality, or discrimination of any kind), many AI models are already being trained on biased data, and therefore are more likely to make biased decisions (e.g., denying a loan application) that can impact users on the commercial end of various AI applications.\n\nManipulation\n\nAI has been known to influence and control public perception. Technologies like deepfakes can be leveraged to spread misinformation, sway public opinion, and deceive individuals on a massive scale by exploiting their personal data and creating highly personalized and persuasive content.\n\nStrong data privacy measures can protect people from AI-driven manipulation. By limiting unauthorized access to personal data, privacy protections can help prevent AI from being used to influence decision-making without consent.\n\nIncreased Vulnerability to Data Breaches\n\nThe more personal data businesses collect and store, the greater the risk and impact of a breach. AI systems need vast quantities of data and incentivizes digital hoarding, which makes it all the more important for companies using AI to take stronger measures to protect their customer data.\n\nConsider Clearview AI, a for-profit facial recognition company serving federal agencies and retail companies alike. When Clearview AI was breached in 2020, it put countless people at risk. The company's technology relied on scraping over three billion user-uploaded photos from the web to help law enforcement track down suspects through facial recognition—but without consumers’ knowledge or consent.\n\nWhat Are Governments Doing About AI and Data Privacy?\n\nWhile lawmakers could be doing a lot more around the world to protect sensitive information from being used as AI training data, the EU AI Act and Colorado AI Act has shown us that things are starting to change.\n\nWhat Is the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act?\n\nComing into force on the 1st of August 2024, the act establishes a legal framework for AI and the entities that build and use AI systems on a professional level. Like the GDPR and CPRA, the EU AI Act applies to institutions and businesses from outside the European Union if their users are within the EU.\n\nHighlights of the act include:\n\nEstablished risk categories: AI applications are divided into five categories based on their risk of causing harm to individuals, from minimal to unacceptable, the latter of which is banned except under certain circumstances, such as national security, research, and non-professional uses.\n\nTransparency and accountability: High-risk applications must meet certain transparency, security, and quality requirements and undergo compliance testing.\n\nNew governing bodies: Four new bodies have been charged with enforcing the Act, though member states are required to set up their own authorities. These new bodies are the AI Office, the European Artificial Intelligence Board, the Advisory Forum, and the Scientific Panel of Independent Experts.\n\nAI Risk Categories\n\nWhat Is the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act?\n\nIn May 2024, Colorado enacted the nation’s first thorough piece of AI legislation. Scheduled to go into effect in February, 2026, the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act, or CAIA, will aim to protect consumers from biased treatment and “algorithmic discrimination” resulting from high-risk AI systems.\n\nA \"high-risk AI system\" is a system that can influence a person’s ability to access:\n\nEducation\n\nEmployment\n\nA financial or lending service\n\nGovernment services\n\nHealthcare services\n\nHousing\n\nInsurance\n\nLegal services\n\nAccording to CAIA, “algorithmic discrimination\" is when an AI system unfairly treats or negatively impacts a person or group of people based on factors like their age (or perceived age), race, gender, disability, national origin, religion, or other protected characteristics.\n\nUnder the act, deployers and developers of AI systems have certain responsibilities and must meet certain requirements. For example:\n\nDeployers of high-risk AI systems have to complete annual impact assessments.\n\nAI developers and deployers have to meet certain transparency requirements, such as making users aware that they are using AI systems.\n\nHow Do the EU AI and the Colorado AI Act Affect Data Privacy Laws?\n\nData privacy is still the purview of the GDPR, US, and international comprehensive privacy laws. The EU and Colorado AI Acts govern the development and use of AI technology, even if no personal information is being processed. That’s not to say that AI systems won't have to maintain compliance with both of the relevant AI and data privacy laws, but sometimes the GDPR and other privacy laws won't apply.\n\nWhile AI in and of itself is not automatically a consumer privacy issue, these two topics will intersect if your business uses, develops, or partners with AI, such as using generative AI or ChatGPT in your products or services.\n\nWhat Can Businesses Do to Get Ahead of AI?\n\nIf you develop or use AI in your business and you fall below the unacceptable risk category, what can your company do to make sure you're not only compliant but that you're also following business best practices and a set of ethical standards?\n\nStart with a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)\n\nThese impact assessments will help your company identify, evaluate, and mitigate privacy risks associated with processing someone’s data. They may also help your business categorize these risks, which you’ll need to comply with the AI Act.\n\nYou’ll have to conduct a PIA whenever you introduce a new product or feature or update an existing system to assess potential privacy risks. Key factors to evaluate include:\n\nHow personal data will be collected, used, shared, and stored\n\nThe categories of PI being handled\n\nWhy the information is being collected and handled\n\nWhat consumer expects for PI processing\n\nThe purpose, benefits, and potential negative impacts of data processing\n\nThe measures that will be put in place to address negative impacts\n\nAn assessment of whether the negative impacts outweigh the benefits\n\nHave Another Look at Your Third-Party Data Processing Agreements\n\nNow is the time to review your contracts with AI vendors and take a closer look at any clauses related to data, such as, data transfers, data processing, and internal practices. You may need to revisit their privacy and security practices and be prepared to take the next steps if the third parties aren’t compliant.\n\nEstablish a Legal Basis for Processing Data\n\nWhat’s the legal basis for processing someone’s data? For any data collection, usage, storage, or sharing under the GDPR and other data privacy laws,, you need a valid legal basis (and that applies to AI data collection, usage, storage, and sharing, too). These could include legitimate interest, contractual obligations, or user consent (the most common). While other state privacy laws don’t always list out the legal bases described in the GDPR, the same concepts broadly apply.\n\nGet User Consent\n\nUser consent is the shining star of information privacy regulations. Remember that your consumers need to understand what they’re consenting to and how their personal information will be used for AI (and any other purpose). They also have the right to remove their consent as well as access, change, and request that their sensitive information be deleted.\n\nExceptions apply only to anonymized data or when processing is required for legal obligations.\n\nMake Provisions to Protect Minors\n\nIf your organization processes children’s data, make sure their information is sufficiently protected. Keep in mind that age requirements differ from country to country and state to state, so be sure to check local regulations and always err on the side of caution to avoid potentially expensive fines.\n\nAdopt the Basic Principles of Information Privacy\n\nPurpose Limitation: Only collect data for a specific, legitimate purpose, which you must clearly define at the point of collection. The data you collect should only be used for the exact reason for which it was collected. If you plan on utilising user data for any other reason, you need consent.\n\nData Minimization: You should only collect, process, and store the very minimum amount of personal information you need to meet the purpose of the collection.\n\nManage AI Risks and Protect Data Privacy with Osano\n\nAlthough privacy and AI are distinct disciplines, we’re still only on the left-hand side of AI’s timeline. Having a solid privacy program will help future-proof your business against emerging AI innovation and regulation, while keeping your customer data protected. Prioritizing privacy today will pave the way for future AI success. Find out how Osano can help you harness the benefits of AI while maintaining data compliance.",

Poor air quality, particularly in areas with significant pollution, impairs respiratory function and physical endurance, potentially impacting both elite and amateur athletes. Promoting clean air initiatives through sporting events not only improves athletes’ well-being but also raises broader public awareness about the importance of environmental health.\n\n“Awareness is the first step. Managing waste effectively and adopting alternative technologies that reduce air pollution are crucial steps toward cleaner air,” said Osano.\n\nIntegrating air quality monitoring at events such as cross-country runs serves as a practical demonstration of environmental sustainability and diplomacy. This approach aligns sports with climate action and public health advocacy.\n\nThe air quality data collected over the next two months and three years will play a crucial role as Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania prepare to host the African Nations Championship in 2025 and the Africa Cup of Nations in 2027.",
      "# [How Osano Does DSARs](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/how-osano-does-dsars-7575645/)\nSubject rights requests can be confusing for everybody involved.\n\nSome consumers are savvy privacy advocates and expect their requests to be fulfilled to the letter. Others are just learning that they have subject rights and are testing the waters. Some consumers are even submitting vexatious requests, hunting for legally actionable information or hoping to gum up the works of a business they’re quarreling with.\n\nBusinesses are in a similar position. An email lands in your inbox, and suddenly the legal department says you’ve got 30 days to find every shred of personal information you have on this person. Even organizations that understand their legal obligations when fulfilling subject rights requests struggle with translating that abstract legal knowledge into on-the-ground operations.\n\nBut most businesses aren’t in the privacy industry—Osano is. And we like to think we’ve got a pretty good handle on our DSAR process.\n\nTo help clarify the confusion and give other organizations a blueprint for an effective DSAR process, we figured we’d describe our own workflow and how we think about subject rights requests.\n\nBut First: What Are DSARs or SRRs?\n\nEven though DSAR or data subject access request is a widely accepted blanket term for all subject rights in addition to access rights, we’ll use the term SRR or subject rights request in this article since it’s more accurate.\n\nData privacy regulations give data subjects (i.e., the person whose data you’re processing) a certain set of rights. These rights allow the data subject to make certain requests of organizations that are processing their data. We mentioned access rights, but data subjects can also request the deletion, correction, or summarization of their data, among other rights.\n\nMost data privacy laws provide similar rights, but there are exceptions.\n\nWe won’t dive too deep into SRR 101 here. If you want to learn more about the basics behind subject rights, you can find more information in our blog, What Is a DSAR?\n\nThe important things to know about SRRs for the purposes of this article are:\n\nThere’s a time limit. SRR responses are generally (but not always) due within 30 or 45 days depending on the governing law.\n\nSRRs can be easier or harder to fulfill depending on a variety of factors. Request type, your organization’s systems, the vendors you use, the volume of requests you receive—each of these influences how much time and effort goes into fulfilling an SRR.\n\nSRRs are on the rise. In the EU, where data privacy rights are more widely understood, there are already thousands of SRRs being made each day. In the US, that figure is smaller. But in both jurisdictions and worldwide, SRRs are on the rise.\n\nOrganizations’ SRR Processes Will Vary\n\nYou can think of SRRs a bit like shoes.\n\nEach person has a different size shoe, some people wear boots more often than dress shoes, and if you watch a crowd of people walking about, you’ll notice they’re each wearing something different.\n\nSRR processes are a lot like that. Some organizations will have more or less volume and complexity, see certain request types from certain jurisdictions more often than others, and so on.\n\nWhile one pair of shoes may differ from another, they’re still recognizable as a pair of shoes. They come in sets of left and right and have soles and laces. So, while there will be differences among SRR processes, there will also be some consistent features that ensure your organization is protected—just like a good pair of shoes protects your feet.\n\nHere are some factors unique to Osano that impact our SRR process:\n\nWe’re in the data privacy industry. As a result, we see more SRRs than other businesses of a comparable size.\n\nWe’re a small business. While we receive a sizeable number of SRRs, we still only have so much headcount and time available to our personnel. Osanians are scrappy, wear a lot of hats, and work hard to support our customers’ compliance. This means we have to be extra efficient when fulfilling SRRs.\n\nWe comply with laws we don’t technically have to. As a privacy-forward business, we believe it’s best to provide all of our audience with subject rights, even if they aren’t protected by a data privacy regulation in their jurisdiction.\n\nWe use Osano to manage SRRs. How could we sell an SRR management solution if we didn’t? The Osano platform is our secret sauce to gaining the efficiency needed to handle the SRR volume we see despite the scale of our company.\n\nHow Osano Does SRRs: Our Process\n\n1. Accept Request\n\nWe have a few ways for data subjects to submit their requests.\n\nMost data privacy laws require at least two methods for request submission—commonly, email or a toll-free phone number. We provide an email address and a physical mailing address, but the primary way we receive requests is through our forms.\n\nThe Osano platform enables us to embed subject rights request forms in our webpages, as well as in our “cookie drawer”—an Osano-powered widget that allows website visitors to update their cookie preferences and submit an SRR if they so desire. We call the latter our One-Click DSAR functionality. Submitting via form is the primary way data subjects submit SRRs to the Osano team.\n\nHere's what our DSAR Form page looks like:\n\nNavigating to our SRR submission page gives the visitor several request types. Clicking on one of these options opens up a form with fields specific to that request type.\n\nUsing a form to guide data subjects through the request process has some significant benefits for us. For example, we can require data subjects to provide needed information for us to action the request. If a data subject were to submit a correction request via email, they might not include information like what they want corrected or where they’re seeing the incorrect information. If that were to happen, we’d have to email the data subject back and forth—all while we’re handling other SRRs and that 30- or 45-day deadline is ticking.\n\nWith a form, we can (and do) ask data subjects to provide this information before submitting. This way, we know that once a request is verified, we can get straight to work on it.\n\nAnother interesting aspect about our forms—we offer every subject right universally (some of which are accessible through our “Other” request option), but if we didn’t, Osano allows us to automatically offer request types based on the data subject’s jurisdiction.\n\nFor example, Oregon provides data subjects with the right to know a list of the specific third parties that have received their personal data. Most privacy laws don’t provide this right. Using Osano, only Oregonians would receive this right by default. If you want to offer that right to everyone, you can do so with Osano. Or, if you want to offer that right to some people outside of Oregon or provide any other mix of data subject rights, you can do that too. The only thing you can’t do is not offer a required right for a given jurisdiction.\n\n2. Verify Request\n\nBecause we don’t handle particularly sensitive data at Osano, we use the data subject’s name and email address to verify their identity. Some companies might choose to use a more thorough means of verification, such as receiving a scan of the data subject’s driver’s license. This is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it’s a better fraud prevention technique. On the other, it adds yet more personal data to manage—in the case of a driver’s license, many laws would construe that as sensitive data to boot.\n\nWhen a request is received, the Osano platform sends an email with a magic link to the provided address. Clicking on the link both verifies the data subject’s identity and brings the requestor to an Osano-powered secure messaging portal, where the data subject can communicate with whoever is actioning the SRR.\n\n3. Check Whether There Is Relevant Data\n\nOsano automatically searches our systems for data corresponding to the request. If there’s still no data connected to the request, then we let the data subject know there’s no data for us to action on, and we can end the process there.\n\nOsano can search through our systems because we use another Osano module to facilitate SRRs—our data mapping functionality. Any system connected to our single-sign-on (SSO) provider is discoverable to Osano, enabling us to search through systems for a data subject’s information automatically. We use our SSO to connect to systems, but Osano also connects to customer data platforms (CDPs) like Segment or RudderStack and cloud database services like Amazon Aurora RDS. Individual data stores that aren’t connected to sources like an SSO, CDP, or cloud database can be added manually as well.\n\nAn example data map in Osano.\n\n4. Assign Action Items Based on Request\n\nEach request type has a different workflow.\n\nSummary and deletion requests are both the most common request types, and the most straightforward. Osano automatically processes these requests but keeps a human in the loop for verification. Again, this automation is possible because we also use Osano for data mapping.\n\nTransfer/portability requests function similarly but require the data to be packaged up and sent to the data subject.\n\nOpt-out requests are also executed automatically and instantaneously upon data subjects’ identity verification. This is one way of honoring requirements like the CCPA’s Do-Not-Sell/-Share request. Upon receiving this request, Osano turns off any cookies and data-tracking scripts on the website for the requestor. If we sold or shared consumer data through other means (we don’t), then Osano would also exempt the data subjects’ personal information from such transfers.\n\nCorrection requests require more manual effort, since there are lots of different kinds of information that might need correcting. Depending on the information that needs correcting, an administrator of the Osano platform assigns an action item to a data store owner to make the necessary correction. The assignee then receives notifications and alerts if the request deadline is approaching.\n\nWe also offer generic “Other” requests. Naturally, these may require more manual effort and review. They aren’t required by law, but we like to offer them to be privacy-forward for our audience. They also serve as a catch-all for unenumerated rights. Some laws use different terms for functionally the same request type, so the “Other” category lets data subjects submit rights requests offered elsewhere but described in unfamiliar terms.\n\nThere are other SRR types—we mentioned Oregon’s right to know about third parties receiving data subject’s information, for example—but these can often be met through request types like those we described above or by adding additional information in the organization’s various policies and notices.\n\n5. Communicate with the Data Subject\n\nBecause we use a form to guide our SRR workflow, we usually don’t need to engage in too much back and forth with the data subject. Osano also provides a secure messaging portal, ensuring that our conversations are private and preventing the spread of yet more personal information in email clients. Osano also provides prepopulated template emails to communicate with data subjects. It may not seem like much, but it’s a lot easier than having to write bespoke emails each time, especially as your SRR volume ramps up.\n\n6. Keep Records\n\nMany data privacy regulations require you to keep records of your SRRs, generally for a period of two years. Osano automatically keeps our SRR records for us.\n\nHow Much Time Do We Save Using Osano?\n\nWe’ve never not used Osano, so this figure is difficult to quantify. However, we can make an estimate by looking at where and how Osano saves time versus manual SRR fulfillment:\n\nStreamlined data subject communication: We don’t have to go back and forth with data subjects to get them to elaborate their request; our form prompts them for all the info we need. Plus, our email templates make it easy to respond to SRRs at scale, and we know that all of our SRR communications can be found in Osano’s secure messaging portal.\n\nAutomated data discovery: We don’t have to look up data subject’s information manually; Osano does it for us using our data map.\n\nAutomated SRR fulfillment: We don’t have to manually delete each row in each record, or copy and paste each piece of data, or summarize the data types; Osano does it for us—but we make sure to keep a human in the loop for verification.\n\nAutomated recordkeeping: We don’t have to fill out a spreadsheet with metadata whenever we receive a request; Osano does it for us.\n\nKeeping all of this in mind, one of our privacy pros estimated that Osano saves them 10x the effort it would take to process SRRs manually.

Two months later, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT), testified before Congress on AI risks and urged stronger AI regulations . While lawmakers and technology stakeholders go back and forth on how much regulation to impose and the form it will take, everyone agrees on one thing: AI governance is important, and a complete lack of it could have major consequences, from the violation of privacy rights to unethical business practices. What does AI governance entail, and how does it affect you? Let’s find out. But first… What Is AI Governance? Artificial intelligence technology is widely used in a variety of applications and industries to automate tasks, analyze data, and predict outcomes. AI can save time, lower costs, and even reduce errors introduced by manual work. But as we hand over tasks and decisions to AI, it’s necessary to ensure that its use meets ethical standards, complies with regulations, and upholds user privacy. AI governance is the combined framework of processes, principles, and policies that guide the development and deployment of ethical and responsible AI systems. It ensures these systems are transparent, explainable, and accountable. It also provides guidelines to minimize risks and create AI models that are free of biases and errors that could be harmful to people. To understand why AI governance is necessary, we must look at how AI models are created and trained and how data privacy issues could arise. AI Model Training and How It Relies on Data How does AI gain the capability to give answers, complete tasks, and make decisions? First, AI models need to be trained with significant volumes of data. They take that input data and correlate the output to match a sample output (for example, a photo with certain edges, shapes, colors, and similar characteristics = a photo of a dog). The training enables a model to generalize from data it has seen to label and make predictions about unseen data. How much data do you need to train an AI model? It depends. Large language models (LLMs; like Chat GPT) use billions of data points and numerous parameters. However, smaller models may need only thousands or even hundreds of data points, depending on the scope of the use case. Like people, an AI model’s learning relies on the three Vs for a well-rounded education: volume, variety, and velocity. Volume, because the more information they have access to, the more comprehensive their knowledge of the subject. Variety, because different types of information help them develop a more nuanced understanding of the topic. Velocity, because the more quickly information is generated, processed, and analyzed, the better the model becomes at fast, real-time decision-making. Fun story: When visual CAPTCHA tests came out, people said it was just to teach Google robots what those images were. Why? Because CAPTCHAs ask humans to click on a bunch of images that contain, say, motorbikes. An artificial mind then looks at the results and learns what a motorbike (or traffic lights, or dachshunds, or trees) looks like: seeing inputs and outputs over and over until they can replicate it. But there are more efficient ways to train robots. A limitation of AI is that it’s only as good or accurate as the data it’s been trained on. It can provide information based on that data, but the output isn’t a “thought” as would be the case with a human brain. However, AI is evolving quickly, and the quality and sophistication of its outputs based on its inputs is improving. One of the issues with providing AI models with training data is that it raises certain risks–particularly around data privacy . The vast quantities of data used in LLMs, for example, exacerbate the problem because it’s harder to track data and spot the risks. Data Privacy Risks in AI Training Training Data Issues In most cases, AI models are trained on information from existing databases or from the Internet. The biggest privacy risk is that some of that data may be personal, identifiable, or sensitive. If the data subject hasn’t consented to their data being used for AI training (and they probably haven’t), you may be acting unethically and non-compliantly. Issue 1: The Subject Did Not Provide Informed Consent One of the requirements of data privacy laws is that organizations may only collect consumers’ personal data with their informed consent. The “informed” part includes conveying the purpose for which it’s being collected. Issue 2: The Subject Did Not Provide Informed Consent for All Uses If someone is okay with their personal information being used for purpose A but not purpose B, you must respect that preference under laws like the GDPR and the CCPA. For example, a consumer may have consented to having their social media data used for targeted advertising purposes, but not for having that data scraped and incorporated into an AI training set. Issue 3: Breach of Privacy by Using Personal Data in Responses Using people’s personal information to train LLMs comes with another risk: the models might disclose this information as part of their response. If John Doe’s address and phone number were included in the training data for ChatGPT, what’s stopping it from giving this information out if someone asks? Granted, if you follow data privacy best practices, this data would have been stripped of any identifiers. However, the problem typically occurs when model trainers are unaware of privacy law, or they use personal data without realizing it. So, the three concerns about training data are: There might be consumers’ personal data mixed in with the training data; The consumers might not have consented to their personal data being used for AI model training, and; The AI tool might disclose people’s personal data in its responses. All are avoidable if privacy professionals are involved with establishing AI governance and making those risks clear. Bias and Discrimination Risks When people first realized the power of computers, it was easy to think of them as omniscient and powerful. But in reality, computers are machines, and as such, their outputs are only as reliable as the inputs they have to work with. This is commonly expressed as “Garbage In, Garbage Out,” or GIGO. GIGO has always been true and is still true with AI models. Their results are only as good (or terrible) as the material they are trained on. One example of the risk of AI and GIGO is Microsoft’s Tay chatbot . This chatbot was supposed to learn from live interactions on Twitter. However, users decided to feed it vulgar language and antisocial interactions. A few short hours after launch, Tay was mimicking this undesirable behavior and the chatbot had to be disabled. GIGO, happening in real life and real time. That’s an extreme example of the risk of AI- and user-generated content: Users and society are biased, and AI models can pick up and internalize inherent biases and prejudices. Some example biases are: Training data biases, which occur when the data used to train an AI model is skewed in favor of or underrepresents a certain group. Algorithmic biases, caused by programming errors or decisions where the developer introduces logic that reflects their own prejudices. Cognitive biases, that could be introduced unwittingly by developers when their training data is weighted or selected according to their own preferences. If a model picks up these biases and then is used to make certain decisions, it will not provide accurate results. For example, medical research over the years has been primarily conducted on Caucasians, with other groups underrepresented. If data from these trials were to be used to train AI to make medical decisions, it could produce inaccurate diagnoses for patients in underrepresented groups. That could have dangerous, even fatal, outcomes. Similarly, AI bias could lead to discriminatory hiring decisions. Amazon had to stop using its AI hiring tool when it became clear that the tool favored men over women. At one point, Google Ads showed listings for high-paying executive positions to men more often than women. It’s been shown that predictive policing tools can be biased toward people who look a certain way, dress a certain way, or even walk a certain way. These are just a few examples of how such biases can affect predictive AI results. and negatively impact real people's lives. The Risk of Inferences and Predictions As Osano CEO Arlo Gilbert explained in his book, The Privacy Insider , one piece of personal information in an AI model may not do harm. But combine several pieces of information together and predict outcomes based on assumptions, and things can go really wrong. People often think they have nothing to hide because one bit of information is harmless. But multiple pieces of information contextualized by AI? Then the risk gets real. For example, AI could piece together seemingly unrelated information like your location, purchases, and date and time stamps and incorrectly deduce (with the help of inherent bias) that you committed a crime. Or use non-personal information to make inferences about your medical condition, religion, or sexual orientation that are untrue or that you don’t want disclosed. Because of this possibility, it’s critical to have AI governance and policies in place to ensure that AI is used ethically and in a non-invasive way. Risks Associated with Lack of Transparency We’ve touched upon consent earlier in regard to training data. Let’s say you want to get user consent before you use their personal data to train AI models. Informed consent requires complete clarity on why the information is needed, how it’ll be used, and whether it’s being processed lawfully. This is the foundation of every privacy law. Model training is a form of data processing. If the data subject isn’t clear about what their data is being used for, they can’t give informed consent. If the data subject can’t give informed consent, you are crossing the line of ethical data practices–and breaking every privacy law in existence. And, unlike other methods of processing data, it is not so easy to undo data processing in an AI model and cure the violation. Not getting informed consent will cost you money. But just as important, it will cost you trust, which may be more damaging in the long run. Violation of Data Minimization Principles According to the principles of privacy by design , only the minimum amount of information required for a given purpose should be collected to protect the identity and privacy of individuals and to reduce the burden of protecting and managing that data. This principle is now enshrined in several state data privacy laws, including the Maryland Online Data Privacy Act , which has strict requirements and penalties associated with data minimization. However, we’ve also seen how volume is a benefit when it comes to training AI. If gathering more data benefits a company training its own AI model, why would it want to limit its collection? Unfortunately, indiscriminate data collection can impact consumer privacy, which is why AI governance is needed. AI Governance Frameworks and Laws The United States made an early attempt to define an AI framework when it was clear generative AI tools would be gaining wider usage. The country’s first executive order on AI, issued in late 2023, focused on the safe, secure, and trustworthy development of AI. While it’s since been repealed and replaced by the Trump administration, the order’s eight guiding principles and priorities are representative of other frameworks meant to advance and govern the development and use of AI. AI must be safe and secure. It should promote innovation, collaboration, and competition. It should not have a harmful effect on jobs and workplaces for human workers. It should advance equity and civil rights. It should protect consumers, patients, and students. It should not compromise consumer privacy. It should be deployed responsibly by the government. It should be developed internationally through the implementation of vital standards in partnership with other governments. However, as of now, there is no federal AI law on the books in the U.S. However, a few states, like Colorado, passed AI laws over the past two years that could serve as a blueprint for future laws here. The EU AI Act and Risk Categories Meanwhile, the European Union’s EU AI Act came into force in August 2024. The law categorizes AI models by the risk they pose to determine what level of governance they need and includes a category for unacceptable risk. This act aligns with the GDPR to protect consumer privacy and encourage transparency in AI model development. Like the data privacy regulation, this act applies to AI systems built inside the EU, but its impact also extends outside EU boundaries to include systems that target or serve EU residents. While the EU AI Act allows developers to determine the risk category of their AI model themselves, they will be held liable if a court finds it’s determined that they miscategorized it. The four categories of risk under the EU AI Act are as follows: Minimal or no risk: These are low-stakes AI systems like spam filters, AI used in video games, or AI-powered recommendation systems for streaming services that pose negligible harm to individuals or society. These systems are subject to minimal governance requirements and aren’t heavily regulated. Limited risk: These are systems that pose a moderate risk as they have some level of interaction with users or provide inputs that influence their decisions, like AI chatbots, virtual assistants, or systems for dynamic website content creation. They require minimal transparency measures—including disclosing to users that they are interacting with AI—as their outputs don’t affect areas like safety, well-being, or fundamental rights. High-risk: Systems that can have an impact on people’s well-being, safety, or fundamental rights are classified as high-risk. These include AI in healthcare, autonomous vehicles, systems that grade or determine access to education, recruitment or performance evaluation systems (both in the workplace and other settings), and public services. These systems can significantly affect people’s lives and potentially cause harm. Therefore, they require more stringent governance, including continuous assessment of risk, data governance, transparency, accountability, robustness, accuracy, and human oversight. Unacceptable risk: These systems violate the fundamental rights of individuals and, as such, are not allowed under the EU AI Act. Examples of systems that are banned outright include those that manipulate human behavior to impact their free will, exploit vulnerabilities of a specific group of people, and those use untargeted scraping of facial data for facial recognition databases, etc. Other AI Frameworks: NIST, ISO, and the OECD In July 2024, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released the Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework to guide the practical application of the principles in President Biden’s executive order. Organizations can use the NIST framework to “improve the ability to incorporate trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and evaluation of AI products, services, and systems.” Though it is a voluntary framework, it is considered a defining framework for AI governance best practices. The ISO 42001 framework is a standard that provides guidelines for AI management systems. It helps organizations govern, deploy, and monitor AI in a responsible manner. Its benefit is that it integrates into existing processes and systems. As a result, you don’t have to build AI governance from scratch. You can simply adapt your current framework to include AI. In 2024, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) updated its principles for trustworthy AI , originally drafted in 2019, and updated them in 2024. These are: Inclusive growth, sustainable development, and well-being Human rights and democratic values, including fairness and privacy Transparency and explainability Invest in AI research and innovation to promote trustworthy AI systems. Foster an inclusive AI-enabling ecosystem. Shape an enabling policy environment to support AI adoption while managing risks. Build human capacity and prepare the workforce for changes brought by AI. Cooperate across borders to align global efforts for trustworthy AI governance. Levels of AI Governance Because of its sensitive nature, AI governance should operate at different levels from global to company-specific operations. Each layer should address the appropriate aspects of regulations, oversight, and ethical management. Here are the various levels of AI governance: Global Governance This is an international set of guidelines to help manage cross-border risks like cybersecurity, bias, and human rights violations. Global governance can also help foster cooperation between countries, which can lead to improved AI research and innovation. National Governance Country-specific regulations and policies for governing AI help align research and development with national priorities. These also ensure compliance with local privacy and anti-discrimination laws. Industry-Specific Governance Different industries use AI in different ways, and some of them pose higher risks than others. That’s why it’s important to develop industry-specific standards and guidelines, especially for critical, high-risk verticals like healthcare, finance, recruitment, and transport technology. Technical Governance Guidelines, protocols, and standards like ISO/IEC help developers create and operate safe and ethical AI systems. These regulate areas like algorithmic fairness, security-rich, privacy-preserving data practices, and transparency of AI models. Organizational Governance Just like a public-facing privacy policy articulates how a company collects, stores, processes, and uses the personal and sensitive information of consumers, organizations should also have internal policies and processes for the development and use of AI systems. An internal policy ensures that teams across the organization clearly understand and follow ethical AI practices and relevant AI regulations as they build and deploy AI technologies, or use data with AI tools. The internal policy provides mechanisms for oversight and accountability so transparency, security, and data privacy requirements are met. Organizations should also educate and empower users to make informed decisions about how to interact with and use AI. For consumers to have the most control over how to interact with AI, they need to also have control over their data and a thorough understanding of their privacy rights. To that end, they must be informed of AI risks for truly informed consent. Finally, they must be made aware of their rights under AI regulations. Good Privacy Practices Mean Better AI Governance Building a strong data privacy foundation for your business can expedite and simplify the creation of an AI governance program. A strong privacy management platform like Osano can help lay the foundation for broader AI governance by helping you: Clearly craft and articulate internal and external policies and make them visible to regulators and stakeholders. These frameworks can serve as a blueprint for crafting other governance policies. Discover and track data throughout your organization to understand where and how personal and sensitive data is being used, including in AI tools and projects. Understand how third parties manage data, including in the context of AI. Clearly communicate with others across the organization to align on AI usage and risk management. Once you have clear policies on personal and sensitive data, know where it resides in the organization and how it’s used, and gain visibility into operations and risks, you can better protect personal and sensitive data in every situation. And better privacy governance translates to better AI governance."
