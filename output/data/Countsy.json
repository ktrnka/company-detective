      "# [5 Essential Skills for Every Leader — Countsy by Lee Bellon on 2024-08-15](https://www.countsy.com/insights/5-essential-skills-for-every-leader)\nLeadership is more than managing people and tasks. It's about inspiring teams to achieve extraordinary results. Effective leadership is a blend of innate capabilities and learned skills that are essential to a company’s success. This post outlines five core skills to elevate your leadership game.\n\n1. Emotional Intelligence: The Heart of Leadership\n\nEmotional intelligence (EQ) is often overlooked in favor of traditional measures of intelligence like IQ. However, research has shown that EQ is a more accurate predictor of leadership success. It encompasses the ability to understand and manage one's own emotions, as well as perceive and respond to the emotional states of others.\n\nLeaders with high EQ excel at navigating complex interpersonal dynamics. Their capacity to remain composed under pressure enables sound decision-making and builds credibility and trust.\n\nKey components of emotional intelligence include:\n\nSelf-awareness: understanding your emotions, strengths, weaknesses, and values.\n\nSelf-regulation: managing emotions effectively.\n\nEmpathy: recognizing and navigating the feelings of others.\n\nSocial skills: building and maintaining relationships.\n\n2. Clear Communication: The Language of Leadership\n\nEffective communication is the lifeblood of any organization, not just at the leadership level. Leaders who model open, productive communication and constructive conflict inspire trust and confidence.\n\nGreat leaders are also skilled listeners. They actively seek out feedback, understand and value different perspectives, and respond thoughtfully.\n\nKey elements of effective communication include:\n\nClarity: Ensuring messages are clear, concise, understandable, and authentic.\n\nActive listening: Giving full attention to the speaker and understanding their perspective. Listen to understand versus listening to respond.\n\nEmpathy: Communicating with understanding and compassion.\n\nAdaptability: Tailoring communication style to different audiences and situations.\n\n3. Delegation and Empowerment: Unleashing Potential\n\nDelegation is more than just offloading your tasks onto others. By entrusting your team with more complex and impactful tasks, leaders create opportunities for growth and creative problem solving. This approach not only frees you up to focus on more strategic initiatives but also fosters a culture of empowerment, ownership, and engagement within the team.\n\nEffective delegation is a deliberate process of:\n\nIdentifying tasks to offload without compromising quality.\n\nSelecting the right individuals based on their skills and interests.\n\nProviding clear expectations and deadlines\n\nOffering necessary support to ensure success\n\n4. Fostering a Culture of Trust: The Foundation of Leadership\n\nTrust is the foundation of all high-performing teams. It serves as the bedrock upon which collaboration, innovation, and loyalty are built. A culture of trust creates a safe work environment for employees to voice their opinions, take risks, and engage in necessary, healthy debate.\n\nKey strategies for building trust include:\n\nLeading by example: Demonstrate the behaviors and values you expect from your team - integrity, transparency, respect, and accountability.\n\nOpen communication: Encourage open dialogue and debate, active listening, and continuous feedback.\n\nEmpowering employees: Trust is a reciprocal relationship. Give your team the autonomy and support they need to thrive and succeed.\n\n5. Defining a Vision and Strategic Plan: Charting the Course\n\nVisionary and strategic planning are the compass to an organization's future success. A clear vision provides direction and inspires teams, but without the ability to define a strategic roadmap and clear goals, a vision is just a lofty idea.\n\nTo develop a compelling vision, leaders must:\n\nUnderstand the organization's core values and purpose.\n\nAnalyze the competitive landscape and industry trends.\n\nEnvision a desired future state.\n\nCommunicate the vision clearly and passionately.\n\nDefine the strategy for moving toward the ultimate vision - set clear goals to ensure alignment.\n\nBy mastering these five essential competencies, you can elevate your leadership skills. Remember, becoming a great leader is a journey, not a destination. Continuous learning and development are essential to being a truly impactful leader.",
      "# [5 Management Tips to Avoid Discrimination — Countsy by Lee Bellon on 2024-09-15](https://www.countsy.com/insights/5-management-tips-to-avoid-discrimination)\nAs a manager, you have hopefully completed Harassment and Discrimination Prevention Training, and you know that not only is discrimination in the workplace illegal, but it also creates a toxic, unproductive work culture. Creating an inclusive work culture requires a commitment to fairness and equity. To prevent discrimination in the workplace, here are 5 tips all managers should follow:\n\n1. Be Fair and Consistent\n\nManagers must treat all employees equitably, applying policies and practices consistently. Treat all employees with respect and impartiality, regardless of their age, gender, race, religion, or other protected characteristics.\n\nMake sure you apply rules, expectations, and performance standards equally to every employee. Define clear eligibility reasons for company benefits and rewards and apply them consistently throughout the organization. Consistency and fairness in your actions builds a culture of trust and prevents perceptions of favoritism.\n\n2. Make Performance-Based Decisions\n\nAll employment decisions, from hiring to termination, should be based on objective performance metrics. Relying on subjective criteria can introduce unconscious bias, and lead to discriminatory decision making, whether intentional or unintentional.\n\nAvoid making assumptions or stereotypes about employees. Instead, focus on measurable results and work-related behaviors. By prioritizing performance, you reduce the risk of discrimination claims and create a fair workplace where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed.\n\n3. Have a Legitimate Business Reason\n\nAny decision that impacts employees such as disciplinary action, termination of employment, and even promotions, should be justified by clear and legitimate business reasons. These reasons should be documented and defensible. For example, if you need to reduce headcount, make your selection criteria based on business needs such as reducing costs, shutting down a specific location, or eliminating job redundancy - not on age, family status, gender, or other non-job-related reason.\n\nEven if you are an At-Will employer, making termination decisions without a justifiable business reason puts the company at risk for a potential discrimination claim.\n\n4. Document Everything, Good and Bad\n\nKeeping good performance notes should be a practice that managers at all levels should adopt and commit to. Keep notes on both positive and negative performance, as well as any disciplinary actions taken, and any verbal coaching you have provided. This documentation can serve as evidence of fair, performance-based treatment and can help mitigate potential legal risks.\n\nBe factual, and objective in your documentation. Cite specific examples of performance issues and get in the habit of dating your notes so you can show how long you have been trying to coach your employee on their job performance.\n\nBy maintaining thorough documentation, you can demonstrate that your decisions are based on performance and not discriminatory motives.\n\n5. Involve HR Early\n\nInvolving HR early in performance issues and involuntary terminations can help protect you and your organization. A good HR partner can provide guidance on how to create fair and inclusive work practices, how to avoid legal missteps when it comes to employment decisions, and they can help develop a specific plan to manage performance issues when they arise.\n\nRemember, fair and consistent management practices and making performance-based employment decisions are not only key when it comes to avoiding discrimination in the workplace, but it also helps create a more positive, transparent, and inclusive workplace.\n\nDisclaimer: This blog post is intended to provide general information and does not constitute legal advice. It is essential to consult with legal counsel for specific guidance on employment law."

If it peels too early it will be raw underneath like ripping off a fresh scab, so I have to go around looking like my infected nose is about to fall off for about a week till the skin sloughs off naturally. To avoid any of this I wear 110 spf and apply every 20-30 mins. In tropical climates I can literally not be out in the sun during midday cause all I'm doing is reapplying sunblock the entire time. Me and the sun are not friends.\n\n#### Comment ID d2hm64r with +4 score by [(raz_MAH_taz, Reddit, 2016-04-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/4ggi9t/never_knew_a_sunburn_could_cause_this/d2hm64r/) (in reply to ID d2hej0k):\nWell, that's because you are phenotypically better equipped to handle long days in the sun.\n\n#### Comment ID d2hy0k6 with +2 score by [(SourCreamWater, Reddit, 2016-04-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/4ggi9t/never_knew_a_sunburn_could_cause_this/d2hy0k6/) (in reply to ID d2hej0k):\nI get sunburned, but I've never gotten swollen like this.\n\n#### Comment ID d2hnrb9 with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2016-04-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/4ggi9t/never_knew_a_sunburn_could_cause_this/d2hnrb9/) (in reply to ID d2hej0k):\nI've known black people that burn just as well as the more sun-hearty white folks (red skin, even if you have to get *way* close to see the change in color.  The people I grew up with were very dark).  His reaction isn't typical, however.  My older brother tans a bit, but actually had a similar reaction (he almost couldn't open his eyes), except he had a hard layer of damaged, peeling skin over it.  I've been in the same exact conditions, at the same age, without the same reaction, and I'm fairer-skinned than he is (I go white to red, and maybe the very slight tan is visible if the sunburn goes away fast enough giving me a very slightly orange hue, he half tans half burns, and looks tanned when he's outside).  He never had this before or since, and has been burned worse.\n\nSo, yeah, it's not common, and I can't even guess what conditions caused it to happen to him that one time.\n\n#### Comment ID d2i93oe with +1 score by [(AaronSF, Reddit, 2016-04-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/4ggi9t/never_knew_a_sunburn_could_cause_this/d2i93oe/) (in reply to ID d2hej0k):\nI'm very white, and I wilt in the sun/dehydrate quickly; but I've been out in the desert in 113 degree weather without sun-screen and been fine. I think being close to a pool and air-conditioned room help a bit. I tan but not very deeply.\n\n#### Comment ID d2idfez with +1 score by [(ked_man, Reddit, 2016-04-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/4ggi9t/never_knew_a_sunburn_could_cause_this/d2idfez/) (in reply to ID d2hej0k):\nNot like OP's photo, but yes, us paler white people it's even worse.  I don't \"tan\" so to speak.  I burn, then peel, then back to white.  My arms get a little color during the summer, but it's basically a reddish tint the whole time.  \n\nI wear long sleeved shirts and hats at all times in the summer.  Often wear pants as well and if I wear anything less than 30 spf I will burn in no time.  \n\nWhen I was about 13 I wore sandals to the lake fishing, with pants and a long sleeved shirt.  It was still fairly chilly outside so NBD. Didn't put on sun screen.   The tops of my feet got so sunburned that I had to be treated with burn creams.  And between the swelling, like in OP's photo, and the gauze used to wrap my blistered feet, I couldn't wear shoes.  So I wore these God awful booties that are meant to go on a foot with a cast.  So they were designed like a bucket with a strap and a foam pad on the bottom.  I wore those to school for about two weeks, it sucked.\n\n#### Comment ID d2hfca5 with +1 score by [(darkgothvamptress, Reddit, 2016-04-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/4ggi9t/never_knew_a_sunburn_could_cause_this/d2hfca5/) (in reply to ID d2hej0k):\nI'm white as hell. I always burn within a few hours, blisters if longer. I tan, then sometimes peel. I treat my skin with a scalding hot shower and tons of aloe and it's seems to just go tan and not peel. Then tanned skin is harder to burn. It's still best to wear suntan lotion no matter the skin pigment.\n\n#### Comment ID d2hm1i8 with +1 score by [(chokingonlego, Reddit, 2016-04-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/4ggi9t/never_knew_a_sunburn_could_cause_this/d2hm1i8/) (in reply to ID d2hej0k):\nNot all of them. I'm white, and I don't blister or swell up like this. Stick me outside surrounded by the sun for 12 hours and my skin is red as a lobster and peels, though. Guess I'm lucky in that regard.\n\n#### Comment ID d2hox02 with +1 score by [(g-a-r-n-e-t, Reddit, 2016-04-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/4ggi9t/never_knew_a_sunburn_could_cause_this/d2hox02/) (in reply to ID d2hej0k):\nI had this happen, but I had just started a medicine that made me sun-sensitive (which I had never been before; usually I got a little pink the first time and then tanned after that) and forgot to put on sunblock for ten hours on a lake in 95-degree Texas heat. I ended up vomiting that entire night and running a fever and spent the next few days in bed because I literally could not do anything without being in excruciating pain. \n\nAfter about a week it subsided and literally all of my skin that was burned turned into this hard shiny scab that cracked and fell off in huge flakes when I moved. I refused to go to my first two days of classes that semester because it was so bad.\n\n#### Comment ID d2hp3gf with +1 score by [(arlenroy, Reddit, 2016-04-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/4ggi9t/never_knew_a_sunburn_could_cause_this/d2hp3gf/) (in reply to ID d2hej0k):\nI had worked with a guy this happened to, he would legit get sun poisoning.

It doesn't look like a sunburn at all. Histamine causes capillaries to become leaky which leads to this condition. Try taking a Benadryl. If it clears up then it's an allergic reaction.

They'll be beat red and hot. All the blood is rushing to the surface of their skin as it's having a nasty reaction to the sun which makes them feel more hot.

It's caused by a spore-producing bacteria found in many soil and animal feces.  It's not really the bacteria you have to worry about since it dies almost immediately when exposed to oxygen.  However, the spores are extremely resistant to oxygen and heat.  The toxin released by the bacteria spores is what causes the neurological symptoms.\n\nIt's not that rust carries the spores, it's that the pitted surface of rusted metal provides an adequate place for dirt and spores to be lodged.  When a passer-by scrapes themselves on the rusted metal, the spores are transferred into the wound and the toxin is released into the nervous system.  The reason why it's associated with rusty metal dates back to the hay-day of the toxin which afflicted many rural families.  Since open wounds are really the only danger with the toxin, anything dirty and sharp on a farm would present a danger.  What's dirtier and sharper than jagged rusty metal?  Probably a knife, but the knife would likely not be harboring spores due to it's smoothness and lack of exposure to soil; even if it did carry spores, would be washed regularly enough to eliminate the danger.\n\n\nRusted and corroded metal provides, not just a pitted surface for harboring the spores, but also jabbed edges to cut the skin open.  But really, any sharp and rough outdoor object, especially in rural areas with a lot of livestock, can carry the spores.  Similarly, you are unlikely to find the spores on indoor surfaces in major cities that have never been exposed to soil, especially if they are clean surfaces.\n\nTL;DR - Tetanus is caused by a spore-bearing bacteria that lodges in the pits of the rusted metal and is not a result of being cut by the rusted itself.\n\n### Comment ID dcel2u5 with +1 score by [(dewse, Reddit, 2017-01-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/5nan5y/the_disgusting_razor_my_dad_uses_to_shave_im/dcel2u5/) (in reply to ID dcantnu):\nCame here to say the same.

He would do stuff like take out the garbage, dump the contents of the garbage bag into the community dumpster then take the bag back in for reuse again and again.\nHe obsessed about the cost of everything, after moving in with my mother she started telling him everything, from a meal out to his medication, cost five dollars, and managed his money for him.\nA deception, yes, but a kind one.

      "# [RGP Makes Unexpected Move to Dallas by Sonia Chung on 2024-11-04](https://www.ocbj.com/media/rgp-makes-unexpected-move-to-dallas/)\nResources Connection Inc., a provider of workers for human resources, finance and technology, unexpectedly moved its headquarters out of state after almost 30 years in Orange County, effective Nov. 1.\n\n“Texas offers a more central location for RGP to provide service and support to clients around the world,” a spokesperson for the company, commonly known as RGP, told the Business Journal. “The timing is aligned.”\n\nThe company in August sold its Irvine headquarters and entered into a lease for another Irvine office “to replace the recently sold Irvine office building,” according to its quarterly report filed last month with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That Irvine lease for $700,000 a year was scheduled to start Nov. 1 and expire in 2032.\n\nThe company has run into headwinds in recent years that have forced it to restructure.\n\nSales at the company fell 18% to $632.8 million in fiscal 2024 and analysts are projecting a 6.3% drop this fiscal year to $592.8 million. Chief Executive Kate Duchene attributed the decline to an economic slowdown.\n\nIts shares have dropped about two thirds in the past two years to around $8.13 and a $272 million market cap. Its stock has hit the lowest price since 2002 (Nasdaq: RGP).\n\nEmployees were told about the move only a few days before it was announced, a source told the Business Journal. The company, spun out of Deloitte & Touche in 1996, has 757 employees who are referred to internally as professional consultants. They work with Fortune 100 and 500 companies who need to fill positions in a range of positions including finance, HR, technology and supply chain.\n\n“Employees should not experience any change in processes or procedures with this transition,” the spokesman said.\n\nThe company couldn’t say how many of its 200 employees in Orange County will be moving to Dallas.\n\nHQ Sale and New Irvine Lease\n\nThe company originally paid $9.8 million for the former 57,301-square-foot HQ facility in 2005, according to records from real estate market tracker CoStar Group Inc. The city of Irvine bought the building for $13 million in August, according to the company’s filing with the SEC.\n\n“We found that people are working differently now, and we didn’t need that amount of real estate,” Duchene told the Business Journal last month, referring to remote work caused by the pandemic.\n\nThe city plans to use the building to expand its operations and permit a reconfiguration of Irvine’s existing, 191,000-square-foot Civic Center at the intersection of Alton Parkway and Harvard Avenue “to address both city council expansion and Police Department related space needs,” according to city records.\n\nOfficials previously reported that RGP had leased a new 18,178-square-foot-building in Irvine at 2030 Main St. after the HQ sale. This location will operate as a service center “providing finance, HR, IT and other operational support for global employees,” RGP said.\n\nLess Activity Among Clients\n\nRGP recently shifted and redesigned its operational model to better showcase its different business segments and drive growth in a tougher economic landscape, according to Duchene.\n\nThe reorganization comes as the company has seen many of its clients put projects on hold over the past year.\n\nThe firm has three principal business segments: On-Demand, Veracity for next-gen consulting and Countsy for outsourced services.\n\nFor the On-demand segment, the firm places its people within companies to step into specific projects under an executive leading the venture, whether it’s employee changes or technology transitions. The consulting division is designed to help companies with “transformational initiatives” from start to finish.\n\nIn RGP’s outsourcing business, which began with startups, the firm’s consultants are employed as a third-party group to build infrastructure such as HR and financial departments, or a back-office team, for companies who do not have additional staff or funds.\n\nThe fiscal first quarter ended Aug. 24 also marked RGP’s first time reporting revenues for each segment. Total first quarter sales fell 20% to $137 million.\n\nDuchene who has been CEO since 2016, last month said businesses have been tightening their budgets in fear of a recession this past year.",

      "# [Todd Gower Changed Course for the Better by Billy Yost on 2025-01-13](https://americanhealthcareleader.com/2025/todd-gower-la-care-health-plan/)\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nTodd Gower recalls the day he returned to his home in the Republic of Panama, where he was living as an expat finance director for Marriott International Hotels. The decision had been brewing for some time, but that evening, it crystallized. Picking up the phone, he called his wife and delivered the news: “I’m done with hotels.”\n\nIt was a bold declaration, especially since he didn’t have a new job lined up or a clear idea of what would come next. What he did know was that his career in hospitality had reached its conclusion and that he had made the choice to move on.\n\n“I realized I wanted something different,” Gower reflects. “I didn’t know what that was yet, but I knew staying where I was wasn’t it.”\n\nThe decision wasn’t one that Gower made lightly. It was the culmination of years of experience, countless challenges, and a growing sense that it was time to take a leap into the unknown. He thought if the change did not work, he could always come back. Over twenty-four years later, he has not.\n\n“I love taking care of people,” Gower says. “But ensuring a great guest experience had run its course for me. Arguing about midcentury versus midcentury modern design wasn’t going to change my life. I wanted to make a bigger difference. I wanted to help people on a fundamental level, and healthcare offered me the opportunity to do that every day.”\n\nToday, Gower is the chief compliance officer for L.A. Care Health Plan, the nation’s largest publicly operated health plan. Every day, Gower helps make decisions that will help millions of people. It’s a role he relishes even after working for some of the most recognizable names in healthcare, like Kaiser Permanente, Blue Shield, and Ernst & Young’s healthcare practice.\n\nFor Gower, joining L.A. Care was not just a career move—it was an opportunity to make a difference. What drew him to the organization was its mission and unique role in serving one of the most diverse patient populations in the United States.\n\n“It’s rare to find an organization with such a profound connection to the community and a diverse leadership team that is all rowing in the same direction,” Gower explains. “L.A. Care stands at the intersection of diversity, equity, and care, which is incredibly inspiring.”\n\nBut there was another reason L.A. Care felt right. It allowed him to channel the full breadth of expertise he had developed over his career in consulting and industry. “For the first time, I could focus all my tools and strategies toward serving a singular stakeholder: the member,” he says. Gower believes the members of L.A. Care are the heartbeat of L.A. County.\n\nFor Gower, the opportunity to unify his skills for a common purpose was more than appealing—it was a calling.\n\n“Having been an advisor to C-suite clients, often in an interim, fractional or trusted advisor role, I thought it was time for me to apply all those experiences for a single institution,” the CCO explains.\n\nThe organization’s leadership team and mission-driven nature also attracted him. “Every person I spoke with during my interviews talked about the mission here,” he recalls. “It’s embedded into the DNA of this place.”\n\nSince joining L.A. Care as an advisor to the chief compliance officer in the spring of 2021 and later stepping into the CCO role in the fall of 2023, Gower has been instrumental in shaping the organization’s compliance efforts amid the shifting realities of a post-pandemic world. Among his compliance initiatives is championing enhancing compliance oversight for home healthcare and hospice agencies—a sector that has drawn increasing attention from regulators and the Department of Justice.\n\nGower emphasizes the critical need for robust compliance monitoring and auditing in these areas to ensure L.A. Care members receive high-quality care. “Home healthcare and hospice services are essential to the well-being of our members. Home healthcare supports recovery and helps prevent hospitalizations, while hospice services provide compassionate care to individuals during the most vulnerable stage of their end-of-life journey,” he explains. “Strong oversight is essential to ensuring these agencies meet the highest standards of care.”\n\nHis passion for improving at-home care is both professional and personal. Gower witnessed firsthand how evolving at-home protocols, spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, transformed treatment possibilities. “New infusion techniques, advanced communication platforms, and diagnostic technologies have made at-home care viable for less severe, more treatable conditions,” he says.\n\nBy championing these innovations and embedding compliance at every step, Gower is helping L.A. Care Health Plan navigate a healthcare landscape where at-home care is becoming an increasingly vital component of patient recovery and overall system efficiency.\n\nThose evolving possibilities were top of mind for the CCO as he had stepped away from the California Assisted Living Association (CALA) conference to speak with AHL. He discussed how, even beyond his role at L.A. Care, he champions healthcare innovation.\n\nGower currently serves on the board of directors for Doctor2Me, a gig-tech marketplace that connects patients with doctors either virtually or in person at patients’ homes. It’s an organization Gower is supporting because its healthcare model represents a change he and patients want to see.\n\n“I know other companies have tried a concierge healthcare model, but it’s something I want to see work in our world,” Gower says. “I serve on the boards of a few different organizations that are utilizing technology in ways that I believe can serve patients and make people’s lives better.”\n\nCuriosity is the thread that weaves through every chapter of Gower’s professional journey. Whether you’re exploring his résumé or having a conversation with him, it’s clear that his relentless drive to learn and explore has been the cornerstone of his success.\n\nGower is also a vocal advocate for executive coaching, particularly for those leaders in the compliance space. He views coaching not as a luxury but as a necessity for leaders tasked with navigating the increasingly complex demands of the field.\n\n“As compliance officers progress in their careers, the stakes get higher, and the room for learning through failure narrows,” Gower says. “Having a trusted partner to bounce ideas off of—someone with the experience and insight to guide you—becomes invaluable.”\n\nTo Gower, executive coaching goes beyond mentorship. It’s a powerful tool for refining judgment, building confidence, and making critical decisions in roles where precision is paramount. This perspective underscores his deep belief in the transformative power of continuous learning and collaboration.\n\nGower’s curiosity has also driven him to connect with compliance professionals across industries—a move he describes as eye-opening. Despite differences in sectors or locations, the challenges these leaders face often share common threads, such as staffing issues or cybersecurity threats. Broadening his worldview through these conversations has sharpened his ability to convey the importance of building sustainable compliance programs across his organization.\n\nHowever, for Gower, learning from others is not limited to strategy or initiatives. Sometimes, it’s personal. “All of us have pressure points we may not recognize, and we all have insecurities that can surface in ways we didn’t foresee,” Gower says. “Sometimes, you need support to identify the things you can’t see in yourself.”\n\nGower’s leadership philosophy is deeply rooted in reflection, growth, and continuous learning. For those in healthcare leadership—or anyone looking to expand their perspective—he recommends Michael A. Mason’s Gladiator Always. After hearing Mason as a keynote speaker, Gower was inspired to dive into the book, which he describes as a must-read for leaders navigating healthcare’s complexities.\n\nGower’s story is one of courage and conviction—a reminder that embracing change can lead to both personal growth and the opportunity to make a lasting difference in the lives of others.",

The RGP Transformation Barometer shows that 91% of respondents reported that their organization is planning to increase its overall investment in workforce strategy development in 2025. Nearly half of financial decision makers (46%) said their organization remains focused on increasing resources to reskill and upskill existing employees, while 22% plan to increase investment in outside talent, and 18% expect to increase investment in internal headcount.\n\n“We’re seeing constant shifts in how companies are aligning their workforce priorities as they navigate a lower interest rate environment, widening skills gaps, and constant change spurred by AI,” said Kate Duchene, Chief Executive Officer of RGP. “More than one-third of financial decision makers believe that policy changes under the new administration will have the biggest impact on their investment in workforce development, yet leaders we surveyed were more concerned by employee retention and engagement, growing urgency to better leverage AI, and hiring challenges. These factors will continue to shape the way businesses are prioritizing their workforce investments in the year ahead.”\n\nRecent Interest Rate Cuts\n\nMore than half of financial decision-makers surveyed (58%) expect increased investment following last year’s three interest rate cuts to begin flowing within the first six months of 2025. Four out of five respondents (79%) said they expect to see increased investment flowing this year.\n\nNearly 70% of respondents expect their organization to unlock new capital in digital transformation and AI in 2025. Respondents also cited workforce development (48%), enterprise resource planning (47%) and business process optimization/automation (46%) as top areas of increased investment in a lower interest rate environment.\n\nWidening Skills Gaps\n\nOne in four respondents (26%) said they are currently experiencing widening skills gaps within their organization – an increase from 17% in October’s survey. Nearly two-thirds of respondents (63%) said they expect their organization’s skills gaps to increase in 2025. Meanwhile, 27% reported that their organization has narrowed its skills gaps with AI and other digital tools.\n\nBusinesses continue to be impacted by the shortage of accountants, with 40% of respondents reporting that their organization is currently facing a skills gap in accounting. More than one in four financial decision-makers (27%) expect this gap to widen this year.\n\nAI Investments\n\nTwo-thirds of financial decision-makers expect customer service to be the function impacted most by their organization’s AI investments over the next 12 months. Respondents also cited operations (64%) and marketing (60%) as areas where they expect to see the biggest impacts.\n\nThe RGP Transformation Barometer is a quarterly survey that explores the shifting workforce dynamics and investment priorities that organizations face. The findings are based on a poll of 201 U.S. full-time professionals conducted January 2 - 9, 2025. The poll consisted of respondents at the director level or above who influence finance decision-making at organizations with $500 million or more in annual revenue.

      "# [InScope Raises $4.3 Million to Expand Auditing Platform by PYMNTS, www.facebook.com on 2024-06-12](https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2024/inscope-raises-4-3-million-to-expand-financial-reporting-auditing-platform/)\nInScope officially launched and announced it raised $4.3 million to grow its platform designed to facilitate financial reporting and audits for private companies.\n\nThe platform is designed to provide a solution for a process of putting together financial statements that is currently time-consuming and prone to errors, the company said in a Wednesday (June 12) post on LinkedIn.\n\n“At InScope, we’re looking to change this by giving accountants superpowers so they can easily and quickly complete these tasks through our platform, which leverages machine learning and large language models,” InScope said in the post. “Now, accountants can focus on strategic initiatives rather than get bogged down by manual and time-consuming tasks.”\n\nLeveraging generative AI and large language models automates significant parts of the workflow, drastically reduces the time and effort required, and eliminates time spent on manual processes, Mary Antony, CEO and co-founder of InScope, wrote in a Wednesday blog post.\n\nAntony and Kelsey Gootnick, chief operating officer and co-founder of InScope, formed the company after leading accounting and finance teams at several companies, according to the post.\n\n“We have seen firsthand the challenges and frustrations of the existing processes,” Antony said in the post. “Now, at InScope, we’re building the solution we always wished we had.”\n\nInScope’s investors include Lightspeed and Better Tomorrow Ventures, according to the company’s LinkedIn post.\n\nJC Bahr-de Stefano, a venture capital investor at Better Tomorrow Ventures, said in a Wednesday post on LinkedIn that InScope is already working with a handful of companies to help streamline their financial reporting needs and enable accountants to complete their reporting tasks in minutes instead of months.\n\n“Their technology compiles information from the company’s core systems, like their ERP, and publicly available information from SEC guidance,” Bahr-de Stefano wrote. “Then, their internal rules engine transforms those inputs into GAAP-compliant financial and audit documents.”\n\nIn another recent product launch that included financial reporting, Countsy said in April that it debuted an online platform that is designed to simplify back-office management by providing a centralized place for essential business tools and collaboration.\n\nThis portal includes integrations with clients’ enterprise resource planning, payroll, accounts receivable and payable, financial reporting, expense management, HR tools and other resources.",
      "# [Healthcare Drives Strong Jobs Growth Despite Complex Underlying Conditions by Tyler Conner on 2024-07-16](https://meetveracity.com/2024/07/16/healthcare-drives-strong-jobs-growth-despite-complex-underlying-conditions/)\nThe Labor Department’s December jobs report indicates that employers added 216,000 new jobs in December with 40% of the gains coming from the healthcare sector, which added 38,000 new positions in fields such as ambulatory healthcare services and hospitals. At first glance, this steady surge in hiring could be encouraging news for the healthcare industry, which has experienced acute business and clinical staffing shortages that have made it challenging, if not impossible, to execute mission-critical initiatives.\n\nThe continuing prominence of healthcare in driving new job additions in the U.S. labor market suggests a sustained demand for healthcare professionals. Although many healthcare organizations have seen their employment numbers return to pre-pandemic levels, the persistent effects of pandemic-related workforce shortages still linger. This is attributed to multiple factors, including regional workforce disparities, heightened healthcare needs of an aging population, specialized skill requirements, and the ongoing impact of the mental health crisis.\n\nWhile the increasing job opportunities in healthcare offer some relief, they are unlikely to fully resolve the existing staffing challenges observed in the healthcare sector. Amidst the short-term gains in healthcare employment numbers, underlying systemic issues persist within the U.S. healthcare industry. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), the U.S. population is projected to grow by 10.6% to 363 million by 2034, with a staggering 42.4% increase in the population aged 65 and above.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. may face a shortage of 54,100 to 139,000 physicians by 2033. Therefore, despite the current upsurge in job numbers, the increased demand projected within the U.S. healthcare ecosystem remains a significant challenge that these short-term gains in employment are unlikely to address adequately.\n\nHigh labor costs constitute a substantial portion of a healthcare organization’s expenses for both payers and providers. When these costs rise, they directly affect the overall financial health of hospitals and healthcare providers. The increased expenses lead to reduced profit margins, impacting the ability of payers and providers to invest in technological advancements or improved patient care services. Additionally, labor costs also impact the overall efficiency and productivity of the healthcare ecosystem. When facing budget constraints due to high labor expenses, providers typically reduce staffing levels or cut back on training programs.\n\nThis reduction in workforce or inadequate training directly affects operational efficiency, leading to longer patient wait times, delayed care delivery, and increased administrative errors. This ultimately leads healthcare organizations to compensate for staffing shortages with aggressive technology implementation (s) such as automation or outsourcing with hopes of filling the staffing gap. However, these strategies require careful consideration to ensure they don’t compromise patient care quality or negatively impact staff morale.\n\nLastly, elevated labor expenses can create challenges in managing the revenue cycle effectively. Healthcare providers often struggle to balance the rising costs with adequate revenue generation. Delays in billing, coding errors, or inefficient claims processing due to staff shortages or high labor expenses can disrupt cash flow, impacting revenue collection and financial stability, and therefore put many healthcare organizations under immense financial pressure leading to sustainability challenges.\n\nA key factor in the coming year for healthcare providers is artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) and the critical determinants and challenges that must be addressed to fully assess and effectively implement generative AI as a solution for workforce shortages.\n\nThe argument supporting generative AI as a solution for workforce shortages in healthcare is multi-faceted. There’s a prevalent consensus within the industry that generative AI holds transformative potential across various healthcare facets like patient care, diagnostics, research, and education. This expectation fuels a surge for AI integration into workflows among payers, providers, and life sciences entities.\n\nHowever, while recognizing its potential, several critical factors must be addressed to determine the scale and pace of AI adoption in healthcare such as regulatory compliance, ethical considerations, and accessibility issues as pivotal determinants governing the extent of AI integration across the healthcare landscape.\n\nDespite its potential, only a small fraction of healthcare workers in a Gartner survey considered their jobs could be replaced by AI at present (11%), with a slightly higher percentage (15%) envisioning this replacement within the next five years. Their perspective underscores that AI primarily serves to enhance efficiencies and facilitate skill development within their existing roles, rather than replacing them outright. This suggests that while AI is seen as a tool for augmenting and improving existing workflows, its full-scale replacement of human healthcare roles remains a concept for the future, but likely not the present reality.\n\nAll of these trends are occurring amid broader macroeconomic forces — and a profound shift in the makeup of the workforce. A global research study conducted by RGP in 2023 revealed a massive redistribution of talent and created a large pool of highly skilled independent workers.",
