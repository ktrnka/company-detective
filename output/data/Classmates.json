  "summary_markdown": "# About Classmates\n\nClassmates.com is a social networking service founded on November 17, 1995, by Randy Conrads. The company is headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, and is known for connecting high school alumni. As of 2023, it boasts over 90 million members and features a vast archive of over 470,000 digitized high school yearbooks [(Contributors to Wikimedia projects, Wikipedia, 2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classmates.com). The platform allows members to purchase reprints, engage in private messaging, view class lists, and plan reunions.\n\nClassmates.com was acquired by United Online in 2004 and later sold to PeopleConnect Holdings, Inc., a portfolio company of H.I.G. Capital, in 2015 [(Contributors to Wikimedia projects, Wikipedia, 2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classmates.com). The company generates revenue through paid subscriptions and advertising sales, with a business model that relies heavily on user-generated content [(Contributors to Wikimedia projects, Wikipedia, 2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classmates.com).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Sarah Howe**: President of the Classmates division.\n- **Steven Gray**: CEO of PeopleConnect Holdings, Inc.\n- **Sach Barot**: CFO of PeopleConnect Holdings, Inc.\n\nThese individuals are responsible for overseeing the operations and strategic direction of Classmates.com [(Contributors to Wikimedia projects, Wikipedia, 2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classmates.com).\n\n# News\n\n## Legal and Ethical Challenges\n\nClassmates.com has faced several legal challenges, including a consumer protection lawsuit in California, which led to updates in subscription renewal disclosures. The company also settled a $2.5 million class action lawsuit regarding misleading email practices and agreed to pay $960,000 in a settlement over hidden online shopping fees [(Contributors to Wikimedia projects, Wikipedia, 2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classmates.com).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\nIn 2020, PeopleConnect merged with The Control Group, enhancing its B2C information services capabilities [(Contributors to Wikimedia projects, Wikipedia, 2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classmates.com). This merger is part of the company's strategy to adapt its business model in response to evolving market dynamics.\n\n## Other News\n\n- Classmates rallied to help release a woman from immigration detention [(Nicole Acevedo, 2020-02-14)](https://news.yahoo.com/classmates-rally-help-release-young-185300770.html).\n- A school shooting was thwarted after a student overheard a threat targeting classmates [(TIME, 2018-01-27)](http://time.com/5121596/uniontown-high-school-shooting/).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nClassmates.com remains a significant player in the niche of social networking for alumni, despite facing challenges from larger platforms like Facebook. Its extensive yearbook collection and features aimed at fostering connections among former classmates provide unique value. However, the company has faced legal challenges and must navigate a competitive landscape. Prospective users and investors should consider these factors when evaluating the platform.

It’s a clear attempt to find age, hometown, and photos of job candidates. Has it really come down to this? I’ve taken down everything except for deleting the account entirely. By default the nature of the Classmates platform is that it lists your schools’ location and graduation date.

Nearly every potential employer is going to do a quick look either before the interviews or after while they are considering applicants.

I deactivated my Facebook in 2015, but reactivated it in 2021 when I was job hunting. I have since maintained it similarly to my LinkedIn. Never had anything else as I really didn't care, I never post anyway.  \n\n\n Reddit is basically 4chan with forced usernames. Similar to forums I used to post on. This site is almost completely anon with the exception the leadership having an email and it's your choice if that email matters or not as an identifier. \n\n\n I have noticed an uptick on Reddit lately though of people who think short account age and lack of history is sus. I delete and remake my reddit accounts constantly.\n\n\n The younger generation is terminally online to their detriment. They seem to place value in having an online identity that is tied to their real world counter which I personally will never understand.  \n\n\n This makes me an \"old\", which is why I have a public facing Facebook, because \"old people use Facebook\". If they can find a Facebook they will just say oh they are old rather than even bringing up that it's sus that I have a minimal online footprint.\n\n#### Comment ID lrbwisu with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-10-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1fy6ars/should_we_delete_our_classmates_com_accounts/lrbwisu/) (in reply to ID lqtzykd):\nI keep an alt reddit account that's less opinionated just incase they want a list of accounts\n\n#### Comment ID lrcehqa with +1 score by [(Lex_Orandi, Reddit, 2024-10-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1fy6ars/should_we_delete_our_classmates_com_accounts/lrcehqa/) (in reply to ID lqtzykd):\nMy sister in law discouraged my wife from going on a second date with me because I wasn’t anywhere to be found on social media.

You'd find your school and graduating year then join your classmates. Was a way to see what everyone has been up to since graduating, reunions, random stuff like that. When Facebook made Groups it pretty much killed Classmates, you could just make a group for your reunion or anything. \n\nI signed up under a made up name back in the day and never uploaded anything identifiable.

Everyone should freeze their account there (theworknumber\"dot\"com). I made a couple different posts on antiwork about it and they never got any traction. I tell everyone I know to freeze their accounts and few people take it seriously. The Work Number has so much information about your previous employment including salary, vacation and sick time taken, if you were enrolled in benefits or 401k, how much your deductions were, etc.\n\nImagine you are getting paid $80k at your current job and you apply for a job with an advertised salary of $95k. You try to be casual about it during the interview and say \"I'm looking for at least $95k. I make just a bit less than that at my current job, so with my experience and tenure I feel like $95k is fair compensation.\" They say \"Yep, sounds fair, that's right in line with our budget for this position.\" And then they pull your background check, including your job history through TWN, and find out you currently only make $80k, and lowball you at $84k.

You want just enough online prescence to show you're a real person, it's ok if that persona appears boring. My boss friend requested me on Facebook and ultimately used photos that were about 15 years old (college times) to embarrass me at a work dinner.

Jobs were one of the main reasons. I personally would not tie my name to anything if I can avoid it, and I set my privacy settings to as strict as I can. Like on Facebook, you can search my name or email all day, and you won't find me because it is not publicly available. I don't use my real name for Twitter, YouTube, or anything I can avoid. Really, just Facebook has my name, and unless I find you, you can't see my Facebook. And I don't even say or do things that I am worried about, I just like my privacy. \n\nYou never know what you say today that won't be okay tomorrow.

      "# Post ID f51fx2: Received an email from classmates.com about account registration using my real full name. But I didn't make the account and the password is something I've never used. with +15 score by [(fritocloud, Reddit, 2020-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/f51fx2/received_an_email_from_classmatescom_about/)\nClassmates.com... sounds familiar right? The kings of spam. They came out before Facebook and friendster but they went with the premium model and I had assumed they would have went out of business. I know they were sued at one point for deceptive advertising practices because they would email you saying that something was happening with your account but you had to pay to see what it was. And then when you paid, you would discover that nothing was happening with your account. Well, I just got an email from them welcoming me to the site. The thing is, I didn't make an account with them. I honestly can't remember if I ever made one with this email account (I know I signed up with them at some point but I'm pretty sure I was still using an AOL account at the time, lol. And that was many many years ago.) Anyways, I've gotten emails like this before where someone is using my email address with random info and I just assume it is some sort of scammer or spammer or bots or whatever. I usually go in and report or deactivate the account and no big deal. But this is the first time it has ever happened with my real first and last name. The other weird thing is they are using my full first name and for most things that I sign up for, I use a shortened version of my name. Which makes it less likely they got my name from one of those data leaked lists but not impossible. \n\nThere is a button to report the account for \"being made in error\" but that's the final twist to this. I really don't trust classmates.com and I really don't want to click that link in the email until I know what's going on. The way I see it, this could just be a diabolical plot on classmates.com's part, trying to get customers for their site or whatever.\n\nSo, I guess what I'm looking for is any advice on how to handle this. I should note that I do monitor my credit reports pretty thoroughly so I'm not too worried about any kind of identity theft issues with my SSN attached. Also, has anyone else had this happen to them? With this specific site or another site? Does anyone have any idea how this would happen? I very much doubt it is a real person who just coincidentally has my exact name and that they mistakenly put *my* email address (which is fairly unique and does not have my name in it at all) in when they were signing up.\n\n[Here is a screenshot with my info and the info from the fraudulent account omitted.](http://imgur.com/a/FwRkO4G)\n\nAlso, [here is some dogtax](http://imgur.com/gallery/TzWkUWO) (not mine found it on imgur while uploading my screenshot.

But instead of using that power to toy with peoples lives for the sake of curiousity, Ralsei does his best to avoid that type of disaster. He knows that Kris has this power, and he knows the dangers of it. \n\nInstead of asking please never do a true reset like Flowey does at the end of credits. Ralsei is lying to Kris, specifically to fool us(the players) into thinking he is on our side, while he is slowly building a way to get rid of the Determination power from Kris. He is on the good side with good intentions, but he is not on OUR side. Even if it's a pacifist run, he still thinks it's too dangerous to have such power, so away it must go.\n\nI mentioned this theory on an r/ralsei poll [recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/ralsei/comments/pcxkrg/what_direction_would_you_like_ralsei_to_go_in/).\n\n### Comment ID hb4jkhd with +8 score by [(Grand_reaper658, Reddit, 2021-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb4jkhd/) (in reply to ID hb3mr3i):\ntemmie adventure?\n\n#### Comment ID hb5h2o5 with +2 score by [(KittyWarrior1, Reddit, 2021-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb5h2o5/) (in reply to ID hb4jkhd):\nyAYA!!!\n\n### Comment ID hb6pd5y with +8 score by [(M-striker, Reddit, 2021-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb6pd5y/) (in reply to ID hb3mr3i):\nThis….\n\nI want to believe is a metaphor, mostly in FARMING EXP: whenever kris/soul/frisk gets EXP his DETERMINATION increases, a power that gives him the ability to RESET, SAVE, ETC.

Jockington wears sunglasses; one of the purple items is ‘Cloudy Glasses,’ Temmie wears a brimmed cap; ‘Cowboy hat,’ Noelle is associated with christmas; you tie gift boxes up with Ribbons, and a toy knife is a potential gift. Snowy is very defensive about his comedy and potentially uses humor as a defense to begin with, and the green heart items are very defensive focused gear. Monster kid is pretty brave, considering he can stand up to Undyne, while he is wearing orange and I guess the glove is just kind of ironic. We don’t get a good look at Catti’s normal get-up, but being a waitress does require some level of grace a la ballet. As for Berdley, maybe it makes a bit more sense if you think of there being two red souls; Chara and Frisk, and thus they’re sort of rivals who aren’t that different in the end? I wouldn’t be surprised if Berdley turns out to have a similar situation to Kris, with Noelle being their only ‘friend.’\n\n#### Comment ID hb4e9o4 with +7 score by [(_AntiSocialMedia, Reddit, 2021-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb4e9o4/) (in reply to ID hb4crx4):\nThing is, so far, everyone in Deltarune has the same personality as their Undertale counterparts, different relationships and different jobs, yeah, but still the same personality.\n\nAnd, well, Snowy just isn't *that* nice in Undertale, he straight up calls Frisk unfunny if they tell a joke because he's jealous, and we know it's jealousy, and not Frisk just being unfunny, because even *Ice Cap* and *Jerry* think Frisk's jokes are funny.\n\n### Comment ID hbll4vn with +5 score by [(TheLegend2T, Reddit, 2021-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hbll4vn/) (in reply to ID hb4adde):\nII like how there's no debate Jockington is Perseverance\n\n## Comment ID hb3bz7g with +12 score by [(pascuales, Reddit, 2021-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb3bz7g/) (in reply to ID pfcg31):\nMakes sense considering that we have the main characters (Frisk; Kris, Susie and Ralsei) but in Undertale we wouldn't be able to win without the souls' help.

I go to a college that is about an hour from my home.  However, there were several people that went to a high school that was only 30 minutes from the college campus and only 40 minutes from my house.  The strangest thing about this is that one of those people is actually my cousin that I stopped talking to after I was 13 because her parents are not good people and never wanted a relationship with me, my siblings, or my other cousins (they are technically one of my aunts and uncles but don't call them as so).\n\nBut I'm glad I didn't go to college with anyone that I knew in high school.  I kinda had to start fresh and give myself opportunity to meet people that I totally enjoy more than some of my classmates from high school.  Not as petty or egotistic just because you mature and you get to be out of your comfort zone and if you don't like someone in college, you don't have to be around them as much, nor do you really see them as much (I grew up in a small town with the same people and bullshit).\n\nMy advice; don't go to the same college as someone just because they are your \"bestie\" and you have to be together nor should you room with them.  It creates differences and problems between you both and you might stop being friends, plus, you need to branch out and meet new people in your life.  The friends I made in college so far after my freshmen year are incredible people and it almost feels like I've known them for a long time.  I can't wait to see them again in August.\n\n## Comment ID juahfjl with +1 score by [(kakokapolei, Reddit, 2023-08-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/15esjzy/in_college_did_you_have_any_high_school_classmates/juahfjl/) (in reply to ID 15esjzy):\nNot initially, though I did see my cousin around from time to time and I was in the same class with someone I went to high school with for like 1 semester.\n\n## Comment ID jualhqw with +1 score by [(Prometheus_303, Reddit, 2023-08-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/15esjzy/in_college_did_you_have_any_high_school_classmates/jualhqw/) (in reply to ID 15esjzy):\nI was in the same honors program cohort as one of my classmates so we had one class together each semester.

Grades 3-5, very few kids had a cell phone, it was uncommon. It wasn’t something the school had to address yet. But the expectations were pretty much that cell phones should never be seen at school. Even after school in the pick up/drop off zone, you’d have admin or teachers enforcing this. \n\nCrazy to imagine now because yeah I agree the general consensus was that phones were not for kids. Nowadays, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with giving a child a flip phone to make emergency calls. I can see why some families may need to do that. \n\nI ended up being the first of my friends to get a cell phone. 6th grade. Christmas. Apparently, my parents were planning to give me one in 7th grade since I would be taking the bus. But then my mom was getting a new Razr and it was BOGO. I was so surprised when I unwrapped it because they swore they were against it. Both of them worked full time and it felt like life was always chaotic growing up, never knew what was going on, would find things out at the last minute, always seemed unprepared and late to be picked up. I also had undiagnosed adhd and anxiety at the time which didn’t help! But basically, I thought that having a cell phone would give me peace of mind.

As they get older you'll have more independent parties.\n\nThe first couple of my youngest parties my oldest probably had more guests then the youngest.

Rather than give lip service when an employee offers a suggestion only to toss it away in favor of what you think, it might be a good idea to consider them.  I know you think that because you're a VP you know more than the rest of us, but look back over the last three years.  See all that failure and waste of money & time?  Those were all your GREAT ideas.  \r\n\r\n3. YOU CAN'T SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH ANOTHER ROUND OF LAYOFFS.

In fact, when October rolls around, most employees begin telling jokes about who'll get released.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the biggest concern for UOL is that there seems to be no vision.  The future of the company almost seems as if it is being decided by a blindfolded man throwing darts. The Communications segment of UOL is currently still shackled to the dial-up ISP business, and after flopping around trying other directions, has now decided to gamble on the mobile broadband sector - except that they are using tech that is already 5 years out-of-date and trying to market it to a demographic that's still confused by cell phones.",

Rather than give lip service when an employee offers a suggestion only to toss it away in favor of what you think, it might be a good idea to consider them.  I know you think that because you're a VP you know more than the rest of us, but look back over the last three years.  See all that failure and waste of money & time?  Those were all your GREAT ideas.  \r\n\r\n3. YOU CAN'T SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH ANOTHER ROUND OF LAYOFFS.

In fact, when October rolls around, most employees begin telling jokes about who'll get released.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the biggest concern for UOL is that there seems to be no vision.  The future of the company almost seems as if it is being decided by a blindfolded man throwing darts. The Communications segment of UOL is currently still shackled to the dial-up ISP business, and after flopping around trying other directions, has now decided to gamble on the mobile broadband sector - except that they are using tech that is already 5 years out-of-date and trying to market it to a demographic that's still confused by cell phones.",

      "# [classmates.com by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2006-04-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classmates.com)\nSocial networking service\n\nclassmates.com is an American social networking service. It was founded on November 17, 1995 by Randy Conrads as Classmates Online, Inc.[2] and headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. It bills itself as the leading online social network service in the United States for bringing high school alumni together, with over 90 million members.[3]\n\nClassmates.com has an archive of over 470,000 old high school yearbooks that have been digitized. Members can also purchase yearbook reprints. Other features of the site[4] include private messaging, conversations, class lists and reunion planning.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2004, United Online acquired Classmates.com[5] and owned and operated the company as part of its Classmates Media Corporation subsidiary[6] until 2015.\n\nIn 2010, Classmates.com rebranded to Memory Lane, which included a website redesign,[7] and included content like movie trailers, songs, and photos. In 2011, Classmates dropped the Memory Lane brand. Classmates Media operated online social networking and loyalty marketing services under the Classmates.com[8] and MyPoints[9] brands, respectively.\n\nIn August 2015, Classmates was acquired by PeopleConnect Holdings, Inc., a portfolio company of H.I.G. Capital.[10] Classmates is now operated as a division of PeopleConnect,[11] which also owns Intelius.\n\nIn 2020, PeopleConnect completed a merger with The Control Group, a provider of B2C information services located in San Diego, California.[12]\n\nClassmates Media Corporation's business model is based on user-generated content and revenue from paid subscriptions and advertising sales.[5]\n\nAs of 2023, under the PeopleConnect leadership team, including CEO Steven Gray & CFO Sach Barot, the B2C information services division of PeopleConnect operates from the San Diego location. The Classmates division, led by President Sarah Howe, is located in Bellevue, Washington.\n\nUsers and ranking among other social networking sites\n\n[edit]\n\nThe only time Classmates appeared on Hitwise's top 10 list of social networking websites was in June 2009, when it appeared tenth with a 0.45% market share.[13]\n\nIn early 2008, Nielsen Online had ranked Classmates as number three in unique monthly visitors (U.S. home, work) among social networking sites.\n\nAs of June 30, 2008, Classmates Media had approximately 3.8 million paying subscribers, reflecting a 41% increase from the previous year.[14]\n\nIn 2006, television program The View mentioned Classmates.com as having more than 40 million[15] members in the United States and Canada.\n\nAccording to the Online Publishers Association Paid Content U.S. Market Spending Report, Classmates.com was Number 4 among the Top 25 Web Destinations Ranked by Consumer Content Revenue in both 2002 and 2003[16] (the last years that individual site rankings were broken out). As more users have moved to Facebook, the site has fallen in popularity.\n\nIn 2015 (the year the company turned 20), Classmates had over 70 million current members.[17]\n\nPrivacy\n\n[edit]\n\nClassmates.com members use real names,[18] not screen names, including maiden names. Member privacy is protected through a double-blind email system, so email addresses and contact information are never revealed unless self-disclosed by members one-on-one.\n\nDigital yearbook collection\n\n[edit]\n\nClassmates.com has an archive of over 470,000 yearbooks from the US, with some dating back to the 1880s. This represents the world’s largest digital yearbook collection. Classmates.com acquires these yearbooks and then scans them, creating digital copies that can be viewed online. Many of these yearbooks are available to purchase in hardcover or softcover reprints.\n\nThe oldest yearbook on the site is from 1886, from Central High School, Manchester, NH.[19]\n\nReunions\n\n[edit]\n\nClassmates.com members can plan and attend reunions on-site. In 2020, Classmates.com also rolled out the virtual reunion feature so that schoolmates can get together without having to travel, which was a new option during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLegal allegations\n\n[edit]\n\n5 District Attorneys in CA (including LA) filed a consumer protection lawsuit – Classmates updated its subscription renewal disclosures and settled the claim.[20]\n\nEmail settlement\n\n[edit]\n\nClassmates.com was alleged to have sent emails that told recipients their old friends from school wished to reconnect (and the recipients would need to buy Classmates.com memberships to receive their old friends' contact information). A class action lawsuit was brought against Classmates.com in 2008. The lead plaintiffs in the case were David Catapano and Anthony Michaels.[21] Classmates.com agreed to pay $2.5 million to its users to settle the lawsuit.[22]\n\nPiggybacking and post-transaction marketing\n\n[edit]\n\nClassmates.com was accused of piggybacking and post-transaction marketing.[23] Parent company United Online earned $70 million from marketing practices under investigation in 2009 by the Senate Commerce Committee. United Online denied the allegations and maintained that customers were provided clear disclosures before agreeing to transactions.[24]\n\nSettlement on hidden online shopping fees\n\n[edit]\n\nOn August 18, 2010, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced a settlement with six companies, including Classmates, as part of a probe into the discount club industry. Classmates were among the retailers that agreed to pay $2.1 million toward refunds and consumer education.[25] Under the alleged practice investigated, consumers who completed online purchases were presented with discounts or cash-back offers, and accepting these offers triggered small, easy-to-overlook recurring charges billed to unfamiliar company names. Classmates' share of the settlement amounts to $960,000 and a commitment to end these practices.[26]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nNames Database, owned by Classmates.com\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",

Edna Milanga ’21, MBA ’23, and her daughter attended Illinois State at the same time.\n\nAppears In Illinois State: Spring 2024\n\nOriginally from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Milanga started her academic journey at Heartland Community College, earning an associate degree and making her way through English as a second language classes before transferring to Illinois State to earn a bachelor’s degree in international business. Milanga later enrolled in Illinois State’s MBA program. Kazigwa wasn’t far behind, transferring to Illinois State for its computer networking and telecommunications program.\n\nTheir mother-daughter bond only grew when they became Illinois State classmates. Milanga and Kazigwa made time for each other during the week, meeting for meals and running errands together.\n\n“She was (on campus) early in the morning, and I would be there in the afternoon,” said Milanga. “Sometimes we would go for lunch in Watterson and have a good time. We went to the bookstore to order textbooks, and we went to a job fair together.”\n\nThey also used their experiences to help each other. Milanga guided her daughter through class scheduling. Kazigwa offered technology expertise in return.\n\n“We do homework together,” said Milanga. “She’s good with the computer, so when I’m stuck and frustrated, she helps me troubleshoot.”\n\nMilanga and Kazigwa said their unique experience brought them closer together.\n\n“We became closer friends. We shop together, do our nails together, watch shows together,” said Milanga. “She’s my BFF.”\n\nKazigwa walked across the same commencement stage as her mother last December.\n\nThis time, Milanga did the cheering.",
      "# [I’m Asian, But My Child Looks White. I Wasn’t Prepared For What Her Classmates Said To Her. by Miun Gleeson on 2025-02-26](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/asian-white-biracial-child-race-school_n_67b42912e4b011f6d4d8061c)\nAs an Asian parent, you never forget your child’s first… race-related incident.\n\nI’ve been training for this my whole life. I knew the day would come when the world would have something to say about my biracial child: curiosity at best, criticism at worst.\n\nBut I primed and prepped ahead of time. Shaped and changed by my personal experience of being teased and ridiculed for being Asian, I have always felt uniquely qualified to address similar challenges for my half-Asian child.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the first real incident didn’t unfold the way I thought it would.\n\nMy daughter’s fourth-grade class made a startling discovery about her this week: She is, in fact, Asian. Met with complete surprise by many, this “bombshell” unfolded in a way befitting many elementary school experiences: in humiliating, hurtful fashion.\n\nMy daughter’s class recently learned about Lunar New Year. While chatting with a friend, she made a passing reference to her Asian ethnicity. This breaking news quickly spread and was met with a collective gasp among her classmates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Wait, you’re ASIAN?!”\n\n“You don’t even look like it!”\n\n“Hey, guys, look who says she’s Asian!”\n\nUpon hearing about this incident after school, my reaction to her was equally incredulous:\n\n“Wait, they thought you were WHITE?”\n\nMy child is, indeed, half Asian and half white. She is a product of my full Korean-ness and her white father, whom she has always more closely resembled. She has my husband’s fair complexion, light brown hair, and enviably long eyelashes that frame her big, beautiful eyes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, the fact that her classmates had pegged her as white this whole time was news to me. As her mother, I have always seen my child as white and Asian. As for my daughter? She is understandably confused and upset that her classmates are now seeing her differently when her racial identity was never considered or remarked upon until now.\n\n“I overlooked that being half of something can be even harder to navigate. As a parent, I was so busy worrying about discrimination that I never anticipated disbelief.”\n\nAt this point in her barely decade-long life, my daughter’s ethnicity is just one aspect of her identity — nothing more, nothing less. Like many kids, she is more inclined to share other notable self-identifiers that capture who she is: an avid soccer player, a joyful singer who does her best work in the car, and a diehard donughnut enthusiast whose most objectionable quality among her peers might be that she hates ice cream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, again, I have been preparing for this since before she was born. I informally crafted a playbook to help counter all the greatest hits that would invariably come her way, including the classic standby: “What are you?” From an early age, I’ve led her toward a generous buffet of possible answers: American, Caucasian, Irish, White, Korean, Asian, Asian American. Mixed-race, blended-race, biracial, half this/half that. Take your pick, they all work. If simple facts don’t work to counter ignorance and insults about how you look, I advised, throw in some witty comebacks or withering looks. I’ve got lots of stuff in this starter pack.\n\nFor all my concern, however, there was always a hopeful asterisk in the plan — maybe my half-Asian kid would have it a bit easier than I did. Her “otherness” only comprised half of her identity, I reasoned. So perhaps her experience could be slightly mitigated by the fact that her name is easy to pronounce, and she doesn’t have the almond-shaped eyes that are so frequently seen as an invitation for insults against Asians.\n\nBut what happened in my daughter’s class showed me how wrong I was. I overlooked that being half of something can be even harder to navigate. As a parent, I was so busy worrying about discrimination that I never anticipated disbelief. Because, for multiracial people, there tends to be a follow-up; the ultimate insult added to the injury of the already-problematic question of “What are you?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProve it.\n\nAfter her classmates learned she is Asian, my daughter shared that some of them scrunched up their faces and gave her “weird looks.” What followed was an uncomfortable rapid-fire volley of pointed questions: If you’re Asian, do you celebrate Lunar New Year, too? Have you ever had kimchi? What do you MEAN you don’t like kimchi? Say something in Korean. Why don’t you speak Korean? But you just said you were Korean.\n\nI wish I could tell her that kids are just being kids, but deep down, I know this is merely a warm-up to a more intense cultural crucible that will continue throughout her life.\n\nThe one-two punch of assuming she was white and then expecting her to prove her Asian ethnicity is something I never dealt with. As a full Korean, my experience with racism was brutal but uncomplicated — the sing-song, ching-chong insult achieved its one-note cruelty every time. My otherness was never called into question because my unmistakably Asian face and “funny-sounding” name were all the credentials I needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy defensive playbook relied on the premise that she would be scrutinized or singled out for being Asian. It didn’t account for the possibility that the rest of the world wouldn’t see her as Asian — making her experience different from my own, and in some ways, more difficult. My one-size-fits-all, defensive posture failed to acknowledge the nuance and extra care needed in her specific situation.\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

      "# [From classmates to soulmates: Couple gets engaged at exact coordinates where they met in Polk State Nursing Program on 2025-02-14](https://www.polk.edu/news/from-classmates-to-soulmates-couple-gets-engaged-at-exact-coordinates-where-they-met-in-polk-state-nursing-program/)\n28.0336° N, 81.7138° W is more than just a set of coordinates—it’s the place where two Polk State College students found each other amidst the hustle of nursing school. The spot nestled on the Winter Haven Campus holds a deeply sentimental meaning for Natalie Tala and Zack Baksh.\n\nIn 2018, among the pressure of exams and the challenge of mastering medical skills, Tala and Baksh first crossed paths in the Polk State Nursing Program. What started as a shared academic journey soon blossomed into a love story, built on long hours of studying and getting to know each other. When the time came for Baksh to take the next step in their story, he knew exactly where he wanted to propose—the very spot where it all began at 28.0336° N, 81.7138° W.\n\nOn November 10, 2024, surrounded by the memories of their late-night study sessions and shared dreams, Baksh got on one knee and asked Tala to marry him. With Tala’s exuberant “yes,” their love story came full circle—proof that sometimes, the most extraordinary journeys start in the most unexpected places.\n\nFull-circle moment\n\n“It couldn’t have been a better location or a better moment,” Tala exclaimed. “This spot means so much to us. For our first anniversary, Zack gave me a bracelet with these coordinates. Getting engaged at the spot where we first met and spent countless hours just talking and spending time together throughout nursing school was really a full-circle moment.”\n\nBaksh first came to Polk State College as a student in its collegiate high school program. Inspired by members of his family who work in healthcare, he decided to pursue a career in nursing and called it a no-brainer to continue his education at Polk State.\n\n“It’s the local, affordable option,” he said. “But the Nursing Program is known for being rigorous and producing the best nurses. That’s the program I wanted to be in.”\n\nTala was also drawn to the program’s success, affordability, and proximity to home. Baksh recalls seeing Tala for the first time in their first semester.\n\n“I asked my friends who the cute girl in the pink scrubs was,” he laughed. “Then, we crossed paths in the parking lot.”\n\nThe parking lot where they would pledge to marry one another six years later.\n\nGrowing together\n\nThat same semester, Baksh was in a car crash that set him back in the program. He had to repeat the first semester, while Tala moved forward.\n\nHowever, this presented an opportunity for Tala to help Baksh with his studies, strengthening their immediate bond.\n\n“She was a big part of my support system,” Baksh reflected. “She was able to give me a heads up on what was to come in the program; what I needed to be studying and looking out for. She was able to guide me, and I was really grateful for that.”\n\nAt times, Baksh wasn’t sure if he would make it through. But Tala was there to support and motivate him, and he provided the same in return.\n\n“The Nursing Program is rigorous. Sometimes I thought, ‘Will I make it out?’” he added. “But Nat was there for me and helped me through.”\n\nPolk State’s Nursing Program boasted 100% licensure pass rates for the last three quarters of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.\n\n“We’re growing together, personally and professionally. It’s a special experience.”\n\n“You can tell when you are in the hospital, that those who are trained at Polk State stand out from the rest,” he said. “I am proud to say I’ve come from Polk State and I’m also proud of Nat and the incredible nurse that she has become.”\n\nTala received her Associate in Science in Nursing in 2020 and Baksh achieved his degree in 2021. They are both pursuing their Polk State Bachelor of Science in Nursing degrees while they serve as nurses for Lakeland Regional Health. They are on track to graduate in May.\n\nBaksh described Tala: “She’s meticulous. Her charting is top-tier. Her bedside manner is exceptional. Seeing the way that she treats patients and people inspires me to be a better nurse.”\n\nTala, in turn, described Baksh: “He’s strong, confident, and caring. He is very calm in his approach to nursing and always has the best interest of the patient at heart.”\n\nBaksh works on the cardiology floor while Tala serves in the intensive care unit. They will both transfer to Lakeland Regional Health’s new freestanding emergency department set to open this year in South Lakeland.\n\n“It’s exciting because we get to be part of the foundation of this brand-new building,” Tala said. “We’ll be the first team at this Lakeland Regional location and we’re really proud of that.”\n\n“We’re growing together,” Baksh added, “personally and professionally. It’s a special experience.”\n\nSchool, work & wedding planning\n\nTala will work the day shift, while Baksh will work nights. Luckily, they’re no strangers to balancing demanding schedules, always setting time aside to spend together, no matter how busy life gets.\n\n“Polk State helped me with my time management, expectations, and the importance of planning and preparation,” Tala explained. “We have a strong foundation.”\n\nTheir commitment to each other and their profession comes through in every aspect of their lives. Between caring for patients, finishing their bachelor’s degrees, and planning a wedding, the couple has learned to prioritize what matters most.\n\nWhen asked about juggling school, work, and wedding planning, Tala laughed it off with the confidence of a seasoned professional.\n\n“I’m not stressed about it, I’m the happiest I’ve ever been,” she said. Her calm demeanor reflects the lessons she’s learned throughout her nursing education—lessons that are deeply rooted in the foundation laid by Polk State.\n\nFor Baksh, his perspective on time management is influenced by his career choice as much as his relationship.\n\n“One thing that attracted me to the nursing profession was the schedule,” he explained. “I like that I can work three 12-hour days, then have four days off. It gives me a lot of time for family.”\n\nHe’s already envisioning a future where both his professional and personal lives flourish, and he’s grateful for the flexibility nursing offers to help him achieve that.\n\nAs they prepare to graduate with their bachelor’s degrees and embark on the next chapter of their lives, their shared journey at Polk State College has given them the tools they need to succeed in both their professional and personal lives. The same College that brought them together has prepared them to serve as exceptional nurses, ready to contribute to the local workforce and make a lasting impact on the lives of those they care for.",

Under the policies, students are prohibited from intentionally misgendering their classmates, defined as failing to use their preferred pronouns.\n\nBoth the policies and OLSD's student code of conduct also include \"transgender identity\" as a protected group, according to the lawsuit. This designation allows suspension and expulsion to be enforced in any cases of misgendering.\n\nPDE, with the of 17 states and 15 other advocacy groups, argued the policies promote compelled speech and violate students' religious rights. The parents' rights group also claimed the policies infringe upon families' rights to direct the upbringing of their children.\n\nHowever, U.S. Circuit Judge Jane Stranch ruled on July 29 that OLSD's policies are necessary to protect students from harassment. She concluded PDE would be unable to succeed on arguments that the policies compel speech in violation of the First Amendment.\n\n\"The District is entitled to recognize that speech about specific students' identities is particularly harmful and likely to disrupt the educational experience, and to regulate that speech accordingly,\" the ruling reads. \"PDE has failed to clearly show that, by doing so, the District engages in viewpoint discrimination.\"\n\nREAD MORE |\n\nFellow Circuit Judge Alice Batchelder argued in a lengthy dissent that public schools cannot force students \"to pretend [gender transition] is a real thing.\"\n\nAgree or disagree, but that is [PDE's] position,\" Batchelder wrote.\n\nOLSD said in a statement it is pleased with the ruling, noting the district remains committed to \"creating a safe and inclusive environment for all of our students.” Meanwhile, Nicole Neily, PDE president and founder, told Crisis in the Classroom (CITC) that while the group is \"disappointed,\" the ruling is \"not the end of the road.\"\n\n\"As Judge Batchelder persuasively explained in dissent: 'The First Amendment forbids the District from compelling students to use speech that conveys a message with which they disagree, namely that biology does not determine gender,'\" Neily said. \"PDE will seek further review of this decision.”\n\nEarlier this summer, the Ohio House passed a bill banning students from using bathrooms and locker rooms based on gender identity. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine previously expressed support for the legislation, telling reporters in June he would sign it \"as it stands now.\"\n\nThe bill currently sits with the Ohio Senate, which is not scheduled to meet again until November.",
      "# [I started university for the first time at 55 with Gen Z classmates by Colleen Sharpe, for CBC First Person on 2025-02-16](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/i-started-university-for-the-first-time-at-55-with-gen-z-classmates-1.7458348)\nThis First Person column is by Colleen Sharpe, who is a second-year student at the University of King's College in Halifax. For more information about CBC's First Person stories, please see the FAQ.\n\nI grinned to myself as the bus transported me and my new backpack full of books, paper and pens toward campus. It was my first day of realizing a years-long dream. My excitement grew as I got off the bus at a campus stop and found the classrooms.\n\nGoing into my small tutorial classroom, I glimpsed students looking expectantly at me as though I were the professor — perhaps a natural assumption since I was the only grey-haired person in the room. But when I took a seat among them instead of at the head of the room, they all quickly looked back down at their phones while I awkwardly riffled through my backpack.\n\nI didn't just go back to school at age 55. I began university for the first time in my 50s. For years, I would longingly read stories of older people going \"back\" to school, but typically, they were going to graduate school. I hadn't even had the opportunity to start — much less complete — an undergraduate degree, which was unusual given I had always loved being in school.\n\nGrowing up, I had won spelling bees and math certificates. I once memorized the human body's circulatory system just for fun. I thrived on organizing my homework assignments in a little notebook.\n\nHowever, my parents' divorce, my father's undiagnosed mental illness and my family's involvement in a conservative religious culture that shamed rock music, dating and women's education left me feeling depressed and sometimes suicidal during high school. When I had to drop a Grade 11 academic math course because I could no longer keep up with the workload of my university-prep courses, I felt I had lost my identity and hopes.\n\nI briefly considered going to hairdressing school, but by my last year of high school, my motivation was lost to undiagnosed depression.\n\nMy next 35-plus years were filled with jobs, marriage, children, volunteer work and the relief of depression treatment. I decided to give my children a home-based education, and I set about to figure out how. Today I know I made that decision because I loved learning. I wanted to pass this love on to my children. While planning their high school courses and helping them research post-secondary options, I began dreaming about attending university as well.\n\nOn the practical side, perhaps a degree would lead to interesting job opportunities. On the dreaming side, I had learned through the home-education project just how endlessly fascinating history, science and literature could be. Of course, I could just read and try writing on my own about any subject for the rest of my life. However, I wanted to do this with the feedback of experienced professors. I also felt that earning a degree would validate me to myself in a way that self-study couldn't. I had unfinished business of wanting to prove to myself that I was academically capable.\n\nStill, the idea seemed impossible — no time, no money and no confidence that I would be able to handle that level of learning. Nevertheless, I voraciously planned out multiple degrees for myself in nursing, costume studies, law, Irish studies, linguistics, cultural studies and more. By 2019, both our children had finished homeschooling, and I was self-employed as a reading tutor.\n\nThen tragedy hit our family in July 2021. Our then-20-year-old daughter was struck by a car and nearly killed. Our family got through this together with a lot of support, and helping my daughter recover became the focus of my life for the next two years. The shock of nearly losing her imprinted upon me just how fleeting life is.\n\nIn 2023, the idea of university surfaced yet again and I yearningly talked with a friend about it. She bluntly told me to apply because if I arrived at my deathbed without having tried, I would regret it.\n\nSo, one month before the fall 2023 semester was to begin, I applied for school and financial aid, \"just to see what would happen.\" I doubted I would be accepted for either.\n\nWithin weeks, I opened an acceptance email from the University of King's College in Halifax. I also received provincial and federal financial aid, with more grants than I expected, in addition to zero per cent interest loans. I had time, and now money was available. The last thing I needed was confidence, which would not arrive unless I actually committed to school. I wavered under overwhelming fears: could I keep up with all my responsibilities, would any of my younger classmates accept me, how would my husband and I make ends meet with my reduced self-employment schedule?\n\nHowever, with my husband's encouragement, I decided to take the plunge. What followed was the exhilaration of learning, as well as the overwhelming amount of work that I hadn't experienced since I cared for my newborn babies. My fellow students breezily tapped keys on their laptops, effortlessly formatting outlines during lectures while my hand cramped around my pen as I fumbled for the first time in many years with how to rapidly take useful notes.\n\nWhen a longtime friend called partway through my first month in university to ask how things were going, he calmly listened to me sob, \"I can't do this,\" and then gave me a pep talk.\n\nI decided to face my fears head-on. I memorized the names of every student in my tutorial group so I could greet them by name. I sat in different seats during daily lectures to try to engage in conversation during breaks. Emme and I shared our lives with each other on bus rides home. Kate offered to look over my papers. Later, I taught Kate to embroider.\n\nI had lost freedom with time, but, oh, the freedom that began to open in my mind while learning so many philosophical, historical and literary ideas with these kind students. I also may or may not have learned a Gen Z cultural reference or two, one of them being \"boygenius,\" and I may or may not have had to do some research to get a better understanding of it.\n\nBlessedly, the trauma of my daughter's accident began to fade. I stared down anxiety-filled semester-end oral exams as best as I could and finished my first year in April 2024 with new friends and a final grade that boosted my confidence.\n\nMy current hope is to combine English and the history of science and esoterica into a degree. While I wrestled with the practicality of this decision, I realized that as a mature student I already knew how to live my life practically. I wanted a chance to deepen my thinking skills through studying ideas that interested me. I came to understand that doing this enriches my practical skills anyway.\n\nMy university journey so far has proven to me that I am indeed academically capable. But more than that, it has taught me that if I desire to make a life change and can figure out how to make it happen, then my age does not matter. The bonus is that even when I question my academic abilities, my Gen Z classmates are among my biggest supporters.\n\nDo you have a compelling personal story that can bring understanding or help others? We want to hear from you. Here's more info on how to pitch to us.",
      "# [Ex-Indiana teacher accused of encouraging classmates to beat up 7-year-old with disabilities by Austin Mullen, Antonio Planas on 2024-04-19](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ex-indiana-teacher-accused-encouraging-classmates-beat-7-year-old-disa-rcna148469)\nA former teacher in Indiana is accused of orchestrating a “Fight Club” in which he allegedly encouraged classmates to beat up a 7-year-old student with disabilities and videotaping at least one assault, according to a lawsuit filed this week.\n\nThe 7-year-old boy's mother filed a lawsuit Tuesday in Marion County that also names Indiana Public Schools Superintendent Aleesia Johnson, George Washington Carver Montessori IPS School 87 Principal Mary Kapcoe and the child’s former teacher Julious Johnican.\n\nOther defendants include the district, the district’s Board of School Commissioners, the school’s assistant principal, a substitute teacher and a behavioral consultant.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, weeks into the 2023-24 school year, the child, who is identified only as \"O.D.,\" began complaining to his mother about being abused and harassed at school.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnican orchestrated “a reprehensible ‘fight club’ type of discipline within his classroom over a span of three months in which he encouraged, instigated, and on at least one occasion recorded on his phone physical abuse of O.D. by other students.”\n\n“In this horrifying setup, Johnican not only permitted but incited and facilitated other students to engage in acts of violence against seven-year-old O.D., which included at least three beatings and various forms of physical harm and bullying both for his own amusement or as a deeply disturbed disciplinary measure,\" the suit says.\n\nCatherine Michael, an attorney representing the student’s family, said the teacher appeared to be using the fighting as “a disciplinary technique.”\n\n“Instead of beating a child senselessly himself, at least according to what we have, he was allowing another child to do it,” Michael told NBC affiliate WTHR of Indianapolis.\n\nOn Thursday, a spokesperson for the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said that on Wednesday it opened an investigation into the allegations in the lawsuit at the request of the county’s prosecutor’s office.\n\nThe school district said in a statement that it took immediate actions once it learned of the allegations. It also said the teacher was initially suspended and then resigned on Nov. 2, before the district could begin termination proceedings.\n\n“IPS does not tolerate the type of behavior alleged in the complaint and takes reports of potential abuse and neglect seriously,” the district's statement said. “When IPS learned of the teacher’s conduct, the Department of Child Services (DCS) was immediately notified, and the teacher was removed from the classroom and suspended. The teacher had no further contact with students and is no longer employed by IPS.”\n\nThe district also said it was not made aware of the allegations the teacher encouraged fights until the parent emailed the principal on the evening of Oct. 30. But the principal did not see the email until the next morning and immediately contacted the Department of Child Services and the school system’s human resources personnel, the district said.\n\nA spokesperson for the district said Thursday that Johnson, the superintendent, and the school principal would not comment on the allegations.\n\nAttempts to reach Johnican, who is described as a first-year teacher in the district in the suit, were unsuccessful Thursday afternoon. Phone calls to numbers associated with his relatives were not answered.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the second grader was “thrown to the ground, struck, slapped, and hit in the head repeatedly\" in at least three attacks.\n\nJohnican, the suit says, held the child on two occasions while “allowing other students to punch, hit and kick him.”\n\nThe child’s mother had repeated meetings with Johnican to discuss her son’s allegations, but Johnican dismissed them and attributed the problem to the student’s behavioral issues and said the student was lying or mentally ill, the lawsuit says.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, on Sept. 22, the child’s mother told the vice principal of the allegations after she was called to the school because her son was hysterical and unable to calm down.\n\nHis mother went to the school that day and observed him in the classroom for 45 minutes. That day, her son again told her he was being abused in school, the suit says.\n\n“O.D. informed his mother that in the teacher’s presence and by his direction that another student had slammed his head down on a desk, pulled him to the floor, and then hit him repeatedly in the head. He directly indicated this was being done at the instruction of his teacher Mr. Johnican,” the lawsuit said.\n\nThe child, according to the suit, began asking to avoid school, and his grades slipped.\n\nOn Nov. 1, his parents had a meeting with Johnican, who intended to show a video of his classroom’s environment but instead inadvertently began showing a video of the student being attacked, the suit says.\n\n“When the parent attempted to grab the phone, he inadvertently turned up the volume where the parents could hear that it was him, the teacher, instigating and encouraging the beating of their disabled seven-year-old child,” according to the lawsuit.\n\n“The distressing content of the video made by Johnican shows O.D. on the floor crying as he is repeatedly punched in the face and head by a peer who is sitting on top of him as he cries out and begs for the attack to cease,\" it says.\n\nIn an interview with the Department of Child Services, the student said that he was assaulted twice in October and that Johnican held him down in one instance while a first grader slapped his face, according to the suit. And in a second alleged incident, Johnican held his shoulders while another student punched him in the stomach and kicked him in his legs, the suit said.\n\nSome of the claims in the lawsuit include negligent care and supervision; negligent hiring, retention and supervision; and intentional infliction of serious emotional distress.\n\nThe child is now homeschooled, he has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and he is in therapy at least once a week, the lawsuit said.\n\nThe suit requests a jury trial and says damages will be determined at trial.",
      "# [Focus on Bethel Park as classmates describe suspected Trump gunman by Edward Helmore, www.theguardian.com on 2024-07-15](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/15/trump-rally-shooter-bethel-park-pennsylvania)\nIn Bethel Park, where the man who is suspected of opening fire at a Donald Trump campaign rally on Saturday lived with his mother and sister, the houses are small and built of brick, Walmart and Target form central social hubs, and moms watch over their children at a junior league baseball park next to a tributary of the Allegheny River.\n\nThe attempted assassination of the Republican former president just 45 miles north has put a focus on Bethel Park, as investigators attempt to establish the motivations of the 20-year-old shooter.\n\nAuthorities on Sunday identified the suspect as Thomas Matthew Crooks. Officials said they believe Crooks acted alone. But so far, they have not been able to uncover a motivation that drove the young man to unleash a hail of bullets at Trump, wounding the former president and killing a former fire chief who was shielding his daughters.\n\nThe FBI said it would continue to investigate the attack as an attempted assassination and an act of domestic terrorism.\n\n“The information that we have indicates that the shooter acted alone,” said Kevin Rojek, supervisory special agent in charge of the FBI’s Pittsburgh field office. “At present, we have not identified an ideology associated with the subject, but I want to remind everyone that we’re still very early in this investigation.”\n\nThe FBI said Crook had not been on their radar. Since his identification, a fragmentary portrait has emerged, almost by virtue of its omissions. He was employed as a dietary aide at Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center. The nursing home’s administrator Marcie Grimm said Crooks “performed his job without concern and his background check was clean”.\n\nNor have there been significant clues found in his political affiliations. He had registered Republican but had also donated $15 to the liberal ActBlue political action committee on Joe Biden’s inauguration day. He had no past criminal cases against him, according to public court records.\n\nClaire, a young woman who had known Crooks through his elder sister and who did not provide a last name, said she could not quite believe the boy she had once known had attempted to assassinate a US president.\n\n“He’s so young to want to go do that,” she said.\n\nShe said Crooks had had a difficult time socially. “He wasn’t the most attractive-looking and I don’t think he did sports that can add appeal,’” she said.\n\nFormer classmates who spoke to other news outlets filled in other memories. Some described Crooks as smart and shy. Others spoke of a long history of being bullied. An unnamed former classmate told the New York Post that Crooks was “a loner”. He said: “He probably had a friend group, but not many friends.”\n\nJameson Myers said that Crooks had tried out for the school rifle team but had not made the roster. “He didn’t just not make the team, he was asked not to come back because how bad of a shot he was, it was considered, like, dangerous,” Myers told ABC News. Jameson Murphy told the Post that Crooks was “a comically bad shot”.\n\nMax R Smith said to the Philadelphia Inquirer that Crooks “definitely was conservative”. “It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate,” Smith said.\n\nWith a nation on edge, establishing Crook’s motives is seen as a key to unlocking larger issues of deep political discord.\n\n“We’re looking into his background, his day-to-day activities, any writings and social media posts that might help us identify what led to this shooting,”, the FBI’s Rojek said. “We have not seen anything threatening at this time”.",

So I was really excited about just having my class be part of where I'm heading next, you know?\" the Arkansas boy told \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nLuke's May 14 adoption was the culmination of months of bonding, a process he and his parents, Cassie and Bradley Kissinger, said was nearly instantaneous after they first met at a \"connection event\" hosted by Project Zero, an Arkansas nonprofit dedicated to promoting adoption.\n\n\"We started playing games at the event and those events can be a little awkward but it was actually not at all with [Luke],\" Cassie Kissinger recalled. \"I just kind of jumped in and started helping him with things and we walked around and we talked a lot. We got lunch together. So all the awkwardness went away really quickly.\"\n\nFor Cassie Kissinger, adopting Luke has been a longtime dream come true.\n\n\"I grew up in a family that fostered and adopted out of foster care. So I always wanted to do that. That was a dream of mine since I was a teenager,\" she told \"GMA.\"\n\nOn his adoption day, Luke said he was nervous, excited and overall, felt \"all the feelings combined.\"\n\n\"It was really fun but we had emotional parts too,\" he said.\n\nNow, the rising fifth grader calls Cassie and Bradley Kissinger mom and dad and also has a brother Aiden, also 11, and an older sister Alena, 14.\n\nAiden told \"GMA\" \"it's pretty exciting\" to welcome a brother into the Kissinger family fold.\n\n\"I mean, it gets annoying like other siblings, but we get along pretty well,\" he said, adding that he particularly enjoys playing video games with Luke or playing outside together in their backyard.\n\nThe Kissingers say for other families considering adoption, it's a journey that's well worth it.\n\n\"The kids don't want perfect. They don't need perfect. They just need someone to love them,\" Cassie Kissinger said. \"A lot of these kids have been waiting many years in foster care to be adopted and find a permanent family and it can truly change the trajectory of their life if they find that permanency.\"\n\n\"If you actually look at the statistics, the number of kids out there that just need some love is staggering. It's ridiculously high and I mean if you can be a part of changing even one of those kids' lives, go for it. Don't hold back,\" Bradley Kissinger added.",

Today, a student brought a weapon to Bookcliff Middle School. Another student immediately reported it to school administration, who quickly placed the school in a shelter-in-place as a precaution and contacted law enforcement. District 51 Safety and Security, along with the Grand Junction Police Department, immediately responded, located the weapon, and launched an investigation.
