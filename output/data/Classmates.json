      "# Post ID f51fx2: Received an email from classmates.com about account registration using my real full name. But I didn't make the account and the password is something I've never used. with +17 score by [(fritocloud, Reddit, 2020-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/f51fx2/received_an_email_from_classmatescom_about/)\nClassmates.com... sounds familiar right? The kings of spam. They came out before Facebook and friendster but they went with the premium model and I had assumed they would have went out of business. I know they were sued at one point for deceptive advertising practices because they would email you saying that something was happening with your account but you had to pay to see what it was. And then when you paid, you would discover that nothing was happening with your account. Well, I just got an email from them welcoming me to the site. The thing is, I didn't make an account with them. I honestly can't remember if I ever made one with this email account (I know I signed up with them at some point but I'm pretty sure I was still using an AOL account at the time, lol. And that was many many years ago.) Anyways, I've gotten emails like this before where someone is using my email address with random info and I just assume it is some sort of scammer or spammer or bots or whatever. I usually go in and report or deactivate the account and no big deal. But this is the first time it has ever happened with my real first and last name. The other weird thing is they are using my full first name and for most things that I sign up for, I use a shortened version of my name. Which makes it less likely they got my name from one of those data leaked lists but not impossible. \n\nThere is a button to report the account for \"being made in error\" but that's the final twist to this. I really don't trust classmates.com and I really don't want to click that link in the email until I know what's going on. The way I see it, this could just be a diabolical plot on classmates.com's part, trying to get customers for their site or whatever.\n\nSo, I guess what I'm looking for is any advice on how to handle this. I should note that I do monitor my credit reports pretty thoroughly so I'm not too worried about any kind of identity theft issues with my SSN attached. Also, has anyone else had this happen to them? With this specific site or another site? Does anyone have any idea how this would happen? I very much doubt it is a real person who just coincidentally has my exact name and that they mistakenly put *my* email address (which is fairly unique and does not have my name in it at all) in when they were signing up.\n\n[Here is a screenshot with my info and the info from the fraudulent account omitted.](http://imgur.com/a/FwRkO4G)\n\nAlso, [here is some dogtax](http://imgur.com/gallery/TzWkUWO) (not mine found it on imgur while uploading my screenshot. So cute.)\n\nThanks in advance, everyone.\n\n## Comment ID fhw7bmr with +13 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/f51fx2/received_an_email_from_classmatescom_about/fhw7bmr/) (in reply to ID f51fx2):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID fhwa4rw with +5 score by [(fritocloud, Reddit, 2020-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/f51fx2/received_an_email_from_classmatescom_about/fhwa4rw/) (in reply to ID fhw7bmr):\nJust the hope, though.

I just got one from Credit Karma in Canada. I'm not in Canada, and it was ten years ago I got a CK account I never used.\n\nIt was also very difficult to undo, or contact anyone saying \"not me, didn't sign  up, don't want it\". I had to call in my younger generation resources who hmm'd and said \"how odd\". But  did accomplish removal.\n\nIts a crummy practice and I doubt they really get any new business that way.

That email account is associated with Facebook so I guess they could have gotten it from there. I think I'm going to go directly to classmates.com and attempt to login with the info from the email. That might give me some more insight into the situation.\n\n## Comment ID fhxbr7e with +3 score by [(NEHOG, Reddit, 2020-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/f51fx2/received_an_email_from_classmatescom_about/fhxbr7e/) (in reply to ID f51fx2):\nDon't know if you know it, but for posts such as yours there is a kitten tax, not a dog tax. However your dog tax payment was so cute, we're waving the tax for you! \n\nFor your problem... I strongly suspect that it was someone who knows you well.

And good to know. Wouldn't want the RIRS (Reddit Internal Revenue Service) coming after me.\n\nAs to your suggestion, it is certainly possible. I'll make a list and think on it.

It’s a clear attempt to find age, hometown, and photos of job candidates. Has it really come down to this? I’ve taken down everything except for deleting the account entirely. By default the nature of the Classmates platform is that it lists your schools’ location and graduation date. I think as time goes on, social media accounts will come back to bite us.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID lqrnigf with +171 score by [(Sofer2113, Reddit, 2024-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1fy6ars/should_we_delete_our_classmates_com_accounts/lqrnigf/) (in reply to ID 1fy6ars):\nIf you don't already do a cursory social media scrub when job hunting, you need to start.

You want just enough online prescence to show you're a real person, it's ok if that persona appears boring. My boss friend requested me on Facebook and ultimately used photos that were about 15 years old (college times) to embarrass me at a work dinner. They were nothing that would jeopardize my job, but it wasn't something to share in a professional setting. That was an eye opening experience, and I now keep adding professional connections to LinkedIn only.\n\n## Comment ID lqrz2xz with +2 score by [(Big-Raspberry-2552, Reddit, 2024-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1fy6ars/should_we_delete_our_classmates_com_accounts/lqrz2xz/) (in reply to ID 1fy6ars):\nI’ve never heard of this site but it’s pretty common anymore for people to look at your social media pages for a job or whatever.

Jobs were one of the main reasons. I personally would not tie my name to anything if I can avoid it, and I set my privacy settings to as strict as I can. Like on Facebook, you can search my name or email all day, and you won't find me because it is not publicly available. I don't use my real name for Twitter, YouTube, or anything I can avoid. Really, just Facebook has my name, and unless I find you, you can't see my Facebook. And I don't even say or do things that I am worried about, I just like my privacy. \n\nYou never know what you say today that won't be okay tomorrow. Could also be as dumb as the person looking you up for a job might see you are an Ohio State fan, and they love Michigan, so they decide you're not the person for them.

      "# Post ID 8ciy5u: I love computer science. I hate my fellow computer science classmates. with +211 score by [(wtfthefuck, Reddit, 2018-04-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/)\nI need to get this off my chest, so please read my entire post instead of downvoting me based on my arrogant title. \n\nI am a computer science undergrad myself. I've always been fascinated with computers and the Internet ever since I was young. I simply cannot see myself working outside of this area - the incredible space for innovation and the power of exponential technologies is, to me, simply the most exciting thing I can think of. I constantly read about future technologies (shoutout to /r/Futurology) and find it disappointing that not many people share this admiration of mine, especially in this fantastic time period in which we live.\n\nI could spend hours talking about why I chose to study computer science, but I'll leave that for some other time. I need to talk about why I dislike my peers.\n\nI am definitely an introvert, but in my class of initially 50 people* I was probably the most outgoing. I haven't made many friends in college, which truly made me sad in the beginning because I could see myself making more (and better) friends if I were to study pretty much anything else. The only thing that me and 90% of my classmates have in common is that we, for different reasons, chose to study CS. Most of these people are your typical anime-loving gamers, which is of no interest to me. Most of them plan on focusing on game development, which is fine, but they simply don't have an open mind for other ideas an technologies. They play games and want to make games, as if that is even a realistic scenario. \n\nI don't even need to mention most of them are awkward as hell. This is no reason for me to dislike any of them, but it definitely makes it more difficult for me to bond with them. I have one good friend who shares common interests with me and doesn't act awkward at all. My other friends are nice people and (sometimes) good to hang out with, but they are definitely weird. I almost forgot to mention there is only one girl in my class, which really disappoints me, but I can't say I don't comprehend.\n\nI feel like we need more people in CS who are also interested in the arts and humanities, as I see this as an important trait for understanding the power of the technologies we deal with. As Steve Jobs said it, \"Edwin Land of Polaroid talked about the intersection of the humanities and science, I like that intersection. There’s something magical about that place.\"\n\nI think it is important to note that I am from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and this is based on my point of view, I don't want to generalize CS students. I guess in a more developed country more people would be interested and open to the possibility of studying CS, and therefore providing more diversity among students. And that is exactly what I would like to see.\n\nI hope I haven't offended any readers in any way with my personal thoughts. I'm just very passionate about technology and can't seem to get the same vibe from the people I deal with on a daily basis.\n\n*I would say 50% of the people who started college with me already quit. Every semester some people leave, and we only had 2 (TWO) people graduating in CS last semester. But CS is hard, nothing new here.\n\n\n## Comment ID dxfc6b7 with +113 score by [(valbaca, Reddit, 2018-04-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfc6b7/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\nYup. Sounds like CS Undergrad hasn't changed one bit (pun intended).\n\nI'm pretty antisocial but even I went outside the CS department to find friends because they were insufferable. Every guy thought they were Neo, or House M.D. or some other \"genius douche\" persona. Each with their own terrible concoction of technical arrogance that they try to cover up their own insecurities with.\n\nCollege should have no shortage of interesting groups you can join to meet.  Sports, politics, and diversity groups are usually the largest.\n\nPerhaps also look outside your immediate major; perhaps during electives and such. I did a dual EE / CS program and the contrast between (most) EE classmates and CS was astounding. EE students would work hard in groups, help each other, and would be happy to grab drinks or hangout afterward.\n\n### Comment ID dxfhhol with +16 score by [(hubbahubbawubba, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfhhol/) (in reply to ID dxfc6b7):\nI was in a similar program, and I think the contrast may have to do with when the programs break you, so to speak. In an EE program, you've already had to survive modern physics during or before the first semester of sophomore year. CS, by contrast, doesn't really break you until you take advanced algorithms (junior, or, for some people, even senior year). Having your own delusions of grandeur destroyed early helps foster the cooperative spirit you see in a lot of engineering programs.\n\n#### Comment ID dxfp8sd with +8 score by [(aogmana, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfp8sd/) (in reply to ID dxfhhol):\nI think this is a really good point.

I was a very social out-going person in highschool. Did the sports, drank the beer, etc. Firstly, you need to recognize that these people are a different breed. Secondly, you need to understand that you are a part of the problem (hear me out).\n\nI was always a computer guy though and loved playing games so I went in and you're right, the culture is very different. I was very jaded to not make friends quickly because everyone is so reserved. However, you need to understand that some people have a very hard time opening up and relating to people.\n\nFriendships are built off of social contracts. When going into a new environment with different types of people than what you are use to, you have to understand that you will not make friends if you do not share some interests. Anime is garbage, that's my opinion. Magic the Gathering is boring. Bassnectar is an overrated DJ. There are tons of things that I dislike however I will still support others and even venture down the rabbit hole to explore some of these topics to firstly, give company to potential friends and two, maybe see if I like it down the line. \n\nFriendship should be a two way street as well, so if you go to anime-con or whatever it is, try to get your new friend to do something that you like thats out of his/her comfort zone. People are reluctant to change, just like you. But breaking down barriers and trying things you don't like will either expose you to something that maybe down the line you enjoy, or expose other people to try other things that they might enjoy, and make friends while doing it.\n\nMy co-worker loves VR, soul-caliber, magic the gathering, and things I don't quite enjoy. However, I'll still go over and play some of these games because he likes to play them with people. Afterwards, I'll say lets hit the bar and he generally dragged his feet the first couple times but now he loves to go. And to be honest, play soul caliber has actually gotten a little fun, i must admit. My other group of friends love dubstep and going to Bassnectar shows. I dislike dubstep and Bassnectar and would rather see other artists, but I still have fun because I'm with people that are friends and we'll end up going to another show that I like sometime. Hell, I even got one of these hippy dudes to play some overwatch with me.\n\nAll in all, be more open to these people. Scratch that, be more open to all people. Lots of these guys are nerdy introverts, but are really cool when you get to know them.\n\nAs for the girls in CS, get used to it bud.\n\n### Comment ID dxh5qqk with +14 score by [(PetrichorBySulphur, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxh5qqk/) (in reply to ID dxfized):\nThanks for saying this.

I'm a mix of introvert and extrovert. I tend to be friendly, can hold a conversation well, and I'm interested in almost everything. To make matters worse, I'm a girl who is into fashion (I have a mean shoe collection), and other things generally not ascribed to CS people. I get along with everyone, but am not really close with most CS people because the similar interests just aren't there.\n\nI totally get your experience with CS kids not caring about anything but CS. For instance, one of our professors had us doing a multicultural day where we focused on programming tasks with a multicultural component. One kid decided to sit out because he 'didn't care about culture,' and took a 0 grade instead of participating. I frequently have to hear people sneer at any major that isn't STEM, and yet, when they have to engage in topics like politics, geography, or literature, the amount they don't know is simply astounding. I think it's just a cop out/ excuse when I hear them say those topics aren't challenging enough for them.\n\nI am lucky because I found a few people like me in CS who are pretty outgoing and socially balanced. I would say just try to make friends in your non-cs classes. It's okay if you just don't have the same interests as the CS kids. \n\nAlso didn't see you were from Brazil until I already wrote the above.

Still, there are always a few around who get in  having that passion (I've been in your place before, also thought there'd be more people with some experience - I'm very different from you on the rest though).

The most incredible software developers who I’ve ever worked with in my career were NOT the aspbergery-types you typically see in school and TV shows.

Management relies on the the devs who can communicate highly technical problems in a language without jargon and lingo so that they can make business decisions based on it. Larger dev teams rely on dev leads who have creativity and long-term vision to compose architectures for systems that will allow them to divide, conquer, and scale solutions for very large and complicated problem spaces. And sadly, the industry is actually sorely lacking many who can do both of those things well. Most devs in the industry right now are like most of your classmates: tightly clinging to the need to believe they are amazing at what they do because they need that to define their persona and value in society. As a result, they often never expand their knowledge beyond a single platform, language, or area of expertise, because outside of their niche, they would no longer be as good as they believe they are within their niche.\n\nOn the other hand, the relative few devs who are more creative and artistically-inclined spend their careers soaking up everything they can about every language and platform that sounds interesting to learn. Even if they never use that platform again in the future, they learn new ways of solving problems and new abstractions that apply to every platform and every language. The devs at my point in my career who have done this are nowadays typically the full-stack developers and, in fact, that's exactly what I do. I build servers in Java EE or Spring used by mobile client applications which I also build for Android and iOS. I learned all of those platforms and languages and many more on side projects long before I ever needed them in the workplace just because I love learning new things. Except for me and the other lead architect on the project, all other devs only work on one of our codebases because they never bothered to and don't want to learn any of the others. Being an \"Android Developer\" or an \"iOS Developer\" or a \"server-side developer\" is what defines them.\n\nSo that would be the best advice that I could offer to you. Don't settle for a niche like you'll see so many others do in your career. Never stop learning. Always be thirsty for more. If you can't think of a reason to learn something new that you're interested in, create a side project that opens the door on that reason. And don't let your career or your niche define who you are. As someone in the industry different from many other developers, you can much more easily become much bigger than just a niche. For me, when people ask what I do for a living, I tell them, \"I write software\", not that \"I am a software developer\". Because it's not who I am. It's just what I do. Who I am is much bigger than just my job.\n\n## Comment ID dxfi3qe with +2 score by [(puppypink, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfi3qe/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\nI'm about as extroverted as you can get, and I agree it can be tough making friends in com sci courses! I think part of it, however, comes from self-imposed beliefs - a lot of coworkers I know seem social and fairly outgoing when we hang out, but said they didn't have friends as undergrads, because they were engineers, so they just stayed in their dorms and played video games. \nI'm minoring in studio art, and the students in those classes are more sociable during class, but I still didn't see them often outside of class until I started inviting them to events we were both interested in - gallery receptions, campus activities, even a movie we both wanted to see. Every friend you have was once a stranger, and it took one of you to reach out - it might as well be you! If you don't want to or don't feel you know any individual well enough, see about organizing a small weekend event, like a game tournament or code jam, and invite your whole class(es)! That way, you can get to know each other over something you all like, but can get to know them in a more casual environment.\nAlso, your views of your classmates sounds rather conceited. If you haven't made friends with many of these people, how do you know they don't have the same interests as you? How do you know their reasons for going into computer science? It seems like you're quick to label them all as \"typical anime-loving gamers\" despite sounding like you don't know most of them too well. Stop assuming things about your peers and just talk to them.

I'm not into designing and making games, or going into a cyber security field. I like AI, and Quantum. That being said something I love about CS is how everyone's this meme loving nerd. As a comp sci student you're basically the grunts of industry. The field is constantly evolving, because it's so new! This results in some level of animosity towards Lib. Arts students and the like. Some of their courses are a joke, ngl. That being said most people are artistically inclined in some way or the other. I like taking photos for example. I've worked with other Engineering people in research, and I have to say I can't mingle with them as easily. They often don't share a similar sense of humor. I think the most important thing about comp sci is balance. I looove coding up stuff, and I love looking at algorithms, and doing the math related to CS, but I also spend ample time looking at other sciences, and trying to apply what I learned there.\n\n## Comment ID dxh7ibf with +2 score by [(HelloHaiHey, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxh7ibf/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\nI’m sort of on the same boat but not quite?? I’m in my first year of college majoring in CS (obviously) but I cant really connect with people in my classes, specially since I’m one of two females in my current class. I think it’s mostly due to the fact that I decided I wanted to go into Computer Science in my last year of high school. \n\nMostly I’m pursuing computer science because I learned in my last year that I love coding. While I am getting introduced to the more technical aspect of things I know for a fact my major interest is programming languages and what I can do with them. I mean you can do so many amazing things with programming it amazes me. \n\nI honestly didnt really connect with some of my classmates until we were grouped together for a group project and then we got talking. But honestly I found my best friends to be people from outside my major. I was friendless until my second semester and I only became friends with people because I started getting involved with activities around the college. I also got a job at the college and managed to create a really strong bond with all the people I work with. It’s really amazing and we all have different majors so that’s even more reassuring.

Feels like basically every CS student fits the stereotype of spends all their time at home playing video games and watching anime with little to no interested in humanities, politics, philosophy, etc. It makes sense though why those kinds of people would gravitate towards CS. As someone who does have interests in philosophy and politics, I can't say that I'm really excelling in my STEM courses. I'm getting by but in humanities courses I actually excel. I primarily chose CS because I want to have the ability to make my dreams come to life and start my own business(es) and I think programming might be the best avenue to do that requiring the lowest amount of capital. I mean programming can basically allow you to make anything which is what it's attraction was to me.

I also  don't really understand why most people also think that it is strange that i take CS and often wonder why more people don't take it especially assuming that it is currently and will most likely remain as one of if not the most fruitful per-say  industries today with all of the future technological possibilities and also the fact that almost everyone in the worlds population has a computing device in the form of a mobile phone to a games console to a desktop pc.

      "# [An inspiration to classmates and community by Maria Lamarca Anderson on 2024-06-21](https://www.uwb.edu/news/2024/06/21/an-inspiration-to-classmates-and-community)\nIn May, UW Bothell senior Puneet Birk was awarded the Chancellor’s Medal, an award that recognizes graduating students who have inspired their peers and faculty by overcoming significant obstacles while completing their degree or certificate program.\n\n“I was in shock,” said Birk, a first-generation college student. “You always think about how other people feel when they win an award, but I was bringing this home to my house. It felt surreal.”\n\nRecipients of the Chancellor’s Medal are nominated by UW Bothell faculty, staff or fellow students, and those in this 20-year-old’s circle were unanimous: She’s been an inspiration to those around her through academic excellence, her resilience in the face of family hardship and her work as an influential student leader.\n\n“Puneet embodies the very essence of the Chancellor’s Medal — she’s an inspiration, overcoming profound personal challenges to not only succeed but also uplift those around her,” said Ahmed Mohamad, a senior majoring in Business Administration who served as ASUWB vice president.\n\nPushing for more\n\nBirk, who was a Running Start student, joined UW Bothell as a junior. She sought to challenge herself, taking a full load of classes and applying to become a legislative liaison for the Associated Students of the University of Washington Bothell. The student lobbyist position required her to temporarily relocate to Olympia and inspired her to declare her major in Law, Economics & Public Policy.\n\n“After working with the legislature and working with an entire team at a lobbying firm, I just fell in love with policy and the entire process of it,” said Birk. “Also, my dad is a businessman and I’ve seen him work with legal parties. It’s always interested me.”\n\nAside from her studies, Birk has held two part-time jobs as a student leader. In spring 2023, she became the youngest-ever elected president of the ASUWB. Meanwhile, she also served as president of the Washington Student Association, a student-led nonprofit organization that facilitates statewide student organizing and advocacy at colleges and universities.\n\n“For nearly two years, I’ve watched Puneet triumph as a student leader,” said Brittany Mayes, Birk’s adviser and associate director of Student Engagement & Activities. “As ASUWB liaison, she really trailblazed best lobby practices for her team members and advocated for her fellow students in Olympia. She took her role as president very seriously, too.”\n\nFostering student joy and inclusion\n\nBirk researched the feasibility of creating a “common hour” on campus when she served as ASUWB president. During this hour, the hope is that no classes will be scheduled so that students can have more time to engage with student clubs and enjoy their college experience. Over this summer quarter, the registrar’s office will begin analyzing how this blocked hour can be effectively implemented.\n\nTo deepen student representation and to establish more checks and balances for the ASUWB team, Birk helped build up a student senate after it was dismantled during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“With our growing population, I realized we were a team often trying our best to represent nearly 6,000 students. It’s just not an equitable representation of all the demographics. There are just not physically enough hands,” Birk said. “So, our vice president, our policy and personnel coordinator and I — each of us — did a lot of work on creating the bylaws and structure for recreating a student senate.”\n\nBirk also worked to help improve campus safety and expand food options in the new campus dining hall.\n\n“Her presidency was about creating a more engaged, inclusive and supportive campus community,” said Mohamad. “She wanted every student to feel seen, heard and valued.”\n\nMeeting hardship with grace\n\nEven as she’s triumphed as a student and a student leader, Birk has faced some personal challenges. When she started at UW Bothell, her mother was dealing with a series of critical health issues that forced Birk to take on more responsibilities at home.\n\n“The biggest challenge was navigating my mom’s mental health, especially because mental health is a completely different thing for her generation,” Birk said. “My caretaking involved trying to explain what these challenges can look like, such as what anxiety truly is. So, I was not only trying to make sure that everybody was on the same page of how we could help mom get better but also ensuring that we were actively helping her to get better.”\n\nThen, in April 2023, Birk lost her “Big Dad,” her beloved grandfather who was a fixture of their family and of their larger Sikh and Punjabi communities.\n\n“He practically raised us. I feel losing him really opened my eyes to grief, and it also brought me closer to my religion” she said. “But it was a lot, and as a student, the homework never stops, so I really had to push through.”\n\nBirk has not only overcome, but she has excelled. She made the dean’s list this year and has continued to stay involved with numerous school clubs and mentor fellow ASUWB members.\n\n“The loss she endured could have dimmed any spirit, but Puneet’s resolve only grew stronger,” said Mohamad.\n\nHer presidency was about creating a more engaged, inclusive and supportive campus community. She wanted every student to feel seen, heard and valued.\n\nAhmed Mohamad, senior, Business Adminstration\n\nA bright future\n\nBirk graduated in June with her bachelor’s degree, and she is looking forward to law school. She’s currently studying for the Law School Admission Test, which she will take later this year. She hopes to attend the University of California, Los Angeles, or University of California, Berkeley, (or perhaps an Ivy League school) and eventually practice corporate law.\n\nDuring UW Bothell’s Commencement ceremony at T-Mobile Park, Birk was recognized by Chancellor Esterberg as recipient of the 2024 Chancellor’s Medal and, as ASUWB president, gave her final speech to her classmates.\n\nHer remarks centered around her beloved grandpa’s mantra, “kush roh.” This means “stay happy,” in Punjabi, Birk explained. “It’s a reminder to embrace joy in every moment, regardless of life’s challenges and uncertainties.”\n\nWith her enthusiastic demeanor, compassionate leadership, enduring work ethic and deep devotion to family, Birk beautifully embodies her grandfather’s mantra — and the ethos behind one of UW Bothell’s most prestigious student awards.",

Edna Milanga ’21, MBA ’23, and her daughter attended Illinois State at the same time.\n\nAppears In Illinois State: Spring 2024\n\nOriginally from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Milanga started her academic journey at Heartland Community College, earning an associate degree and making her way through English as a second language classes before transferring to Illinois State to earn a bachelor’s degree in international business. Milanga later enrolled in Illinois State’s MBA program. Kazigwa wasn’t far behind, transferring to Illinois State for its computer networking and telecommunications program.\n\nTheir mother-daughter bond only grew when they became Illinois State classmates. Milanga and Kazigwa made time for each other during the week, meeting for meals and running errands together.\n\n“She was (on campus) early in the morning, and I would be there in the afternoon,” said Milanga. “Sometimes we would go for lunch in Watterson and have a good time. We went to the bookstore to order textbooks, and we went to a job fair together.”\n\nThey also used their experiences to help each other. Milanga guided her daughter through class scheduling. Kazigwa offered technology expertise in return.\n\n“We do homework together,” said Milanga. “She’s good with the computer, so when I’m stuck and frustrated, she helps me troubleshoot.”\n\nMilanga and Kazigwa said their unique experience brought them closer together.\n\n“We became closer friends. We shop together, do our nails together, watch shows together,” said Milanga. “She’s my BFF.”\n\nKazigwa walked across the same commencement stage as her mother last December.\n\nThis time, Milanga did the cheering.",
      "# [Former Classmates Turn Compassion into Action](https://hsdm.harvard.edu/news/former-classmates-turn-compassion-action)\n“It was fate that we met that day,” said Shahid Aziz, DMD96, of his first encounter with Jose Marchena during a class photo. “I completed my undergrad in three years, instead of the typical four. If it wasn’t for that we never would have met on those front steps of Harvard School of Dental Medicine (HSDM). I remember Jose was standing right in front of me when that photo was taken.”\n\nThat fateful moment for Aziz and classmate Jose Marchena, DMD96, MD98, sparked a brotherhood that has lasted 33 years. As predoctoral students, the two spent almost every day together taking the same classes and attending the same labs with their peers.\n\nThe Class of 1996 finished their degrees in five years, marking the last class to do so before returning to a four-year predoctoral program. The fifth year of the program was devoted to either conducting research, managing a public health project, or beginning specialty training.\n\n“My experience at HSDM was like no other. The faculty members were faithfully dedicated to the students, and they took a great deal of time and effort to foster a spirit of excellence among all of us,” said Marchena. “That close relationship allowed the faculty to closely monitor our progress and shape us into the type of practitioners we are today.”\n\nBoth Aziz and Marchena went on to pursue oral and maxillofacial surgery residencies after graduating from HSDM. Now, they have well-established careers in surgery and academic medicine, crediting their mentors at HSDM for opening the door into the world of academic oral surgery.\n\n“Having role models, such as Dean Donoff, Dr. Leonard Kaban, and Dr. Guralnick, as a dental student really inspired me to go into academia instead of private practice,” said Aziz. “I had a lot of great instructors, many of whom encouraged me to train in oral and maxillofacial surgery.”\n\nMarchena serves as an associate professor in the Bernard and Gloria Pepper Katz Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Dentistry. Aziz is the division director of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and professor of Otolaryngology at Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine.\n\nIn 2006, Aziz started the nonprofit organization, Smile Bangladesh—an organization dedicated to providing care to children and adults in Bangladesh with facial cleft deformities. The organization provides free treatment with the help of surgeons and nurses who volunteer their time and expertise.\n\n“My father was from Bangladesh. Before he passed away, he asked me to never forget where I came from and always try to help those less fortunate,” said Aziz. “During my residency with Dr. Steve Roser, DMD68, I had the chance to travel on surgical missions to South America, where he taught me how to run a humanitarian mission. In 2006, I had my first mission to Bangladesh and Smile Bangladesh was born!”\n\nTo date, the organization has treated nearly 2,000 children with cleft lip and palate deformities. After running Smile Bangladesh on his own for a few years, Aziz was looking for additional help to grow the organization. In 2011, he recruited Marchena to become vice president of Smile Bangladesh to expand upon the organization’s vision and effort. The same year Marchena went on his first mission trip.\n\n“That first trip is one I’ll never forget,” Marchena said. “I realized how important patient care really is. It’s just you and the patient. I’ll never forget the look on the parents’ faces after their child has been taken care of.”\n\nNow in its eighteenth year, they don’t plan to slow down anytime soon. Twice a year the team travels to Bangladesh to provide free cleft lip and palate repairs to children in need. Many of the surgeons and residents who join are HSDM graduates, including Gregory Borah, DMD76, MD76, PD81, who also serves on the board of Smile Bangladesh.\n\n“My experience with Smile Bangladesh continuously reminds me of the primary purpose of choosing a healthcare profession. It brings like-minded people together and touches the lives of doctors, residents, students, and patients alike,” said Marchena.\n\nThere is also an educational component to the organization. Aziz and Marchena have traveled all over the globe, lecturing on a wide range of oral surgery topics. Their ongoing commitment to making a difference in the lives of their patients has led the pair to receive recognition for their work with the organization. In 2017, Aziz received the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) Humanitarian Award. Marchena was honored with the same award in 2023.\n\nAziz hopes that in the future, they can develop a devoted team and center in Bangladesh to provide educational training for local surgeons and alleviate the wait time for patients needing critical care.\n\n“The whole organization is a labor of love. I never would have predicted that first interaction on the steps would lead me, lead us, to the path we are on today,” said Aziz. “I’m so thankful to HSDM for bringing us together.”",

      "# [Prince William Co. student helps dozens of eligible classmates register to vote by Scott Gelman on 2024-11-05](https://wtop.com/prince-william-county/2024/11/prince-william-co-senior-helps-dozens-of-eligible-classmates-register-to-vote/)\nShe’s always been interested in public policy and criminal justice and in between college applications and schoolwork, she considered ways she may be able to help other students register to vote for the first time, too.\n\nSo, Nowell-Shortt asked the guidance counselors at the Prince William County school how many of her classmates would be eligible to vote by Election Day. She learned it would be about 100.\n\nEarlier this fall, Nowell-Shortt launched a voter-registration drive during the school’s lunch periods for a whole week. Seventy-two people approached the table to register, she said.\n\n“It’s really nice that we can start a civic engagement,” Nowell-Shortt said. “So not only is it important that we vote (in) this election, but if we encourage young voters to vote this election, then in the future elections to come, they will also be present.”\n\nDuring that week in September, Nowell-Shortt made sure she did enough research to talk about the process and have meaningful conversations. They weren’t partisan, she said, and other students joined her efforts to empower their peers to register if eligible.\n\nIt’s something that few students had even considered as a possibility, she said.\n\nMore Local Election News\n\n“A lot of students really didn’t even know that they were eligible to vote,” she said.\n\nNowell-Shortt’s mom is a permanent resident of the U.S. but isn’t eligible to vote. So, she wanted to ensure that her classmates understood the impact of voting.\n\nNowell-Shortt plans on filling out her first ballot in person on Election Day, and will do so with her older brother, who is also voting in his first election.\n\n“This will increase the political influence of our future to come,” she said. “I think with the younger generation being able to vote, like myself, we’re definitely going to help make an impact in our future.”\n\nGet breaking news and daily headlines delivered to your email inbox by signing up here.\n\n© 2024 WTOP.

      "# [Ex-Indiana teacher accused of encouraging classmates to beat up 7-year-old with disabilities by Austin Mullen, Antonio Planas on 2024-04-19](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ex-indiana-teacher-accused-encouraging-classmates-beat-7-year-old-disa-rcna148469)\nA former teacher in Indiana is accused of orchestrating a “Fight Club” in which he allegedly encouraged classmates to beat up a 7-year-old student with disabilities and videotaping at least one assault, according to a lawsuit filed this week.\n\nThe 7-year-old boy's mother filed a lawsuit Tuesday in Marion County that also names Indiana Public Schools Superintendent Aleesia Johnson, George Washington Carver Montessori IPS School 87 Principal Mary Kapcoe and the child’s former teacher Julious Johnican.\n\nOther defendants include the district, the district’s Board of School Commissioners, the school’s assistant principal, a substitute teacher and a behavioral consultant.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, weeks into the 2023-24 school year, the child, who is identified only as \"O.D.,\" began complaining to his mother about being abused and harassed at school.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnican orchestrated “a reprehensible ‘fight club’ type of discipline within his classroom over a span of three months in which he encouraged, instigated, and on at least one occasion recorded on his phone physical abuse of O.D. by other students.”\n\n“In this horrifying setup, Johnican not only permitted but incited and facilitated other students to engage in acts of violence against seven-year-old O.D., which included at least three beatings and various forms of physical harm and bullying both for his own amusement or as a deeply disturbed disciplinary measure,\" the suit says.\n\nCatherine Michael, an attorney representing the student’s family, said the teacher appeared to be using the fighting as “a disciplinary technique.”\n\n“Instead of beating a child senselessly himself, at least according to what we have, he was allowing another child to do it,” Michael told NBC affiliate WTHR of Indianapolis.\n\nOn Thursday, a spokesperson for the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said that on Wednesday it opened an investigation into the allegations in the lawsuit at the request of the county’s prosecutor’s office.\n\nThe school district said in a statement that it took immediate actions once it learned of the allegations. It also said the teacher was initially suspended and then resigned on Nov. 2, before the district could begin termination proceedings.\n\n“IPS does not tolerate the type of behavior alleged in the complaint and takes reports of potential abuse and neglect seriously,” the district's statement said. “When IPS learned of the teacher’s conduct, the Department of Child Services (DCS) was immediately notified, and the teacher was removed from the classroom and suspended. The teacher had no further contact with students and is no longer employed by IPS.”\n\nThe district also said it was not made aware of the allegations the teacher encouraged fights until the parent emailed the principal on the evening of Oct. 30. But the principal did not see the email until the next morning and immediately contacted the Department of Child Services and the school system’s human resources personnel, the district said.\n\nA spokesperson for the district said Thursday that Johnson, the superintendent, and the school principal would not comment on the allegations.\n\nAttempts to reach Johnican, who is described as a first-year teacher in the district in the suit, were unsuccessful Thursday afternoon. Phone calls to numbers associated with his relatives were not answered.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the second grader was “thrown to the ground, struck, slapped, and hit in the head repeatedly\" in at least three attacks.\n\nJohnican, the suit says, held the child on two occasions while “allowing other students to punch, hit and kick him.”\n\nThe child’s mother had repeated meetings with Johnican to discuss her son’s allegations, but Johnican dismissed them and attributed the problem to the student’s behavioral issues and said the student was lying or mentally ill, the lawsuit says.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, on Sept. 22, the child’s mother told the vice principal of the allegations after she was called to the school because her son was hysterical and unable to calm down.\n\nHis mother went to the school that day and observed him in the classroom for 45 minutes. That day, her son again told her he was being abused in school, the suit says.\n\n“O.D. informed his mother that in the teacher’s presence and by his direction that another student had slammed his head down on a desk, pulled him to the floor, and then hit him repeatedly in the head. He directly indicated this was being done at the instruction of his teacher Mr. Johnican,” the lawsuit said.\n\nThe child, according to the suit, began asking to avoid school, and his grades slipped.\n\nOn Nov. 1, his parents had a meeting with Johnican, who intended to show a video of his classroom’s environment but instead inadvertently began showing a video of the student being attacked, the suit says.\n\n“When the parent attempted to grab the phone, he inadvertently turned up the volume where the parents could hear that it was him, the teacher, instigating and encouraging the beating of their disabled seven-year-old child,” according to the lawsuit.\n\n“The distressing content of the video made by Johnican shows O.D. on the floor crying as he is repeatedly punched in the face and head by a peer who is sitting on top of him as he cries out and begs for the attack to cease,\" it says.\n\nIn an interview with the Department of Child Services, the student said that he was assaulted twice in October and that Johnican held him down in one instance while a first grader slapped his face, according to the suit. And in a second alleged incident, Johnican held his shoulders while another student punched him in the stomach and kicked him in his legs, the suit said.\n\nSome of the claims in the lawsuit include negligent care and supervision; negligent hiring, retention and supervision; and intentional infliction of serious emotional distress.\n\nThe child is now homeschooled, he has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and he is in therapy at least once a week, the lawsuit said.\n\nThe suit requests a jury trial and says damages will be determined at trial.",
      "# [Why Thomas Matthew Crooks tried to assassinate Donald Trump is a mystery to investigators and his ex-classmates by Ryan W. Briggs, Max Marin, Ellie Rushing on 2024-07-14](https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania/thomas-matthew-crooks-trump-shooting-bethel-park-20240714.html)\nBETHEL PARK, Pa. — In the sea of caps and gowns, Thomas Matthew Crooks hardly stood out.\n\nFew people clapped when his name was called. A YouTube video of his graduation two years ago from Bethel Park High School shows a slender and bespectacled student receiving his diploma with a soft smile.\n\nBut the class of 2022 awoke Sunday to learn that the 20-year-old Allegheny County man was notorious, the shooter in the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump during a rally that left an ex-firefighter, Corey Comperatore, dead and two other attendees wounded.\n\nU.S. Secret Service counter-snipers killed Crooks moments after he opened fire on the Saturday night rally from a nearby rooftop. The FBI said Sunday they believed he acted alone. He had not been on the bureau’s radar.\n\n» READ MORE: FBI probing motives, background of Thomas Matthew Crooks, the Western Pa. gunman behind Donald Trump assassination attempt\n\nCrooks’ actions shocked residents in his hometown, sparked countless conspiracy theories online, and prompted investigators to begin combing through every aspect of his life, looking for motive.\n\nThe mystery has been fueled by a near-total absence of Crooks’ social media postings, political writings, or other digital fingerprints.\n\nSeveral former classmates appeared on national television Sunday, quickly casting Crooks as a stereotypical loner who was bullied heavily during his time at Bethel Park. One of them, Jason Kohler, told reporters Sunday that students tormented Crooks “almost every day” and that he often wore “hunting” outfits to class.\n\n“He was just an outcast,” Kohler said, “and you know how kids are nowadays.”\n\nYet, two former students interviewed by The Inquirer disputed the characterization.\n\nThey did not recall specific incidents of violence or other antagonism involving their now-infamous classmate in the community they described as generally tight-knit.\n\nMark Sigafoos remembered Crooks as the quiet but friendly kid he shared two classes with at Bethel Park.\n\n“He was very kind,” Sigafoos said Sunday, by phone. “He was a nerdy kid, but I don’t think he was as harshly bullied as some people are saying. He never wore trench coats or anything of the sort to school.”\n\nA Tribune-Review article from Bethel Park’s June 2022 graduation credited Crooks with earning an academic award, for math and science. And Sigafoos said that when he didn’t understand the course material, Crooks was someone he turned to for help.\n\nThe thought that the mild-mannered student would try to kill former President Trump was difficult to process.\n\n“I feel like this is one of those things that you wouldn’t expect from him,” Sigafoos said. “No one that I know said they ever found him to be a creepy, loner kind of guy.”\n\n» READ MORE: Conspiracy theories spread wildly online after Trump shooting\n\nFBI investigators found materials for two explosive devices in Crooks’ car, according to the New York Times. Police on Sunday restricted public access to the gunman’s home in Bethel Park, nestled in a middle-class suburb eight miles south of Pittsburgh.\n\nThe slight traces of public information Crooks left behind leave few clues about his political ideology.\n\nFederal campaign finance records show he made a $15 donation to progressive political action committee in 2021 after President Joe Biden’s election, but later registered as a Republican, according to Pennsylvania voter data. His father was a registered Libertarian, his mother a Democrat.\n\nCrooks’ body was found on the rooftop of an agricultural tool manufacturing plant a few hundred feet from the rally with an AR-style semiautomatic rifle — legally purchased by his father. The shooter was wearing a T-shirt promoting “The Demolition Ranch,” a YouTube channel for gun enthusiasts.\n\n» READ MORE: What we know about the deadly shooting at the Trump rally in Butler, Pa.\n\nIf Crooks maintained any personal social media presence, it went largely undetected on Sunday. Discord, an instant messaging platform mainly used by video gamers, released a statement acknowledging Crooks held a “rarely utilized” account that contained no information relevant to the shooting.\n\nSigafoos did not recall Crooks making political overtures in class, but rather as someone interested in how government works, and “not trying to insert his own beliefs into it.”\n\nAnother former classmate did not share this view.\n\nMax R. Smith recalled taking an American history course with Crooks as a sophomore. He did recall Crooks making political statements — but they shed no light on his actions Saturday.\n\n“He definitely was conservative,” he said. “It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate.”\n\nSmith recalled a mock debate in which their history professor posed government policy questions and asked students to stand on one side of the classroom or the other to signal their support or opposition for a given proposal.\n\n“The majority of the class were on the liberal side, but Tom, no matter what, always stood his ground on the conservative side,” Smith said. “That’s still the picture I have of him. Just standing alone on one side while the rest of the class was on the other.”\n\nThe former classmate also recalled Crooks as generally kind and intelligent, if reserved.\n\n“Everybody is in shock,” Smith said. “He was so quiet, I wouldn’t imagine him doing that. But I guess that was the same deal with Columbine.”\n\n“Shocked would be an understatement,” Sigafoos added. “None of my friends can fathom that a dude we knew would try and kill Trump.”\n\n» READ MORE: Corey Comperatore identified as man killed in Trump rally shooting\n\nBethel Park High School said it would comply with investigators. On Sunday, the sprawling school campus was quiet, emptied for the summer, save for a police car parked in front of the main building.\n\nCrooks’ career arc since high school is also not entirely clear. Crooks listed himself as unemployed in 2020, but most recently worked as a dietary aide at Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, a state-licensed transitional care facility.\n\nAnd there too, his employer saw no cause for concern. Marcie Grimm, the center’s administrator, said in a statement Sunday that the facility was complying with federal investigators.\n\n“We are shocked and saddened to learn of his involvement as Thomas Matthew Crooks performed his job without concern and his background check was clean,” Grimm said.\n\n» READ MORE: GOP delegates from Pa. prepare to give Trump a ‘hero’s welcome’ in Milwaukee\n\nHe graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County two months ago, earning an associate degree in engineering science, school officials said in a statement to the New York Times, saying they were “shocked and saddened by the horrific turn of events.”\n\nRelatives of Crooks could not be immediately reached.\n\nBy Sunday afternoon, police had cordoned off surrounding roads that lead to the home of Crooks’ parents in the Hill Crest neighborhood of Bethel Park, with closed road signs dotting the street and a traffic attendant waving cars to a detour. The residence was surrounded by law enforcement and federal agents.\n\nAbout 45 minutes south of Butler, at the home of one of his relatives in the town of Allison Park, no one answered the door, adorned with a pastel-colored wreath.",
      "# [Psych News Alert: Teens With Classmates Diagnosed With Mental Illness More Likely To Be Diagnosed Themselves by Psychiatric News Alert](https://alert.psychnews.org/2024/05/teens-with-classmates-diagnosed-with.html)\nTeens who have one or more classmates with a mental disorder are more likely to be diagnosed with one themselves later in life than those who do not have any classmates with a mental disorder, according to a report in JAMA Psychiatry. The risk of a mental illness diagnosis was greatest in the first year following the diagnosis of a classmate.\n\nBeing exposed to a peer with a mental disorder may aid in “normalization of mental disorders through increased awareness and receptivity to diagnosis and treatment,” wrote Jussi Alho, Ph.D., of the University of Helsinki, Finland, and colleagues. “Similarly, having individuals with no diagnosis in the peer network might discourage seeking help for any underlying mental health problems.”\n\nAlho and colleagues used Finnish national health and school registries to examine mental disorder diagnoses among more than 700,000 individuals born between 1985 and 1997. The cohort was followed from August 1 of the ninth grade (approximately age 16) until a diagnosis of mental disorder, emigration, death, or December 31, 2019. The researchers adjusted findings to control for a wide range of variables that might affect diagnosis—parental educational level, income, and mental health; area-level education, employment, and urbanicity; and school and class size.\n\nAmong the cohort, 47,433 individuals had a mental disorder diagnosis by the ninth grade. Of the remaining cohort members, 167,227 (25.1%) received a mental disorder diagnosis during the follow-up. There was no increased risk of a mental disorder diagnosis among teens with one diagnosed classmate across the whole follow-up, but a 5% increase with more than one diagnosed classmate.\n\nDuring the first year of follow-up, teens with one diagnosed classmate had a 9% increased risk of a mental disorder diagnosis, while teens with multiple diagnosed classmates had an 18% increased risk. Mood, anxiety, and eating disorders were the most common diagnoses following exposure.\n\nAlho and colleagues wrote that the heightened risk early in follow-up “challenges the likelihood of harmful contagion occurring without an already existing, undiagnosed disorder,” but acknowledged that for some diagnoses such as eating disorders, transmission could also occur through peer social influence.\n\n“Prevention and intervention measures that consider potential peer influences on early-life mental health could substantially reduce the disease burden of mental disorders in society,” the researchers concluded.\n\nFor related information see the Psychiatric News article, “Teen ‘Social Media Induced’ Illness Requires Careful Workups.”\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStock/Caiaimage/ArtemisDiana)\n\nDon't miss out!

So I was really excited about just having my class be part of where I'm heading next, you know?\" the Arkansas boy told \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nLuke's May 14 adoption was the culmination of months of bonding, a process he and his parents, Cassie and Bradley Kissinger, said was nearly instantaneous after they first met at a \"connection event\" hosted by Project Zero, an Arkansas nonprofit dedicated to promoting adoption.\n\n\"We started playing games at the event and those events can be a little awkward but it was actually not at all with [Luke],\" Cassie Kissinger recalled. \"I just kind of jumped in and started helping him with things and we walked around and we talked a lot. We got lunch together. So all the awkwardness went away really quickly.\"\n\nFor Cassie Kissinger, adopting Luke has been a longtime dream come true.\n\n\"I grew up in a family that fostered and adopted out of foster care. So I always wanted to do that. That was a dream of mine since I was a teenager,\" she told \"GMA.\"\n\nOn his adoption day, Luke said he was nervous, excited and overall, felt \"all the feelings combined.\"\n\n\"It was really fun but we had emotional parts too,\" he said.\n\nNow, the rising fifth grader calls Cassie and Bradley Kissinger mom and dad and also has a brother Aiden, also 11, and an older sister Alena, 14.\n\nAiden told \"GMA\" \"it's pretty exciting\" to welcome a brother into the Kissinger family fold.\n\n\"I mean, it gets annoying like other siblings, but we get along pretty well,\" he said, adding that he particularly enjoys playing video games with Luke or playing outside together in their backyard.\n\nThe Kissingers say for other families considering adoption, it's a journey that's well worth it.\n\n\"The kids don't want perfect. They don't need perfect. They just need someone to love them,\" Cassie Kissinger said. \"A lot of these kids have been waiting many years in foster care to be adopted and find a permanent family and it can truly change the trajectory of their life if they find that permanency.\"\n\n\"If you actually look at the statistics, the number of kids out there that just need some love is staggering. It's ridiculously high and I mean if you can be a part of changing even one of those kids' lives, go for it. Don't hold back,\" Bradley Kissinger added.",
      "# [Schools face a new threat: \"nudify\" sites that use AI to create realistic, revealing images of classmates by Anderson Cooper on 2024-12-15](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/schools-face-new-threat-nudify-sites-use-ai-create-realistic-revealing-images-60-minutes-transcript/)\nIn October last year, a 14-year-old girl named Francesca Mani was sitting in her high school history class when she heard a rumor that some boys had naked photos of female classmates. She soon learned her picture was among them, but the images were doctored - created with artificial intelligence using what's known as a \"nudify\" website or app, which turns real photos of someone fully clothed into real-looking nudes. We've found nearly 30 similar incidents in schools in the U.S. over the last 20 months and plenty more around the world. We want to warn you, some of what you'll hear - and see - is disturbing, but we think unveiling these \"nudify\" websites is important. In part because they're not hidden on the dark web, they are openly advertised, easy to use, and as Francesca Mani found out there isn't much that's been done to stop them.\n\nAnderson Cooper: When you first heard the rumor, you didn't know that there were photos-- or-- or a photo of you?\n\nFrancesca Mani: No. We didn't know. I think that was like the most chaotic day I've ever witnessed.\n\nAnderson Cooper: In a school, somebody gets an inkling of something, and it just spreads.\n\nFrancesca Mani: It's like rapid fire. It just goes through everyone. And so then when someone hears-- hears this, it's like, \"Wait. Like, AI?\" Like, no one thinks that could, like, happen to you.\n\nFrancesca Mani knew nothing about \"nudify\" websites when she discovered she and several other girls at Westfield High School in New Jersey had been targeted. According to a lawsuit later filed by one of the other girls through her parents, a boy at the school uploaded photos from Instagram to a site called Clothoff. We are naming the site to raise awareness of its potential dangers.\n\nThere are more than a hundred of these \"nudify\" websites - a quick search is all it takes to find them. Clothoff is one of the most popular, with more than 3 million visits last month, according to Graphika, a company that analyzes social networks. It now offers to \"nudify\" males as well - but female nudes are far more popular. \"Have someone to undress?\" Clothoff's website asks. You can upload a photo - or get a free demonstration, in which an image of a woman appears with clothes on, then a few seconds later, her clothes are gone. We are blurring it out but the results look very real.\n\nFrancesca Mani never saw what had been done to her photo, but according to that lawsuit at least one girl's AI nude was shared on Snapchat and seen by several kids at school. What made it worse, Francesca says, is that she and the other girls found out they were the victims, when they were called by name to the principal's office over the school's public address system.\n\nFrancesca Mani: I feel like that was a major violation of our privacy while, like, the bad actors were taken out of their classes privately. When I left the principal's office, I was walking through a hallway, and I saw these group of boys laughing at these group of girls crying. And that's when I realized I should stop crying and be mad, because this is unacceptable.\n\nThat afternoon, Westfield's principal sent this email to all high school parents, informing them \"some of our students had used artificial intelligence to create pornographic images from original photos.\" The principal also said the school was investigating and \"at this time we believe that any created images have been deleted and are not being circulated.\"\n\nFrancesca's mom Dorota, who's also an educator, was not convinced.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Do you think they did enough?\n\nDorota Mani: Well, I don't know, Anderson. You work in television. Is anything deleted in the digital world?\n\nAnderson Cooper: You feel like even if somebody deletes something somewhere, who knows where these images may be?\n\nDorota Mani: Who printed? Who screenshotted? Who downloaded? You can't really wipe it out.\n\nDorota says she filed a police report, but no charges have been brought. She was shocked by the school's handling of the whole incident.\n\nDorota Mani: The principal informed me that one boy receives one-day suspension, and that was it. So I ask her if this is all. Are there gonna be any other consequences? And she said, \"No, that's-- for now, this is all that is going to happen.\"\n\nThe school district wouldn't confirm details about the photos, the students involved, or any disciplinary action. In a statement to 60 Minutes, the school superintendent said the district revised its Harassment, Intimidation and Bullying policy to incorporate AI — something the Manis said they spent months urging school officials to do.\n\nAnderson Cooper: You feel like the girls paid a bigger cost in the end-\n\nFrancesca Mani: Yeah, they did.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Than the boy or boys–\n\nFrancesca Mani: Yeah.\n\nAnderson Cooper: – who were involved in this did?\n\nFrancesca Mani: Because they just have to live with knowing that maybe an image is floating, their image is floating around the internet. And they just have to deal with what the boys did.\n\nKolina Koltai has been looking into Clothoff and other \"nudify\" sites for more than a year. She's a senior researcher who specializes in the misuse of AI at Bellingcat, an international investigative group.\n\nAnderson Cooper: This site, as soon as you get there, it says, you have to be 18 or over to use the website. You can't use others' photos without their permission. You can't use pictures of people who are under 18. Is there any way for them to actually check if you're–\n\nKolina Koltai: No.\n\nAnderson Cooper: --under 18 or over 18?\n\nKolina Koltai: You'll see, as we click accept, that there's no verification. And now we're already here.\n\nAnderson Cooper: And immediately, you're getting very explicit photos.\n\nKolina Koltai: And then they have the poses feature, which is one of their new settings, which is the different sex poses, which is the premium feature.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Wow. So, Wow.\n\nKolina Koltai: This is the preview. We haven't…\n\nClothoff and other \"nudify\" sites encourage customers to promote their services on social media, and users often show off their favorite before and after AI nudes.\n\nKolina Koltai: I've even seen on social media platforms people showing before and after photos of what are clearly, like, high school girls. And I've, like, reverse image searched the original photo. And they're, like, a high school girl's, like, swim meet. You'll see these are very clearly, these are minors, and adult content is being made of them nonconsensually, then also being posted on social media.\n\nAnderson Cooper: I think a lotta parents would be surprised to learn that you post a picture of your child on your Instagram account--your child could end up-- a naked photo of your child out there.\n\nKolina Koltai: Yeah. And so you have a registration…\n\nTo \"nudify\" a photo on Clothoff is free… the first time. After that it costs from $2 to $40. The payment options often change, but there are always plenty to choose from.\n\nKolina Koltai: It's giving me everything from crypto using a credit card for a variety of different credit cards. We got PayPal here. Google Pay.\n\nAnderson Cooper: I would imagine, some of these companies are not thrilled that their services are being used by these websites.\n\nKolina Koltai: Yeah. And in many of these cases, it directly violates their policies.\n\nTo trick online payment services, Kolina Koltai says, Clothoff and other \"nudify\" sites, redirect their customers' payments through phony websites like these pretending to sell flowers and photography lessons.\n\nKolina Koltai: Say, for example, you want to pay through PayPal. So we click this, and it'll take a second. So it's now redirecting you.\n\nAnderson Cooper: It's redirecting through a dummy–\n\nKolina Koltai: A dummy website.\n\nAnderson Cooper: --website.\n\nKolina Koltai: So that way, on PayPal's end, it looks like you may be purchasing anything from--motorcycles or bee-keeping lessons or Rollerblade lessons. And so now we got to a PayPal screen. But we can see down here it says, \"Cancel and return to innernookdesigns.motorcycles.\"\n\nAnderson Cooper: So that's what PayPal is being told is the website that's asking for the-- the charge.\n\nKolina Koltai: Yes.\n\nPayPal told us it banned Clothoff from its platforms a year ago and shuts down the accounts for these redirect sites when it finds them. The problem is Clothoff often just creates new ones.\n\nAnd that's not the only deception it relies on. Its website lists a name, Grupo Digital - with an address in Buenos Aires, Argentina, implying that's where Clothoff is based, but when we sent our cameras, there was no Grupo Digital there. It turned out to be the office of a YouTube channel that covers politics and when we knocked on the door…\n\n…the employee who answered said she never heard of Clothoff.\n\nEmployee (in Spanish): No, no, no, no, we don't do that, we're not that company.\n\nClothoff also made up a fake CEO, according to Kolina Koltai, complete with what she says is an AI-generated headshot.\n\nKolina Koltai: There is a really inherent shadiness that's happening. They're not being transparent about who owns it. They're obviously trying to mask their payments. But you look at the sophistication of these really large sites, it's completely different than say some guy in a basement that set up a site that he's trying to do it on his own. When these sites launched, and the way that they've been developing and going this past year, it is not someone's first rodeo. It's not the first time they set up a complex network.\n\nClothoff claims on its website that: \"processing of minors is impossible.\" We emailed what the site says is a press contact, asking for any evidence of that and to respond to a number of other questions. We didn't hear back.\n\nYiota Souras: A lot of people might say, \"Well, these images are fake.\" But we know victims will suffer-- humiliation. They'll suffer-- you know, mental health distress and-- and reputational harm. In a school setting it's really amplified, because one of their peers has created this imagery. So there's a loss of confidence. A loss of trust.\n\nYiota Souras is chief legal officer at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Her organization regularly works with tech companies to flag inappropriate content on their sites.\n\nAnderson Cooper: In at least three cases Snapchat was reportedly used to circulate these photos. In one instance a parent told us that it took more than eight months to get the accounts that had shared the images taken down.\n\nYiota Souras: Their responsiveness to-- to victims, that is a recurring problem that we see across tech companies.\n\nAnderson Cooper: So it's not as-- it's not as easy as a parent–\n\nYiota Souras: No.\n\nAnderson Cooper: --sending a note through Snapchat, \"Hey-- this is happening. My child has been exploited.\"\n\nYiota Souras: No. It's-- it's entirely unclear why it is not a faster process. We can actually notify tech companies as well and ask them to take that content down. Anderson Cooper: And in your experience do they?\n\nYiota Souras: Much faster than when an individual calls. Yes. That isn't the way it should be. Right? I mean a parent whose child has exploitative or child pornography images online should not have to rely on reaching out to a third party, and having them call the tech company. The tech company should be assuming responsibility immediately to remove that content.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Why are they not doing that?\n\nYiota Souras: Because I do not think there are ramifications to them not doing so.\n\nSocial media companies are shielded from lawsuits involving photos someone posts online due to what Yiota Souras considers an outdated law.\n\nYiota Souras: Under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law from 1996, so very different world back then. Online platforms have near complete immunity for any liability arising from content that a user puts on their system. The section 230 protection is really what, allows this very loose ecosystem to exist in terms of \"nudify\" apps and websites that cause harm to children.\n\nWe asked Snapchat about that parent who told us the company didn't respond to her for eight months. A Snapchat spokesperson told us they've been unable to locate her request and said in part: \"We have efficient mechanisms for reporting this kind of content,\" and added \"We have a zero-tolerance policy for such content\" and \"...act quickly to address it once reported.\"\n\nAI nudes of minors are illegal under federal child pornography laws, according to the Department of Justice, if they depict what's defined as \"sexually explicit conduct.\" But Souras is concerned some images created by \"nudify\" sites may not meet that definition.\n\nYiota Souras: There is this gap in the law around a \"nudify\" app that desperately needs to be shut.\n\nAnderson Cooper: What are the gaps in the law?\n\nYiota Souras: Currently a nude image of a child that does not include sexually explicit conduct is not illegal. And that is a serious gap that exists for real children and that exists certainly for images of nude children that are created by a \"nudify\" app.\n\nNats- Francesca Mani Speaking at Encode Justice event: Send a clear message that what the boys had done…\n\nIn the year since Francesca Mani found out she was targeted, she and her mom have urged schools to implement policies around AI and worked with members of Congress to try and pass a number of federal bills.\n\nThe Take It Down Act, co-sponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz and Amy Klobuchar, made it through the Senate this month and is now awaiting a vote in the House. It would create criminal penalties for sharing AI nudes and require social media companies to take photos down within 48 hours of getting a request.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Schools don't really know how to address this. Police in many cases don't do much at this stage. And the sites are making, I presume, millions of dollars off this. So can it be fixed?\n\nYiota Souras: Absolutely. If we have the appropriate laws we will have the criminal consequences, first of all to deter offenders, and then they'll be held liable if they are still using these apps. We would have civil remedies for victims. Schools would have protocols. Investigators and law enforcement would have roadmaps on how to investigate. What charges to bring. But we're a long way from that. We just need the laws in place. All the rest will come from that.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, contact the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children at 1-800-THE-LOST or www.ncmec.org.\n\nProduced by Nichole Marks and John Gallen.

      "# [Long Lost UNOH Classmates Reconnect by UNOH News Center](https://news.unoh.edu/2024/08/Long%20Lost%20UNOH%20Classmates%20Reconnect.html)\nPosted on Sunday, August 18, 2024\n\nWritten by Contributing Columnist Melanie Barnas-Simmons\n\nAlumni from the 80’s and 90’s didn’t have social media to keep them connected the way UNOH graduates do today. Andy Casperson of Norton Shores, MI was one of them. Andy graduated with his Automotive Diesel Technician Degree in late 1986. He started out working at dealerships and private auto shops, then became a master mechanic managing a fleet. After 12 years, he decided to make a career change and became a firefighter. His knowledge of mechanics came in handy working on the fleet of fire trucks. After retiring in 2022, he started thinking how great it would be to reconnect with some of his college classmates.\n\nThe UNOH Alumni Relations Department was able to reach out on his behalf and get Andy in touch with old friends he met during an Aerobics class on campus. Kendra Thatcher Heckman of Decatur, IN, and Karla Linn Erman of Delphos, OH. were thrilled to hear from their old volleyball and bowling buddy.\n\nThe three recently met up on the family farm where Kendra and her husband live. Andy and his wife camped for the night on their way to Eldora Speedway.\n\nKendra said, “At first, I was worried about what we would talk about as it’s been so long since we’ve seen each other, but once we got going, it was just like old times.”\n\nKendra and Karla both studied in the medical administrative assistant program at what was then called Northwestern College. Kendra worked for St. Rita’s before graduating and landed a job closer to home at Bluffton Regional Medical Center. She has been there ever since, working in a secretarial role in the outpatient therapy department.\n\nKarla’s first job after college was actually with UNOH in the career placement center. From there, she went to Graybar Electric in Lima in a customer service role. After ten years in that position, she moved to Kindred Healthcare as a staff coordinator. After 20 years in that role, she returned to Graybar, where she is today.\n\nThe three look forward to the next time they can get together and perhaps expand their group to include a few more old friends.\n\n“It was great for me to see how well each is doing and how their families are growing.” Explained Andy. “I am confident we will keep in touch and get together at least once a year or more.”\n\nCategory: Campus & Community",
      "# [Ohio school district can punish students for misgendering classmates, federal judge rules by KRISTINA WATROBSKI, Crisis in the Classroom, www.facebook.com on 2024-08-05](https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/ohio-school-district-can-punish-students-for-misgendering-classmates-federal-judge-rules-olentangy-local-school-district-lewis-center-parents-defending-education-judge-jane-stranch-nicole-neily-preferred-pronouns-crisis-in-the-classroom)\nAn Ohio school district can punish students for misgendering classmates despite a challenge from a parents' rights group, a federal judge ruled last week.\n\nParents Defending Education (PDE) filed the lawsuit against the Olentangy Local School District (OLSD) last spring over several polices pertaining to harassment and bullying. Under the policies, students are prohibited from intentionally misgendering their classmates, defined as failing to use their preferred pronouns.\n\nBoth the policies and OLSD's student code of conduct also include \"transgender identity\" as a protected group, according to the lawsuit. This designation allows suspension and expulsion to be enforced in any cases of misgendering.\n\nPDE, with the of 17 states and 15 other advocacy groups, argued the policies promote compelled speech and violate students' religious rights. The parents' rights group also claimed the policies infringe upon families' rights to direct the upbringing of their children.\n\nHowever, U.S. Circuit Judge Jane Stranch ruled on July 29 that OLSD's policies are necessary to protect students from harassment. She concluded PDE would be unable to succeed on arguments that the policies compel speech in violation of the First Amendment.\n\n\"The District is entitled to recognize that speech about specific students' identities is particularly harmful and likely to disrupt the educational experience, and to regulate that speech accordingly,\" the ruling reads. \"PDE has failed to clearly show that, by doing so, the District engages in viewpoint discrimination.\"\n\nREAD MORE |\n\nFellow Circuit Judge Alice Batchelder argued in a lengthy dissent that public schools cannot force students \"to pretend [gender transition] is a real thing.\"\n\nAgree or disagree, but that is [PDE's] position,\" Batchelder wrote.\n\nOLSD said in a statement it is pleased with the ruling, noting the district remains committed to \"creating a safe and inclusive environment for all of our students.” Meanwhile, Nicole Neily, PDE president and founder, told Crisis in the Classroom (CITC) that while the group is \"disappointed,\" the ruling is \"not the end of the road.\"\n\n\"As Judge Batchelder persuasively explained in dissent: 'The First Amendment forbids the District from compelling students to use speech that conveys a message with which they disagree, namely that biology does not determine gender,'\" Neily said. \"PDE will seek further review of this decision.”\n\nEarlier this summer, the Ohio House passed a bill banning students from using bathrooms and locker rooms based on gender identity. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine previously expressed support for the legislation, telling reporters in June he would sign it \"as it stands now.\"\n\nThe bill currently sits with the Ohio Senate, which is not scheduled to meet again until November.",

At the time, she had just started performing under her now-iconic stage name, and word of her performances spread quickly among her peers, leading to the creation of the Facebook group titled “Stefani Germanotta, you will never be famous.”\n\nMembers of the group reportedly ridiculed her dreams of becoming famous, mocking her performances and aspirations.\n\nNow, a TikTok post that has gone viral, screenshots of the now-deleted Facebook group were shown, followed by a list of Gaga’s numerous accolades, including her 13 Grammy wins, an Oscar, and a long list of other prestigious awards.\n\nThe “Die With a Smile” singer herself commented on the video, addressing the hate she experienced during her early years: “Some people I went to college [with] made this way back when. This is why you can’t give up when people doubt you or put you down—gotta keep going.”\n\nGaga’s journey to fame wasn’t an overnight success.\n\nAfter leaving college, she began playing small gigs around New York City under the stage name Lady Gaga. Little did her classmates know, she’d go on to release The Fame just a few years later in 2008, with hits like “Just Dance” and “Poker Face” dominating the Billboard charts.\n\nIn 2016, one of her former classmates, Lauren Bohn, shared her memories of the Facebook group, recalling how the members would belittle Gaga’s ambitions and even trample on flyers for her shows.\n\n“I also remember one dude posting a flyer for one of her upcoming gigs at a local village bar. He had clearly stomped on the flyer, an outline of his muddy [sole] struggling to eclipse her name,” Bohn wrote, praising Gaga for sticking to her dreams and breaking through despite the negativity.\n\nSince those early days, Gaga has become one of the most decorated artists in the world. She’s won 13 Grammy Awards, including two for co-writing and performing her A Star Is Born anthem “Shallow,” which also earned her an Oscar.\n\nShe’s landed five No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 and six No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, including Born This Way and Chromatica. Her latest track with Bruno Mars, “Die With a Smile,” also scored the No. 1 spot on Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts.",
      "# [Bullying is linked to school shootings. What do schools need to know? by Anna Merod, Kara Arundel, Roger Riddell, Naaz Modan on 2024-01-10](https://www.k12dive.com/news/bullying-school-shootings-prevention/704206/)\nThis audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.\n\nIt's a common refrain in the wake of school violence: Why would anyone do something like this? But a substantial and growing body of research continues to find strong correlations between school shooters and bullying.\n\nMost attackers who target K-12 schools were bullied — sometimes persistently, according to a 2019 report by the U.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center that analyzed 41 incidents of school violence at K-12 schools between 2008 and 2017.\n\nWhile that analysis only looked at behavioral histories for 35 of the 41 attackers, 80% of those 35 were bullied by classmates, and 57% faced bullying that lasted for weeks, months or years.\n\nThere’s also a 49% higher chance that adolescents will carry guns if they were bullied on school property within the previous year compared to peers who weren't bullied, according to a 2022 study published in the journal Cureus.\n\nAnecdotal evidence of bullying is emerging from last week’s tragic shooting at Perry High School in Iowa — in which a 6th-grader was killed and four other students and three staff members were wounded. In an interview with The Associated Press, two classmates said the 17-year-old shooter who died on the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot wound was “bullied relentlessly since elementary school.”\n\nIt’s important to note that no specific personality profile or traits can be linked to a person who has committed a violent act like a school shooting, said Stephanie Fredrick, associate director of the Alberti Center for Bullying Abuse Prevention at the University at Buffalo. Most students who are bullied do not respond by committing mass violence, she added.\n\n“That being said, yes, many students who have engaged in school shootings or other violent behavior — they do have a history of experiencing bullying,” Fredrick said, citing the 2019 Secret Service center's findings. “Certainly, schools should have a strong dedication to bullying prevention, and I do think that would certainly help to prevent some instances of school shootings.”\n\nAs school and district leaders consider how to embrace bullying prevention more, K-12 Dive spoke with bullying prevention and child psychology experts who shared three approaches to consider.\n\nSet explicit expectations\n\nAccording to data updated in September by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 high school students reported being bullied on school property. More than 1 in 6 high school students reported being bullied online in the last year. Nearly 14% of public schools reported that bullying is a discipline problem occurring daily or at least once a week.\n\nPeter Faustino, a school psychologist in New York who has been practicing for about 25 years, said that the complex issue of bullying has unfortunately been a challenge in schools for a long time.\n\nBut fortunately, he said, awareness and prevention strategies have grown in the past two decades. Faustino, who is also a board member of the New York Association of School Psychologists, advises educators to be observant and responsive.\n\nFor example, if a teacher sees unkind behavior, it's not enough to discourage those actions or words. Instead, he recommends that they talk to the students involved and describe what they've seen rather than jump to accusations.\n\n\"Just the fact that you take an extra second to intervene or ask a question, I think, sometimes can be sort of an agent of change in this whole bullying cycle,\" he said.\n\nTeachers should trust their instincts that something may be amiss with students and continue to share their concerns with administrators until the issue is addressed, he said.\n\nAnother important approach schools should take is to be explicit about what is and isn't acceptable behavior. Those points can be included in a school's code of conduct or handbook — but they also need to be reviewed periodically with students, Faustino said.\n\n\"Sometimes, just really outlining what the expectations are can be incredibly powerful,\" he said.\n\nImplement bystander education\n\nFaustino also said it's important for school communities to note that bullying isn't only about two students — the person who bullies and the target of bullying — but encompasses a broader circle that includes supporters and defenders of those involved, bystanders and others.\n\n\"Everybody in school, at some level, plays a role. And everybody at some level could potentially intervene to kind of mitigate some of the challenges between bullying and victimization,\" he said.\n\nA schoolwide bullying prevention program should also include a bystander component, Fredrick said. This includes teaching students what to do if they’re involved in or witness a bullying situation.\n\n“There’s just so much that adults don’t know about what’s happening in the school. Students are often not telling adults what’s happening, but peers know,” Fredrick said. “That bystander component is key to preventing bullying, including bullying that might lead to these more violent instances including school shootings.”\n\nBut Fredrick also recognizes that bullying prevention can be difficult to implement as schools are often under-resourced and “putting out fires all day long.” Even so, prevention is a crucial part of addressing bullying in schools, she said, and schools should try to consistently implement a program over time instead of using a one-off occasion such as a schoolwide assembly without any follow-up.\n\nOther crucial components in bullying prevention programs include teaching social-emotional learning skills, empathy, problem-solving skills and internet safety, Fredrick said. There should also be anonymous reporting mechanisms for students to flag problematic behavior, she added.\n\nEndorse inclusive practices\n\nLike Faustino, Jessica Dirsmith, a school psychologist for Arin Intermediate Unit 28, which serves 11 districts and two technical schools in Pennsylvania, advises schools to take time to explicitly teach about their core values and expected behaviors.\n\nSchools need to be proactive about endorsing inclusive practices and normalizing differences, said Dirsmith, who will be the 2024-25 president-elect of the Association of School Psychologists of Pennsylvania.\n\nEducators should be aware that students who are perceived to be different from other children, such as having a physical difference, could make them more susceptible to bullying, she said. Additional mental well-being screeners and supports may be needed for those students.",

      "# [Breaking barriers: Child Life classmates lean on each other as program’s first Black students](https://www.fcs.uga.edu/news/story/breaking-barriers-child-life-classmates-lean-on-each-other-as-programs-first-black-students)\nOver a boxed lunch during a stressful weekend, Aspen Thompson made a new friend.\n\nIn Athens to interview for acceptance into the College of Family and Consumer Sciences’ competitive master’s of science in Child Life program last winter, Thompson admitted she was a little “spooked” by the process.\n\nWhen the candidates met for lunch, Thompson settled into a seat next to JaQuira Wallace. As the two began chatting, a light-hearted exchange marked the beginning of what would become a unique friendship.\n\n“We were joking because she doesn’t like sweets,” Thompson said. “I love sweets, so I traded my fruit for her cookie.”\n\nThompson and Wallace soon discovered more commonalities.\n\nThey both come from military backgrounds. Both of Thompson’s parents were officers in the Navy in California and Texas before retiring to Virginia. Wallace’s father recently retired from a career in the Air Force in South Carolina.\n\nThey learned they shared a Christian faith and they both have wrestled with perfectionist tendencies.\n\nAmong a few other common threads, Thompson and Wallace also have another obvious connection: they’re both Black students, possibly the program’s first in its 30-year history, pursuing a career as Child Life Specialists where Black practitioners make up just 11 percent of the field nationwide.\n\n“We have a lot of shared passions, dreams, convictions and experiences when it comes to being a Black student in general,” Thompson said. “It’s just another layer of closeness, and it’s easy to feel like we’re collaborating and spurring each other on.”\n\n'I just want to help'\n\nChild Life Specialists serve a unique role in the healthcare field. They typically work in hospitals, supporting the psychosocial needs of children and families to help them understand their illness or injury and develop positive coping skills.\n\nFaculty member Diane Bales, professor and UGA Cooperative Extension human development specialist, directs the FACS program, with clinical assistant professor Stephanie Whitten serving as clinical coordinator.\n\nA recent class focused on death and bereavement in which students were presented the following case study:\n\n“You’ve been working in oncology. When you arrive for work, you find out that a 14-year-old boy you have seen on and off for a year died the night before. You tear up when you see his parents. What do you say and do?”\n\nThe students’ discussions covered issues like self-care, establishing professional boundaries and being genuine with children and families.\n\nWhile acknowledging the heaviness of certain aspects of the job, Wallace said she’s convinced she’s exactly where she’s meant to be.\n\n“It sounds cliché, but I just want to help,” she said. “It’s always been a goal of mine to be an advocate for children any way I can. I want to be that person rooting for them when it feels like they don’t have anybody rooting for them.”\n\nWallace’s passion for the field grew out of watching her mother’s interactions with kids in her preschool classroom. Later, an advisor in Wallace’s undergraduate program at the College of Charleston recommended Child Life, and Wallace’s path was set.\n\n“I did my research and thought ‘I could really see myself being successful in this field,’ ” she said.\n\nThompson earned an undergraduate degree in pre-clinical public health at Liberty University, where she also played volleyball, but discovered a passion for Child Life when a family friend’s young son was diagnosed with leukemia.\n\n“His mom just raved about the Child Life specialists on his care team and how it had made such a big difference,” Thompson said. “I had no idea that job had a name, but I really knew that was something I felt called to do and was the sweet spot between my love for medicine and my passion for serving and supporting.”\n\nTheir paths converged at UGA, where they joined a small cohort of four first-year students in the rigorous program in which students are required to complete an internship at a hospital and are then eligible to sit for the Child Life Certification Exam.\n\nIn short, it’s a lot. Both Wallace and Thompson say they’ve been stretched in the program and lean on each other for comfort and encouragement.\n\n“I firmly believe God put Aspen and me in this program together to develop a friendship and be intentional and talk about our experiences as Black students and Black women, and I really appreciate that,” Wallace said. “I know she will always be there for me.”\n\nA culture of support\n\nDiversifying the field of Child Life is a priority for many programs, including FACS.\n\nAccording to the careers website Zippia, 60 percent of Certified Child Life Specialists identify as white and 75 percent are women.\n\nWallace said she has tried to find other Black practitioners on LinkedIn, but has been unsuccessful.\n\n“I’m hoping that’s something that can change,” she said.\n\nWhitten agrees.\n\n“Minority representation in the field of Child Life is vital to diversifying the workforce,” she said. “When children and families see individuals who look like them or share similar backgrounds, they feel more understood and supported, which can positively impact their emotional well-being throughout hospitalization.”\n\nWhile acknowledging the importance of recognizing the gap for existing practitioners of color, Thompson said one of the strengths of the FACS program is the open atmosphere fostered by Bales and Whitten.\n\n“There are so many people rooting for you here,” Thompson said. “Everybody is invited to share and give perspective without it feeling like you’re being called out or embarrassed.”\n\nWallace has had a similar experience. She said she’s had encouraging conversations with both Bales and Whitten about the issue and is optimistic about the future based on her experience at UGA.\n\n“I’ve just really felt comfortable here,” she said. “It feels like a family to me.”"
