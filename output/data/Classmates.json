Classmates.com is primarily focused on connecting high school alumni, boasting over 90 million members as of 2023 [(Wikimedia Contributors, Wikipedia, 2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classmates.com).\n\nThe platform features a vast archive of over 470,000 digitized high school yearbooks, allowing members to purchase reprints and engage in various social networking activities such as private messaging, class lists, and reunion planning. In 2020, Classmates.com introduced a virtual reunion feature, which became particularly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing users to connect without the need for physical travel [(Wikimedia Contributors, Wikipedia, 2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classmates.com).\n\nClassmates.com generates revenue through user-generated content, paid subscriptions, and advertising. The platform has facilitated over 30,000 reunions in 2022, showcasing its continued relevance in fostering connections among alumni [(Wikimedia Contributors, Wikipedia, 2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classmates.com).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Steven Gray**: CEO of Classmates.com, leading the company under the PeopleConnect umbrella.\n- **Sarah Howe**: President of the Classmates division, focusing on strategic direction and user engagement.\n- **Sach Barot**: CFO, responsible for the financial management of the company [(Wikimedia Contributors, Wikipedia, 2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classmates.com).\n\n# News\n\n## Acquisitions and Partnerships\n\nClassmates.com was acquired by PeopleConnect Holdings, Inc. in August 2015, marking a significant shift in its operational structure. This acquisition followed the company's previous ownership under United Online, Inc. [(Wikimedia Contributors, Wikipedia, 2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classmates.com).\n\n## Legal Issues\n\nClassmates.com has faced legal challenges, including a consumer protection lawsuit filed by five District Attorneys in California, which resulted in updated subscription renewal disclosures and a settlement. Additionally, the company has been involved in class action lawsuits related to misleading email practices and hidden online shopping fees, leading to financial settlements and commitments to improve transparency [(Wikimedia Contributors, Wikipedia, 2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classmates.com).\n\n## Community Engagement\n\nClassmates.com has been involved in community engagement through its user base, particularly during crises, as seen in the recent volunteer efforts by students in Pasadena and Altadena [(Syeed, Religion News Service, 2025)](https://religionnews.com/2025/01/16/my-gen-z-daughter-and-her-altadena-classmates-are-showing-us-the-way/).\n\n## General Sentiment and Opinions\n\nClassmates.com has been mentioned in various media contexts, including its use in creative projects like the Netflix show \"Stranger Things,\" where the platform's yearbook archives were utilized for inspiration. However, the platform has also faced criticism regarding its marketing practices and user experience, which have led to legal scrutiny and settlements [(Wikimedia Contributors, Wikipedia, 2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classmates.com).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nClassmates.com remains a significant player in the social networking space for alumni, with a rich history and a large user base. Despite facing legal challenges and competition from newer platforms, its unique offerings, such as a vast yearbook archive and reunion planning features, continue to attract users. Prospective candidates and investors should consider the company's historical context, current leadership, and ongoing developments as they evaluate its potential for future growth and engagement. \n\nFor further verification and details, please refer to the cited sources.",

      "# Post ID f51fx2: Received an email from classmates.com about account registration using my real full name. But I didn't make the account and the password is something I've never used. with +16 score by [(fritocloud, Reddit, 2020-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/f51fx2/received_an_email_from_classmatescom_about/)\nClassmates.com... sounds familiar right? The kings of spam. They came out before Facebook and friendster but they went with the premium model and I had assumed they would have went out of business. I know they were sued at one point for deceptive advertising practices because they would email you saying that something was happening with your account but you had to pay to see what it was. And then when you paid, you would discover that nothing was happening with your account. Well, I just got an email from them welcoming me to the site. The thing is, I didn't make an account with them. I honestly can't remember if I ever made one with this email account (I know I signed up with them at some point but I'm pretty sure I was still using an AOL account at the time, lol. And that was many many years ago.) Anyways, I've gotten emails like this before where someone is using my email address with random info and I just assume it is some sort of scammer or spammer or bots or whatever. I usually go in and report or deactivate the account and no big deal. But this is the first time it has ever happened with my real first and last name. The other weird thing is they are using my full first name and for most things that I sign up for, I use a shortened version of my name. Which makes it less likely they got my name from one of those data leaked lists but not impossible. \n\nThere is a button to report the account for \"being made in error\" but that's the final twist to this. I really don't trust classmates.com and I really don't want to click that link in the email until I know what's going on. The way I see it, this could just be a diabolical plot on classmates.com's part, trying to get customers for their site or whatever.\n\nSo, I guess what I'm looking for is any advice on how to handle this. I should note that I do monitor my credit reports pretty thoroughly so I'm not too worried about any kind of identity theft issues with my SSN attached. Also, has anyone else had this happen to them? With this specific site or another site? Does anyone have any idea how this would happen? I very much doubt it is a real person who just coincidentally has my exact name and that they mistakenly put *my* email address (which is fairly unique and does not have my name in it at all) in when they were signing up.\n\n[Here is a screenshot with my info and the info from the fraudulent account omitted.](http://imgur.com/a/FwRkO4G)\n\nAlso, [here is some dogtax](http://imgur.com/gallery/TzWkUWO) (not mine found it on imgur while uploading my screenshot. So cute.)\n\nThanks in advance, everyone.\n\n## Comment ID fhw7bmr with +14 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/f51fx2/received_an_email_from_classmatescom_about/fhw7bmr/) (in reply to ID f51fx2):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID fhwa4rw with +7 score by [(fritocloud, Reddit, 2020-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/f51fx2/received_an_email_from_classmatescom_about/fhwa4rw/) (in reply to ID fhw7bmr):\nJust the hope, though.

It’s a clear attempt to find age, hometown, and photos of job candidates. Has it really come down to this? I’ve taken down everything except for deleting the account entirely. By default the nature of the Classmates platform is that it lists your schools’ location and graduation date.

Nearly every potential employer is going to do a quick look either before the interviews or after while they are considering applicants.

I deactivated my Facebook in 2015, but reactivated it in 2021 when I was job hunting. I have since maintained it similarly to my LinkedIn. Never had anything else as I really didn't care, I never post anyway.  \n\n\n Reddit is basically 4chan with forced usernames. Similar to forums I used to post on. This site is almost completely anon with the exception the leadership having an email and it's your choice if that email matters or not as an identifier. \n\n\n I have noticed an uptick on Reddit lately though of people who think short account age and lack of history is sus. I delete and remake my reddit accounts constantly.\n\n\n The younger generation is terminally online to their detriment. They seem to place value in having an online identity that is tied to their real world counter which I personally will never understand.  \n\n\n This makes me an \"old\", which is why I have a public facing Facebook, because \"old people use Facebook\".

Everyone should freeze their account there (theworknumber\"dot\"com). I made a couple different posts on antiwork about it and they never got any traction. I tell everyone I know to freeze their accounts and few people take it seriously. The Work Number has so much information about your previous employment including salary, vacation and sick time taken, if you were enrolled in benefits or 401k, how much your deductions were, etc.\n\nImagine you are getting paid $80k at your current job and you apply for a job with an advertised salary of $95k. You try to be casual about it during the interview and say \"I'm looking for at least $95k. I make just a bit less than that at my current job, so with my experience and tenure I feel like $95k is fair compensation.\" They say \"Yep, sounds fair, that's right in line with our budget for this position.\" And then they pull your background check, including your job history through TWN, and find out you currently only make $80k, and lowball you at $84k.

Jobs were one of the main reasons. I personally would not tie my name to anything if I can avoid it, and I set my privacy settings to as strict as I can. Like on Facebook, you can search my name or email all day, and you won't find me because it is not publicly available. I don't use my real name for Twitter, YouTube, or anything I can avoid. Really, just Facebook has my name, and unless I find you, you can't see my Facebook. And I don't even say or do things that I am worried about, I just like my privacy. \n\nYou never know what you say today that won't be okay tomorrow.

He knows that Kris has this power, and he knows the dangers of it. \n\nInstead of asking please never do a true reset like Flowey does at the end of credits. Ralsei is lying to Kris, specifically to fool us(the players) into thinking he is on our side, while he is slowly building a way to get rid of the Determination power from Kris. He is on the good side with good intentions, but he is not on OUR side.

Jockington wears sunglasses; one of the purple items is ‘Cloudy Glasses,’ Temmie wears a brimmed cap; ‘Cowboy hat,’ Noelle is associated with christmas; you tie gift boxes up with Ribbons, and a toy knife is a potential gift. Snowy is very defensive about his comedy and potentially uses humor as a defense to begin with, and the green heart items are very defensive focused gear. Monster kid is pretty brave, considering he can stand up to Undyne, while he is wearing orange and I guess the glove is just kind of ironic. We don’t get a good look at Catti’s normal get-up, but being a waitress does require some level of grace a la ballet. As for Berdley, maybe it makes a bit more sense if you think of there being two red souls; Chara and Frisk, and thus they’re sort of rivals who aren’t that different in the end? I wouldn’t be surprised if Berdley turns out to have a similar situation to Kris, with Noelle being their only ‘friend.’\n\n#### Comment ID hb4e9o4 with +7 score by [(_AntiSocialMedia, Reddit, 2021-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb4e9o4/) (in reply to ID hb4crx4):\nThing is, so far, everyone in Deltarune has the same personality as their Undertale counterparts, different relationships and different jobs, yeah, but still the same personality.\n\nAnd, well, Snowy just isn't *that* nice in Undertale, he straight up calls Frisk unfunny if they tell a joke because he's jealous, and we know it's jealousy, and not Frisk just being unfunny, because even *Ice Cap* and *Jerry* think Frisk's jokes are funny.\n\n### Comment ID hbll4vn with +5 score by [(TheLegend2T, Reddit, 2021-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hbll4vn/) (in reply to ID hb4adde):\nII like how there's no debate Jockington is Perseverance\n\n## Comment ID hb3bz7g with +12 score by [(pascuales, Reddit, 2021-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb3bz7g/) (in reply to ID pfcg31):\nMakes sense considering that we have the main characters (Frisk; Kris, Susie and Ralsei) but in Undertale we wouldn't be able to win without the souls' help.

      "# Post ID 15jb38u: The Undertale Versions of Kris' classmates with +10 score by [(Chacochilla, Reddit, 2023-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/15jb38u/the_undertale_versions_of_kris_classmates/)\nTrying to think of what those characters would be like in Undertale, and how the differences between universes would change them. \n\nI'm going to assume that they're all around Frisk's age in UT also\n\nTo start off with, Noelle lost her father, but Dess is still around. Her family lives in that one far away house in the canyons of Snowdin forest. After Rudy died, Carol became a lot more over-protective of her daughters, and shelters them. So Noelle and Dess don't usually get to see other people aside from when they sneak off into town. Dess is also pretty protective of Noelle. Those two sheltering her, as well as her not being around other kids her age means that Noelle won't break out of her shell as much as she did in Deltarune. She's a lot more quiet and nervous around others, and is pretty attached at the heel to Dess.\n\nSnowdrake also lives in Snowdin forest. He's seen Noelle's mom and is, terrified of her. This leads to him telling MK, who spreads rumors about this terrifying deer woman and her two daughters to the other kids\n\nSusie, Berdly, Catti, Jockington, and MK all live in New Home \n\nSusie has a better life than in Deltarune. Whatever happened to her (orphaned, ran away, human parents, what have you) didn't happen here, and she just lives with her parents in New Home. She's still brash and rude, but everyone knows her. Unlike deltarune, her peers aren't scared of her and have accepted her eccentricities. Main issue I have with her is that I don't know what kids, do. On a day to day basis. Like I doubt she'd pay much mind to her future when she's like 10. Maybe she'd pull pranks around town sorta like Kris did when they were younger?\n\nAlso Clamgirl mentions that 'Suzy' is her neighbor's daughter, which is, interesting. Maybe I could have the Goners have an interest in her, for some reason?\n\nBerdly I have two ideas for. Dunno which one to choose.\n\nIdea 1: He's basically the same as in Deltarune. He still won a spelling bee, except this time he didn't have Noelle to compete with, and still equates his self worth to smarts. Still smug, but more tired as he doesn't have anyone to help him study. He either wants to work as a Core engineer or a royal scientist when he's older. If the former I'll have him look up to Ms. Boom, if the latter, I'll have him look up to Alphys\n\nIdea 2: The spelling bee didn't happen and he doesn't equate his self worth with smarts. Instead, he befriended Susie. They're both tough (Berdly has crazy states in his battle. I think Susie does more damage, but Berdly has a lot of HP), like video games, and are kinda dumb. With this option I could also see Berdly having an interest in the royal guard, though I worry that'll make him too similar to Papyrus\n\nAnd with Catti and Jockington, they'll just be the same as Deltarune. Jock does sports, Catti does black magic, and they're friends\n\nSo yeah. Lemme know if this sounds in character, which idea for Berdly is better, and what y'all think and if y'all have any ideas\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sprites](https://preview.redd.it/u5o2dpzzrdgb1.png?width=2320&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbea0dcdf84ee5bd2bfa2d653273ffd72c767ed9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Possible royal guard trainee Berdly designs](https://preview.redd.it/y4sdtmzxsdgb1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=32641fb87eddf8bbcf9b60c99c8cf730abb87884)\n\n## Comment ID juyxeld with +5 score by [(Lemoineau11, Reddit, 2023-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/15jb38u/the_undertale_versions_of_kris_classmates/juyxeld/) (in reply to ID 15jb38u):\nI don't have anything to add except I see Rudy as part of an amalgamate.

IMO:\n\nGood: Jockington (Lawful), Noelle (Neutral), Susie (Chaotic)\n\nReasoning: Susie is obvious. Noelle is too big an endorser of Susie's chaos to be Lawful herself. It's not just that she's crushing on her, it's also that Susie's strong in ways she wishes she could be (“scary in a good way”). Jockington — a purehearted jock — just radiates LG vibes somehow.\n\nNeutral: Berdly (Lawful), Catti (Neutral), Kris (Chaotic)\n\nReasoning: You really think the resident prankster is anything other than chaotic? Catti is too apathetic to be lawful *or* chaotic. And Berdly... he's willing to kill his classmate of his own free will, but he also does a lot of good things, and he is very much on the side of law/order — the opposite of Kris and Susie's chaos.\n\nObviously Snowy is the true villain of Deltarune /s I mean SnowGrave literally has snow in the name!!'\n\n### Comment ID ixsryl0 with +8 score by [(TheFryToes, Reddit, 2022-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/z47n58/i_made_an_alignment_chart_of_the_classmates_is_it/ixsryl0/) (in reply to ID ixpmqnq):\nLove how you didn’t dispute the Temmy one\n\n### Comment ID ixsjh71 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-11-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/z47n58/i_made_an_alignment_chart_of_the_classmates_is_it/ixsjh71/) (in reply to ID ixpmqnq):\nPetition to rename Snowy to \"annoying NPC\"\n\n## Comment ID ixq1jmp with +28 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-11-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/z47n58/i_made_an_alignment_chart_of_the_classmates_is_it/ixq1jmp/) (in reply to ID z47n58):\n\"tem get a SMART! go to COLLEG!! achieve DREAM!!\nthen tem become...

      "# Post ID 8ciy5u: I love computer science. I hate my fellow computer science classmates. with +215 score by [(wtfthefuck, Reddit, 2018-04-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/)\nI need to get this off my chest, so please read my entire post instead of downvoting me based on my arrogant title. \n\nI am a computer science undergrad myself. I've always been fascinated with computers and the Internet ever since I was young. I simply cannot see myself working outside of this area - the incredible space for innovation and the power of exponential technologies is, to me, simply the most exciting thing I can think of. I constantly read about future technologies (shoutout to /r/Futurology) and find it disappointing that not many people share this admiration of mine, especially in this fantastic time period in which we live.\n\nI could spend hours talking about why I chose to study computer science, but I'll leave that for some other time. I need to talk about why I dislike my peers.\n\nI am definitely an introvert, but in my class of initially 50 people* I was probably the most outgoing. I haven't made many friends in college, which truly made me sad in the beginning because I could see myself making more (and better) friends if I were to study pretty much anything else. The only thing that me and 90% of my classmates have in common is that we, for different reasons, chose to study CS. Most of these people are your typical anime-loving gamers, which is of no interest to me. Most of them plan on focusing on game development, which is fine, but they simply don't have an open mind for other ideas an technologies. They play games and want to make games, as if that is even a realistic scenario. \n\nI don't even need to mention most of them are awkward as hell. This is no reason for me to dislike any of them, but it definitely makes it more difficult for me to bond with them. I have one good friend who shares common interests with me and doesn't act awkward at all. My other friends are nice people and (sometimes) good to hang out with, but they are definitely weird. I almost forgot to mention there is only one girl in my class, which really disappoints me, but I can't say I don't comprehend.\n\nI feel like we need more people in CS who are also interested in the arts and humanities, as I see this as an important trait for understanding the power of the technologies we deal with. As Steve Jobs said it, \"Edwin Land of Polaroid talked about the intersection of the humanities and science, I like that intersection. There’s something magical about that place.\"\n\nI think it is important to note that I am from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and this is based on my point of view, I don't want to generalize CS students. I guess in a more developed country more people would be interested and open to the possibility of studying CS, and therefore providing more diversity among students. And that is exactly what I would like to see.\n\nI hope I haven't offended any readers in any way with my personal thoughts. I'm just very passionate about technology and can't seem to get the same vibe from the people I deal with on a daily basis.\n\n*I would say 50% of the people who started college with me already quit. Every semester some people leave, and we only had 2 (TWO) people graduating in CS last semester. But CS is hard, nothing new here.\n\n\n## Comment ID dxfc6b7 with +115 score by [(valbaca, Reddit, 2018-04-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfc6b7/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\nYup. Sounds like CS Undergrad hasn't changed one bit (pun intended).\n\nI'm pretty antisocial but even I went outside the CS department to find friends because they were insufferable. Every guy thought they were Neo, or House M.D. or some other \"genius douche\" persona. Each with their own terrible concoction of technical arrogance that they try to cover up their own insecurities with.\n\nCollege should have no shortage of interesting groups you can join to meet.  Sports, politics, and diversity groups are usually the largest.\n\nPerhaps also look outside your immediate major; perhaps during electives and such. I did a dual EE / CS program and the contrast between (most) EE classmates and CS was astounding. EE students would work hard in groups, help each other, and would be happy to grab drinks or hangout afterward.\n\n### Comment ID dxfhhol with +13 score by [(hubbahubbawubba, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfhhol/) (in reply to ID dxfc6b7):\nI was in a similar program, and I think the contrast may have to do with when the programs break you, so to speak. In an EE program, you've already had to survive modern physics during or before the first semester of sophomore year. CS, by contrast, doesn't really break you until you take advanced algorithms (junior, or, for some people, even senior year). Having your own delusions of grandeur destroyed early helps foster the cooperative spirit you see in a lot of engineering programs.\n\n#### Comment ID dxfp8sd with +10 score by [(aogmana, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfp8sd/) (in reply to ID dxfhhol):\nI think this is a really good point. My CS program doesnt feel like what people in this thread are talking about.

I was a very social out-going person in highschool. Did the sports, drank the beer, etc. Firstly, you need to recognize that these people are a different breed. Secondly, you need to understand that you are a part of the problem (hear me out).\n\nI was always a computer guy though and loved playing games so I went in and you're right, the culture is very different. I was very jaded to not make friends quickly because everyone is so reserved. However, you need to understand that some people have a very hard time opening up and relating to people.\n\nFriendships are built off of social contracts. When going into a new environment with different types of people than what you are use to, you have to understand that you will not make friends if you do not share some interests. Anime is garbage, that's my opinion. Magic the Gathering is boring. Bassnectar is an overrated DJ. There are tons of things that I dislike however I will still support others and even venture down the rabbit hole to explore some of these topics to firstly, give company to potential friends and two, maybe see if I like it down the line. \n\nFriendship should be a two way street as well, so if you go to anime-con or whatever it is, try to get your new friend to do something that you like thats out of his/her comfort zone. People are reluctant to change, just like you. But breaking down barriers and trying things you don't like will either expose you to something that maybe down the line you enjoy, or expose other people to try other things that they might enjoy, and make friends while doing it.\n\nMy co-worker loves VR, soul-caliber, magic the gathering, and things I don't quite enjoy. However, I'll still go over and play some of these games because he likes to play them with people. Afterwards, I'll say lets hit the bar and he generally dragged his feet the first couple times but now he loves to go. And to be honest, play soul caliber has actually gotten a little fun, i must admit. My other group of friends love dubstep and going to Bassnectar shows. I dislike dubstep and Bassnectar and would rather see other artists, but I still have fun because I'm with people that are friends and we'll end up going to another show that I like sometime. Hell, I even got one of these hippy dudes to play some overwatch with me.\n\nAll in all, be more open to these people. Scratch that, be more open to all people. Lots of these guys are nerdy introverts, but are really cool when you get to know them.\n\nAs for the girls in CS, get used to it bud.\n\n### Comment ID dxh5qqk with +16 score by [(PetrichorBySulphur, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxh5qqk/) (in reply to ID dxfized):\nThanks for saying this.

I'm a mix of introvert and extrovert. I tend to be friendly, can hold a conversation well, and I'm interested in almost everything. To make matters worse, I'm a girl who is into fashion (I have a mean shoe collection), and other things generally not ascribed to CS people. I get along with everyone, but am not really close with most CS people because the similar interests just aren't there.\n\nI totally get your experience with CS kids not caring about anything but CS. For instance, one of our professors had us doing a multicultural day where we focused on programming tasks with a multicultural component. One kid decided to sit out because he 'didn't care about culture,' and took a 0 grade instead of participating. I frequently have to hear people sneer at any major that isn't STEM, and yet, when they have to engage in topics like politics, geography, or literature, the amount they don't know is simply astounding. I think it's just a cop out/ excuse when I hear them say those topics aren't challenging enough for them.\n\nI am lucky because I found a few people like me in CS who are pretty outgoing and socially balanced. I would say just try to make friends in your non-cs classes. It's okay if you just don't have the same interests as the CS kids. \n\nAlso didn't see you were from Brazil until I already wrote the above.

Management relies on the the devs who can communicate highly technical problems in a language without jargon and lingo so that they can make business decisions based on it. Larger dev teams rely on dev leads who have creativity and long-term vision to compose architectures for systems that will allow them to divide, conquer, and scale solutions for very large and complicated problem spaces. And sadly, the industry is actually sorely lacking many who can do both of those things well. Most devs in the industry right now are like most of your classmates: tightly clinging to the need to believe they are amazing at what they do because they need that to define their persona and value in society. As a result, they often never expand their knowledge beyond a single platform, language, or area of expertise, because outside of their niche, they would no longer be as good as they believe they are within their niche.\n\nOn the other hand, the relative few devs who are more creative and artistically-inclined spend their careers soaking up everything they can about every language and platform that sounds interesting to learn. Even if they never use that platform again in the future, they learn new ways of solving problems and new abstractions that apply to every platform and every language. The devs at my point in my career who have done this are nowadays typically the full-stack developers and, in fact, that's exactly what I do. I build servers in Java EE or Spring used by mobile client applications which I also build for Android and iOS. I learned all of those platforms and languages and many more on side projects long before I ever needed them in the workplace just because I love learning new things. Except for me and the other lead architect on the project, all other devs only work on one of our codebases because they never bothered to and don't want to learn any of the others. Being an \"Android Developer\" or an \"iOS Developer\" or a \"server-side developer\" is what defines them.\n\nSo that would be the best advice that I could offer to you. Don't settle for a niche like you'll see so many others do in your career. Never stop learning. Always be thirsty for more. If you can't think of a reason to learn something new that you're interested in, create a side project that opens the door on that reason. And don't let your career or your niche define who you are. As someone in the industry different from many other developers, you can much more easily become much bigger than just a niche. For me, when people ask what I do for a living, I tell them, \"I write software\", not that \"I am a software developer\". Because it's not who I am. It's just what I do. Who I am is much bigger than just my job.\n\n## Comment ID dxfi3qe with +2 score by [(puppypink, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfi3qe/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\nI'm about as extroverted as you can get, and I agree it can be tough making friends in com sci courses! I think part of it, however, comes from self-imposed beliefs - a lot of coworkers I know seem social and fairly outgoing when we hang out, but said they didn't have friends as undergrads, because they were engineers, so they just stayed in their dorms and played video games. \nI'm minoring in studio art, and the students in those classes are more sociable during class, but I still didn't see them often outside of class until I started inviting them to events we were both interested in - gallery receptions, campus activities, even a movie we both wanted to see. Every friend you have was once a stranger, and it took one of you to reach out - it might as well be you! If you don't want to or don't feel you know any individual well enough, see about organizing a small weekend event, like a game tournament or code jam, and invite your whole class(es)! That way, you can get to know each other over something you all like, but can get to know them in a more casual environment.\nAlso, your views of your classmates sounds rather conceited. If you haven't made friends with many of these people, how do you know they don't have the same interests as you? How do you know their reasons for going into computer science? It seems like you're quick to label them all as \"typical anime-loving gamers\" despite sounding like you don't know most of them too well. Stop assuming things about your peers and just talk to them.

What we can do, is talk to people that shares the same interests, don't think that you are alone. Even my teachers face these thoughts, I made more friends with teachers than with classmates haha, since, think about it, a teacher spends years doing/studying computer science, so *maybe*, he loves it too. I know that there are some teachers that hates their jobs but that's something for another day. \n\nEstou falando de Londrina, Brasil! ;) Será que isso é um problema que afeta brasileiros?\n\nBy the way, let's keep contact with each other, since it's very, very hard, to find someone that simply likes humanities and CS. I love art/music, this doesn't means that I can create any of both, haha. I've never saw that Steve Jobs quote, it's interesting, this \"space between\" is real, we need more of that.\n\nFollow my [Github](http://www.https.com//www.github.com/MatMercer/), let's keep contact with each other.\n\n### Comment ID dxgffus with +2 score by [(wtfthefuck, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxgffus/) (in reply to ID dxgdqzp):\nPretty interesting stuff in your Github!

But programming in a real language, since 2015, when I made the \"whatsapp-web bot\" in JS (doesn't works anymore).

I'm not into designing and making games, or going into a cyber security field. I like AI, and Quantum. That being said something I love about CS is how everyone's this meme loving nerd. As a comp sci student you're basically the grunts of industry. The field is constantly evolving, because it's so new! This results in some level of animosity towards Lib. Arts students and the like. Some of their courses are a joke, ngl. That being said most people are artistically inclined in some way or the other. I like taking photos for example. I've worked with other Engineering people in research, and I have to say I can't mingle with them as easily. They often don't share a similar sense of humor. I think the most important thing about comp sci is balance. I looove coding up stuff, and I love looking at algorithms, and doing the math related to CS, but I also spend ample time looking at other sciences, and trying to apply what I learned there.\n\n## Comment ID dxh7ibf with +2 score by [(HelloHaiHey, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxh7ibf/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\nI’m sort of on the same boat but not quite?? I’m in my first year of college majoring in CS (obviously) but I cant really connect with people in my classes, specially since I’m one of two females in my current class. I think it’s mostly due to the fact that I decided I wanted to go into Computer Science in my last year of high school. \n\nMostly I’m pursuing computer science because I learned in my last year that I love coding. While I am getting introduced to the more technical aspect of things I know for a fact my major interest is programming languages and what I can do with them. I mean you can do so many amazing things with programming it amazes me. \n\nI honestly didnt really connect with some of my classmates until we were grouped together for a group project and then we got talking. But honestly I found my best friends to be people from outside my major. I was friendless until my second semester and I only became friends with people because I started getting involved with activities around the college. I also got a job at the college and managed to create a really strong bond with all the people I work with. It’s really amazing and we all have different majors so that’s even more reassuring. Maybe people in other tech related majors might share the same passion for technology you have!\n\n## Comment ID dxhxv7b with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-04-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxhxv7b/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\nI feel like you may be writing off some of your peers with getting to know them, although this may just be because my experience is different. \n\nAlso, please don't  complain about the gender ratio unless you're actively trying to change it.

There are no classes, abot 250 people start visiting the lectures every year at my university. So naturally there is way more diversity to the students. \nMost people here don't have plans what to do in the future and rather let themselves be inspired by the lectures. \nThere is about 30% girls though most of them plan on becoming teachers.\nI conaider CS extremely easy since i came from math and CS is just math in 10 times easier. I would say put of 250 about 100 get their bachelor. \nIf you want to have friends with hih interest in CS go to a university that is very good in the fiel, it will attract all the people who are very good and interested in CS.\nAnd about the awkward peolpe, I found that it is very easy to talk to them because you as an introvert can relate and become way more confident.\n\n## Comment ID dxfh724 with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfh724/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID dxfin0g with +11 score by [(wtfthefuck, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfin0g/) (in reply to ID dxfh724):\nThere is literally just one single sentence in this long post in which I address this issue with women in CS.

However, I’m a girl who is doing a double major in CS and Games Technology. Honestly, though, I really dislike most people who are super openly into gaming/think they’re going to easily get a job in games. Everyone is so weird here. I’m studying Games Tech because it’s an interest and it’s supposedly quite a complex and difficult course, but I know that CS is what’s going to get me a job in the end ultimately. People are so competitive if you say you’re into games here, I’d rather not. I just want to go have some drinks with friends, chat about life stuff, and then come home and play whatever I’m playing at the time, not make a big deal of it all. \n\nI was hoping to make more friends here, but I think you’re right and I’ll need to spread my wings across to other majors.\n\n## Comment ID dxftya5 with +2 score by [(JaiX1234, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxftya5/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\nYep this is CS, I can’t find people who want to do good with CS.

It can be  ridiculously hard to find them because they think of their CS classmates the same way you do. About a quarter of my CS class is girls and I've gravitated towards them more since a lot of them are majoring in mathematics/physics and more interested in concepts/theory.\n\nDon't stress about to it too much, make friends outside of your CS program and let it play out.

Feels like basically every CS student fits the stereotype of spends all their time at home playing video games and watching anime with little to no interested in humanities, politics, philosophy, etc. It makes sense though why those kinds of people would gravitate towards CS. As someone who does have interests in philosophy and politics, I can't say that I'm really excelling in my STEM courses. I'm getting by but in humanities courses I actually excel. I primarily chose CS because I want to have the ability to make my dreams come to life and start my own business(es) and I think programming might be the best avenue to do that requiring the lowest amount of capital. I mean programming can basically allow you to make anything which is what it's attraction was to me. Humanities is something that although is interesting to me doesn't really translate into helping me start my own business. \n\nAnd stereo-typically enough the introverted gamer nerdy types are also the ones that seem to perform the best in my CS classes and the worst in their humanities classes.\n\n## Comment ID dxfsw6t with +1 score by [(memoriten, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfsw6t/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\nI understand what you are saying, I also don't really like my classmates because they live inside some kind of bubble.\n\n## Comment ID dxfvnbq with +1 score by [(JezzaPar, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfvnbq/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\nDamn I feel like I wrote this post myself.

I also  don't really understand why most people also think that it is strange that i take CS and often wonder why more people don't take it especially assuming that it is currently and will most likely remain as one of if not the most fruitful per-say  industries today with all of the future technological possibilities and also the fact that almost everyone in the worlds population has a computing device in the form of a mobile phone to a games console to a desktop pc. My theory as to why people don't take it is that they just don't understand it but then i just come off as a bit off a prick i guess. But i would be nice to see more and more people getting interested in computer science. Alright bye guys"

I know you think that because you're a VP you know more than the rest of us, but look back over the last three years.  See all that failure and waste of money & time?  Those were all your GREAT ideas.  \r\n\r\n3. YOU CAN'T SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH ANOTHER ROUND OF LAYOFFS.

In fact, when October rolls around, most employees begin telling jokes about who'll get released.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the biggest concern for UOL is that there seems to be no vision.  The future of the company almost seems as if it is being decided by a blindfolded man throwing darts. The Communications segment of UOL is currently still shackled to the dial-up ISP business, and after flopping around trying other directions, has now decided to gamble on the mobile broadband sector - except that they are using tech that is already 5 years out-of-date and trying to market it to a demographic that's still confused by cell phones.",

Because of layoffs the threat of losing your job is always looming.  Causes lots of problems not only with morale but with employees being extremely protective of their job responsibilities to the detriment of cross training and inter/intra department collaboration.  \r\n4.  I didn't like the corporate office location.  Woodland Hills is the hottest place in Los Angeles and the traffic is horrendous from every direction.  \r\n5.

      "# [My Gen Z daughter and her Altadena and Pasadena classmates are showing us the way by Najeeba Syeed on 2025-01-16](https://religionnews.com/2025/01/16/my-gen-z-daughter-and-her-altadena-classmates-are-showing-us-the-way/)\n(RNS) — This column is a love letter to the children of Pasadena and Altadena.\n\nI often write about religion and interfaith cooperation in disaster and conflict. This week, as I write this column in tears, my analysis hits home. My children are products of a public school system in which almost 7,000 students lived in the evacuation zone of the Eaton Canyon Fire, and 2,600 in the core burn zone of the same fire. My children spend half their life in Altadena. The neighborhood as of this moment is still closed off; my children still have a home, though the house next door burned down.\n\nWe often worshipped in Altadena and, especially in Ramadan, broke fast in Masjid Al-Taqwa, now only a pile of ash and rubble. In the past, for five years, I ran an organization that served northwest Pasadena and Altadena schools and communities. I lived in the Pasadena area for 15 years. Our connections to these communities are deep and beloved.\n\nMy daughter has been active on Instagram trying her best to raise money for the many friends she knows who have lost their homes. She is awe-inspiring to me. Immediately after hearing from her friends and schoolmates, these teenagers moved into action, sharing GoFundMe’s and other sources.\n\nThey have been out of school for two weeks and have spent every day volunteering at different sites, naturally folding into it without question. They are not interested in photo opportunities — in fact, many seem allergic to pictures of them doing service. Instead, I see them using their powerful tools of social media not to amplify their efforts but to highlight the donation needs of different communities. They are sharing stories that change the narrative of the fires from one that impacted only celebrities and high-income families. Their volunteerism is concentrated in the notion that service is an ethic of care, that compassion is a way of being. These collective efforts offering immediate support and hope for healing are hallmarks of their generation.\n\nAltadena and northwest Pasadena have historically been home to a diverse array of communities — from Black businesses, homes and historic institutions, to powerful Latino churches, to Armenian and other communities. We are all a part of the fabric of greater Pasadena and Altadena. A Jewish synagogue, a mosque and at least three area churches were lost in the fires.\n\nThese are communities rich not in wealth in comparison to some others, but in their celebration of diversity, a place that was open when racism and redlining kept groups from buying property elsewhere.\n\nIt should not be surprising that the children of this community would lead in taking care of their own across faiths, ethnicities and languages. And they are also children of the pandemic. Their eighth grade graduations were full of speeches that talked about the trauma of collective isolation. Even then, they sounded like individuals far beyond their years. They have grown up already in the face of global crises, and when it hit home, their huge hearts and ethical orientations responded to the moment without hesitation.\n\nA teen-led clothing drive in Pasadena at Bravo Salon, for instance, and the Altadena Teen Girls Fire Recovery were organized and fueled by teens. Other teens are serving at organizations they already had connections to, like the Flintridge Center, which is in the heart of the community. Faith-based and public schools, as well as churches and other religious sites, have become centers for teens to organize relief efforts. Many family-owned and local businesses have also been sites for teens to organize relief efforts and activities such as feeding first responders.\n\nI was part of an interfaith vigil organized online this week on Zoom because so many of the families had lost their homes. A Muslim, Jewish and Christian team of clergy and leaders prayed and offered words of wisdom for navigating what will be a long-term recovery for the communities impacted by this tragedy. I offered a caution on making sure theology and religion are not used to blame anyone or communities for the cause of this catastrophe — and instead to focus on our overlapping teachings of healing and hope.\n\nOur teens are doing that in the very practical sense. Their continued service and their steady moral compass make me excited to see the world they will run. A world in which we don’t need a litmus test on your beliefs before we offer care, where your story is important to share no matter which income bracket you come from. A world in which the measure of our humanity is how much we show up for each other with an embodied empathy that asks, “What do you need, dear friend, who I may not know? Let me be there for you.”\n\nThis vision of humanity in crisis contradicts the tropes of a self-centered generation that is concerned only with its own public personas and presentation. It is evidence of a group of young people who, when faced with the gravity of so much loss, chooses connection over isolation, action over apathy, generosity over a scarcity mindset. When one of us flourishes, we all flourish.\n\nIt would be a great way to go into 2025 with this imperative, one that many older generations and, dare I say, policymakers could benefit from in their own work.\n\n(Najeeba Syeed holds the El-Hibri Endowed Chair at Augsburg University in Minneapolis and is executive director of the Interfaith Institute there.

      "# [classmates.com by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2006-04-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classmates.com)\nSocial networking service\n\nclassmates.com is an American social networking service. It was founded on November 17, 1995 by Randy Conrads as Classmates Online, Inc.[2] and headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. It bills itself as the leading online social network service in the United States for bringing high school alumni together, with over 90 million members.[citation needed]\n\nClassmates.com has an archive of over 470,000 old high school yearbooks that have been digitized, and members can purchase yearbook reprints. Other features[3] include private messaging, conversations, class lists and reunion planning.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited Online, Inc. (Nasdaq: UNTD) acquired Classmates Online in 2004[4] and owned and operated the company as part of its Classmates Media Corporation subsidiary[5] until 2015.\n\nIn 2010, Classmates.com changed its name to Memory Lane, which included a website redesign,[6] and included content like movie trailers, songs, and photos. In 2011, Classmates dropped the Memory Lane brand. Classmates Media operated online social networking and loyalty marketing services under the Classmates.com[7] and MyPoints[8] brands, respectively.\n\nIn August 2015, Classmates was acquired by PeopleConnect Holdings, Inc., a portfolio company of H.I.G. Capital, making it the second acquisition after PCH purchases Bellevue, WA-based Intelius, Inc.[9] Classmates is now operated as a division of PeopleConnect,[10] which also owns Intelius.\n\nIn 2020, PeopleConnect completed a merger with The Control Group, a provider of B2C information services located in San Diego, California.[11]\n\nClassmates Media Corporation's business model is based on user-generated content and revenue from paid subscriptions and advertising sales.[4]\n\nAs of 2023, under the PeopleConnect leadership team, including CEO Steven Gray & CFO Sach Barot, the B2C information services division of PeopleConnect operates from the San Diego location. The Classmates division, led by President Sarah Howe, is located in Bellevue, Washington.\n\nUsers and ranking among other social networking sites\n\n[edit]\n\nThe only time Classmates appeared on Hitwise's top 10 list of social networking websites was in June 2009, when it appeared tenth with a 0.45% market share.[12]\n\nIn early 2008, Nielsen Online had ranked Classmates as number three in unique monthly visitors (U.S. home, work) among social networking sites.\n\nAs of June 30, 2008, Classmates Media had more than 50 million members, but only 3.8 million paying subscribers.\n\nIn 2006, television program The View mentioned Classmates.com as having more than 40 million[13] members in the United States and Canada.\n\nAccording to the Online Publishers Association Paid Content U.S. Market Spending Report, Classmates.com was Number 4 among the Top 25 Web Destinations Ranked by Consumer Content Revenue in both 2002 and 2003[14] (the last years that individual site rankings were broken out). As more users have moved to Facebook, the site has fallen in popularity. Classmates.com was one of the first social networks.[citation needed]\n\nAs of 2015 (the year the company turned 20), Classmates had over 70 million current members.[15]\n\nPrivacy\n\n[edit]\n\nClassmates.com members use real names,[16] not screen names, including maiden names. Member privacy is protected through a double-blind email system, so email addresses and contact information are never revealed unless self-disclosed by members one-on-one.\n\nDigital yearbook collection\n\n[edit]\n\nClassmates.com has an archive of over 470,000 yearbooks from the US, some dating back to the 1880s. This represents the world’s largest (and continually growing) digital yearbook collection. Classmates.com acquires these yearbooks and then scans them, creating digital copies that can be viewed online. Many of these yearbooks are available to purchase in hardcover or softcover reprints.\n\nThe oldest yearbook on site is from 1886, from Central High School, Manchester, NH.[17]\n\nReunions\n\n[edit]\n\nClassmates.com members can plan and attend reunions on-site. In 2020, Classmates.com also rolled out the virtual reunion feature so that schoolmates can get together without having to travel, which was a new option during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2022, Classmates.com users organized over 30,000 reunions on the site.[citation needed]\n\nIn the media\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a Yahoo! Life UK article on July 8, 2022, the costume designer of the Netflix show Stranger Things was reported as telling Australia’s Harpers Bazaar magazine, \"We looked at real kids from the period. I spent lots of time on Classmates.com, which has assorted yearbooks, gathering images of real students in different parts of the country. I also found lots of D&D club group photos which lent lots of inspiration for the Hellfire Club.\"[18]\n\nIn October 2022, Insider Magazine[19] used celebrity yearbook photos for an article, many of which came from the Classmates.com yearbook archive.\n\nIn June 2023, People Magazine also used Classmates.com[20] celebrity yearbook photos for an article.\n\nClassmates.com has also been in the media[21][22] for high school romance connections.\n\nLegal allegations\n\n[edit]\n\n5 District Attorneys in CA (including LA) filed a consumer protection lawsuit – Classmates updated its subscription renewal disclosures and settled the claim.[23]\n\nEmail settlement\n\n[edit]\n\nClassmates.com was alleged to have sent emails that told recipients their old friends from school wished to reconnect (and the recipients would need to buy Classmates.com memberships to receive their old friends' contact information). A class action lawsuit was brought against Classmates.com in 2008. The lead plaintiffs in the case were David Catapano and Anthony Michaels.[24] Classmates.com agreed to pay $2.5 million to its users to settle the lawsuit.[25]\n\nPiggybacking and post-transaction marketing\n\n[edit]\n\nClassmates.com was accused of piggybacking and post-transaction marketing.[26] Parent company United Online earned $70 million from marketing practices under investigation in 2009 by the Senate Commerce Committee. United Online denied the allegations and maintained that customers were provided clear disclosures before agreeing to transactions.[27]\n\nSettlement on hidden online shopping fees\n\n[edit]\n\nOn August 18, 2010, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced a settlement with six companies, including Classmates, as part of a probe into the discount club industry. Classmates were among the retailers that agreed to pay $2.1 million toward refunds and consumer education.[28] Under the alleged practice investigated, consumers who completed online purchases were presented with discounts or cash-back offers, and accepting these offers triggered small, easy-to-overlook recurring charges billed to unfamiliar company names. Classmates' share of the settlement amounts to $960,000 and a commitment to end these practices.[29]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nNames Database, owned by Classmates.com\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",
      "# [Ode to my male classmates by Ella Duggan, Madison McMahon on 2024-12-12](https://berkeleybeacon.com/ode-to-my-male-classmates/)\nIn writing workshops, I don’t expect perfection, but I do expect to be able to tolerate reading the majority of the stories. In the writing, literature, and publishing major at Emerson College, though, men do not make up the majority.\n\nIt is my third semester witnessing a man fail to repress a smirk as he proudly raises his hand and taps his foot while he waits to present his story. When, to his relief, he is finally called on, he reads out a section that causes me physical pain. And it’s not just from the volume of his voice, obviously—you would think intentionally—decibels louder than any other voice in the room. Nope, the story is just bad.\n\nWhat makes a story “bad” can be subjective. More often than not, though, my male classmates turned in work that was the antithesis of everything the professor taught. These stories ranged from being clones of popular novels, to having little to no understanding of pacing, and featuring characters with as much dimension as the piece of paper wasted to print the story. Criticisms of their pieces are spoken to them so sickeningly sweetly that they might as well be compliments.\n\nThe women, though, they get full frontal honesty. This would be acceptable in a void, but in comparison to the praise of their floundering male counterparts, it ups the stakes to never, ever fail. After all, if their worst is praised and your best is shredded, what else can you do but be perfect?\n\nYou may be thinking I am the bad writer here as this is supposed to be an ode, a type of writing defined by its praise and adoration of the subject. But whether I’m the bad writer or the select men in my classes are is not the focus of this ode. It’s their confidence.\n\nWeek after week I watch men stroll into classes, proudly proclaiming they finished the assignment the night before and waiting to be showered in compliments. And they get them. They’ve set the bar so low, with a late night cram or an annoyingly loud voice, that when there is a fraction of something good, everyone scrambles to fawn over it. As for their idiocy, it is treated like a cute quirk.\n\nWhy can’t I be stupid?\n\nWomen are not granted the same leniency. We do not have the space to fail. Failing immediately aligns us with the stereotype of being subpar at everything except domestic tasks. We are no longer thought of when an opportunity arises and word of mouth in regards to our capability perpetuates this unhirable status. So, we gruel over pressurizing our coal—our work—until it becomes a diamond, or it breaks.\n\nThe problem with this is that failing is how anyone learns. Women stalling their progress by only accepting perfection, terrified to risk trying something new out of fear of failure, stifles the same creativity that men get to throw at the wall like toddlers with spaghetti.\n\nI want that same freedom. I want to be able to write a bad piece without watching my classmates whisper to one another that I have defined myself, forever, as a bad writer. I want to present a bad piece and be treated like I have potential. Like there is room for growth. Like my effort, my risk—if not the composition of the story itself—is respected. Just like the men in my class.\n\nThis is not just a problem for the writing, literature, and publishing major. In Emerson College as a whole, women literally take up more space by being 68% of the school’s population. Yet, that is not reflected in the microcosms of the classrooms where the men constantly interrupt women and female-presenting people.\n\nI have talked to friends in different majors—VMA, comedic arts, and journalism—and while their interactions are structured differently with filming on sets, improving scenes, or co-writing articles, the one throughline is a lack of shame on the men’s part.\n\nIn a film class, one man presented a highly-sexualized short film of a young woman’s mental unraveling. One man in comedic arts argued with a woman about the viability of a sexist comedy special he had not seen that the woman had. One man in journalism even claimed the all-female staff of an organization was sexist for not hiring him.\n\nJust a note: men can not experience sexism because sexism is a systemic issue based on the social, political, and economic power that men have held for centuries. It would take 500 consistent years of male oppression for it to be correct to use the definition of “sexist” in regards to a woman.\n\nWhile men on campus feel emboldened enough to be outwardly sexist, or just plain rude, women struggle to get by if a comma is out of place. It makes me sad to think of all the things women could have accomplished if they were nurtured to be just as confident as men.\n\nI am not arguing for the silence of all men all the time. If the men reading this could reflect on anything familiar in this piece, and I mean really, honestly reflect—because remember, your intention behind an action does not equal its impact—and stop doing said thing, that would be quite helpful.\n\nHowever, I anticipate there will be many men who feel this does not apply to them and go about their day, mucking up every other woman’s. I have no control over them. I have control over me. Which is why I am going to start failing. Loudly.\n\nBy failing, I mean I am going to raise my hand to answer a question even if I am not positive I have the correct answer. I am going to let myself stutter when I speak, and say lots of “ums.” I am going to switch points of view in the middle of a fiction piece because I have always wanted to try that. I am not going to sugar-coat my feedback out of fear a man will yell at me over it. Because yes, that did happen.\n\nThrough all that mess is curiosity, intelligence, and creativity trying to formulate themselves.\n\nIt is not my, nor any woman’s, responsibility to fix the problem men created, but I can flop and flail my way out of their trap until my spaghetti art on the wall turns into a Van Gogh.\n\nSo to my male classmates, thank you for setting this example. Be prepared to watch me fail louder.",

      "# [Friends, classmates remember student found slain at UGA as neighbors describe suspect’s arrest by Marissa Parra, Rebecca Cohen on 2024-02-25](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/friends-classmates-remember-student-found-slain-uga-neighbors-describe-rcna140363)\nATHENS, Georgia — Days after Laken Hope Riley was found dead on the University of Georgia campus, friends and classmates are remembering the 22-year-old as a kind young woman who “brought so many people together.”\n\nBianca Tiller, who roomed with Riley during their freshman year at UGA, said, “She was the sweetest, most pure-hearted young woman” who “brought so many people together and developed so many friendships.”\n\n“I came into UGA knowing less than a handful of people and she brought me into her friend group, never let me feel left out,” Tiller said about Riley. “She made everyone smile and and is such a kind soul.”\n\n“The great thing about Laken, everyone she met could instantly tell what a great heart she was,” Tiller added.\n\nTiller said her former roommate loved to run and kept track of her runs on her Apple Watch. Riley always shared her phone’s location with her friends, Tiller said.\n\nRiley’s body was found with “visible injuries” in a forested area behind Lake Herrick on Thursday, police have said. She had gone out for a jog at the Intramural Fields that morning, and when she didn’t return hours later, her friend called the police.\n\nRiley died of blunt force trauma.\n\nThe suspect, identified as Jose Antonio Ibarra, 26, of Athens, has been charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, police said Friday.\n\nThere was no indication that Ibarra and Riley knew each other, according to UGA Police Chief Jeff Clark, who called it a “crime of opportunity” and said there was no further threat to the campus. Ibarra was being held in the Clarke County Jail.\n\nRoommates, friends remember Riley as selfless, loving\n\nLilly Steiner, another friend from UGA, thanked Riley in a tribute posted Saturday on Instagram for “helping me find the joy in life.”\n\n“You put everyone before yourself everyday, and you loved like no one else,” Sofia Magana, one of Riley’s roommates at UGA, said on Instagram.\n\n“You were supposed to be by my side on my wedding day, you were supposed to be with us on graduation ... but most importantly you were supposed to be here with us,” Magana wrote.\n\nSophia Palomino said in a tribute post that Riley “taught me so many lessons about life, friendship & sisterhood” and that “her love has changed me for the better.” She added that she admired how Riley was always putting others before herself.\n\nConnolly Huth, who also lived with Riley, recalled their shared memories and said she and Riley were supposed to run their first marathon together.\n\n“I will run that 26.2 in your honor and let everyone know of the perfect, beautiful, hilarious, smart, kind, and driven human that Laken Riley was,” Huth wrote in an Instagram post.\n\nRiley attended the University of Georgia through the spring 2023 semester and was studying at nearby Augusta University College of Nursing at the time of her death. In a statement, the school called her “a promising future nurse” who made the dean’s list in the fall.\n\nA GoFundMe page was set up in Riley’s honor to help her family with funeral costs and with hopes of starting a scholarship in her name.\n\nCommunity reeling from Riley’s death\n\nOn Saturday, security waited outside the Alpha Chi Omega sorority house, where Riley was still an active member, as students with flowers in their hands rushed to and from their cars, heads down and focused, wearing a grim look.\n\nThe tension on the campus Saturday was palpable.\n\nOne student clutched pepper spray as she crossed the street. She said up until this week, it was gathering dust in her car.\n\nA small memorial grew by Lake Herrick, where Riley was last seen alive, as well as by the famed UGA arch. Students who never met Riley gave it a somber acknowledgement as they walked past.\n\n“It’s really upsetting. I know that I love to run, and so to know that that could’ve been me, that could’ve been anyone on this campus, it’s just terrible. It could be anybody,” UGA student Millicent Dye said.\n\nA quiet fear also lurks just off campus among a pocket of Venezuelans living in Athens.\n\nFrom outside Andreina Rivas’ apartment in the same community as Ibarra, she described in Spanish the shock and fear of seeing police swarming her street, only to find out it was because the suspect, whom she’d never met, was living just down the road from her.\n\nRivas threw her hands up in frustration, re-enacting the moment she said she found out the suspect’s family was Venezuelan, like her.\n\nRivas said that in a group chat with other Venezuelans, some expressed fears that locals would “come after Venezuelans.”\n\nSuspect’s brother also facing legal trouble\n\nThe suspect’s brother, Diego Ibarra, 29, was also taken into custody Friday and federally charged with possessing a fraudulent green card, according to a release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Georgia.\n\nDiego Ibarra is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela, the U.S. attorney’s office said. He was also being held in the Clarke County Jail. It was not immediately clear if he had retained legal representation.\n\nHe was approached by police Friday because he matched the description of the suspect in the investigation into Riley’s death, the U.S. attorney’s office said. He allegedly showed officers his fake green card as a form of identification.\n\nPolice determined the card to be fraudulent and charged Diego Ibarra. He is being held in state custody and faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if convicted, according to the U.S. attorney’s office.\n\nA spokesperson for UGA said he was fired from his position at the university after they learned of the alleged fake green card.\n\n“Diego Ibarra presented a fake green card to the hiring unit to begin a temporary position as a dishwasher in Bolton Dining Hall at the University of Georgia on Feb. 6, 2024,” the spokesperson said. “He subsequently failed to submit further documentation required to keep the job and was never paid by the University.”\n\nHe has been arrested three times on nonviolent offenses since he came to the U.S., according to the U.S. attorney’s office.\n\nJose Ibarra’s arrest has started a political firestorm within the conservative movement regarding immigration and border policy.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp demanded answers from President Joe Biden on Ibarra’s immigration status and asylum claims by his brother.\n\n“Laken Riley’s tragic death struck the hearts of Georgians everywhere and has rightfully sparked national outrage,” Kemp said in a statement. “As I have said many times before: every state is now a border state because of Joe Biden’s inaction, and today I am again demanding answers and information from the Biden Administration that will help us protect our citizens when the federal government will not.”\n\nJose Ibarra is not a U.S. citizen, police said. His immigration status was not clear. A public defender who represented Ibarra at a bond hearing did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Sunday.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Ibarra was arrested by Customs and Border Protection on Sept. 8, 2022, after unlawfully entering the country near El Paso, Texas.\n\nHe was paroled and released for further processing, but was arrested on Sept. 14, 2023, by the New York Police Department and charged with “acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation,” ICE said.\n\nThe NYPD released Ibarra before ICE could issue a detainer — a request that a law enforcement agency keep hold of non-citizens who have been arrested on criminal charges and are eligible for deportation so that ICE can take them into custody — the immigration agency said.\n\nICE said it issued a detainer for Ibarra following his arrest Friday.\n\nSuspect’s neighbors recall police swarming complex\n\nJennifer Slonaker and Ricky Carter, husband and wife, live in the Argo Apartment Community in Athens in one of the units above where Ibarra was living.\n\n“We’d see him out and about. There wasn’t a lot of conversation because we think he spoke Spanish. Nothing out of the ordinary. They seemed normal enough, everyone in that apartment. Three men and a woman,” Slonaker said.\n\nAround noon Friday, the couple said they saw police swarm the complex.\n\n“There wasn’t an inch of this place that didn’t have a cop on it. … They knocked and search every door in this complex, but they started with the one downstairs. They knew what and who they were looking for,” Slonaker said.\n\nThe couple described seeing Ibarra walk away in handcuffs. He didn’t look around, remained quiet and focused ahead of him, they said. His brother Diego followed in handcuffs shortly thereafter.\n\nSlonaker and her husband spoke to NBC News from outside their apartment, sharing details in between drags on a cigarette. Their regular smoke breaks are, in part, why they noticed the forensics team downstairs didn’t leave Ibarra’s apartment until 2:30 Saturday morning.\n\nCarter looked around, almost hesitating to keep his voice from traveling downstairs for a moment.\n\n“Makes me feel some type of way you can be amongst a killer and not even know it,” he said.\n\nMarissa Parra reported from Athens, Georgia, and Rebecca Cohen from New York City.",

So I was really excited about just having my class be part of where I'm heading next, you know?\" the Arkansas boy told \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nLuke's May 14 adoption was the culmination of months of bonding, a process he and his parents, Cassie and Bradley Kissinger, said was nearly instantaneous after they first met at a \"connection event\" hosted by Project Zero, an Arkansas nonprofit dedicated to promoting adoption.\n\n\"We started playing games at the event and those events can be a little awkward but it was actually not at all with [Luke],\" Cassie Kissinger recalled. \"I just kind of jumped in and started helping him with things and we walked around and we talked a lot. We got lunch together. So all the awkwardness went away really quickly.\"\n\nFor Cassie Kissinger, adopting Luke has been a longtime dream come true.\n\n\"I grew up in a family that fostered and adopted out of foster care. So I always wanted to do that. That was a dream of mine since I was a teenager,\" she told \"GMA.\"\n\nOn his adoption day, Luke said he was nervous, excited and overall, felt \"all the feelings combined.\"\n\n\"It was really fun but we had emotional parts too,\" he said.\n\nNow, the rising fifth grader calls Cassie and Bradley Kissinger mom and dad and also has a brother Aiden, also 11, and an older sister Alena, 14.\n\nAiden told \"GMA\" \"it's pretty exciting\" to welcome a brother into the Kissinger family fold.\n\n\"I mean, it gets annoying like other siblings, but we get along pretty well,\" he said, adding that he particularly enjoys playing video games with Luke or playing outside together in their backyard.\n\nThe Kissingers say for other families considering adoption, it's a journey that's well worth it.\n\n\"The kids don't want perfect. They don't need perfect. They just need someone to love them,\" Cassie Kissinger said. \"A lot of these kids have been waiting many years in foster care to be adopted and find a permanent family and it can truly change the trajectory of their life if they find that permanency.\"\n\n\"If you actually look at the statistics, the number of kids out there that just need some love is staggering.

Would we still know one another? Would the magic of Venice hold?\n\nFortunately, the answer was yes.\n\nWhile there had been pounds gained, hair lost and wrinkles added, the bonds of friendship still held strong and were only deepened by time together in the place where they had been forged.\n\nVenice, of course, seemed hardly to have changed. The city isn’t called La Serenissima (“the most serene”) for nothing. With its dazzling interplay of light and water against stone and sky, Venice seems to defy time, gazing eternally upon itself. But under the surface, things do change. Nearly half of the city’s population has left since we were there four decades ago, driven out by sky-high rents and the ever-rising costs of goods and services.\n\nToday’s local population of 50,000 is left to absorb the nearly 20 million visitors who crowd the city’s three square miles each year. And while the emerald-hued waters that surround the city continue to shimmer, they also continue to rise.\n\nStill, Venice is a place of dreams, and I had come back to see if they still appertained to me, and if my children – now the age I was when I first came here – felt the same.\n\nIn 1984, our group of 20-odd students lived at Casa Artom, a modest palazzo (by Venetian standards) on the Grand Canal owned by Wake Forest University and couched beside the Peggy Guggenheim Collection of modern art. It was a “dream” location. Many an evening, I heard gondoliers row past my bedroom window, singing to lovebirds in their boats.\n\nDecades later, we former students had to find our own accommodations. They ranged from the steep end (the Hotel Danieli, just off the Piazza San Marco, starting at $800 a night) to the somewhat less steep (Hotel Molino Stucky, on the island of Giudecca opposite San Marco, starting at $200) to independent hotels and Airbnbs.\n\nMany reunion-goers opted for the Molino Stucky, a Hilton-owned property that is one of the few hotels in the city that can accommodate large groups. (Our group included 12 former students, plus partners, families and friends.) The hotel’s rooftop bar and cupola offer stunning views across the lagoon to the rooftops of San Marco and beyond.\n\nMy family and I chose to stay in the city center, in a charming old world Airbnb owned by a Venetian family and located off the major tourist paths in the Cannaregio district, just north of Saint Mark’s Square and a short walk from the Rialto Bridge. At $170 a night for four people, it seemed a steal and put us in the middle of an authentic, bustling, Venetian neighborhood.\n\nIn the narrow alleyway in front of our flat each morning, we saw uniformed children headed to school, grannies returning from the panificio (bakery) and the fruitivendolo (fruit vendor), and workmen coming and going. At the neighborhood café, we sampled favorite Venetian sweets, including zaeti, a rectangular cookie made of cornmeal and raisins. After a delicious, cappucino or latte – recalling that Venice was home to some of the first coffee shops in Europe – we were on our way to San Marco or the Rialto within minutes.\n\nOur reunion group had a shared itinerary for the three days that we would be together in the Lagoon City. Our timing was excellent: In late May, Venice is warm, breezy and sunny. It is also the season of the Biennale, the famed international cultural festival, when Venice hosts the best in contemporary art and architecture from around the world (alternating between the two each year). Many in our group took advantage of the opportunity to see the latest world art housed in some of the city’s grandest and most historic buildings.\n\nThe reunion itself began with an evening at Casa Artom, where we shared memories of our time together 40 years ago, including tributes to the beloved professor and mentor who had brought us together in this place (late WFU Associate Dean Patricia Johansson).\n\nOur itinerary began in earnest the following day with a behind-the-scenes tour of the 17th-century Church of San Sebastiano, a Baroque jewel in the Dorsoduro district of Venice built after plagues ravaged the city in the medieval and early modern eras. Known for its cycle of wall frescoes and ceiling paintings by Venetian Renaissance master Paolo Veronese (who is buried there), the church has been under extensive restoration since 2007 by the American-based conservation group Save Venice. (The organization’s local director is a Wake Forest alumnus.)\n\nVisitors to the church can see Veronese masterpieces, including monumental paintings from the life of Saint Sebastian, a Coronation of the Virgin and scenes from the biblical story of Esther, restored to their full glory, as they would have appeared when the master was at work there in the 1550s. Especially striking are the figures’ colors and raiment – deep azure blues, vibrant greens, and subtle rose – set within the church’s architectural splendor, partly the work of Veronese, too.\n\nVenice is, of course, a city built on islands – over 100 of them! The only way to get around is by boat or on foot.\n\nOur group booked a “Hidden Venice” tour that took us through some of the city’s most ancient but least visited alleyways and campi (small squares), past the famed Palazzo Contarini del Bovolo with its famed external spiral staircase (the Scala Contarini), to the watery back door of La Fenice, Venice’s grand opera house. First built in the 1790s, but twice ravaged by fires that damaged its sumptuous interior (the last, and most destructive, in 1996), La Fenice (“The Phoenix”) rose from the flames to host premieres of operas by the likes of Verdi, Rossini, Stravinsky and Benjamin Britten. Opera stars used to arrive there by gondola, pulling up to the theater’s watery back gate. Today, non-performing visitors can keep their shoes dry while touring the restored opera house’s magnificent gold and stucco interior or taking in one of its world-class productions.\n\nA highlight of our reunion was a guided evening tour of St. Mark’s basilica, one of Venice’s (and Europe’s) most famous landmarks, now over 1.000 years old.\n\nAs students, we had seen the magnificent, onion-domed church in the daytime, joining throngs of tourists who crowd its vast interior. But we had never seen it like this, when the basilica’s grand, jeweled spaces offered themselves to us alone.\n\nKnown for its over 43,000 square feet of glittering mosaics (mostly 12th and 13th century) spread across walls, floors, and the interior of five massive domes, St. Mark’s is truly a feast for the eyes. Sliding through the church’s ornate Romanesque doorways, we encountered the biblical story of creation, told in a dizzying swirl of color and concentric circles on the ceiling of the atrium. Then, entering the dimly lit caverns of the nave itself, we found ourselves gazing up at the magnificent Pentecost Dome (early 12th century), where the Holy Spirit shoots its golden flames of fire onto the heads of the 12 apostles, as told in the New Testament book of Acts.\n\nFarther on, beneath the massive Ascension Dome at the transept, we sat on benches and gazed up at the image of Christ seated in glory, surrounded by his mother, angels and apostles, in a great swirl of golden light.\n\nAs we peered upward, our guide suddenly turned out the lights, surrounding us in complete and utter darkness for a couple of minutes. No one spoke.\n\nThen, one by one, our guide began to turn spotlights on individual mosaics and pieces of artwork – a jeweled collection of saints over here, a group of apostles there, a series of ornate, 13th-century carvings in front of us, the sparkling dome above. It was as if all of the mosaics and the artwork in the church were coming to life before our eyes. I looked over at our 20-year-old twins, silently engrossed by the majesty of the spectacle. It seemed a transcendent moment shared by all of us.\n\nI thought of that experience when, at the end of the reunion, our family visited the quiet island of Torcello, birthplace of Venice, across the lagoon from the bustling tourist city. Established in the sixth century by Romans fleeing barbarian invasions on the mainland, Torcello (population 20) boasts the oldest building in the Venetian lagoon – the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta, begun in the seventh century.\n\nWe found Save Venice at work there, too, restoring the church’s 11th-century, geometric-patterned mosaic floor. (The cathedral’s mosaics are among the oldest in the Venetian lagoon, and like all such artwork, suffer especially from the area’s damp, humid climate and the salty lagoon environment.)\n\nRecent work by Save Venice has brought new luster to mosaic cycles in the church’s central and side apses, too, which may have been crafted originally by artisans from Constantinople. Especially striking is the giant, slender figure of the Virgin Mary in resplendent blue at the top of the central apse in the east end of the church. Holding the Christ child in her arms, she looks out at us with a kind of serene bemusement. The emotions are very different on the monumental, six-tier “Last Judgment” cycle that covers the west wall opposite, near the entrance to the cathedral. There, amid a series of busy scenes, a giant Christ pulls Adam out of Limbo by the wrist as, several levels below, demons drag sinners down to Hell and the already-damned burn in red-hot flames.\n\nOutside the cathedral stands a tall, 11th-century campanile or bell tower, offering broad views of the surrounding island, lagoon and mainland. I knew that, over the centuries, it had hosted an array of notable visitors, including art historian John Ruskin, novelist Henry James, and writer Ernest Hemingway, who lived on Torcello for a short period of time.\n\nOur family followed in their footsteps up the circular stone staircase for a view from the top before departing the historic island. In his classic work of art history \"The Stones of Venice,\" Ruskin describes that view, near sunset, as “one of the most notable scenes in this wide world.”\n\nRomantically depicting the “waste of wild sea moor” below the tower, Ruskin enjoined his readers and fellow travelers, like us, to look out beyond Torcello itself to the “misty band of mountains, touched with snow” to the northwest (The Italian Alps), the “roar of the Adriatic” to the east, and to the south, “beyond the widening branches of the lagoon ... rising out of the bright lake into which they gather . . . a multitude of towers, dark and scattered among square-set shapes of clustered palaces.”\n\nLooking out over the marshlands of Torcello and across the turquoise-green waters of the lagoon, we could just make out “the multitude of towers” that was Venice. It seemed magical, even in the afternoon sun.\n\nAs we climbed back down the narrow tower stairs and towards the end of our time in Venice, I recognized that the city was still a place of dreams.\n\nI had first arrived there alone, as a young man for whom the future was open, but uncertain. I had returned years later as an older man with a wife and children who could experience the magic of the place for themselves, while I looked on in knowing wonder.\n\nThat, certainly, was a dream in itself.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nGet the latest from Winston-Salem Monthly right in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our twice-monthly Winston-Salem Magazine newsletter.\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

      "# [Long Lost UNOH Classmates Reconnect by UNOH News Center](https://news.unoh.edu/2024/08/Long%20Lost%20UNOH%20Classmates%20Reconnect.html)\nPosted on Sunday, August 18, 2024\n\nWritten by Contributing Columnist Melanie Barnas-Simmons\n\nAlumni from the 80’s and 90’s didn’t have social media to keep them connected the way UNOH graduates do today. Andy Casperson of Norton Shores, MI was one of them. Andy graduated with his Automotive Diesel Technician Degree in late 1986. He started out working at dealerships and private auto shops, then became a master mechanic managing a fleet. After 12 years, he decided to make a career change and became a firefighter. His knowledge of mechanics came in handy working on the fleet of fire trucks. After retiring in 2022, he started thinking how great it would be to reconnect with some of his college classmates.\n\nThe UNOH Alumni Relations Department was able to reach out on his behalf and get Andy in touch with old friends he met during an Aerobics class on campus. Kendra Thatcher Heckman of Decatur, IN, and Karla Linn Erman of Delphos, OH. were thrilled to hear from their old volleyball and bowling buddy.\n\nThe three recently met up on the family farm where Kendra and her husband live. Andy and his wife camped for the night on their way to Eldora Speedway.\n\nKendra said, “At first, I was worried about what we would talk about as it’s been so long since we’ve seen each other, but once we got going, it was just like old times.”\n\nKendra and Karla both studied in the medical administrative assistant program at what was then called Northwestern College. Kendra worked for St. Rita’s before graduating and landed a job closer to home at Bluffton Regional Medical Center. She has been there ever since, working in a secretarial role in the outpatient therapy department.\n\nKarla’s first job after college was actually with UNOH in the career placement center. From there, she went to Graybar Electric in Lima in a customer service role. After ten years in that position, she moved to Kindred Healthcare as a staff coordinator. After 20 years in that role, she returned to Graybar, where she is today.\n\nThe three look forward to the next time they can get together and perhaps expand their group to include a few more old friends.\n\n“It was great for me to see how well each is doing and how their families are growing.” Explained Andy. “I am confident we will keep in touch and get together at least once a year or more.”\n\nCategory: Campus & Community",
      "# [Breaking barriers: Child Life classmates lean on each other as program’s first Black students](https://www.fcs.uga.edu/news/story/breaking-barriers-child-life-classmates-lean-on-each-other-as-programs-first-black-students)\nOver a boxed lunch during a stressful weekend, Aspen Thompson made a new friend.\n\nIn Athens to interview for acceptance into the College of Family and Consumer Sciences’ competitive master’s of science in Child Life program last winter, Thompson admitted she was a little “spooked” by the process.\n\nWhen the candidates met for lunch, Thompson settled into a seat next to JaQuira Wallace. As the two began chatting, a light-hearted exchange marked the beginning of what would become a unique friendship.\n\n“We were joking because she doesn’t like sweets,” Thompson said. “I love sweets, so I traded my fruit for her cookie.”\n\nThompson and Wallace soon discovered more commonalities.\n\nThey both come from military backgrounds. Both of Thompson’s parents were officers in the Navy in California and Texas before retiring to Virginia. Wallace’s father recently retired from a career in the Air Force in South Carolina.\n\nThey learned they shared a Christian faith and they both have wrestled with perfectionist tendencies.\n\nAmong a few other common threads, Thompson and Wallace also have another obvious connection: they’re both Black students, possibly the program’s first in its 30-year history, pursuing a career as Child Life Specialists where Black practitioners make up just 11 percent of the field nationwide.\n\n“We have a lot of shared passions, dreams, convictions and experiences when it comes to being a Black student in general,” Thompson said. “It’s just another layer of closeness, and it’s easy to feel like we’re collaborating and spurring each other on.”\n\n'I just want to help'\n\nChild Life Specialists serve a unique role in the healthcare field. They typically work in hospitals, supporting the psychosocial needs of children and families to help them understand their illness or injury and develop positive coping skills.\n\nFaculty member Diane Bales, professor and UGA Cooperative Extension human development specialist, directs the FACS program, with clinical assistant professor Stephanie Whitten serving as clinical coordinator.\n\nA recent class focused on death and bereavement in which students were presented the following case study:\n\n“You’ve been working in oncology. When you arrive for work, you find out that a 14-year-old boy you have seen on and off for a year died the night before. You tear up when you see his parents. What do you say and do?”\n\nThe students’ discussions covered issues like self-care, establishing professional boundaries and being genuine with children and families.\n\nWhile acknowledging the heaviness of certain aspects of the job, Wallace said she’s convinced she’s exactly where she’s meant to be.\n\n“It sounds cliché, but I just want to help,” she said. “It’s always been a goal of mine to be an advocate for children any way I can. I want to be that person rooting for them when it feels like they don’t have anybody rooting for them.”\n\nWallace’s passion for the field grew out of watching her mother’s interactions with kids in her preschool classroom. Later, an advisor in Wallace’s undergraduate program at the College of Charleston recommended Child Life, and Wallace’s path was set.\n\n“I did my research and thought ‘I could really see myself being successful in this field,’ ” she said.\n\nThompson earned an undergraduate degree in pre-clinical public health at Liberty University, where she also played volleyball, but discovered a passion for Child Life when a family friend’s young son was diagnosed with leukemia.\n\n“His mom just raved about the Child Life specialists on his care team and how it had made such a big difference,” Thompson said. “I had no idea that job had a name, but I really knew that was something I felt called to do and was the sweet spot between my love for medicine and my passion for serving and supporting.”\n\nTheir paths converged at UGA, where they joined a small cohort of four first-year students in the rigorous program in which students are required to complete an internship at a hospital and are then eligible to sit for the Child Life Certification Exam.\n\nIn short, it’s a lot. Both Wallace and Thompson say they’ve been stretched in the program and lean on each other for comfort and encouragement.\n\n“I firmly believe God put Aspen and me in this program together to develop a friendship and be intentional and talk about our experiences as Black students and Black women, and I really appreciate that,” Wallace said. “I know she will always be there for me.”\n\nA culture of support\n\nDiversifying the field of Child Life is a priority for many programs, including FACS.\n\nAccording to the careers website Zippia, 60 percent of Certified Child Life Specialists identify as white and 75 percent are women.\n\nWallace said she has tried to find other Black practitioners on LinkedIn, but has been unsuccessful.\n\n“I’m hoping that’s something that can change,” she said.\n\nWhitten agrees.\n\n“Minority representation in the field of Child Life is vital to diversifying the workforce,” she said. “When children and families see individuals who look like them or share similar backgrounds, they feel more understood and supported, which can positively impact their emotional well-being throughout hospitalization.”\n\nWhile acknowledging the importance of recognizing the gap for existing practitioners of color, Thompson said one of the strengths of the FACS program is the open atmosphere fostered by Bales and Whitten.\n\n“There are so many people rooting for you here,” Thompson said. “Everybody is invited to share and give perspective without it feeling like you’re being called out or embarrassed.”\n\nWallace has had a similar experience. She said she’s had encouraging conversations with both Bales and Whitten about the issue and is optimistic about the future based on her experience at UGA.\n\n“I’ve just really felt comfortable here,” she said. “It feels like a family to me.”",
