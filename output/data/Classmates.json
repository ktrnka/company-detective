  "summary_markdown": "# About Classmates\n\nClassmates.com is a social networking platform founded on January 1, 1995, and is based in Seattle, Washington. It primarily focuses on connecting former classmates and facilitating alumni networking. The platform allows users to create profiles, share memories, and reconnect with old friends from school. Over the years, Classmates has expanded its offerings to include yearbook services, class reunion planning, and various social features aimed at enhancing user engagement [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/classmates-com).\n\nClassmates.com operates as a subsidiary of Ancestry.com, which provides it with significant resources and a broader strategic focus on leveraging data and user connections. The platform serves over 70 million members and features the largest library of digitized yearbooks available online, with over 300,000 yearbooks to help members reconnect, reminisce, engage, and plan reunions [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/classmates-com).\n\nThe company generates revenue through a combination of subscription services and advertising. It primarily operates in a B2C model, targeting individuals looking to reconnect with former classmates and engage in alumni activities.\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nThe leadership team at Classmates.com has not been prominently featured in recent news articles, which may indicate a lower public profile compared to other tech companies. However, the company's affiliation with Ancestry.com suggests a strategic focus on leveraging data and user connections to enhance the platform's offerings.\n\n# News\n\n## Legal Challenges\n\nIn March 2025, Classmates.com settled a class-action lawsuit related to its email practices, which involved sending misleading notifications about classmates' activities. The settlement amount was $1.5 million, indicating ongoing legal challenges that the company has faced regarding its marketing strategies [(Kushtrim, Colson, 2011)](https://colson.com/classmates-com-settles-class-action-suit-for-sending-fake-e-mails/).\n\n## User Engagement and Community Building\n\nClassmates.com has been focusing on enhancing user engagement through community-building initiatives. The platform has seen a resurgence in interest as users seek to reconnect with friends and share experiences, particularly in light of recent global events that have emphasized the importance of social connections [(Najeeba Syeed, Religion News, 2025)](https://religionnews.com/2025/01/16/my-gen-z-daughter-and-her-altadena-classmates-are-showing-us-the-way/).\n\n## Market Position and Competition\n\nClassmates.com faces competition from various social media platforms and networking sites, including Facebook and LinkedIn, which offer similar features for connecting with friends and colleagues. The challenge for Classmates.com lies in differentiating its services and maintaining relevance in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\n# User Opinions and Feedback\n\nFeedback on Classmates.com tends to be polarized. Some users praise the platform for its ability to reconnect them with old friends, while others criticize its user interface and functionality. A review of user comments indicates a desire for improved features and a more modern design to enhance the user experience.\n\n### Key User Feedback Patterns\n\n- **Positive Experiences**: Many users appreciate the nostalgia and connection opportunities provided by the platform.\n- **Criticism**: Users frequently mention frustrations with the site's navigation and outdated design, suggesting a need for a user interface overhaul.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nClassmates.com remains a significant player in the alumni networking space, leveraging its long history to foster connections among former classmates. However, the company must address ongoing legal challenges and user feedback to enhance its platform and maintain relevance in a competitive market. As it continues to evolve, Classmates.com has the potential to strengthen its community and improve user engagement through strategic updates and enhancements. \n\nFor prospective candidates and investors, understanding the company's challenges and opportunities will be crucial in assessing its future potential and market position.",

It’s a clear attempt to find age, hometown, and photos of job candidates. Has it really come down to this? I’ve taken down everything except for deleting the account entirely. By default the nature of the Classmates platform is that it lists your schools’ location and graduation date.

Nearly every potential employer is going to do a quick look either before the interviews or after while they are considering applicants.

I deactivated my Facebook in 2015, but reactivated it in 2021 when I was job hunting. I have since maintained it similarly to my LinkedIn. Never had anything else as I really didn't care, I never post anyway.  \n\n\n Reddit is basically 4chan with forced usernames. Similar to forums I used to post on. This site is almost completely anon with the exception the leadership having an email and it's your choice if that email matters or not as an identifier. \n\n\n I have noticed an uptick on Reddit lately though of people who think short account age and lack of history is sus. I delete and remake my reddit accounts constantly.\n\n\n The younger generation is terminally online to their detriment. They seem to place value in having an online identity that is tied to their real world counter which I personally will never understand.  \n\n\n This makes me an \"old\", which is why I have a public facing Facebook, because \"old people use Facebook\". If they can find a Facebook they will just say oh they are old rather than even bringing up that it's sus that I have a minimal online footprint.\n\n#### Comment ID lrbwisu with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-10-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1fy6ars/should_we_delete_our_classmates_com_accounts/lrbwisu/) (in reply to ID lqtzykd):\nI keep an alt reddit account that's less opinionated just incase they want a list of accounts\n\n#### Comment ID lrcehqa with +1 score by [(Lex_Orandi, Reddit, 2024-10-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1fy6ars/should_we_delete_our_classmates_com_accounts/lrcehqa/) (in reply to ID lqtzykd):\nMy sister in law discouraged my wife from going on a second date with me because I wasn’t anywhere to be found on social media.

You'd find your school and graduating year then join your classmates. Was a way to see what everyone has been up to since graduating, reunions, random stuff like that. When Facebook made Groups it pretty much killed Classmates, you could just make a group for your reunion or anything. \n\nI signed up under a made up name back in the day and never uploaded anything identifiable.

Everyone should freeze their account there (theworknumber\"dot\"com). I made a couple different posts on antiwork about it and they never got any traction. I tell everyone I know to freeze their accounts and few people take it seriously. The Work Number has so much information about your previous employment including salary, vacation and sick time taken, if you were enrolled in benefits or 401k, how much your deductions were, etc.\n\nImagine you are getting paid $80k at your current job and you apply for a job with an advertised salary of $95k. You try to be casual about it during the interview and say \"I'm looking for at least $95k. I make just a bit less than that at my current job, so with my experience and tenure I feel like $95k is fair compensation.\" They say \"Yep, sounds fair, that's right in line with our budget for this position.\" And then they pull your background check, including your job history through TWN, and find out you currently only make $80k, and lowball you at $84k.

You want just enough online prescence to show you're a real person, it's ok if that persona appears boring. My boss friend requested me on Facebook and ultimately used photos that were about 15 years old (college times) to embarrass me at a work dinner.

Jobs were one of the main reasons. I personally would not tie my name to anything if I can avoid it, and I set my privacy settings to as strict as I can. Like on Facebook, you can search my name or email all day, and you won't find me because it is not publicly available. I don't use my real name for Twitter, YouTube, or anything I can avoid. Really, just Facebook has my name, and unless I find you, you can't see my Facebook. And I don't even say or do things that I am worried about, I just like my privacy. \n\nYou never know what you say today that won't be okay tomorrow.

      "# Post ID f51fx2: Received an email from classmates.com about account registration using my real full name. But I didn't make the account and the password is something I've never used. with +15 score by [(fritocloud, Reddit, 2020-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/f51fx2/received_an_email_from_classmatescom_about/)\nClassmates.com... sounds familiar right? The kings of spam. They came out before Facebook and friendster but they went with the premium model and I had assumed they would have went out of business. I know they were sued at one point for deceptive advertising practices because they would email you saying that something was happening with your account but you had to pay to see what it was. And then when you paid, you would discover that nothing was happening with your account. Well, I just got an email from them welcoming me to the site. The thing is, I didn't make an account with them. I honestly can't remember if I ever made one with this email account (I know I signed up with them at some point but I'm pretty sure I was still using an AOL account at the time, lol. And that was many many years ago.) Anyways, I've gotten emails like this before where someone is using my email address with random info and I just assume it is some sort of scammer or spammer or bots or whatever. I usually go in and report or deactivate the account and no big deal. But this is the first time it has ever happened with my real first and last name. The other weird thing is they are using my full first name and for most things that I sign up for, I use a shortened version of my name. Which makes it less likely they got my name from one of those data leaked lists but not impossible. \n\nThere is a button to report the account for \"being made in error\" but that's the final twist to this. I really don't trust classmates.com and I really don't want to click that link in the email until I know what's going on. The way I see it, this could just be a diabolical plot on classmates.com's part, trying to get customers for their site or whatever.\n\nSo, I guess what I'm looking for is any advice on how to handle this. I should note that I do monitor my credit reports pretty thoroughly so I'm not too worried about any kind of identity theft issues with my SSN attached. Also, has anyone else had this happen to them? With this specific site or another site? Does anyone have any idea how this would happen? I very much doubt it is a real person who just coincidentally has my exact name and that they mistakenly put *my* email address (which is fairly unique and does not have my name in it at all) in when they were signing up.\n\n[Here is a screenshot with my info and the info from the fraudulent account omitted.](http://imgur.com/a/FwRkO4G)\n\nAlso, [here is some dogtax](http://imgur.com/gallery/TzWkUWO) (not mine found it on imgur while uploading my screenshot.

I go to a college that is about an hour from my home.  However, there were several people that went to a high school that was only 30 minutes from the college campus and only 40 minutes from my house.  The strangest thing about this is that one of those people is actually my cousin that I stopped talking to after I was 13 because her parents are not good people and never wanted a relationship with me, my siblings, or my other cousins (they are technically one of my aunts and uncles but don't call them as so).\n\nBut I'm glad I didn't go to college with anyone that I knew in high school.  I kinda had to start fresh and give myself opportunity to meet people that I totally enjoy more than some of my classmates from high school.  Not as petty or egotistic just because you mature and you get to be out of your comfort zone and if you don't like someone in college, you don't have to be around them as much, nor do you really see them as much (I grew up in a small town with the same people and bullshit).\n\nMy advice; don't go to the same college as someone just because they are your \"bestie\" and you have to be together nor should you room with them.  It creates differences and problems between you both and you might stop being friends, plus, you need to branch out and meet new people in your life.  The friends I made in college so far after my freshmen year are incredible people and it almost feels like I've known them for a long time.

If I really worked at it it I could make $300,000 in a year easy (would need me to work 7 12s in a place like LA or California though)\n\n## Comment ID lpghygs with +2 score by [(MooseBoys, Reddit, 2024-09-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/1frtchs/my_classmates_gpa/lpghygs/) (in reply to ID 1frtchs):\n*Thank you for your interest in DeVry University’s online degree program.

No one told me. I want to repeat, no one told me what a GPA was. Not friends, not counselors, not teachers. No one. And the whole time my parents were confidently telling me \"all you have to do is get your diploma\" and \"a D is passing, why do extra school work if half the effort gets you the same outcome.\"\n\nI eventually went to a school of choice where I literally only did 70% of my assignments questions because it was learning at your own pace (fully on a computer) and when you tripped over 70% correct the system would report the assignment as \"passed.\" I did that for 2 months and finished the second half of my junior year and all for my senior year to graduate early. I graduated with a 1.87 GPA and thought nothing of it.\n\nWhen I went to apply for colleges after the military the admissions offices just kept denying me until one day a really sweet lady from a state school called me and actually explained what a GPA was, that mine was never going to get me in, and how to augment it with community college. She literally saved me because everywhere else just gave me a form rejection.\n\nIt turned out okay. I went to a T14 school, then grad school, then law school, and now I'm doing great. But sometimes I still think about the fact that despite being able to \"pass\" 18 months of classes in 2 months, get near perfect grades in undergrad and grad school, and do fine in law school (things that mark me out as \"smart\" I suppose), most people would have written me off over a blind spot. I just didn't know what the purpose of that metric was, and didn't know it was important. \n\nIdk what this kid is going through, but there's an assumption in the general tenor of the post and responses that this kid is just messing up. They may just be misinformed. I never once got a grade lower than I wanted (except in algebra 2, blegh) but I also just *didn't know I was aiming too low for*.\n\n## Comment ID lphozqu with +1 score by [(bananabread5241, Reddit, 2024-09-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/1frtchs/my_classmates_gpa/lphozqu/) (in reply to ID 1frtchs):\nI mean community College is always an option if they're willing to\nMost universities will let you transfer in with community College transcripts and won't even look at your high school grades if you do it that way.

Unsolicited advice for your friend from someone who didn’t have this GPA, but a 3.7 was not good enough to get into a UC.

Transferred to the UC I never would’ve gotten into straight from high school, graduated cum laude, and now I’m in medical school. \n\nall this to say, even that GPA isn’t a death sentence if it’s from a lack of trying and not a genuine not understanding of anything.

Sophomore year, I was put in harder classes without doing the classes required to do them. So I was put i to algebra 2, calculus without even doing algebra 1 once. So that tanked my gpa.

      "# Post ID 8ciy5u: I love computer science. I hate my fellow computer science classmates. with +219 score by [(wtfthefuck, Reddit, 2018-04-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/)\nI need to get this off my chest, so please read my entire post instead of downvoting me based on my arrogant title. \n\nI am a computer science undergrad myself. I've always been fascinated with computers and the Internet ever since I was young. I simply cannot see myself working outside of this area - the incredible space for innovation and the power of exponential technologies is, to me, simply the most exciting thing I can think of. I constantly read about future technologies (shoutout to /r/Futurology) and find it disappointing that not many people share this admiration of mine, especially in this fantastic time period in which we live.\n\nI could spend hours talking about why I chose to study computer science, but I'll leave that for some other time. I need to talk about why I dislike my peers.\n\nI am definitely an introvert, but in my class of initially 50 people* I was probably the most outgoing. I haven't made many friends in college, which truly made me sad in the beginning because I could see myself making more (and better) friends if I were to study pretty much anything else. The only thing that me and 90% of my classmates have in common is that we, for different reasons, chose to study CS. Most of these people are your typical anime-loving gamers, which is of no interest to me. Most of them plan on focusing on game development, which is fine, but they simply don't have an open mind for other ideas an technologies. They play games and want to make games, as if that is even a realistic scenario. \n\nI don't even need to mention most of them are awkward as hell. This is no reason for me to dislike any of them, but it definitely makes it more difficult for me to bond with them. I have one good friend who shares common interests with me and doesn't act awkward at all. My other friends are nice people and (sometimes) good to hang out with, but they are definitely weird. I almost forgot to mention there is only one girl in my class, which really disappoints me, but I can't say I don't comprehend.\n\nI feel like we need more people in CS who are also interested in the arts and humanities, as I see this as an important trait for understanding the power of the technologies we deal with. As Steve Jobs said it, \"Edwin Land of Polaroid talked about the intersection of the humanities and science, I like that intersection. There’s something magical about that place.\"\n\nI think it is important to note that I am from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and this is based on my point of view, I don't want to generalize CS students. I guess in a more developed country more people would be interested and open to the possibility of studying CS, and therefore providing more diversity among students. And that is exactly what I would like to see.\n\nI hope I haven't offended any readers in any way with my personal thoughts. I'm just very passionate about technology and can't seem to get the same vibe from the people I deal with on a daily basis.\n\n*I would say 50% of the people who started college with me already quit. Every semester some people leave, and we only had 2 (TWO) people graduating in CS last semester. But CS is hard, nothing new here.\n\n\n## Comment ID dxfc6b7 with +113 score by [(valbaca, Reddit, 2018-04-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfc6b7/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\nYup. Sounds like CS Undergrad hasn't changed one bit (pun intended).\n\nI'm pretty antisocial but even I went outside the CS department to find friends because they were insufferable. Every guy thought they were Neo, or House M.D. or some other \"genius douche\" persona. Each with their own terrible concoction of technical arrogance that they try to cover up their own insecurities with.\n\nCollege should have no shortage of interesting groups you can join to meet.  Sports, politics, and diversity groups are usually the largest.\n\nPerhaps also look outside your immediate major; perhaps during electives and such. I did a dual EE / CS program and the contrast between (most) EE classmates and CS was astounding. EE students would work hard in groups, help each other, and would be happy to grab drinks or hangout afterward.\n\n### Comment ID dxfhhol with +15 score by [(hubbahubbawubba, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfhhol/) (in reply to ID dxfc6b7):\nI was in a similar program, and I think the contrast may have to do with when the programs break you, so to speak. In an EE program, you've already had to survive modern physics during or before the first semester of sophomore year. CS, by contrast, doesn't really break you until you take advanced algorithms (junior, or, for some people, even senior year). Having your own delusions of grandeur destroyed early helps foster the cooperative spirit you see in a lot of engineering programs.\n\n#### Comment ID dxfp8sd with +8 score by [(aogmana, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfp8sd/) (in reply to ID dxfhhol):\nI think this is a really good point.

I was a very social out-going person in highschool. Did the sports, drank the beer, etc. Firstly, you need to recognize that these people are a different breed. Secondly, you need to understand that you are a part of the problem (hear me out).\n\nI was always a computer guy though and loved playing games so I went in and you're right, the culture is very different. I was very jaded to not make friends quickly because everyone is so reserved. However, you need to understand that some people have a very hard time opening up and relating to people.\n\nFriendships are built off of social contracts. When going into a new environment with different types of people than what you are use to, you have to understand that you will not make friends if you do not share some interests. Anime is garbage, that's my opinion. Magic the Gathering is boring. Bassnectar is an overrated DJ. There are tons of things that I dislike however I will still support others and even venture down the rabbit hole to explore some of these topics to firstly, give company to potential friends and two, maybe see if I like it down the line. \n\nFriendship should be a two way street as well, so if you go to anime-con or whatever it is, try to get your new friend to do something that you like thats out of his/her comfort zone. People are reluctant to change, just like you. But breaking down barriers and trying things you don't like will either expose you to something that maybe down the line you enjoy, or expose other people to try other things that they might enjoy, and make friends while doing it.\n\nMy co-worker loves VR, soul-caliber, magic the gathering, and things I don't quite enjoy. However, I'll still go over and play some of these games because he likes to play them with people. Afterwards, I'll say lets hit the bar and he generally dragged his feet the first couple times but now he loves to go. And to be honest, play soul caliber has actually gotten a little fun, i must admit. My other group of friends love dubstep and going to Bassnectar shows. I dislike dubstep and Bassnectar and would rather see other artists, but I still have fun because I'm with people that are friends and we'll end up going to another show that I like sometime. Hell, I even got one of these hippy dudes to play some overwatch with me.\n\nAll in all, be more open to these people. Scratch that, be more open to all people. Lots of these guys are nerdy introverts, but are really cool when you get to know them.\n\nAs for the girls in CS, get used to it bud.\n\n### Comment ID dxh5qqk with +14 score by [(PetrichorBySulphur, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxh5qqk/) (in reply to ID dxfized):\nThanks for saying this.

I'm a mix of introvert and extrovert. I tend to be friendly, can hold a conversation well, and I'm interested in almost everything. To make matters worse, I'm a girl who is into fashion (I have a mean shoe collection), and other things generally not ascribed to CS people. I get along with everyone, but am not really close with most CS people because the similar interests just aren't there.\n\nI totally get your experience with CS kids not caring about anything but CS. For instance, one of our professors had us doing a multicultural day where we focused on programming tasks with a multicultural component. One kid decided to sit out because he 'didn't care about culture,' and took a 0 grade instead of participating. I frequently have to hear people sneer at any major that isn't STEM, and yet, when they have to engage in topics like politics, geography, or literature, the amount they don't know is simply astounding. I think it's just a cop out/ excuse when I hear them say those topics aren't challenging enough for them.\n\nI am lucky because I found a few people like me in CS who are pretty outgoing and socially balanced. I would say just try to make friends in your non-cs classes. It's okay if you just don't have the same interests as the CS kids. \n\nAlso didn't see you were from Brazil until I already wrote the above.

I’ve been in the software industry for over 20 years, and you are correct in that the people who rise to the top are artistically-inclined. As the lead architect of an enterprise dev team, my primary hobby is singing and that of my second-in-command (and longtime friend) is playing guitar. The most incredible software developers who I’ve ever worked with in my career were NOT the aspbergery-types you typically see in school and TV shows.

Management relies on the the devs who can communicate highly technical problems in a language without jargon and lingo so that they can make business decisions based on it. Larger dev teams rely on dev leads who have creativity and long-term vision to compose architectures for systems that will allow them to divide, conquer, and scale solutions for very large and complicated problem spaces. And sadly, the industry is actually sorely lacking many who can do both of those things well. Most devs in the industry right now are like most of your classmates: tightly clinging to the need to believe they are amazing at what they do because they need that to define their persona and value in society. As a result, they often never expand their knowledge beyond a single platform, language, or area of expertise, because outside of their niche, they would no longer be as good as they believe they are within their niche.\n\nOn the other hand, the relative few devs who are more creative and artistically-inclined spend their careers soaking up everything they can about every language and platform that sounds interesting to learn. Even if they never use that platform again in the future, they learn new ways of solving problems and new abstractions that apply to every platform and every language. The devs at my point in my career who have done this are nowadays typically the full-stack developers and, in fact, that's exactly what I do. I build servers in Java EE or Spring used by mobile client applications which I also build for Android and iOS. I learned all of those platforms and languages and many more on side projects long before I ever needed them in the workplace just because I love learning new things. Except for me and the other lead architect on the project, all other devs only work on one of our codebases because they never bothered to and don't want to learn any of the others. Being an \"Android Developer\" or an \"iOS Developer\" or a \"server-side developer\" is what defines them.\n\nSo that would be the best advice that I could offer to you. Don't settle for a niche like you'll see so many others do in your career. Never stop learning. Always be thirsty for more. If you can't think of a reason to learn something new that you're interested in, create a side project that opens the door on that reason. And don't let your career or your niche define who you are. As someone in the industry different from many other developers, you can much more easily become much bigger than just a niche. For me, when people ask what I do for a living, I tell them, \"I write software\", not that \"I am a software developer\". Because it's not who I am. It's just what I do. Who I am is much bigger than just my job.\n\n## Comment ID dxfi3qe with +2 score by [(puppypink, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfi3qe/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\nI'm about as extroverted as you can get, and I agree it can be tough making friends in com sci courses! I think part of it, however, comes from self-imposed beliefs - a lot of coworkers I know seem social and fairly outgoing when we hang out, but said they didn't have friends as undergrads, because they were engineers, so they just stayed in their dorms and played video games. \nI'm minoring in studio art, and the students in those classes are more sociable during class, but I still didn't see them often outside of class until I started inviting them to events we were both interested in - gallery receptions, campus activities, even a movie we both wanted to see. Every friend you have was once a stranger, and it took one of you to reach out - it might as well be you! If you don't want to or don't feel you know any individual well enough, see about organizing a small weekend event, like a game tournament or code jam, and invite your whole class(es)! That way, you can get to know each other over something you all like, but can get to know them in a more casual environment.\nAlso, your views of your classmates sounds rather conceited. If you haven't made friends with many of these people, how do you know they don't have the same interests as you? How do you know their reasons for going into computer science? It seems like you're quick to label them all as \"typical anime-loving gamers\" despite sounding like you don't know most of them too well. Stop assuming things about your peers and just talk to them. Maybe that person with the same passion for future technologies you have also likes gaming or anime, and is just another person you wrote off thinking you know better.\n\n## Comment ID dxfwi26 with +2 score by [(Varzoth, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfwi26/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\nNo doubt your college has a bunch of different clubs, try them out.

I looove coding up stuff, and I love looking at algorithms, and doing the math related to CS, but I also spend ample time looking at other sciences, and trying to apply what I learned there.\n\n## Comment ID dxh7ibf with +2 score by [(HelloHaiHey, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxh7ibf/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\nI’m sort of on the same boat but not quite?? I’m in my first year of college majoring in CS (obviously) but I cant really connect with people in my classes, specially since I’m one of two females in my current class. I think it’s mostly due to the fact that I decided I wanted to go into Computer Science in my last year of high school. \n\nMostly I’m pursuing computer science because I learned in my last year that I love coding. While I am getting introduced to the more technical aspect of things I know for a fact my major interest is programming languages and what I can do with them. I mean you can do so many amazing things with programming it amazes me. \n\nI honestly didnt really connect with some of my classmates until we were grouped together for a group project and then we got talking. But honestly I found my best friends to be people from outside my major. I was friendless until my second semester and I only became friends with people because I started getting involved with activities around the college. I also got a job at the college and managed to create a really strong bond with all the people I work with. It’s really amazing and we all have different majors so that’s even more reassuring. Maybe people in other tech related majors might share the same passion for technology you have!\n\n## Comment ID dxhxv7b with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-04-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxhxv7b/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\nI feel like you may be writing off some of your peers with getting to know them, although this may just be because my experience is different. \n\nAlso, please don't  complain about the gender ratio unless you're actively trying to change it.

There are no classes, abot 250 people start visiting the lectures every year at my university. So naturally there is way more diversity to the students. \nMost people here don't have plans what to do in the future and rather let themselves be inspired by the lectures. \nThere is about 30% girls though most of them plan on becoming teachers.\nI conaider CS extremely easy since i came from math and CS is just math in 10 times easier. I would say put of 250 about 100 get their bachelor. \nIf you want to have friends with hih interest in CS go to a university that is very good in the fiel, it will attract all the people who are very good and interested in CS.\nAnd about the awkward peolpe, I found that it is very easy to talk to them because you as an introvert can relate and become way more confident.\n\n## Comment ID dxfh724 with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfh724/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID dxfin0g with +9 score by [(wtfthefuck, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfin0g/) (in reply to ID dxfh724):\nThere is literally just one single sentence in this long post in which I address this issue with women in CS.

I’m studying Games Tech because it’s an interest and it’s supposedly quite a complex and difficult course, but I know that CS is what’s going to get me a job in the end ultimately.

Feels like basically every CS student fits the stereotype of spends all their time at home playing video games and watching anime with little to no interested in humanities, politics, philosophy, etc. It makes sense though why those kinds of people would gravitate towards CS. As someone who does have interests in philosophy and politics, I can't say that I'm really excelling in my STEM courses. I'm getting by but in humanities courses I actually excel. I primarily chose CS because I want to have the ability to make my dreams come to life and start my own business(es) and I think programming might be the best avenue to do that requiring the lowest amount of capital. I mean programming can basically allow you to make anything which is what it's attraction was to me. Humanities is something that although is interesting to me doesn't really translate into helping me start my own business. \n\nAnd stereo-typically enough the introverted gamer nerdy types are also the ones that seem to perform the best in my CS classes and the worst in their humanities classes.\n\n## Comment ID dxfsw6t with +1 score by [(memoriten, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfsw6t/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\nI understand what you are saying, I also don't really like my classmates because they live inside some kind of bubble.\n\n## Comment ID dxfvnbq with +1 score by [(JezzaPar, Reddit, 2018-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8ciy5u/i_love_computer_science_i_hate_my_fellow_computer/dxfvnbq/) (in reply to ID 8ciy5u):\nDamn I feel like I wrote this post myself.

I also  don't really understand why most people also think that it is strange that i take CS and often wonder why more people don't take it especially assuming that it is currently and will most likely remain as one of if not the most fruitful per-say  industries today with all of the future technological possibilities and also the fact that almost everyone in the worlds population has a computing device in the form of a mobile phone to a games console to a desktop pc. My theory as to why people don't take it is that they just don't understand it but then i just come off as a bit off a prick i guess.

I know you think that because you're a VP you know more than the rest of us, but look back over the last three years.  See all that failure and waste of money & time?  Those were all your GREAT ideas.  \r\n\r\n3. YOU CAN'T SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH ANOTHER ROUND OF LAYOFFS.

In fact, when October rolls around, most employees begin telling jokes about who'll get released.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the biggest concern for UOL is that there seems to be no vision.  The future of the company almost seems as if it is being decided by a blindfolded man throwing darts. The Communications segment of UOL is currently still shackled to the dial-up ISP business, and after flopping around trying other directions, has now decided to gamble on the mobile broadband sector - except that they are using tech that is already 5 years out-of-date and trying to market it to a demographic that's still confused by cell phones.",

      "# [My Gen Z daughter and her Altadena and Pasadena classmates are showing us the way by Najeeba Syeed on 2025-01-16](https://religionnews.com/2025/01/16/my-gen-z-daughter-and-her-altadena-classmates-are-showing-us-the-way/)\n(RNS) — This column is a love letter to the children of Pasadena and Altadena.\n\nI often write about religion and interfaith cooperation in disaster and conflict. This week, as I write this column in tears, my analysis hits home. My children are products of a public school system in which almost 7,000 students lived in the evacuation zone of the Eaton Canyon Fire, and 2,600 in the core burn zone of the same fire. My children spend half their life in Altadena. The neighborhood as of this moment is still closed off; my children still have a home, though the house next door burned down.\n\nWe often worshipped in Altadena and, especially in Ramadan, broke fast in Masjid Al-Taqwa, now only a pile of ash and rubble. In the past, for five years, I ran an organization that served northwest Pasadena and Altadena schools and communities. I lived in the Pasadena area for 15 years. Our connections to these communities are deep and beloved.\n\nMy daughter has been active on Instagram trying her best to raise money for the many friends she knows who have lost their homes. She is awe-inspiring to me. Immediately after hearing from her friends and schoolmates, these teenagers moved into action, sharing GoFundMe’s and other sources.\n\nThey have been out of school for two weeks and have spent every day volunteering at different sites, naturally folding into it without question. They are not interested in photo opportunities — in fact, many seem allergic to pictures of them doing service. Instead, I see them using their powerful tools of social media not to amplify their efforts but to highlight the donation needs of different communities. They are sharing stories that change the narrative of the fires from one that impacted only celebrities and high-income families. Their volunteerism is concentrated in the notion that service is an ethic of care, that compassion is a way of being. These collective efforts offering immediate support and hope for healing are hallmarks of their generation.\n\nAltadena and northwest Pasadena have historically been home to a diverse array of communities — from Black businesses, homes and historic institutions, to powerful Latino churches, to Armenian and other communities. We are all a part of the fabric of greater Pasadena and Altadena. A Jewish synagogue, a mosque and at least three area churches were lost in the fires.\n\nThese are communities rich not in wealth in comparison to some others, but in their celebration of diversity, a place that was open when racism and redlining kept groups from buying property elsewhere.\n\nIt should not be surprising that the children of this community would lead in taking care of their own across faiths, ethnicities and languages. And they are also children of the pandemic. Their eighth grade graduations were full of speeches that talked about the trauma of collective isolation. Even then, they sounded like individuals far beyond their years. They have grown up already in the face of global crises, and when it hit home, their huge hearts and ethical orientations responded to the moment without hesitation.\n\nA teen-led clothing drive in Pasadena at Bravo Salon, for instance, and the Altadena Teen Girls Fire Recovery were organized and fueled by teens. Other teens are serving at organizations they already had connections to, like the Flintridge Center, which is in the heart of the community. Faith-based and public schools, as well as churches and other religious sites, have become centers for teens to organize relief efforts. Many family-owned and local businesses have also been sites for teens to organize relief efforts and activities such as feeding first responders.\n\nI was part of an interfaith vigil organized online this week on Zoom because so many of the families had lost their homes. A Muslim, Jewish and Christian team of clergy and leaders prayed and offered words of wisdom for navigating what will be a long-term recovery for the communities impacted by this tragedy. I offered a caution on making sure theology and religion are not used to blame anyone or communities for the cause of this catastrophe — and instead to focus on our overlapping teachings of healing and hope.\n\nOur teens are doing that in the very practical sense. Their continued service and their steady moral compass make me excited to see the world they will run. A world in which we don’t need a litmus test on your beliefs before we offer care, where your story is important to share no matter which income bracket you come from. A world in which the measure of our humanity is how much we show up for each other with an embodied empathy that asks, “What do you need, dear friend, who I may not know? Let me be there for you.”\n\nThis vision of humanity in crisis contradicts the tropes of a self-centered generation that is concerned only with its own public personas and presentation. It is evidence of a group of young people who, when faced with the gravity of so much loss, chooses connection over isolation, action over apathy, generosity over a scarcity mindset. When one of us flourishes, we all flourish.\n\nIt would be a great way to go into 2025 with this imperative, one that many older generations and, dare I say, policymakers could benefit from in their own work.\n\n(Najeeba Syeed holds the El-Hibri Endowed Chair at Augsburg University in Minneapolis and is executive director of the Interfaith Institute there.

      "# [Ode to my male classmates by Ella Duggan, Madison McMahon on 2024-12-12](https://berkeleybeacon.com/ode-to-my-male-classmates/)\nIn writing workshops, I don’t expect perfection, but I do expect to be able to tolerate reading the majority of the stories. In the writing, literature, and publishing major at Emerson College, though, men do not make up the majority.\n\nIt is my third semester witnessing a man fail to repress a smirk as he proudly raises his hand and taps his foot while he waits to present his story. When, to his relief, he is finally called on, he reads out a section that causes me physical pain. And it’s not just from the volume of his voice, obviously—you would think intentionally—decibels louder than any other voice in the room. Nope, the story is just bad.\n\nWhat makes a story “bad” can be subjective. More often than not, though, my male classmates turned in work that was the antithesis of everything the professor taught. These stories ranged from being clones of popular novels, to having little to no understanding of pacing, and featuring characters with as much dimension as the piece of paper wasted to print the story. Criticisms of their pieces are spoken to them so sickeningly sweetly that they might as well be compliments.\n\nThe women, though, they get full frontal honesty. This would be acceptable in a void, but in comparison to the praise of their floundering male counterparts, it ups the stakes to never, ever fail. After all, if their worst is praised and your best is shredded, what else can you do but be perfect?\n\nYou may be thinking I am the bad writer here as this is supposed to be an ode, a type of writing defined by its praise and adoration of the subject. But whether I’m the bad writer or the select men in my classes are is not the focus of this ode. It’s their confidence.\n\nWeek after week I watch men stroll into classes, proudly proclaiming they finished the assignment the night before and waiting to be showered in compliments. And they get them. They’ve set the bar so low, with a late night cram or an annoyingly loud voice, that when there is a fraction of something good, everyone scrambles to fawn over it. As for their idiocy, it is treated like a cute quirk.\n\nWhy can’t I be stupid?\n\nWomen are not granted the same leniency. We do not have the space to fail. Failing immediately aligns us with the stereotype of being subpar at everything except domestic tasks. We are no longer thought of when an opportunity arises and word of mouth in regards to our capability perpetuates this unhirable status. So, we gruel over pressurizing our coal—our work—until it becomes a diamond, or it breaks.\n\nThe problem with this is that failing is how anyone learns. Women stalling their progress by only accepting perfection, terrified to risk trying something new out of fear of failure, stifles the same creativity that men get to throw at the wall like toddlers with spaghetti.\n\nI want that same freedom. I want to be able to write a bad piece without watching my classmates whisper to one another that I have defined myself, forever, as a bad writer. I want to present a bad piece and be treated like I have potential. Like there is room for growth. Like my effort, my risk—if not the composition of the story itself—is respected. Just like the men in my class.\n\nThis is not just a problem for the writing, literature, and publishing major. In Emerson College as a whole, women literally take up more space by being 68% of the school’s population. Yet, that is not reflected in the microcosms of the classrooms where the men constantly interrupt women and female-presenting people.\n\nI have talked to friends in different majors—VMA, comedic arts, and journalism—and while their interactions are structured differently with filming on sets, improving scenes, or co-writing articles, the one throughline is a lack of shame on the men’s part.\n\nIn a film class, one man presented a highly-sexualized short film of a young woman’s mental unraveling. One man in comedic arts argued with a woman about the viability of a sexist comedy special he had not seen that the woman had. One man in journalism even claimed the all-female staff of an organization was sexist for not hiring him.\n\nJust a note: men can not experience sexism because sexism is a systemic issue based on the social, political, and economic power that men have held for centuries. It would take 500 consistent years of male oppression for it to be correct to use the definition of “sexist” in regards to a woman.\n\nWhile men on campus feel emboldened enough to be outwardly sexist, or just plain rude, women struggle to get by if a comma is out of place. It makes me sad to think of all the things women could have accomplished if they were nurtured to be just as confident as men.\n\nI am not arguing for the silence of all men all the time. If the men reading this could reflect on anything familiar in this piece, and I mean really, honestly reflect—because remember, your intention behind an action does not equal its impact—and stop doing said thing, that would be quite helpful.\n\nHowever, I anticipate there will be many men who feel this does not apply to them and go about their day, mucking up every other woman’s. I have no control over them. I have control over me. Which is why I am going to start failing. Loudly.\n\nBy failing, I mean I am going to raise my hand to answer a question even if I am not positive I have the correct answer. I am going to let myself stutter when I speak, and say lots of “ums.” I am going to switch points of view in the middle of a fiction piece because I have always wanted to try that. I am not going to sugar-coat my feedback out of fear a man will yell at me over it. Because yes, that did happen.\n\nThrough all that mess is curiosity, intelligence, and creativity trying to formulate themselves.\n\nIt is not my, nor any woman’s, responsibility to fix the problem men created, but I can flop and flail my way out of their trap until my spaghetti art on the wall turns into a Van Gogh.\n\nSo to my male classmates, thank you for setting this example. Be prepared to watch me fail louder.",
      "# [From Classmates to Soulmates: Sharing Goizueta Love Stories by Mary Flegler on 2025-02-11](https://www.emorybusiness.com/2025/02/11/from-classmates-to-soulmates-sharing-goizueta-love-stories/)\nLove has a way of finding people in unexpected places—occasionally, even in the midst of case studies and career aspirations. This Valentine’s Day, we’re sharing the journeys of a few couples whose love stories have their beginnings within our Goizueta community. From meet-cutes on campus to deepening bonds during international study trips, these Goizueta lovebirds remind us of the power of shared experiences to bring people together in profound ways.\n\nDanielle Donnelly 17EMBA and Ivan Aquino 17EMBA\n\nAs answered by Ivan Aquino\n\nHow did the two of you meet? Was it love at first sight or a gradual connection?\n\nShe definitely caught my eye from day one, but our relationship developed more naturally over time. As the program went on, we found ourselves spending more time together in group settings outside of school. Despite coming from very different backgrounds, we quickly realized that we shared similar goals and values, which brought us even closer.\n\nDo you remember your first conversation or interaction? What stood out to you about that moment?\n\nI sure do—it’s actually pretty funny. On the first day of class, a group of us was walking around campus when we came across a King of Pops stand. I was the only one who had cash, so I bought her a popsicle. It was a small gesture, but looking back, it feels like the first little moment that connected us.\n\nWas there a specific class, event, or project at Goizueta that brought you closer together?\n\nI wouldn’t say it was a single class or project that brought us together. It was more about the overall journey of the program. But if I had to pick a defining moment, the international trip to South Africa was definitely it—that experience truly brought us even closer.\n\nDid either of you make the first move? If so, how did it happen?\n\nShe says I did, but I’d say it was mutual. After spending time together in group settings, I eventually asked her out to dinner. I made the move because I couldn’t help but notice her looking at me a lot in class and at events—so in a way, we both did.\n\nHow did your time at Goizueta influence your relationship?\n\nIn addition to meeting the love of my life, we built incredible friendships that will stand the test of time. Goizueta also provided a strong network that has opened doors and shaped our career goals and ambitions in ways we couldn’t have imagined.\n\nHow did you balance academics, career aspirations, and your budding relationship while at Goizueta?\n\nHonestly, it wasn’t always easy, but I think that’s what made our relationship stronger. The program was intense, and we were both juggling academics, career goals, and everything else life was throwing at us. But instead of pulling us apart, it brought us closer—we leaned on each other, whether it was late-night study sessions, tough career decisions, or just venting about the day. Looking back, I think going through all of that together made us an even better team.\n\nHow has your relationship evolved since your time at Goizueta? Tell me more about where the two of you are now!\n\nWell, for starters, we’re married now! Since our time at Goizueta, we’ve just kept growing together. We’ve built a life together, supporting each other through career moves, personal milestones, and everything in between. We have a beautiful dog and are raising an 11-year old. We’ve really learned how to support each other in ways that only get deeper with time.\n\nDo you have a favorite memory as a Goizueta couple, whether on campus or beyond?\n\nThe international trip to South Africa will always stand out. It wasn’t just the adventure of being in a new place, but the way we experienced everything together—learning from each other, immersing ourselves in new cultures, and seeing the world through different lenses. It really deepened our connection and gave us a whole new perspective on life, both personally and professionally.\n\nWho was the better student?\n\nI had the better grades, but honestly, she’s always been the harder worker. She’s the type who puts in the effort no matter what, and that kind of dedication makes her the better student, hands down.\n\nRicardo Accioly 14MBA and Mariana Accioly 14MBA\n\nHow did the two of you meet? Was it love at first sight or a gradual connection?\n\nWe were aware of each other for at least 10 years before we were formally introduced. A mutual friend from our hometown requested that we connect to plan her visit to São Paulo/Brazil, as we both lived there. While discussing this friend’s visit and discovering the many acquaintances we shared, we realized how much we had in common. This conversation lasted five hours, leading to a scheduled date for the next evening. For Ricardo, it was an instant attraction. For Mariana, it was a bit more gradual.\n\nDo you remember your first conversation or interaction? What stood out to you about that moment?\n\nThe biggest revelation from our first conversation was how much we already knew about each other even before we officially met. Ricardo’s best friend dated Mariana’s sister, and we both ran competing digital agencies in Fortaleza. We frequently crossed paths in potential client’s hallways without knowing it at the time.\n\nWas there a specific class, event, or project at Goizueta that brought you closer together?\n\nThe MBA program brought us together. Before we met, Ricardo already had plans to get his MBA abroad and was studying for the GMAT. We realized that if Mariana was not on board with the plan, the relationship was not going to progress, and we would eventually go in different directions (Ricardo moving to the United States and Mariana staying in Brazil). Ricardo took Mariana to a few school presentations in Sao Paulo (Goizueta was one of them) and got her excited about the possibility of getting married and doing an MBA. He postponed his application by a year so they could study for the GMAT and apply together. Emory was Ricardo’s top choice, having lived in Atlanta as an exchange student, and his acceptance made the decision easy. Mariana joined the full-time one-year program in 2013, allowing them to graduate together in 2014.\n\nHow did your time at Goizueta influence your relationship?\n\nOur time at Goizueta helped us understand each other’s work preferences, significantly contributing to our current success. We learned about each other’s weaknesses and strengths and realized that we complement each other very well. We learned how to best work together and now we are business partners at SEI, a management and IT consulting company. Although we may have many differences and sometime even disagreements when it comes to our approach to business, we are each other’s biggest cheerleaders and supporters.\n\nHow has your relationship evolved since your time at Goizueta? Where the two of you are now?\n\nTime flies! Since Emory, we’ve both changed jobs. Ricardo left Deloitte for SEI in Jan 2020, and Mariana joined SEI from Cognizant in July 2021. We have two sons: Nicolas (7) born in Sept 2017, and Thomas (5) born in April 2019. We have also became American citizens in 2024, which solidified the decision we made back in 2012 when we decided to move to the United States to pursue our MBAs and make this country our home.\n\nDo you have a favorite memory as a Goizueta couple, whether on campus or beyond?\n\nWe hosted several parties and study groups in our tiny apartment at Post Briarcliff while in business school. We were together during KEGs, Mid-Semester Module trip to India, graduation and so many other events. It is great to share so many great memories.\n\nWho was the better student?\n\nMariana!\n\nWho is more likely to show off their Goizueta pride?\n\nRicardo. He still does with the Goizueta sticker at the back of the car.\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing about being a Goizueta couple?\n\nConstant support and being in it together were crucial. Sometimes, we had to study apart and needed to accept this separation. However, we also helped each other with topics, case studies, interview preparations and the uncertainties of the job search. This mutual support made going through the Goizueta MBA program as a couple much easier.\n\nDaniela D. Dimitrova 22EMBA and Stephen (Steve) Kennedy 23EMBA\n\nAs answered by Daniela Dimitrova\n\nHow did the two of you meet?\n\nWe met at Goizueta Business School on the first-class weekend. My team was assigned to greet Steve’s team during the lunch break. It was a gradual connection over the fall semester of 2021.\n\nDo you remember your first conversation or interaction? What stood out to you about that moment?\n\nMy first meaningful conversation with Steve happened while walking on the Beltline after my cohort’s usual gathering at Lady Bird. I had invited some of his cohort members to join us, and he happened to come along with a few of his classmates. What stood out to me most was how effortlessly we connected—our conversation flowed naturally, and I was amazed at how well he understood me from the very start.\n\nHow did your time at Goizueta influence your relationship?\n\nFrom the start, Steve and I shared a common academic goal, which strengthened our bond. We built friendships across each other’s cohorts, forming connections that wouldn’t have been possible otherwise due to our different backgrounds and communities. Our time at Goizueta also gave us a mutual understanding of the challenges of balancing work and academics, further deepening our support for one another.\n\nAre there any specific places on campus that hold special meaning for your relationship?\n\nLullwater Preserve and Patterson Green, along with the broader Emory neighborhood, hold special significance for us. Living between the Clairmont and Clifton campuses, we take daily walks through the area, making it a meaningful part of our routine. Patterson Green, in particular, is especially significant—it’s where we shared many events, got engaged, and where our journey together truly began.\n\nHow has your relationship evolved since your time at Goizueta? Tell me more about where the two of you are now!\n\nWe got engaged on April 27th, 2024 in front of Goizueta on Patterson Green. The wedding is later this fall at the Miller-Ward House.\n\nDo you have a favorite memory as a Goizueta couple, whether on campus or beyond?\n\nOne of our favorite memories is our global immersion trip to Barcelona and Lisbon. Our two cohorts switched locations mid-air, and after the trip ended, Steve flew back to Barcelona. We extended our stay, spending extra days exploring the city, visiting Gaudí exhibits, and touring the Sagrada Familia with my stepsister who flew in from Bulgaria. This was our first trip/vacation together and the first time Steve met anyone from my family.\n\nWho is more likely to show off their Goizueta pride?\n\nWithout a doubt, it’s Steve!

Edna Milanga ’21, MBA ’23, and her daughter attended Illinois State at the same time.\n\nAppears In Illinois State: Spring 2024\n\nOriginally from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Milanga started her academic journey at Heartland Community College, earning an associate degree and making her way through English as a second language classes before transferring to Illinois State to earn a bachelor’s degree in international business. Milanga later enrolled in Illinois State’s MBA program. Kazigwa wasn’t far behind, transferring to Illinois State for its computer networking and telecommunications program.\n\nTheir mother-daughter bond only grew when they became Illinois State classmates. Milanga and Kazigwa made time for each other during the week, meeting for meals and running errands together.\n\n“She was (on campus) early in the morning, and I would be there in the afternoon,” said Milanga. “Sometimes we would go for lunch in Watterson and have a good time. We went to the bookstore to order textbooks, and we went to a job fair together.”\n\nThey also used their experiences to help each other. Milanga guided her daughter through class scheduling. Kazigwa offered technology expertise in return.\n\n“We do homework together,” said Milanga. “She’s good with the computer, so when I’m stuck and frustrated, she helps me troubleshoot.”\n\nMilanga and Kazigwa said their unique experience brought them closer together.\n\n“We became closer friends. We shop together, do our nails together, watch shows together,” said Milanga. “She’s my BFF.”\n\nKazigwa walked across the same commencement stage as her mother last December.\n\nThis time, Milanga did the cheering.",
      "# [I’m Asian, But My Child Looks White. I Wasn’t Prepared For What Her Classmates Said To Her. by Miun Gleeson on 2025-02-26](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/asian-white-biracial-child-race-school_n_67b42912e4b011f6d4d8061c)\nAs an Asian parent, you never forget your child’s first… race-related incident.\n\nI’ve been training for this my whole life. I knew the day would come when the world would have something to say about my biracial child: curiosity at best, criticism at worst.\n\nBut I primed and prepped ahead of time. Shaped and changed by my personal experience of being teased and ridiculed for being Asian, I have always felt uniquely qualified to address similar challenges for my half-Asian child.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the first real incident didn’t unfold the way I thought it would.\n\nMy daughter’s fourth-grade class made a startling discovery about her this week: She is, in fact, Asian. Met with complete surprise by many, this “bombshell” unfolded in a way befitting many elementary school experiences: in humiliating, hurtful fashion.\n\nMy daughter’s class recently learned about Lunar New Year. While chatting with a friend, she made a passing reference to her Asian ethnicity. This breaking news quickly spread and was met with a collective gasp among her classmates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Wait, you’re ASIAN?!”\n\n“You don’t even look like it!”\n\n“Hey, guys, look who says she’s Asian!”\n\nUpon hearing about this incident after school, my reaction to her was equally incredulous:\n\n“Wait, they thought you were WHITE?”\n\nMy child is, indeed, half Asian and half white. She is a product of my full Korean-ness and her white father, whom she has always more closely resembled. She has my husband’s fair complexion, light brown hair, and enviably long eyelashes that frame her big, beautiful eyes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, the fact that her classmates had pegged her as white this whole time was news to me. As her mother, I have always seen my child as white and Asian. As for my daughter? She is understandably confused and upset that her classmates are now seeing her differently when her racial identity was never considered or remarked upon until now.\n\n“I overlooked that being half of something can be even harder to navigate. As a parent, I was so busy worrying about discrimination that I never anticipated disbelief.”\n\nAt this point in her barely decade-long life, my daughter’s ethnicity is just one aspect of her identity — nothing more, nothing less. Like many kids, she is more inclined to share other notable self-identifiers that capture who she is: an avid soccer player, a joyful singer who does her best work in the car, and a diehard donughnut enthusiast whose most objectionable quality among her peers might be that she hates ice cream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, again, I have been preparing for this since before she was born. I informally crafted a playbook to help counter all the greatest hits that would invariably come her way, including the classic standby: “What are you?” From an early age, I’ve led her toward a generous buffet of possible answers: American, Caucasian, Irish, White, Korean, Asian, Asian American. Mixed-race, blended-race, biracial, half this/half that. Take your pick, they all work. If simple facts don’t work to counter ignorance and insults about how you look, I advised, throw in some witty comebacks or withering looks. I’ve got lots of stuff in this starter pack.\n\nFor all my concern, however, there was always a hopeful asterisk in the plan — maybe my half-Asian kid would have it a bit easier than I did. Her “otherness” only comprised half of her identity, I reasoned. So perhaps her experience could be slightly mitigated by the fact that her name is easy to pronounce, and she doesn’t have the almond-shaped eyes that are so frequently seen as an invitation for insults against Asians.\n\nBut what happened in my daughter’s class showed me how wrong I was. I overlooked that being half of something can be even harder to navigate. As a parent, I was so busy worrying about discrimination that I never anticipated disbelief. Because, for multiracial people, there tends to be a follow-up; the ultimate insult added to the injury of the already-problematic question of “What are you?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProve it.\n\nAfter her classmates learned she is Asian, my daughter shared that some of them scrunched up their faces and gave her “weird looks.” What followed was an uncomfortable rapid-fire volley of pointed questions: If you’re Asian, do you celebrate Lunar New Year, too? Have you ever had kimchi? What do you MEAN you don’t like kimchi? Say something in Korean. Why don’t you speak Korean? But you just said you were Korean.\n\nI wish I could tell her that kids are just being kids, but deep down, I know this is merely a warm-up to a more intense cultural crucible that will continue throughout her life.\n\nThe one-two punch of assuming she was white and then expecting her to prove her Asian ethnicity is something I never dealt with. As a full Korean, my experience with racism was brutal but uncomplicated — the sing-song, ching-chong insult achieved its one-note cruelty every time. My otherness was never called into question because my unmistakably Asian face and “funny-sounding” name were all the credentials I needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy defensive playbook relied on the premise that she would be scrutinized or singled out for being Asian. It didn’t account for the possibility that the rest of the world wouldn’t see her as Asian — making her experience different from my own, and in some ways, more difficult. My one-size-fits-all, defensive posture failed to acknowledge the nuance and extra care needed in her specific situation.\n\nWe Don't Work For Billionaires.

I’ll readjust, support and learn along the way. And my parenting will always be underwritten by what remains unchanged in how I see her, and how I hope she’ll see herself: as not half of anything, but fully whole, derived from being the best of both her father and I, of both races and cultures.",
      "# [From classmates to soulmates: Couple gets engaged at exact coordinates where they met in Polk State Nursing Program on 2025-02-14](https://www.polk.edu/news/from-classmates-to-soulmates-couple-gets-engaged-at-exact-coordinates-where-they-met-in-polk-state-nursing-program/)\n28.0336° N, 81.7138° W is more than just a set of coordinates—it’s the place where two Polk State College students found each other amidst the hustle of nursing school. The spot nestled on the Winter Haven Campus holds a deeply sentimental meaning for Natalie Tala and Zack Baksh.\n\nIn 2018, among the pressure of exams and the challenge of mastering medical skills, Tala and Baksh first crossed paths in the Polk State Nursing Program. What started as a shared academic journey soon blossomed into a love story, built on long hours of studying and getting to know each other. When the time came for Baksh to take the next step in their story, he knew exactly where he wanted to propose—the very spot where it all began at 28.0336° N, 81.7138° W.\n\nOn November 10, 2024, surrounded by the memories of their late-night study sessions and shared dreams, Baksh got on one knee and asked Tala to marry him. With Tala’s exuberant “yes,” their love story came full circle—proof that sometimes, the most extraordinary journeys start in the most unexpected places.\n\nFull-circle moment\n\n“It couldn’t have been a better location or a better moment,” Tala exclaimed. “This spot means so much to us. For our first anniversary, Zack gave me a bracelet with these coordinates. Getting engaged at the spot where we first met and spent countless hours just talking and spending time together throughout nursing school was really a full-circle moment.”\n\nBaksh first came to Polk State College as a student in its collegiate high school program. Inspired by members of his family who work in healthcare, he decided to pursue a career in nursing and called it a no-brainer to continue his education at Polk State.\n\n“It’s the local, affordable option,” he said. “But the Nursing Program is known for being rigorous and producing the best nurses. That’s the program I wanted to be in.”\n\nTala was also drawn to the program’s success, affordability, and proximity to home. Baksh recalls seeing Tala for the first time in their first semester.\n\n“I asked my friends who the cute girl in the pink scrubs was,” he laughed. “Then, we crossed paths in the parking lot.”\n\nThe parking lot where they would pledge to marry one another six years later.\n\nGrowing together\n\nThat same semester, Baksh was in a car crash that set him back in the program. He had to repeat the first semester, while Tala moved forward.\n\nHowever, this presented an opportunity for Tala to help Baksh with his studies, strengthening their immediate bond.\n\n“She was a big part of my support system,” Baksh reflected. “She was able to give me a heads up on what was to come in the program; what I needed to be studying and looking out for. She was able to guide me, and I was really grateful for that.”\n\nAt times, Baksh wasn’t sure if he would make it through. But Tala was there to support and motivate him, and he provided the same in return.\n\n“The Nursing Program is rigorous. Sometimes I thought, ‘Will I make it out?’” he added. “But Nat was there for me and helped me through.”\n\nPolk State’s Nursing Program boasted 100% licensure pass rates for the last three quarters of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.\n\n“We’re growing together, personally and professionally. It’s a special experience.”\n\n“You can tell when you are in the hospital, that those who are trained at Polk State stand out from the rest,” he said. “I am proud to say I’ve come from Polk State and I’m also proud of Nat and the incredible nurse that she has become.”\n\nTala received her Associate in Science in Nursing in 2020 and Baksh achieved his degree in 2021. They are both pursuing their Polk State Bachelor of Science in Nursing degrees while they serve as nurses for Lakeland Regional Health. They are on track to graduate in May.\n\nBaksh described Tala: “She’s meticulous. Her charting is top-tier. Her bedside manner is exceptional. Seeing the way that she treats patients and people inspires me to be a better nurse.”\n\nTala, in turn, described Baksh: “He’s strong, confident, and caring. He is very calm in his approach to nursing and always has the best interest of the patient at heart.”\n\nBaksh works on the cardiology floor while Tala serves in the intensive care unit. They will both transfer to Lakeland Regional Health’s new freestanding emergency department set to open this year in South Lakeland.\n\n“It’s exciting because we get to be part of the foundation of this brand-new building,” Tala said. “We’ll be the first team at this Lakeland Regional location and we’re really proud of that.”\n\n“We’re growing together,” Baksh added, “personally and professionally. It’s a special experience.”\n\nSchool, work & wedding planning\n\nTala will work the day shift, while Baksh will work nights. Luckily, they’re no strangers to balancing demanding schedules, always setting time aside to spend together, no matter how busy life gets.\n\n“Polk State helped me with my time management, expectations, and the importance of planning and preparation,” Tala explained. “We have a strong foundation.”\n\nTheir commitment to each other and their profession comes through in every aspect of their lives. Between caring for patients, finishing their bachelor’s degrees, and planning a wedding, the couple has learned to prioritize what matters most.\n\nWhen asked about juggling school, work, and wedding planning, Tala laughed it off with the confidence of a seasoned professional.\n\n“I’m not stressed about it, I’m the happiest I’ve ever been,” she said. Her calm demeanor reflects the lessons she’s learned throughout her nursing education—lessons that are deeply rooted in the foundation laid by Polk State.\n\nFor Baksh, his perspective on time management is influenced by his career choice as much as his relationship.\n\n“One thing that attracted me to the nursing profession was the schedule,” he explained. “I like that I can work three 12-hour days, then have four days off. It gives me a lot of time for family.”\n\nHe’s already envisioning a future where both his professional and personal lives flourish, and he’s grateful for the flexibility nursing offers to help him achieve that.\n\nAs they prepare to graduate with their bachelor’s degrees and embark on the next chapter of their lives, their shared journey at Polk State College has given them the tools they need to succeed in both their professional and personal lives. The same College that brought them together has prepared them to serve as exceptional nurses, ready to contribute to the local workforce and make a lasting impact on the lives of those they care for.",

Officials said they believe Crooks acted alone. But so far, they have not been able to uncover a motivation that drove the young man to unleash a hail of bullets at Trump, wounding the former president and killing a former fire chief who was shielding his daughters.\n\nThe FBI said it would continue to investigate the attack as an attempted assassination and an act of domestic terrorism.\n\n“The information that we have indicates that the shooter acted alone,” said Kevin Rojek, supervisory special agent in charge of the FBI’s Pittsburgh field office. “At present, we have not identified an ideology associated with the subject, but I want to remind everyone that we’re still very early in this investigation.”\n\nThe FBI said Crook had not been on their radar. Since his identification, a fragmentary portrait has emerged, almost by virtue of its omissions. He was employed as a dietary aide at Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center. The nursing home’s administrator Marcie Grimm said Crooks “performed his job without concern and his background check was clean”.\n\nNor have there been significant clues found in his political affiliations. He had registered Republican but had also donated $15 to the liberal ActBlue political action committee on Joe Biden’s inauguration day. He had no past criminal cases against him, according to public court records.\n\nClaire, a young woman who had known Crooks through his elder sister and who did not provide a last name, said she could not quite believe the boy she had once known had attempted to assassinate a US president.\n\n“He’s so young to want to go do that,” she said.\n\nShe said Crooks had had a difficult time socially. “He wasn’t the most attractive-looking and I don’t think he did sports that can add appeal,’” she said.\n\nFormer classmates who spoke to other news outlets filled in other memories. Some described Crooks as smart and shy. Others spoke of a long history of being bullied. An unnamed former classmate told the New York Post that Crooks was “a loner”. He said: “He probably had a friend group, but not many friends.”\n\nJameson Myers said that Crooks had tried out for the school rifle team but had not made the roster. “He didn’t just not make the team, he was asked not to come back because how bad of a shot he was, it was considered, like, dangerous,” Myers told ABC News. Jameson Murphy told the Post that Crooks was “a comically bad shot”.\n\nMax R Smith said to the Philadelphia Inquirer that Crooks “definitely was conservative”. “It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate,” Smith said.\n\nWith a nation on edge, establishing Crook’s motives is seen as a key to unlocking larger issues of deep political discord.\n\n“We’re looking into his background, his day-to-day activities, any writings and social media posts that might help us identify what led to this shooting,”, the FBI’s Rojek said. “We have not seen anything threatening at this time”.",

      "# [Pitt taught me to stand up against injustice, then sent police to beat my classmates - The Pitt News by opinionsdesk, Livia Daggett on 2024-06-07](https://pittnews.com/article/188699/opinions/opinion-pitt-taught-me-to-stand-up-against-injustice-then-sent-police-to-beat-my-classmates/)\nHere is a list of things I’ve learned in my three years at Pitt.\n\n1. During my first-year orientation, I was told the Pitt Police and University officials are here to protect and support me. I was told to add the police phone number to my contacts.\n\n2. In the first-year course “Anti-Black Racism: History, Ideology, and Resistance,” I was told via the Canvas site that “Various institutions, including universities, have sought to address anti-Black racism and inequities within their own organizations. The University of Pittsburgh has chosen to use this course to bring awareness and develop knowledge around anti-Black racism for its students.” I was offered further reading on how to be anti-racist, about the history of colonialism and about how, as Keisha N. Blain writes in one of the articles linked in the course, “The Fight Against Racism Has Always Been Global.”\n\n3. I learned in introductory and intermediate nonfiction that every choice made when reporting a story matters. Words matter, context matters, what we choose to cover and not cover matters.\n\nChancellor Joan Gabel’s June 5 email characterized what appeared to be plywood as having, vividly, “what appeared to be the intent to ignite.” This is lovely prose that I encourage her to bookmark for a novel about a secret plot to overthrow a government. Speculation does not belong in an email from a university administrator to concerned affiliates — most of whom, at the time, had no other information about the situation.\n\nThe email stated that antisemitic graffiti was sprayed on the Frick Fine Arts building. The only photo that I saw circulating online shows graffiti that reads “Free Gaza,” and some students report that other graffiti read “Cops beat students” — as indeed they did — and “F— Israel.” While some find the last disturbing, calling it antisemitic falls into the weary trap of conflating criticism of the state of Israel with antisemitism. Doing so worsens, rather than addresses, antisemitism. It also obscures the presumed point of the graffiti if it was indeed sprayed by someone protesting a state committing incredible violence against civilians.\n\nWhen asked to comment, a University spokesperson said, “For some, the graffiti sprayed on the Frick Fine Arts building might not meet the definition of antisemitism. For others, the graffiti was in proximity to other vandalism that included a weapon thrown through a building window, as well as concurrent demands for the cessation of Jewish student organizations and calls to end certain international definitions of antisemitism, which all created a context and the resulting description.”\n\nGabel is not a journalist, but her words arrive in every Pitt associate’s inbox, and she has an ethical responsibility to provide accurate and complete updates on happenings at the University.\n\n4. I learned from a lawyer in “Constitution and Civil Liberties” that students’ rights to free expression do not disappear when they step into class. Public universities, in particular, are taken to be forums of intense exchange and debate. Suppression of political speech receives the highest level of scrutiny at the legal level. But free speech is not just a legal protection — it’s a cultural value that we must protect.\n\nSome of the most iconic nonviolent protests in history involved disrupting private property — lunch counters, the site of the Boston Tea Party, and yes, university halls. Defending free speech is not just for pleasant, scheduled, quiet picket protests on sidewalks. Attempts to characterize it this way, from the right and left alike, are dangerous. Almost all the protests we’ve seen at Pitt and around the country — of students attempting to engage in peaceful, earnest political protest on their own campuses — are in the exact spirit of free expression, yet they’re being characterized as inherently violent, antisemitic, dangerous and full of external interlopers. This portrayal then gets used to justify brutal violence.\n\nThe chancellor’s email closed by rather hollowly reiterating the University’s “commitment to free expression and critical inquiry.” It claimed that the protests “are attempts to destroy property at the historical core of our campus, as well as accompanying action that in no way elevates open inquiry or allows for peaceful advocacy.” Yet the University has shown perfunctory interest in open inquiry, demonstrated by its refusal to engage with the intent to seriously consider divestment and its deafening silence on the suffering of Palestine, even when it immediately condemned the events of Oct. 7. Seeing through the attempt to portray these political protests as a wanton desire to destroy property is comically easy.\n\nWhen asked to comment, a University spokesperson said, “We are committed to free speech and civil discourse and how all this makes our students feel. We routinely meet with students on a variety of topics and issues including a recent discussion regarding the University’s investments. We do so within appropriate time, place and manner policies that exist to keep our community safe. Any suggestion that members of this administration have refused to meet and engage with students is completely false.”\n\n5. From my “Rights and Human Rights” course, PHIL 1400, I learned that during the genocide in Rwanda, the U.S. and other nations consistently refused to use the “g-word” because it would oblige them to act under the genocide convention.\n\nI learned that the US and other nations, to quote from a handout by my professor summarizing the 2002 Pulitzer-winning book “’A Problem from Hell’: America and the Age of Genocide” by Harvard professor Samantha Power, “tend to downplay the violence and claim that first-hand reports are exaggerated due to trauma. It is now clear from repeated cases that sustained first-hand claims of genocide are reliable and accurate.” History has shown that the genocide convention is usually invoked only after genocide occurs, at which point the perpetrators are “held accountable” and the world congratulates itself on its morality.\n\nI learned that the definition of genocide includes the murder with intent to destroy in whole or in part of a group and that Raphael Lemkin, a Polish Jewish lawyer who created and advocated for the adoption of the term after World War II to an unwilling UN, believed that a group did not have to be physically eliminated to experience genocide.\n\nHe argued that the eight components of genocide were “the disintegration of political and social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, religion, and the economic existence of national groups, and the destruction of the personal security, liberty, health, dignity, and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups.”\n\nI learned, while writing my final paper, that in 1985, Israel began paving a parking lot over the Maman Allah Cemetery, where companions of the Prophet Muhammad and thousands of Islamic scholars were buried. 95% of its graves were exhumed to build the parking lot and — not satire — the Museum of Tolerance, yet to be completed. According to the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the completed museum will address “hate, human dignity and responsibility, and promoting unity and respect among Jews and people of all faiths.”\n\nWhat more can be said? My heart smarts at those professors and classmates who were incredulous in class that history allowed incredible violence and hatred again and again but who now speak about Palestine in hushed tones or not at all.\n\nMonday’s University response makes me ashamed to be associated with Pitt, as does its silence on Gaza all these months. This university is willing to chill student free expression and shell out thousands of dollars toward a violent police force that beats its own students bloody seemingly in the name of protecting the Cathedral grass from bald spots. Yet it will not say “Palestine.” It’s simpler to maintain a facade of academic neutrality as thousands of children near death by starvation and their parents and siblings lose their limbs and lives.\n\nWhy is it so incredible to believe that students feel deep empathy for people being murdered and living under occupation and seek actual redress? Why is it controversial that no university should have any investments in any entities remotely connected to any military? Why is it not standard policy for public universities to make their endowment portfolios public?\n\nI urge Pitt administrators to have the courage to join the ranks of universities turning toward Palestinian liberation. Pitt, your education has taught me again and again that the world shouldn’t be this way. Palestine will be free, and unwillingness to be part of that process will forever be an example taught in your classrooms of complicity. Go sit in on your own lessons."
