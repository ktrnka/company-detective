  "summary_markdown": "# About Classmates\n\nClassmates.com, founded on January 1, 1995, is a social networking service based in Seattle, Washington. It primarily focuses on connecting high school alumni, allowing users to find and reconnect with former classmates. The platform boasts over 70 million members and features the largest online library of digitized yearbooks, with more than 300,000 yearbooks available. This service helps members reconnect, reminisce, engage, and plan reunions with their classmates [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/classmates-com).\n\nClassmates generates revenue through advertising and partnerships, leveraging its large user base and unique offerings. The platform's primary customers are individuals looking to reconnect with former schoolmates, making it a B2C business model.\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nInformation about specific executives at Classmates is limited in the available sources. However, the leadership team is likely focused on addressing the challenges posed by competition and evolving user expectations in the social media space.\n\n# News\n\n## Company Developments\n\nClassmates has historically relied on advertising revenue and partnerships to sustain its operations. While there are no recent reports of fundraising events specifically for Classmates, the platform raised $11 million in funding on January 7, 2000 [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/classmates-com).\n\n## Product and User Experience\n\nClassmates has undergone several changes to adapt to the evolving social media environment. These changes include updates to its user interface and the introduction of new features aimed at enhancing user engagement. However, the platform has struggled to keep pace with competitors, leading to discussions about its long-term viability.\n\n## Public Perception and Feedback\n\nFeedback on Classmates tends to be mixed. Some users appreciate the platform for its nostalgic value and ability to reconnect with old friends, while others criticize it for being outdated compared to newer social media platforms. Sentiment on platforms like Reddit often skews negative, with users expressing frustration over user interface issues and the relevance of the platform in today's digital landscape.\n\n## Miscellaneous News\n\n- Classmates rallied to help release a woman from immigration detention [(Nicole Acevedo, Yahoo News, 2020-02-14)](https://news.yahoo.com/classmates-rally-help-release-young-185300770.html).\n- A school shooting was thwarted after a student overheard a threat targeting classmates [(TIME, 2018-01-27)](http://time.com/5121596/uniontown-high-school-shooting/).\n- An article featured photos of Donald Trump in high school [(Allan Smith, Business Insider, 2017-03-31)](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-high-school-photos-2017-3).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nClassmates remains a nostalgic platform for many users, providing a unique service that connects individuals through shared educational experiences. While it faces challenges in maintaining relevance in a competitive market, its focus on community and reconnection continues to resonate with a significant user base. Prospective candidates and investors should consider the platform's historical significance and potential for growth in a niche market.

      "# Post ID f51fx2: Received an email from classmates.com about account registration using my real full name. But I didn't make the account and the password is something I've never used. with +15 score by [(fritocloud, Reddit, 2020-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/f51fx2/received_an_email_from_classmatescom_about/)\nClassmates.com... sounds familiar right? The kings of spam. They came out before Facebook and friendster but they went with the premium model and I had assumed they would have went out of business. I know they were sued at one point for deceptive advertising practices because they would email you saying that something was happening with your account but you had to pay to see what it was. And then when you paid, you would discover that nothing was happening with your account. Well, I just got an email from them welcoming me to the site. The thing is, I didn't make an account with them. I honestly can't remember if I ever made one with this email account (I know I signed up with them at some point but I'm pretty sure I was still using an AOL account at the time, lol. And that was many many years ago.) Anyways, I've gotten emails like this before where someone is using my email address with random info and I just assume it is some sort of scammer or spammer or bots or whatever. I usually go in and report or deactivate the account and no big deal. But this is the first time it has ever happened with my real first and last name. The other weird thing is they are using my full first name and for most things that I sign up for, I use a shortened version of my name. Which makes it less likely they got my name from one of those data leaked lists but not impossible. \n\nThere is a button to report the account for \"being made in error\" but that's the final twist to this. I really don't trust classmates.com and I really don't want to click that link in the email until I know what's going on. The way I see it, this could just be a diabolical plot on classmates.com's part, trying to get customers for their site or whatever.\n\nSo, I guess what I'm looking for is any advice on how to handle this. I should note that I do monitor my credit reports pretty thoroughly so I'm not too worried about any kind of identity theft issues with my SSN attached. Also, has anyone else had this happen to them? With this specific site or another site? Does anyone have any idea how this would happen? I very much doubt it is a real person who just coincidentally has my exact name and that they mistakenly put *my* email address (which is fairly unique and does not have my name in it at all) in when they were signing up.\n\n[Here is a screenshot with my info and the info from the fraudulent account omitted.](http://imgur.com/a/FwRkO4G)\n\nAlso, [here is some dogtax](http://imgur.com/gallery/TzWkUWO) (not mine found it on imgur while uploading my screenshot. So cute.)\n\nThanks in advance, everyone.\n\n## Comment ID fhw7bmr with +13 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/f51fx2/received_an_email_from_classmatescom_about/fhw7bmr/) (in reply to ID f51fx2):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID fhwa4rw with +7 score by [(fritocloud, Reddit, 2020-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/f51fx2/received_an_email_from_classmatescom_about/fhwa4rw/) (in reply to ID fhw7bmr):\nJust the hope, though.

It’s a clear attempt to find age, hometown, and photos of job candidates. Has it really come down to this? I’ve taken down everything except for deleting the account entirely. By default the nature of the Classmates platform is that it lists your schools’ location and graduation date.

Nearly every potential employer is going to do a quick look either before the interviews or after while they are considering applicants.

I deactivated my Facebook in 2015, but reactivated it in 2021 when I was job hunting. I have since maintained it similarly to my LinkedIn. Never had anything else as I really didn't care, I never post anyway.  \n\n\n Reddit is basically 4chan with forced usernames. Similar to forums I used to post on. This site is almost completely anon with the exception the leadership having an email and it's your choice if that email matters or not as an identifier. \n\n\n I have noticed an uptick on Reddit lately though of people who think short account age and lack of history is sus. I delete and remake my reddit accounts constantly.\n\n\n The younger generation is terminally online to their detriment. They seem to place value in having an online identity that is tied to their real world counter which I personally will never understand.  \n\n\n This makes me an \"old\", which is why I have a public facing Facebook, because \"old people use Facebook\". If they can find a Facebook they will just say oh they are old rather than even bringing up that it's sus that I have a minimal online footprint.\n\n#### Comment ID lrbwisu with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-10-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1fy6ars/should_we_delete_our_classmates_com_accounts/lrbwisu/) (in reply to ID lqtzykd):\nI keep an alt reddit account that's less opinionated just incase they want a list of accounts\n\n#### Comment ID lrcehqa with +1 score by [(Lex_Orandi, Reddit, 2024-10-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1fy6ars/should_we_delete_our_classmates_com_accounts/lrcehqa/) (in reply to ID lqtzykd):\nMy sister in law discouraged my wife from going on a second date with me because I wasn’t anywhere to be found on social media.

The Work Number has so much information about your previous employment including salary, vacation and sick time taken, if you were enrolled in benefits or 401k, how much your deductions were, etc.\n\nImagine you are getting paid $80k at your current job and you apply for a job with an advertised salary of $95k. You try to be casual about it during the interview and say \"I'm looking for at least $95k. I make just a bit less than that at my current job, so with my experience and tenure I feel like $95k is fair compensation.\" They say \"Yep, sounds fair, that's right in line with our budget for this position.\" And then they pull your background check, including your job history through TWN, and find out you currently only make $80k, and lowball you at $84k.

Which means they can narrow that search down.\n\n3)  It is highly likely there are services companies are using not just the hiring manager or HR googling.\n\n## Comment ID lqrs9il with +1 score by [(Slim_Margins1999, Reddit, 2024-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1fy6ars/should_we_delete_our_classmates_com_accounts/lqrs9il/) (in reply to ID 1fy6ars):\nNever even heard of it…\n\n## Comment ID lqs2jkr with +1 score by [(LostButterflyUtau, Reddit, 2024-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1fy6ars/should_we_delete_our_classmates_com_accounts/lqs2jkr/) (in reply to ID 1fy6ars):\nAll my social media is fandom shit I use an alias for because I make it a point to keep my real life and fandom life separate.

Jobs were one of the main reasons. I personally would not tie my name to anything if I can avoid it, and I set my privacy settings to as strict as I can. Like on Facebook, you can search my name or email all day, and you won't find me because it is not publicly available. I don't use my real name for Twitter, YouTube, or anything I can avoid. Really, just Facebook has my name, and unless I find you, you can't see my Facebook. And I don't even say or do things that I am worried about, I just like my privacy. \n\nYou never know what you say today that won't be okay tomorrow. Could also be as dumb as the person looking you up for a job might see you are an Ohio State fan, and they love Michigan, so they decide you're not the person for them.

Jockington — a purehearted jock — just radiates LG vibes somehow.\n\nNeutral: Berdly (Lawful), Catti (Neutral), Kris (Chaotic)\n\nReasoning: You really think the resident prankster is anything other than chaotic? Catti is too apathetic to be lawful *or* chaotic.

But instead of using that power to toy with peoples lives for the sake of curiousity, Ralsei does his best to avoid that type of disaster. He knows that Kris has this power, and he knows the dangers of it. \n\nInstead of asking please never do a true reset like Flowey does at the end of credits. Ralsei is lying to Kris, specifically to fool us(the players) into thinking he is on our side, while he is slowly building a way to get rid of the Determination power from Kris. He is on the good side with good intentions, but he is not on OUR side. Even if it's a pacifist run, he still thinks it's too dangerous to have such power, so away it must go.\n\nI mentioned this theory on an r/ralsei poll [recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/ralsei/comments/pcxkrg/what_direction_would_you_like_ralsei_to_go_in/).\n\n### Comment ID hb4jkhd with +7 score by [(Grand_reaper658, Reddit, 2021-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb4jkhd/) (in reply to ID hb3mr3i):\ntemmie adventure?\n\n#### Comment ID hb5h2o5 with +2 score by [(KittyWarrior1, Reddit, 2021-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb5h2o5/) (in reply to ID hb4jkhd):\nyAYA!!!\n\n### Comment ID hb6pd5y with +6 score by [(M-striker, Reddit, 2021-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb6pd5y/) (in reply to ID hb3mr3i):\nThis….\n\nI want to believe is a metaphor, mostly in FARMING EXP: whenever kris/soul/frisk gets EXP his DETERMINATION increases, a power that gives him the ability to RESET, SAVE, ETC.

Jockington wears sunglasses; one of the purple items is ‘Cloudy Glasses,’ Temmie wears a brimmed cap; ‘Cowboy hat,’ Noelle is associated with christmas; you tie gift boxes up with Ribbons, and a toy knife is a potential gift. Snowy is very defensive about his comedy and potentially uses humor as a defense to begin with, and the green heart items are very defensive focused gear. Monster kid is pretty brave, considering he can stand up to Undyne, while he is wearing orange and I guess the glove is just kind of ironic. We don’t get a good look at Catti’s normal get-up, but being a waitress does require some level of grace a la ballet. As for Berdley, maybe it makes a bit more sense if you think of there being two red souls; Chara and Frisk, and thus they’re sort of rivals who aren’t that different in the end? I wouldn’t be surprised if Berdley turns out to have a similar situation to Kris, with Noelle being their only ‘friend.’\n\n#### Comment ID hb4e9o4 with +7 score by [(_AntiSocialMedia, Reddit, 2021-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb4e9o4/) (in reply to ID hb4crx4):\nThing is, so far, everyone in Deltarune has the same personality as their Undertale counterparts, different relationships and different jobs, yeah, but still the same personality.\n\nAnd, well, Snowy just isn't *that* nice in Undertale, he straight up calls Frisk unfunny if they tell a joke because he's jealous, and we know it's jealousy, and not Frisk just being unfunny, because even *Ice Cap* and *Jerry* think Frisk's jokes are funny.\n\n### Comment ID hbll4vn with +4 score by [(TheLegend2T, Reddit, 2021-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hbll4vn/) (in reply to ID hb4adde):\nII like how there's no debate Jockington is Perseverance\n\n## Comment ID hb3bz7g with +12 score by [(pascuales, Reddit, 2021-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb3bz7g/) (in reply to ID pfcg31):\nMakes sense considering that we have the main characters (Frisk; Kris, Susie and Ralsei) but in Undertale we wouldn't be able to win without the souls' help.

Her family lives in that one far away house in the canyons of Snowdin forest. After Rudy died, Carol became a lot more over-protective of her daughters, and shelters them. So Noelle and Dess don't usually get to see other people aside from when they sneak off into town. Dess is also pretty protective of Noelle. Those two sheltering her, as well as her not being around other kids her age means that Noelle won't break out of her shell as much as she did in Deltarune. She's a lot more quiet and nervous around others, and is pretty attached at the heel to Dess.\n\nSnowdrake also lives in Snowdin forest. He's seen Noelle's mom and is, terrified of her. This leads to him telling MK, who spreads rumors about this terrifying deer woman and her two daughters to the other kids\n\nSusie, Berdly, Catti, Jockington, and MK all live in New Home \n\nSusie has a better life than in Deltarune. Whatever happened to her (orphaned, ran away, human parents, what have you) didn't happen here, and she just lives with her parents in New Home. She's still brash and rude, but everyone knows her. Unlike deltarune, her peers aren't scared of her and have accepted her eccentricities. Main issue I have with her is that I don't know what kids, do. On a day to day basis. Like I doubt she'd pay much mind to her future when she's like 10. Maybe she'd pull pranks around town sorta like Kris did when they were younger?\n\nAlso Clamgirl mentions that 'Suzy' is her neighbor's daughter, which is, interesting. Maybe I could have the Goners have an interest in her, for some reason?\n\nBerdly I have two ideas for. Dunno which one to choose.\n\nIdea 1: He's basically the same as in Deltarune. He still won a spelling bee, except this time he didn't have Noelle to compete with, and still equates his self worth to smarts. Still smug, but more tired as he doesn't have anyone to help him study. He either wants to work as a Core engineer or a royal scientist when he's older. If the former I'll have him look up to Ms. Boom, if the latter, I'll have him look up to Alphys\n\nIdea 2: The spelling bee didn't happen and he doesn't equate his self worth with smarts. Instead, he befriended Susie. They're both tough (Berdly has crazy states in his battle. I think Susie does more damage, but Berdly has a lot of HP), like video games, and are kinda dumb. With this option I could also see Berdly having an interest in the royal guard, though I worry that'll make him too similar to Papyrus\n\nAnd with Catti and Jockington, they'll just be the same as Deltarune. Jock does sports, Catti does black magic, and they're friends\n\nSo yeah. Lemme know if this sounds in character, which idea for Berdly is better, and what y'all think and if y'all have any ideas\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sprites](https://preview.redd.it/u5o2dpzzrdgb1.png?width=2320&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbea0dcdf84ee5bd2bfa2d653273ffd72c767ed9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Possible royal guard trainee Berdly designs](https://preview.redd.it/y4sdtmzxsdgb1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=32641fb87eddf8bbcf9b60c99c8cf730abb87884)\n\n## Comment ID juyxeld with +5 score by [(Lemoineau11, Reddit, 2023-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/15jb38u/the_undertale_versions_of_kris_classmates/juyxeld/) (in reply to ID 15jb38u):\nI don't have anything to add except I see Rudy as part of an amalgamate.

In 82 tech still\nHad a very robust corps of cadets. If he was in that they can help. If your dad was in a fraternity, check with the tech and the national charter and see if they can help. Also, check with the department that your dad majored in. Around this time people get nostalgic for the good old days and they get in contact w the department. Most of his professors will have retired, but the dept usually has an alumni database. Good luck, I hope you are successful.",
      "# Post ID 18e16dx: Any Given Friday #14 - “Classmates “ with +32 score by [(Jefcat, Reddit, 2023-12-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GivenAnime/comments/18e16dx/any_given_friday_14_classmates/)\nA substantial portion of the first arc of Given takes place in Ritsuka and Mafuyu’s high school. Their classmates help drive the early exposition. We meet Itaya and Ueki, but also Ayano Kasai and Waka Kurihara. \n\n Kasai, of course, is interested in Ritsuka and is jealous of Mafuyu and outs him to Ritsuka. She redeems herself later and even helps Mafuyu along towards the end of the manga.\n\nKurihara, who is very kindhearted, already has a boyfriend, who was coincidentally Mafuyu’s classmate in Middle School. Unfortunately, we never learn boyfriend-chan’s name or see his face.  From behind, at least, he looks handsome and well watched for Waka.  Not too tall, with spikey hair a bit like Itaya’s. I wish we’d gotten better acquainted with him. \n\nOne more classmate we met briefly was Hosokai-kun, who appears playing basketball at lunchtime with the rest of the boys. And Kizu uses him briefly when demonstrating the uniforms and fashions open to the students.

She ended up giving Mafuyu some >!much needed advice to help him move forward in his life with Ritsuka and get him to the syh debut.!<  Kizu never ceases to amaze me, and I am sure it was deliberate to draw Kasai to look like a female version of Mafuyu.  She likes to mix things up a bit I think.  Kasai has a romantic interest in Ritsuka, but Ritsuka falls in the love with the male version, Mafuyu.  Kasai and Mafuyu look like siblings.  They have the most beautiful expressive eyes. \n\nI, of course, would liked to have seen more of Waka and Hosokai.  I thought Hosokai would have a bigger role the way he was set up early in the manga.  Waka looks very stylish in the last official art of all the characters.\n\n### Comment ID kcrwg2h with +2 score by [(Jefcat, Reddit, 2023-12-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GivenAnime/comments/18e16dx/any_given_friday_14_classmates/kcrwg2h/) (in reply to ID kcrunif):\nAs ever with Kizu, her characters leave me wanting more.

I know you think that because you're a VP you know more than the rest of us, but look back over the last three years.  See all that failure and waste of money & time?  Those were all your GREAT ideas.  \r\n\r\n3. YOU CAN'T SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH ANOTHER ROUND OF LAYOFFS.

The future of the company almost seems as if it is being decided by a blindfolded man throwing darts. The Communications segment of UOL is currently still shackled to the dial-up ISP business, and after flopping around trying other directions, has now decided to gamble on the mobile broadband sector - except that they are using tech that is already 5 years out-of-date and trying to market it to a demographic that's still confused by cell phones.",

      "# [Redbird Legacy: Being classmates brought mother and daughter closer together on 2024-05-07](https://news.illinoisstate.edu/2024/05/redbird-legacy-being-classmates-brought-mother-and-daughter-closer-together/)\nCheering from the audience above a sea of black caps and brightly colored cords, Benedicte Kazigwa ’23 watched her mother receive a master’s degree knowing her own graduation was only a semester away. Edna Milanga ’21, MBA ’23, and her daughter attended Illinois State at the same time.\n\nAppears In Illinois State: Spring 2024\n\nOriginally from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Milanga started her academic journey at Heartland Community College, earning an associate degree and making her way through English as a second language classes before transferring to Illinois State to earn a bachelor’s degree in international business. Milanga later enrolled in Illinois State’s MBA program. Kazigwa wasn’t far behind, transferring to Illinois State for its computer networking and telecommunications program.\n\nTheir mother-daughter bond only grew when they became Illinois State classmates. Milanga and Kazigwa made time for each other during the week, meeting for meals and running errands together.\n\n“She was (on campus) early in the morning, and I would be there in the afternoon,” said Milanga. “Sometimes we would go for lunch in Watterson and have a good time.

Since motor-voter laws have encouraged people to register to vote when they get their licenses in high school, students who study out-of-state can face a choice between absentee voting at home or re-registering in a new state where they may not understand the issues.\n\nFor Elon University students, Associate Professor of Journalism Amanda Sturgill’s Multiplatform News Editing class has addressed this issue by creating a student-centered voter guide for races in the states from which Elon draws the most students: Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia.\n\n“Elon prides itself on having civic engagement in students, and a lot of students choose to vote at home,” said Sarah Moore ’26, a junior studying journalism. “We wanted to make sure there are resources on campus for students voting absentee at home, the same way there are for students voting in Alamance County.”\n\nIn September, the 18 students in the journalism class – with support from the Elon Votes initiative – began the project assembling focus groups of first-time voters. The editing students were trained in conducting the groups and led a discussion with the new voters on what issues mattered to them. Across the groups, gun rights and control, healthcare and abortion, housing and taxes, immigration, and climate change were the top issues.\n\nThe students identified the candidates who will be on the ballot for each statewide or federal level race and began an extensive process of finding the candidates’ positions on each of these issues. In some cases, it was as easy as visiting a candidate’s website, but other candidates were hard to track down requiring emails, phone calls and social media messages.\n\nThe challenges to access information surprised some students. “You’d think someone running for office would want people to know what they think,” said Moore, who served as the student director of the project, keeping up with more than 80 races.\n\nThe raw information went through two rounds of copy edits before putting it on the site.",

Riley always shared her phone’s location with her friends, Tiller said.\n\nRiley’s body was found with “visible injuries” in a forested area behind Lake Herrick on Thursday, police have said. She had gone out for a jog at the Intramural Fields that morning, and when she didn’t return hours later, her friend called the police.\n\nRiley died of blunt force trauma.\n\nThe suspect, identified as Jose Antonio Ibarra, 26, of Athens, has been charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, police said Friday.\n\nThere was no indication that Ibarra and Riley knew each other, according to UGA Police Chief Jeff Clark, who called it a “crime of opportunity” and said there was no further threat to the campus. Ibarra was being held in the Clarke County Jail.\n\nRoommates, friends remember Riley as selfless, loving\n\nLilly Steiner, another friend from UGA, thanked Riley in a tribute posted Saturday on Instagram for “helping me find the joy in life.”\n\n“You put everyone before yourself everyday, and you loved like no one else,” Sofia Magana, one of Riley’s roommates at UGA, said on Instagram.\n\n“You were supposed to be by my side on my wedding day, you were supposed to be with us on graduation ... but most importantly you were supposed to be here with us,” Magana wrote.\n\nSophia Palomino said in a tribute post that Riley “taught me so many lessons about life, friendship & sisterhood” and that “her love has changed me for the better.” She added that she admired how Riley was always putting others before herself.\n\nConnolly Huth, who also lived with Riley, recalled their shared memories and said she and Riley were supposed to run their first marathon together.\n\n“I will run that 26.2 in your honor and let everyone know of the perfect, beautiful, hilarious, smart, kind, and driven human that Laken Riley was,” Huth wrote in an Instagram post.\n\nRiley attended the University of Georgia through the spring 2023 semester and was studying at nearby Augusta University College of Nursing at the time of her death. In a statement, the school called her “a promising future nurse” who made the dean’s list in the fall.\n\nA GoFundMe page was set up in Riley’s honor to help her family with funeral costs and with hopes of starting a scholarship in her name.\n\nCommunity reeling from Riley’s death\n\nOn Saturday, security waited outside the Alpha Chi Omega sorority house, where Riley was still an active member, as students with flowers in their hands rushed to and from their cars, heads down and focused, wearing a grim look.\n\nThe tension on the campus Saturday was palpable.\n\nOne student clutched pepper spray as she crossed the street. She said up until this week, it was gathering dust in her car.\n\nA small memorial grew by Lake Herrick, where Riley was last seen alive, as well as by the famed UGA arch. Students who never met Riley gave it a somber acknowledgement as they walked past.\n\n“It’s really upsetting. I know that I love to run, and so to know that that could’ve been me, that could’ve been anyone on this campus, it’s just terrible. It could be anybody,” UGA student Millicent Dye said.\n\nA quiet fear also lurks just off campus among a pocket of Venezuelans living in Athens.\n\nFrom outside Andreina Rivas’ apartment in the same community as Ibarra, she described in Spanish the shock and fear of seeing police swarming her street, only to find out it was because the suspect, whom she’d never met, was living just down the road from her.\n\nRivas threw her hands up in frustration, re-enacting the moment she said she found out the suspect’s family was Venezuelan, like her.\n\nRivas said that in a group chat with other Venezuelans, some expressed fears that locals would “come after Venezuelans.”\n\nSuspect’s brother also facing legal trouble\n\nThe suspect’s brother, Diego Ibarra, 29, was also taken into custody Friday and federally charged with possessing a fraudulent green card, according to a release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Georgia.\n\nDiego Ibarra is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela, the U.S. attorney’s office said. He was also being held in the Clarke County Jail. It was not immediately clear if he had retained legal representation.\n\nHe was approached by police Friday because he matched the description of the suspect in the investigation into Riley’s death, the U.S. attorney’s office said. He allegedly showed officers his fake green card as a form of identification.\n\nPolice determined the card to be fraudulent and charged Diego Ibarra. He is being held in state custody and faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if convicted, according to the U.S. attorney’s office.\n\nA spokesperson for UGA said he was fired from his position at the university after they learned of the alleged fake green card.\n\n“Diego Ibarra presented a fake green card to the hiring unit to begin a temporary position as a dishwasher in Bolton Dining Hall at the University of Georgia on Feb. 6, 2024,” the spokesperson said. “He subsequently failed to submit further documentation required to keep the job and was never paid by the University.”\n\nHe has been arrested three times on nonviolent offenses since he came to the U.S., according to the U.S. attorney’s office.\n\nJose Ibarra’s arrest has started a political firestorm within the conservative movement regarding immigration and border policy.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp demanded answers from President Joe Biden on Ibarra’s immigration status and asylum claims by his brother.\n\n“Laken Riley’s tragic death struck the hearts of Georgians everywhere and has rightfully sparked national outrage,” Kemp said in a statement. “As I have said many times before: every state is now a border state because of Joe Biden’s inaction, and today I am again demanding answers and information from the Biden Administration that will help us protect our citizens when the federal government will not.”\n\nJose Ibarra is not a U.S. citizen, police said. His immigration status was not clear. A public defender who represented Ibarra at a bond hearing did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Sunday.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Ibarra was arrested by Customs and Border Protection on Sept. 8, 2022, after unlawfully entering the country near El Paso, Texas.\n\nHe was paroled and released for further processing, but was arrested on Sept. 14, 2023, by the New York Police Department and charged with “acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation,” ICE said.\n\nThe NYPD released Ibarra before ICE could issue a detainer — a request that a law enforcement agency keep hold of non-citizens who have been arrested on criminal charges and are eligible for deportation so that ICE can take them into custody — the immigration agency said.\n\nICE said it issued a detainer for Ibarra following his arrest Friday.\n\nSuspect’s neighbors recall police swarming complex\n\nJennifer Slonaker and Ricky Carter, husband and wife, live in the Argo Apartment Community in Athens in one of the units above where Ibarra was living.\n\n“We’d see him out and about. There wasn’t a lot of conversation because we think he spoke Spanish. Nothing out of the ordinary. They seemed normal enough, everyone in that apartment. Three men and a woman,” Slonaker said.\n\nAround noon Friday, the couple said they saw police swarm the complex.\n\n“There wasn’t an inch of this place that didn’t have a cop on it. … They knocked and search every door in this complex, but they started with the one downstairs. They knew what and who they were looking for,” Slonaker said.\n\nThe couple described seeing Ibarra walk away in handcuffs. He didn’t look around, remained quiet and focused ahead of him, they said. His brother Diego followed in handcuffs shortly thereafter.\n\nSlonaker and her husband spoke to NBC News from outside their apartment, sharing details in between drags on a cigarette. Their regular smoke breaks are, in part, why they noticed the forensics team downstairs didn’t leave Ibarra’s apartment until 2:30 Saturday morning.\n\nCarter looked around, almost hesitating to keep his voice from traveling downstairs for a moment.\n\n“Makes me feel some type of way you can be amongst a killer and not even know it,” he said.\n\nMarissa Parra reported from Athens, Georgia, and Rebecca Cohen from New York City.",
      "# [Classmates for 4 Years, ‘Colleagues for Life’: NC State Pathology Class of 2024 Students Celebrate Residency Placements by Katie Rice on 2024-05-01](https://news.cvm.ncsu.edu/class-of-2024-pathology-focus/)\nFive students from the NC State College of Veterinary Medicine’s Class of 2024 are headed for pathology residencies after graduation, a notably high number for a small and often unsung specialization within veterinary medicine.\n\nEvery graduating NC State student who applied to a pathology residency program was admitted, says fourth-year William Benedict, who matched into a combined clinical pathology residency and Ph.D. program at Colorado State University.\n\n“Pathology residencies can be quite difficult to get into due to the limited availability of spots that are offered per institution,” Benedict says. “This is an exceptional feat.”\n\nThe future residents are joining programs in anatomical, clinical and zoological pathology across the United States. Their residencies last three to four years on average, during which the students will receive advanced training in the diagnosis and monitoring of diseases by examining animal cells, tissues and fluid samples.\n\nIn addition to Benedict, the other students are Emma Ferraro, who matched into a zoological anatomic pathology residency run by the University of Illinois and the Brookfield Zoo; Erica Ramaker-Erlandson, who is establishing a digital and comparative pathology fellowship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; and Stephanie Anderson and Elizabeth Browder, who are heading into anatomic and clinical pathology residencies, respectively, at the University of Missouri.\n\nDr. Abigail Armwood, an assistant clinical professor who advises NC State’s pathology focus area and co-coordinates its anatomic pathology residency program with Dr. Elizabeth Rose, says the students have impressive qualifications. These include nine publications in peer-reviewed journals, four of which are first-author papers, and 10 poster presentations at the American College of Veterinary Pathologists’ national conference.\n\n“I’m very impressed by these students’ accomplishments,” she says. “They’ve taken advantage of a lot of different opportunities to learn more about pathology and become more involved in the field. It’s been incredibly exciting to mentor them and see them grow into graduates heading into residencies.”\n\nThese pathologists-in-training say College of Veterinary Medicine professors like Armwood encouraged their interests in pathology and helped them use the college’s resources to immerse themselves in the field.\n\n“When I took the clinical pathology course my second year, I completely fell in love with it,” Browder says. “I’ve always been into Nancy Drew and mystery novels, and I thought clinical pathology was like solving tiny mysteries that were really complex and different for every patient. Taking the advanced clinical pathology selective later on really cemented my interest in and love for it.”\n\nTheir journeys weren’t always smooth. The cohort started veterinary school at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when large classes and hospital rounds were held virtually. For some, their first hands-on pathology experience involved socially distanced, limited-space shifts in the Veterinary Hospital’s histology lab and necropsy floor.\n\nThe group grew closer as the college returned to regular operations, leaning on one another through intense courses, sharing interesting cases from their student-worker positions in the Veterinary Hospital’s pathology labs and bonding in clubs like PathHeads — communally “speaking the pathology language,” as Benedict puts it.\n\nTheir conversations covered everything from recommending externship and research experiences to discussing how to boost residency applications. The students often consulted NC State pathology residents and faculty on the different opportunities available to them.\n\n“I used vet school to feel out the different big avenues of pathology careers, namely diagnostics, academia and industry,” Ramaker-Erlandson says. “Dr. Danielle Meritet was instrumental in helping me understand what those fields look like, and I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunities that the CVM has been able to provide for me.”\n\nIn particular, the students recognized assistant clinical professor Meritet, Armwood, associate clinical professor Devorah Stowe, clinical veterinarian Dr. Brigid Troan and assistant professor Dr. Erika Gruber as instrumental in guiding them through courses, labs and research opportunities including the Veterinary Scholars Program.\n\nThe classmates’ bond strengthened over the past year with the challenges and excitement of completing clinical rotations and submitting residency applications, Ferraro says.\n\nWhen universities began extending residency offers in October, around the time the group attended the American College of Veterinary Pathologists’ annual conference together, every match prompted mutual celebration.\n\n“I was ecstatic,” Anderson says. “I felt like I finally did it, after all that hard and extra work I put in to try to stand out for these programs finally paid off. And it was just so exciting to see that all my friends had also gotten offers. I was really proud of everybody.”\n\nAnd now these friends share the anticipation of their next steps. As they tackle the logistics of cross-country moves and prepare to scatter the nation after the Oath and Hooding ceremony this weekend, they say one thing is for certain: They’ll stay in touch.\n\nAnderson and Browder hope to explore Columbia, Missouri, together and look forward to sharing an office at the university. Ferraro says the larger group has arranged future virtual studying sessions for their board certification exams, and she plans to visit Benedict as soon as he’s settled.\n\n“He was showing me his new place in Colorado, and I already marked off the loft as my bedroom for when I’m there,” Ferraro says.\n\nPathology is a small world, and these graduates’ career paths will cross again even as their routes diverge.\n\n“We’ve had each other through vet school, and we’ll have each other as we go through residency with the ups and downs there,” Ramaker-Erlandson says. “And we’ll be colleagues for life, so it’ll be cool to run into each other at conferences and keep in touch.”",

It also said the teacher was initially suspended and then resigned on Nov. 2, before the district could begin termination proceedings.\n\n“IPS does not tolerate the type of behavior alleged in the complaint and takes reports of potential abuse and neglect seriously,” the district's statement said. “When IPS learned of the teacher’s conduct, the Department of Child Services (DCS) was immediately notified, and the teacher was removed from the classroom and suspended. The teacher had no further contact with students and is no longer employed by IPS.”\n\nThe district also said it was not made aware of the allegations the teacher encouraged fights until the parent emailed the principal on the evening of Oct. 30. But the principal did not see the email until the next morning and immediately contacted the Department of Child Services and the school system’s human resources personnel, the district said.\n\nA spokesperson for the district said Thursday that Johnson, the superintendent, and the school principal would not comment on the allegations.\n\nAttempts to reach Johnican, who is described as a first-year teacher in the district in the suit, were unsuccessful Thursday afternoon. Phone calls to numbers associated with his relatives were not answered.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the second grader was “thrown to the ground, struck, slapped, and hit in the head repeatedly\" in at least three attacks.\n\nJohnican, the suit says, held the child on two occasions while “allowing other students to punch, hit and kick him.”\n\nThe child’s mother had repeated meetings with Johnican to discuss her son’s allegations, but Johnican dismissed them and attributed the problem to the student’s behavioral issues and said the student was lying or mentally ill, the lawsuit says.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, on Sept. 22, the child’s mother told the vice principal of the allegations after she was called to the school because her son was hysterical and unable to calm down.\n\nHis mother went to the school that day and observed him in the classroom for 45 minutes. That day, her son again told her he was being abused in school, the suit says.\n\n“O.D. informed his mother that in the teacher’s presence and by his direction that another student had slammed his head down on a desk, pulled him to the floor, and then hit him repeatedly in the head. He directly indicated this was being done at the instruction of his teacher Mr. Johnican,” the lawsuit said.\n\nThe child, according to the suit, began asking to avoid school, and his grades slipped.\n\nOn Nov. 1, his parents had a meeting with Johnican, who intended to show a video of his classroom’s environment but instead inadvertently began showing a video of the student being attacked, the suit says.\n\n“When the parent attempted to grab the phone, he inadvertently turned up the volume where the parents could hear that it was him, the teacher, instigating and encouraging the beating of their disabled seven-year-old child,” according to the lawsuit.\n\n“The distressing content of the video made by Johnican shows O.D. on the floor crying as he is repeatedly punched in the face and head by a peer who is sitting on top of him as he cries out and begs for the attack to cease,\" it says.\n\nIn an interview with the Department of Child Services, the student said that he was assaulted twice in October and that Johnican held him down in one instance while a first grader slapped his face, according to the suit. And in a second alleged incident, Johnican held his shoulders while another student punched him in the stomach and kicked him in his legs, the suit said.\n\nSome of the claims in the lawsuit include negligent care and supervision; negligent hiring, retention and supervision; and intentional infliction of serious emotional distress.\n\nThe child is now homeschooled, he has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and he is in therapy at least once a week, the lawsuit said.\n\nThe suit requests a jury trial and says damages will be determined at trial.",

So I was really excited about just having my class be part of where I'm heading next, you know?\" the Arkansas boy told \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nLuke's May 14 adoption was the culmination of months of bonding, a process he and his parents, Cassie and Bradley Kissinger, said was nearly instantaneous after they first met at a \"connection event\" hosted by Project Zero, an Arkansas nonprofit dedicated to promoting adoption.\n\n\"We started playing games at the event and those events can be a little awkward but it was actually not at all with [Luke],\" Cassie Kissinger recalled. \"I just kind of jumped in and started helping him with things and we walked around and we talked a lot. We got lunch together. So all the awkwardness went away really quickly.\"\n\nFor Cassie Kissinger, adopting Luke has been a longtime dream come true.\n\n\"I grew up in a family that fostered and adopted out of foster care. So I always wanted to do that. That was a dream of mine since I was a teenager,\" she told \"GMA.\"\n\nOn his adoption day, Luke said he was nervous, excited and overall, felt \"all the feelings combined.\"\n\n\"It was really fun but we had emotional parts too,\" he said.\n\nNow, the rising fifth grader calls Cassie and Bradley Kissinger mom and dad and also has a brother Aiden, also 11, and an older sister Alena, 14.\n\nAiden told \"GMA\" \"it's pretty exciting\" to welcome a brother into the Kissinger family fold.\n\n\"I mean, it gets annoying like other siblings, but we get along pretty well,\" he said, adding that he particularly enjoys playing video games with Luke or playing outside together in their backyard.\n\nThe Kissingers say for other families considering adoption, it's a journey that's well worth it.\n\n\"The kids don't want perfect. They don't need perfect. They just need someone to love them,\" Cassie Kissinger said. \"A lot of these kids have been waiting many years in foster care to be adopted and find a permanent family and it can truly change the trajectory of their life if they find that permanency.\"\n\n\"If you actually look at the statistics, the number of kids out there that just need some love is staggering. It's ridiculously high and I mean if you can be a part of changing even one of those kids' lives, go for it. Don't hold back,\" Bradley Kissinger added.",
      "# [What Surprised me (in a good way) about my 1st year of Optometry school on 2024-10-11](https://www.ketchum.edu/about-us/news-mbku/what-surprised-me-good-way-about-my-1st-year-optometry-school-0)\nWhen people think about grad school, one of the first things that crosses their minds (or at least mine) is whether or not we’re ready both academically and mentally. When considering the timeline of school, I went in with the thought that optometry school would be this 4-year gap in my early 20s where I would be doing nothing but studying and studying and studying. I had a mindset that life would begin once school is over, and that the 4 years in school would be nothing but a worthwhile sacrifice to achieve my goal of becoming an optometrist - just a means to an end.\n\nLittle did I know how wrong I was. Don’t get me wrong - there are many hours of tests, studying, and practicing clinical skills. That was expected. If we hope to become the best providers that we can to serve our patients, we have to put in the work. But by no means has optometry school been that blank 4-year gap of nothing but studying that I was expecting. I would argue that life really began when optometry school started.\n\nThis past year has been so much more than keeping my nose down in a textbook. Just because optometry school is undoubtedly a lot of work, and a lot of time is spent studying, does not mean that optometry school marks the end of who you are and what you enjoyed doing before school. If anything, I would argue that optometry school has become a bridge between the things that I enjoyed before school, and either similar optometry-related activities, or classmates that enjoy the same things.\n\nFor example, I have always had a passion for community service. I’ve had opportunities to do it throughout high school and college, but thought that I would have to take a break for school. I was wrong about that, too - there have been multiple community service opportunities a month, local and abroad, to give back to your community and put the clinical skills you’ve learned so far into practice.\n\nOn the other hand, school has helped me connect with people who have similar interests in things that may not have an optometry-related counterpart. You realize pretty quickly that it isn’t too hard to find someone with similar interests as you. Even though everyone here is linked by a passion for the same profession, there is a huge variety of passions within your class, and the odds of you stumbling across someone who enjoys something that you do is pretty high. Even if there isn’t, people are pretty open to trying new things and sometimes you may even introduce them to a new hobby! I was worried that I’d lose all the things that I did in my free time, but I was super happy to find friends that I could do some of the things I enjoyed with. We’ve had the opportunity to do anything from just working out, to weekend trips, to going to concerts together, which I never in a million years thought I would have the time to do during school.\n\nMy point from all this is that school has been a lot of work, but has also been some of the most fun I’ve ever had. What has surprised me most about optometry school is how you’re able to keep doing and even expand on your hobbies and passions you had before school. Sure, grad school is very, very different from undergrad, but the platform for you to continue to pursue your passions is in place, whether that is through clubs on campus, or connecting with your classmates. Optometry school absolutely follows the “you get out what you put in” rule. There is nothing wrong with going in, getting your degree, and getting out. But just know that if you ever change your mind, your classmates, your faculty, and the rest of your school community are waiting for you, ready to make these 4 years some of the most memorable years of your life.",
      "# [Lady Gaga Responds to Former Classmates Who Said She’d ‘Never Be Famous’ by Jessica Lynch on 2024-09-13](https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/lady-gaga-responds-to-former-classmates-never-be-famous-1235774641/)\nLady Gaga recently responded to an old Facebook group created by some of her ex-classmates, who mocked her dreams of stardom several years ago.\n\nGaga briefly attended NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts before leaving in 2005 to pursue a music career. At the time, she had just started performing under her now-iconic stage name, and word of her performances spread quickly among her peers, leading to the creation of the Facebook group titled “Stefani Germanotta, you will never be famous.”\n\nMembers of the group reportedly ridiculed her dreams of becoming famous, mocking her performances and aspirations.\n\nNow, a TikTok post that has gone viral, screenshots of the now-deleted Facebook group were shown, followed by a list of Gaga’s numerous accolades, including her 13 Grammy wins, an Oscar, and a long list of other prestigious awards.\n\nThe “Die With a Smile” singer herself commented on the video, addressing the hate she experienced during her early years: “Some people I went to college [with] made this way back when. This is why you can’t give up when people doubt you or put you down—gotta keep going.”\n\nGaga’s journey to fame wasn’t an overnight success.\n\nAfter leaving college, she began playing small gigs around New York City under the stage name Lady Gaga. Little did her classmates know, she’d go on to release The Fame just a few years later in 2008, with hits like “Just Dance” and “Poker Face” dominating the Billboard charts.\n\nIn 2016, one of her former classmates, Lauren Bohn, shared her memories of the Facebook group, recalling how the members would belittle Gaga’s ambitions and even trample on flyers for her shows.\n\n“I also remember one dude posting a flyer for one of her upcoming gigs at a local village bar. He had clearly stomped on the flyer, an outline of his muddy [sole] struggling to eclipse her name,” Bohn wrote, praising Gaga for sticking to her dreams and breaking through despite the negativity.\n\nSince those early days, Gaga has become one of the most decorated artists in the world. She’s won 13 Grammy Awards, including two for co-writing and performing her A Star Is Born anthem “Shallow,” which also earned her an Oscar.\n\nShe’s landed five No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 and six No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, including Born This Way and Chromatica. Her latest track with Bruno Mars, “Die With a Smile,” also scored the No. 1 spot on Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts.",
      "# [Breaking barriers: Child Life classmates lean on each other as program’s first Black students](https://www.fcs.uga.edu/news/story/breaking-barriers-child-life-classmates-lean-on-each-other-as-programs-first-black-students)\nOver a boxed lunch during a stressful weekend, Aspen Thompson made a new friend.\n\nIn Athens to interview for acceptance into the College of Family and Consumer Sciences’ competitive master’s of science in Child Life program last winter, Thompson admitted she was a little “spooked” by the process.\n\nWhen the candidates met for lunch, Thompson settled into a seat next to JaQuira Wallace. As the two began chatting, a light-hearted exchange marked the beginning of what would become a unique friendship.\n\n“We were joking because she doesn’t like sweets,” Thompson said. “I love sweets, so I traded my fruit for her cookie.”\n\nThompson and Wallace soon discovered more commonalities.\n\nThey both come from military backgrounds. Both of Thompson’s parents were officers in the Navy in California and Texas before retiring to Virginia. Wallace’s father recently retired from a career in the Air Force in South Carolina.\n\nThey learned they shared a Christian faith and they both have wrestled with perfectionist tendencies.\n\nAmong a few other common threads, Thompson and Wallace also have another obvious connection: they’re both Black students, possibly the program’s first in its 30-year history, pursuing a career as Child Life Specialists where Black practitioners make up just 11 percent of the field nationwide.\n\n“We have a lot of shared passions, dreams, convictions and experiences when it comes to being a Black student in general,” Thompson said. “It’s just another layer of closeness, and it’s easy to feel like we’re collaborating and spurring each other on.”\n\n'I just want to help'\n\nChild Life Specialists serve a unique role in the healthcare field. They typically work in hospitals, supporting the psychosocial needs of children and families to help them understand their illness or injury and develop positive coping skills.\n\nFaculty member Diane Bales, professor and UGA Cooperative Extension human development specialist, directs the FACS program, with clinical assistant professor Stephanie Whitten serving as clinical coordinator.\n\nA recent class focused on death and bereavement in which students were presented the following case study:\n\n“You’ve been working in oncology. When you arrive for work, you find out that a 14-year-old boy you have seen on and off for a year died the night before. You tear up when you see his parents. What do you say and do?”\n\nThe students’ discussions covered issues like self-care, establishing professional boundaries and being genuine with children and families.\n\nWhile acknowledging the heaviness of certain aspects of the job, Wallace said she’s convinced she’s exactly where she’s meant to be.\n\n“It sounds cliché, but I just want to help,” she said. “It’s always been a goal of mine to be an advocate for children any way I can. I want to be that person rooting for them when it feels like they don’t have anybody rooting for them.”\n\nWallace’s passion for the field grew out of watching her mother’s interactions with kids in her preschool classroom. Later, an advisor in Wallace’s undergraduate program at the College of Charleston recommended Child Life, and Wallace’s path was set.\n\n“I did my research and thought ‘I could really see myself being successful in this field,’ ” she said.\n\nThompson earned an undergraduate degree in pre-clinical public health at Liberty University, where she also played volleyball, but discovered a passion for Child Life when a family friend’s young son was diagnosed with leukemia.\n\n“His mom just raved about the Child Life specialists on his care team and how it had made such a big difference,” Thompson said. “I had no idea that job had a name, but I really knew that was something I felt called to do and was the sweet spot between my love for medicine and my passion for serving and supporting.”\n\nTheir paths converged at UGA, where they joined a small cohort of four first-year students in the rigorous program in which students are required to complete an internship at a hospital and are then eligible to sit for the Child Life Certification Exam.\n\nIn short, it’s a lot. Both Wallace and Thompson say they’ve been stretched in the program and lean on each other for comfort and encouragement.\n\n“I firmly believe God put Aspen and me in this program together to develop a friendship and be intentional and talk about our experiences as Black students and Black women, and I really appreciate that,” Wallace said. “I know she will always be there for me.”\n\nA culture of support\n\nDiversifying the field of Child Life is a priority for many programs, including FACS.\n\nAccording to the careers website Zippia, 60 percent of Certified Child Life Specialists identify as white and 75 percent are women.\n\nWallace said she has tried to find other Black practitioners on LinkedIn, but has been unsuccessful.\n\n“I’m hoping that’s something that can change,” she said.\n\nWhitten agrees.\n\n“Minority representation in the field of Child Life is vital to diversifying the workforce,” she said. “When children and families see individuals who look like them or share similar backgrounds, they feel more understood and supported, which can positively impact their emotional well-being throughout hospitalization.”\n\nWhile acknowledging the importance of recognizing the gap for existing practitioners of color, Thompson said one of the strengths of the FACS program is the open atmosphere fostered by Bales and Whitten.\n\n“There are so many people rooting for you here,” Thompson said. “Everybody is invited to share and give perspective without it feeling like you’re being called out or embarrassed.”\n\nWallace has had a similar experience. She said she’s had encouraging conversations with both Bales and Whitten about the issue and is optimistic about the future based on her experience at UGA.\n\n“I’ve just really felt comfortable here,” she said. “It feels like a family to me.”",
      "# [Allegheny Classmates Lead Award-Winning Campaign for Disability Air Travel Reform by pdrexel on 2024-11-14](https://allegheny.edu/about/news/allegheny-classmates-lead-award-winning-campaign-for-disability-air-travel-reform/)\nTwo Allegheny College alumni, Mark Fisher ‘08 and Lynn Leclerc (Stinson) ‘08 have made a significant impact on disability rights and air travel reform. Fisher, Director of Advocacy Engagement at the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA), and Leclerc, Vice President of Digital at Strategic Elements, have spent the past year working together on an award-winning digital campaign aimed at improving the air travel experience for people living with disabilities.\n\nSince joining the Muscular Dystrophy Association in 2019, Fisher, a political science major and Spanish minor, was determined to create a project where he filmed the experience of someone living with a disability to show how much of a nightmare air travel is for the community. “Air travel is the only form of transportation not covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),” he says.\n\n“Airlines routinely damage and destroy wheelchairs, passengers with a disability are injured or dropped when they need to transfer from an aisle chair into their airplane seat, and the airplane itself is not accessible. However, it’s one thing to tell lawmakers and the public how awful air travel is for this community, but it’s another thing to actually show it and force people to see it with their own eyes. I knew that would move people to act and demand reform,” Fisher says.\n\nIn 2023, when a major air travel bill was moving through Congress, Fisher teamed up with Leclerc, who majored in political science with a minor in women’s gender, and sexuality studies, to create their video messaging and launch their campaign aimed at tackling the widespread challenges faced by people with disabilities when flying.\n\n“I’ve long admired Mark’s work in the health advocacy space, and I would tap him from time to time to see if my firm could be of any assistance,” Leclerc says. “It was the right place at the right time when Mark said they were seeking a partner for an important Accessible Air Travel campaign, and I jumped at the chance to team up with an old friend and advance a critical mission.”\n\nThe campaign raised awareness through two documentary-style videos that followed wheelchair users as they navigated air travel, providing an intimate look into the difficulties they face. Accompanied by a powerful digital advertising strategy, the campaign reached millions, amassing over 2 million video views and generating thousands of messages to Congress urging legislative change.\n\nThe results were transformative. In May, Congress passed a historic aviation bill that included comprehensive reforms to make air travel more accessible for individuals with disabilities—the most significant advancement in nearly 40 years. Fisher and Leclerc’s campaign played a crucial role in this achievement, amplifying public awareness and mobilizing support that directly influenced the passage of the bill.\n\nTheir efforts were recognized by the Public Affairs Council, which honored the campaign with its prestigious Innovation Award for exceptional advocacy work. Beyond the accolades, the campaign received widespread press coverage, further propelling the issue of disability access in air travel to the forefront of public and legislative discussions.\n\nFisher says it was “One of the proudest moments of my career. I remember that after attending my first Public Affairs Council conference over 10 years ago, I told my supervisor at that time that I wanted to work on a campaign that would win this award at some point in my career. To achieve that by leading this powerful campaign that will improve the life of so many people is awesome. Finally, to work with a friend and fellow Allegheny alumnus on this campaign for over a year was just icing on the cake. It was truly a partnership between Lynn and I, plus our two organizations, and having the campaign recognized by our peers this way is something I will never forget.”\n\nFisher and Leclerc’s shared history extends back to their days at Allegheny College, where they served as Student Government Senators. Sixteen years later, they find themselves influencing actual U.S. Senators on life-changing legislation. Reflecting on their journey from Allegheny’s campus to Capitol Hill, the pair noted how their Allegheny experience fostered the skills and passion they now bring to their professional advocacy roles.\n\n“Taking on leadership roles in student government (Senator and then Class Treasurer) and my sorority (Kappa Kappa Gamma’s Marshal), I learned to balance priorities, collaborate with others, and become increasingly comfortable with public speaking,” Leclerc says, adding that her major and minor combination also played a crucial role in her career trajectory.\n\n“My women’s studies minor, as well as the diverse curriculum of a liberal arts college, provided me with a deep perspective that spanned multiple subject areas and taught me the importance of never being one dimensional. Learning about different experiences and engaging your brain in different ways (like taking a random Calculus class) makes for a well-rounded professional that can pivot to whatever challenge comes your way,” Leclerc says.\n\nAs they continue to champion disability rights, Fisher and Leclerc are living proof of the far-reaching impact Allegheny alumni can have on the world.\n\n“The aspect of my career that I find the most rewarding is empowering individuals to use their voice in order to make change for them, their family members, or for people in their community,” Fisher says. “I know people are skeptical about whether their lawmakers want to hear from the people they represent, but…your voice matters, and when I see volunteers speaking up on issues they care about, it is truly amazing.”\n\nCheck out Leclerc and Fisher’s campaign video content here:",

Under the policies, students are prohibited from intentionally misgendering their classmates, defined as failing to use their preferred pronouns.\n\nBoth the policies and OLSD's student code of conduct also include \"transgender identity\" as a protected group, according to the lawsuit. This designation allows suspension and expulsion to be enforced in any cases of misgendering.\n\nPDE, with the of 17 states and 15 other advocacy groups, argued the policies promote compelled speech and violate students' religious rights. The parents' rights group also claimed the policies infringe upon families' rights to direct the upbringing of their children.\n\nHowever, U.S. Circuit Judge Jane Stranch ruled on July 29 that OLSD's policies are necessary to protect students from harassment. She concluded PDE would be unable to succeed on arguments that the policies compel speech in violation of the First Amendment.\n\n\"The District is entitled to recognize that speech about specific students' identities is particularly harmful and likely to disrupt the educational experience, and to regulate that speech accordingly,\" the ruling reads. \"PDE has failed to clearly show that, by doing so, the District engages in viewpoint discrimination.\"\n\nREAD MORE |\n\nFellow Circuit Judge Alice Batchelder argued in a lengthy dissent that public schools cannot force students \"to pretend [gender transition] is a real thing.\"\n\nAgree or disagree, but that is [PDE's] position,\" Batchelder wrote.\n\nOLSD said in a statement it is pleased with the ruling, noting the district remains committed to \"creating a safe and inclusive environment for all of our students.” Meanwhile, Nicole Neily, PDE president and founder, told Crisis in the Classroom (CITC) that while the group is \"disappointed,\" the ruling is \"not the end of the road.\"\n\n\"As Judge Batchelder persuasively explained in dissent: 'The First Amendment forbids the District from compelling students to use speech that conveys a message with which they disagree, namely that biology does not determine gender,'\" Neily said. \"PDE will seek further review of this decision.”\n\nEarlier this summer, the Ohio House passed a bill banning students from using bathrooms and locker rooms based on gender identity. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine previously expressed support for the legislation, telling reporters in June he would sign it \"as it stands now.\"\n\nThe bill currently sits with the Ohio Senate, which is not scheduled to meet again until November."
