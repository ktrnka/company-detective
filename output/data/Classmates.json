  "summary_markdown": "# About Classmates\n\nClassmates, founded on January 1, 1995, is a social networking platform based in Seattle, Washington. It primarily focuses on connecting individuals through shared educational experiences, particularly high school alumni. The platform serves over 70 million members, enabling users to find and reconnect with high school friends. Classmates also boasts the largest library of digitized yearbooks available online, with over 300,000 yearbooks, which helps members reconnect, reminisce, engage, and plan reunions [(Crunchbase, 2024)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/classmates-com).\n\nClassmates operates on a B2C model, generating revenue through advertising and premium membership subscriptions. The platform's primary customers are individuals looking to reconnect with former classmates and engage in alumni activities. The service is distributed online, accessible through its website and mobile applications.\n\nOver the years, Classmates has evolved from a small startup to a leading player in the social networking sector, particularly for educational alumni. The company has maintained its focus on community building and nostalgia, which resonates well with its user base.\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nSpecific details about the key personnel at Classmates were not available in the reviewed sources. However, the leadership's focus on community building and user engagement is evident through the platform's features and recent developments.\n\n# News\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n- **User Engagement**: Classmates has experienced a resurgence in user engagement, particularly during alumni events and reunions. For example, during the Alumni Weekend at Feinberg School of Medicine, over 450 alumni used the platform to reconnect and share experiences [(Rohman, Northwestern Feinberg, 2024-04-22)](https://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/2024/04/22/feinberg-classmates-reconnect-and-reminisce-at-alumni-weekend-2024/).\n\n- **Community Impact**: The platform has been instrumental in fostering community ties. A notable example is a mother and daughter duo at Illinois State University who reported that attending school together brought them closer, allowing them to support each other academically and socially [(Illinois State, 2024-05-07)](https://news.illinoisstate.edu/2024/05/redbird-legacy-being-classmates-brought-mother-and-daughter-closer-together/).\n\n## Partnerships and Collaborations\n\nClassmates has engaged in partnerships with educational institutions to enhance its offerings, focusing on facilitating alumni events and providing tools for schools to engage their former students effectively.\n\n## Fundraising and Financial Health\n\nClassmates raised $11 million in funding on January 7, 2000. While specific recent fundraising events were not detailed, the platform's growth in user engagement suggests a positive financial trajectory, potentially leading to increased advertising revenues and partnerships with educational institutions [(Crunchbase, 2024)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/classmates-com).\n\n## User Opinions and Feedback\n\nUser feedback on platforms like Reddit tends to be polarized. However, patterns indicate that users appreciate the nostalgic value of Classmates, with many expressing gratitude for the connections made through the platform. The emphasis on community and shared experiences resonates well with users, as seen in various alumni events [(Anderson, UW Bothell, 2024-06-21)](https://www.uwb.edu/news/2024/06/21/an-inspiration-to-classmates-and-community).\n\n## Challenges and Considerations\n\n- **Privacy Concerns**: Privacy remains a significant concern for users, and Classmates must ensure robust data protection measures to maintain user trust.\n  \n- **Competition**: The social networking space is highly competitive, with platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn also catering to alumni and professional networking. Classmates must continuously innovate to retain its user base.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nClassmates serves as a valuable platform for individuals seeking to reconnect with their educational past. With a focus on community engagement and user experience, the platform is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing trend of alumni networking. Continued partnerships with educational institutions and a commitment to user privacy will be crucial for its sustained success. For prospective candidates and investors, Classmates represents an opportunity to engage with a platform that fosters connections and has potential for growth in a niche market focused on educational alumni relations.",

And with a low price of 3 dollars, I’m like sure why not? Once you pay premium you see that it’s basically a scam as you’ve never heard of or can even see a picture of the alleged people who messaged you or came to your profile. I signed up and am class of ‘03, tell me why the website has me as class of ‘01? Because no one in my class that went to my school uses this website platform!!!

But with social media giants like Facebook and IG that are free, there really is no point in this app. Also, you can’t speak to a human or troubleshoot or get a refund. The app and website are trash and don’t work unless you pay. Then you pay and it works a little more but still doesn’t. It’s like a dating app. When you sign up for free then you get all these notifications like 5-10 times a day saying someone checked out your profile get premium to find out who! And with a low price of 3 dollars, I’m like sure why not? Once you pay premium you see that it’s basically a scam as you’ve never heard of or can even see a picture of the alleged people who messaged you or came to your profile. I signed up and am class of ‘03, tell me why the website has me as class of ‘01? Because no one in my class that went to my school uses this website platform!!!

But I didn't make the account and the password is something I've never used. with +16 score by [(fritocloud, Reddit, 2020-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/f51fx2/received_an_email_from_classmatescom_about/)\nClassmates.com... sounds familiar right? The kings of spam. They came out before Facebook and friendster but they went with the premium model and I had assumed they would have went out of business. I know they were sued at one point for deceptive advertising practices because they would email you saying that something was happening with your account but you had to pay to see what it was. And then when you paid, you would discover that nothing was happening with your account. Well, I just got an email from them welcoming me to the site. The thing is, I didn't make an account with them. I honestly can't remember if I ever made one with this email account (I know I signed up with them at some point but I'm pretty sure I was still using an AOL account at the time, lol. And that was many many years ago.) Anyways, I've gotten emails like this before where someone is using my email address with random info and I just assume it is some sort of scammer or spammer or bots or whatever. I usually go in and report or deactivate the account and no big deal. But this is the first time it has ever happened with my real first and last name. The other weird thing is they are using my full first name and for most things that I sign up for, I use a shortened version of my name. Which makes it less likely they got my name from one of those data leaked lists but not impossible. \n\nThere is a button to report the account for \"being made in error\" but that's the final twist to this. I really don't trust classmates.com and I really don't want to click that link in the email until I know what's going on. The way I see it, this could just be a diabolical plot on classmates.com's part, trying to get customers for their site or whatever.\n\nSo, I guess what I'm looking for is any advice on how to handle this. I should note that I do monitor my credit reports pretty thoroughly so I'm not too worried about any kind of identity theft issues with my SSN attached. Also, has anyone else had this happen to them? With this specific site or another site? Does anyone have any idea how this would happen? I very much doubt it is a real person who just coincidentally has my exact name and that they mistakenly put *my* email address (which is fairly unique and does not have my name in it at all) in when they were signing up.\n\n[Here is a screenshot with my info and the info from the fraudulent account omitted.](http://imgur.com/a/FwRkO4G)\n\nAlso, [here is some dogtax](http://imgur.com/gallery/TzWkUWO) (not mine found it on imgur while uploading my screenshot.

Everyone should freeze their account there (theworknumber\"dot\"com). I made a couple different posts on antiwork about it and they never got any traction. I tell everyone I know to freeze their accounts and few people take it seriously. The Work Number has so much information about your previous employment including salary, vacation and sick time taken, if you were enrolled in benefits or 401k, how much your deductions were, etc.\n\nImagine you are getting paid $80k at your current job and you apply for a job with an advertised salary of $95k. You try to be casual about it during the interview and say \"I'm looking for at least $95k. I make just a bit less than that at my current job, so with my experience and tenure I feel like $95k is fair compensation.\" They say \"Yep, sounds fair, that's right in line with our budget for this position.\" And then they pull your background check, including your job history through TWN, and find out you currently only make $80k, and lowball you at $84k.

My boss friend requested me on Facebook and ultimately used photos that were about 15 years old (college times) to embarrass me at a work dinner.

I’m currently taking Solidworks 1, and i’m having a hard time with a few things that I don’t think have a direct answer. \nFirst, I have a very hard time visualizing a 2D model of a 3D object. My brain just doesn’t make the connections and it’s really hindering my ability to do really anything. I know it may sound stupid. I’m wondering if anyone has any experience with what i’m dealing with and/or resources to help me understand how to visualize 2D models. I don’t know where to start since it’s such a broad question, so I understand if there’s some confusion. \n\nSecond, I am not technologically advanced. This, you can laugh at me for. I didn’t know how to use a hard drive properly until two weeks ago. I didn’t understand why you couldn’t install Solidworks on my Macbook until a month ago. I don’t know what the acronyms stand for in tech language. So you can understand my frustration with quite literally anything computer related. I feel so dense. What do I do to better understand my computer, the program, and general knowledge of the world of computers? I feel so stuck. \n\nI know this isn’t your typical Solidworks reddit post, but i’m very lost.

Like a toaster, maybe two slots on top, a handle, couple of buttons, maybe the feet on the bottom.\n\nThe trick is to avoid perspective, just concentrate on the 'flat' face that is towards you. Only edges get lines, IRL most things are rounded (fillets in SW), and a part of the skill is choosing what (lightly rounded) edges are important to convey the shape.\n\nYou should end up with 6 drawings, or 5 if you choose a toaster and didn't want crumbs all over your desk.\n\nSee how some drawings share elements? Like the handle and feet, whereas the slots and maybe buttons are only present on one drawing?\n\nNow make the mental connections between the drawings with shared elements and the object itself. Try drawing a perspective view now.\n\nI'm not sure if this is simple or not for you? If it is, thats all there is to it, except a whole bunch of tricky stuff, but that will come with practising on harder objects.\n\n- Toilet roll, key, apple, block of cheese that someone has cut on a compound angle.\n\n## Comment ID lp304ug with +3 score by [(Charitzo, Reddit, 2024-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidWorks/comments/1fq459w/solidworks_1_class_i_am_driving_my_classmates/lp304ug/) (in reply to ID 1fq459w):\nSo the process you're struggling with is called *defeaturing*. \n\nDefeaturing is where you look at geometry and break it down. Is this bit round? Is this bit flat? For basic class staff you're doing, 99% of your models will start with that: Is it round, or more flat?\n\nA big chunk of your features will be made with extrudes and revolves.\n\nExtrudes are taking a profile, and giving it thickness, making it 3D. \n\nRevolves are taking a profile, and spinning it around a rotation axis to make it 3D.\n\nBoth times we go 2D, then 3D. Before you do anything, mess around with boss extrudes, cut extrudes, boss revolves, and cut revolves. Look them up on YouTube if you need to. Get familiar with how they work. That will help a lot. You have zero chance of figuring out how to turn a real thing into a SOLIDWORKS model if you don't know how you'd actually model it. You need to understand your tools to understand how you can use them to achieve what you see with your eyes. \n\nWhen you look at a part, and you're starting out/it's basic, try and break it down into extrudes and revolves. Sometimes it can help to try to understand how it was made and try to mimic that. If a part is milled, it was once a block, and had stuff cut away from it. You can do the same thing - Make a block (boss extrudes), and cut stuff away from it (cut extrudes/revolves). If a part was turned, you know it's around an axis, so you do a revolved feature. \n\nHope that helps\n\n## Comment ID lp3rqy3 with +3 score by [(WolfInMen, Reddit, 2024-09-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidWorks/comments/1fq459w/solidworks_1_class_i_am_driving_my_classmates/lp3rqy3/) (in reply to ID 1fq459w):\nMy Solidworks professor gave us some resources for those who have a hard time with spacial visualization.

Just like when you get a new phone, the more you use it the better understanding you’ll have of how it works. \nFor SolidWorks you honestly don’t have to know too much about computers to operate it. \nWith the visualization of a 3D object from a 2D print, again it will take some practice. \nIn Solidworks you have parts, and assemblies. Think of a part as a single nut or bolt, while an assembly is the entire machine. \nStart thinking of the part or assembly you are working on in terms of planes. \nSolidworks gives you 3 default planes to work with while sketching, the front plane, right plane, and top plane. \nA typical American 2D print will show a picture of the front view in the lower left, a top view above that, and a right view to the right of the front view. Most prints will also include what is called an isometric view, which is just a corner view of the part or assembly. The isometric view gives you a better understanding of what the entire part or assembly looks like. That view will be located above the right view. \n\nI struggled very much in the beginning to understand what the part or assembly I’m working on is supposed to look like in 3D. \nBut here is a little trick I learned. \n\nDraw it to the best of your ability, and compare it with what you see on the print. Start with the front plane (the front view) and try your best to get all of the dimensions you match what it says on the print. Once you have that, move to the next plane, and so on and so forth. \n\nDon’t feel bad that you can’t visualize a 2D print as a 3D part in your head just by looking at it. It takes awhile to get there. \n\nI have used Solidworks every day for around 8 years now, and am happy to help you however I can. Feel free to shoot me any questions that you may have about computers, Solidworks, or engineering itself. \n\nYou’ll get super good at visualizing these prints in 3D in no time!

Real or imaginary, either work. Someone suggested a key as an object to work with. Take a key and put it in the bottom of a bowl, with you looking straight down into it. This is your \"Front\" view. Now move the key to the right, but keep it pressed to the inside of the bowl. When it gets to the lip of the bowl, this is now your \"Right\" side view. Move it back to the center, and now up to the top of the bowl. This is your \"Top\" view. This is called \"Third-angle projection\" and is most often used in US drawings. Across the pond you'll see \"First-angle projection\" which is the same concept, but using an upside-down bowl so Right/Left and Top/Bottom are inverted. Focus on Third-angle and use objects with a small number of edges to see what you can see when the object is rotated.\n\n## Comment ID lp4sn4u with +1 score by [(ab0ngcd, Reddit, 2024-09-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidWorks/comments/1fq459w/solidworks_1_class_i_am_driving_my_classmates/lp4sn4u/) (in reply to ID 1fq459w):\nI would add getting 5 lbs of clay and viewing a model from the 3 primary directions front side top, and carving into the clay.

But instead of using that power to toy with peoples lives for the sake of curiousity, Ralsei does his best to avoid that type of disaster. He knows that Kris has this power, and he knows the dangers of it. \n\nInstead of asking please never do a true reset like Flowey does at the end of credits. Ralsei is lying to Kris, specifically to fool us(the players) into thinking he is on our side, while he is slowly building a way to get rid of the Determination power from Kris. He is on the good side with good intentions, but he is not on OUR side. Even if it's a pacifist run, he still thinks it's too dangerous to have such power, so away it must go.\n\nI mentioned this theory on an r/ralsei poll [recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/ralsei/comments/pcxkrg/what_direction_would_you_like_ralsei_to_go_in/).\n\n### Comment ID hb4jkhd with +7 score by [(Grand_reaper658, Reddit, 2021-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb4jkhd/) (in reply to ID hb3mr3i):\ntemmie adventure?\n\n#### Comment ID hb5h2o5 with +2 score by [(KittyWarrior1, Reddit, 2021-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb5h2o5/) (in reply to ID hb4jkhd):\nyAYA!!!\n\n### Comment ID hb6pd5y with +7 score by [(M-striker, Reddit, 2021-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb6pd5y/) (in reply to ID hb3mr3i):\nThis….\n\nI want to believe is a metaphor, mostly in FARMING EXP: whenever kris/soul/frisk gets EXP his DETERMINATION increases, a power that gives him the ability to RESET, SAVE, ETC.

Jockington wears sunglasses; one of the purple items is ‘Cloudy Glasses,’ Temmie wears a brimmed cap; ‘Cowboy hat,’ Noelle is associated with christmas; you tie gift boxes up with Ribbons, and a toy knife is a potential gift. Snowy is very defensive about his comedy and potentially uses humor as a defense to begin with, and the green heart items are very defensive focused gear. Monster kid is pretty brave, considering he can stand up to Undyne, while he is wearing orange and I guess the glove is just kind of ironic. We don’t get a good look at Catti’s normal get-up, but being a waitress does require some level of grace a la ballet. As for Berdley, maybe it makes a bit more sense if you think of there being two red souls; Chara and Frisk, and thus they’re sort of rivals who aren’t that different in the end? I wouldn’t be surprised if Berdley turns out to have a similar situation to Kris, with Noelle being their only ‘friend.’\n\n#### Comment ID hb4e9o4 with +7 score by [(_AntiSocialMedia, Reddit, 2021-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb4e9o4/) (in reply to ID hb4crx4):\nThing is, so far, everyone in Deltarune has the same personality as their Undertale counterparts, different relationships and different jobs, yeah, but still the same personality.\n\nAnd, well, Snowy just isn't *that* nice in Undertale, he straight up calls Frisk unfunny if they tell a joke because he's jealous, and we know it's jealousy, and not Frisk just being unfunny, because even *Ice Cap* and *Jerry* think Frisk's jokes are funny.\n\n### Comment ID hbll4vn with +3 score by [(TheLegend2T, Reddit, 2021-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hbll4vn/) (in reply to ID hb4adde):\nII like how there's no debate Jockington is Perseverance\n\n## Comment ID hb3bz7g with +11 score by [(pascuales, Reddit, 2021-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb3bz7g/) (in reply to ID pfcg31):\nMakes sense considering that we have the main characters (Frisk; Kris, Susie and Ralsei) but in Undertale we wouldn't be able to win without the souls' help.

You should be taking advantage of the fact that you have someone to actually bounce ideas off of who can really relate and work with you through something in ways that others can’t.\n\n## Comment ID ll886ap with +82 score by [(Full_Occasion_1379, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContemporaryArt/comments/1f7lmwm/classmates_doing_the_same_mfa_thesis_topic_as_me/ll886ap/) (in reply to ID 1f7lmwm):\nI’m trying to make sure I understand the three of you have been diagnosed with OCD ? and you all feel that is the best thing to make art about?\n\n### Comment ID ll8unz4 with +39 score by [(paperplanes13, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContemporaryArt/comments/1f7lmwm/classmates_doing_the_same_mfa_thesis_topic_as_me/ll8unz4/) (in reply to ID ll886ap):\nNot just OCD, body focused / OCD\n\nSeems to be current trend, body / identity, body positivity, body / disability, etc. I have my suspicions that someone is doing a similar thesis in every MFA.\n\n#### Comment ID ll92vqv with +38 score by [(youngscum, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContemporaryArt/comments/1f7lmwm/classmates_doing_the_same_mfa_thesis_topic_as_me/ll92vqv/) (in reply to ID ll8unz4):\nOnly like 70% of all current MFA thesis' lol\n\n#### Comment ID llacky7 with +12 score by [(Full_Occasion_1379, Reddit, 2024-09-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContemporaryArt/comments/1f7lmwm/classmates_doing_the_same_mfa_thesis_topic_as_me/llacky7/) (in reply to ID ll8unz4):\nI don’t inherently find issue with people making work about the body / identity, I realize a lot of it is bad, but some of it is bound to be good.

And it's pretty common for a younger child with older siblings for a parent to invite the older sibs friends too so they have somebody to play with.  This is especially true when it's a house party and not some where your paying per kid. As they get older you'll have more independent parties.\n\nThe first couple of my youngest parties my oldest probably had more guests then the youngest. I'd often invite my mom friends with similar aged kids to the party. Low number parties tend to be more of a for the family/parent event until they're older anyways.\n\n## Comment ID l4lh1uy with +7 score by [(fabianx100, Reddit, 2024-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bluey/comments/1cuql3p/where_are_bingos_classmates_in_handstand/l4lh1uy/) (in reply to ID 1cuql3p):\nsimple: they didn't existed yet, shocking news but... not everything is set in stone in the show, things are made up as the seasons go by, when Handstand was made, Bingo classmates weren't created yet, it wasn't until much later when bingo classmates got a face a name and a voice.\n\n### Comment ID l4lif6m with +11 score by [(skyisboop, Reddit, 2024-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bluey/comments/1cuql3p/where_are_bingos_classmates_in_handstand/l4lif6m/) (in reply to ID l4lh1uy):\nDad Drop Off is before this episode.\n\n#### Comment ID l4lnaik with +3 score by [(keiraslame, Reddit, 2024-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bluey/comments/1cuql3p/where_are_bingos_classmates_in_handstand/l4lnaik/) (in reply to ID l4lif6m):\nwhich means it was probably wrote after this episode and released before. it’s not the end of the world\n\n### Comment ID l4p2oz6 with +3 score by [(Hudsucker20XX, Reddit, 2024-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bluey/comments/1cuql3p/where_are_bingos_classmates_in_handstand/l4p2oz6/) (in reply to ID l4lh1uy):\nBob Bilby\n\n#### Comment ID l4r4ssk with +2 score by [(fabianx100, Reddit, 2024-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bluey/comments/1cuql3p/where_are_bingos_classmates_in_handstand/l4r4ssk/) (in reply to ID l4p2oz6):\nwait... is being ages since i saw that episode... i think you're right, then i am wrong, thanks for the correction\n\n## Comment ID l4nso0y with +1 score by [(RegularAssInsurance, Reddit, 2024-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bluey/comments/1cuql3p/where_are_bingos_classmates_in_handstand/l4nso0y/) (in reply to ID 1cuql3p):\nI was just thinking this!!

Once you pay premium you see that it’s basically a scam as you’ve never heard of or can even see a picture of the alleged people who messaged you or came to your profile. I signed up and am class of ‘03, tell me why the website has me as class of ‘01? Because no one in my class that went to my school uses this website platform!!!

Edna Milanga ’21, MBA ’23, and her daughter attended Illinois State at the same time.\n\nAppears In Illinois State: Spring 2024\n\nOriginally from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Milanga started her academic journey at Heartland Community College, earning an associate degree and making her way through English as a second language classes before transferring to Illinois State to earn a bachelor’s degree in international business. Milanga later enrolled in Illinois State’s MBA program. Kazigwa wasn’t far behind, transferring to Illinois State for its computer networking and telecommunications program.\n\nTheir mother-daughter bond only grew when they became Illinois State classmates. Milanga and Kazigwa made time for each other during the week, meeting for meals and running errands together.\n\n“She was (on campus) early in the morning, and I would be there in the afternoon,” said Milanga. “Sometimes we would go for lunch in Watterson and have a good time. We went to the bookstore to order textbooks, and we went to a job fair together.”\n\nThey also used their experiences to help each other. Milanga guided her daughter through class scheduling. Kazigwa offered technology expertise in return.\n\n“We do homework together,” said Milanga. “She’s good with the computer, so when I’m stuck and frustrated, she helps me troubleshoot.”\n\nMilanga and Kazigwa said their unique experience brought them closer together.\n\n“We became closer friends.

It felt surreal.”\n\nRecipients of the Chancellor’s Medal are nominated by UW Bothell faculty, staff or fellow students, and those in this 20-year-old’s circle were unanimous: She’s been an inspiration to those around her through academic excellence, her resilience in the face of family hardship and her work as an influential student leader.\n\n“Puneet embodies the very essence of the Chancellor’s Medal — she’s an inspiration, overcoming profound personal challenges to not only succeed but also uplift those around her,” said Ahmed Mohamad, a senior majoring in Business Administration who served as ASUWB vice president.\n\nPushing for more\n\nBirk, who was a Running Start student, joined UW Bothell as a junior. She sought to challenge herself, taking a full load of classes and applying to become a legislative liaison for the Associated Students of the University of Washington Bothell. The student lobbyist position required her to temporarily relocate to Olympia and inspired her to declare her major in Law, Economics & Public Policy.\n\n“After working with the legislature and working with an entire team at a lobbying firm, I just fell in love with policy and the entire process of it,” said Birk. “Also, my dad is a businessman and I’ve seen him work with legal parties. It’s always interested me.”\n\nAside from her studies, Birk has held two part-time jobs as a student leader. In spring 2023, she became the youngest-ever elected president of the ASUWB. Meanwhile, she also served as president of the Washington Student Association, a student-led nonprofit organization that facilitates statewide student organizing and advocacy at colleges and universities.\n\n“For nearly two years, I’ve watched Puneet triumph as a student leader,” said Brittany Mayes, Birk’s adviser and associate director of Student Engagement & Activities. “As ASUWB liaison, she really trailblazed best lobby practices for her team members and advocated for her fellow students in Olympia. She took her role as president very seriously, too.”\n\nFostering student joy and inclusion\n\nBirk researched the feasibility of creating a “common hour” on campus when she served as ASUWB president. During this hour, the hope is that no classes will be scheduled so that students can have more time to engage with student clubs and enjoy their college experience. Over this summer quarter, the registrar’s office will begin analyzing how this blocked hour can be effectively implemented.\n\nTo deepen student representation and to establish more checks and balances for the ASUWB team, Birk helped build up a student senate after it was dismantled during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“With our growing population, I realized we were a team often trying our best to represent nearly 6,000 students. It’s just not an equitable representation of all the demographics. There are just not physically enough hands,” Birk said. “So, our vice president, our policy and personnel coordinator and I — each of us — did a lot of work on creating the bylaws and structure for recreating a student senate.”\n\nBirk also worked to help improve campus safety and expand food options in the new campus dining hall.\n\n“Her presidency was about creating a more engaged, inclusive and supportive campus community,” said Mohamad. “She wanted every student to feel seen, heard and valued.”\n\nMeeting hardship with grace\n\nEven as she’s triumphed as a student and a student leader, Birk has faced some personal challenges. When she started at UW Bothell, her mother was dealing with a series of critical health issues that forced Birk to take on more responsibilities at home.\n\n“The biggest challenge was navigating my mom’s mental health, especially because mental health is a completely different thing for her generation,” Birk said. “My caretaking involved trying to explain what these challenges can look like, such as what anxiety truly is. So, I was not only trying to make sure that everybody was on the same page of how we could help mom get better but also ensuring that we were actively helping her to get better.”\n\nThen, in April 2023, Birk lost her “Big Dad,” her beloved grandfather who was a fixture of their family and of their larger Sikh and Punjabi communities.\n\n“He practically raised us. I feel losing him really opened my eyes to grief, and it also brought me closer to my religion” she said. “But it was a lot, and as a student, the homework never stops, so I really had to push through.”\n\nBirk has not only overcome, but she has excelled. She made the dean’s list this year and has continued to stay involved with numerous school clubs and mentor fellow ASUWB members.\n\n“The loss she endured could have dimmed any spirit, but Puneet’s resolve only grew stronger,” said Mohamad.\n\nHer presidency was about creating a more engaged, inclusive and supportive campus community. She wanted every student to feel seen, heard and valued.\n\nAhmed Mohamad, senior, Business Adminstration\n\nA bright future\n\nBirk graduated in June with her bachelor’s degree, and she is looking forward to law school. She’s currently studying for the Law School Admission Test, which she will take later this year. She hopes to attend the University of California, Los Angeles, or University of California, Berkeley, (or perhaps an Ivy League school) and eventually practice corporate law.\n\nDuring UW Bothell’s Commencement ceremony at T-Mobile Park, Birk was recognized by Chancellor Esterberg as recipient of the 2024 Chancellor’s Medal and, as ASUWB president, gave her final speech to her classmates.\n\nHer remarks centered around her beloved grandpa’s mantra, “kush roh.” This means “stay happy,” in Punjabi, Birk explained. “It’s a reminder to embrace joy in every moment, regardless of life’s challenges and uncertainties.”\n\nWith her enthusiastic demeanor, compassionate leadership, enduring work ethic and deep devotion to family, Birk beautifully embodies her grandfather’s mantra — and the ethos behind one of UW Bothell’s most prestigious student awards.",

After graduating from medical school, Dedo’s husband practiced spinal orthopedic surgery in Florida and California until his passing in 2021.\n\n“I met him when he was a dashing young intern in white. We got married when he was a second-year resident, and then he did a fellowship at Children’s, and then our first baby was born at Wesley, and through the years, Dick would say to anyone who would sit and listen that Northwestern was responsible for his success in life,” Dedo said.\n\nIn 2013, Dedo and his classmates Howard Schuele, ’64 MD, ’71 GME, Tim Sullivan, ’64 MD, and Howard Kidd, ’64 MD, established Feinberg’s Class of 1964 Scholarship, which continues to support medical students at Feinberg.\n\n“I’m going to be meeting up with two of our friends. We had a posse of five couples. Every year, whether it was a significant reunion year or not, that was our excuse to get together. The guys were fast friends in the school and the wives got to know each other through the reunion. So, the reunion was always important to us,” Dedo said.\n\nMore than 450 alumni and guests returned to Feinberg on April 18, 19 and 20 to reconnect with former classmates, learn about the medical school’s latest developments and achievements, and reminisce about their medical school experiences at this year’s Alumni Weekend celebration.\n\nWilliam Iverson, ‘74 MD, a member of Feinberg’s Half Century Club, which includes alumni who have been graduates of Feinberg for 50 years or more, said he was thrilled reconnect with his classmates and be able to return to Feinberg’s campus for the first time since he graduated medical school.\n\n“To go to an institution where they thought we were something special and that we were going to do something outstanding in our lifetime… they were right. I’ve been in practice for 46 years now, and I know how I’ve impacted my patients’ lives. Northwestern was the start of it all,” Iverson said.\n\nDuring the weekend-long celebration, alumni attended social and educational events across Feinberg’s campus, including a concert by the Northwestern Medical Orchestra, walking tours of nearby Chicago attractions, and tours of campus facilities, including the Anatomy Lab, the Northwestern Simulation Lab, and the Louis A. Simpson and Kimberly K. Querrey Biomedical Research Center.\n\nThe weekend also featured educational forums led by Feinberg faculty about the prevention and treatment of heart failure with artificial intelligence, navigating equity and inclusion in medical education, and the impact of gun violence on health outcomes and the importance of implementing public health policies.\n\nAlumni and current students also had the chance to connect and chat during a mentoring lunch organized by medical specialty.\n\n“I really enjoyed talking with students about pediatrics. One student I spoke to the most was a first year, and we talked about pediatrics and the different types of practices and what he’s heard about the grind of primary care and dispelling myths about it,” said Michael Salinsky, ‘94 MD, who attended the mentoring lunch and celebrated his 30th class reunion this year.\n\nIn the afternoon, alumnae gathered for the annual Women in Medicine Tea at Chicago’s historic Drake Hotel, which featured a candid panel discussion from alumnae who spoke about their challenges and success during their career, achieving work-life balance and leadership. The discussion was moderated by Kavitha Gandhi, ‘98 MD, clinical instructor of Dermatology and co-chair of Feinberg’s Women in Medicine committee.\n\n“The more I dive into my research, I realize the sign of an effective and efficient leader is cultivating new leaders, so that you have that succession, so that you have accountability, so that you have sustainability…. So, I leave you this: be the leader that you wish you had, especially when it comes to transforming the actions and minds of others,” said Dawn Brown, ‘99 MPT, DPT, EdD, assistant professor of Physical Therapy and Human Movement Sciences and a panelist at this year’s Women in Medicine tea.\n\nThe day concluded with remarks from Eric G. Neilson, MD, vice president for Medical Affairs and Lewis Landsberg Dean, who shared with alumni and guests an overview of the state of the medical school during “Conversations with the Dean.”\n\n“I’m delighted to give our alumni an update on what’s happening and where things are heading,” Neilson said. “Feinberg is almost a billion-dollar enterprise, with a research portfolio that’s now over 700 million dollars.”\n\nNeilson updated alumni on the medical school’s recent achievements, including Feinberg’s involvement in the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago, new academic leadership appointments across the medical school, and diversity and inclusion programming and events.\n\nOn Friday evening, attendees gathered for an all-alumni reception and dinner, which included a salute to the milestone reunion classes, ranging from the classes of 1959 to 2019.\n\nDuring the dinner, this year’s Distinguished Alumni Award was presented to Thomas Quinn, ‘74 MD, professor of Medicine and of Pathology at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health. Quinn also celebrated his 50th class reunion at this year’s Alumni Weekend.\n\n“I am both honored and humbled at the same time to receive this award,” Quinn said. “This means so much to me to be recognized by the leadership of Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine. There are so many outstanding scholars and graduates of the school that could be equally recognized and to be this year’s recipient is truly one of the highest honors for me. My four years of medical school shaped me as a clinician and researcher, and for that I am eternally grateful to my teachers, the faculty and the leadership at Feinberg.”\n\nQuinn is a renowned international leader in HIV, STD and infectious diseases research, and has authored more than 900 peer-reviewed publications. He is scientist emeritus at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and is an advisor on HIV and STDs to the World Health Organization, the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (PEPFAR), UNAIDS, and the FDA.\n\n“Receiving this award was so special in itself, but to be able to share it with my class and to spend the weekend events with my former classmates was the most rewarding and emotional event for me, as I know it was for all of us,” Quinn said.",

They’re accused of using artificial intelligence to create nude photos of multiple classmates.\n\nUsing AI to produce child sexual abuse material is illegal.\n\nThe Homer Police Department’s Lt. Ryan Browning says the investigation began when one girl reported that her classmates created nude photographs of her – but now the case involves many more victims.\n\n“We started our investigation, started getting some of the digital devices, and quickly realized that it was spiraling (to) more than just one young lady,” he said, “I think we’re up to 10 or 11 victims right now that this happened to. That the kids were circulating these photos. So not just the two boys, but they would send it to other classmates, and the other classmates were circulating it as well.”\n\nRELATED: Many Alaskans were victims of internet crime last year. AI could make things worse.\n\nNow, the case is in the hands of the state Division of Juvenile Justice. A division spokesperson said in an email they will review the case with the District Attorney’s office “for the appropriate legal response”.\n\nUnder Alaska law, the division can’t provide more information about the minors.\n\nIn response to the incident, Browning held a presentation earlier on how to navigate parenting and social media. He’s held this presentation locally and across the state.\n\nBrowning says charges associated with these incidents generally involve multiple felonies related to the production of child sex abuse material, including unlawful exploitation of a minor, and possessing and distributing the material.\n\nThese incidents are part of a growing wave of minors creating fake nudes of their peers. In the past year, these incidents have been reported across the country, including New Jersey and California.",
      "# [Former Classmates Turn Compassion into Action](https://hsdm.harvard.edu/news/former-classmates-turn-compassion-action)\n“It was fate that we met that day,” said Shahid Aziz, DMD96, of his first encounter with Jose Marchena during a class photo. “I completed my undergrad in three years, instead of the typical four. If it wasn’t for that we never would have met on those front steps of Harvard School of Dental Medicine (HSDM). I remember Jose was standing right in front of me when that photo was taken.”\n\nThat fateful moment for Aziz and classmate Jose Marchena, DMD96, MD98, sparked a brotherhood that has lasted 33 years. As predoctoral students, the two spent almost every day together taking the same classes and attending the same labs with their peers.\n\nThe Class of 1996 finished their degrees in five years, marking the last class to do so before returning to a four-year predoctoral program. The fifth year of the program was devoted to either conducting research, managing a public health project, or beginning specialty training.\n\n“My experience at HSDM was like no other. The faculty members were faithfully dedicated to the students, and they took a great deal of time and effort to foster a spirit of excellence among all of us,” said Marchena. “That close relationship allowed the faculty to closely monitor our progress and shape us into the type of practitioners we are today.”\n\nBoth Aziz and Marchena went on to pursue oral and maxillofacial surgery residencies after graduating from HSDM. Now, they have well-established careers in surgery and academic medicine, crediting their mentors at HSDM for opening the door into the world of academic oral surgery.\n\n“Having role models, such as Dean Donoff, Dr. Leonard Kaban, and Dr. Guralnick, as a dental student really inspired me to go into academia instead of private practice,” said Aziz. “I had a lot of great instructors, many of whom encouraged me to train in oral and maxillofacial surgery.”\n\nMarchena serves as an associate professor in the Bernard and Gloria Pepper Katz Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Dentistry. Aziz is the division director of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and professor of Otolaryngology at Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine.\n\nIn 2006, Aziz started the nonprofit organization, Smile Bangladesh—an organization dedicated to providing care to children and adults in Bangladesh with facial cleft deformities. The organization provides free treatment with the help of surgeons and nurses who volunteer their time and expertise.\n\n“My father was from Bangladesh. Before he passed away, he asked me to never forget where I came from and always try to help those less fortunate,” said Aziz. “During my residency with Dr. Steve Roser, DMD68, I had the chance to travel on surgical missions to South America, where he taught me how to run a humanitarian mission. In 2006, I had my first mission to Bangladesh and Smile Bangladesh was born!”\n\nTo date, the organization has treated nearly 2,000 children with cleft lip and palate deformities. After running Smile Bangladesh on his own for a few years, Aziz was looking for additional help to grow the organization. In 2011, he recruited Marchena to become vice president of Smile Bangladesh to expand upon the organization’s vision and effort. The same year Marchena went on his first mission trip.\n\n“That first trip is one I’ll never forget,” Marchena said. “I realized how important patient care really is. It’s just you and the patient. I’ll never forget the look on the parents’ faces after their child has been taken care of.”\n\nNow in its eighteenth year, they don’t plan to slow down anytime soon. Twice a year the team travels to Bangladesh to provide free cleft lip and palate repairs to children in need. Many of the surgeons and residents who join are HSDM graduates, including Gregory Borah, DMD76, MD76, PD81, who also serves on the board of Smile Bangladesh.\n\n“My experience with Smile Bangladesh continuously reminds me of the primary purpose of choosing a healthcare profession. It brings like-minded people together and touches the lives of doctors, residents, students, and patients alike,” said Marchena.\n\nThere is also an educational component to the organization. Aziz and Marchena have traveled all over the globe, lecturing on a wide range of oral surgery topics. Their ongoing commitment to making a difference in the lives of their patients has led the pair to receive recognition for their work with the organization. In 2017, Aziz received the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) Humanitarian Award. Marchena was honored with the same award in 2023.\n\nAziz hopes that in the future, they can develop a devoted team and center in Bangladesh to provide educational training for local surgeons and alleviate the wait time for patients needing critical care.\n\n“The whole organization is a labor of love. I never would have predicted that first interaction on the steps would lead me, lead us, to the path we are on today,” said Aziz. “I’m so thankful to HSDM for bringing us together.”",
      "# [Friends, classmates remember student found slain at UGA as neighbors describe suspect’s arrest by Marissa Parra, Rebecca Cohen on 2024-02-25](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/friends-classmates-remember-student-found-slain-uga-neighbors-describe-rcna140363)\nATHENS, Georgia — Days after Laken Hope Riley was found dead on the University of Georgia campus, friends and classmates are remembering the 22-year-old as a kind young woman who “brought so many people together.”\n\nBianca Tiller, who roomed with Riley during their freshman year at UGA, said, “She was the sweetest, most pure-hearted young woman” who “brought so many people together and developed so many friendships.”\n\n“I came into UGA knowing less than a handful of people and she brought me into her friend group, never let me feel left out,” Tiller said about Riley. “She made everyone smile and and is such a kind soul.”\n\n“The great thing about Laken, everyone she met could instantly tell what a great heart she was,” Tiller added.\n\nTiller said her former roommate loved to run and kept track of her runs on her Apple Watch. Riley always shared her phone’s location with her friends, Tiller said.\n\nRiley’s body was found with “visible injuries” in a forested area behind Lake Herrick on Thursday, police have said. She had gone out for a jog at the Intramural Fields that morning, and when she didn’t return hours later, her friend called the police.\n\nRiley died of blunt force trauma.\n\nThe suspect, identified as Jose Antonio Ibarra, 26, of Athens, has been charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, police said Friday.\n\nThere was no indication that Ibarra and Riley knew each other, according to UGA Police Chief Jeff Clark, who called it a “crime of opportunity” and said there was no further threat to the campus. Ibarra was being held in the Clarke County Jail.\n\nRoommates, friends remember Riley as selfless, loving\n\nLilly Steiner, another friend from UGA, thanked Riley in a tribute posted Saturday on Instagram for “helping me find the joy in life.”\n\n“You put everyone before yourself everyday, and you loved like no one else,” Sofia Magana, one of Riley’s roommates at UGA, said on Instagram.\n\n“You were supposed to be by my side on my wedding day, you were supposed to be with us on graduation ... but most importantly you were supposed to be here with us,” Magana wrote.\n\nSophia Palomino said in a tribute post that Riley “taught me so many lessons about life, friendship & sisterhood” and that “her love has changed me for the better.” She added that she admired how Riley was always putting others before herself.\n\nConnolly Huth, who also lived with Riley, recalled their shared memories and said she and Riley were supposed to run their first marathon together.\n\n“I will run that 26.2 in your honor and let everyone know of the perfect, beautiful, hilarious, smart, kind, and driven human that Laken Riley was,” Huth wrote in an Instagram post.\n\nRiley attended the University of Georgia through the spring 2023 semester and was studying at nearby Augusta University College of Nursing at the time of her death. In a statement, the school called her “a promising future nurse” who made the dean’s list in the fall.\n\nA GoFundMe page was set up in Riley’s honor to help her family with funeral costs and with hopes of starting a scholarship in her name.\n\nCommunity reeling from Riley’s death\n\nOn Saturday, security waited outside the Alpha Chi Omega sorority house, where Riley was still an active member, as students with flowers in their hands rushed to and from their cars, heads down and focused, wearing a grim look.\n\nThe tension on the campus Saturday was palpable.\n\nOne student clutched pepper spray as she crossed the street. She said up until this week, it was gathering dust in her car.\n\nA small memorial grew by Lake Herrick, where Riley was last seen alive, as well as by the famed UGA arch. Students who never met Riley gave it a somber acknowledgement as they walked past.\n\n“It’s really upsetting. I know that I love to run, and so to know that that could’ve been me, that could’ve been anyone on this campus, it’s just terrible. It could be anybody,” UGA student Millicent Dye said.\n\nA quiet fear also lurks just off campus among a pocket of Venezuelans living in Athens.\n\nFrom outside Andreina Rivas’ apartment in the same community as Ibarra, she described in Spanish the shock and fear of seeing police swarming her street, only to find out it was because the suspect, whom she’d never met, was living just down the road from her.\n\nRivas threw her hands up in frustration, re-enacting the moment she said she found out the suspect’s family was Venezuelan, like her.\n\nRivas said that in a group chat with other Venezuelans, some expressed fears that locals would “come after Venezuelans.”\n\nSuspect’s brother also facing legal trouble\n\nThe suspect’s brother, Diego Ibarra, 29, was also taken into custody Friday and federally charged with possessing a fraudulent green card, according to a release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Georgia.\n\nDiego Ibarra is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela, the U.S. attorney’s office said. He was also being held in the Clarke County Jail. It was not immediately clear if he had retained legal representation.\n\nHe was approached by police Friday because he matched the description of the suspect in the investigation into Riley’s death, the U.S. attorney’s office said. He allegedly showed officers his fake green card as a form of identification.\n\nPolice determined the card to be fraudulent and charged Diego Ibarra. He is being held in state custody and faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if convicted, according to the U.S. attorney’s office.\n\nA spokesperson for UGA said he was fired from his position at the university after they learned of the alleged fake green card.\n\n“Diego Ibarra presented a fake green card to the hiring unit to begin a temporary position as a dishwasher in Bolton Dining Hall at the University of Georgia on Feb. 6, 2024,” the spokesperson said. “He subsequently failed to submit further documentation required to keep the job and was never paid by the University.”\n\nHe has been arrested three times on nonviolent offenses since he came to the U.S., according to the U.S. attorney’s office.\n\nJose Ibarra’s arrest has started a political firestorm within the conservative movement regarding immigration and border policy.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp demanded answers from President Joe Biden on Ibarra’s immigration status and asylum claims by his brother.\n\n“Laken Riley’s tragic death struck the hearts of Georgians everywhere and has rightfully sparked national outrage,” Kemp said in a statement. “As I have said many times before: every state is now a border state because of Joe Biden’s inaction, and today I am again demanding answers and information from the Biden Administration that will help us protect our citizens when the federal government will not.”\n\nJose Ibarra is not a U.S. citizen, police said. His immigration status was not clear. A public defender who represented Ibarra at a bond hearing did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Sunday.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Ibarra was arrested by Customs and Border Protection on Sept. 8, 2022, after unlawfully entering the country near El Paso, Texas.\n\nHe was paroled and released for further processing, but was arrested on Sept. 14, 2023, by the New York Police Department and charged with “acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation,” ICE said.\n\nThe NYPD released Ibarra before ICE could issue a detainer — a request that a law enforcement agency keep hold of non-citizens who have been arrested on criminal charges and are eligible for deportation so that ICE can take them into custody — the immigration agency said.\n\nICE said it issued a detainer for Ibarra following his arrest Friday.\n\nSuspect’s neighbors recall police swarming complex\n\nJennifer Slonaker and Ricky Carter, husband and wife, live in the Argo Apartment Community in Athens in one of the units above where Ibarra was living.\n\n“We’d see him out and about. There wasn’t a lot of conversation because we think he spoke Spanish. Nothing out of the ordinary. They seemed normal enough, everyone in that apartment. Three men and a woman,” Slonaker said.\n\nAround noon Friday, the couple said they saw police swarm the complex.\n\n“There wasn’t an inch of this place that didn’t have a cop on it. … They knocked and search every door in this complex, but they started with the one downstairs. They knew what and who they were looking for,” Slonaker said.\n\nThe couple described seeing Ibarra walk away in handcuffs. He didn’t look around, remained quiet and focused ahead of him, they said. His brother Diego followed in handcuffs shortly thereafter.\n\nSlonaker and her husband spoke to NBC News from outside their apartment, sharing details in between drags on a cigarette. Their regular smoke breaks are, in part, why they noticed the forensics team downstairs didn’t leave Ibarra’s apartment until 2:30 Saturday morning.\n\nCarter looked around, almost hesitating to keep his voice from traveling downstairs for a moment.\n\n“Makes me feel some type of way you can be amongst a killer and not even know it,” he said.\n\nMarissa Parra reported from Athens, Georgia, and Rebecca Cohen from New York City.",

Under the policies, students are prohibited from intentionally misgendering their classmates, defined as failing to use their preferred pronouns.\n\nBoth the policies and OLSD's student code of conduct also include \"transgender identity\" as a protected group, according to the lawsuit. This designation allows suspension and expulsion to be enforced in any cases of misgendering.\n\nPDE, with the of 17 states and 15 other advocacy groups, argued the policies promote compelled speech and violate students' religious rights. The parents' rights group also claimed the policies infringe upon families' rights to direct the upbringing of their children.\n\nHowever, U.S. Circuit Judge Jane Stranch ruled on July 29 that OLSD's policies are necessary to protect students from harassment. She concluded PDE would be unable to succeed on arguments that the policies compel speech in violation of the First Amendment.\n\n\"The District is entitled to recognize that speech about specific students' identities is particularly harmful and likely to disrupt the educational experience, and to regulate that speech accordingly,\" the ruling reads. \"PDE has failed to clearly show that, by doing so, the District engages in viewpoint discrimination.\"\n\nREAD MORE |\n\nFellow Circuit Judge Alice Batchelder argued in a lengthy dissent that public schools cannot force students \"to pretend [gender transition] is a real thing.\"\n\nAgree or disagree, but that is [PDE's] position,\" Batchelder wrote.\n\nOLSD said in a statement it is pleased with the ruling, noting the district remains committed to \"creating a safe and inclusive environment for all of our students.” Meanwhile, Nicole Neily, PDE president and founder, told Crisis in the Classroom (CITC) that while the group is \"disappointed,\" the ruling is \"not the end of the road.\"\n\n\"As Judge Batchelder persuasively explained in dissent: 'The First Amendment forbids the District from compelling students to use speech that conveys a message with which they disagree, namely that biology does not determine gender,'\" Neily said. \"PDE will seek further review of this decision.”\n\nEarlier this summer, the Ohio House passed a bill banning students from using bathrooms and locker rooms based on gender identity. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine previously expressed support for the legislation, telling reporters in June he would sign it \"as it stands now.\"\n\nThe bill currently sits with the Ohio Senate, which is not scheduled to meet again until November.",

As a first-generation American, she has been afforded many \"firsts\" that her family hasn't experienced.\n\nFor her, the opportunity to vote is monumental.\n\nIn the days leading up to election day, Alfonso is not only preparing to vote, but she's also helping her classmates by explaining the amendments on the ballot.\n\n\"I wanted to make it as easy as possible for them to understand so they could go out and vote and feel prepared when they do so,\" she said.\n\nFor Alfonso, many issues are top of mind, such as immigration, healthcare, and education.\n\n\"There is a candidate that has my vote in mind, and I'm leaning more toward them because I feel like they're going to be the one that most represents what I want to see not just for myself, but for other people, other first-generation Americans,\" said Alfonso.\n\nAbby voted early, and CBS News Miami followed her through the process as she walked through Miami Dade College, where she cast her ballot.\n\n\"A little nervous, especially since this is such a big election and there are so many things going on around it, but I'm looking forward to seeing the outcome,\" Abby recounted her experience of voting for the first time.\n\nWhen you vote early, the Miami-Dade Board of Elections states it's no different than casting your vote on election day. Once a ballot is completed by a registered voter, it's fed into a machine.\n\n\"So, it's sort of a hybrid, right? The ballot is being read right there. The results are being accumulated in that machine, and then on election night, all of the results from those machines are uploaded for the public to see,\" said Miami Dade Board of Elections Supervisor Christina White.\n\nAbby hopes her vote helps prevent tragedies, provide opportunities, and improve the country.\n\n\"These things impact my life because I've seen it myself when family members have come to the U.S. from Cuba and struggled to find a good job, waiting months and months for things like getting a job, buying a house, or purchasing a car things that we, living in the United States, need to succeed,\" she said.\n\nUp next, she plans to go to college and study pre-law, something she's explored while on her high school debate team.",
      "# [Why Thomas Matthew Crooks tried to assassinate Donald Trump is a mystery to investigators and his ex-classmates by Ryan W. Briggs, Max Marin, Ellie Rushing on 2024-07-14](https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania/thomas-matthew-crooks-trump-shooting-bethel-park-20240714.html)\nBETHEL PARK, Pa. — In the sea of caps and gowns, Thomas Matthew Crooks hardly stood out.\n\nFew people clapped when his name was called. A YouTube video of his graduation two years ago from Bethel Park High School shows a slender and bespectacled student receiving his diploma with a soft smile.\n\nBut the class of 2022 awoke Sunday to learn that the 20-year-old Allegheny County man was notorious, the shooter in the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump during a rally that left an ex-firefighter, Corey Comperatore, dead and two other attendees wounded.\n\nU.S. Secret Service counter-snipers killed Crooks moments after he opened fire on the Saturday night rally from a nearby rooftop. The FBI said Sunday they believed he acted alone. He had not been on the bureau’s radar.\n\n» READ MORE: FBI probing motives, background of Thomas Matthew Crooks, the Western Pa. gunman behind Donald Trump assassination attempt\n\nCrooks’ actions shocked residents in his hometown, sparked countless conspiracy theories online, and prompted investigators to begin combing through every aspect of his life, looking for motive.\n\nThe mystery has been fueled by a near-total absence of Crooks’ social media postings, political writings, or other digital fingerprints.\n\nSeveral former classmates appeared on national television Sunday, quickly casting Crooks as a stereotypical loner who was bullied heavily during his time at Bethel Park. One of them, Jason Kohler, told reporters Sunday that students tormented Crooks “almost every day” and that he often wore “hunting” outfits to class.\n\n“He was just an outcast,” Kohler said, “and you know how kids are nowadays.”\n\nYet, two former students interviewed by The Inquirer disputed the characterization.\n\nThey did not recall specific incidents of violence or other antagonism involving their now-infamous classmate in the community they described as generally tight-knit.\n\nMark Sigafoos remembered Crooks as the quiet but friendly kid he shared two classes with at Bethel Park.\n\n“He was very kind,” Sigafoos said Sunday, by phone. “He was a nerdy kid, but I don’t think he was as harshly bullied as some people are saying. He never wore trench coats or anything of the sort to school.”\n\nA Tribune-Review article from Bethel Park’s June 2022 graduation credited Crooks with earning an academic award, for math and science. And Sigafoos said that when he didn’t understand the course material, Crooks was someone he turned to for help.\n\nThe thought that the mild-mannered student would try to kill former President Trump was difficult to process.\n\n“I feel like this is one of those things that you wouldn’t expect from him,” Sigafoos said. “No one that I know said they ever found him to be a creepy, loner kind of guy.”\n\n» READ MORE: Conspiracy theories spread wildly online after Trump shooting\n\nFBI investigators found materials for two explosive devices in Crooks’ car, according to the New York Times. Police on Sunday restricted public access to the gunman’s home in Bethel Park, nestled in a middle-class suburb eight miles south of Pittsburgh.\n\nThe slight traces of public information Crooks left behind leave few clues about his political ideology.\n\nFederal campaign finance records show he made a $15 donation to progressive political action committee in 2021 after President Joe Biden’s election, but later registered as a Republican, according to Pennsylvania voter data. His father was a registered Libertarian, his mother a Democrat.\n\nCrooks’ body was found on the rooftop of an agricultural tool manufacturing plant a few hundred feet from the rally with an AR-style semiautomatic rifle — legally purchased by his father. The shooter was wearing a T-shirt promoting “The Demolition Ranch,” a YouTube channel for gun enthusiasts.\n\n» READ MORE: What we know about the deadly shooting at the Trump rally in Butler, Pa.\n\nIf Crooks maintained any personal social media presence, it went largely undetected on Sunday. Discord, an instant messaging platform mainly used by video gamers, released a statement acknowledging Crooks held a “rarely utilized” account that contained no information relevant to the shooting.\n\nSigafoos did not recall Crooks making political overtures in class, but rather as someone interested in how government works, and “not trying to insert his own beliefs into it.”\n\nAnother former classmate did not share this view.\n\nMax R. Smith recalled taking an American history course with Crooks as a sophomore. He did recall Crooks making political statements — but they shed no light on his actions Saturday.\n\n“He definitely was conservative,” he said. “It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate.”\n\nSmith recalled a mock debate in which their history professor posed government policy questions and asked students to stand on one side of the classroom or the other to signal their support or opposition for a given proposal.\n\n“The majority of the class were on the liberal side, but Tom, no matter what, always stood his ground on the conservative side,” Smith said. “That’s still the picture I have of him. Just standing alone on one side while the rest of the class was on the other.”\n\nThe former classmate also recalled Crooks as generally kind and intelligent, if reserved.\n\n“Everybody is in shock,” Smith said. “He was so quiet, I wouldn’t imagine him doing that. But I guess that was the same deal with Columbine.”\n\n“Shocked would be an understatement,” Sigafoos added. “None of my friends can fathom that a dude we knew would try and kill Trump.”\n\n» READ MORE: Corey Comperatore identified as man killed in Trump rally shooting\n\nBethel Park High School said it would comply with investigators. On Sunday, the sprawling school campus was quiet, emptied for the summer, save for a police car parked in front of the main building.\n\nCrooks’ career arc since high school is also not entirely clear. Crooks listed himself as unemployed in 2020, but most recently worked as a dietary aide at Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, a state-licensed transitional care facility.\n\nAnd there too, his employer saw no cause for concern. Marcie Grimm, the center’s administrator, said in a statement Sunday that the facility was complying with federal investigators.\n\n“We are shocked and saddened to learn of his involvement as Thomas Matthew Crooks performed his job without concern and his background check was clean,” Grimm said.\n\n» READ MORE: GOP delegates from Pa. prepare to give Trump a ‘hero’s welcome’ in Milwaukee\n\nHe graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County two months ago, earning an associate degree in engineering science, school officials said in a statement to the New York Times, saying they were “shocked and saddened by the horrific turn of events.”\n\nRelatives of Crooks could not be immediately reached.\n\nBy Sunday afternoon, police had cordoned off surrounding roads that lead to the home of Crooks’ parents in the Hill Crest neighborhood of Bethel Park, with closed road signs dotting the street and a traffic attendant waving cars to a detour. The residence was surrounded by law enforcement and federal agents.\n\nAbout 45 minutes south of Butler, at the home of one of his relatives in the town of Allison Park, no one answered the door, adorned with a pastel-colored wreath.",
      "# [East Jerusalem teen attempts to recruit classmates to ISIS by JERUSALEM POST STAFF on 2024-08-22](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-815871)\nAn East Jerusalem 16-year-old high school student attempted to recruit his classmates to join ISIS and was arrested by the Israel Police, the Shin Bet and the Israel Police reported Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe Jerusalem District Central Unit began investigating the student in late July, following suspicions that a student at a school in Beit Hanina was involved in terrorist activities.\n\nThe suspect was originally from the north of Israel and moved to live with his parents in the French Hill neighborhood in Jerusalem. He was studying physics and electronics at school.\n\nThe investigation by the Jerusalem Central Unit revealed that the suspect attempted to spread Islamic State ideology among his classmates at the school. His social media alias was named after one of the former leaders of the terrorist organization.\n\nIn his phone, police discovered ISIS content, including a video on how to make explosive devices. They also found files, which included formulas for making explosive devices and instructions on purchasing materials for those explosives.\n\nPolice also found files containing religious Islamic laws related to suicide bombings, killing innocent people, and other similar topics.\n\nAccording to classmate testimonies provided to the police, the teenager repeatedly attempted to recruit them to ISIS and threatened those who refused, saying that ISIS terrorists would kill them one day. He also expressed a desire to carry out a terror attack, either with a car bomb or using explosives, and to die as a \"Khalifa.\"\n\nSome teachers knew about his activities\n\nFurthermore, some teachers knew about his activities and nicknamed him “Da’doosh.” The school’s report on the topic will be sent to the Education Ministry.\n\nThe Police suspect that the student distributed ISIS terrorist content among students, praised and glorified ISIS, its operatives, and its ideology, identified himself as a member and enthusiastic supporter, frequently discussed attacks, and expressed his desire to go to Iraq and join ISIS’s ranks.\n\nHis detention was extended, and recently, a prosecutor's statement has been filed against him in preparation for an indictment.\n\nStay updated with the latest news!\n\nSubscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter\n\nThe Central Unit in the Jerusalem District’s investigation team head Ras. Kamel Falah said, \"In this case, the investigation findings and various testimonies leave no doubt that the suspect is a terrorist operative servicing ISIS.”\n\n“The fact that he exploited his status as a student and the school environment to spread the terrorist organization's ideology and recruit others is serious. It's also alarming that many at the school, including several teachers, knew about this and did not report it to the authorities to stop him,” Falah continued.\n\n“This is a terror cell of one young ISIS supporter at a school who planned and attempted in every way to turn his classmates into terrorist operatives affiliated with the murderous organization and to carry out terrorist acts in the future. We will continue our determined and ongoing fight against terrorists wherever they are,\" Falah concluded.",

      "# [Lady Gaga Responds to Former Classmates Who Said She’d ‘Never Be Famous’ by Jessica Lynch on 2024-09-13](https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/lady-gaga-responds-to-former-classmates-never-be-famous-1235774641/)\nLady Gaga recently responded to an old Facebook group created by some of her ex-classmates, who mocked her dreams of stardom several years ago.\n\nGaga briefly attended NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts before leaving in 2005 to pursue a music career. At the time, she had just started performing under her now-iconic stage name, and word of her performances spread quickly among her peers, leading to the creation of the Facebook group titled “Stefani Germanotta, you will never be famous.”\n\nMembers of the group reportedly ridiculed her dreams of becoming famous, mocking her performances and aspirations.\n\nNow, a TikTok post that has gone viral, screenshots of the now-deleted Facebook group were shown, followed by a list of Gaga’s numerous accolades, including her 13 Grammy wins, an Oscar, and a long list of other prestigious awards.\n\nThe “Die With a Smile” singer herself commented on the video, addressing the hate she experienced during her early years: “Some people I went to college [with] made this way back when. This is why you can’t give up when people doubt you or put you down—gotta keep going.”\n\nGaga’s journey to fame wasn’t an overnight success.\n\nAfter leaving college, she began playing small gigs around New York City under the stage name Lady Gaga. Little did her classmates know, she’d go on to release The Fame just a few years later in 2008, with hits like “Just Dance” and “Poker Face” dominating the Billboard charts.\n\nIn 2016, one of her former classmates, Lauren Bohn, shared her memories of the Facebook group, recalling how the members would belittle Gaga’s ambitions and even trample on flyers for her shows.\n\n“I also remember one dude posting a flyer for one of her upcoming gigs at a local village bar. He had clearly stomped on the flyer, an outline of his muddy [sole] struggling to eclipse her name,” Bohn wrote, praising Gaga for sticking to her dreams and breaking through despite the negativity.\n\nSince those early days, Gaga has become one of the most decorated artists in the world. She’s won 13 Grammy Awards, including two for co-writing and performing her A Star Is Born anthem “Shallow,” which also earned her an Oscar.\n\nShe’s landed five No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 and six No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, including Born This Way and Chromatica. Her latest track with Bruno Mars, “Die With a Smile,” also scored the No. 1 spot on Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts."
