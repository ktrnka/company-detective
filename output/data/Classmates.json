      "# Post ID f51fx2: Received an email from classmates.com about account registration using my real full name. But I didn't make the account and the password is something I've never used. with +16 score by [(fritocloud, Reddit, 2020-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/f51fx2/received_an_email_from_classmatescom_about/)\nClassmates.com... sounds familiar right? The kings of spam. They came out before Facebook and friendster but they went with the premium model and I had assumed they would have went out of business. I know they were sued at one point for deceptive advertising practices because they would email you saying that something was happening with your account but you had to pay to see what it was. And then when you paid, you would discover that nothing was happening with your account. Well, I just got an email from them welcoming me to the site. The thing is, I didn't make an account with them. I honestly can't remember if I ever made one with this email account (I know I signed up with them at some point but I'm pretty sure I was still using an AOL account at the time, lol. And that was many many years ago.) Anyways, I've gotten emails like this before where someone is using my email address with random info and I just assume it is some sort of scammer or spammer or bots or whatever. I usually go in and report or deactivate the account and no big deal. But this is the first time it has ever happened with my real first and last name. The other weird thing is they are using my full first name and for most things that I sign up for, I use a shortened version of my name. Which makes it less likely they got my name from one of those data leaked lists but not impossible. \n\nThere is a button to report the account for \"being made in error\" but that's the final twist to this. I really don't trust classmates.com and I really don't want to click that link in the email until I know what's going on. The way I see it, this could just be a diabolical plot on classmates.com's part, trying to get customers for their site or whatever.\n\nSo, I guess what I'm looking for is any advice on how to handle this. I should note that I do monitor my credit reports pretty thoroughly so I'm not too worried about any kind of identity theft issues with my SSN attached. Also, has anyone else had this happen to them? With this specific site or another site? Does anyone have any idea how this would happen? I very much doubt it is a real person who just coincidentally has my exact name and that they mistakenly put *my* email address (which is fairly unique and does not have my name in it at all) in when they were signing up.\n\n[Here is a screenshot with my info and the info from the fraudulent account omitted.](http://imgur.com/a/FwRkO4G)\n\nAlso, [here is some dogtax](http://imgur.com/gallery/TzWkUWO) (not mine found it on imgur while uploading my screenshot. So cute.)\n\nThanks in advance, everyone.\n\n## Comment ID fhw7bmr with +14 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/f51fx2/received_an_email_from_classmatescom_about/fhw7bmr/) (in reply to ID f51fx2):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID fhwa4rw with +6 score by [(fritocloud, Reddit, 2020-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/f51fx2/received_an_email_from_classmatescom_about/fhwa4rw/) (in reply to ID fhw7bmr):\nJust the hope, though.

I'm not in Canada, and it was ten years ago I got a CK account I never used.\n\nIt was also very difficult to undo, or contact anyone saying \"not me, didn't sign  up, don't want it\". I had to call in my younger generation resources who hmm'd and said \"how odd\". But  did accomplish removal.\n\nIts a crummy practice and I doubt they really get any new business that way.

I've been able to find a couple websites for reconnecting with people he went to high school with, but I haven't found any for college. Does anyone know if there is one?

I’m in one for my class and the next years class when I actually graduated. But some might be restricted and tough to find. Three other things I’d look into. In 82 tech still\nHad a very robust corps of cadets. If he was in that they can help. If your dad was in a fraternity, check with the tech and the national charter and see if they can help. Also, check with the department that your dad majored in. Around this time people get nostalgic for the good old days and they get in contact w the department. Most of his professors will have retired, but the dept usually has an alumni database. Good luck, I hope you are successful.",

But instead of using that power to toy with peoples lives for the sake of curiousity, Ralsei does his best to avoid that type of disaster. He knows that Kris has this power, and he knows the dangers of it. \n\nInstead of asking please never do a true reset like Flowey does at the end of credits. Ralsei is lying to Kris, specifically to fool us(the players) into thinking he is on our side, while he is slowly building a way to get rid of the Determination power from Kris. He is on the good side with good intentions, but he is not on OUR side. Even if it's a pacifist run, he still thinks it's too dangerous to have such power, so away it must go.\n\nI mentioned this theory on an r/ralsei poll [recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/ralsei/comments/pcxkrg/what_direction_would_you_like_ralsei_to_go_in/).\n\n### Comment ID hb4jkhd with +8 score by [(Grand_reaper658, Reddit, 2021-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb4jkhd/) (in reply to ID hb3mr3i):\ntemmie adventure?\n\n#### Comment ID hb5h2o5 with +2 score by [(KittyWarrior1, Reddit, 2021-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb5h2o5/) (in reply to ID hb4jkhd):\nyAYA!!!\n\n### Comment ID hb6pd5y with +8 score by [(M-striker, Reddit, 2021-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb6pd5y/) (in reply to ID hb3mr3i):\nThis….\n\nI want to believe is a metaphor, mostly in FARMING EXP: whenever kris/soul/frisk gets EXP his DETERMINATION increases, a power that gives him the ability to RESET, SAVE, ETC.

Jockington wears sunglasses; one of the purple items is ‘Cloudy Glasses,’ Temmie wears a brimmed cap; ‘Cowboy hat,’ Noelle is associated with christmas; you tie gift boxes up with Ribbons, and a toy knife is a potential gift. Snowy is very defensive about his comedy and potentially uses humor as a defense to begin with, and the green heart items are very defensive focused gear. Monster kid is pretty brave, considering he can stand up to Undyne, while he is wearing orange and I guess the glove is just kind of ironic. We don’t get a good look at Catti’s normal get-up, but being a waitress does require some level of grace a la ballet. As for Berdley, maybe it makes a bit more sense if you think of there being two red souls; Chara and Frisk, and thus they’re sort of rivals who aren’t that different in the end? I wouldn’t be surprised if Berdley turns out to have a similar situation to Kris, with Noelle being their only ‘friend.’\n\n#### Comment ID hb4e9o4 with +7 score by [(_AntiSocialMedia, Reddit, 2021-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb4e9o4/) (in reply to ID hb4crx4):\nThing is, so far, everyone in Deltarune has the same personality as their Undertale counterparts, different relationships and different jobs, yeah, but still the same personality.\n\nAnd, well, Snowy just isn't *that* nice in Undertale, he straight up calls Frisk unfunny if they tell a joke because he's jealous, and we know it's jealousy, and not Frisk just being unfunny, because even *Ice Cap* and *Jerry* think Frisk's jokes are funny.\n\n### Comment ID hbll4vn with +4 score by [(TheLegend2T, Reddit, 2021-09-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hbll4vn/) (in reply to ID hb4adde):\nII like how there's no debate Jockington is Perseverance\n\n## Comment ID hb3bz7g with +12 score by [(pascuales, Reddit, 2021-08-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/pfcg31/the_flowers_are_kris_and_susies_classmates/hb3bz7g/) (in reply to ID pfcg31):\nMakes sense considering that we have the main characters (Frisk; Kris, Susie and Ralsei) but in Undertale we wouldn't be able to win without the souls' help.

Don’t worry about them, OR maybe you can even collaborate with  them. This is how art movements happen - common interests emerging in a certain milieu. There is a shift right now to challenge what is normal. It’s a new class consciousness. Seems OCD is a good subject to explore that. You can be a part of a bigger collective shift. We need less ego in art anyway.",

XRD was included because a classmate had a copy of the game for his PS4. XRD Was waaaay more difficult to teach my classmates due to air combos, bursting and general mechanics because XRD is an older game in the series and a lot more difficult for beginners. This one took even longer because of teaching, sparring matches, organization and just trying to keep the brackets fair. Trying to convince our cool librarian was a bit of a challenge. On top of that, me and another classmate bringing two PS4’s to school was difficult but worked out in the end. People still had plenty of fun until our only Chipp player slammed his controller after getting stomped by Eddie during the Strive tournament. It took much longer to organize this tournament considering that I'm just one dude. Both tournaments went well after getting organized and the winner for both tournaments got a Visa Gift Card with 30 dollars on them. Convincing some peeps to come back was difficult and some just didn't come back but due to newcomers who were interested after watching the first two tournaments we had 35 players. Of course, I didn't win the Strive tournament but won the XRD tourney with Jam. I can now afford elden ring thanks to the money I got from the tourney which is essentially fighting to keep my own cash      \\\\ ( ᗒᗨᗕ ) /\n\nHere's part one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/sehc57/guilty\\_gear\\_strive\\_tier\\_list\\_based\\_of\\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/sehc57/guilty_gear_strive_tier_list_based_of_a/)\n\nHere's part two: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/siq2qs/guilty\\_gear\\_strive\\_tier\\_list\\_made\\_by\\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/siq2qs/guilty_gear_strive_tier_list_made_by_my/)\n\nAnd as always, I came up with this idea due to this legend over here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/rct1oj/my\\_6th\\_grade\\_students\\_made\\_a\\_r\\_tier\\_list\\_after/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guiltygear/comments/rct1oj/my_6th_grade_students_made_a_r_tier_list_after/)\n\nIf you guys have any questions on how your favorite character or how players performed over all feel free to ask me!

      "# [Feinberg Classmates Reconnect at Alumni Weekend 2023 by Olivia Dimmer, <a href=\"https://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/byline/olivia-dimmer/\" rel=\"tag\">Olivia Dimmer</a> on 2023-10-16](https://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/2023/10/16/feinberg-classmates-reconnect-at-alumni-weekend-2023/)\nFor Alice Yeh, ‘93 MD, returning to Feinberg for Alumni Weekend was an emotional, full-circle moment in her career as a surgeon.\n\n“When I left Feinberg, I had gotten my degree and was just going out into the world. It brings up emotions just talking about it,” said Yeh, who returned to Chicago this weekend for the first time in the 30 years since she graduated. “I’m near the end of my career, and I have retirement on the horizon. I wanted to come back and see where I was when I first started. This is a very fulfilling moment for me.”\n\nIt was during her time at Feinberg when Yeh was inspired to go into surgery, she said. One of her mentors at the time let her scrub into an open-heart surgery: When she peered over the drape, she saw a patient’s beating heart for the first time. In that moment, she came to understand the importance of the specialty she would go on to devote her career to, she said. Now, Yeh practices surgical oncology at the Kaiser Permanente South San Francisco Medical Center.\n\n“I’m very proud of where I trained and it’s exciting to connect with my roots,” Yeh said of Feinberg. “I’m hoping in my future I can give back to the place that has invested so much in me.”\n\nYeh was one of the more than 400 alumni and guests who returned to Feinberg on October 13 and 14 to reconnect and reminisce with former classmates about their experiences at Feinberg and learn about the medical school’s latest achievements.\n\nAs a member of the Half Century Club — alumni who have been graduated for 50 years or more — Tom F. Keys, ‘63 MD, said he was excited to visit with classmates and offer his wisdom to current students.\n\n“There are not that many of us that are here from the class of 1963, but I’ve already met most of them and it’s just fun reflecting on what you did, where you share your memories,” Keys, now a retired infectious disease specialist, said. “I think the reason that I’m here is that I feel very strongly about medical education, making sure that our young people get a broad base and a reality check about what it’s like to be a good doctor.”\n\nDuring the weekend, alumni attended various social and educational events, including class dinners, tours of Chicago attractions, and tours of campus facilities, including the Northwestern Simulation Center and the Louis A. Simpson and Kimberly K. Querrey Biomedical Research Center.\n\nChandra Jadhwani, DPT, who graduated in ‘86 from Feinberg’s Doctor of Physical Therapy Program and currently practices in Illinois, said she particularly enjoyed the walking tour of Chicago, during which she learned more about the history of the various hospitals and medical centers in Chicago.\n\nThe weekend’s activities also included educational forums and lectures led by Feinberg faculty who discussed topics ranging from pathogen genomics and the biology of aging to the latest developments in artificial intelligence and digital technology in medicine.\n\nFollowing lectures on Friday afternoon, alumni and current Feinberg students mingled for a mentoring lunch, which was organized based on medical specialties.\n\n“I wanted to come back this weekend to see some old classmates and pay homage to the medical school that gave me a wonderful career,” said Martin G. White, ‘60 ‘63 MS MD, who celebrated his 60th reunion and shared his experiences in nephrology with current students during the lunch. “For a while now, I’ve been involved with teaching and encouraging young people to advance in their careers. I hope they appreciate this wonderful school and the generosity of those who support it.”\n\nNearby at Chicago’s historic Drake Hotel, alumnae gathered for the annual Women in Medicine Tea, which included a panel discussion featuring alumnae from various class years who shared their own professional journeys and advice about navigating career advancement and work-life balance.\n\nThe session was moderated by Shelly Vaziri Flais, ’99 MD ’02 GME, clinical assistant professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Community-Based Primary Care, who encouraged attendees to embrace non-traditional career trajectories and give themselves grace when it comes to balancing a career and family.\n\n“When I got back from maternity leave, my boss at a family practice pulled me into his office and said ‘I need you to work more, and if you can’t, I’m going to hire someone who will,’” Flais said. “It was devastating at the time. But it ended up being a wonderful thing for me. I had twins and had become very passionate about helping other families with twins, which led me to publish my first parenting book.”\n\nThe day was concluded with remarks from Eric G. Neilson, MD, vice president for Medical Affairs and Lewis Landsberg Dean, who gave an overview of the state of the medical school during “Conversations with the Dean.”\n\n“I’m delighted to give our alumni an update on what’s happening and where things are heading,” Neilson said. “In 2023, Feinberg is almost a billion-dollar enterprise. It has a very large research portfolio, now over 700 million dollars.”\n\nNeilson went on to update alumni on the medical school’s recent achievements, which included Feinberg’s involvement in the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago and ranking among top medical schools in the country.\n\nOn Friday evening, attendees gathered for an all-alumni reception and dinner, which included a salute to the milestone reunion classes, ranging from the class of 1973 to 2013.\n\nDuring the dinner, this year’s Distinguished Alumni Award was presented to Anthony J. Schaeffer, ‘68 MD, the Herman L. Kretschmer Professor of Urology, whom Neilson lauded as an expert in his field.\n\nSchaeffer, who has published more than 400 peer-reviewed research articles, dedicated his career to understanding urinary tract infections, inflammation and incontinence. He was the first to describe the systemic changes of bacteria that cause UTIs in women and developed novel management techniques.\n\n“Tony joined Northwestern’s Department of Urology and he quickly rose through the ranks and he led as department chair for 25 years. He’s been the recipient of many prestigious honors… but if you ask Tony, he’ll say his proudest accomplishment is his family,” Neilson said.",
      "# [Pitt taught me to stand up against injustice, then sent police to beat my classmates - The Pitt News by opinionsdesk, Livia Daggett on 2024-06-07](https://pittnews.com/article/188699/opinions/opinion-pitt-taught-me-to-stand-up-against-injustice-then-sent-police-to-beat-my-classmates/)\nHere is a list of things I’ve learned in my three years at Pitt.\n\n1. During my first-year orientation, I was told the Pitt Police and University officials are here to protect and support me. I was told to add the police phone number to my contacts.\n\n2. In the first-year course “Anti-Black Racism: History, Ideology, and Resistance,” I was told via the Canvas site that “Various institutions, including universities, have sought to address anti-Black racism and inequities within their own organizations. The University of Pittsburgh has chosen to use this course to bring awareness and develop knowledge around anti-Black racism for its students.” I was offered further reading on how to be anti-racist, about the history of colonialism and about how, as Keisha N. Blain writes in one of the articles linked in the course, “The Fight Against Racism Has Always Been Global.”\n\n3. I learned in introductory and intermediate nonfiction that every choice made when reporting a story matters. Words matter, context matters, what we choose to cover and not cover matters.\n\nChancellor Joan Gabel’s June 5 email characterized what appeared to be plywood as having, vividly, “what appeared to be the intent to ignite.” This is lovely prose that I encourage her to bookmark for a novel about a secret plot to overthrow a government. Speculation does not belong in an email from a university administrator to concerned affiliates — most of whom, at the time, had no other information about the situation.\n\nThe email stated that antisemitic graffiti was sprayed on the Frick Fine Arts building. The only photo that I saw circulating online shows graffiti that reads “Free Gaza,” and some students report that other graffiti read “Cops beat students” — as indeed they did — and “F— Israel.” While some find the last disturbing, calling it antisemitic falls into the weary trap of conflating criticism of the state of Israel with antisemitism. Doing so worsens, rather than addresses, antisemitism. It also obscures the presumed point of the graffiti if it was indeed sprayed by someone protesting a state committing incredible violence against civilians.\n\nWhen asked to comment, a University spokesperson said, “For some, the graffiti sprayed on the Frick Fine Arts building might not meet the definition of antisemitism. For others, the graffiti was in proximity to other vandalism that included a weapon thrown through a building window, as well as concurrent demands for the cessation of Jewish student organizations and calls to end certain international definitions of antisemitism, which all created a context and the resulting description.”\n\nGabel is not a journalist, but her words arrive in every Pitt associate’s inbox, and she has an ethical responsibility to provide accurate and complete updates on happenings at the University.\n\n4. I learned from a lawyer in “Constitution and Civil Liberties” that students’ rights to free expression do not disappear when they step into class. Public universities, in particular, are taken to be forums of intense exchange and debate. Suppression of political speech receives the highest level of scrutiny at the legal level. But free speech is not just a legal protection — it’s a cultural value that we must protect.\n\nSome of the most iconic nonviolent protests in history involved disrupting private property — lunch counters, the site of the Boston Tea Party, and yes, university halls. Defending free speech is not just for pleasant, scheduled, quiet picket protests on sidewalks. Attempts to characterize it this way, from the right and left alike, are dangerous. Almost all the protests we’ve seen at Pitt and around the country — of students attempting to engage in peaceful, earnest political protest on their own campuses — are in the exact spirit of free expression, yet they’re being characterized as inherently violent, antisemitic, dangerous and full of external interlopers. This portrayal then gets used to justify brutal violence.\n\nThe chancellor’s email closed by rather hollowly reiterating the University’s “commitment to free expression and critical inquiry.” It claimed that the protests “are attempts to destroy property at the historical core of our campus, as well as accompanying action that in no way elevates open inquiry or allows for peaceful advocacy.” Yet the University has shown perfunctory interest in open inquiry, demonstrated by its refusal to engage with the intent to seriously consider divestment and its deafening silence on the suffering of Palestine, even when it immediately condemned the events of Oct. 7. Seeing through the attempt to portray these political protests as a wanton desire to destroy property is comically easy.\n\nWhen asked to comment, a University spokesperson said, “We are committed to free speech and civil discourse and how all this makes our students feel. We routinely meet with students on a variety of topics and issues including a recent discussion regarding the University’s investments. We do so within appropriate time, place and manner policies that exist to keep our community safe. Any suggestion that members of this administration have refused to meet and engage with students is completely false.”\n\n5. From my “Rights and Human Rights” course, PHIL 1400, I learned that during the genocide in Rwanda, the U.S. and other nations consistently refused to use the “g-word” because it would oblige them to act under the genocide convention.\n\nI learned that the US and other nations, to quote from a handout by my professor summarizing the 2002 Pulitzer-winning book “’A Problem from Hell’: America and the Age of Genocide” by Harvard professor Samantha Power, “tend to downplay the violence and claim that first-hand reports are exaggerated due to trauma. It is now clear from repeated cases that sustained first-hand claims of genocide are reliable and accurate.” History has shown that the genocide convention is usually invoked only after genocide occurs, at which point the perpetrators are “held accountable” and the world congratulates itself on its morality.\n\nI learned that the definition of genocide includes the murder with intent to destroy in whole or in part of a group and that Raphael Lemkin, a Polish Jewish lawyer who created and advocated for the adoption of the term after World War II to an unwilling UN, believed that a group did not have to be physically eliminated to experience genocide.\n\nHe argued that the eight components of genocide were “the disintegration of political and social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, religion, and the economic existence of national groups, and the destruction of the personal security, liberty, health, dignity, and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups.”\n\nI learned, while writing my final paper, that in 1985, Israel began paving a parking lot over the Maman Allah Cemetery, where companions of the Prophet Muhammad and thousands of Islamic scholars were buried. 95% of its graves were exhumed to build the parking lot and — not satire — the Museum of Tolerance, yet to be completed. According to the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the completed museum will address “hate, human dignity and responsibility, and promoting unity and respect among Jews and people of all faiths.”\n\nWhat more can be said? My heart smarts at those professors and classmates who were incredulous in class that history allowed incredible violence and hatred again and again but who now speak about Palestine in hushed tones or not at all.\n\nMonday’s University response makes me ashamed to be associated with Pitt, as does its silence on Gaza all these months. This university is willing to chill student free expression and shell out thousands of dollars toward a violent police force that beats its own students bloody seemingly in the name of protecting the Cathedral grass from bald spots. Yet it will not say “Palestine.” It’s simpler to maintain a facade of academic neutrality as thousands of children near death by starvation and their parents and siblings lose their limbs and lives.\n\nWhy is it so incredible to believe that students feel deep empathy for people being murdered and living under occupation and seek actual redress? Why is it controversial that no university should have any investments in any entities remotely connected to any military? Why is it not standard policy for public universities to make their endowment portfolios public?\n\nI urge Pitt administrators to have the courage to join the ranks of universities turning toward Palestinian liberation. Pitt, your education has taught me again and again that the world shouldn’t be this way. Palestine will be free, and unwillingness to be part of that process will forever be an example taught in your classrooms of complicity. Go sit in on your own lessons.",

Edna Milanga ’21, MBA ’23, and her daughter attended Illinois State at the same time.\n\nAppears In Illinois State: Spring 2024\n\nOriginally from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Milanga started her academic journey at Heartland Community College, earning an associate degree and making her way through English as a second language classes before transferring to Illinois State to earn a bachelor’s degree in international business. Milanga later enrolled in Illinois State’s MBA program. Kazigwa wasn’t far behind, transferring to Illinois State for its computer networking and telecommunications program.\n\nTheir mother-daughter bond only grew when they became Illinois State classmates. Milanga and Kazigwa made time for each other during the week, meeting for meals and running errands together.\n\n“She was (on campus) early in the morning, and I would be there in the afternoon,” said Milanga. “Sometimes we would go for lunch in Watterson and have a good time. We went to the bookstore to order textbooks, and we went to a job fair together.”\n\nThey also used their experiences to help each other. Milanga guided her daughter through class scheduling. Kazigwa offered technology expertise in return.\n\n“We do homework together,” said Milanga. “She’s good with the computer, so when I’m stuck and frustrated, she helps me troubleshoot.”\n\nMilanga and Kazigwa said their unique experience brought them closer together.\n\n“We became closer friends. We shop together, do our nails together, watch shows together,” said Milanga. “She’s my BFF.”\n\nKazigwa walked across the same commencement stage as her mother last December.\n\nThis time, Milanga did the cheering.",

      "# [Focus on Bethel Park as classmates describe suspected Trump gunman by Edward Helmore, www.theguardian.com on 2024-07-15](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/15/trump-rally-shooter-bethel-park-pennsylvania)\nIn Bethel Park, where the man who is suspected of opening fire at a Donald Trump campaign rally on Saturday lived with his mother and sister, the houses are small and built of brick, Walmart and Target form central social hubs, and moms watch over their children at a junior league baseball park next to a tributary of the Allegheny River.\n\nThe attempted assassination of the Republican former president just 45 miles north has put a focus on Bethel Park, as investigators attempt to establish the motivations of the 20-year-old shooter.\n\nAuthorities on Sunday identified the suspect as Thomas Matthew Crooks. Officials said they believe Crooks acted alone. But so far, they have not been able to uncover a motivation that drove the young man to unleash a hail of bullets at Trump, wounding the former president and killing a former fire chief who was shielding his daughters.\n\nThe FBI said it would continue to investigate the attack as an attempted assassination and an act of domestic terrorism.\n\n“The information that we have indicates that the shooter acted alone,” said Kevin Rojek, supervisory special agent in charge of the FBI’s Pittsburgh field office. “At present, we have not identified an ideology associated with the subject, but I want to remind everyone that we’re still very early in this investigation.”\n\nThe FBI said Crook had not been on their radar. Since his identification, a fragmentary portrait has emerged, almost by virtue of its omissions. He was employed as a dietary aide at Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center. The nursing home’s administrator Marcie Grimm said Crooks “performed his job without concern and his background check was clean”.\n\nNor have there been significant clues found in his political affiliations. He had registered Republican but had also donated $15 to the liberal ActBlue political action committee on Joe Biden’s inauguration day. He had no past criminal cases against him, according to public court records.\n\nClaire, a young woman who had known Crooks through his elder sister and who did not provide a last name, said she could not quite believe the boy she had once known had attempted to assassinate a US president.\n\n“He’s so young to want to go do that,” she said.\n\nShe said Crooks had had a difficult time socially. “He wasn’t the most attractive-looking and I don’t think he did sports that can add appeal,’” she said.\n\nFormer classmates who spoke to other news outlets filled in other memories. Some described Crooks as smart and shy. Others spoke of a long history of being bullied. An unnamed former classmate told the New York Post that Crooks was “a loner”. He said: “He probably had a friend group, but not many friends.”\n\nJameson Myers said that Crooks had tried out for the school rifle team but had not made the roster. “He didn’t just not make the team, he was asked not to come back because how bad of a shot he was, it was considered, like, dangerous,” Myers told ABC News. Jameson Murphy told the Post that Crooks was “a comically bad shot”.\n\nMax R Smith said to the Philadelphia Inquirer that Crooks “definitely was conservative”. “It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate,” Smith said.\n\nWith a nation on edge, establishing Crook’s motives is seen as a key to unlocking larger issues of deep political discord.\n\n“We’re looking into his background, his day-to-day activities, any writings and social media posts that might help us identify what led to this shooting,”, the FBI’s Rojek said. “We have not seen anything threatening at this time”.",
      "# [Georgia State Students Make Food Options More Accessible for Classmates on 2024-06-10](https://news.gsu.edu/2024/06/10/georgia-state-students-make-food-options-more-accessible-for-classmates/)\nATLANTA — Georgia State undergraduate students Harita Yepuri and Sudip Agrahari, along with their mentor Assistant Professor of Nutrition Nida I. Shaikh, have created an exhaustive database for all on- and off-campus dining options surrounding Georgia State’s six campuses.\n\nAgrahari, a computer information systems major who will begin his sophomore year this fall, began the project in October 2023 as a University Assistantship Program research scholar with Shaikh. Initially, they started by assessing the number of halal food options available on Georgia State’s campuses as part of a larger funded project, but the work expanded to build a comprehensive database of all options where food is available on and around campus.\n\n“While we were delving into understanding the availability of halal food on campus, we figured that if we were already doing that, then it would be good to know what the overall food environment was like,” Agrahari said.\n\n“Food environments are really closely tied to nutrition, and they can affect your health and your health outcomes, so that’s why this is important,” Yepuri, a neuroscience major, continued. “Over 18 million people in the U.S. are pursuing higher education and most of those students are spending up to or more than 30 hours per week on campus, so if they don't have an accommodating food environment and they don't know where to find that kind of information, it just makes life a lot more difficult.”\n\nOver the course of five months, Yepuri and Agrahari visited Georgia State’s Alpharetta, Clarkston, Decatur, Dunwoody, Newton and Atlanta campuses, and surveyed all food options on campus and within a half-mile radius. They visited and made note of every restaurant, dining hall and vending machine.\n\nWith this data, Agrahari created a searchable online map with over 200 places where food is available across Georgia State’s campuses, as well as the extent to which vegetarian, vegan, kosher and halal foods were available at each one. Yepuri used the data for her honor’s thesis comparing the campus food environment across all six campuses.\n\nYepuri and Agrahari have presented their research at the Lewis College Research Day and Georgia State Undergraduate Research Conference, and the Chemistry Graduate Student Association Symposium. Yepuri has been selected to share her honor’s thesis research at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, and Shaikh will present at the Society for Nutrition, Education and Behavior later this summer.\n\nYepuri and Agrahari would like to make their food map a tool for all students to use.\n\n“Something we’d like to do is make the food map available to new students through a QR code on their orientation packets,” Agrahari said.\n\nAgrahari and Yepuri have also partnered with Panther’s Pantry, an initiative that provides supplemental food assistance and basic necessities to those in the university community. Panther’s Pantry locations are included in the map that Agrahari created to make them easier to locate for people who may need them.\n\n“We want to be able to tell students that there are these resources available to them and where they can go and get them,” Agrahari said. “With the university’s size, it can be hard for them to actually find these places.”\n\nThey also hope this project leads to more inclusive food options for students.\n\n“Georgia State is one of the largest universities in the Southeastern United States. It’s also a Minority Serving Institution and a public R01 university. A lot of students go here and it’s a pretty diverse student body,” Yepuri said. “If we can accommodate for diets that cater to one’s culture and/or religion — restrictive diets — then we can really help them feel like they fit in here.”\n\n— Story by Katherine Duplessis",
      "# [An inspiration to classmates and community by Maria Lamarca Anderson on 2024-06-21](https://www.uwb.edu/news/2024/06/21/an-inspiration-to-classmates-and-community)\nIn May, UW Bothell senior Puneet Birk was awarded the Chancellor’s Medal, an award that recognizes graduating students who have inspired their peers and faculty by overcoming significant obstacles while completing their degree or certificate program.\n\n“I was in shock,” said Birk, a first-generation college student. “You always think about how other people feel when they win an award, but I was bringing this home to my house. It felt surreal.”\n\nRecipients of the Chancellor’s Medal are nominated by UW Bothell faculty, staff or fellow students, and those in this 20-year-old’s circle were unanimous: She’s been an inspiration to those around her through academic excellence, her resilience in the face of family hardship and her work as an influential student leader.\n\n“Puneet embodies the very essence of the Chancellor’s Medal — she’s an inspiration, overcoming profound personal challenges to not only succeed but also uplift those around her,” said Ahmed Mohamad, a senior majoring in Business Administration who served as ASUWB vice president.\n\nPushing for more\n\nBirk, who was a Running Start student, joined UW Bothell as a junior. She sought to challenge herself, taking a full load of classes and applying to become a legislative liaison for the Associated Students of the University of Washington Bothell. The student lobbyist position required her to temporarily relocate to Olympia and inspired her to declare her major in Law, Economics & Public Policy.\n\n“After working with the legislature and working with an entire team at a lobbying firm, I just fell in love with policy and the entire process of it,” said Birk. “Also, my dad is a businessman and I’ve seen him work with legal parties. It’s always interested me.”\n\nAside from her studies, Birk has held two part-time jobs as a student leader. In spring 2023, she became the youngest-ever elected president of the ASUWB. Meanwhile, she also served as president of the Washington Student Association, a student-led nonprofit organization that facilitates statewide student organizing and advocacy at colleges and universities.\n\n“For nearly two years, I’ve watched Puneet triumph as a student leader,” said Brittany Mayes, Birk’s adviser and associate director of Student Engagement & Activities. “As ASUWB liaison, she really trailblazed best lobby practices for her team members and advocated for her fellow students in Olympia. She took her role as president very seriously, too.”\n\nFostering student joy and inclusion\n\nBirk researched the feasibility of creating a “common hour” on campus when she served as ASUWB president. During this hour, the hope is that no classes will be scheduled so that students can have more time to engage with student clubs and enjoy their college experience. Over this summer quarter, the registrar’s office will begin analyzing how this blocked hour can be effectively implemented.\n\nTo deepen student representation and to establish more checks and balances for the ASUWB team, Birk helped build up a student senate after it was dismantled during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“With our growing population, I realized we were a team often trying our best to represent nearly 6,000 students. It’s just not an equitable representation of all the demographics. There are just not physically enough hands,” Birk said. “So, our vice president, our policy and personnel coordinator and I — each of us — did a lot of work on creating the bylaws and structure for recreating a student senate.”\n\nBirk also worked to help improve campus safety and expand food options in the new campus dining hall.\n\n“Her presidency was about creating a more engaged, inclusive and supportive campus community,” said Mohamad. “She wanted every student to feel seen, heard and valued.”\n\nMeeting hardship with grace\n\nEven as she’s triumphed as a student and a student leader, Birk has faced some personal challenges. When she started at UW Bothell, her mother was dealing with a series of critical health issues that forced Birk to take on more responsibilities at home.\n\n“The biggest challenge was navigating my mom’s mental health, especially because mental health is a completely different thing for her generation,” Birk said. “My caretaking involved trying to explain what these challenges can look like, such as what anxiety truly is. So, I was not only trying to make sure that everybody was on the same page of how we could help mom get better but also ensuring that we were actively helping her to get better.”\n\nThen, in April 2023, Birk lost her “Big Dad,” her beloved grandfather who was a fixture of their family and of their larger Sikh and Punjabi communities.\n\n“He practically raised us. I feel losing him really opened my eyes to grief, and it also brought me closer to my religion” she said. “But it was a lot, and as a student, the homework never stops, so I really had to push through.”\n\nBirk has not only overcome, but she has excelled. She made the dean’s list this year and has continued to stay involved with numerous school clubs and mentor fellow ASUWB members.\n\n“The loss she endured could have dimmed any spirit, but Puneet’s resolve only grew stronger,” said Mohamad.\n\nHer presidency was about creating a more engaged, inclusive and supportive campus community. She wanted every student to feel seen, heard and valued.\n\nAhmed Mohamad, senior, Business Adminstration\n\nA bright future\n\nBirk graduated in June with her bachelor’s degree, and she is looking forward to law school. She’s currently studying for the Law School Admission Test, which she will take later this year. She hopes to attend the University of California, Los Angeles, or University of California, Berkeley, (or perhaps an Ivy League school) and eventually practice corporate law.\n\nDuring UW Bothell’s Commencement ceremony at T-Mobile Park, Birk was recognized by Chancellor Esterberg as recipient of the 2024 Chancellor’s Medal and, as ASUWB president, gave her final speech to her classmates.\n\nHer remarks centered around her beloved grandpa’s mantra, “kush roh.” This means “stay happy,” in Punjabi, Birk explained. “It’s a reminder to embrace joy in every moment, regardless of life’s challenges and uncertainties.”\n\nWith her enthusiastic demeanor, compassionate leadership, enduring work ethic and deep devotion to family, Birk beautifully embodies her grandfather’s mantra — and the ethos behind one of UW Bothell’s most prestigious student awards.",

At the time, she had just started performing under her now-iconic stage name, and word of her performances spread quickly among her peers, leading to the creation of the Facebook group titled “Stefani Germanotta, you will never be famous.”\n\nMembers of the group reportedly ridiculed her dreams of becoming famous, mocking her performances and aspirations.\n\nNow, a TikTok post that has gone viral, screenshots of the now-deleted Facebook group were shown, followed by a list of Gaga’s numerous accolades, including her 13 Grammy wins, an Oscar, and a long list of other prestigious awards.\n\nThe “Die With a Smile” singer herself commented on the video, addressing the hate she experienced during her early years: “Some people I went to college [with] made this way back when. This is why you can’t give up when people doubt you or put you down—gotta keep going.”\n\nGaga’s journey to fame wasn’t an overnight success.\n\nAfter leaving college, she began playing small gigs around New York City under the stage name Lady Gaga. Little did her classmates know, she’d go on to release The Fame just a few years later in 2008, with hits like “Just Dance” and “Poker Face” dominating the Billboard charts.\n\nIn 2016, one of her former classmates, Lauren Bohn, shared her memories of the Facebook group, recalling how the members would belittle Gaga’s ambitions and even trample on flyers for her shows.\n\n“I also remember one dude posting a flyer for one of her upcoming gigs at a local village bar. He had clearly stomped on the flyer, an outline of his muddy [sole] struggling to eclipse her name,” Bohn wrote, praising Gaga for sticking to her dreams and breaking through despite the negativity.\n\nSince those early days, Gaga has become one of the most decorated artists in the world. She’s won 13 Grammy Awards, including two for co-writing and performing her A Star Is Born anthem “Shallow,” which also earned her an Oscar.\n\nShe’s landed five No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 and six No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, including Born This Way and Chromatica. Her latest track with Bruno Mars, “Die With a Smile,” also scored the No. 1 spot on Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts.",

Riley always shared her phone’s location with her friends, Tiller said.\n\nRiley’s body was found with “visible injuries” in a forested area behind Lake Herrick on Thursday, police have said. She had gone out for a jog at the Intramural Fields that morning, and when she didn’t return hours later, her friend called the police.\n\nRiley died of blunt force trauma.\n\nThe suspect, identified as Jose Antonio Ibarra, 26, of Athens, has been charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another, police said Friday.\n\nThere was no indication that Ibarra and Riley knew each other, according to UGA Police Chief Jeff Clark, who called it a “crime of opportunity” and said there was no further threat to the campus. Ibarra was being held in the Clarke County Jail.\n\nRoommates, friends remember Riley as selfless, loving\n\nLilly Steiner, another friend from UGA, thanked Riley in a tribute posted Saturday on Instagram for “helping me find the joy in life.”\n\n“You put everyone before yourself everyday, and you loved like no one else,” Sofia Magana, one of Riley’s roommates at UGA, said on Instagram.\n\n“You were supposed to be by my side on my wedding day, you were supposed to be with us on graduation ... but most importantly you were supposed to be here with us,” Magana wrote.\n\nSophia Palomino said in a tribute post that Riley “taught me so many lessons about life, friendship & sisterhood” and that “her love has changed me for the better.” She added that she admired how Riley was always putting others before herself.\n\nConnolly Huth, who also lived with Riley, recalled their shared memories and said she and Riley were supposed to run their first marathon together.\n\n“I will run that 26.2 in your honor and let everyone know of the perfect, beautiful, hilarious, smart, kind, and driven human that Laken Riley was,” Huth wrote in an Instagram post.\n\nRiley attended the University of Georgia through the spring 2023 semester and was studying at nearby Augusta University College of Nursing at the time of her death. In a statement, the school called her “a promising future nurse” who made the dean’s list in the fall.\n\nA GoFundMe page was set up in Riley’s honor to help her family with funeral costs and with hopes of starting a scholarship in her name.\n\nCommunity reeling from Riley’s death\n\nOn Saturday, security waited outside the Alpha Chi Omega sorority house, where Riley was still an active member, as students with flowers in their hands rushed to and from their cars, heads down and focused, wearing a grim look.\n\nThe tension on the campus Saturday was palpable.\n\nOne student clutched pepper spray as she crossed the street. She said up until this week, it was gathering dust in her car.\n\nA small memorial grew by Lake Herrick, where Riley was last seen alive, as well as by the famed UGA arch. Students who never met Riley gave it a somber acknowledgement as they walked past.\n\n“It’s really upsetting. I know that I love to run, and so to know that that could’ve been me, that could’ve been anyone on this campus, it’s just terrible. It could be anybody,” UGA student Millicent Dye said.\n\nA quiet fear also lurks just off campus among a pocket of Venezuelans living in Athens.\n\nFrom outside Andreina Rivas’ apartment in the same community as Ibarra, she described in Spanish the shock and fear of seeing police swarming her street, only to find out it was because the suspect, whom she’d never met, was living just down the road from her.\n\nRivas threw her hands up in frustration, re-enacting the moment she said she found out the suspect’s family was Venezuelan, like her.\n\nRivas said that in a group chat with other Venezuelans, some expressed fears that locals would “come after Venezuelans.”\n\nSuspect’s brother also facing legal trouble\n\nThe suspect’s brother, Diego Ibarra, 29, was also taken into custody Friday and federally charged with possessing a fraudulent green card, according to a release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Georgia.\n\nDiego Ibarra is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela, the U.S. attorney’s office said. He was also being held in the Clarke County Jail. It was not immediately clear if he had retained legal representation.\n\nHe was approached by police Friday because he matched the description of the suspect in the investigation into Riley’s death, the U.S. attorney’s office said. He allegedly showed officers his fake green card as a form of identification.\n\nPolice determined the card to be fraudulent and charged Diego Ibarra. He is being held in state custody and faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if convicted, according to the U.S. attorney’s office.\n\nA spokesperson for UGA said he was fired from his position at the university after they learned of the alleged fake green card.\n\n“Diego Ibarra presented a fake green card to the hiring unit to begin a temporary position as a dishwasher in Bolton Dining Hall at the University of Georgia on Feb. 6, 2024,” the spokesperson said. “He subsequently failed to submit further documentation required to keep the job and was never paid by the University.”\n\nHe has been arrested three times on nonviolent offenses since he came to the U.S., according to the U.S. attorney’s office.\n\nJose Ibarra’s arrest has started a political firestorm within the conservative movement regarding immigration and border policy.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp demanded answers from President Joe Biden on Ibarra’s immigration status and asylum claims by his brother.\n\n“Laken Riley’s tragic death struck the hearts of Georgians everywhere and has rightfully sparked national outrage,” Kemp said in a statement. “As I have said many times before: every state is now a border state because of Joe Biden’s inaction, and today I am again demanding answers and information from the Biden Administration that will help us protect our citizens when the federal government will not.”\n\nJose Ibarra is not a U.S. citizen, police said. His immigration status was not clear. A public defender who represented Ibarra at a bond hearing did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Sunday.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Ibarra was arrested by Customs and Border Protection on Sept. 8, 2022, after unlawfully entering the country near El Paso, Texas.\n\nHe was paroled and released for further processing, but was arrested on Sept. 14, 2023, by the New York Police Department and charged with “acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation,” ICE said.\n\nThe NYPD released Ibarra before ICE could issue a detainer — a request that a law enforcement agency keep hold of non-citizens who have been arrested on criminal charges and are eligible for deportation so that ICE can take them into custody — the immigration agency said.\n\nICE said it issued a detainer for Ibarra following his arrest Friday.\n\nSuspect’s neighbors recall police swarming complex\n\nJennifer Slonaker and Ricky Carter, husband and wife, live in the Argo Apartment Community in Athens in one of the units above where Ibarra was living.\n\n“We’d see him out and about. There wasn’t a lot of conversation because we think he spoke Spanish. Nothing out of the ordinary. They seemed normal enough, everyone in that apartment. Three men and a woman,” Slonaker said.\n\nAround noon Friday, the couple said they saw police swarm the complex.\n\n“There wasn’t an inch of this place that didn’t have a cop on it. … They knocked and search every door in this complex, but they started with the one downstairs. They knew what and who they were looking for,” Slonaker said.\n\nThe couple described seeing Ibarra walk away in handcuffs. He didn’t look around, remained quiet and focused ahead of him, they said. His brother Diego followed in handcuffs shortly thereafter.\n\nSlonaker and her husband spoke to NBC News from outside their apartment, sharing details in between drags on a cigarette. Their regular smoke breaks are, in part, why they noticed the forensics team downstairs didn’t leave Ibarra’s apartment until 2:30 Saturday morning.\n\nCarter looked around, almost hesitating to keep his voice from traveling downstairs for a moment.\n\n“Makes me feel some type of way you can be amongst a killer and not even know it,” he said.\n\nMarissa Parra reported from Athens, Georgia, and Rebecca Cohen from New York City.",

It also said the teacher was initially suspended and then resigned on Nov. 2, before the district could begin termination proceedings.\n\n“IPS does not tolerate the type of behavior alleged in the complaint and takes reports of potential abuse and neglect seriously,” the district's statement said. “When IPS learned of the teacher’s conduct, the Department of Child Services (DCS) was immediately notified, and the teacher was removed from the classroom and suspended. The teacher had no further contact with students and is no longer employed by IPS.”\n\nThe district also said it was not made aware of the allegations the teacher encouraged fights until the parent emailed the principal on the evening of Oct. 30. But the principal did not see the email until the next morning and immediately contacted the Department of Child Services and the school system’s human resources personnel, the district said.\n\nA spokesperson for the district said Thursday that Johnson, the superintendent, and the school principal would not comment on the allegations.\n\nAttempts to reach Johnican, who is described as a first-year teacher in the district in the suit, were unsuccessful Thursday afternoon. Phone calls to numbers associated with his relatives were not answered.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the second grader was “thrown to the ground, struck, slapped, and hit in the head repeatedly\" in at least three attacks.\n\nJohnican, the suit says, held the child on two occasions while “allowing other students to punch, hit and kick him.”\n\nThe child’s mother had repeated meetings with Johnican to discuss her son’s allegations, but Johnican dismissed them and attributed the problem to the student’s behavioral issues and said the student was lying or mentally ill, the lawsuit says.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, on Sept. 22, the child’s mother told the vice principal of the allegations after she was called to the school because her son was hysterical and unable to calm down.\n\nHis mother went to the school that day and observed him in the classroom for 45 minutes. That day, her son again told her he was being abused in school, the suit says.\n\n“O.D. informed his mother that in the teacher’s presence and by his direction that another student had slammed his head down on a desk, pulled him to the floor, and then hit him repeatedly in the head. He directly indicated this was being done at the instruction of his teacher Mr. Johnican,” the lawsuit said.\n\nThe child, according to the suit, began asking to avoid school, and his grades slipped.\n\nOn Nov. 1, his parents had a meeting with Johnican, who intended to show a video of his classroom’s environment but instead inadvertently began showing a video of the student being attacked, the suit says.\n\n“When the parent attempted to grab the phone, he inadvertently turned up the volume where the parents could hear that it was him, the teacher, instigating and encouraging the beating of their disabled seven-year-old child,” according to the lawsuit.\n\n“The distressing content of the video made by Johnican shows O.D. on the floor crying as he is repeatedly punched in the face and head by a peer who is sitting on top of him as he cries out and begs for the attack to cease,\" it says.\n\nIn an interview with the Department of Child Services, the student said that he was assaulted twice in October and that Johnican held him down in one instance while a first grader slapped his face, according to the suit. And in a second alleged incident, Johnican held his shoulders while another student punched him in the stomach and kicked him in his legs, the suit said.\n\nSome of the claims in the lawsuit include negligent care and supervision; negligent hiring, retention and supervision; and intentional infliction of serious emotional distress.\n\nThe child is now homeschooled, he has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and he is in therapy at least once a week, the lawsuit said.\n\nThe suit requests a jury trial and says damages will be determined at trial.",

Some parents turned to the Westfield Police Department.\n\nDorota Mani, who owns a Jersey City day care, was already worried about the impact artificial intelligence could have on kids.\n\n\"AI problem. I would call it 'AI pandemic' at this point,\" she said.\n\nShe says she's even more worried now that her daughter, a Westfield High School student, has become a victim.\n\n\"My daughter texted me, 'Mom, naked pictures of me are being distributed.' That's it. Heading to the principal's office,\" Mani said.\n\nParents later got the following email from the principal:\n\n\"I am writing to make you aware of a situation that resulted in widespread misinformation and resulted in significant worry and concern amongst the student body of Westfield High School. Earlier today, students brought to our attention that some of our students had used Artificial Intelligence to create pornographic images from original photos. There was a great deal of concern about who had images created of them and if they were shared. At this time, we believe that any created images have been deleted and are not being circulated. This is a very serious incident. We are continuing to investigate and will inform individuals and families of students involved once the investigation is complete. This will happen before the weekend. We made counseling available for all affected students and encouraged them to return to class when they felt able to do so. Additionally, our School Resource Officer and the Westfield PD have been made aware of our investigation. If a parent/guardian thinks their child is a victim of a criminal act in relation to this incident please report the matter to Westfield Police.\n\n\"I wanted to make you aware of the situation, as, in addition to harming the students involved and disrupting the school day, it is critically important to talk with your children about their use of technology and what they are posting, saving and sharing on social media. New technologies have made it possible to falsify images and students need to know the impact and damage those actions can cause to others.\n\n\"We will continue to educate your children on the importance of responsible use of technology and hope you reinforce these messages at home.\"\n\nThese kinds of altered pictures are known online as \"deepfakes.\"\n\n\"She started crying, and then she was walking in the hallways and seeing other girls of Westfield High School crying, some of them victims and some of them just friends of the victims that just felt for them,\" Mani said.\n\nMani says she did file a police report.\n\nPolice told CBS New York they have no comment.\n\n\"It's something that we will need to learn, our children will need to be aware of,\" Mani said.\n\nCongress is considering a bill introduced by Rep. Joe Morelle, of New York, that would make it illegal to share nonconsensual \"deepfake\" images online.\n\nMani and her daughter plan to advocate for laws to protect people from deepfakes.\n\n\"Her words -- 'We don't want to wait for a tragedy to happen, we should do something proactively,'\" Mani said.\n\nA district spokesperson tells CBS New York the incident happened over the summer but was brought to the attention of school administrators on Oct. 20.\n\nSchool Superintendent Dr. Raymond González released the following statement:\n\n\"All school districts are grappling with the challenges and impact of artificial intelligence and other technology available to students at any time and anywhere. The Westfield Public School District has safeguards in place to prevent this from happening on our network and school-issued devices. We continue to strengthen our efforts by educating our students and establishing clear guidelines to ensure that these new technologies are used responsibly in our schools and beyond.\"\n\nThe district also says they can't comment on how many students are affected or any disciplinary actions.",

      "# [Classmates tried to use my Asian identity against me, but kung fu anchored me by Marvin Chan, for CBC First Person on 2024-05-22](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/asian-identity-kung-fu-art-1.7205015)\nThis First Person article is written by Marvin Chan, a singer-songwriter who divides his time between Regina and Toronto. For more information about First Person stories, see the FAQ.\n\n\"Let's see your kung fu, Jackie Chan.\"\n\nThis was the last thing I heard before being pushed into a circle of kids.\n\nI remember thinking, \"Do they really think all Chinese people know kung fu?\"\n\nThey just happened to pick one who did.\n\nMy most vivid elementary school memories in Regina during the 1990s were ones like these.\n\nMy teachers and principal were often confused. I was a quiet kid. I got good grades. I barely spoke and, when I did, I raised my hand first.\n\nBut then something like this would happen — someone would call me \"yellow\" or something else racist — I'd black out and end up back in the principal's office.\n\nMy mom put me in kung fu lessons in early elementary school. I learned how to kick before ever properly throwing a ball.\n\nThe specific style of kung fu I learned was called Bak Hsing Kwoon. This system was derived from a greater Kung Fu lineage called Choy Li Fut, which originated in the 1800s from southern China.\n\nMy sifu (teacher) was Henry Suen, a fourth-generation Bak Hsing Choy Li Fut grandmaster from Hong Kong. He also owned Hot Wok, one of Regina's only dim sum restaurants at the time.\n\nEvery Tuesday, my mom dropped my brother and me off to kung fu at the local legion and every Saturday, my parents drove us to Chinese school after dim sum.\n\nTuesdays were the best day of the week. Saturdays were the worst (except for dim sum).\n\nThroughout elementary school, I was the only Chinese kid in my grade. I felt more normal at kung fu and Chinese school where all the other kids looked like me.\n\nStill, I struggled in Chinese school. I could barely read.\n\nAt elementary school, I was invisible. At Chinese school, I was illiterate.\n\nBut at kung fu, Sifu Henry gave me something I couldn't find anywhere else.\n\nI wasn't an overly physical kid. I was more of a gamer than an athlete. I usually got picked last in gym class.\n\nBut kung fu was more than just physical self-defence. It was about defending myself culturally.\n\nWith kung fu, motion was language. I could express emotions through movement.\n\nBruce Lee explained in his 1971 interview with Pierre Berton that martial arts is a means for those who \"want to learn to express themselves through some movement\" and is \"in combative form, the art of expressing the human body.\"\n\nLISTEN: Marvin Chan talks to The Morning Edition about kung fu as a means of expression\n\nA time of little Asian representation\n\nGrowing up as a Chinese Cantonese and Thai Canadian on the Prairies was weird, especially during the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThere weren't Asian Canadians in films like there are now: no Simu Liu as Shang-Chi or Paul Sun-Hyung Lee in Star Wars.\n\nThere were no Asian cast shows winning Emmys like Beef or movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once winning Academy Awards.\n\nThere were no Asian artists in music such as Thuy or Blackpink at Coachella nor BTS or NewJeans on the Spotify playlists.\n\nSifu Henry taught first and second-generation Chinese kids to be proud of who they are.\n\nHe had famous one-liners like, \"No. 1 thing: don't get hurt.\" and taught concepts like how to \"rest while fighting.\"\n\nI realize now that these weren't just lessons about kung fu. They were lessons in perseverance and preservation for ourselves culturally.\n\nI realize now that my mom didn't even put my brother and me into kung fu for self-defence or even to exercise. My parents are academics. They hated finding me in the principal's office with more bruises or a black eye.\n\nMy mom wanted us in kung fu and Chinese school and around dim sum and Sifu Henry because it was the only way for us to connect to ourselves culturally, especially during the 1990s in the small-town Prairies.\n\nSifu Henry passed away while I was in university. Since then, I've trained in Muay Thai and jiu-jitsu but kung fu remains the foundation for my martial arts.\n\nSifu Henry gave me strength through kung fu to pursue all the art forms I followed, including becoming a singer-songwriter.\n\nKung fu not only gave me the means of surviving my childhood but it also allowed me to embrace myself today as an artist, a martial artist and a Chinese Cantonese and Thai Canadian.",
      "# [Fiji Primary School Classmates Reunite on Pacific Partnership 2023](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/457914/fiji-primary-school-classmates-reunite-pacific-partnership-2023)\nU.S. Navy Seaman Apprentice Etonia Malo and Royal New Zealand Air Force Leading Aircraftsman Adi Koro are living proof of the saying, “it’s a small world.” Classmates at Suva Primary in Fiji more than a decade ago, Malo and Koro are now serving together on Pacific Partnership 2023.\n\n“I was in the same class as his little sister. He was a grade above me,” said Koro. “My first day boarding the ship, I walked onto the brow and he was there working. I didn’t know he was in the U.S. Navy, had no idea. It was a good surprise.”\n\nKoro joined Pacific Partnership 2023 at the fourth mission stop in Suva as the Fijian Cultural Advisor.\n\n“I’m the Fijian Cultural Advisor. I advise the mission staff, mainly the Chief Protocol Officer, on what to do, what not to do, and what to expect when there are cultural happenings,” said Koro.\n\nGrowing up in Fiji, Koro learned about the Fijian culture from her dad.\n\n“Growing up, I was more in touch with the cultural side of things,” said Koro. “My dad would make sure we went to family events; make sure we were there to see the ways of the Fiji culture, like what women do and what the men do.”\n\nMalo is assigned to the Harpers Ferry-class amphibious dock landing ship USS Pearl Harbor (LSD 52) and has been with the ship since the start of the mission.\n\n“I’m an undesignated seaman, so I work with the [boatswain’s mates],” said Malo. “I am part of the ship’s crew, so we are supporting Pacific Partnership through going to outreach events, sporting events, and the concerts.”\n\nMalo joined the Navy after receiving his U.S. permanent resident card through the Diversity Visa Program.\n\n“Joining the Navy was a stepping stone for me,” said Malo. “I was unsure of what to do, so I joined the Navy to find my path and direct my future plans for the next five years.”\n\nWhile serving on Pacific Partnership, Malo has participated in a variety of outreach events at many of the mission stops.\n\n“I’ve done a lot of community outreach, getting to know the locals. That’s the main experience we get - not the sites or attractions - it’s interactions with the locals,” said Malo. “It’s given me a different perspective that’s opened my mind to other lifestyles and cultures.”\n\nIn Fiji, Koro attended many of the outreach events with mission staff and advised leadership on cultural practices.\n\nFor example, Koro explained what actions to take when at official ceremonies, such as if the mission commander is presented a whale’s tooth, or during happy celebrations when people bring baby powder and spread it on others’ faces. Ultimately, her role was to bridge the gap between multi-national cultural considerations and protocol.\n\nBoth Koro and Malo appreciated the opportunity to visit their homes in Fiji and to be around people from their hometown.\n\n“There’s a lot of new changes, but it was good to go home after seven years,” said Koro. “In New Zealand, the Fiji community is small. Coming back home, it’s nice to see Fijians everywhere.”\n\n“I took leave the first four days we were here,” said Malo. “My whole family still lives here - my parents and my sister - I’m the only one in the states.”\n\nKoro and Malo met up once again at the touch rugby game during the Fiji mission stop.\n\n“The rugby game was fun,” said Malo. “I got to teach some of my fellow shipmates the rules of the game, so it was quite fun.”\n\n“I didn’t know he played sports,” said Koro. “But it was obvious he plays by the way he played rugby.”\n\nBeing on the same mission with his primary school classmate, Malo feels a sense of Fijian community on the ship.\n\n“Before she was here, I spoke all English,” said Malo. “Now I get to speak my mother tongue and be more expressive in my mother tongue.”\n\nKoro is welcoming to the diversity of the ship and the chance to get to know more people from different cultures.\n\n“It’s been good coming on the ship and seeing a wide range of ethnicities,” said Koro. “I’m grateful to be here.”\n\nFor more information about Pacific Partnership, visit www.facebook.com/pacificpartnership, www.instagram.com/pacific_partnership/ or https://www.dvidshub.net/unit/C-LGWP.
