      "# [Careers & Open Positions](https://www.imaginepediatrics.org/careers)\nOur intervention\n\nWe provided an immediate virtual visit with the child and her mom, noting an infection in her eczema flare. Our provider prescribed a topical and oral antibiotic with additional steroid ointment to treat the flare and co-existing infection. We followed up with her mom that same evening and throughout the week to ensure the infection was clearing.\n\nOur impact\n\nThe patient was able to access a pediatrician right away despite previous difficulty finding a PCP. Her infection cleared, and her mom received ongoing support for managing her daughter’s chronic conditions.\n\nOur intervention\n\nWe engaged and enrolled the patient following the most recent ER visit and identified the lack of access to a neurologist. Our care team referred the patient’s family to a new in-network neurologist at an accessible distance from their home.\n\nOur impact\n\nThe patient avoided an unnecessary ER visit and hospitalization and gained access to necessary specialty care.\n\nOur intervention\n\nIn a video visit that same morning, our pediatrician helped determine that the new symptoms did not require emergency care. We connected with the child’s endocrinologist and, together, made a plan to pause hormone therapy and schedule an urgent follow-up endocrinology visit.\n\nOur impact\n\nThrough collaboration between the right providers, the patient and their mother found peace of mind and an immediate plan for follow-up care with the right specialist in a medically complex situation.",
