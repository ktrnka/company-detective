      "# [Frequently asked questions](https://www.imaginepediatrics.org/faq)\nWe are a pediatrician-led medical group. We provide 24/7 virtual-first care in the home for children and adolescents with special health care needs. Our multidisciplinary team is made up of doctors, nurses, social workers, and other clinical team members.\n\nâ\n\nWe know that parents and caregivers face many challenges as they care for their child. Thatâs why we are ready anytime of the day or night to help them get the high-quality care and support their child deserves.\n\nâ\n\nWe do not replace a childâs current doctors. We work with them to give children an extra layer of medical, behavioral, and social support. Our goal is to help kids avoid unnecessary emergency room visits and spend more time at home and in their communities.\n\nWhen a child is enrolled in our services, their parents and caregivers can call or message us anytime using our mobile app. We are ready to help 24/7. We will answer questions, get on a video call, or, in some cases, visit their home to diagnose and treat their child. If their child has an acute episode, we provide care and support right away, at any time of the day or night.\n\nâ\n\nWe work closely with parents and caregivers to support their child. We help with medication and equipment. We find specialists, set appointments, and complete paperwork. We can also help in times of mental health crisis if needed. And we can connect caregivers to other services that their child might need.\n\nâ\n\nWe support private duty nurses (PDNs) in the home. PDNs can contact us for extra help through the Imagine Pediatrics app. We can help them get a prior authorization, medication refills, or equipment support. We are also available to PDNs anytime they have a question or need a quick consultation.\n\nâ\n\nWith Imagine Pediatrics, caregivers and patients donât have to leave home to get care and support because our services are virtual. There is no cost for children who qualify. Our services are part of their existing health plan benefits.\n\nâ\n\nCurrently, we support patients in Texas and Florida.\n\nWe help expand the collective impact of care teams by providing more medical, behavioral, and social care in the home to children with special health care needs.\n\nâ\n\nWe aim to give care teams more peace of mind by giving our shared patients additional acute care coverage 24/7 â in particular during off work hours at night, over the weekend, and on holidays. When a child enrolls in our services, we contact their existing care team to introduce ourselves and answer any questions they have. After that, every time we provide care, we send an update to the childâs PCP and other doctors, so everyone knows about any care changes.\n\nâ\n\nFor private duty nurses (PDNs) in the home, we provide extra help through the Imagine Pediatrics app. We can help them get a prior authorization, medication refills, or equipment support. We are also available to PDNs anytime they have a question or need a quick consultation.\n\nâ\n\nThe care and support we provide is designed to improve the life and health of a child with special health care needs. So they can achieve better outcomes, and we can bring some relief and peace of mind to all those who care for them.\n\nWhen a child qualifies for our services, we call their caregiver to discuss eligibility. During that call, we describe who we are and what we do. We help them download our app and enroll their child. We also answer any questions they may have.\n\nâ\n\nCaregivers are welcome to call us at (833) 208-7770 to see if their child qualifies.\n\nParents and caregivers can expect to be heard and helped as they care for their child. Throughout the enrollment process, we listen closely to caregivers to learn all about their childâs needs. We do this so that anytime their child needs care, we can help immediately. After enrollment, our team of doctors, nurses, social workers, and other clinicians will be ready 24/7 to provide care and support. We help caregivers get referrals and medication refills. We also help with equipment repairs and replacements. All of our services are designed to improve the life and health of a child with special health care needs. So they can stay out of the hospital, and we can bring their caregivers some relief and peace of mind.\n\nYes. When a child enrolls in our services, they keep all their current doctors. We do not replace anyone on a childâs existing care team. We partner with their doctors to provide an extra layer of 24/7 care and support in the home. When a child we care for has a change in symptoms, we help parents and caregivers decide if their child can be cared for at home, if they should get an in-home visit from a member of our care team, or if they should be taken to the emergency room.\n\nâ\n\nWe also provide extra help to private duty nurses based in the home. We can help them get a prior authorization, medication refills, or equipment support. We are also available to them anytime they have a question or need a quick consultation.\n\nWe are different from member services at a health plan because we provide health care directly to children with special health care needs. We are a team of doctors, nurses, social workers, therapists, and other clinicians. We team up with a childâs current doctors to be sure that kids have continuous access to the care they need and deserve. We are ready day and night to help children and their caregivers in their home. We answer questions, perform virtual care visits, help with medication refills, equipment issues, appointment scheduling, and more. We are an extra layer of care and support. Our goal is to help kids avoid unnecessary ER visits so they can spend more time at home and in their community",

      "# Post ID 16muqot: Interest in Perfusion, but been told it's not a good idea with +18 score by [(grugregra, Reddit, 2023-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfusion/comments/16muqot/interest_in_perfusion_but_been_told_its_not_a/)\nHi! I'm currently a junior in college and am planning to apply to a couple of Perfusion schools next year. Just recently heard from a friend that she was advised to not get into the profession, reason being the job outlook is not great as they're doing more closed heart surgery? Idk how true this is? Kinda search up on the job outlook online, it does say it is in demand but that was from 2016....a lot of them were old posts. \n\n## Comment ID k1apw1o with +45 score by [(Diepokemonsters, Reddit, 2023-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfusion/comments/16muqot/interest_in_perfusion_but_been_told_its_not_a/k1apw1o/) (in reply to ID 16muqot):\nPerfusionists are in high demand and will be for the foreseeable future. There are currently way more jobs than workers. I've been a perfusionist for 9 years and have zero concerns that I can work for 20 more years. Open heart surgery isn't going away for increasingly older and sicker patients.\n\nThe catch is that you have to be willing to relocate. If you are attached to a particular city or state, you might have to wait 5-10 years to get there. \n\nThe other catch is that you have to be willing to take call. You will get calls in the middle of the night to do emergency surgery. Think carefully if that's a lifestyle you can commit to. The flip side is most perfusion jobs only have 20-30 hours of total work a week if they are properly staffed. \n\nSo if you are willing to apply across the country, and you are willing to take call, you will get lots of high paying offers. It's a fun, powerful, and meaningful career with a lot of responsibility. Hope that helps. Good luck!\n\n### Comment ID ktpo8az with +1 score by [(Rob_theBoy, Reddit, 2024-03-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfusion/comments/16muqot/interest_in_perfusion_but_been_told_its_not_a/ktpo8az/) (in reply to ID k1apw1o):\nhey Diepokemonsters since you are an experience perfusionist. I want to ask you something. I just finished getting my Associates degree and I been an anesthesia Tech for about 3 years and I seen what y'all do when I set up cases for CABG and it looks challenging, Fun and something I want to do. you think its smart to get my BSN (nursing degree) or get something else like a  health science degree to go straight to Perfusion school.  I already have 20+ hours shadowing and many more hours to come since I work in the OR.\n\n#### Comment ID ktxl02b with +2 score by [(Diepokemonsters, Reddit, 2024-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfusion/comments/16muqot/interest_in_perfusion_but_been_told_its_not_a/ktxl02b/) (in reply to ID ktpo8az):\nHi u/Rob_theBoy! I'm glad to hear you are interested in perfusion! Three years of being an anesthesia tech and already setting up bypass circuits is a great work history and will stand out on your applications!\n\nSome perfusion schools may require a 4 year degree, some may prefer it, and some may accept your associates degree. Check the program websites to make sure you are an eligible candidate. \n\nThat said, if you had good grades with your associate degree, I would apply directly to perfusion schools. In my opinion, there is no need for extra school (and school debt!) to pursue the career you actually want to practice in! \n\nBest of luck to you!\n\n### Comment ID lpgrp3k with +1 score by [(Ordinary-Weakness-54, Reddit, 2024-09-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfusion/comments/16muqot/interest_in_perfusion_but_been_told_its_not_a/lpgrp3k/) (in reply to ID k1apw1o):\nHey Diepokemonsters I am also a student of cardiac perfusion 3rd semester in university of Lahore. Everyone say that it's not a good career leave it and do find some other degrees . I have seen your motivating reply. Can you tell me the procedure what should I do after doing BS CPT. I want to go in UK for job. Can you tell me what are the requirements for doing perfusion job in UK and how can I get job easily after doing my bachelor. I'll be very thankful if you guide me in a better way.\n\n#### Comment ID lpiexch with +1 score by [(Diepokemonsters, Reddit, 2024-09-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfusion/comments/16muqot/interest_in_perfusion_but_been_told_its_not_a/lpiexch/) (in reply to ID lpgrp3k):\nHi u/Ordinary-Weakness-54,\n\nI would say it is a good career if you find a good team to work with! Congratulations on your hard work so far. Keep with it! \n\nSadly, I am not familiar with perfusion in the UK as I work and live in the USA. I do know they have strict residency requirements in the UK though, so get a work visa early and start the process for citizenship early if you are planning to live there long term. \n\nPerhaps you can make a new post on this subreddit asking for help from people in the UK? They will know know more about working and living in their country than I do. \n\nIn general for the job though, after 3 semesters you should know if you enjoy perfusion. If you find it interesting and think you can make a difference in cardiac surgery, follow your passion and don't listen to what anyone else says. Perfusion is challenging but very rewarding financially and in finding meaning.\n\nBest of luck!\n\n## Comment ID k1b057n with +32 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfusion/comments/16muqot/interest_in_perfusion_but_been_told_its_not_a/k1b057n/) (in reply to ID 16muqot):\nGuess who is still on standby by for off pump and perc cases… 🤪 go to perfusion school!\n\n## Comment ID k1bq5ky with +30 score by [(Celticusa, Reddit, 2023-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfusion/comments/16muqot/interest_in_perfusion_but_been_told_its_not_a/k1bq5ky/) (in reply to ID 16muqot):\nI,ll give you my perspective, been a Perfusionist for 40 years. I started in the early 1980's at a large teaching hospital. The new up and coming technology at that time was Balloon Angioplasty for the treatment of coronary artery disease. This technique was going to revolutionize the treatment of CAD, and make all Cardiac Surgeons and Perfusionists redundant. Yes it did have an impact, but as time and research has shown with its evolution into atherectomy, lasers, stents etc. in multi-vessel disease diabetic patients, surgery is the gold standard. Will that change maybe.\n\nWith the advent of Off-Pump CABG, catheter-based valve replacement and repair procedures, aortic repair, or any other catheter-based procedures performed in the Cath Lab, a proportion of patients are not best served by these procedures. Cath Lab based procedures in general need to have access to emergency surgery option and or standby, hence are performed at facilities with that in house. The longevity of some of these valves is still unknown, and many patients are being lulled into going for the least invasive option because its less scary, and we don't open your chest.\n\nSo, surgeons and Perfusionists are still needed, to bail out the Cardiologists, plus some procedures can only be repaired by performing surgery. To summarize, I don't see perfusionists disappearing for the forseeable future, our role and job may change and evolve with some of these technologies. There is also an ongoing retirement and I believe about 40-50% of perfusionists of my generation will leave in the next 5 years, of which I will be one, but for now, we are still needed, and will be for the next 30 years. The patients we currently see are younger, sicker, fatter, almost all have diabetes and other co-morbidities, and I don't see this trend decreasing, only increasing, as well as our increased longevity.\n\nThe other thing to bear in mind is this is a lifestyle, not 9 to 5 job, you will be stressed, you will miss important family events, you will have to perform when you are exhausted, you will be yelled at, you will have to get out of bed at 2am, you will work weekends, and you will have the satisfaction of knowing you have one of the coolest, most responsible, respected (has to be earned), and most satisfying and well paid jobs in the medical field, without being a Doctor\n\n### Comment ID k1wf2qx with +6 score by [(careerconfusion101, Reddit, 2023-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfusion/comments/16muqot/interest_in_perfusion_but_been_told_its_not_a/k1wf2qx/) (in reply to ID k1bq5ky):\nhow bad is the yelling part?

Then PCIs were gonna be the end of CABGs. Then TAVRs were gonna be the end of open valve repairs/replacements. OPCABs were supposed to be the death knell of our profession. Perfusionists will be around for a long time to come. People have been predicting the end of our specialty since at least the 80s, yet here we all are, more in-demand then ever. Even as healthier patients get less invasive therapies, they’ll live longer and become sicker, then surgery becomes an inevitability. Plus, our scope has increased dramatically since the 80s, with things like ECMO, VADs, HIPEC, etc. To paraphrase Mark Twain, “The report of our death has been grossly exaggerated.”\n\n### Comment ID k1dad6v with +3 score by [(cassieinva, Reddit, 2023-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfusion/comments/16muqot/interest_in_perfusion_but_been_told_its_not_a/k1dad6v/) (in reply to ID k1cfe8a):\nWell said.\n\n## Comment ID k1afgdp with +7 score by [(nonexistantgrill, Reddit, 2023-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfusion/comments/16muqot/interest_in_perfusion_but_been_told_its_not_a/k1afgdp/) (in reply to ID 16muqot):\nI'm only a few years out but in my experience, perfusionist are in demand.

BUT regardless of if you’re on pump, off pump, standby for TAVR/LEAD extraction there legally HAS to be a perfusionist around. Because when shit hits the fan you’re going old school and throwing them on bypass or ECMO. \n\nI also don’t imagine pediatrics having any hit from it all since the degree of defects can’t just be fixed with a catheter majority of the time. Maybe you could wait till the kid with an ASD was a little older and close it through device but far more defects will require a more invasive approach. Only down side is it’s a lot more attention to detail and after having kids of your own you get a lot more emotionally attached to the patients. \n\nI don’t really see the need for new perfusionists going anywhere too soon, a lot of perfusionists are retiring in the next decade so a lot more will be needed. The market will eventually flatten again since also a lot of young perfusionists are entering the field. Where it’ll mostly get interesting is when Specialty Care starts their school and takes a lot of applicants, they’re going to be paying all costs for school but you’d just have to work for them for a certain amount of time under contract once you graduate. \n\nBut no matter what, Perfusionists will have to be in the hospital and involved with the cases regardless of how invasive it may be. And once a hospital somewhere tries to cut corners and ends up being sued because a patient dies, every other hospital will ensure it won’t happen to them\n\n## Comment ID k1g51cf with +4 score by [(HuckleberryLatter593, Reddit, 2023-09-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfusion/comments/16muqot/interest_in_perfusion_but_been_told_its_not_a/k1g51cf/) (in reply to ID 16muqot):\nI am just  curious.

And all stated the same just as the post from \"Celticusa\" below.\n\nAt the same time they recognize the importance of not causing saturation/oversaturation.

They want money and as long as students will pay for it, they’ll continue to fund it. If schools cared about prospective job markets then they wouldn’t be graduating liberal art majors by the bus load. Like, how many women studies majors are needed on society? Yet here we are….. 20ish schools isn’t a lot but when you compare it to 3-5 years ago there was only 15-16 schools. So it’s increased 25-35%, roughly speaking. We’re now graduating 300 ccps in a profession of 3600. Basically 10% increase per year. \n\nYes I am using generalized numbers. Also, I enjoy the profession but it seems odd that people are so optimistic about perfusions future. Just because it had weathered the past, doesn’t\nMean that the profession won’t undergo another massive pay cut.\n\n## Comment ID k1bfyzn with +5 score by [(Megzyy40, Reddit, 2023-09-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfusion/comments/16muqot/interest_in_perfusion_but_been_told_its_not_a/k1bfyzn/) (in reply to ID 16muqot):\nToo many new schools.

It's sadly just a part of the gig.\n\nIt helps to remember that trolls generally will go for the lowest-hanging fruit that will get a response from you. They don't actually care. They just want the response; because positive or negative, attention is attention. That's what they're after.\n\nFat, old, young, female, anything other than white, wear glasses, ugly, bad skin, bad hair, annoying voice, birthmark, teeth, too skinny, annoying laugh... whatever they can see that's the shortest route to getting you to react. And of course, if none of those apply of course you must be gay. Whatever makes your day shitty and sad is what makes them feel a little better about themselves, because *someone acknowledged them as existing* and that they had a tiny measure of control.\n\nBest way to deal with it is to ignore them completely. Don't frown, don't smile, don't even stop talking if you can manage it. Don't acknowledge them ***at all***, just ban them without a word and continue as if they don't exist. Even bragging about banning them, they 'win' because you gave them that scrap of attention.\n\nSo don't. Erase them. Wipe them from your world.

We live and exist around people every day, and nobody goes through life without having negative interactions with people. We all have to learn to deal with those moments when they happen.

From childhood, whether actually true or not, I was labeled as sensitive by some of the people around me. Empathy and mentally putting yourself into other people's perspectives can be seen that way at times. Not doing things people try to force upon you can also be labeled as \"sensitive\" because you are not doing what they want. It's all labels. Just because someone directs negativity toward you doesn't mean their words have any weight or value in reality and your life.\n\nI've mostly done YouTube and over the years there were some really strange and extremely negative comments on occasion. Humans are... ahh, varied... for a better word, lol.\n\nThe worst I've had on Twitch so far hasn't been much, but I don't have a lot of viewership or interaction and what I stream most of the time is pretty niche. The worse was some type of racist person which I promptly blocked. The most recent thing I remember was someone commenting on not having enough layers in a video I was editing which was awkward to respond to a general statement like that. I didn't really get what they even meant at first because it totally depends on what a given project requires and what style of editing you prefer. I probably got a bit red in the face and there was a bit of an awkward silence as I thought.\n\nOne suggestion I can give is to separate yourself from comments directed at you before you even consider what they said. These people don't know you and only take in what they see in the moment or over a period of time watching. Even if a person does know you, it's not natural to direct negative feedback at someone without them asking for it, right? Having it happen a lot non-stop is not a natural human experience. So large successful streamers will learn to ignore it or use it for content. The reality is that negativity can garner responses more often than friendly chatting because of how human nature works, so attention seekers will use it for that reason too whether they mean it or not.\n\nThat's not to say there isn't any value from feedback, but I think learning to logically create a buffer of sorts is helpful and smart. Your stream isn't their content. Don't let your style be muffled by negative people or people that want to apply their preferences onto you. Also, it's your space so you can block individuals that are incessantly negative or for whatever reason you feel like.\n\n## Comment ID kpvxeoy with +1 score by [(BrianBlackGames, Reddit, 2024-02-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/1anuwaw/am_i_too_sensitive_for_content_creationgen/kpvxeoy/) (in reply to ID 1anuwaw):\nMy chat has a knack for bullying bullies out of my chat.

Get control of your emotions and don't let other people's action define your wellbeing for you.  \nIt takes work, and a lot of practice but it's healthier and necessary in the long run.

The great thing about it is that once you know your reason behind streaming, your channel is your canvas to do with as you please.\n\nThere are some hard truths to swallow with this, such as you can't please everyone. In today's world, there are so many different takes and views on things, and it boils down to what you want your channel to be?\n\nThere will always be haters and trolls, but on the flip side of that, if you keep your head up and ignore them and keep moving forward, you will also get super fans who LOVE your content and your vide that they will help keep it that way.\n\nThe haters and trolls come and go. Their words may linger, but they are no more. They don't see you for you since they don't know you.\n\nYou have many tools at your disposal, and one huge thing is..... Mods!\nThe keepers of the vibes, so to speak, lol\n\nI honestly can't even count how many times I've had people come in and try to say something negative about my gaming or my looks.

You will need to step out of your comfort zone at times, but that's how it works.\n\nYou got this!\n\nAlso, my apologies if I come off a bit blunt.

Your chat is your business and what you allow is your prerogative . You'll eventually have trolls show up and how you handle them can either decrease or increase the trolling. Freaking out is generally the best way to make sure they increase their trolling, ignoring and banning works well too. Trolls are looking for some kind of negative response because it gets them off or something. So giving them what they want is the worst thing you can do.   \n\n\nNow with that said the easiest way to toughen up is to take a long look at yourself in the mirror and figure out everything that a person might attack and just prepare for it.   \n\n\nSo for example I'm over 40, I'm obese, and I have a lazy eye. Pretty much any trolling I experience is in regards to those 3 things. Either I'm old, I'm fat, or I'm weird looking. I can't help my age, I could lose weight but don't really have the motivation to do so, and with my wonky eye I play into it. My channel mascot is a pug and all pugs have wonky eyes. I'm prepared though and if anyone makes reference to those 3 things I have comebacks in mind to counter them.   \n\n\nExamples:   \nPerson calls me old: The older the buck the stiffer the horn, also please ask your mom to stop calling me while I'm streaming.  \n\n\nPerson calls me fat: OMG, I'm fat?!?! Why hasn't anyone ever told me this before!?!?! Thank you generous bunch of numbers dude for letting me know this revealing fact about my life.   \n\n\nPerson makes reference to my wonky eye: Yeah my eyes were fine but your mom is so good in bed she knocked one out of sync.  \n\n\nThen the real fun part is watching my regulars rip the troll to shreds.\n\n## Comment ID kq6v2z6 with +1 score by [(efemmerelle, Reddit, 2024-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/1anuwaw/am_i_too_sensitive_for_content_creationgen/kq6v2z6/) (in reply to ID 1anuwaw):\nI literally crossdress and play games on my twitch, to basically no viewers and often times I get trolled or harassed.

Have you had bad performance reviews? I’m really sorry you have had these problems and encourage you not to give up. I graduated at 36 years old, but I had experience in other fields before nursing that I used to sell myself. My first job was step down unit or PCU, then clinical manager of an ER a year and a half later, which became manager. I managed PCU, went back to bedside in ICU, did Telemedicine for ICU, I travel nursed in ICU and Case Management. With the exception of management, I have always been one of the oldest on the units where I was working. I am going to be SIXTY next month, a big number indeed. I’m currently changing jobs, by my choice and I am returning to ICU. When applying, I do not lead with my age. Employers can get in HUGE trouble if they ask your age, so I hope that isn’t happening to you. I have turned down multiple offers at this point. \n\nMy suggestions: \n1. Consider different employers (you don’t have to stay at they same place and you will increase your pay by moving)\n2. Get great references (If you are buddies with a Nurse Practitioner or Doctor it helps, and the good ones want to help you). \n3. Have a resume (don’t include anything that reveals your age, no high school, no birthdate, etc)\n4. Do you have a BSN? I don’t and if you don’t, make clear you are willing to return to school to obtain.\n5. Look at job description you are applying for and identify things you are currently doing that you can add to your cover letter and resume. \n6. A lot of places use automatic screening that searches for keywords, so make sure you pull some from the job description.\n\n#### Comment ID io3y1xl with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/xbjb64/age_discrimination/io3y1xl/) (in reply to ID io3ezwh):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID io5cllf with +2 score by [(TiredNurse111, Reddit, 2022-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/xbjb64/age_discrimination/io5cllf/) (in reply to ID io0q3hp):\nI think you might find more opportunities now than you did before.

The running theory at work among older nurses is that it's cheaper to employ the younger new grad, so they run off the older nurses.\n\n## Comment ID io2me9d with +4 score by [(teeann929, Reddit, 2022-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/xbjb64/age_discrimination/io2me9d/) (in reply to ID xbjb64):\nIn 61 and at the bedside in L&D.

I float and usually see a couple of older nurses like me on every floor but others take management positions or go to insurance companies or nurse navigator jobs . I don’t think that many young nurses want to be at the bedside they mostly do NP after a couple years and leave. I don’t think you will have any trouble getting a job\n\n## Comment ID io454m2 with +2 score by [(supermomfake, Reddit, 2022-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/xbjb64/age_discrimination/io454m2/) (in reply to ID xbjb64):\nI’m 37 and ran away from bedside pretty quickly.

It is back breaking work. Have you ever had to lift and turn a pregnant woman who is numb with an epidural? \n2 years ago I became a lactation consultant. Now I have to only lift babies. I plan to work till I’m 72, possibly till 75. My back is pretty much shot and there’s no way I could do L&D until then.\nI have worked with many older nurses in L&D though.\n\n### Comment ID io5hkhi with +1 score by [(UnicornDeco, Reddit, 2022-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/xbjb64/age_discrimination/io5hkhi/) (in reply to ID io4v1ug):\nWhy do you have to turn a pregnant woman with an epidural? Wouldn't they be in active labor by then? Of course, I can only go by my own birth experience. I didn't get an epidural until I had been in labor for hours and hours and ended up having an emergency c-section (had to be put completely under for that). I think I would like working mother/baby, but I can't be sure.\n\n#### Comment ID io5j2t1 with +2 score by [(Firm_Intention1068, Reddit, 2022-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/xbjb64/age_discrimination/io5j2t1/) (in reply to ID io5hkhi):\nWomen can get epidurals before active labor in certain circumstances. When a baby's heart rate goes into a dangerous beat, the first thing for intrauterine resuscitation is to turn the mom. If she's too numb to turn herself, we have to do it for her. Sometimes you try multiple positions before you get one that makes the baby's heart come back up to a normal baseline. And if the best position for the baby is for the mom to be in knee chest position and she's very numb, you might end up physically supporting her in that position for awhile. \n\nSome of the units I've worked in had no teamwork and you were on your own in situations like that. Fortunately, for the last 8 years I've been in a unit with great teamwork. \n\nWorking mother/baby is different than working L&D. Mother/baby is much less physically demanding. I've known a few L&D nurses who go to strictly mother/baby when they get older because it's easier physically in most instances.\n\n## Comment ID io5a0xw with +2 score by [(ConnieTxRN, Reddit, 2022-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/xbjb64/age_discrimination/io5a0xw/) (in reply to ID xbjb64):\nI’m 46 and have coworkers older than myself. I’m an RN and have worked labor and delivery pretty much since I got my degree. However, I’m currently back in school trying to get my MSN and move away from bedside. I definitely don’t want to be in my 60’s working the floor 12+ hours. The last decade has already taken its toll on me. Nursing is HARD on us in many ways.\n\n## Comment ID io5kw7r with +2 score by [(oh_my24, Reddit, 2022-09-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/xbjb64/age_discrimination/io5kw7r/) (in reply to ID xbjb64):\nFirst, I went back to school to become a nurse at 47. I'm now 55.  During Covid, a lot of older nurses retired, especially those that worked in bedside / hospital settings. Secondly, many nurses who have been working a long time move into other specialty areas of the hospitals and clinics where you don't see them as much, for both the hours and for the better pay with experience. Finally, your age doesn't make you a good nurse or a bad nurse. If you are going into nursing because, as an adult, you know yourself and know what you want to do with your life, you do have an advantage over SOME, not all, newer nurses who barely know themselves as adults much less what they want to do with their life.  Hey, I was an accountant right out of college.  I frigin hate accounting now lol. So follow your heart, because if you're happy at what you do, you'll be good at it and you'll be successful.  Good luck!!!\n\n### Comment ID j66t5sb with +1 score by [(Catmom2004, Reddit, 2023-01-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/xbjb64/age_discrimination/j66t5sb/) (in reply to ID io5kw7r):\n>I was an accountant right out of college.

They looked as early as possible for moves away from acute hospital wards to community or outpatients where the physical load is more chill.\n\nHere in the uk its def worth it to go in to the profession a bit older as you get the nhs pension etc. It also probably gives you more perspective and better life experience to weather the hard times idk. I wish you all the best. \n\nIf you want it, go for it.\n\n## Comment ID io0eq1g with +2 score by [(Anthrax4breakfast, Reddit, 2022-09-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/xbjb64/age_discrimination/io0eq1g/) (in reply to ID xbjb64):\nI have worked with plenty of nurses in the ED that are over 60.

      "# [Imagine Pediatrics Launches First-Of-Its-Kind Virtual Care Model for Children with Medical Complexity and Special Health Care Needs by Business Wire on 2023-11-29](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/imagine-pediatrics-launches-first-kind-140000673.html)\nUnique care model delivers medical, behavioral, and social care and support in the home 24/7 in collaboration with a child’s caregivers and existing health care providers\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn., November 29, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Imagine Pediatrics, a multidisciplinary, pediatrician-led medical group that surrounds children with medical complexity and special health care needs with 24/7 virtual-first care and support in the home, has launched in Texas and Florida and currently serves more than 20,000 children and families. In partnership with health plans, Imagine Pediatrics uses a first-of-its-kind value-based, population health payment model to bring 24/7 medical, behavioral, and social care and support to Medicaid-eligible patients – in collaboration with caregivers, providers, and community resources. The organization’s services come at no additional cost for patients and caregivers because they are part of a child’s existing health plan benefits. The Imagine Pediatrics approach improves access to high-quality care and helps children and their families spend less time in the hospital and more time at home and in their communities.\n\nThe medical group’s team of English- and Spanish-speaking doctors, nurses, social workers, therapists, care team assistants, and other clinicians do not replace a child’s existing care team or medical home. Instead, they collaborate with providers to help reinforce existing care plans and address acute needs virtually when a child’s primary care team and specialists are unavailable. This extra layer of support helps ensure these children and their families get continuous care and support they need to avoid unnecessary trips to the emergency room and urgent care.\n\n\"We are on a mission to reimagine pediatric health care together with caregivers, clinicians, health plans, and community resources,\" said George Boghos, CEO, Imagine Pediatrics. \"We know we can’t solve every challenge in the lives of our patients, but we can work tirelessly to give them, their families, and their clinicians the extra layer of help they need, right when they need it. We’re honored to be able to make a meaningful difference for so many kids and families, and have the opportunity to partner with visionary health care organizations that know this better approach to pediatric care is within reach.\"\n\nIn its first 10 months of supporting children and their caregivers, Imagine Pediatrics is already demonstrating measurable impact in changing pediatric health outcomes and bending financial curves. The team has conducted more than 50,000 care interactions – including virtual and in-person visits and secure digital messages through the Imagine Pediatrics™ Mobile App – which have led to a 15% reduction in inpatient admissions and 20% reduction in total cost of care among engaged patients. The most prevalent patient conditions include asthma, cardiovascular disorders, ADHD, anxiety, and technology dependence (e.g., children who require a gastrostomy tube or ventilator).",
      "# [Frequently asked questions](https://www.imaginepediatrics.org/faq)\nWe are a pediatrician-led medical group. We provide 24/7 virtual-first care in the home for children and adolescents with special health care needs. Our multidisciplinary team is made up of doctors, nurses, social workers, and other clinical team members.\n\nâ\n\nWe know that parents and caregivers face many challenges as they care for their child. Thatâs why we are ready anytime of the day or night to help them get the high-quality care and support their child deserves.\n\nâ\n\nWe do not replace a childâs current doctors. We work with them to give children an extra layer of medical, behavioral, and social support. Our goal is to help kids avoid unnecessary emergency room visits and spend more time at home and in their communities.\n\nWhen a child is enrolled in our services, their parents and caregivers can call or message us anytime using our mobile app. We are ready to help 24/7. We will answer questions, get on a video call, or, in some cases, visit their home to diagnose and treat their child. If their child has an acute episode, we provide care and support right away, at any time of the day or night.\n\nâ\n\nWe work closely with parents and caregivers to support their child. We help with medication and equipment. We find specialists, set appointments, and complete paperwork. We can also help in times of mental health crisis if needed. And we can connect caregivers to other services that their child might need.\n\nâ\n\nWe support private duty nurses (PDNs) in the home. PDNs can contact us for extra help through the Imagine Pediatrics app. We can help them get a prior authorization, medication refills, or equipment support. We are also available to PDNs anytime they have a question or need a quick consultation.\n\nâ\n\nWith Imagine Pediatrics, caregivers and patients donât have to leave home to get care and support because our services are virtual. There is no cost for children who qualify. Our services are part of their existing health plan benefits.\n\nâ\n\nCurrently, we support patients in Texas and Florida.\n\nWe help expand the collective impact of care teams by providing more medical, behavioral, and social care in the home to children with special health care needs.\n\nâ\n\nWe aim to give care teams more peace of mind by giving our shared patients additional acute care coverage 24/7 â in particular during off work hours at night, over the weekend, and on holidays. When a child enrolls in our services, we contact their existing care team to introduce ourselves and answer any questions they have. After that, every time we provide care, we send an update to the childâs PCP and other doctors, so everyone knows about any care changes.\n\nâ\n\nFor private duty nurses (PDNs) in the home, we provide extra help through the Imagine Pediatrics app. We can help them get a prior authorization, medication refills, or equipment support. We are also available to PDNs anytime they have a question or need a quick consultation.\n\nâ\n\nThe care and support we provide is designed to improve the life and health of a child with special health care needs. So they can achieve better outcomes, and we can bring some relief and peace of mind to all those who care for them.\n\nWhen a child qualifies for our services, we call their caregiver to discuss eligibility. During that call, we describe who we are and what we do. We help them download our app and enroll their child. We also answer any questions they may have.\n\nâ\n\nCaregivers are welcome to call us at (833) 208-7770 to see if their child qualifies.\n\nParents and caregivers can expect to be heard and helped as they care for their child. Throughout the enrollment process, we listen closely to caregivers to learn all about their childâs needs. We do this so that anytime their child needs care, we can help immediately. After enrollment, our team of doctors, nurses, social workers, and other clinicians will be ready 24/7 to provide care and support. We help caregivers get referrals and medication refills. We also help with equipment repairs and replacements. All of our services are designed to improve the life and health of a child with special health care needs. So they can stay out of the hospital, and we can bring their caregivers some relief and peace of mind.\n\nYes. When a child enrolls in our services, they keep all their current doctors. We do not replace anyone on a childâs existing care team. We partner with their doctors to provide an extra layer of 24/7 care and support in the home. When a child we care for has a change in symptoms, we help parents and caregivers decide if their child can be cared for at home, if they should get an in-home visit from a member of our care team, or if they should be taken to the emergency room.\n\nâ\n\nWe also provide extra help to private duty nurses based in the home. We can help them get a prior authorization, medication refills, or equipment support. We are also available to them anytime they have a question or need a quick consultation.\n\nWe are different from member services at a health plan because we provide health care directly to children with special health care needs. We are a team of doctors, nurses, social workers, therapists, and other clinicians. We team up with a childâs current doctors to be sure that kids have continuous access to the care they need and deserve. We are ready day and night to help children and their caregivers in their home. We answer questions, perform virtual care visits, help with medication refills, equipment issues, appointment scheduling, and more. We are an extra layer of care and support. Our goal is to help kids avoid unnecessary ER visits so they can spend more time at home and in their community",
      "# [Q&A: Imagine Pediatrics CEO George Boghos by David Raths on 2023-12-19](https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/population-health-management/complex-care/article/53080968/qa-imagine-pediatrics-ceo-george-boghos)\nA Nashville-based medical group called Imagine Pediatrics is partnering with health plans on a value-based payment model that brings 24/7 medical, behavioral, and social care and support into the homes of Medicaid-eligible children with medical complexity and special healthcare needs. The company’s CEO, George Boghos, M.B.A., recently sat down with Healthcare Innovation to describe the problem his company was formed to solve.\n\nPrior to joining Imagine Pediatrics 14 months ago, Boghos co-founded and led AIM Clinics, which delivered evidence-based applied behavioral analysis services to children with autism and their families who are from communities that experience health inequity.\n\nHealthcare Innovation: Could you talk about some of the access issues in pediatrics that your company is working to solve?\n\nBoghos: Pediatrics generally is one of the last places for innovation in healthcare. My mother is a pediatrician, so I've grown around pediatrics my whole life. My observation is that pediatrics hasn't evolved one iota since I remember my mom practicing. It’s set up well to serve kids who are generally healthy. You go to a pediatrician a few times a year and you're spending maybe 10 minutes with your pediatrician, and that works for most kids. Who it doesn't work for is kids with chronic complex medical conditions. What that's led to is children and their families utilizing the emergency room at a very, very high rate – and unfortunately oftentimes being admitted to the hospital for completely preventable reasons, because they've got nowhere else to go.\n\nWhat we are saying is, let's wrap around kids with medical complexities and their families a 24/7 virtual first, in-home care model by complex care pediatricians, by nurse practitioners, by therapists, dietitians, paramedics, and social workers — a full interdisciplinary care team that is really investing time to get to know these kids and their caregivers, and catch things preventatively through daily or weekly touch points, but also be there 24/7 for these families when they need the support. So in a nutshell that is what we are here to do.\n\nHCI: What kinds of conditions do these children tend to have?\n\nBoghos: It is the 1 to 2 percent of kids who have these complex chronic medical conditions such as severe unmanaged asthma or diabetes, cystic fibrosis, cerebral palsy, and they often have mental health comorbidities to go along with that. So that's who we're trying to solve this access problem for.\n\nHCI: And what is the business model? Do you partner with payers?\n\nBoghos: The way we do it is an entirely value-based population health model. We partner with Medicaid managed care organizations. We take full risk on the total cost of care for these children who qualify into our program, and we are here to manage their entire experience and care journey. We're not replacing anybody that they're working with. Our kids have PCPs. They've got specialists. They've got a ton of support, but we are there to fill the gaps. And our primary aim is to keep kids healthier and happier in their homes and out of the hospital when they don't need to be there.\n\nHCI: You're explaining that this supplements but doesn't replace their existing doctors. But do your providers need to coordinate care with those traditional doctors they already have — and how is that information about what Imagine has done get shared with the child's regular doctor's office and vice versa, so that everyone is on the same page?\n\nBoghos: That is a crucial point, because a lot our kids and families have five to 10 different healthcare providers involved in their care, and the last thing we want to do is be an extra layer in that journey and complicate things further. So we've invested a ton in our technology backbone. We work with our families through our patient app. We've got a population health tool that we've developed internally. We utilize an EMR and we are plugged into health information exchanges in the markets we're in. We’ve got ad-hoc one-on-one data integrations and connections with the big providers, pediatrics groups and complex care clinics where we're practicing. We are sharing that data on a daily basis. Whenever we've got an encounter with a child where we're looking at the care plan that their specialists or pediatrician developed, we are consulting with that pediatrician, and we are sharing information so everybody's in the loop.\n\nHCI: I read that your company is working in Florida and Texas currently. Can you name a couple of the managed care organizations you work with?\n\nBoghos: We are working with Superior Health Plan, which is Centene’s managed care plan in Texas, as well as UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Texas and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of Florida.\n\nHCI: Is there a particular reason you are in those two states first?\n\nBoghos: There's a lot that goes into it. A lot of the value we bring to our plan partners is helping them innovate and solve a need for a population that's difficult to manage historically. So it's based on states where the plans have had difficulty caring for children with medical complexity, and those states rose to the top. Secondarily, we become, an important part of the differentiation in the market for health plan partners, because they're looking to win bids or expand their market share in those states, and this could become an important differentiator for them.\n\nHCI: Do you expect that in 2024 you'll expand and scale up into other states?\n\nBoghos: Yes, that is our plan. We've got a lot of conversations going on with a variety of health plan partners in Texas and Florida, as well as in a variety of other states. Our goal is to be in a couple more states next year.\n\nHCI: It seems like sometimes startup companies have a chicken and egg problem where a payer would want to see proof of quality and ROI before agreeing to a partnership, but it's challenging to get there when you don't have that initial contract. How do you show them the value of it before you've actually done it with an organization of that size?\n\nBoghos: In two ways. One is that part of our founding team had done this very thing. We're talking about a virtual-first, high-touch model for children with medical complexities within a hospital system in the Midwest, and they saw great results doing it. Not only in terms of the satisfaction in the engagement of the families, but also in terms of reducing dramatically the unnecessary emergency room and hospital visits. So we had proof and data points, and published work being done. But more importantly, because the model is value-based in nature, we are truly putting our money where our mouth is. We are taking full risk. If we're not able to deliver outcomes, in terms of improvement on quality measures and preventing unnecessary hospital visits and reducing costs, the plan is no worse off. So that's the beauty of a full-risk model. Some of the plans are willing to trust us with that because they know we're perfectly aligned in doing the right thing for the patients.\n\nHCI: Did Imagine get venture capital investment to start up?\n\nBoghos: We were founded out of a group called Rubicon Founders, which is a Nashville-based venture incubator group made up of very experienced healthcare entrepreneurs and operators, who are trying to solve big problems in healthcare primarily through value-based care models.\n\nHCI: Could you talk about any results you've seen early on in working with these managed care organizations?\n\nBoghos: We’re still early. We launched with our first plan partner in January of 2023. What we've been able to accomplish is a pretty high engagement rate of the population we're serving. So we're currently taking on risk on close to 20,000 patients across those two states, Texas and Florida. We've been able to engage a very large percentage of them in a pretty short period of time. We touch base with our families, on average, about four times per month. That's anything from a chat on our app to a virtual visit to an in-home visit. We've done north of 50,000 patient interactions just in the first 11 months.\n\nMore importantly, we've got early claims results, so we're tracking healthcare claims data post-engagement with Imagine versus pre-engagement, and what we're seeing is approximately a 15 percent reduction in impatient volume, and about a 20 percent reduction in the total cost of care for these families, primarily driven by prevention of unnecessary emergency department visits, which oftentimes turn into lengthy admissions into the hospital.\n\nHCI: Is one of the challenges finding the clinical teams to support scaling this up?\n\nBoghos: I thought it would be our biggest challenge, but I've been pleasantly surprised with how well we've been able to attract really amazing teammates here. And a big part of the reason is this is very different from anything in pediatrics, right. We've been able to attract awesome teammates out of the PICU or NICU in a hospital or out of traditional pediatrics practices who really are yearning for the opportunity to develop very, very long-term, deep relationships with families and caregivers in a virtual-first model where they're really able to drive impact. Instead of a transactional type of relationship in a hospital where you're seeing a family at their worst, and then they're discharged, and you don't see them again, it's a really nice value for our care teams to be able to care for these families on a longitudinal basis and form those really, really deep relationships where you're not constrained by time limits of the 10-minute appointments.\n\nThe other beauty of our model is because it's virtual first, we are serving kids in very rural areas as well. We're able to have a team that's based in Houston serve children across the entire state of Texas, for example. So in terms of improving access and health equity, but also allowing us to hire the right talent and the best talent and be able to serve kids and not necessarily within driving distance is a really nice way for us to scale.\n\nHCI: Do you think these virtual-first models are going to continue to evolve and be highlighted as ways to address shortages and target resources at patients who traditionally are underserved?",

      "# [Diagnosis for 6.5.24: Checking the pulse of Florida health care news and policy by Christine Jordan Sexton on 2024-06-05](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/678137-diagnosis-for-6-5-24-checking-the-pulse-of-florida-health-care-news-and-policy/)\nWelcome back to Diagnosis, a vertical that focuses on the crossroads of health care policy and politics.\n\n—15 days—\n\nA Florida circuit court judge is giving state economists up to 15 days to come up with a new description for the abortion access amendment that will be on the November ballot.\n\nWhen voters go to the polls they will see a financial impact statement alongside the citizen initiative that if approved would guarantee access to abortion up to the point of viability. The amendment would supersede Florida’s current six-week abortion ban.\n\nThe group that is sponsoring the amendment — Floridians Protecting Freedom — challenged the wording of the impact statement that had been previously drawn up by members of an impact conference.\n\nThat statement was worked on and released months prior to the Florida Supreme Court decision that triggered the current six-week ban. It also mentioned a previous 15-week ban that is no longer in effect and how additional litigation was possible. In the end, economists said because of several outcomes they could not determine if the measure would have any impact on state or local revenues.\n\nJudge John C. Cooper, however, concluded on Wednesday that the statement was “inaccurate, ambiguous, misleading, unclear and confusing” and should be redone before it goes on the ballot.\n\nCooper made it clear he was not directing the impact conference, which is made up of staff from the Legislature and the Governor’s office and the Office of Economic and Demographic Research, exactly what to say but said it needed to reflect the current status of abortion laws in Florida.\n\nCooper added that he thought it was “speculative” to suggest that an amendment would trigger additional lawsuits or that legislators would pass something in response.\n\n“The parameters should be on what the law is now,” Cooper told lawyers from the bench.\n\nThe ruling by Cooper followed a hearing that lasted several hours. Much of the hearing was not centered on the wording of the impact statement but whether or not Cooper had jurisdiction to hear the case and whether local election supervisors should be part of the litigation. Cooper agreed to dismiss the counts of the lawsuit that were directed at election supervisors.\n\nLawyers representing the Department of State did not argue over the wording of the impact statement but did question whether the case could be considered by Cooper.\n\nThe 15-day timeline for economists to redo the financial impact statement will start once a written order is issued. That will likely occur on Monday, Cooper said. It’s not clear if the state will appeal the decision.\n\n___\n\nI welcome your feedback, questions and especially your tips. You can email me at [email protected] or call me at 850-251-2317.\n\n— Unintended consequences —\n\nThe Florida Board of Medicine returns to Tallahassee this week for a two-day board meeting.\n\nDay one kicks off Thursday with two BOM Committee meetings and two joint committee meetings between the BOM and the Board of Osteopathic Medicine, a sister board with authority over osteopathic physicians.\n\nPhysicians and entities that own medical centers are interested in the new financial responsibility requirements for clinics where gluteal fat grafting procedures (Brazilian butt lifts) are performed.\n\nYet it doesn’t appear on any of the agendas.\n\nThe mandate, contained in HB 1561, went into effect May 13, which is when the Governor signed the bill into law.\n\nAnother piece of legislation, SB 1600 by Sen. Jay Collins, also is on the radars of Florida doctors and professional health care licensing associations.\n\nAt press time the bill had not been sent to the Governor. It has a July 1 effective date.\n\nThe bill creates new statutes spelling out the requirements that health care practitioners, including medical doctors, must meet to qualify for licensure by endorsement. The bill repeals existing law authorizing the BOM to approve licensure applications by endorsement. The bill specifically precludes the BOM from licensing physicians who: have a complaint, an allegation or an investigation pending before a licensing entity in another state or territory; have been convicted of or pled nolo contendere to, regardless of adjudication, any felony or misdemeanor related to the practice of a health care profession; have had their license revoked or suspended by another state; have voluntarily surrendered any license in lieu of having disciplinary action taken against the license; or have been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank, which includes medical malpractice settlements.\n\nSB 1600 eliminates the section of the statute regarding licensure by endorsement and creates a new universal endorsement statute that applies to medical doctors and a dozen-plus other medical professionals.\n\nSome board members have expressed concerns with the legislation given that the much touted Live Healthy initiative, SB 7016 — which was signed by the Governor last month — makes it easier for internationally trained physicians to get licensed in Florida. The centerpiece of Senate President Kathleen Passidono’s Live Healthy initiative, SB 7016 allows internationally trained physicians to be licensed by endorsement so long as they graduate from World Health Organization-recognized medical schools and complete international medical residencies that are “substantially similar” to those endorsed by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.\n\nInternationally trained physicians with medical malpractice settlements or who have a pending complaint allegation or investigation aren’t precluded from the endorsement path.\n\nSome BOM members sounded off about the issue at the board’s last meeting.\n\n“In the totality of the Legislative Session, we are making it easier for foreign medical graduates to practice in the state of Florida, but we are making it impossible for people who are American doctors who had any lawsuit or a DUI 30 years ago or whatever else to have any mechanism to be licensed in the state of Florida,” said Wesley Chapel dermatologist Amy Derick.\n\nFormer BOM Chair and Winter Haven physician David Diamond said at the time he thought the BOM “should go on record.”\n\n“Although the intent was the best intentions, the repercussions of this will be detrimental to the people of the state of Florida. The whole purpose of this exercise was to minimize barriers for licensure and it’s having the perverse opposite effect,” he said.\n\n— Is it decided or not? —\n\nThe Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) has “closed” the Medicaid Dental invitation to negotiate but has not published the names of the bidders it intends to ink six-year contracts with.\n\nThe timeline for the ITN shows that AHCA anticipated announcing the winning bidders on April 29.\n\nThe ITN was closed on May 17.\n\nFlorida Politics reviewed the MyFloridaMarketPlace (MFMP) procurement website, the Florida Administrative Register, published Medicaid notices, and AHCA press releases for announcement of notice of intent to award the dental contracts but could not find a published notice.\n\nFlorida Politics earlier this week requested the notice of intent to award the contract but the state did not provide notice by deadline.\n\nAHCA issued three invitations to negotiate Medicaid services, one for dental services; one a pilot project to provide care in a managed care setting to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities; and one for the state’s managed medical assistance and long term care programs.\n\nAHCA closed the statewide Medicaid managed care ITN on April 17, 72 business hours after posting its notice of intent to award. Likewise, AHCA closed the ITN for the pilot program on Feb. 14, 72 business hours after posting its notice of intent to award.\n\n— Hearing scheduled —\n\nFlorida’s lawsuit challenging new federal health care rules dealing with gender affirming care is getting its first major hearing later this month.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Jung, the same judge who last week tossed out (without prejudice) Florida’s lawsuit challenging federal health care rules dealing with children’s health insurance, has scheduled a June 21 hearing on the case.\n\nAt that hearing, Jung will weigh Florida’s request to temporarily block new rules for federally-funded health care programs such as Medicaid. The rules bar discrimination by sex but include gender identity and sexual orientation in the definition. Attorney General Ashley Moody has asserted the new rules conflict with existing state laws on puberty blockers and surgery dealing with gender transition. Florida, along with the Catholic Medical Association, first filed its lawsuit in early May.\n\nThe state is seeking a preliminary injunction while the case moves ahead. In a mid-May court filing, lawyers for the state argued that the Affordable Care Act does not grant authority to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to put in place the new rules as the department contends.\n\n“The rules will also impose immediate and irreparable harm on plaintiffs by forcing them to incur irrecoverable costs and by unlawfully pressuring Florida to surrender its sovereign interests,” states the court filing.\n\nHHS officials, who have not yet filed a response to Florida’s lawsuit, defended the rules as a way to prevent discrimination when they were first announced.\n\nHHS Secretary Xavier Becerra called them a “giant step forward for this country toward a more equitable and inclusive health care system, and means that Americans across the country now have a clear way to act on their rights against discrimination when they go to the doctor, talk with their health plan, or engage with health programs run by HHS.”\n\n— Bankruptcy, but no layoffs? —\n\nSteward Health Care, which operates eight Florida hospitals, filed for bankruptcy last month but its Chief Strategy Officer, Rubén José King-Shaw Jr., told Florida Politics no one will lose their job.\n\n“We have made no plans to lay off anyone,” King-Shaw, a former AHCA Secretary, told Florida Politics. “We have no plans for that.”\n\nThe Dallas-based company in May filed for protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.\n\nKing-Shaw was in Tallahassee for two days last month, in part to attend a reunion of AHCA Secretaries held at current secretary Jason Weida’s home.\n\nSteward operates Coral Gables Hospital, Hialeah Hospital, North Shore Medical Center and Palmetto General Hospital in Miami-Dade County; Florida Medical Center in Broward; Melbourne Regional Medical Center and Rockledge Regional Medical Center in Brevard; and Sebastian River Medical Center in Indian River.\n\nSteward acquired the Miami-Dade and Broward hospitals from Tenet Healthcare in 2021.\n\n“Steward does not expect any interruptions in its day-to-day operations, which will continue in the ordinary course throughout the Chapter 11 process,” the company said in a written statement. “Steward’s hospitals, medical centers and physician’s offices are open and continuing to serve patients and the broader community and our commitment to our employees will not change.”\n\nThe company also has hospitals in Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.\n\nSteward’s troubles in Massachusetts have drawn the ire of top political figures including U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey, who have said the company’s previous private equity owners “sold (Steward) for parts” and “walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars.”\n\nDr. Ralph de la Torre said in a statement that in seeking bankruptcy protections, Steward will be better positioned to “responsibly transition ownership of its Massachusetts-based hospitals, keep all of its hospitals open to treat patients, and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities.”\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this reporting.\n\n— RULES —\n\n—The Florida Board of Nursing process amending Rule 64B9-15.0025 to clarify responsibilities for education providers and course instructors.

The annual event gives FHCA and FALA association members the ability to discuss with members of Congress the long term care industry’s legislative priorities.\n\nMore than 30 FHCA and FALA members met with Florida’s U.S. Senators and their staff to advocate on behalf of the industry. The FHCA and the FALA top priority is blocking a new federal staffing mandate for nursing homes.\n\nThe groups claim that the increase in staffing horus is an unfunded mandate on the long term care industry and will adversely impact Florida nursing homes. Nearly 75% of Florida’s nursing centers cannot currently meet requirements. More than 3,800 additional nurses and nurses’ aides would need to be hired to meet the staffing requirements, which will cost facilities an additional $226 million per year.\n\n“In light of the federal staffing mandate, it is more important than ever to meet with our lawmakers and advocate on behalf of our seniors and caregivers,” said Emmett Reed, CEO of FHCA. “Protecting access to care must be a priority, and we look forward to meeting with members of our Congressional delegation and engaging in discussions on how our leaders in Washington can better support our growing elderly population and those who care for them.”\n\nBijou Ikli, CEO of the Florida Assisted Living Association said: “Assisted living providers continue to struggle with workforce shortages, and a staffing mandate on nursing homes will have a ripple effect across the entire long-term care continuum,” said “Our assisted living facilities are still struggling to return their pre-pandemic workforce levels, and this mandate threatens to reduce the available pool of caregivers that our providers depend on to meet the quality care needs of their residents.”\n\n—The Florida Dental Association Foundation (FDA Foundation) hosted its ninth Florida Mission of Mercy event on May 31-June 1 at the RP Funding Center in Lakeland, which provided donated dental care valued at approximately $2.3 million to more than 1,850 Floridians. Florida Mission of Mercy is a two-day dental clinic sponsored by the FDA Foundation to provide treatment to patients who lack access to dental care. Previous Florida Mission of Mercy events held in Tampa, Jacksonville, Pensacola, Fort Myers, Orlando, Tallahassee and West Palm Beach provided nearly 14,000 patients with donated dental care valued at more than $14.6 million. “We are grateful for the opportunity to provide education, critical dental treatment and preventive care to more than 1,800 community members,” said Dr. Paul Palo, co-chair of the 2024 Florida Mission of Mercy.\n\n“Florida Mission of Mercy brings together hundreds of dentists, dental professionals, medical professionals, and other volunteers from across the state to help relieve pain and restore smiles while promoting oral health awareness and education,” said Dr. Chris Bulnes, co-chair of the 2024 Florida Mission of Mercy. “We make a significant impact not only on patients but also our communities by providing treatment to those who might otherwise seek temporary care in the emergency room.”\n\n—The Florida Legislature told AHCA to revamp its private duty nursing reimbursement methodology. Lawmakers want reimbursements to reflect differences in acuity and other circumstances affecting the availability of private duty nurses. To that end, AHCA asked Medicaid enrolled home health agencies, independent registered nurses (RNs) and independent licensed practical nurses (LPNs) enrolled in Florida Medicaid to complete a brief survey. Comments were due by May 29. AHCA did not say how many nurses responded to the survey. The agency must submit the proposed reimbursement model to the Governor’s office, the Senate Committee on Appropriations, and the House Appropriations Committee by Aug. 1.\n\n— ROSTER —\n\n—Nemours Children’s Health has hired Katie Flury to serve as its director of external affairs. In this role, she will lead local and state government relations and community engagement efforts across Florida for the pediatric health system. Flury served as government affairs advisor for GrayRobinson’s Orlando office, where she had worked since 2016. “With her extensive experience in government affairs and public policy, Katie will be a true asset to our team,” said Jacob Horner, associate Vice President of state external affairs for Nemours Children’s. “Her unique health care expertise and demonstrated ability to cultivate relationships make her a natural fit for our organization.”\n\n— ICYMI —\n\nIn case you missed them, here is a recap of other critical health care policy stories covered in Florida Politics this past week.\n\n“Gov. DeSantis signs bill creating grant program for sickle cell disease research, treatment” via Jesse Scheckner of Florida Politics — Treatment centers that help thousands of Floridians with sickle cell disease could soon get a new funding infusion from the state through legislation DeSantis just signed. DeSantis authorized HB 7085, which creates the Sickle Cell Disease Research and Treatment Grant Program within the Florida Department of Health.Under the program, the department’s Office of Minority Health and Health Equity will provide grants to community-based sickle cell disease treatment and research centers. The money is to pay for therapeutic operations, workforce and workforce development costs.\n\n“Gov. DeSantis signs bill imposing restrictions on red light camera programs” via A.G. Gancarski of Florida Politics — Localities that want to impose red light cameras on citizens will need to be more transparent about the process, after DeSantis signed a bill Friday establishing parameters. HB 1363, which passed the Senate and the House without a single no vote earlier this year, puts new stipulations on these controversial devices. Localities are compelled to make annual reports of activity regarding traffic infraction detectors at public meetings. Similarly, local legislative bodies are compelled to approve the contract for these devices during a publicly-noticed meeting.\n\n“Moms for cannabis? Pro-marijuana ad says a legal market is a safer one” via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics — The 20-second video, entitled “Fact,” features a woman speaking directly to the camera, acting as a Florida mom while offering legalized marijuana as a better path than leaving a black market in place. “Millions of Floridians use marijuana. It’s a fact,” she said. “Most Americans have access to legal marijuana that is regulated and tested for safety but not Florida.”\n\n”Viral Exchange” via Jacob Ogles of Florida Politics — Tense and often insulting exchanges between House Republicans and Anthony Fauci made headlines after a hearing of the House Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic. However, some attention was generated by a brief back-and-forth between U.S. Rep. Jared Moskowitz and the epidemiology expert. That was mostly for some signature trolling by the Parkland Democrat, who noted that Trump, shortly before leaving office in 2021, gave Fauci a presidential commendation, specifically for his work on Operation Warp Speed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Of note, Moskowitz served in Florida as DeSantis’ Director of Emergency Management at the time, once wearing an N95 mask on the cover of INFLUENCE Magazine. DeSantis would go on to rail against mask and vaccine mandates, even suggesting vaccines for COVID-19 pose a health risk despite touring the state distributing vaccines at pop-up clinics in 2021.\n\n“Ruth’s List Florida backs its first transgender candidate with Ashley Brundage endorsement in HD 65” via Janelle Irwin Taylor of Florida Politics — Ruth’s List Florida is endorsing Ashley Brundage in the race for House District 65. The Tampa Democrat, if elected, would be the state’s first transgender woman to hold office in Florida, and it’s the first time Ruth’s List has endorsed a transgender candidate. Ruth’s List is Florida’s only organization dedicated to electing pro-abortion rights Democratic women in the state. Ashley Brundage’s courage to lead and mentor others to draw strength and power from life’s challenges make her uniquely qualified to serve in Florida’s state legislature to work to help Floridians thrive and prosper again,” Ruth’s List Florida CEO Christina Diamond said.\n\n— FOR YOUR RADAR —\n\nAside from coverage by Florida Politics, these stories are worth your time.\n\n“Small business, medical freedom and drug policy collide: Will DeSantis veto hemp bill?” via Romy Ellenbogen of the Miami Herald — Thousands of Floridians have called and written DeSantis’ office to urge him to veto a bill that they say would effectively neuter the state’s hemp market and make it harder for consumers to access products they need for their mental and physical health. DeSantis’ office, which has not formally received the bill from the Legislature, declined to comment on the Governor’s stance. But some opponents of the legislation say they’re hopeful their efforts will work. Paige Figi, the executive director of Coalition for Access Now, said while she knows the Governor isn’t a cannabis supporter, she believes he does support CBD health products and the people, including veterans and first responders, who use them.\n\n“Sarasota families reveal the devastating toll of fentanyl in new documentary” via Cathy Carter of Health News Florida — America’s fentanyl crisis isn’t letting up as drug cartels continue to flood communities with the deadly opioid. A new documentary, “The Fentanyl Project,” reveals the impact the synthetic drug has had in Sarasota County. The film, which premiered at the Sarasota Film Festival, focuses on two local families dealing with the unexpected loss of a child and sibling after taking pills they did not know were laced with fentanyl. KT Curran, the film’s director, recently spoke with WUSF’s Cathy Carter.\n\n“Why Florida is America’s least gay-friendly state” via Jeff Weiner and Kathryn Varn of Axios — Florida bans transgender women and girls from participating in sports for female students. Trans people can’t use bathrooms at schools and government buildings that match their gender identity. Books about LGBTQ+ characters have been pulled from school libraries. Minors are barred from receiving gender-affirming health care, despite such treatment having support from every major medical group. And adults face more hurdles to accessing and getting insurance coverage for transition-related medical care. Earlier this year, state agencies barred trans people from changing their driver’s license to match their gender identity. LGBTQ+ advocates are actually more hopeful than they’ve been in recent years. The Florida Legislature, meanwhile, had less of an appetite for culture-war bills than in years past.\n\n— PENCIL IT IN —\n\nThursday\n\nHappy birthday to Lt. Gov.
