There is no cost for children who qualify. Our services are part of their existing health plan benefits.\n\nâ\n\nCurrently, we support patients in Texas and Florida.\n\nWe help expand the collective impact of care teams by providing more medical, behavioral, and social care in the home to children with special health care needs.\n\nâ\n\nWe aim to give care teams more peace of mind by giving our shared patients additional acute care coverage 24/7 â in particular during off work hours at night, over the weekend, and on holidays. When a child enrolls in our services, we contact their existing care team to introduce ourselves and answer any questions they have. After that, every time we provide care, we send an update to the childâs PCP and other doctors, so everyone knows about any care changes.\n\nâ\n\nFor private duty nurses (PDNs) in the home, we provide extra help through the Imagine Pediatrics app. We can help them get a prior authorization, medication refills, or equipment support. We are also available to PDNs anytime they have a question or need a quick consultation.\n\nâ\n\nThe care and support we provide is designed to improve the life and health of a child with special health care needs. So they can achieve better outcomes, and we can bring some relief and peace of mind to all those who care for them.\n\nWhen a child qualifies for our services, we call their caregiver to discuss eligibility. During that call, we describe who we are and what we do. We help them download our app and enroll their child. We also answer any questions they may have.\n\nâ\n\nCaregivers are welcome to call us at (833) 208-7770 to see if their child qualifies.\n\nParents and caregivers can expect to be heard and helped as they care for their child. Throughout the enrollment process, we listen closely to caregivers to learn all about their childâs needs. We do this so that anytime their child needs care, we can help immediately. After enrollment, our team of doctors, nurses, social workers, and other clinicians will be ready 24/7 to provide care and support. We help caregivers get referrals and medication refills. We also help with equipment repairs and replacements. All of our services are designed to improve the life and health of a child with special health care needs. So they can stay out of the hospital, and we can bring their caregivers some relief and peace of mind.\n\nYes. When a child enrolls in our services, they keep all their current doctors. We do not replace anyone on a childâs existing care team. We partner with their doctors to provide an extra layer of 24/7 care and support in the home. When a child we care for has a change in symptoms, we help parents and caregivers decide if their child can be cared for at home, if they should get an in-home visit from a member of our care team, or if they should be taken to the emergency room.\n\nâ\n\nWe also provide extra help to private duty nurses based in the home. We can help them get a prior authorization, medication refills, or equipment support. We are also available to them anytime they have a question or need a quick consultation.\n\nWe are different from member services at a health plan because we provide health care directly to children with special health care needs. We are a team of doctors, nurses, social workers, therapists, and other clinicians. We team up with a childâs current doctors to be sure that kids have continuous access to the care they need and deserve. We are ready day and night to help children and their caregivers in their home. We answer questions, perform virtual care visits, help with medication refills, equipment issues, appointment scheduling, and more. We are an extra layer of care and support. Our goal is to help kids avoid unnecessary ER visits so they can spend more time at home and in their community",

At one point, it almost started to feel like a call center with clients who never answered the phone. If you want to grow as a social worker with supportive management, this company may not be the best fit for you. There are many more cons to say including the lack of diversity (rarely any POC on the leadership/ board team).
