First, customers can relaunch the EC2 instance from a snapshot or image taken before 9:30 PM PDT. We have also been able to confirm that the update that caused the CrowdStrike agent issue is no longer being automatically updated. Second, the following steps can be followed to delete the file on the affected instance:  \n  \n1. Create a snapshot of the EBS root volume of the affected instance  \n2. Create a new EBS Volume from the snapshot in the same availability zone  \n3. Launch a new Windows instance in that availability zone using a similar version of Windows  \n4. Attach the EBS volume from step (2) to the new Windows instance as a data volume  \n5. Navigate to \\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\drivers\\\\CrowdStrike\\\\ folder on the attached volume and delete \"C00000291\\*.sys\"  \n6. Detach the EBS volume from the new Windows instance  \n7.

We spent 36 hours changing bios to ACHI so we could get into Safemode as Raid doesn’t support safemode and now we cannot change them back without reimaging. \n\nLuckily our SCCM techs were able to create a task sequence to pull the bitlocker pwd from AD and delete the corrupted file, and so with USB keys we can boot into SCCM TS and run the fix in 3 minutes without swapping bios settings. \n\nAt the end of June, 3 weeks ago, Crowdstrike sent a corrupted definition that hung the 100,000 computers and servers at 90% CPU and took multiple 10 Minute reboots to recover. \n\nWe told them then they need to TEST their files before deploying. \n\nObviously the company ignored that and then intentionally didn’t PS1 and PS2 test this update at all. \n\nHow can anyone trust them again?  Once they make a massive error a MONTH ago and do nothing to change the testing process and then proceed to harm patients by taking down Emergency Rooms and Operating Rooms?\n\nAs a sysadmin for 35 years this is the biggest disaster to healthcare I have ever seen.

Adding a monkey wrench to this, our desktops / laptops use a non Microsoft full disk encryption solution. It’s been one hell of a ride so far. I’m part of the desktop endpoint management team and at 1:45am  yesterday before we knew the issue was crowdstrike I woke up to an emergency conference call being asked if my team had deployed any windows updates or something else causing this, I could not immediately access our admin console so I was triple guessing myself thinking we did something by mistake.

We run Crowdstrike provided by our enterprise. Crowdstrike pushed an update on a Friday evening that was incompatible with up-to-date Debian stable. So we patched Debian as usual, everything was fine for a week, and then all of our servers across multiple websites and cloud hosts simultaneously hard crashed and refused to boot.\n\nWhen we connected one of the disks to a new machine and checked the logs, Crowdstrike looked like a culprit, so we manually deleted it, the machine booted, tried reinstalling it and the machine immediately crashes again. OK, let's file a support ticket and get an engineer on the line.\n\nCrowdstrike took a day to respond, and then asked for a bunch more proof (beyond the above) that it was their fault. They acknowledged the bug a day later, and weeks later had a root cause analysis that they didn't cover our scenario (Debian stable running version n-1, I think, which is a supported configuration) in their test matrix. In our own post mortem there was no real ability to prevent the same thing from happening again -- \"we push software to your machines any time we want, whether or not it's urgent, without testing it\" seems to be core to the model, particularly if you're a small IT part of a large enterprise.

Obviously whatever change it was, was likely not meant to land in the root level, and someone from (speculation here) Crowdstrike’s content deployment team probably forgot a trailing slash to the actual intended directory. Which is why a simple file delete will fix it. Has anyone analyzed the actual file yet? The only thing I’ve gathered now is that the file itself is causing memory issues and Windows is freaking out and kernel panicking the OS.\n\nEither way, it’s the fix/solution that’s so absurdly time consuming especially with the need to decrypt these business endpoints in BIOS with a bit locker key before even getting into safe mode to delete said file and then reboot again, and then bit lock again. A very tiresome manual process especially with remote users, with which doing this thousands of times over will take a long time for some businesses. Seems there are some automated ways to do this, but the decryption is not so easy. And if your company has any kind of security policy (which they would) they’re not just going to allow some open source quick fix to enter their network without the highest level of vetting and approval themselves or to create their own which would require a thorough vetting process, and would take a while to get tested and approved. And remember, Microsoft says “just turn it off and on again” because maybe the end point will reach Crowdstrike’s servers on reboot forget that a HUGE amount of these affected machines are probably airgapped or offline, segregated from certain parts of the business’s network(s) for security reasons and can’t be reached like a traditional end client. Either way, I feel for all IT staff out there having to deal with this.\n\n## Comment ID ldyznd7 with +3 score by [(ShamanOty, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldyznd7/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nWhat a wonderful day we had , thank you cloud strike you just stopped our whole production in over 60 factories , im sure no one could breach into our systems today 😁 , that's an insane security level.\n\n## Comment ID ldz15m2 with +3 score by [(verismRIP, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldz15m2/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nPraying for anyone with no immediate access to Bitlocker recovery keys.

I'm lost trying to understand:  When a new version 'n' of the sensor is released, we upgrade a selected batch of machines and do some tests (mostly waiting around :-)) to see that all is well.  Then we upgrade the rest of the fleet by OU. However, 'cause we're scaredy cats, we leave some critical kit on n-1 for longer.  And some really critical kit even on n-2.  (Yeah, there's a risk in not applying patches I know but there are other outage-related risks that we balance; forget that for now)  Our assumption is that n-1, n-2, etc are old, stable releases, and so when fan and shit collided yesterday, we just hopped on the console and did a policy update to revert to n-2 and assumed we'd dodged the bullet.  But of course, that failed... you know what they say about assumptions :-)  So in a long-winded way that leads to my three questions:  Why did the 'content update'  take out not just n but n-whatever sensors equally as effectively?  Are the n-whatever versions not actually stable?  And if the n-whatever versions are not actually stable and are being patched, what's the point of the versioning?

For Windows, it installs as a Boot-Start Driver, so it must start successfully for the OS to boot up.\n\nOne feature of Falcon is to monitor named pipe executions on Windows systems. Named Pipes are a mechanism for interprocess communication in Windows that can be exploited by malicious actors.\n\n**Error**\n\nOn July 19th, Crowdstrike published a sensor configuration update that was installed automatically on millions of systems worldwide.\n\nThe update contained an erroneous file, C-00000291\\*.sys, which is a configuration file also known as a channel file.\n\nWhen the Falcon driver accesses this configuration file, it encounters a logic error and crashes. Ultimately causing the dreaded Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).\n\n**Fix**\n\nFor individual machines:\n\n1. Boot into safe mode / Windows Recovery Environment\n2. Open Terminal in Safe Mode or select it in the Windows Recovery Environment\n3. cd to %WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\drivers\\\\CrowdStrike\n4. Delete files matching regex: C-00000291\\*.sys\n5. Reboot\n\nFor servers:\n\n1. Detach OS disk volume from the impacted server\n2. Create a snapshot/backup just in case\n3. Mount the disk onto a virtual server\n4. Repeat the steps to delete the affected files like the above\n5. Reattach the disk back onto the server.\n\n### Comment ID le2zqwv with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/le2zqwv/) (in reply to ID le2vh46):\nNull pointer causing crash?

How can such a thing go unnoticed in such a big security-oriented company? This shows some extensive rot inside.

From all companies I know: Every rollout will be stopped immediately if the error rate hits a certain percentage. And if 100% of the clients are offline after the update, this should be also considered as error (but maybe no one thought it could be that bad). \n\nBut even before that.

We are an M365 E3 licensed org with the E5 security suite added on for users.  There is a lot of integration with MS across the solution stack, however from a management side we do not have dedicated security people that can stay on top of everything.  Yes, it is working and online, but if something major were to happen we would be looking for resources and support needs very quickly.  This is why a possible managed CS solution has been talked about. \n\nTechnically, we would still have several MS security items in place and Defender would still be online, just taking a backseat if you will to CS that is installed on workstation's and servers.\n\nI wanted to see if there is anyone that currently has a Defender solution in place and then went with CS?  If yes, what was the reason and how has it been?  If no, what was the reason?\n\nI am not sure on what the cost structure of something like this would look like, and it might not be possible, but I am gathering information and wanted to hear what others have done in this situation.\n\nThank you and I welcome any feedback or thoughts you have!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Comment ID ksqk8sc with +27 score by [(OK_SmellYaLater, Reddit, 2024-02-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1b35fbs/crowdstrike_vs_ms_defender/ksqk8sc/) (in reply to ID 1b35fbs):\nWe have run the CrowdStrike Falcon Complete on 4500 hosts for 3.5 years and are very happy with the service. Users and endpoints are a huge risk to the organization, so our selection process didn't include the option for Microsoft Defender only because we prefer a defense in depth approach with multiple layers. While Microsoft can cover all of the bases, they don't really do anything great and we don't like the thought of Microsoft \"grading their own homework\" so to speak. This is why we have added additional layers or outsourced security aspects to other vendors and 3rd parties when possible, like using Avanan for email security and Rapid7 instead of Sentinel etc.  \n\nCrowdStrike Falcon Complete is kick ass. It might be cost prohibitive if you are under 300 licenses, but the cost is absolutely worth it if you can pull it off. In the last 3+ years they have stopped 2 ransomware attacks and remediated other significant infections with very little effort on our side, if any. Their incident response team is great and have been helpful with information and assistance on incidents that weren't related to endpoints/crowdstrike. Support is amazing. I couldn't recommend them any higher.\n\n### Comment ID ksskmim with +1 score by [(WraithYourFace, Reddit, 2024-03-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1b35fbs/crowdstrike_vs_ms_defender/ksskmim/) (in reply to ID ksqk8sc):\nThat's where I wish CS would have a small business version.  We only had 155 assets, but required a minimum of 250.  We went with Sophos MDR because of this.  I think we were quoted like $50k a year for the bare minimum. \n\nDoes Falcon Complete also monitor M365 or ingest from like firewalls?  We actually used their Identity product and it's great.

Looking at tech specs, both are very similar, but Defender requires someone to love it, feed it logs, analyze events, configure and tune, etc. Simply, we don't have the time or resources to do that ourselves.\n\nCS is a significantly cheaper way of engaging a SOC   on a 24/7/365 basis which I would never be able to do in my own team. \n\nAlso, I LOVE the spotlight feature of complete.\n\n## Comment ID ksq0vr3 with +21 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-02-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1b35fbs/crowdstrike_vs_ms_defender/ksq0vr3/) (in reply to ID 1b35fbs):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID ksq3f6s with +5 score by [(OpeningFeeds, Reddit, 2024-02-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1b35fbs/crowdstrike_vs_ms_defender/ksq3f6s/) (in reply to ID ksq0vr3):\nThis does not come across that way at all.  For smaller and even medium sized orgs the Microsoft solution does look very good, and it is a good product.  \n\nThe missing item is:  Who do you call and what do you do when something happens? \n\nThe solution is an enterprise solution that is not really geared for the smaller orgs.  It does take some technical steps to get it online, make sure it is working, and keep everything good.  Then if you do see alerts, knowing what to do is the big item and how quickly can we respond?\n\nThis is why this has come up.

You should spin up a 2-week POC/demo with a 3rd party ICES like Abnormal or Avanan and you will see a huge difference with what they find. We had a 50%+ improvement in detections and false positives when we did our POC with Avanan and it was an easy sell to senior leadership with the reporting that they were able to provide.

Run both stacked (make some excludes so they are not tampering with one another), MDE has other features (exploit protection, ASR, controlled folders, network protection, etc.), I wouldn't just turn it off. Stack them and leave Defender as the primary AV registered (skip enabling Quarantine in CS prevention policies); and you have best of both worlds.

For most customers the difference lies in the ability to operate them - the tools don't provide much value if their not well configured with a 24x7 detection and response SOC behind it.\n\nI'll standby that if MS could get security well, none of us (in security) would have a job. You need check and balance. However, most customers do end up with MS as their IT will buy E5 for other reasons.\n\nWith CS Falcon complete, just note the limitations. They're great at detecting and responding to threats but that's it. If you have a problem with CS software, you call support and not the falcon team. They don't implement best practice policies either - who's going to setup identity and ensure your AD policies aligned? What if you have a question on a vulnerability spotlight detected? Crickets.

A staged approach to Windows and antivirus updates (really any update that changes the system state) should be staged even if they are virtual machines and tested for a week before deployment.\n\nWould you change your tires on your car while driving? Hell no. Why patch systems and make system driver modifications during the day? Why allow other businesses to dictate the operating state of the machines?\n\nSure, this is a software flaw, but the real issue is the usage and implementation of the software. The lack of proper system maintenance design. It seems like everyone is offloading the issue saying it’s crowdstrikes fault but really it’s poor system hygiene.\n\nSource: I have been in technology for 28 years working with everything from the electrons entering the system to the packets and video flowing out. I worked at one of the first companies to design compliant hosting rules and guidelines with card companies like visa. Our systems were very secure. We did not allow any outbound traffic. We used systems and software like tripwire to identify any system state changes that were unexpected.\n\nThis issue with crowdstrike was 100% preventable.\n\n## Comment ID leg3kdm with +2 score by [(StandardDeparture876, Reddit, 2024-07-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1e6vq04/many_windows_10_machines_blue_screening_stuck_at/leg3kdm/) (in reply to ID 1e6vq04):\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fudbejge25ed1.png?width=375&format=png&auto=webp&s=c39c2e5864131bf7b084cc0af096bea1a0054f70\n\n## Comment ID ldw0lgu with +2 score by [(Tensoneu, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1e6vq04/many_windows_10_machines_blue_screening_stuck_at/ldw0lgu/) (in reply to ID 1e6vq04):\nI'm just laughing at the whole situation....I'm a sitting duck atm.\n\n## Comment ID ldvwnjo with +2 score by [(gregarious119, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1e6vq04/many_windows_10_machines_blue_screening_stuck_at/ldvwnjo/) (in reply to ID 1e6vq04):\nSame here\n\n## Comment ID ldvxx8l with +2 score by [(JohnHurts, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1e6vq04/many_windows_10_machines_blue_screening_stuck_at/ldvxx8l/) (in reply to ID 1e6vq04):\nGermany too\n\n## Comment ID ldw1zfm with +2 score by [(timawesomeness, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1e6vq04/many_windows_10_machines_blue_screening_stuck_at/ldw1zfm/) (in reply to ID 1e6vq04):\nDefinitely crowdstrike.

It's very dangerous. For example, Simplethink is the root cause of every nuclear plant disaster, every failed government policy, and poorly architected update systems. Please be more careful to use nuance in thought.\n\nMicrosoft's FUGASWRSFF system (\"forced update global automatic simultaneous without reboot success/fail flagging\") puts the \"F.U.\" back into mission critical systems by violating the #1 rule and #2 rule of mission critical update protocols. So it's indeed a huge Microsoft issue. Bugs in updates happen all the time. Unavoidably so. In systems adhering to protocol, they get caught after affecting only the first few users.\n\nFor this bug to cause global worldwide outages requires the Microsoft FUGASWRSFF system.

And when all of their test deployments are successful, they press this BIG RED button that picks up this content file from the NAS drive for global deployment.\n\nDuring their prior deployments, this NAS drive had plenty of free space and deployments went well.  Now, when the NAS was full, upon copy, it produces a file with all NULL bytes.\n\nIn summary, the content file they tested with was not the file that got globally deployed.\n\n## Comment ID leen857 with +1 score by [(tfrederick74656, Reddit, 2024-07-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1e6vq04/many_windows_10_machines_blue_screening_stuck_at/leen857/) (in reply to ID 1e6vq04):\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zs0ks17zo3ed1.png?width=1656&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb2c912c1907c0f052c3553a8c588824a84eb53e\n\nHere's a flowchart/decision tree with (I think) the most up-to-date guidance.

If you're like us and have a bunch of servers in Azure running Crowdstrike, the past 8 hours have probably SUCKED for you! The only guidance is to boot in safe mode, but how the heck do you do that on an Azure VM??\n\nI wanted to quickly share what worked for us:\n\n1) Make a clone of your OS disk. Snapshot --> create a new disk from it, create a new disk directly with the old disk as source, whatever your preferred workflow is\n\n2) Attach the cloned OS disk to a functional server as a data disk\n\n3) Open disk management (create and format hard disk partitions), find the new disk, right click, \"online\"\n\n4) Check the letters of the disk partitions: both system reserved and windows\n\n5) Navigate to the staged disk's Windows drive, deal with the Crowdstrike files. Either rename the Crowdstrike folder at Windows\\System32\\drivers\\Crowdstrike as Crowdstrike.bak or similar, delete the the file matching “C-00000291*.sys”, per Crowdstrike's instructions, whatever\n\nFrom here, we found that if we replaced the disk on the server, we would get a winload.exe boot manager error instead! Don't dismount your disk, we aren't done yet!\n\n6) Pull up this MS Learn doc: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/windows/error-code-0xc000000e\n\n7) Follow the instructions in the document to run bcdedit repairs on your boot directory. So in our case, that meant the following -- replace F: and H: with the appropriate drive letters. Note that the document says you need to delete your original VM -- we found that just swapping out the disk was OK and we did not need to actually delete and recreate anything, but YMMV.\n\nbcdedit /store F:\\boot\\bcd /set {bootmgr} device partition=F:\n\nbcdedit /store F:\\boot\\bcd /set {bootmgr} integrityservices enable\n\nbcdedit /store F:\\boot\\bcd /set {af3872a5-<therestofyourguid>} device partition=H:\n\nbcdedit /store F:\\boot\\bcd /set {af3872a5-<therestofyourguid>} integrityservices enable\n\nbcdedit /store F:\\boot\\bcd /set {af3872a5-<therestofyourguid>} recoveryenabled Off\n\nbcdedit /store F:\\boot\\bcd /set {af3872a5-<therestofyourguid>} osdevice partition=H:\n\nbcdedit /store F:\\boot\\bcd /set {af3872a5-<therestofyourguid>} bootstatuspolicy IgnoreAllFailures\n\n8) NOW dismount the disk, and swap it in on your original VM. Try to start the VM. Success!? Hopefully!?\n\nHope this saves someone some headache! It's been a long night and I hope it'll be less stressful for some of you.\n\n## Comment ID ldwuujs with +32 score by [(SecAbove, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1e70rdw/psa_repairing_the_crowdstrike_bsod_on_azurehosted/ldwuujs/) (in reply to ID 1e70rdw):\nHere is the Official CrowdStrike KB [https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/s/article/Tech-Alert-Windows-crashes-related-to-Falcon-Sensor-2024-07-19](https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/s/article/Tech-Alert-Windows-crashes-related-to-Falcon-Sensor-2024-07-19)\n\n**Tech Alert | Windows crashes related to Falcon Sensor | 2024-07-19**\n\n**Published Date:Jul 19, 2024**\n\n# Summary\n\n* CrowdStrike is aware of reports of crashes on Windows hosts related to the Falcon Sensor.\n\n \n\n# Details\n\n* Symptoms include hosts experiencing a bugcheck\\\\blue screen error related to the Falcon Sensor.\n* Windows hosts which have not been impacted do not require any action as the problematic channel file has been reverted.\n* Windows hosts which are brought online after 0527 UTC will also not be impacted\n* This issue is not impacting Mac- or Linux-based hosts\n* Channel file \"C-00000291\\*.sys\" with timestamp of **0527 UTC or later** is the reverted (good) version.\n* Channel file \"C-00000291\\*.sys\" with timestamp of **0409 UTC** is the problematic version.\n\n \n\n# Current Action\n\n* CrowdStrike Engineering has identified a content deployment related to this issue and reverted those changes.\n* If hosts are still crashing and unable to stay online to receive the Channel File Changes, the following steps can be used to workaround this issue:\n\n# Workaround Steps for individual hosts:\n\n* Reboot the host to give it an opportunity to download the reverted channel file.  If the host crashes again, then:\n   * Boot Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment\n   * Navigate to the %WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\drivers\\\\CrowdStrike directory\n   * Locate the file matching “C-00000291\\*.sys”, and delete it.\n   * Boot the host normally.\n\nNote:  **Bitlocker-encrypted hosts may require a recovery key**.\n\n# Workaround Steps for public cloud or similar environment including virtual:\n\nOption 1:\n\n* Detach the operating system disk volume from the impacted virtual server\n* Create a snapshot or backup of the disk volume before proceeding further as a precaution against unintended changes\n* Attach/mount the volume to to a new virtual server\n* Navigate to the %WINDIR%\\\\\\\\System32\\\\drivers\\\\CrowdStrike directory\n* Locate the file matching “C-00000291\\*.sys”, and delete it.\n* Detach the volume from the new virtual server\n* Reattach the fixed volume to the impacted virtual server\n\nOption 2:\n\n* Roll back to a snapshot before 0409 UTC. \n\n \n\n# Workaround Steps for Azure via serial\n\n1.

Hovever microsoft updated their KB on [https://azure.status.microsoft/en-gb/status](https://azure.status.microsoft/en-gb/status) Copy of the MS KB below, **The TLDR - do many VM reboots (up to 15!)**\n\n## \n\nWe have been made aware of an issue impacting Virtual Machines running Windows Client and Windows Server, running the CrowdStrike Falcon agent, which may encounter a bug check (BSOD) and get stuck in a restarting state. We approximate impact started around 19:00 UTC on the 18th of July.\n\nAdditional details from CrowdStrike are available here: [Statement on Windows Sensor Update - crowdstrike.com](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-windows-sensor-update/)\n\n**Update as of 10:30 UTC on 19 July 2024:**\n\nWe have received reports of successful recovery from some customers attempting multiple Virtual Machine restart operations on affected Virtual Machines. Customers can attempt to do so as follows:\n\n* Using the Azure Portal - attempting 'Restart' on affected VMs\n* Using the Azure CLI or Azure Shell ([https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com/))\n\n\n\nWe've received feedback from customers that several reboots (as many as 15 have been reported) may be required, but overall feedback is that reboots are an effective troubleshooting step at this stage.\n\n**Additional options for recovery:**\n\nWe recommend customers that are able to, to restore from a backup from before 19:00 UTC on the 18th of July.\n\n* Customers leveraging Azure Backup can follow the following instructions:\n\n[How to restore Azure VM data in Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms)\n\n* Alternatively, customers can attempt to repair the OS disk offline by following these instructions: \n\n[Attach an unmanaged disk to a VM for offline repair](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/windows/unmanaged-disk-offline-repair)\n\n* Disks that are encrypted may need these additional instructions:\n\n[Unlocking an encrypted disk for offline repair](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/windows/unlock-encrypted-disk-offline)\n\nOnce the disk is attached, customers can attempt to delete the following file. \n\nWindows/System/System32/Drivers/CrowdStrike/C00000291\\*.sys\n\nThe disk can then be attached and re-attached to the original VM.\n\nWe can confirm the affected update has been pulled by CrowdStrike. Customers that are continuing to experience issues should reach out to CrowdStrike for additional assistance.\n\nAdditionally, we're continuing to investigate additional mitigation options for customers and will share more information as it becomes known.\n\nThis message was last updated at 11:36 UTC on 19 July 2024\n\n#### Comment ID ldxcsrh with +2 score by [(manvscar, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1e70rdw/psa_repairing_the_crowdstrike_bsod_on_azurehosted/ldxcsrh/) (in reply to ID ldx6srr):\nI noticed that my VM's do actually respond to ping for a couple seconds until they BSOD and restart again.

That said, I pride myself on our rollout plans for our updates in this environment, in every controllable update channel we have staggered rollouts that last weeks before they push to all workstations/servers, specifically to prevent critical workstations from experiencing outages.\n\nThe way this article frames the issue, makes it sound like there is something that could have been configured by an administrator differently to prevent the update from rolling out and would have required explicit approval first. To my knowledge, the driver update that was pushed by the Crowdstrike devs bypassed all those controls. I am very open to hearing if that is not the case, as my security team needs to re-evaluate our processes for these updates if we could be rolling them out in a more controlled manner.\n\nIf my understanding is correct, this article is just another attempt to shift the blame of Crowdstrikes mistake onto IT admins, and I am sick of this trend of trying to blanket blame the paying customers for a vendors mistake. It seems like the person who was quoted in this article doesn't know what they are talking about.\n\nThis is important to me as a lot of senior leadership in organizations are not technology experts, and they may read an article like this and misattribute the blame for the Crowdstrike outage to IT administrators, when this particular major outage belongs SOLEY in the hands of the Crowdstrike dev teams.

There's always going to be an accepted level of risk based on likelihood, and sometimes the on paper plan *is* just identifying \"there's nothing we can legitimately do if XYZ goes down but wait for it to come back up.\"\n\nFor example, if some jerk with a backhoe cuts the lines out on the street and that cuts both my primary and secondary ISP coming into an office with critical infrastructure to my business, there's not a whole lot we're going to do about it other than wait for them to repair the lines.  It's an accepted risk.  We're not going to develop a BCP that *immediately* physically relocates everything to another location, by the time we got that done the lines are likely to be repaired and now our infrastructure is a mess and we exacerbated the losses.  There will *always* be another level of \"but what if...\"\n\nLikewise the Crowdstrike situation is \"what do we do if literally our *entire computing environment* is hard down due to a bad patch from a vendor\" the BCP is almost certainly just going to be \"wait for the vendor to fix it and roll out the fix per their specifications\" and... that's just the risk.  The answer wouldn't be \"immediately reimage everything with local accounts, gut all the infrastructure, and recreate it without Crowdstrike installs.\"  You wouldn't get that drastic until it was clear that a fix was *not* coming.\n\nEven the best laid plans never survive contact with the situation they were designed to address.  On some level its similar to running a car wash - \"what's the plan if it rains tomorrow?\" Well, we just don't open.  We don't move the car wash three towns over.\n\n### Comment ID lfpqi20 with +3 score by [(Liquidretro, Reddit, 2024-07-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1efspk1/the_article_linked_below_postures_that_the/lfpqi20/) (in reply to ID lfn6gd5):\nA big part of Delta's problem was their ancient crew scheduling software.

There were layoffs disguised as RTO policy-related firings in 2023, plenty of legitimate glassdoor reviews to substantiate that claim. Those layoffs largely impacted their QA teams who were subsequently replaced in part with AI… and the rest is history. \n\nWe already know that at least one of their engineers didn’t catch a memory reference that went nowhere and that’s what caused systems to crash since windows treated the issue as if the system had been compromised, and so crashed to “prevent damage”.\n\nHad QA been properly staffed and code changes properly vetted ahead of being pushed to the entire planet, the whole outage could have been avoided.

To my knowledge, the driver update that was pushed by the Crowdstrike devs bypassed all those controls. I am very open to hearing if that is not the case, as my security team needs to re-evaluate our processes for these updates if we could be rolling them out in a more controlled manner. \n \nthe one crowdstrike config that I saw which prevented the BSOD update was have an update exclusion policy in place to lock specific falcon sensor versions. Specifically, v7.0.1 sensor was not impacted by the issue.   \n \nMy org had an update exclusion rule in place for v7.0.1 systems with a specific storage driver loaded where we have a known incompatibility with newer releases that we have been slowly remediating.   \n \nMost of our non-version locked windows systems were impacted.

Direct managers need clearer roles focused on providing guidance and addressing employee concerns directly, supported by leadership training and feedback systems. To bridge the gap with senior management, regular town halls, engagement surveys, and mentorship programs should be implemented.

A review of HR practices can rebuild trust and align policies with company goals, fostering a more equitable and supportive workplace.",

Manager doesn’t directly answer question but rather sends you to other people to answer your questions. Big disconnect with senior management and employees. \nHR is actually a joke - the offer I received on the phone was not the same as the contract given. Also super picky on timing of when you should come into the office which has no direct correlation to making sales or benefiting the bottom line for the company.\n\nThey also sent the employee review form prior to make drastic company changes.",

Training is reactive, often necessitating on-the-fly support for unfamiliar products.\n\nL2 support expectations combine L1 and L2 roles. This means you are expected to be a subject matter expert for a small product segment while still managing new cases, escalating your own cases, handling escalations with T3 and beyond, and answering inbound calls—despite an ineffective phone routing system. The mentality is to take on more cases and do more, creating an extremely stressful environment that can lead to anxiety and depression, requiring medication. Job duties can change abruptly without notice when management decides on a new approach. Leadership lacks direct experience on a support desk.",

This creates internal/external conflict and hostility. - PTO usage - despite unlimited PTO being the policy, there are managers who monitor, track and limit time off for team members. - Culture Shift: The focus on “world domination” has created a noticeable difference in morale and business operations. People and process first culture has taken a backseat to being the biggest, fastest and strongest security provider. More burnout, more patchy solutions to quickly solve problems that could have been superbly implemented with proper communication and expectations set on timing.",

For months it has felt like no one really cares and everyone collects a check, empty promises and little to no path to promotion and honestly well under compensated to market. Feels like a sinking ship that no one cares to fix and senior leadership is extremely disconnected from day - to - day ops. The company pitches “remote first” but requires to be in office two days a week (total frat house &amp; waste of time) Sad, this place use to be culture first now it seems as though it had totally lost its way and is toying with people’s careers and compensation by being clueless and frankly careless.",

          "cons": "When I was writing this out there were more things than I initially thought, but here goes: - I understand the pressure that leadership is under. They serve two masters: we need to fulfill our mission and keep our customers safe, but also continue to grow as fast as we can, and while our customers and Wall Street frequently overlap in what they want and need, sometimes those goals don't always align. Depending on who you ask, there are a lot of focus areas and a ton of priorities. 5 year plans. Speeches at quarterly All hands. Corporate and team goals, and it gets dizzying. The message is often unclear. - I haven't been here forever, but while CrowdStrike has a ton of great people, it's filled with more than its fair share of \"rest and vest\" pre-IPO veterans who like to sit and complain about the good ol' days, even though they don't seem to produce much at all. - To the point above, while I haven't been here forever, in the years I've been here what I have seen is a leadership pullback. As the company's grown, there have been more unannounced re-orgs, execs leaving, and this and that happening with little or reactive communication, which leaves everyone wondering what's up and looking over their shoulder. Corporate comms needs to be re-done with a much clearer focus on transparency. - There is little to no training for managers, and managers aren't evaluated at all on how good they actually are as managers, so it's kind of a roll of the dice in terms of how effective your manager is and how they'll advocate for you. - Related to the above, I cannot explain to you how and why some people get promoted and others don't. There is no track or defined process, so it's very much up in the air behind a secretive and often delayed annual merit cycle. A lot of people were frustrated this year. - Speaking of, merit raises haven't been great lately. If I end up leaving, that will be why. Please give your top performers an incentive to stay! - There's no educational reimbursement at all. - 401k is embarrassingly bad for a company of our size with the revenue we generate.",

This is my first company where I'm never bothered on the weekends or after hours. - Overall, the future is bright! - This is going to sound Kool-aidy, but it's the best cybersecurity company in the industry.

This creates internal/external conflict and hostility. - PTO usage - despite unlimited PTO being the policy, there are managers who monitor, track and limit time off for team members. - Culture Shift: The focus on “world domination” has created a noticeable difference in morale and business operations. People and process first culture has taken a backseat to being the biggest, fastest and strongest security provider. More burnout, more patchy solutions to quickly solve problems that could have been superbly implemented with proper communication and expectations set on timing.",

        "cons": "When I was writing this out there were more things than I initially thought, but here goes: - I understand the pressure that leadership is under. They serve two masters: we need to fulfill our mission and keep our customers safe, but also continue to grow as fast as we can, and while our customers and Wall Street frequently overlap in what they want and need, sometimes those goals don't always align. Depending on who you ask, there are a lot of focus areas and a ton of priorities. 5 year plans. Speeches at quarterly All hands. Corporate and team goals, and it gets dizzying. The message is often unclear. - I haven't been here forever, but while CrowdStrike has a ton of great people, it's filled with more than its fair share of \"rest and vest\" pre-IPO veterans who like to sit and complain about the good ol' days, even though they don't seem to produce much at all. - To the point above, while I haven't been here forever, in the years I've been here what I have seen is a leadership pullback. As the company's grown, there have been more unannounced re-orgs, execs leaving, and this and that happening with little or reactive communication, which leaves everyone wondering what's up and looking over their shoulder. Corporate comms needs to be re-done with a much clearer focus on transparency. - There is little to no training for managers, and managers aren't evaluated at all on how good they actually are as managers, so it's kind of a roll of the dice in terms of how effective your manager is and how they'll advocate for you. - Related to the above, I cannot explain to you how and why some people get promoted and others don't. There is no track or defined process, so it's very much up in the air behind a secretive and often delayed annual merit cycle. A lot of people were frustrated this year. - Speaking of, merit raises haven't been great lately. If I end up leaving, that will be why. Please give your top performers an incentive to stay! - There's no educational reimbursement at all. - 401k is embarrassingly bad for a company of our size with the revenue we generate.",

This is my first company where I'm never bothered on the weekends or after hours. - Overall, the future is bright! - This is going to sound Kool-aidy, but it's the best cybersecurity company in the industry.

      "# [CrowdStrike Falcon Issue ‘Fix Has Been Deployed;’ Microsoft Identifies ‘Root Cause’ Of Outage by Mark Haranas](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2024/crowdstrike-falcon-issue-fix-has-been-deployed-microsoft-identifies-root-cause-of-outage)\nThe massive Microsoft Azure and CrowdStrike outage reportedly was caused by a recent update to CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor software. Here’s where everything stands as of Friday morning.\n\nFrom emergency 911 call centers to national health-care services to the largest airlines, the Microsoft Azure and CrowdStrike outage is causing chaos around the world.\n\nAs of Friday morning, CrowdStrike said, “The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.”\n\nThe outage stemmed from a recent update to CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor software, according to Microsoft, which affected Windows 365 Cloud PCs.\n\n[RELATED: 5 Things To Know On The CrowdStrike-Microsoft Outage]\n\nCrowdStrike said it is working with “customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts. Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted. This is not a security incident or cyberattack.”\n\nThe outage reportedly first began Thursday when some Microsoft clients in the U.S., such as airlines, were hit with an outage on their Azure cloud services system.\n\nMicrosoft is urging customers affected to conduct point-in-time restore for Windows 365 Business and Enterprise. Point-in-time restore enables end users to restore a Cloud PC to the exact state it was at an earlier point in time, said Microsoft in a blog post.\n\n“To fix this, users may restore their Windows 365 Cloud PC to a known good state prior to the release of the update (July 19, 2024),” Microsoft said on X. “Windows 365 Business admins can also restore Cloud PCs to an earlier state on behalf of their users,” the company said. “Short-term restore points are saved every 12 hours.”\n\nMicrosoft Identifies Preliminary Root Cause For 365 Admin Center, Teams\n\nThe outage is still affecting many Microsoft 365 users who may still be unable to access various 365 applications and services as of Friday morning, including Teams.\n\nMicrosoft said the “preliminary root cause” was a configuration change in a portion of its Azure back-end workloads that “caused interruption between storage and compute resources, which resulted in connectivity failures that affected downstream Microsoft 365 services dependent on these connections.”\n\nMicrosoft Teams users may still be unable to leverage Microsoft Teams functions including presence, group chats and user registration. “Microsoft 365 admins may be intermittently unable to access the Microsoft 365 admin center and any action may be delayed if accessible,” the company said.\n\nMicrosoft is continuing to apply mitigation actions to provide relief from the impact affecting the remaining Microsoft 365 apps and services.\n\n“Our telemetry is indicating that the remaining impacted scenarios are progressing towards a full recovery and we’re closely monitoring to ensure this progress continues,” Microsoft said.\n\nCrowdStrike CEO Kurtz provided a statement on X Friday regarding the issue.\n\nHe said his Austin, Texas-based cybersecurity firm is working with customers impacted by the update that affected Windows hosts. Kurtz reiterated that the issue was not a “security incident or cyberattack.”\n\n“We further recommend organizations ensure they’re communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels,” Kurtz said. “Our team is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers.”\n\nMicrosoft Azure ‘Reboots’ Are Working\n\nFor Microsoft Azure, there are still service issues impacting virtual machines running Windows Client and Windows Server that are running the CrowdStrike Falcon agent, which may encounter a bug check (BSOD) and agent stuck in a restarting state.\n\n“We have received reports of successful recovery from some customers attempting multiple Virtual Machine restart operations on affected Virtual Machines,” Microsoft said. “We’ve received feedback from customers that several reboots (as many as 15 have been reported) may be required, but overall feedback is that reboots are an effective troubleshooting step at this stage.”\n\nCrowdStrike is referring customers to its support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide updates on its website.\n\n“We further recommend organizations ensure they’re communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels,” CrowdStrike said. “Our team is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers.”\n\nCustomers first began reporting issues through the Down Detector website, which data shows hit a peak at around 3 a.m. ET.",

      "# [related IT outages by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2024-07-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages)\nGlobal computer systems outage\n\n2024 CrowdStrike-related IT outagesDate19 July 2024; 6 months ago ( )LocationWorldwideTypeIT outage, computer crashCauseFaulty CrowdStrike software updateOutcome~8.5 million Microsoft Windows operating systems crash worldwide, causing global disruption of critical services\n\nOn 19 July 2024, American cybersecurity company CrowdStrike distributed a faulty update to its Falcon Sensor security software that caused widespread problems with Microsoft Windows computers running the software. As a result, roughly 8.5 million systems crashed and were unable to properly restart[1] in what has been called the largest outage in the history of information technology[2] and \"historic in scale\".[3]\n\nThe outage disrupted daily life, businesses, and governments around the world. Many industries were affected—airlines, airports, banks, hotels, hospitals, manufacturing, stock markets, broadcasting, gas stations, retail stores, and more—as were governmental services, such as emergency services and websites.[4][5] The worldwide financial damage has been estimated to be at least US$10 billion.[6]\n\nWithin hours, the error was discovered and a fix was released,[7] but because many affected computers had to be fixed manually,[8] outages continued to linger on many services.[9][10]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nCrowdStrike produces a suite of security software products for businesses, designed to protect computers from cyberattacks. Falcon, CrowdStrike's endpoint detection and response agent, works at the operating system kernel level on individual computers to detect and prevent threats.[11] Patches are routinely distributed by CrowdStrike to its clients to enable their computers to address new threats.[12]\n\nCrowdStrike's own post-incident investigation identified several errors that led to the release of a fault update to the \"Crowdstrike Sensor Detection Engine\":[13][non-primary source needed]\n\nThe channel files[clarification needed] were validated using Regex patterns with wildcards and loaded into an array instead of using a parser for this purpose.\n\nIn the programming language C, the length of arrays must be treated and checked separately. However, the length was not checked before access. An array with 21 fields was expected, but the channel file was in an older data format with only 20 fields.\n\nIn the unit tests, only the happy path was tested. Regression tests for compatibility with the older data format were not conducted.\n\nIn manual tests, only valid data was tested.\n\nThe channel files did not contain a version number field that was checked.\n\nThere were no staggered rollouts, but the update was distributed to all customers simultaneously. Even critical infrastructure was not specially treated.\n\nThe software does not access the system on Microsoft Windows through a suitable application programming interface but runs as a driver in ring 0 to have elevated privileges on the operating system. However, a crash in this area leads to a blue screen of death, which stops the operating system.\n\nOutage\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 19 July at 04:09 UTC, CrowdStrike distributed a faulty configuration update for its Falcon sensor software running on Windows PCs and servers. A modification to a configuration file which was responsible for screening named pipes, Channel File 291, caused an out-of-bounds memory read[14] in the Windows sensor client that resulted in an invalid page fault. The update caused machines to either enter into a bootloop or boot into recovery mode.[16]\n\nAlmost immediately, Windows virtual machines on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform began rebooting and crashing,[17] and at 06:48 UTC, Google Compute Engine also reported the problem. The problem affected systems running Windows 10 and Windows 11 running the CrowdStrike Falcon software.[18] Most personal Windows PCs were unaffected, as CrowdStrike's software is primarily used by organizations.[18] The CrowdStrike software did not provide a way for subscribers to delay the installation of its content files.[19] Computers running macOS and Linux were unaffected, as the problematic content file was only for Windows,[20] but similar problems had affected Linux distributions of CrowdStrike software in April 2024.[21][22]\n\nCrowdStrike reverted the content update at 05:27 UTC,[23] and devices that booted after the revert were not affected.[24]\n\nAt 07:15 UTC, Google said that the CrowdStrike update was at fault.[25] Within hours, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz confirmed that CrowdStrike's faulty kernel configuration file update had caused the problem.[8][7] At 09:45 UTC, Kurtz confirmed that the fix was deployed[26][27] and that the problem was not the result of a cyberattack.[8][28]\n\nThe impact to companies in the Central United States was exacerbated by an unrelated outage with Microsoft Azure the previous day.[29] On 18 July, the Azure platform had an outage that blocked some companies' access to their storage and to Microsoft 365 applications in Azure's Central United States region.[30]\n\nRemedy\n\n[edit]\n\nAffected machines could be restored by rebooting while connected to the network; ideally while connected to Ethernet, thus providing the opportunity to download the reverted channel file, with multiple reboots reportedly required.[31][23]\n\nIf crashes persisted, remediation required booting into safe mode or the Windows Recovery Environment and deleting any .sys file beginning with C-00000291- and with timestamp 04:09 UTC in the %windir%\\System32\\drivers\\CrowdStrike\\ directory.[28] As this process needed to be done locally on each individual machine, it was \"expected to take days\" for affected businesses to restore all systems.[32] Technical staff needed to reboot the affected computers individually with manual intervention on each system.[33][34][35]\n\nOn devices with Windows' BitLocker disk encryption enabled, which corporations often use to increase security, fixing the problem was exacerbated because the 48-digit numeric Bitlocker recovery keys (unique to each system) required manual input, with additional challenges supplying the recovery keys to end users working remotely. Additionally, several organisations utilising local servers for Bitlocker recovery key storage could not access keys that were stored on servers that themselves had crashed.[36][37]\n\nMicrosoft has also recommended restoring a backup from before 18 July to fix the issue.[38]\n\nImpact\n\n[edit]\n\nOutages were experienced worldwide,[2][39][40] reflecting the wide use of Microsoft Windows and CrowdStrike software by global corporations in numerous business sectors.[41] At the time of the incident, CrowdStrike said it had more than 24,000 customers,[42] including nearly 60% of Fortune 500 companies and more than half of the Fortune 1000.[43][44] On 20 July, Microsoft estimated that 8.5 million devices were affected by the update, which it said was less than one percent of all Windows devices.[1]\n\nWidespread outages were immediately reported across multiple countries, with major global disturbances experienced by the general public sweeping from east to west from time zone to time zone.[citation needed][clarification needed] At 04:09 UTC on 19 July, the time when the faulty update was issued, it was the middle of the business day of Oceania and Asia, the early morning hours in Europe, and midnight in much of the Americas.\n\nSome countries were less affected. China, which has striven toward self-sufficiency in IT, saw little impact to key services such as airlines and banks, although foreign businesses and luxury hotels in the country were affected.[45] Russia and Iran—both restricted by international sanctions from using the services of American high-tech companies—reported no disruptions.[46][47]\n\nCyber risk quantification company, Kovrr, calculated that the total cost to the UK economy will likely fall between £1.7 and £2.3 billion ($2.18 and $2.96 billion).[48]\n\nA specialist cloud outage insurance business estimated that the top 500 US companies by revenue, excluding Microsoft, had faced near $5.4bn (£4.1bn) in financial losses because of the outage, but only between $540m (£418m) to $1.08bn (£840m) of those losses would be insured.[49]\n\nCrowdStrike liability\n\n[edit]\n\nCrowdStrike's own terms and conditions for their Falcon software limit liability to \"fees paid\", effectively a refund. Larger customers may have negotiated different terms.[50]\n\nIn the EU, it is possible that CrowdStrike will be held liable under a GDPR regulation related to the impact of security incidents on user data. The regulation is best known in relation to data leaks but also applies to data destruction. It is unclear whether temporary loss of access to data is enough to trigger liability, or whether GDPR applies to all incidents related to security or only unauthorised access.[51]\n\nFurther, the incident could be classed as a \"personal data breach\" which would be a data breach of the GDPR under Article 4 named \"Definitions\", paragraph 12.[51][52] On 19 July 2024, a data-protection expert reported a breach of Article 32 named \"Security of processing\".[51][53]\n\nAir transport\n\n[edit]\n\nGlobally, 5,078 air flights, 4.6% of those scheduled that day, were cancelled.[54][27] An unrelated Microsoft Azure outage, affecting services such as Microsoft 365, compounded airlines' problems.[55]\n\nOceania\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralian airlines Qantas, Virgin Australia, and Jetstar were affected.[56][57] A Sydney Airport spokesperson said that the outage had affected some operations and that \"there may be some delays throughout the evening\".[58] Melbourne Airport saw check-in procedures disrupted; officials advised passengers to consult with their airlines. The Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Darwin, Hobart, Launceston, and Perth airports were also affected.[2][5][59][60] In New Zealand, Christchurch Airport was having problems.[61]\n\nAsia\n\n[edit]\n\nHong Kong International Airport experienced delays during check-in, primarily for passengers of the local budget carrier Hong Kong Express, whose staff members used handwritten signs to direct passengers to check-in counters.[63] The Hong Kong Airport Authority activated an emergency response after airline websites and automatic check-in malfunctioned. The booking systems of local airlines Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong Express, and Hong Kong Airlines were unavailable.[64] HKExpress cancelled some flights on 20 July.[65] Jeju Air[54] and Spring Japan[54] experienced problems.[clarification needed] Jetstar Japan cancelled many (mostly domestic) flights.[66][67] Some of the self-check-in kiosks in Singapore Changi Airport were affected, delaying and forcing airlines to switch to manual check-in, and Singapore Airlines and Scoot reported various[weasel words] levels of service difficulties throughout 19 July.[68][69] Cebu Pacific and Philippines AirAsia flights were delayed.[70][71][72] Long queues formed at Ninoy Aquino International Airport.[73] In Taiwan, airline system disruptions were reported at Taoyuan International Airport.[74][75] In Indonesia, disruptions were reported for the check-in systems of AirAsia and Citilink.[76] In Thailand, Thai AirAsia's reservation and check-in systems were affected.[77]\n\nIn India, the outage affected Indigo Airlines, Akasa Air, SpiceJet, and Vistara. Handwritten boarding passes were being issued during the outage. The Ministry of Civil Aviation asked and ordered the airlines as well as the airports to be compassionate and provide food as well as seats to waiting customers as needed.[78][79][80][81] As of 18:14 IST (12:44 UTC), over 200 Indian flights had been cancelled; IndiGo alone cancelled 192.[82] Airlines that relied on Microsoft Azure for their services were affected.[83] Air India and SpiceJet said that none of its flights were cancelled due to the outage, attributing it to their robust cyber system however, minute delays were reported.[84]\n\nEurope\n\n[edit]\n\nPrague Airport[5][85] in Czechia, Budapest Airport[27] in Hungary, Bratislava Airport[86] in Slovakia, and Schiphol Airport[87] in the Netherlands experienced problems. Planes were not allowed to land at Zurich Airport.[54] Near Brussels, Charleroi Airport employees manually checked passengers in, but other software alleviated problems by 10:00 (UTC+2) and there were minimal delays.[88] ENAIRE's Aena, the Spanish national airport traffic control manager, mentioned an IT outage in their website and social media.[89] All Spanish airports reported disruptions.[90] Charles de Gaulle Airport and Orly Airport experienced check-in problems and suspended flights.[91] Poznań–Ławica Airport and Warsaw Chopin Airport experienced check-in disruptions. An emergency system was activated, and check-in processes were slower.[92] Berlin Brandenburg Airport announced that since around 07:00 (UTC+2), operational processes were affected by \"IT problems at an external provider\", and that they planned to stop flights until 08:00 UTC.[81][93] While passenger handling continued with some restrictions, there were delays and airlines cancelled some flights.[94] Several airlines (Eurowings, Ryanair, Vueling, and Turkish Airlines) in Hamburg Airport had to issue tickets by hand.[95] Croatian and Swedish air traffic control were also disrupted.[96][97]\n\nSwiss International Air Lines had 30% of flights grounded.[98] Lufthansa in Germany experienced problems with the \"profile and booking retrieval\" features of their website.[99] Ryanair's booking and check-in services were unavailable and the airline was \"forced to cancel a small number of flights\", advising passengers to arrive at airports at least three hours before departure.[100][101] Wizz Air said the outage put its online services offline.[102][103] Dutch airline KLM suspended most operations, announcing that flight handling was impossible with the issue,[citation needed] and Transavia Airlines experienced problems.[87][104] Finnair reported that they were having trouble sending emails and SMS messages to customers.[105] In Greece, citizens and tourists saw delays at major airports, notably at Athens International Airport and at Heraklion International Airport. This disruption, occurring at the peak of the tourist season, resulted in chaotic scenes as passengers were forced to wait for hours for their flights. Contributing factors included severe staff shortages and new schedules.[106][107] In Heraklion, eight flights were problematic. The airport's chief, George Pliakas, indicated that flights were being manually arranged to manage the disruption, but the influx of arriving flights strained the system.[108][109]\n\nSeveral UK airports had problems, including Edinburgh Airport, whose departure boards froze,[110] and Gatwick Airport, where automatic barcode scanning stopped working and had to be checked manually.[54] Amadeus, which manages UK baggage at Heathrow, said they were affected by the IT outage.[111] Disruption to flights was anticipated in the Isle of Man, particularly to and from the UK, but ultimately minimal.[112]\n\nMiddle East and North Africa\n\n[edit]\n\nTunisia experienced temporary airport disruptions.[113] Turkish Airlines cancelled some of its flights due to the outage.[114]\n\nNorth America\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the mid-morning of Friday 19 July, a ground stop was issued by United, Delta, and American Airlines, halting takeoffs but allowing aircraft aloft to reach their destinations.[16][115] Allegiant Air was also grounded by the outage.[5][116] Around 10:30 a.m. Eastern time, AP reported that about 1,500 flights had already been cancelled in the United States due to the outage.[66] American Airlines, United, and Allegiant recovered relatively quickly after Friday.[117][118]\n\nBut Delta, by far the hardest hit of the US major airlines, experienced an operational meltdown that continued through the weekend. The airline cancelled more than 1,200 flights on Friday.[118][119] Thousands of stranded travellers were forced to spend the night at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Delta's largest hub and the busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic.[119] Metro Atlanta hotels and rental car companies were overwhelmed by the crisis, leaving travellers no option but to stay in the airport.[120][121] One traveller attempting to return home to Tampa (after giving up on reaching California) reported that Amtrak was charging $1,000 for a one-way train ticket from Atlanta to Tampa.[122] Visibly distraught passengers with nowhere to go were seen trying to sleep in the airport on hard linoleum floors without blankets or food.[119] The airport's custodial staff were also overwhelmed, with restrooms and trash reportedly \"out of control\".[121] Without warning, Delta banned unaccompanied minors on its flights through the end of 23 July.[123] This imposed hardship on parents who had been counting on that service to enable their children to fly without the expense of an accompanying adult.[123]\n\nDelta cancelled more than 1,400 flights on 20 July,[124] and more than 1,300 flights on 21 July.[125] With so many passengers still stuck in Hartsfield–Jackson after two consecutive nights, the airport implemented a \"concessions crisis plan\" and a plan to reunite passengers with their checked baggage.[124] However, passengers in Atlanta continued to report \"jam-packed\" conditions and \"heartbreaking\" scenes in the terminals.[126]\n\nOn 21 July, Delta CEO Ed Bastian apologised to customers in a statement and revealed that the outage had left one of Delta's crew-tracking software programs \"unable to effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown\".[125][127] Delta CIO Rahul Samant said the program had been brought back online around 11 a.m. on 19 July, but was overwhelmed by the backlog of updates awaiting processing and had been trying to catch up ever since.[126] After the ground stop left too many crew members in the wrong places, Delta struggled to assemble enough pilots and flight attendants at airport gates to operate scheduled flights.[127] Many flights were repeatedly delayed and finally cancelled because the one or two crew members who made it to the gate for a particular flight kept hitting their legal flight time limit before the airline could finish fully staffing the flight, and this caused the crisis to snowball as those crew and their aircraft were now in the wrong place for the following day's flights.[127] (A similar phenomenon occurred during the 2022 Southwest Airlines scheduling crisis.[125]) That same day, US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said on social media that the US Department of Transportation had received hundreds of complaints about Delta, and reminded the airline of its legal obligations to affected passengers.[125]\n\nOn 22 July, Delta cancelled more than 1,200 flights.[126] On 23 July, the Department of Transportation announced the launch of a formal investigation into Delta's treatment of passengers.[126] Delta officials promised to cooperate but said the airline was focused on its recovery.[126] Senator Maria Cantwell, in her capacity as chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, wrote to Bastian to express her concern for Delta passengers.[126] On 23 July, Secretary Buttigieg estimated that over 500,000 passengers had been affected by Delta flight cancellations.[128] He told a press conference, \"There's a lot of things I'm very concerned about, including people being on hold for hours and hours, trying to get a new flight, people having to sleep on airport floors, even accounts of unaccompanied minors being stranded in airports, unable to get on a flight\".[129] He told CBS News: \"Stories about people in lines of more than a hundred people with just one customer service agent serving them at an airport, that's completely unacceptable.\"[130] By then, numerous passengers had ended up in different airports than their baggage because of Delta's flight cancellations, resulting in large piles of unclaimed suitcases and other checked baggage at Delta's airport terminals around the world.[131]\n\nOn 25 July, Delta returned to normal flight operations, having cancelled more than 7,000 flights; passengers had filed more than 5,000 complaints about Delta with the Department of Transportation.[132] On 26 July, The Washington Post reported that the department was investigating allegedly misleading communications from Delta that offered only credit towards future Delta flights as compensation for cancelled flights and failed to clearly notify passengers of their legal right to a cash refund.[129]\n\nOn 31 July, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said the disruption had cost the airline $500 million, and he said that Delta would sue CrowdStrike to recoup some of its losses.[133] On 8 August, Delta confirmed in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that over 7,000 flights had been cancelled over five days, and estimated its losses at $380 million in lost revenue and $170 million in expenses (adding up to about $550 million).[134] Delta also estimated that around 1.3 million passengers had been affected by the flight cancellations.[135]\n\nUnited Airlines' smaller number of cancellations had a significant impact on its hubs. For example, San Mateo County hotels around San Francisco International Airport rapidly filled up with travellers on 19 July.[136] Guests reported difficulty with checking into the local Marriott hotel because Marriott International was also recovering from the outage.[136]\n\nSouthwest Airlines (the third largest US major airline by domestic passengers) was entirely unaffected. A Southwest spokesperson confirmed that the airline had seen no impact from the CrowdStrike outage but refused to confirm speculation among aviation industry analysts that it had been shielded by its notoriously outdated software.[137]\n\nThe flight delays meant that many people who had traveled to the 2024 Republican National Convention—which concluded the day the outages started—were stuck in the convention's host city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[138][139]\n\nMontréal–Trudeau International Airport and Toronto Pearson International Airport were affected in Canada, and Porter Airlines cancelled all flights.[140] Vancouver International Airport was also reportedly affected in Canada, although it was unclear whether this was directly related to the global outages.[141]\n\nFinance\n\n[edit]\n\nMicrosoft and CrowdStrike stocks fell as a result of the outage. CrowdStrike's stock fell more than 11% on 19 July, although Microsoft stock was down less than 1%.[142][5]\n\nBanks that were affected included Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, Capital One and Charles Schwab in the US;[143] RBC, Scotiabank, and TD Bank in Canada;[144][146] Capitec Bank and other South African banks;[27] several Israeli banks;[147] and several banks in the Philippines, including RCBC, Metrobank, LandBank, BDO, UnionBank, BPI, and PNB.[148][149] E-wallets such as Maya and GCash also experienced problems in the Philippines.[150] The website and mobile banking application of DenizBank in Turkey could not be accessed.[151] Visa was affected.[41] Numerous Singaporean companies, including Singapore Exchange (SGX) and DBS Bank, reported various levels of service difficulties throughout 19 July.[68][69]\n\nIn India, the Reserve Bank of India said that only 10 banks and NBFCs were affected by the outage;[152][153] few banks use CrowdStrike tools and many banks' critical systems do not run on the cloud. NSE, BSE,[153] and India's largest bank, State Bank of India, said they were unaffected.[154]\n\nIn Brazil, Bradesco Bank confirmed it was affected. During the morning customers were able to login, but at 12:00 UTC the bank disabled the login button.[155]\n\nNew Zealand banks ASB and Kiwibank were affected, while Australian banks Westpac[58] and ANZ also had problems.[61] Apps of Australian banks NAB, Westpac, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, Bendigo Bank, and Suncorp were affected.[5]\n\nThe London Stock Exchange, while operating normally, was unable to push news updates to its website.[54] English gambling company Ladbrokes Coral and English supermarket chain Morrisons also reported problems.[54] Polish banks, including Santander Bank Polska, ING Bank Śląski and mBank, encountered issues related to the outage. Santander BP's helpline, video, and chat services were affected. PKO Bank Polski clarified that its iPKO and IKO services were stable, but other banks faced difficulties.[156] In Finland, OP Financial Group reported minor disruptions on investment partner and stock savings accounts.[157] Sense Bank in Ukraine experienced outages due to the update.[158]\n\nParaguayan banks Ueno and Banco Continental were affected; their customers were unable to log in.[159]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security, NASA, Federal Trade Commission, National Nuclear Security Administration, Department of Justice, and Department of Education were affected, and the Department of the Treasury and Department of State reported minor disruptions. The Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Energy experienced disruptions, but it is not currently known if they are related to the incident.[160] DMV agencies for the states of Georgia, Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee, and the District of Columbia were affected.[161][162][163] Ted Wheeler, the mayor of Portland, Oregon, declared the outages to be a city emergency.[164][165] Election and voting registration databases in Arizona, South Dakota, Texas and the state of Washington were affected.[166] The website for the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, went down.[167]\n\nIn the United States, there were outages in 911 service or disruptions in 911 call centres' operation in some parts of Alaska,[168] Arizona,[169] Florida,[170] Iowa,[171] Indiana,[172] Kansas,[173] Michigan,[174] Minnesota,[175] New York,[176] Ohio,[177] Oregon,[178] Pennsylvania,[179] and Virginia.[171] 911 was down for all of New Hampshire.[180][181] In addition, Alaska was experiencing issues with non-emergency call centres.[181] Many call centres switched to working backup systems.[166]\n\nThe CM/ECF and PACER computer systems used by the US federal courts were unaffected.[182] However, several state courts reported problems with their computer systems, including courts in Alaska, California, Delaware, Idaho, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New York, and Pennsylvania.[182] In New York City, courts and correctional facilities were disrupted, delaying a hearing in the trial of Harvey Weinstein for sex offenses.[40]\n\nGovernment websites in the Philippines, such as the website of the House of Representatives of the Philippines, were down due to the outage.[183]\n\nIn Canada, services in Toronto were affected,[184] and Canada Child Benefit payments were delayed.[185][186] New Zealand Parliament had problems.[81] Sunshine Coast Council was one of several councils affected in Australia.[5] The National Security Authority spokesman confirmed several institutions in Slovakia were affected.[187]\n\nThe fire department in Copenhagen, Denmark, was unable to receive automatic fire alerts from buildings.[188]\n\nGround transport\n\n[edit]\n\nTraffic disruptions were reported at the US–Canada border,[189][185] including long delays at the Ambassador Bridge and Detroit–Windsor tunnel between Ontario and Michigan.[184] The Canada Border Services Agency blamed a partial outage of its telephone reporting system which was later resolved.[140][189] There were long delays and police advised motorists to avoid the area.[190] The Washington Metro Area Transit Authority suffered minor service delays in the early morning in America; their website/live tracking was unavailable until around 9:30 am on 19 July.[191] The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in Boston, as well as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York, lost vehicle tracking and arrival notices for passengers.[192] Most of North American freight and passenger train operators went largely unaffected aside from some technical issues within Union Pacific and Canadian Pacific Kansas City, Amtrak was mostly unaffected aside from issues with credit card processing during the morning.[193]\n\nMalaysia's railway operator, Keretapi Tanah Melayu, confirmed that its KITS ticketing system was experiencing technical issues.[194] Transport for Ireland said its apps were down due to the outage.[195] Ireland's Road Safety Authority said it was experiencing \"significant disruption\" to its National Car Test (NCT) centres.[196] In Singapore, the entrance and exit gantries of over 185 car parks managed by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) were affected.[197]\n\nFuel stations have also been affected in Australia, with people stuck at fuel pumps unable to pay for petrol because payment systems were not working.[58] Auckland Transport's HOP card in New Zealand had problems.[61] Australian freight train operator Aurizon was affected.[5] Regional trains in New South Wales, Australia on the Hunter Line and the Southern Highlands Line were cancelled or delayed with the Regional Bus and Train network in Victoria operated by V/Line having all lines suspended.[5][198]\n\nUK rail companies were also affected.[110][199] Cab riders in London could not pay with credit or with debit cards and thus required cash.[54] In Sweden[200] and Belgium,[201] tickets for public transport could not be sold, and Keolis Nederland experienced issues.[87][104]\n\nHealthcare\n\n[edit]\n\nMany hospitals across North America paused non-urgent surgeries and visits.[202] Some affected hospitals, while remaining open, had limited, if any, access to patient records.[203] In the United States, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center postponed all procedures that required anaesthesia, the Mass General Brigham hospital system cancelled all non-emergency procedures and medical visits,[204][205] and the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center was also affected.[16] University Health Network experienced technical issues in Canada, saying hospitals' clinical activity would continue but warning that appointments may be delayed.[189] A number of other Canadian hospitals faced difficulties, with Newfoundland and Labrador Health Services activating contingency plans as patient record systems were affected.[190] LabCorp[206] and Quest Diagnostics[207] were affected by the outage. Kaiser San Jose Medical Center lost access to patient records, as well as systems that monitored newborn baby's vital signs, and the security systems to keep babies from being taken.[208] Other hospitals lost surveillance cameras and the ability for employee badges to unlock secure areas.[208] England's National Health Service (NHS) said that the issues are \"causing disruption in the majority of [English] GP practices\",[27] with some of its services, such as GP surgeries, which rely on a software product called EMIS Web, unable to view and manage medical records, issue and manage prescriptions, or make appointments.[54] Manx Radio reported that GP surgeries were affected in the Isle of Man.[209] The London Ambulance Service experienced an unprecedented surge[54] in 999 and 111 calls following the outage, responding to 4,500 emergency calls by 17:00 (BST).[210]\n\nTwo-thirds of Northern Ireland's general practices (GPs) were affected. At hospitals radiation therapy, bookings for operating theatres, and staff rosters are also affected.[54]\n\nIn Belgium, FPS Public Health said the outage disrupted new-patient admissions in two hospitals, which activated their emergency IT plans.[211] Two hospitals in Lübeck and Kiel, Germany, cancelled non-emergency operations.[54] The Spanish regional governments of Aragon, Basque Country, Castilla-La Mancha, Catalonia, and Galicia reported problems with their healthcare services.[212] Hospital Fernando Fonseca [pt] in Portugal reported problems,[213] while the Catholic Health system in New York experienced outages that caused delays in services.[16]\n\nIn the Netherlands, the outages affected two hospitals—the Scheperziekenhuis in Emmen and the Slingeland Ziekenhuis in de Achterhoek—and numerous emergency aid stations were also affected, including those in Emmen, Hoogeveen, and Stadskanaal.[214]\n\nSystems in Wesley Hospital and St Andrews Hospital in Brisbane, Australia, were affected.[58]\n\nThe Central Health information system in Croatia was affected, although it was clarified that it was due to a concurrent issue tied with moving their servers to a new location.[215]\n\nIn Israel, Magen David Adom and its emergency service hotline was affected. Hospitals including Sheba Medical Center, Rambam Hospital and Laniado Hospital were experiencing problems that led to longer waiting times and delayed surgeries.[147]\n\nThe pharmaceutical company Krka in Slovenia suffered a full production outage and sent its workforce home.[216]\n\nMedia and communications\n\n[edit]\n\nNumerous American TV stations were unable to broadcast because of the global outage. KSHB-TV, one of the affected stations, had to resort to airing national news via Scripps News.[66] ESPN was unable to air the morning editions of SportsCenter on the morning of the outage in America, instead airing ESPN Radio's Unsportsmanlike, simulcasting with ESPN2.[217][self-published source?] ESPN and ESPN2 later simulcasted Get Up! and First Take in place of SportsCenter, albeit without on-air graphics or b-roll.[218][219] Various Paramount channels were also affected including Nicktoons (with its West Coast feed switching to an old emergency feed), TeenNick, BET Her, NickMusic and most channels on the Pluto TV service. MeTV Toons was sent off the air for five and a half hours. Mercedes AMG PETRONAS F1 Team (which is sponsored by CrowdStrike) also suffered issues on the Friday of the Hungarian Grand Prix, with a Mercedes spokesperson confirming that the team had to manually address the problem on every computer it used. The issue also affected their engine customers, McLaren, Aston Martin and Williams.[220] Many video screens in New York City's Times Square turned off.[221]\n\nWhen some companies let their employees go home early as a result of the incident,[222] the topic \"Thank you Microsoft for an early vacation\" momentarily became Weibo's most popular term.[223] Universal Studios Japan announced that they would not be selling tickets via ticket booths over the weekend due to the outage; however, tickets would still be sold online or via designated ticket sales sites.[66]\n\nVodafone experienced outages.[158] The issue affected the office laptops of DPG Media Belgium – which impacts JOE and QMusic Radio, banks, post services, and government agencies.[211] Telephone communication with the urban services in Antwerp were also affected.[224] The Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium stated that the impact in Belgium was limited.[211] Sky News was unable to broadcast live in the UK,[225] as was the BBC's CBBC, a free-to-air children's television channel.[54] Irish national broadcaster RTÉ said its newsroom was hit by \"intermittent internet outages\" with minimal impact to output.[226][227] The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was also affected.[140]\n\nSeveral French TV channels affected by the issues include TF1, TFX, LCI and Canal+ Group networks.[228] Phone and internet service provider Bouygues Telecom has also announced the unavailability of its customer service as a result of the outage.[229] The operations of the 2024 Summer Olympics, scheduled to start the following week in Paris, France, were also affected. The outage occurred a day after the Olympic Village opened and organisers were processing the arrivals of athletes and delegates. The organising committee said that a contingency plan was activated and that only the delivery of uniforms and accreditations were affected.[230] The incident slowed down the operations, with the accreditation desk at the press centre closed and security checks done manually using a list of names.[54][231]\n\nIT workers and the BPO industry were affected in the Philippines.[232] Numerous Singaporean companies, including SPH Media, Singtel, and M1, reported various levels of service difficulties throughout the day on 19 July.[68][69]\n\nAustralian media firms affected by the issues include the ABC, SBS, Seven Network and Nine Network.[39] Ticketing at Docklands Stadium for Friday night's Australian Football League match between the Essendon Bombers and the Adelaide Crows was affected.[198]\n\nIsrael Post was affected[147] and Ukrainian Nova Poshta experienced outages.[158] In the US, UPS and FedEx were affected.[233]\n\nSim racing service iRacing was also affected by the outage in America.[234] Various Korean online games, like Black Desert Online, Ragnarok Online, and Ragnarok Origin shut down.[235]\n\nAmazon Web Services, eBay, Google Cloud, Instagram, and Plenty of Fish were also affected.[41][16]\n\nRetail\n\n[edit]\n\nSupermarkets in the Philippines were affected due to crashed POS systems.[236][dubious – discuss] German supermarket chain Tegut closed some of its stores.[237] Customers experienced payment problems at Foodstuffs and Woolworths supermarkets in New Zealand.[61] Coles was also affected.[5] British grocery chain Waitrose could only accept cash from customers.[238] Self-checkout and online order systems at some Australian retailers and fast food chains were out of service.[39]\n\nThe mobile application of the Starbucks coffee chain was limited to basic viewing of accounts made before the update; ordering was limited to in-store purchases only; some outlets saw cash register software crashes.[239]\n\nIn the United States, sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods closed some of its stores and saw temporary outages to its website.[240][241]\n\nConvenience store chain 7-Eleven experienced problems at Speedway locations that still used BlueCube and Radiant Site Manager dating from the days Speedway was owned by Marathon Petroleum Corporation, with some stores unable to accept credit or debit transactions while others were closed outright.[242]\n\nIn Norway, the pharmacy chain Apotek1 and the insurance company Tryg suspended services; the Vitusapotek and Boots pharmacy chains were also affected.[243][244] Norway experienced little further impact because of CrowdStrike's limited market share in the country.[245]\n\nAmazon saw disruption to its warehouse operations and internal software. An app used in Amazon warehouses to manage schedules and time-off requests called 'A to Z' was taken down by the outage and an internal service called 'Anytime Pay' became unavailable to employees. Operations were briefly halted at some sites, while Amazon's trucking operations were disrupted, with drivers saying a platform they use called 'Relay' suffered issues meaning they were briefly unable to pick up loads at warehouses.[246]\n\nOther sectors\n\n[edit]\n\nThe outage affected terminal operations at DCT Gdańsk, a major container hub in the Baltic port of Gdańsk in Poland.[247] Shipping ports in the US were unaffected for the most part, although the Port of Houston (which handles the most foreign tonnage) closed briefly.[248]\n\nIn Sweden, the Malmberget mine was evacuated as a precaution.[249] Tickets for soccer games could not be sold.[250]\n\nIn the United States, security provider ADT was affected.[41]\n\nIn Germany, Tesla halted production at its Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg for about four hours.[251]\n\nResponse\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a live interview on NBC's Today, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologised to the public. He said company leaders were \"deeply sorry for the impact that we've caused to customers, to travellers, to anyone affected by this, including our companies\".[252] CrowdStrike warned that malicious actors might try to pose as its staff or independent researchers claiming to help fix the problem.[253]\n\nCrowdStrike offered $10 UberEats vouchers to some employees at companies that sell and support its software as thanks for helping Crowdstrike customers recover, prompting ridicule given the costs associated with the outage.[254] Uber flagged the code as suspicious as it was used so frequently, so it did not work for some users.[255]\n\nCrowdStrike won the 2024 Pwnie Awards for the Most Epic Fail,[256] which CrowdStrike president Michael Sentonas accepted in person at DEF CON's annual Pwnie Awards show.[257] A parody website named ClownStrike was created in the aftermath of the incident; CrowdStrike later sent a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice to the owner of the site.[258]\n\nPolitical\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Australian government held a national emergency meeting to address the outage. The National Coordination Mechanism was activated; Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, \"I understand Australians are concerned about the outage that is unfolding globally and affecting a wide range of services. My Government is working closely with the National Cyber Security Coordinator\".[61][259] He later said, \"There is no impact to critical infrastructure, government services, or Triple-0 services at this stage\".[260] Victorians were advised to call Triple-0 if a fire alarm sounds or smoke is detected, as some automatic alarms in buildings may not automatically call fire services due to the outage.[5]\n\nUnited States president Joe Biden's administration was in touch with CrowdStrike to offer assistance, and on 23 July, Kurtz was invited to appear before Congress to explain how the outage occurred and what CrowdStrike was doing to prevent future incidents.[66]\n\nThe UK government's COBR committee met to discuss the incident.[261]\n\nIndia's Minister of Information and Technology Ashwini Vaishnav said that the government was in touch with Microsoft. The government's cybersecurity agency CERT-IN classified the incident as \"critical\".[262]\n\nIn Russia, the government noted that the sanctions and boycotts placed on Russia as a result of its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had unintentionally shielded it from the outage.[263] Russia's Digital Communications Ministry said, \"At the moment, the ministry has not received reports of system failures at Russian airports,\" and \"The situation with Microsoft once again shows the importance of import substitution of foreign software, primarily at critical information infrastructure facilities.\" The Russian Federal Air Transport Agency confirmed that no domestic airlines were affected.[263] The Kremlin stated that its systems were working as normal.[263]\n\nAn editorial in the Chinese state-run Global Times suggested a need for decreased dependency on Western firms, stating that reliance on \"top companies to lead network security efforts\" can introduce security risks and noting the perceived irony of the United States leading global security efforts while major companies monopolise the industry.[264]\n\nIndustry\n\n[edit]\n\nCybersecurity consultant Troy Hunt called the incident the \"largest IT outage in history\", adding: \"This is basically what we were all worried about with Y2K, except it's actually happened this time\".[265][266] Slate described it as \"Y2K Lite\".[267] News reporters have used the term \"digital pandemic\" to describe the outage.[268][269][270][271]\n\nElon Musk—CEO of Tesla, X Corp, Neuralink, and SpaceX—posted on X that CrowdStrike has been \"deleted from all our systems\".[272]\n\nAirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes demanded answers and compensation for millions of dollars in revenue he said the company had lost in the incident.[273]\n\nChinese cybersecurity companies such as 360 Security, QAX and Tencent took advantage of the CrowdStrike incident to promote their own software.[274]\n\nCriminal\n\n[edit]\n\nGovernments worldwide and cybersecurity agencies warned of digital phishing scams after the incident. Cyber criminals started sending phishing emails purporting to be CrowdStrike support and impersonating CrowdStrike staff in phone calls shortly afterward.[275][276][277]\n\nAnalysis\n\n[edit]\n\nCause\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 19 July update was an instance of a template that was tested and released in March 2024 as part of an update to the Falcon Sensor software. This new instance, Channel File 291, passed validation due to a bug in CrowdStrike's content verification software.[278][14] The Falcon Sensor itself parses the file differently in a way that led to a software crash in kernel mode.\n\nCentralisation and homogeneity\n\n[edit]\n\nThe outage raised questions about oligopoly and centralisation in the information technology sector.[279][280] The majority of the world's computers use Microsoft Windows, creating a monoculture that reduces resiliency.[140][280] Ciaran Martin, a cybersecurity expert, said, \"This is a very, very uncomfortable illustration of the fragility of the world's core internet infrastructure\".[140] Critical infrastructure expert Gregory Falco said, \"Cybersecurity providers are part of this homogenous backbone of modern systems and are so core to how we operate that a glitch in their operations will have similar impacts to failures in systems that are household names\".[281] Security experts suggested more redundancy to avoid single points of failure,[279] wider use of decentralised and heterogeneous federated systems,[280] and public anger at the failure of political leaders to regulate for diversity and competition.[140] Conversely, cybersecurity expert Andrew Plato argued that monocultures are a net positive, “from a security perspective, there’s actually a lot of benefits to running a smaller, standardized set of software, because it allows you to spot a problem quicker and easier.\"[282]\n\nIT practices\n\n[edit]\n\nExperts speculate that the update was not put through routine patch management procedures (testing the update in a sandbox) to verify there were no problems.[283]\n\nMandating disclosure of breaches and vulnerabilities has also been suggested.[284] In an interview with Wired, cybersecurity consultant Jake Williams said that this outage has \"shown why pushing updates without IT intervention is unsustainable,\" and that \"people may now demand changes in this operating model.\"[285]\n\nOperating system design and antitrust enforcement\n\n[edit]\n\nMicrosoft blamed a 2009 antitrust agreement with the European Union that they said forced them to sustain low-level kernel access to third-party developers.[286][287][288] The document does not explicitly state that Microsoft has to provide kernel-level access, but says Microsoft must provide access to the same APIs used by its own security products.[287] The EU rejected the allegations. The European Commission spokesperson told Euronews that \"Microsoft is free to decide on its business model. It is for Microsoft to adapt its security infrastructure to respond to threats in line with EU competition law. Additionally, consumers are free to benefit from competition and choose between different cybersecurity providers.\"\n\nThe spokesperson also said that \"the incident was not limited to the European Union and that Microsoft has never raised any concerns about security with the Commission either before or after the incident.\"[289]\n\nIn Linux, it is possible to use eBPF instead of kernel modules to program this type of software.[290]\n\nSince macOS Catalina (2019), this type of software can use the Endpoint Security Framework instead of a kernel extension, and this approach has been gradually enforced.[291]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nInternet outage\n\n2000 outages: Y2K problem\n\n2010 outage: McAfee DAT 5958 update\n\nGoogle services outages (several different years)\n\n2021 Facebook outage\n\n2022 Rogers Communications outage\n\n2023 Optus outage\n\nAnticipated outages\n\nYear 2038 problem\n\nGeneral mitigations\n\nIT risk management\n\nPatch management\n\nSecurity management",
      "# [CrowdStrike Falcon Outage Exploited for Social Engineering](https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/blog/crowdstrike-falcon-outage-exploited-for-social-engineering)\nBy: The Center for Internet Security® (CIS®) Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) team at the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center® (MS-ISAC®)\n\nPublished July 26, 2024\n\nA widespread IT outage stemming from a defect found in a single CrowdStrike content update began at around 1:00 a.m. ET on July 19, 2024. The outage affected a significant number of Windows hosts globally, including direct impacts to U.S. State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial (SLTT) government entities.[1] In an official statement, CrowdStrike advised they had isolated the issue and deployed a fix.[2]\n\nWhile SLTTs continue to work to maintain critical operations and restore access to Windows-hosted systems running CrowdStrike Falcon sensors, the CIS CTI team has observed cyber threat actors (CTAs) exploiting the situation to tailor phishing lures, typosquatted1 domains, and a malicious archive ZIP file posing as CrowdStrike support and legitimate CrowdStrike infrastructure.3 The CIS CTI team will continue to monitor related threat context and actively disseminate observed context and indicators of compromise (IOCs) through the MS-ISAC indicator sharing program and the Malicious Domain Blocking and Reporting (MDBR) service.4\n\nIn this blog post, the CIS CTI team will detail the threat activity it observed in the first few days following the CrowdStrike Falcon outage.\n\nThe Impact of the CrowdStrike Falcon Outage on SLTTs\n\nThe MS-ISAC initially observed significant disruptions to SLTT members’ systems, and it expects some organizations to continue to experience disruptions while administrators work to effectively deploy CrowdStrike’s fix.2 Reporting indicates there were significant disruptions to airlines, railways, healthcare, and financial institutions. Reports also noted that a few 911 centers relied on backup systems to receive emergency calls, not to mention additional reported impacts to other SLTT subsectors.5\n\nThis incident highlights the potential scale of disruption to SLTTs and critical infrastructure when their systems partially depend on a single vendor. CTAs are almost certain to further recognize these dependencies and leverage that insight to inform future cyber attacks.\n\nCTAs' Attempts to Abuse the CrowdStrike Incident\n\nThe CIS CTI team identified CTAs standing up infrastructure, such as recently created domains imitating CrowdStrike. Those domains are likely designed for social engineering to take advantage of the urgency and uncertainty of the situation. Generally, they follow a common theme of posing as authorized CrowdStrike infrastructure and support.\n\nAdditionally, CrowdStrike Intelligence released a report on July 20, 2024, detailing that they had observed CTAs delivering a malicious ZIP archive containing HijackLoader posing as a legitimate hot fix file.6 The CIS CTI team assesses that IOCs at the end of this report are likely not associated with CrowdStrike and could be used for malicious purposes.\n\nIn the past, the CTI team has observed CTAs leveraging chaotic situations and a heightened sense of urgency to socially engineer unsuspecting users into visiting malicious websites and responding to phishing emails that mimic legitimate entities.7, 8\n\nImpacted Sectors\n\nDuring the initial disruption, the CrowdStrike content update caused interruptions to several SLTT subsectors and other sectors posing downstream impacts to SLTTs. Some examples are listed below:\n\nGovernment administrative functions9\n\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles in several locations10, 11, 12\n\nThe Social Security Administration13\n\nReports indicate “some computers” at the Department of Justice (DOJ) were impacted14\n\nMass transit systems\n\nA major metro rail system suffered disruptions but has since recovered15\n\nHospitals/Healthcare16, 17\n\nAt least 11 health systems reported that the disruption impacted their ability to administer care\n\nSome of these disruptions resulted in canceled surgeries or diverted ambulances\n\nAir travel18, 19\n\nAccording to Flightaware, as of July 19, 2024, at 12:56 p.m. ET:\n\nTotal delays: 31,307\n\nTotal delays within, into, or out of the United States: 6,169\n\nTotal cancellations: 3,566\n\nTotal cancellations within, into, or out of the United States: 2,219\n\nFinancial Services20\n\nPayment systems21, 22\n\nPharmacies23\n\nResulting in the inability to dispense medication\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nThe following IOCs include likely malicious domains CIS CTI analysts identified that pose as legitimate CrowdStrike infrastructure.\n\nLikely Typosquatted CrowdStrike

      "# [CrowdStrike outage explained: What caused it and what’s next by Sean Michael Kerner, Alexander Culafi, Alex Scroxton, Ed Moyle on 2024-10-29](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Explaining-the-largest-IT-outage-in-history-and-whats-next)\nWhat might be considered the largest IT outage in history was triggered by a botched software update from security vendor CrowdStrike, affecting millions of Windows systems around the world. Insurers estimate the outage will cost U.S. Fortune 500 companies $5.4 billion.\n\nThe outage occurred July 19, 2024, with millions of Windows systems failing and showing the infamous blue screen of death (BSOD).\n\nCrowdStrike -- the company at the core of the outage -- is an endpoint security vendor whose primary technology is the Falcon platform, which helps protect systems against potential threats in a bid to minimize cybersecurity risks.\n\nIn many respects, the outage was a real manifestation of fears that computing users had at the end of the last century with the Y2K bug. With Y2K, the fear was that a bug in software systems would trigger widespread technology failures. While the CrowdStrike failure was not Y2K, it was a software issue that did, in fact, trigger massive disruption on a scale that has not been seen before.\n\nWhat caused the outage?\n\nThe CrowdStrike Falcon platform is widely used by organizations of all sizes across many industries. It is the pervasiveness of CrowdStrike's technology and its integration into so many mission-critical operations and industries that amplified the effect.\n\nThe outage was not a Microsoft Windows flaw directly, but rather a flaw in CrowdStrike Falcon that triggered the issue.\n\nFalcon hooks into the Microsoft Windows OS as a Windows kernel process. The process has high privileges, giving Falcon the ability to monitor operations in real time across the OS. There was a logic flaw in Falcon sensor version 7.11 and above, causing it to crash. Due to CrowdStrike Falcon's tight integration into the Microsoft Windows kernel, it resulted in a Windows system crash and BSOD.\n\nThe flaw in CrowdStrike Falcon was inside of a sensor configuration update. The sensor is regularly updated -- sometimes multiple times daily -- to provide users with mitigation and threat protection.\n\nThe flawed update was contained in a file that CrowdStrike refers to as \"channel files,\" which specifically provide configuration updates for behavioral protections. Channel file 291 is an update that was supposed to help improve how Falcon evaluates named pipe execution on Microsoft Windows. Named pipes are a common type of communication mechanism for interprocess communications on Microsoft Windows.\n\nWith channel file 291, CrowdStrike inadvertently introduced a logic error, causing the Falcon sensor to crash and, subsequently, Windows systems in which it was integrated.\n\nThe flaw isn't in all versions of channel file 291. The problematic version is channel file 291 (C-00000291*.sys) with timestamp 2024-07-19 0409 UTC. Channel file 291 timestamped 2024-07-19 0527 UTC or later does not have the logic flaw. By that time, CrowdStrike had noticed its error and reverted the change. But, for many of its users, that reversion came too late as they had already updated, leading to BSOD and inoperable systems.\n\nIn terms of how the logic error was introduced into the Falcon sensor, the issue was a failure in the CrowdStrike development process. On July 24, 2024, the company issued a preliminary Post Incident Review (PIR). According to the PIR, there was a flaw in CrowdStrike's Content Validator component, used to check the integrity of rapid response content update. That flaw enabled the faulty version of channel file 291 to pass validation, even though it had an error.\n\nOn Aug. 6, CrowdStrike provided even more details on how the flaw was introduced, with a 12-page root cause analysis report. The report explained that part of the root cause was a mismatch between the number of input fields in the IPC (Inter-Process Communication) Template Type used for the channel file 291 update and the actual inputs provided by the sensor code. The IPC Template Type defined 21 input fields, but the sensor code only provided 20. A runtime array bounds check was missing in the Content Interpreter, and the Content Validator contained a logic error. The conditions that led to those errors were both patched by CrowdStrike after July 19, 2024. Bounds checking came into the system on July 25, 2024, while a patch that validates the number of actual inputs went into production July 27, 2024.\n\nHow CrowdStrike aims to prevent future incidents\n\nOn Sept. 23, 2024, CrowdStrike testified in a U.S. House of Representatives hearing held by the House Subcommittee on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection.\n\nDuring the hearing, Adam Meyers, senior vice president of counter adversary operations at CrowdStrike, apologized to Congress for the outage. Meyers clarified the outage was not due to a cyberattack, but rather a result of a rapid response content update aimed at addressing new threats.\n\nDuring his testimony, Meyers detailed how CrowdStrike has changed its content update procedures to prevent similar incidents in the future:\n\nUpdates are now treated like code updates, with internal testing and phased implementation.\n\nA new \"system of concentric rings\" approach for rolling out updates has been implemented.\n\nCustomers can now choose their level of update adoption: early adopter, general availability or opt-out/delay.\n\nWhat services were affected?\n\nMicrosoft estimated that approximately 8.5 million Windows devices were directly affected by the CrowdStrike logic error flaw. That's less than 1% of Microsoft's global Windows install base.\n\nBut, despite the small percentage of the overall Windows install base, the systems affected were those running critical operations. Services affected include the following.\n\nAirlines and airports\n\nThe outage grounded thousands of flights worldwide, leading to significant delays and cancellations of more than 10,000 flights around the world. In the United States, affected airlines included Delta, United and American Airlines. These airlines were forced to cancel hundreds of flights until systems were restored. Globally, multiple airlines and airports were affected, including KLM, Porter Airlines, Toronto Pearson International Airport, Zurich Airport and Amsterdam Schiphol Airport.\n\nPublic transit\n\nPublic transit in multiple cities was affected, including Chicago, Cincinnati, Minneapolis, New York City and Washington, D.C.\n\nHealthcare\n\nHospitals and healthcare clinics around the world faced significant disruptions in appointment systems, leading to delays and cancellations. Some states also reported 911 emergency services being affected, including Alaska, Indiana and New Hampshire.\n\nFinancial services\n\nOnline banking systems and financial institutions around the world were affected by the outage. Multiple payment platforms were directly affected, and there were individuals who did not get their paychecks when expected.\n\nMedia and broadcasting\n\nMultiple media and broadcast outlets around the world, including British broadcaster Sky News, were taken off the air by the outage.\n\nAnalysis of the CrowdStrike outage\n\nIn this podcast, TechTarget Security editors Rob Wright, Alex Culafi and Arielle Waldman assess last week's CrowdStrike outage and the organization's response.\n\nLegal fallout\n\nIn the aftermath of the CrowdStrike incident there has been some legal fallout, including the following:\n\nShareholder class action lawsuit\n\nThe lawsuit alleges CrowdStrike made false and misleading statements about the adequacy of its software testing procedures. The suit claims the CrowdStrike share price declined after the incident. As a result, the class action suit is looking for damages on behalf of investors who held CrowdStrike shares between Nov. 29, 2023, and July 29, 2024.\n\nDelta Air Lines lawsuit\n\nDelta Air Lines filed a lawsuit against CrowdStrike on Oct. 25, 2024, over the outage that grounded thousands of flights and cost the airline approximately $500 million. Delta accuses the cybersecurity firm of negligence and causing a catastrophe. While Delta was not the only airline affected by this global IT outage, it was slower than other airlines to recover.\n\nIn response to this lawsuit, CrowdStrike sued Delta, saying they were not responsible for the mass flight cancellations. In the suit, CrowdStrike said any damages Delta suffered after the outage was primarily the result of \"Delta's own negligence.\"\n\nWhy Apple and Linux were not affected\n\nCrowdStrike's software doesn't just run on Microsoft Windows; it also runs on Apple's macOS and the Linux OS.\n\nBut the July outage only affected Microsoft Windows. The root cause of the outage was a faulty sensor configuration update that specifically affected Windows systems. The channel file 291 update was never issued to macOS or Linux systems as the update deals with named pipe execution that only occurs on the Microsoft Windows OS.\n\nThe way that the Falcon sensor integrates as a Windows kernel process is also not the same in macOS or Linux. Those OSes have different integration points to limit potential risk.\n\nHowever, there was a reported incident in June from Linux vendor Red Hat, where the Falcon sensor -- running as an eBPF program in Linux -- triggered a kernel panic. In Linux, a kernel panic is a type of crash, though typically not as dramatic as BSOD. That issue was resolved without Red Hat reporting any major incidents.\n\nThe dangers of putting all your eggs in one IT basket\n\nDiscover the possible consequences of relying on a concentrated and interconnected pool of vendors for all your infrastructure needs.\n\nWhat the Delta-Crowdstrike lawsuit may mean for IT contracts\n\nWhat happens when the IT infrastructure is too big to fail?\n\nCrowdStrike chaos shows risks of concentrated big IT\n\nCrowdStrike disaster exposes a hard truth about IT\n\nHow long will it take businesses to recover from this outage?\n\nCrowdStrike itself was able to identify and deploy a fix for the issue in 79 minutes. While CrowdStrike quickly identified and deployed a fix for the issue, the recovery process for businesses is complex and time-consuming. Among the issues is that, once the problematic update was installed, the underlying Windows OS would trigger BSOD, rendering the system inoperative using the normal boot process.\n\nIT administrators had to manually boot affected systems into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment to delete the problematic channel file 291 and restore normal operations. That process is labor-intensive, especially for organizations with many affected devices. In some cases, the process also required physical access to each machine, adding further time and effort to the process.\n\nSome businesses were able to apply the fix within a few days. However, the process was not straightforward for all, particularly those with extensive IT infrastructure and encrypted drives. The use of the Microsoft Windows BitLocker encryption technology by some organizations made it significantly more time-consuming to recover as BitLocker recovery keys were required.\n\nIt was initially estimated that it could potentially take months for some organizations to entirely recover all affected systems from the outage. As of July 29, 2024, CrowdStrike reported that approximately 99% of affected Windows sensors were back online.\n\nThe latest news on CrowdStrike's recovery efforts\n\nBitLocker workaround may offer aid for CrowdStrike customers\n\nCrowdStrike: 97% of Windows sensors back online after outage\n\nCrowdStrike outage underscores software testing dilemmas\n\nHackers take advantage of outage\n\nWhile the outage was not due to a cyberattack, threat actors have taken advantage of the incident.\n\nAccording to a blog post from CrowdStrike, the security vendor has received reports of the following malicious activity:\n\nPhishing emails sent to customers posing as CrowdStrike support.\n\nFake phone calls impersonating CrowdStrike staff.\n\nSelling scripts claiming to automate recovery from the botched update.\n\nPosing as independent researchers saying the outage was due to a cyberattack and offering remediation insights.\n\nCISA urges individuals and organizations to only follow instructions from legitimate sources and avoid opening suspicious emails and links.\n\nHow can businesses be better prepared for tech outages?\n\nThe CrowdStrike Windows outage highlighted the vulnerabilities of modern society's heavy reliance on technology. While system backups and automated processes are essential, having manual procedures in place can significantly enhance business continuity during tech outages.\n\nBut there are a few things businesses can do to be better prepared for tech outages, including the following.\n\nTest all updates before deploying to production\n\nIt has been a best practice for years to allow automated updates to ensure systems are always up to date. However, the CrowdStrike issue laid bare the underlying risk with that approach. For mission-critical systems, testing updates before deployment or having some form of staging environment before pushing updates to production might help to mitigate some risk.\n\nDevelop and document manual workarounds\n\nManual workarounds ensure critical business processes can continue even when technology fails. This approach was common before the digital age and, in the event of outage, can serve as a fallback. Documenting and practicing manual procedures can help mitigate the effect of outages, ensuring businesses can still operate and serve their customers, even during an outage.\n\nPerform disaster recovery and business continuity planning\n\nOutages happen for any number of different reasons. Having extensive disaster recovery and business continuity practices and plans in place is critical. Part of that effort should include the use of redundant systems and infrastructure to minimize downtime and ensure critical functions can switch to backup systems when needed.\n\nSean Michael Kerner is an IT consultant, technology enthusiast and tinkerer.

      "# [Tech disruptions sparked by software update highlight the fragility of globally connected technology by MATT O'BRIEN, apnews.com, matt-obrien on 2024-07-19](https://apnews.com/article/tech-outage-crowdstrike-microsoft-windows-7294e6c9356050cb095dad3353e9244c)\nAirlines, banks, hospitals and other risk-averse organizations around the world chose cybersecurity company CrowdStrike to protect their computer systems from hackers and data breaches.\n\nBut all it took was one faulty CrowdStrike software update to cause global disruptions Friday that grounded flights, knocked banks and media outlets offline, and disrupted hospitals, retailers and other services.\n\n“This is a function of the very homogenous technology that goes into the backbone of all of our IT infrastructure,” said Gregory Falco, an assistant professor of engineering at Cornell University. “What really causes this mess is that we rely on very few companies, and everybody uses the same folks, so everyone goes down at the same time.”\n\nThe trouble with the update issued by CrowdStrike and affecting computers running Microsoft’s Windows operating system was not a hacking incident or cyberattack, according to CrowdStrike, which apologized and said a fix was on the way.\n\nBut it wasn’t an easy fix. It required “boots on the ground” to remediate, said Gartner analyst Eric Grenier.\n\n“The fix is working, it’s just a very manual process and there’s no magic key to unlock it,” Grenier said. “I think that is probably what companies are struggling with the most here.”\n\nWhile not everyone is a client of CrowdStrike and its platform known as Falcon, it is one of the leading cybersecurity providers, particularly in transportation, healthcare, banking and other sectors that have a lot at stake in keeping their computer systems working.\n\n“They’re usually risk-averse organizations that don’t want something that’s crazy innovative, but that can work and also cover their butts when something goes wrong. That’s what CrowdStrike is,” Falco said. “And they’re looking around at their colleagues in other sectors and saying, ‘Oh, you know, this company also uses that, so I’m gonna need them, too.’”\n\nWorrying about the fragility of a globally connected technology ecosystem is nothing new. It’s what drove fears in the 1990s of a technical glitch that could cause chaos at the turn of the millennium.\n\n“This is basically what we were all worried about with Y2K, except it’s actually happened this time,” wrote Australian cybersecurity consultant Troy Hunt on the social platform X.\n\nAcross the world Friday, affected computers were showing the “blue screen of death” — a sign that something went wrong with Microsoft’s Windows operating system.\n\nBut what’s different now is “that these companies are even more entrenched,” Falco said. “We like to think that we have a lot of players available. But at the end of the day, the biggest companies use all the same stuff.”\n\nFounded in 2011 and publicly traded since 2019, CrowdStrike describes itself in its annual report to financial regulators as having “reinvented cybersecurity for the cloud era and transformed the way cybersecurity is delivered and experienced by customers.” It emphasizes its use of artificial intelligence in helping to keep pace with adversaries. It reported having 29,000 subscribing customers at the start of the year.\n\nThe Austin, Texas-based firm is one of the more visible cybersecurity companies in the world and spends heavily on marketing, including Super Bowl ads. At cybersecurity conferences, it’s known for large booths displaying massive action-figure statues representing different state-sponsored hacking groups that CrowdStrike technology promises to defend against.\n\nCrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz is among the most highly compensated in the world, recording more than $230 million in total compensation in the last three years. Kurtz is also a driver for a CrowdStrike-sponsored car racing team.\n\nAfter his initial statement about the problem was criticized for lack of contrition, Kurtz apologized in a later social media post Friday and on NBC’s “Today Show.”\n\n“We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,” he said on X.\n\nRichard Stiennon, a cybersecurity industry analyst, said this was a historic mistake by CrowdStrike.\n\n“This is easily the worst faux pas, technical faux pas or glitch of any security software provider ever,” said Stiennon, who has tracked the cybersecurity industry for 24 years.\n\nWhile the problem is an easy technical fix, he said, it’s impact could be long-lasting for some organizations because of the hands-on work needed to fix each affected computer. “It’s really, really difficult to touch millions of machines. And people are on vacation right now, so, you know, the CEO will be coming back from his trip to the Bahamas in a couple of weeks and he won’t be able to use his computers.”\n\nStiennon said he did not think the outage revealed a bigger problem with the cybersecurity industry or CrowdStrike as a company.\n\n“The markets are going to forgive them, the customers are going to forgive them, and this will blow over,” he said.\n\nForrester analyst Allie Mellen credited CrowdStrike for clearly telling customers what they need to do to fix the problem. But to restore trust, she said there will need to be a deeper look at what occurred and what changes can be made to prevent it from happening again.\n\n“A lot of this is likely to come down to the testing and software development process and the work that they’ve put into testing these kinds of updates before deployment,” Mellen said. “But until we see the complete retrospective, we won’t know for sure what the failure was.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Alan Suderman in Richmond, Virginia, contributed to this report.",
      "# [Don't Fall for It: Hackers Pounce on CrowdStrike Outage With Phishing Emails by Michael Kan on 2024-07-19](https://www.pcmag.com/news/dont-fall-for-it-hackers-pounce-on-crowdstrike-outage-with-phishing-emails)\nUPDATE: CrowdStrike has also spotted cybercriminals using the outage as bait to hack prospective targets. This includes \"impersonating CrowdStrike staff in phone calls,\" and \"posing as independent researchers, claiming to have evidence the technical issue is linked to a cyberattack.\"\n\nThe company's blog post lists several malicious domains that the hackers have been using.\n\n(Credit: CrowdStrike)\n\nOriginal story:\n\nWatch out for emails that claim to come from CrowdStrike. Hackers have been quick to exploit Friday’s massive IT outage by posing as the cybersecurity company behind the disruption.\n\nThe US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and UK National Cyber Security Centre issued alerts warning about phishing emails attempting to capitalize on the chaos.\n\n\"An increase in phishing referencing this outage has already been observed, as opportunistic malicious actors seek to take advantage of the situation. This may be aimed at both organizations and individuals,\" the UK agency said.\n\nThe US-based SANS Technology Institute, which promotes cybersecurity, issued a similar warning. “Some reports we have seen indicate that there may be phishing emails circulating claiming to come from ‘Crowdstrike Support’ or ‘Crowdstrike Security,’” wrote Johannes Ullrich, the dean of research at the institute.\n\n“I do not have any samples at this point, but attackers are likely leveraging the heavy media attention. Please be careful with any ‘patches’ that may be delivered this way,” he added. “One domain possibly associated with these phishing attacks is: crowdfalcon-immed-update [.] com.”\n\nThe outage represents a ripe opportunity for cybercriminals since it's affecting numerous companies, including airlines. In total, CrowdStrike has about 29,000 enterprise customers — many of which are likely scrambling to resolve Friday’s disruption\n\nCrowdStrike has issued an advisory on how companies and individual users can restore affected Windows systems, which has been sourced to a faulty software update. Nevertheless, phishing emails dressed up to look like the cybersecurity vendor could trick customers desperate for help.\n\nThe Texas Department of Information Resources added that's it's been \"receiving reports that bad actors are impersonating CrowdStrike employees to gain access credentials.\"\n\nSome cybersecurity researchers have also spotted someone registering several internet domains using the names such as “crowdstrikebluescreen[.]com,” and “crowdstrike0day[.]com” — a sign that hackers are preparing to create numerous scam websites to exploit the outage.",
      "# [CrowdStrike boss apologises before US Congress for global IT outage by BBC News on 2024-09-24](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23k4yyjxp3o)\nCybersecurity company CrowdStrike faced its biggest grilling yet over its role in July's mass global IT outage in Congress on Tuesday.\n\nAdam Meyers, a senior executive at the company, appeared before a US congressional committee to answer questions about its faulty software update that disabled millions of PCs on 19 July.\n\nThe incident knocked payment services offline, grounded flights and forced some hospitals to cancel appointments and delay operations.\n\nMr Meyers said the firm was \"deeply sorry\" for the outage that affected millions of people and is \"determined to prevent it from happening again\".\n\nCrowdStrike described the outage as the result of a “perfect storm”.\n\nLawmakers on the House of Representatives cybersecurity subcommittee pressed Mr Meyers on how it occurred in the first place.\n\n\"A global IT outage that impacts every sector of the economy is a catastrophe that we would expect to see in a movie,\" said Mark Green, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, in his opening remarks.\n\nThe Tennessee representative likened the widespread impact of CrowdStrike’s faulty content update to an attack “we would expect to be carefully executed by a malicious and sophisticated nation-state actor”.\n\nInstead “the largest IT outage in history was due to a mistake”, he said.\n\nMr Meyers said the company would continue to act on and share \"lessons learned\" from the incident to make sure it would not happen again.\n\nAmong the questions directed at Mr Meyers during the 90-minute hearing were technical queries about whether the company's software should have access to core parts of device operating systems.\n\nBut there were also more general questions about artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential impact on cybersecurity.\n\nCongressman Carlos Gimenez asked about the threat of AI writing malicious code.\n\nMr Meyers said he thought the tech was “not there yet\" but added that every day it \"gets better\".\n\nIn response to one representative's line of questioning, Mr Meyers reiterated that AI - which the company leverages to detect threats to systems - was not responsible for pushing the erroneous update that crashed computers around the world.\n\nHe said CrowdStrike releases between 10 and 12 configuration updates each day.\n\nLawmakers on the committee raised concerns about the impact of large-scale cyber events on national security, adding they could also be exploited by bad actors looking to capitalise on confusion or panic.\n\nBut all in all, Mr Meyers did not face quite the level of scrutiny that other high-level technology executives have when called to testify in Congress over apparent failings.\n\nCongressman Eric Swalwell said the committee had not gathered to “malign” the firm, while Mr Green said Mr Meyers showed an \"impressive\" degree of humility.\n\nInstead there was an emphasis on working together with the committee and government to prevent the possibility of any such further incidents in future.\n\nThe company still faces a number of lawsuits from people and businesses that were caught up in July's mass outage.\n\nSome of the people affected told BBC News it \"totally ruined\" their holidays, or caused them to lose out on business.\n\nThe firm has been sued by its own shareholders, as well as by Delta Airlines passengers left stranded by thousands of flight cancellations.\n\nDelta said it lost $500m (£374m) due to CrowdStrike's \"negligence\"."
