  "summary_markdown": "# About CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is a prominent American cybersecurity technology company headquartered in Austin, Texas. It was founded on January 1, 2011, by George Kurtz, Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/crowdstrike). The company specializes in endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services. CrowdStrike gained significant attention for its role in high-profile cyber investigations, such as the 2014 Sony Pictures hack and the 2016 Democratic National Committee cyberattacks [(Wikipedia, 2016-06-08)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike).\n\nAs of 2024, CrowdStrike reported a total revenue of $3.06 billion, reflecting a 36% increase year-over-year [(Wikipedia, 2016-06-08)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike). The company serves approximately 29,000 enterprise clients across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and government [(PCMag, 2024-07-19)](https://www.pcmag.com/news/dont-fall-for-it-hackers-pounce-on-crowdstrike-outage-with-phishing-emails). CrowdStrike's business model is primarily B2B, offering advanced cybersecurity solutions to enterprises of all sizes.\n\nCrowdStrike's flagship product is the Falcon platform, a cloud-native cybersecurity solution designed to protect endpoints and cloud workloads. The platform leverages advanced AI and real-time threat intelligence to provide accurate detections, automated protection, and elite threat hunting capabilities [(NEWSROOM, 2024-12-10)](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/news/). The company's products are distributed through direct sales and partnerships with other technology providers.\n\nOver the years, CrowdStrike has expanded its capabilities through strategic acquisitions, including Preempt Security, Humio, Bionic.ai, and Flow Security, to enhance its zero trust, log management, and cloud security offerings [(Wikipedia, 2016-06-08)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nGeorge Kurtz is the CEO of CrowdStrike and has played a crucial role in the company's growth and strategic direction. He has been instrumental in navigating the company through challenges, such as the global IT outage in July 2024, and maintaining customer trust [(Cybersecurity Dive, 2024-11-27)](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/crowdstrike-retains-customers/734203/).\n\n# News\n\n## Recent Incidents and Challenges\n\n### Global IT Outage\n\nOn July 19, 2024, a faulty update to the CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor software led to a significant global IT outage, affecting approximately 8.5 million Windows devices. This incident caused disruptions across various industries, including healthcare, banking, and air travel [(The Verge, 2024-07-19)](https://www.theverge.com/24201803/crowdstrike-microsoft-it-global-outage-airlines-banking). The update, intended to enhance security, instead triggered a logic error resulting in blue screens of death (BSOD) on affected systems [(Wikipedia, 2016-06-08)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike).\n\nThe financial impact of the outage was substantial, costing Fortune 500 companies an estimated $5.4 billion [(Wikipedia, 2016-06-08)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike). Despite the incident, CrowdStrike maintained a gross retention rate of over 97% in Q3 fiscal 2025, indicating strong customer loyalty [(Cybersecurity Dive, 2024-11-27)](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/crowdstrike-retains-customers/734203/).\n\n### Recovery and Market Performance\n\nFollowing the IT outage, CrowdStrike's stock price fell significantly but has since recovered. By January 2025, the company had regained the $30 billion in market value lost after the crisis [(PYMNTS, 2025-01-05)](https://www.pymnts.com/cybersecurity/2025/crowdstrike-claws-back-30-billion-lost-to-mass-tech-outage/). This recovery underscores the resilience of CrowdStrike's business model and its ability to retain customer trust.\n\n## Acquisitions and Partnerships\n\nCrowdStrike has been active in expanding its capabilities through acquisitions. Notable acquisitions include:\n\n- **Preempt Security** (September 2020) for $96 million, enhancing zero trust and conditional access technology.\n- **Humio** (February 2021) for $400 million, aimed at integrating log management into its offerings.\n- **Bionic.ai** (2023) and **Flow Security** (2024) for $200 million and $300 million, respectively, to bolster its cloud security capabilities [(Wikipedia, 2016-06-08)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n- CrowdStrike achieved FedRAMP authorization for new modules to secure highly regulated industries in the cloud [(Business Wire, 2025-01-08)](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250108688972/en/CrowdStrike-Achieves-FedRAMP-Authorization-for-New-Modules-to-Secure-Highly-Regulated-Industries-in-the-Cloud).\n- The company warned of a phishing scam targeting job seekers with XMRig Cryptominer [(Ravie Lakshmanan, 2025-01-09)](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/crowdstrike-warns-of-phishing-scam.html).\n\nCrowdStrike continues to be a key player in the cybersecurity landscape, with a strong focus on innovation and strategic growth through acquisitions and partnerships. Despite recent challenges, the company's proactive measures and robust customer retention rates suggest a commitment to maintaining its position as a trusted cybersecurity provider.",

First, customers can relaunch the EC2 instance from a snapshot or image taken before 9:30 PM PDT. We have also been able to confirm that the update that caused the CrowdStrike agent issue is no longer being automatically updated. Second, the following steps can be followed to delete the file on the affected instance:  \n  \n1. Create a snapshot of the EBS root volume of the affected instance  \n2. Create a new EBS Volume from the snapshot in the same availability zone  \n3. Launch a new Windows instance in that availability zone using a similar version of Windows  \n4. Attach the EBS volume from step (2) to the new Windows instance as a data volume  \n5. Navigate to \\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\drivers\\\\CrowdStrike\\\\ folder on the attached volume and delete \"C00000291\\*.sys\"  \n6. Detach the EBS volume from the new Windows instance  \n7.

We spent 36 hours changing bios to ACHI so we could get into Safemode as Raid doesn’t support safemode and now we cannot change them back without reimaging. \n\nLuckily our SCCM techs were able to create a task sequence to pull the bitlocker pwd from AD and delete the corrupted file, and so with USB keys we can boot into SCCM TS and run the fix in 3 minutes without swapping bios settings. \n\nAt the end of June, 3 weeks ago, Crowdstrike sent a corrupted definition that hung the 100,000 computers and servers at 90% CPU and took multiple 10 Minute reboots to recover. \n\nWe told them then they need to TEST their files before deploying. \n\nObviously the company ignored that and then intentionally didn’t PS1 and PS2 test this update at all. \n\nHow can anyone trust them again?

It updates like six times an hour sometimes.

We run Crowdstrike provided by our enterprise. Crowdstrike pushed an update on a Friday evening that was incompatible with up-to-date Debian stable. So we patched Debian as usual, everything was fine for a week, and then all of our servers across multiple websites and cloud hosts simultaneously hard crashed and refused to boot.\n\nWhen we connected one of the disks to a new machine and checked the logs, Crowdstrike looked like a culprit, so we manually deleted it, the machine booted, tried reinstalling it and the machine immediately crashes again. OK, let's file a support ticket and get an engineer on the line.\n\nCrowdstrike took a day to respond, and then asked for a bunch more proof (beyond the above) that it was their fault. They acknowledged the bug a day later, and weeks later had a root cause analysis that they didn't cover our scenario (Debian stable running version n-1, I think, which is a supported configuration) in their test matrix. In our own post mortem there was no real ability to prevent the same thing from happening again -- \"we push software to your machines any time we want, whether or not it's urgent, without testing it\" seems to be core to the model, particularly if you're a small IT part of a large enterprise. What they're selling to the enterprise is exactly that they'll do that.\n\n## Comment ID ldyolt6 with +5 score by [(thenoodler82, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldyolt6/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nim sure this will get lost but i found a solution for people running into bitlocker problems\n\nif you are able to pxe boot you can run command prompt to execute \"bcedit /set {default} safeboot minimal\" and it will return operation completed successfully\"\nthen you reboot log in with local admin credentials and delete the offending file \"C-00000291*.sys\" and then open cmd and run \"bcedit /deletevalue {default} safeboot\" and you should be all set\n\n## Comment ID ldzl1di with +6 score by [(dat_kodiak, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldzl1di/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nI know this won't happen - but I'd like an AMA with whomever hit the button.

Obviously whatever change it was, was likely not meant to land in the root level, and someone from (speculation here) Crowdstrike’s content deployment team probably forgot a trailing slash to the actual intended directory. Which is why a simple file delete will fix it. Has anyone analyzed the actual file yet? The only thing I’ve gathered now is that the file itself is causing memory issues and Windows is freaking out and kernel panicking the OS.\n\nEither way, it’s the fix/solution that’s so absurdly time consuming especially with the need to decrypt these business endpoints in BIOS with a bit locker key before even getting into safe mode to delete said file and then reboot again, and then bit lock again. A very tiresome manual process especially with remote users, with which doing this thousands of times over will take a long time for some businesses. Seems there are some automated ways to do this, but the decryption is not so easy. And if your company has any kind of security policy (which they would) they’re not just going to allow some open source quick fix to enter their network without the highest level of vetting and approval themselves or to create their own which would require a thorough vetting process, and would take a while to get tested and approved. And remember, Microsoft says “just turn it off and on again” because maybe the end point will reach Crowdstrike’s servers on reboot forget that a HUGE amount of these affected machines are probably airgapped or offline, segregated from certain parts of the business’s network(s) for security reasons and can’t be reached like a traditional end client. Either way, I feel for all IT staff out there having to deal with this.\n\n## Comment ID ldyznd7 with +3 score by [(ShamanOty, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldyznd7/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nWhat a wonderful day we had , thank you cloud strike you just stopped our whole production in over 60 factories , im sure no one could breach into our systems today 😁 , that's an insane security level.\n\n## Comment ID ldz15m2 with +3 score by [(verismRIP, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldz15m2/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nPraying for anyone with no immediate access to Bitlocker recovery keys.

I'm lost trying to understand:  When a new version 'n' of the sensor is released, we upgrade a selected batch of machines and do some tests (mostly waiting around :-)) to see that all is well.  Then we upgrade the rest of the fleet by OU. However, 'cause we're scaredy cats, we leave some critical kit on n-1 for longer.  And some really critical kit even on n-2.  (Yeah, there's a risk in not applying patches I know but there are other outage-related risks that we balance; forget that for now)  Our assumption is that n-1, n-2, etc are old, stable releases, and so when fan and shit collided yesterday, we just hopped on the console and did a policy update to revert to n-2 and assumed we'd dodged the bullet.  But of course, that failed... you know what they say about assumptions :-)  So in a long-winded way that leads to my three questions:  Why did the 'content update'  take out not just n but n-whatever sensors equally as effectively?  Are the n-whatever versions not actually stable?  And if the n-whatever versions are not actually stable and are being patched, what's the point of the versioning?

For Windows, it installs as a Boot-Start Driver, so it must start successfully for the OS to boot up.\n\nOne feature of Falcon is to monitor named pipe executions on Windows systems. Named Pipes are a mechanism for interprocess communication in Windows that can be exploited by malicious actors.\n\n**Error**\n\nOn July 19th, Crowdstrike published a sensor configuration update that was installed automatically on millions of systems worldwide.\n\nThe update contained an erroneous file, C-00000291\\*.sys, which is a configuration file also known as a channel file.\n\nWhen the Falcon driver accesses this configuration file, it encounters a logic error and crashes. Ultimately causing the dreaded Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).\n\n**Fix**\n\nFor individual machines:\n\n1. Boot into safe mode / Windows Recovery Environment\n2. Open Terminal in Safe Mode or select it in the Windows Recovery Environment\n3. cd to %WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\drivers\\\\CrowdStrike\n4. Delete files matching regex: C-00000291\\*.sys\n5. Reboot\n\nFor servers:\n\n1. Detach OS disk volume from the impacted server\n2. Create a snapshot/backup just in case\n3. Mount the disk onto a virtual server\n4. Repeat the steps to delete the affected files like the above\n5. Reattach the disk back onto the server.\n\n### Comment ID le2zqwv with +4 score by [(According_Oil_1865, Reddit, 2024-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/le2zqwv/) (in reply to ID le2vh46):\nNull pointer causing crash?

How can such a thing go unnoticed in such a big security-oriented company? This shows some extensive rot inside. I don't see how the company could survive without honestly admitting its mistakes in processes and management and having an open investigation.\n\nAnd I think this is a good wake-up call for all the corps that are taking a reliable company's word on slapping a single wide-spread security product onto their infra. to solve their issues may have been a miscalculation all along. You can't trust marketing nowadays. Such a product takes a lot of control and responsibility.

From all companies I know: Every rollout will be stopped immediately if the error rate hits a certain percentage. And if 100% of the clients are offline after the update, this should be also considered as error (but maybe no one thought it could be that bad). \n\nBut even before that.

We are an M365 E3 licensed org with the E5 security suite added on for users.  There is a lot of integration with MS across the solution stack, however from a management side we do not have dedicated security people that can stay on top of everything.  Yes, it is working and online, but if something major were to happen we would be looking for resources and support needs very quickly.  This is why a possible managed CS solution has been talked about. \n\nTechnically, we would still have several MS security items in place and Defender would still be online, just taking a backseat if you will to CS that is installed on workstation's and servers.\n\nI wanted to see if there is anyone that currently has a Defender solution in place and then went with CS?  If yes, what was the reason and how has it been?  If no, what was the reason?\n\nI am not sure on what the cost structure of something like this would look like, and it might not be possible, but I am gathering information and wanted to hear what others have done in this situation.\n\nThank you and I welcome any feedback or thoughts you have!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Comment ID ksqk8sc with +27 score by [(OK_SmellYaLater, Reddit, 2024-02-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1b35fbs/crowdstrike_vs_ms_defender/ksqk8sc/) (in reply to ID 1b35fbs):\nWe have run the CrowdStrike Falcon Complete on 4500 hosts for 3.5 years and are very happy with the service. Users and endpoints are a huge risk to the organization, so our selection process didn't include the option for Microsoft Defender only because we prefer a defense in depth approach with multiple layers. While Microsoft can cover all of the bases, they don't really do anything great and we don't like the thought of Microsoft \"grading their own homework\" so to speak. This is why we have added additional layers or outsourced security aspects to other vendors and 3rd parties when possible, like using Avanan for email security and Rapid7 instead of Sentinel etc.  \n\nCrowdStrike Falcon Complete is kick ass. It might be cost prohibitive if you are under 300 licenses, but the cost is absolutely worth it if you can pull it off. In the last 3+ years they have stopped 2 ransomware attacks and remediated other significant infections with very little effort on our side, if any. Their incident response team is great and have been helpful with information and assistance on incidents that weren't related to endpoints/crowdstrike. Support is amazing. I couldn't recommend them any higher.\n\n### Comment ID ksskmim with +1 score by [(WraithYourFace, Reddit, 2024-03-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1b35fbs/crowdstrike_vs_ms_defender/ksskmim/) (in reply to ID ksqk8sc):\nThat's where I wish CS would have a small business version.  We only had 155 assets, but required a minimum of 250.  We went with Sophos MDR because of this.  I think we were quoted like $50k a year for the bare minimum. \n\nDoes Falcon Complete also monitor M365 or ingest from like firewalls?  We actually used their Identity product and it's great.

Looking at tech specs, both are very similar, but Defender requires someone to love it, feed it logs, analyze events, configure and tune, etc. Simply, we don't have the time or resources to do that ourselves.\n\nCS is a significantly cheaper way of engaging a SOC   on a 24/7/365 basis which I would never be able to do in my own team. \n\nAlso, I LOVE the spotlight feature of complete.\n\n## Comment ID ksq0vr3 with +21 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-02-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1b35fbs/crowdstrike_vs_ms_defender/ksq0vr3/) (in reply to ID 1b35fbs):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID ksq3f6s with +5 score by [(OpeningFeeds, Reddit, 2024-02-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1b35fbs/crowdstrike_vs_ms_defender/ksq3f6s/) (in reply to ID ksq0vr3):\nThis does not come across that way at all.  For smaller and even medium sized orgs the Microsoft solution does look very good, and it is a good product.  \n\nThe missing item is:  Who do you call and what do you do when something happens? \n\nThe solution is an enterprise solution that is not really geared for the smaller orgs.  It does take some technical steps to get it online, make sure it is working, and keep everything good.  Then if you do see alerts, knowing what to do is the big item and how quickly can we respond?\n\nThis is why this has come up.

You should spin up a 2-week POC/demo with a 3rd party ICES like Abnormal or Avanan and you will see a huge difference with what they find. We had a 50%+ improvement in detections and false positives when we did our POC with Avanan and it was an easy sell to senior leadership with the reporting that they were able to provide.

Run both stacked (make some excludes so they are not tampering with one another), MDE has other features (exploit protection, ASR, controlled folders, network protection, etc.), I wouldn't just turn it off. Stack them and leave Defender as the primary AV registered (skip enabling Quarantine in CS prevention policies); and you have best of both worlds.

For most customers the difference lies in the ability to operate them - the tools don't provide much value if their not well configured with a 24x7 detection and response SOC behind it.\n\nI'll standby that if MS could get security well, none of us (in security) would have a job. You need check and balance. However, most customers do end up with MS as their IT will buy E5 for other reasons.\n\nWith CS Falcon complete, just note the limitations. They're great at detecting and responding to threats but that's it. If you have a problem with CS software, you call support and not the falcon team. They don't implement best practice policies either - who's going to setup identity and ensure your AD policies aligned? What if you have a question on a vulnerability spotlight detected? Crickets.

A staged approach to Windows and antivirus updates (really any update that changes the system state) should be staged even if they are virtual machines and tested for a week before deployment.\n\nWould you change your tires on your car while driving? Hell no. Why patch systems and make system driver modifications during the day? Why allow other businesses to dictate the operating state of the machines?\n\nSure, this is a software flaw, but the real issue is the usage and implementation of the software. The lack of proper system maintenance design. It seems like everyone is offloading the issue saying it’s crowdstrikes fault but really it’s poor system hygiene.\n\nSource: I have been in technology for 28 years working with everything from the electrons entering the system to the packets and video flowing out. I worked at one of the first companies to design compliant hosting rules and guidelines with card companies like visa. Our systems were very secure. We did not allow any outbound traffic. We used systems and software like tripwire to identify any system state changes that were unexpected.\n\nThis issue with crowdstrike was 100% preventable.\n\n## Comment ID leg3kdm with +2 score by [(StandardDeparture876, Reddit, 2024-07-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1e6vq04/many_windows_10_machines_blue_screening_stuck_at/leg3kdm/) (in reply to ID 1e6vq04):\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fudbejge25ed1.png?width=375&format=png&auto=webp&s=c39c2e5864131bf7b084cc0af096bea1a0054f70\n\n## Comment ID ldw0lgu with +4 score by [(Tensoneu, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1e6vq04/many_windows_10_machines_blue_screening_stuck_at/ldw0lgu/) (in reply to ID 1e6vq04):\nI'm just laughing at the whole situation....I'm a sitting duck atm.\n\n## Comment ID ldvwnjo with +2 score by [(gregarious119, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1e6vq04/many_windows_10_machines_blue_screening_stuck_at/ldvwnjo/) (in reply to ID 1e6vq04):\nSame here\n\n## Comment ID ldvxx8l with +2 score by [(JohnHurts, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1e6vq04/many_windows_10_machines_blue_screening_stuck_at/ldvxx8l/) (in reply to ID 1e6vq04):\nGermany too\n\n## Comment ID ldw1zfm with +2 score by [(timawesomeness, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1e6vq04/many_windows_10_machines_blue_screening_stuck_at/ldw1zfm/) (in reply to ID 1e6vq04):\nDefinitely crowdstrike.

It's very dangerous. For example, Simplethink is the root cause of every nuclear plant disaster, every failed government policy, and poorly architected update systems. Please be more careful to use nuance in thought.\n\nMicrosoft's FUGASWRSFF system (\"forced update global automatic simultaneous without reboot success/fail flagging\") puts the \"F.U.\" back into mission critical systems by violating the #1 rule and #2 rule of mission critical update protocols. So it's indeed a huge Microsoft issue. Bugs in updates happen all the time. Unavoidably so. In systems adhering to protocol, they get caught after affecting only the first few users.\n\nFor this bug to cause global worldwide outages requires the Microsoft FUGASWRSFF system.

This is based on two (2) observations:\n\n(1) CS said they have always followed the same process in the past without issues\n\n(2) (personal observation) When certain NAS drives get full and you modify a file, it ends up with all NULL bytes.\n\nHere's my guess on how their process was:\n\nTypically, when their content file is ready, they push it to their farm of QA test machines for testing and also to this NAS drive that's ready for deployment. And when all of their test deployments are successful, they press this BIG RED button that picks up this content file from the NAS drive for global deployment.\n\nDuring their prior deployments, this NAS drive had plenty of free space and deployments went well.  Now, when the NAS was full, upon copy, it produces a file with all NULL bytes.\n\nIn summary, the content file they tested with was not the file that got globally deployed.\n\n## Comment ID leen857 with +1 score by [(tfrederick74656, Reddit, 2024-07-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1e6vq04/many_windows_10_machines_blue_screening_stuck_at/leen857/) (in reply to ID 1e6vq04):\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zs0ks17zo3ed1.png?width=1656&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb2c912c1907c0f052c3553a8c588824a84eb53e\n\nHere's a flowchart/decision tree with (I think) the most up-to-date guidance.

If you're like us and have a bunch of servers in Azure running Crowdstrike, the past 8 hours have probably SUCKED for you! The only guidance is to boot in safe mode, but how the heck do you do that on an Azure VM??\n\nI wanted to quickly share what worked for us:\n\n1) Make a clone of your OS disk. Snapshot --> create a new disk from it, create a new disk directly with the old disk as source, whatever your preferred workflow is\n\n2) Attach the cloned OS disk to a functional server as a data disk\n\n3) Open disk management (create and format hard disk partitions), find the new disk, right click, \"online\"\n\n4) Check the letters of the disk partitions: both system reserved and windows\n\n5) Navigate to the staged disk's Windows drive, deal with the Crowdstrike files. Either rename the Crowdstrike folder at Windows\\System32\\drivers\\Crowdstrike as Crowdstrike.bak or similar, delete the the file matching “C-00000291*.sys”, per Crowdstrike's instructions, whatever\n\nFrom here, we found that if we replaced the disk on the server, we would get a winload.exe boot manager error instead! Don't dismount your disk, we aren't done yet!\n\n6) Pull up this MS Learn doc: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/windows/error-code-0xc000000e\n\n7) Follow the instructions in the document to run bcdedit repairs on your boot directory. So in our case, that meant the following -- replace F: and H: with the appropriate drive letters. Note that the document says you need to delete your original VM -- we found that just swapping out the disk was OK and we did not need to actually delete and recreate anything, but YMMV.\n\nbcdedit /store F:\\boot\\bcd /set {bootmgr} device partition=F:\n\nbcdedit /store F:\\boot\\bcd /set {bootmgr} integrityservices enable\n\nbcdedit /store F:\\boot\\bcd /set {af3872a5-<therestofyourguid>} device partition=H:\n\nbcdedit /store F:\\boot\\bcd /set {af3872a5-<therestofyourguid>} integrityservices enable\n\nbcdedit /store F:\\boot\\bcd /set {af3872a5-<therestofyourguid>} recoveryenabled Off\n\nbcdedit /store F:\\boot\\bcd /set {af3872a5-<therestofyourguid>} osdevice partition=H:\n\nbcdedit /store F:\\boot\\bcd /set {af3872a5-<therestofyourguid>} bootstatuspolicy IgnoreAllFailures\n\n8) NOW dismount the disk, and swap it in on your original VM. Try to start the VM. Success!? Hopefully!?\n\nHope this saves someone some headache! It's been a long night and I hope it'll be less stressful for some of you.\n\n## Comment ID ldwuujs with +33 score by [(SecAbove, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1e70rdw/psa_repairing_the_crowdstrike_bsod_on_azurehosted/ldwuujs/) (in reply to ID 1e70rdw):\nHere is the Official CrowdStrike KB [https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/s/article/Tech-Alert-Windows-crashes-related-to-Falcon-Sensor-2024-07-19](https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/s/article/Tech-Alert-Windows-crashes-related-to-Falcon-Sensor-2024-07-19)\n\n**Tech Alert | Windows crashes related to Falcon Sensor | 2024-07-19**\n\n**Published Date:Jul 19, 2024**\n\n# Summary\n\n* CrowdStrike is aware of reports of crashes on Windows hosts related to the Falcon Sensor.\n\n \n\n# Details\n\n* Symptoms include hosts experiencing a bugcheck\\\\blue screen error related to the Falcon Sensor.\n* Windows hosts which have not been impacted do not require any action as the problematic channel file has been reverted.\n* Windows hosts which are brought online after 0527 UTC will also not be impacted\n* This issue is not impacting Mac- or Linux-based hosts\n* Channel file \"C-00000291\\*.sys\" with timestamp of **0527 UTC or later** is the reverted (good) version.\n* Channel file \"C-00000291\\*.sys\" with timestamp of **0409 UTC** is the problematic version.\n\n \n\n# Current Action\n\n* CrowdStrike Engineering has identified a content deployment related to this issue and reverted those changes.\n* If hosts are still crashing and unable to stay online to receive the Channel File Changes, the following steps can be used to workaround this issue:\n\n# Workaround Steps for individual hosts:\n\n* Reboot the host to give it an opportunity to download the reverted channel file.  If the host crashes again, then:\n   * Boot Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment\n   * Navigate to the %WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\drivers\\\\CrowdStrike directory\n   * Locate the file matching “C-00000291\\*.sys”, and delete it.\n   * Boot the host normally.\n\nNote:  **Bitlocker-encrypted hosts may require a recovery key**.\n\n# Workaround Steps for public cloud or similar environment including virtual:\n\nOption 1:\n\n* Detach the operating system disk volume from the impacted virtual server\n* Create a snapshot or backup of the disk volume before proceeding further as a precaution against unintended changes\n* Attach/mount the volume to to a new virtual server\n* Navigate to the %WINDIR%\\\\\\\\System32\\\\drivers\\\\CrowdStrike directory\n* Locate the file matching “C-00000291\\*.sys”, and delete it.\n* Detach the volume from the new virtual server\n* Reattach the fixed volume to the impacted virtual server\n\nOption 2:\n\n* Roll back to a snapshot before 0409 UTC. \n\n \n\n# Workaround Steps for Azure via serial\n\n1.

Hovever microsoft updated their KB on [https://azure.status.microsoft/en-gb/status](https://azure.status.microsoft/en-gb/status) Copy of the MS KB below, **The TLDR - do many VM reboots (up to 15!)**\n\n## \n\nWe have been made aware of an issue impacting Virtual Machines running Windows Client and Windows Server, running the CrowdStrike Falcon agent, which may encounter a bug check (BSOD) and get stuck in a restarting state. We approximate impact started around 19:00 UTC on the 18th of July.\n\nAdditional details from CrowdStrike are available here: [Statement on Windows Sensor Update - crowdstrike.com](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-windows-sensor-update/)\n\n**Update as of 10:30 UTC on 19 July 2024:**\n\nWe have received reports of successful recovery from some customers attempting multiple Virtual Machine restart operations on affected Virtual Machines. Customers can attempt to do so as follows:\n\n* Using the Azure Portal - attempting 'Restart' on affected VMs\n* Using the Azure CLI or Azure Shell ([https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com/))\n\n\n\nWe've received feedback from customers that several reboots (as many as 15 have been reported) may be required, but overall feedback is that reboots are an effective troubleshooting step at this stage.\n\n**Additional options for recovery:**\n\nWe recommend customers that are able to, to restore from a backup from before 19:00 UTC on the 18th of July.\n\n* Customers leveraging Azure Backup can follow the following instructions:\n\n[How to restore Azure VM data in Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms)\n\n* Alternatively, customers can attempt to repair the OS disk offline by following these instructions: \n\n[Attach an unmanaged disk to a VM for offline repair](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/windows/unmanaged-disk-offline-repair)\n\n* Disks that are encrypted may need these additional instructions:\n\n[Unlocking an encrypted disk for offline repair](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/windows/unlock-encrypted-disk-offline)\n\nOnce the disk is attached, customers can attempt to delete the following file. \n\nWindows/System/System32/Drivers/CrowdStrike/C00000291\\*.sys\n\nThe disk can then be attached and re-attached to the original VM.\n\nWe can confirm the affected update has been pulled by CrowdStrike. Customers that are continuing to experience issues should reach out to CrowdStrike for additional assistance.\n\nAdditionally, we're continuing to investigate additional mitigation options for customers and will share more information as it becomes known.\n\nThis message was last updated at 11:36 UTC on 19 July 2024\n\n#### Comment ID ldxcsrh with +2 score by [(manvscar, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1e70rdw/psa_repairing_the_crowdstrike_bsod_on_azurehosted/ldxcsrh/) (in reply to ID ldx6srr):\nI noticed that my VM's do actually respond to ping for a couple seconds until they BSOD and restart again.

I have gotten our Falcon Complete team to enable it for our account/tenant so technically I have rights to access it.  But I have no idea how I go about doing that.  \n\nJust to give you an example of why I want to learn the CS API, I'd like to do something similar to how I use Excel to 'get data' from various sources like Active Directory, Exchange Server, SQL Server, text & csv files, etc.  I typically pull that data from those sources into an Excel worksheet and then sort, filter, and compare data with other data sources.  For example, I will query Active Directory for 'all computers' and query 'SolarWinds Server & Application Monitor' for all 'nodes' and have it show me all computers in AD that are not in SW SAM.  This allows me to figure out why we might not be monitoring all our computers with SW.  I could see the same application here: \"show me all computers in AD that are not in CS\".  I figured using the API was the quickest method (i'd rather not have to export the hosts file to CSV every time I wanted to run this query).\n\n## Comment ID h9xa6om with +12 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/p9egth/crowdstrike_api_for_dummies/h9xa6om/) (in reply to ID p9egth):\nThis video from Fal.Con last year helped me get started using the APIs CrowdStrike offers.

The [Asset Inventory](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/discover/discover/en-US/app/eam2/discover__asset_inventory) within Falcon Discover can be used to find devices on local subnets without the Falcon Sensor, and pulling data from there might be easier than creating your own integration.\n2. Falcon Complete reviews this data and can notify you when they think you're lacking in sensor coverage.\n\nThere are a few different resources that can help you learn how to use the APIs. The [Falcon OAuth2 API Documentation](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/documentation/46/crowdstrike-oauth2-based-apis) is the first place to go to understand what the OAuth2 APIs are. It provides links to specific APIs, examples of authentication, etc.\n\n[PSFalcon](https://github.com/crowdstrike/psfalcon) makes these APIs easier to use with PowerShell, while [falconpy](https://github.com/crowdstrike/falconpy) and [gofalcon](https://github.com/crowdstrike/gofalcon) make them easier to use with Python and Golang, respectively. If you're completely new to APIs but understand one of these languages, one of these tools will be the best place to start. If you'd like to pull this data directly with Excel, you're going to have to start from scratch, or figure out how you could use Excel to call one of these tools to get your data.\n\nPersonally, I think your easiest route would be to pull data with PSFalcon to CSV and then compare, which leads to the next question -- how do you get specific data? You'll need to understand what APIs are available, test each one and see if it contains what you want. Within PSFalcon, if you're trying to get information about devices, that's `Get-FalconHost`.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>show me all computers in AD that are not in CS\n\nI can think of a couple ways to tackle this. First, you can pull relevant device information, save it to CSV and compare it against your list from AD. The downside with this approach is that it's inefficient to pull this data every time you want it, because a lot of it probably won't change too often.\n\n    Get-FalconHost -Detailed -All | Select-Object device_id, hostname, last_seen, mac_address, local_ip, machine_domain, ou, site_name | Export-FalconReport -Path .\\Hosts.csv\n\nOr, you can pull relevant device information, save locally to a database, and compare on demand using Excel. This is a bit more complicated because you'd need to add in a way for PSFalcon to output it's data directly to a database (maybe a module like [dbatools](https://dbatools.io/)), but you could create a scheduled task to pull device data and update the database with changes.\n\nHere's a query that would pull all devices that have connected to the cloud in the last 24 hours (which could presumably have new data):\n\n    Get-FalconHost -Filter \"last_seen:>'now-24h'\" -Detailed\n\n## Comment ID h9xionr with +3 score by [(niemesrw, Reddit, 2021-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/p9egth/crowdstrike_api_for_dummies/h9xionr/) (in reply to ID p9egth):\nHighly recommend using powershell if you can.

They aggregate data from many companies to try and correlate said data. With all this AI circle jerking I guarantee they are throwing that data into AI learning. Moving and processing that sensitive data exposes it to chances to be attacked or poked for weaknesses. \n\nOne company records and stores incredibly sensitive and granular data about their employees actions, the traffic across their networks including sensitive endpoints, and pretty much a constant stream of data about the usage of all of your systems and their capabilities. I believe that almost like half the fortune 100 companies use crowdstrike. That's scary. These companies control your basic sensitive information. \n\nI mean hell every American has had our data included in Equifax credit monitoring. One would think they would have an understanding of the sensitive nature of their data. Yet the reason the hack occurred and released social security numbers and credit history? Someone didn't change the default admin password for a portal software they were using. Part of the setup process for this professional IT person was a very simple step. Change the default password. Yet. They didn't.

It's not even about tech literacy, it's just the fundamental concept of having machines that operate differently. The reason Windows was created and standardized was to solve the issue of every single proprietary workstation operating completely differently.  \n  \nIf I leave one job that uses windows, I can join another job that uses windows and not require any training. The same can't really be said for linux distros, it is fundamentally incompatible. More personalization = less standardization. Joining a new job meant countless hours of training learning how to use the proprietary workstation setup that your new company has.   \n  \nLinux is amazing as a personal workstation and playtoy, and it's amazing as a server platform, but as a ubiquitous workstation?

If you mean desktop as in the PC people login to for work or while sitting at home scrolling through Reddit then no.  However, the argument can be made that Linux has already taken over when you consider that Android dominates the market in phones/tablets and Chromebooks are what a lot of people pick up for classroom settings or for laptops.  All of which are Linux based.  Even MacOS uses an offshoot of Unix so in reality Linux has already taken over in a lot of places.   The only reason a lot of people haven't touched Linux is because of gaming and with Valve pushing for developers to make games accessible I think this will start to change.\n\n(I too use ARCH BTW) lol\n\n#### Comment ID ldxxm3o with +1 score by [(Alone-Rough-4099, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1e71kzh/windows_does_not_use_crowdstrike_certain/ldxxm3o/) (in reply to ID ldx4gmo):\nwe got the year of linux takeover before GTA 6.\n\n#### Comment ID ldy1imq with +1 score by [(snakeoilHero, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1e71kzh/windows_does_not_use_crowdstrike_certain/ldy1imq/) (in reply to ID ldx4gmo):\nUbuntu/MX/Mint for my loving computer illiterate family & friends.\n\nSince the browser became the \"killer app\" around 2008.   \nYour linux desktop meme is so 2000late.   \nMy WINE is tight, your cloud is aiight, yet no virus in sight. \n\n-Internet Poet\n\n#### Comment ID ldy517e with +1 score by [(Taira_Mai, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1e71kzh/windows_does_not_use_crowdstrike_certain/ldy517e/) (in reply to ID ldx4gmo):\nDesktop Linux and Fusion Power - always years away.\n\n#### Comment ID ldyeuw7 with +1 score by [(turbospeedsc, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1e71kzh/windows_does_not_use_crowdstrike_certain/ldyeuw7/) (in reply to ID ldx4gmo):\nEvery couple of years i end up installing linux, works great to the first days, then i need to install or modify something small ( last time it was a screenshot tool) ends up breaking all kinds of shit and starting a 8 hour long session trying to get it working again, then i format and install windows.\n\n#### Comment ID ldyiril with +1 score by [(TheKz262, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1e71kzh/windows_does_not_use_crowdstrike_certain/ldyiril/) (in reply to ID ldx4gmo):\nGlad to see we're keeping the Arch user stereotype alive .\n\n(Btw I use Windows 10)\n\n#### Comment ID le07f29 with +1 score by [(Zopieux, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1e71kzh/windows_does_not_use_crowdstrike_certain/le07f29/) (in reply to ID ldx4gmo):\nlmao he uses arch in 2024, have you heard of nixos?\n\n### Comment ID ldx7aix with +73 score by [(Tyr_Kukulkan, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1e71kzh/windows_does_not_use_crowdstrike_certain/ldx7aix/) (in reply to ID ldx0lze):\nYou can break any OS with a bad update to 3rd party software.

A couple Linux users made a small effort to help by sending me random commands to try, but most of them just said it was a Realtek issue and that I should buy new hardware. One of them even said, \"You should buy a new soundcard even if you stick with Windows, it'll save you some pain in the future,\" somehow not understanding that sound just plain works out of the box in Windows. I've never had a Windows issue with Realtek audio, ever.\n\nFun fact: the issue had nothing to do with Realtek. It was with the kernel level audio driver, ALSA, which automatically mutes one output source if you have two connected. This is completely unnecessary in modern Linux since the DE only outputs sound to whichever device you have selected, ALSA is solving a problem that doesn't exist. ALSA also doesn't make this setting visible to the higher level audio servers, PipeWire or PulseAudio, so it's literally impossible for it to appear in a GUI settings menu. You have to use the terminal to fix it.\n\nIt made me so mad, man.

The need for enterprise AV software stems largely from the fact that Windows' value is heavily derived from its backward compatibility, which requires a lot of legacy code that makes it challenging to identify and address vulnerabilities. The economics of closed source software make backward compatibility highly desirable as buying new software and replacing old software is expensive. It's not to say this sort of problem wouldn't arise at all on OSS, it's just less likely, as on OSS your attack surface is smaller and simpler to secure than on Windows so doesn't necessarily warrant such privileged access, and there's less money to be made by cybercriminals than there is targeting the billions of Windows end users worldwide so there are less attackers and therefore less attacks. TLDR: on Mac & Linux, AV doesn't have to move as fast or be as complex.\n\nBTW, despite this incident, Crowdstrike have gotten as prevalent as they are because their selling point goes beyond traditional AV to extend into a full-fledged cyber security monitoring service (i.e. SEIM, SOAR, etc) that can be purchased as a relatively low-cost SaaS subscription, and \"it just works\". Cyber security professionals are expensive as there simply aren't enough of them, so without Crowstrike or someone like them, many smaller businesses would simply have little or no security.\n\n## Comment ID ldx3rbv with +116 score by [(Hottage, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1e71kzh/windows_does_not_use_crowdstrike_certain/ldx3rbv/) (in reply to ID 1e71kzh):\nhaha windoze bad upvote pls\n\n## Comment ID ldx13wg with +56 score by [(forseeninkboi, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1e71kzh/windows_does_not_use_crowdstrike_certain/ldx13wg/) (in reply to ID 1e71kzh):\nnO wiNDoWs bAD liNuX gOOd\n\n### Comment ID ldxcn7d with +8 score by [(riba2233, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1e71kzh/windows_does_not_use_crowdstrike_certain/ldxcn7d/) (in reply to ID ldx13wg):\nUpd00ts incoming!\n\n## Comment ID ldyqu2z with +4 score by [(OwnAssignment2850, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1e71kzh/windows_does_not_use_crowdstrike_certain/ldyqu2z/) (in reply to ID 1e71kzh):\nMicrosoft/Windows is complicit for several reasons, however, those reasons have more to do with the immaturity and insecurity of systems administrators in general.

If the Crowdstrike software wants to update and reboot, it can do so. Same on Linux or Mac. It’s not using the built-in update mechanism, it’s purely a third-party application doing its own thing.\n\nAlso, for corporate environments (which is where Crowdstrike is typically used), then end user should absolutely not be in full control. The average user knows nothing about how to manage their computer, has little to no understanding of basic IT security and will install all kinds of junk on their machines.

I guess it's just how it is nowadays. Computers are so cheap you can just get a general purpose pc instead of tailoring something for your particular use case and it will still be cheaper this way. As for the alternatives, though there are a couple I can think of.\n\nAssuming you have no developers:\n\n* You can get a lightweight linux distro like armbian and install some minimal lightweight desktop like lxde. There might be caveats, though, for e.g., you need to make sure your controller has community support in case of armbian. There might even be some specialized thing for billboard that I'm not aware of like there is lakka which is made to look like a console.\n* Get a cheap android tv box and just use that. Maybe a cheap android tablet with hdmi output.\n\nI guess those doesn't differ much from the windows variant except those solutions will be a lot less resource intense. Windows iot which is marketed as an embedded solution but requires a desktop cpu which is a far cry from embedded. Perhaps, it's just that my definition of embedded differs from microsoft's and my 12 year old pc can now be considered embedded by their standards.\n\nIf you do have developers I can think of some options of varying levels of insanity:\n\n* Embedded linux, bring only the stuff you need and make your own app to display images full screen. You really don't even need a desktop manager to do that.\n* Screw operating system, bring just the kernel. Same as above except you don't need all the fancy userspace that embedded linux offers, just run fit-image with your only application instead of all the usual sysvinit. Screw x11, just fill framebuffers on your own.\n* Screw kernel, you have u-boot. Funnily enough, u-boot is pretty much an embedded operating system on its own. You can use u-boot's api to display images directly. You don't even need mmu for that.\n* [Screw everything, pure power of the signal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7rce6IQDWs)\n\nNow that I look back on all of that it might looks a little bit like linux shilling. A little. Anyway, an android box or a small pc like raspberry pi would be the first thing to come to my mind if presented with such task.\n\n### Comment ID ldykfjz with +1 score by [(redditigation, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1e71kzh/windows_does_not_use_crowdstrike_certain/ldykfjz/) (in reply to ID ldy25ek):\nSo the real reason this is funny is because even billboards are affected here in the English-speaking western side of the world.

Apple and a few of the Linux distros have pretty good documentation.

For example I would get libre writter (think ms word). In theory it's less bloated which means you can store more on your drives because you don't have programs you don't need. In practice, you probably end up running either an emulator or a translation layer for 2-3 windows programs, which don't run as well because they aren't running natively. But if you have decent hardware you probably won't even notice.\n\n#### Comment ID le3q7m4 with +1 score by [(oldelbow, Reddit, 2024-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1e71kzh/windows_does_not_use_crowdstrike_certain/le3q7m4/) (in reply to ID le3l3ff):\nYep that does sound even more hellish.\n\n#### Comment ID ledx9sm with +1 score by [(ZMcCrocklin, Reddit, 2024-07-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1e71kzh/windows_does_not_use_crowdstrike_certain/ledx9sm/) (in reply to ID le3l3ff):\nThe only thing I run using Wine is Photoshop.

Manager doesn’t directly answer question but rather sends you to other people to answer your questions. Big disconnect with senior management and employees. \nHR is actually a joke - the offer I received on the phone was not the same as the contract given. Also super picky on timing of when you should come into the office which has no direct correlation to making sales or benefiting the bottom line for the company.\n\nThey also sent the employee review form prior to make drastic company changes.",

This creates internal/external conflict and hostility. - PTO usage - despite unlimited PTO being the policy, there are managers who monitor, track and limit time off for team members. - Culture Shift: The focus on “world domination” has created a noticeable difference in morale and business operations.

Feels like a sinking ship that no one cares to fix and senior leadership is extremely disconnected from day - to - day ops.

They serve two masters: we need to fulfill our mission and keep our customers safe, but also continue to grow as fast as we can, and while our customers and Wall Street frequently overlap in what they want and need, sometimes those goals don't always align. Depending on who you ask, there are a lot of focus areas and a ton of priorities. 5 year plans. Speeches at quarterly All hands. Corporate and team goals, and it gets dizzying. The message is often unclear. - I haven't been here forever, but while CrowdStrike has a ton of great people, it's filled with more than its fair share of \"rest and vest\" pre-IPO veterans who like to sit and complain about the good ol' days, even though they don't seem to produce much at all. - To the point above, while I haven't been here forever, in the years I've been here what I have seen is a leadership pullback. As the company's grown, there have been more unannounced re-orgs, execs leaving, and this and that happening with little or reactive communication, which leaves everyone wondering what's up and looking over their shoulder. Corporate comms needs to be re-done with a much clearer focus on transparency. - There is little to no training for managers, and managers aren't evaluated at all on how good they actually are as managers, so it's kind of a roll of the dice in terms of how effective your manager is and how they'll advocate for you. - Related to the above, I cannot explain to you how and why some people get promoted and others don't. There is no track or defined process, so it's very much up in the air behind a secretive and often delayed annual merit cycle. A lot of people were frustrated this year. - Speaking of, merit raises haven't been great lately. If I end up leaving, that will be why. Please give your top performers an incentive to stay! - There's no educational reimbursement at all. - 401k is embarrassingly bad for a company of our size with the revenue we generate.",

This is my first company where I'm never bothered on the weekends or after hours. - Overall, the future is bright! - This is going to sound Kool-aidy, but it's the best cybersecurity company in the industry.

This creates internal/external conflict and hostility. - PTO usage - despite unlimited PTO being the policy, there are managers who monitor, track and limit time off for team members. - Culture Shift: The focus on “world domination” has created a noticeable difference in morale and business operations. People and process first culture has taken a backseat to being the biggest, fastest and strongest security provider. More burnout, more patchy solutions to quickly solve problems that could have been superbly implemented with proper communication and expectations set on timing.",

They serve two masters: we need to fulfill our mission and keep our customers safe, but also continue to grow as fast as we can, and while our customers and Wall Street frequently overlap in what they want and need, sometimes those goals don't always align. Depending on who you ask, there are a lot of focus areas and a ton of priorities. 5 year plans. Speeches at quarterly All hands. Corporate and team goals, and it gets dizzying. The message is often unclear. - I haven't been here forever, but while CrowdStrike has a ton of great people, it's filled with more than its fair share of \"rest and vest\" pre-IPO veterans who like to sit and complain about the good ol' days, even though they don't seem to produce much at all. - To the point above, while I haven't been here forever, in the years I've been here what I have seen is a leadership pullback. As the company's grown, there have been more unannounced re-orgs, execs leaving, and this and that happening with little or reactive communication, which leaves everyone wondering what's up and looking over their shoulder. Corporate comms needs to be re-done with a much clearer focus on transparency. - There is little to no training for managers, and managers aren't evaluated at all on how good they actually are as managers, so it's kind of a roll of the dice in terms of how effective your manager is and how they'll advocate for you. - Related to the above, I cannot explain to you how and why some people get promoted and others don't. There is no track or defined process, so it's very much up in the air behind a secretive and often delayed annual merit cycle. A lot of people were frustrated this year. - Speaking of, merit raises haven't been great lately. If I end up leaving, that will be why. Please give your top performers an incentive to stay! - There's no educational reimbursement at all. - 401k is embarrassingly bad for a company of our size with the revenue we generate.",

This is my first company where I'm never bothered on the weekends or after hours. - Overall, the future is bright! - This is going to sound Kool-aidy, but it's the best cybersecurity company in the industry.

      "# [CrowdStrike Falcon Issue ‘Fix Has Been Deployed;’ Microsoft Identifies ‘Root Cause’ Of Outage by Mark Haranas](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2024/crowdstrike-falcon-issue-fix-has-been-deployed-microsoft-identifies-root-cause-of-outage)\nThe massive Microsoft Azure and CrowdStrike outage reportedly was caused by a recent update to CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor software. Here’s where everything stands as of Friday morning.\n\nFrom emergency 911 call centers to national health-care services to the largest airlines, the Microsoft Azure and CrowdStrike outage is causing chaos around the world.\n\nAs of Friday morning, CrowdStrike said, “The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.”\n\nThe outage stemmed from a recent update to CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor software, according to Microsoft, which affected Windows 365 Cloud PCs.\n\n[RELATED: 5 Things To Know On The CrowdStrike-Microsoft Outage]\n\nCrowdStrike said it is working with “customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts. Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted. This is not a security incident or cyberattack.”\n\nThe outage reportedly first began Thursday when some Microsoft clients in the U.S., such as airlines, were hit with an outage on their Azure cloud services system.\n\nMicrosoft is urging customers affected to conduct point-in-time restore for Windows 365 Business and Enterprise. Point-in-time restore enables end users to restore a Cloud PC to the exact state it was at an earlier point in time, said Microsoft in a blog post.\n\n“To fix this, users may restore their Windows 365 Cloud PC to a known good state prior to the release of the update (July 19, 2024),” Microsoft said on X. “Windows 365 Business admins can also restore Cloud PCs to an earlier state on behalf of their users,” the company said. “Short-term restore points are saved every 12 hours.”\n\nMicrosoft Identifies Preliminary Root Cause For 365 Admin Center, Teams\n\nThe outage is still affecting many Microsoft 365 users who may still be unable to access various 365 applications and services as of Friday morning, including Teams.\n\nMicrosoft said the “preliminary root cause” was a configuration change in a portion of its Azure back-end workloads that “caused interruption between storage and compute resources, which resulted in connectivity failures that affected downstream Microsoft 365 services dependent on these connections.”\n\nMicrosoft Teams users may still be unable to leverage Microsoft Teams functions including presence, group chats and user registration. “Microsoft 365 admins may be intermittently unable to access the Microsoft 365 admin center and any action may be delayed if accessible,” the company said.\n\nMicrosoft is continuing to apply mitigation actions to provide relief from the impact affecting the remaining Microsoft 365 apps and services.\n\n“Our telemetry is indicating that the remaining impacted scenarios are progressing towards a full recovery and we’re closely monitoring to ensure this progress continues,” Microsoft said.\n\nCrowdStrike CEO Kurtz provided a statement on X Friday regarding the issue.\n\nHe said his Austin, Texas-based cybersecurity firm is working with customers impacted by the update that affected Windows hosts. Kurtz reiterated that the issue was not a “security incident or cyberattack.”\n\n“We further recommend organizations ensure they’re communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels,” Kurtz said. “Our team is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers.”\n\nMicrosoft Azure ‘Reboots’ Are Working\n\nFor Microsoft Azure, there are still service issues impacting virtual machines running Windows Client and Windows Server that are running the CrowdStrike Falcon agent, which may encounter a bug check (BSOD) and agent stuck in a restarting state.\n\n“We have received reports of successful recovery from some customers attempting multiple Virtual Machine restart operations on affected Virtual Machines,” Microsoft said. “We’ve received feedback from customers that several reboots (as many as 15 have been reported) may be required, but overall feedback is that reboots are an effective troubleshooting step at this stage.”\n\nCrowdStrike is referring customers to its support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide updates on its website.\n\n“We further recommend organizations ensure they’re communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels,” CrowdStrike said. “Our team is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers.”\n\nCustomers first began reporting issues through the Down Detector website, which data shows hit a peak at around 3 a.m. ET.",

CISA continues to work closely with CrowdStrike and other private sector and government partners to actively monitor any emerging malicious activity.\n\nAccording to a new CrowdStrike blog, threat actors have been distributing a malicious ZIP archive file. This activity appears to be targeting Latin America-based CrowdStrike customers. The blog provides indicators of compromise and recommendations.\n\nUpdate 7:30 p.m., EDT, July 19, 2024:\n\nThe CrowdStrike guidance is updated with additional guidance regarding impacts to specific environments, e.g., Azure, AWS.\n\nFor additional information:\n\nUpdate from the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK)\n\nUpdate from the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)\n\nUpdate from the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS)\n\nThreat actors continue to use the widespread IT outage for phishing and other malicious activity. CISA urges organizations to ensure they have robust cybersecurity measures to protect their users, assets, and data against this activity.\n\nCISA continues to monitor the situation and will update this Alert to provide continued support.\n\nInitial Alert (11:30 a.m., EDT, July 19, 2024):\n\nCISA is aware of the widespread outage affecting Microsoft Windows hosts due to an issue with a recent CrowdStrike update and is working closely with CrowdStrike and federal, state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) partners, as well as critical infrastructure and international partners to assess impacts and support remediation efforts. CrowdStrike has confirmed the outage:\n\nImpacts Windows 10 and later systems.\n\nDoes not impact Mac and Linux hosts.\n\nIs due to the CrowdStrike Falcon content update and not to malicious cyber activity.\n\nAccording to CrowdStrike, the issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.

Microsoft has also released a bootable USB drive tool that can help restore crashed systems.\n\nCrowdStrike, which is a cybersecurity firm based in the US, has explained that a flawed sensor configuration update was the culprit. The company blames a bug in test software for not properly validating the content update that was pushed out to millions of machines on Friday. CrowdStrike is promising to more thoroughly test its content updates, improve its error handling, and implement a staggered deployment.\n\nBanks, airlines, TV broadcasters, supermarkets, and even Starbucks had systems crashed due to the problem, and on Monday, Delta Airlines canceled over 600 flights while it continued to deal with the issue.\n\nRead on below for all of the details about this massive global problem and what is being done to fix it.\n\nFrom our sponsor\n\nAdvertiser Content From",
      "# [CrowdStrike Falcon Outage Exploited for Social Engineering](https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/blog/crowdstrike-falcon-outage-exploited-for-social-engineering)\nBy: The Center for Internet Security® (CIS®) Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) team at the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center® (MS-ISAC®)\n\nPublished July 26, 2024\n\nA widespread IT outage stemming from a defect found in a single CrowdStrike content update began at around 1:00 a.m. ET on July 19, 2024. The outage affected a significant number of Windows hosts globally, including direct impacts to U.S. State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial (SLTT) government entities.[1] In an official statement, CrowdStrike advised they had isolated the issue and deployed a fix.[2]\n\nWhile SLTTs continue to work to maintain critical operations and restore access to Windows-hosted systems running CrowdStrike Falcon sensors, the CIS CTI team has observed cyber threat actors (CTAs) exploiting the situation to tailor phishing lures, typosquatted1 domains, and a malicious archive ZIP file posing as CrowdStrike support and legitimate CrowdStrike infrastructure.3 The CIS CTI team will continue to monitor related threat context and actively disseminate observed context and indicators of compromise (IOCs) through the MS-ISAC indicator sharing program and the Malicious Domain Blocking and Reporting (MDBR) service.4\n\nIn this blog post, the CIS CTI team will detail the threat activity it observed in the first few days following the CrowdStrike Falcon outage.\n\nThe Impact of the CrowdStrike Falcon Outage on SLTTs\n\nThe MS-ISAC initially observed significant disruptions to SLTT members’ systems, and it expects some organizations to continue to experience disruptions while administrators work to effectively deploy CrowdStrike’s fix.2 Reporting indicates there were significant disruptions to airlines, railways, healthcare, and financial institutions. Reports also noted that a few 911 centers relied on backup systems to receive emergency calls, not to mention additional reported impacts to other SLTT subsectors.5\n\nThis incident highlights the potential scale of disruption to SLTTs and critical infrastructure when their systems partially depend on a single vendor. CTAs are almost certain to further recognize these dependencies and leverage that insight to inform future cyber attacks.\n\nCTAs' Attempts to Abuse the CrowdStrike Incident\n\nThe CIS CTI team identified CTAs standing up infrastructure, such as recently created domains imitating CrowdStrike. Those domains are likely designed for social engineering to take advantage of the urgency and uncertainty of the situation. Generally, they follow a common theme of posing as authorized CrowdStrike infrastructure and support.\n\nAdditionally, CrowdStrike Intelligence released a report on July 20, 2024, detailing that they had observed CTAs delivering a malicious ZIP archive containing HijackLoader posing as a legitimate hot fix file.6 The CIS CTI team assesses that IOCs at the end of this report are likely not associated with CrowdStrike and could be used for malicious purposes.\n\nIn the past, the CTI team has observed CTAs leveraging chaotic situations and a heightened sense of urgency to socially engineer unsuspecting users into visiting malicious websites and responding to phishing emails that mimic legitimate entities.7, 8\n\nImpacted Sectors\n\nDuring the initial disruption, the CrowdStrike content update caused interruptions to several SLTT subsectors and other sectors posing downstream impacts to SLTTs. Some examples are listed below:\n\nGovernment administrative functions9\n\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles in several locations10, 11, 12\n\nThe Social Security Administration13\n\nReports indicate “some computers” at the Department of Justice (DOJ) were impacted14\n\nMass transit systems\n\nA major metro rail system suffered disruptions but has since recovered15\n\nHospitals/Healthcare16, 17\n\nAt least 11 health systems reported that the disruption impacted their ability to administer care\n\nSome of these disruptions resulted in canceled surgeries or diverted ambulances\n\nAir travel18, 19\n\nAccording to Flightaware, as of July 19, 2024, at 12:56 p.m. ET:\n\nTotal delays: 31,307\n\nTotal delays within, into, or out of the United States: 6,169\n\nTotal cancellations: 3,566\n\nTotal cancellations within, into, or out of the United States: 2,219\n\nFinancial Services20\n\nPayment systems21, 22\n\nPharmacies23\n\nResulting in the inability to dispense medication\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nThe following IOCs include likely malicious domains CIS CTI analysts identified that pose as legitimate CrowdStrike infrastructure.\n\nLikely Typosquatted CrowdStrike

      "# [SEC Reporting Implications for Publicly Traded Companies Impacted by CrowdStrike Defective Software Update](https://www.cooley.com/news/insight/2024/2024-07-22-sec-reporting-implications-for-publicly-traded-companies-impacted-by-crowdstrike-defective-software-update)\nThere are a number of US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting implications arising from the server-related outages caused by CrowdStrike’s defective software update on July 19, 2024, and their impacts on public companies, particularly in light of the SEC’s new cybersecurity disclosure rules. While the situation on the ground – as well as answers to these questions – is still very much evolving, public companies impacted by the CrowdStrike update should consider doing the following:\n\nEnsure compliance with applicable policies and perform assessments to determine whether any impact from the CrowdStrike update is “material,” and whether any reporting is necessary or advisable.\n\nPerform risk assessments and gap analyses to determine whether there are any shortcomings in systems and systems-related matters, including use of third parties and relevant oversight, monitoring, disaster recovery, and other practices.\n\nUpdate risk factors and other disclosures, including regarding systems downtime and/or reliance on third parties to operate critical business systems.\n\nDetermine if the CrowdStrike update has had or is expected to have a material impact on the company, then consider if it should be discussed in the management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) section of SEC filings, including as a known trend for future periods.\n\nBe mindful of Regulation FD when communicating with analysts and investors regarding the impact of the CrowdStrike update on the company.\n\nEvaluate whether the CrowdStrike update has implications for the company’s internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures.\n\nForm 8-K and implications of CrowdStrike update\n\nAn immediate question in the context of real-time reporting on current reports on Form 8-K is whether the CrowdStrike-related server outages and other impacts on information and information systems of public companies could constitute “cybersecurity incidents” for purposes of Item 1.05 of Form 8-K.\n\nWith most third-party software programs deployed on company systems, public companies around the globe generally authorize providers to push periodic software updates to the companies’ internal systems. Indeed, the deployment of such updates and security patches is often critical for companies to maintain an appropriate cybersecurity posture. However, the recent CrowdStrike update caused global, widespread and, in some cases, systemic failures to computers and networks of CrowdStrike’s customers running certain Microsoft operating systems.\n\nWhile CrowdStrike has stated that its defective code was not due to malicious activity, it is important to note the breadth of the SEC’s definition of a reportable “cybersecurity incident” for purposes of Item 1.05 of Form 8-K in the adopting release for the final rule: “[A]n unauthorized occurrence, or a series of related unauthorized occurrences, on or conducted through a registrant’s information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrant’s information systems or any information residing therein.”1\n\nThis definition is easier to apply to malicious cyber occurrences that cause operational impacts such as ransomware or distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that jeopardize the availability of information systems or information. But it is more difficult to apply to operational impacts arising from faulty coding or technology outages, which may be day-to-day events for thousands of companies.\n\nIn fact, a related issue was raised during the comment period for the SEC’s proposed cyber rule, and the SEC provided its views in the adopting release, stating that “[o]ne commenter sought clarification of whether the definition encompasses accidental incidents, such as chance technology outages, that do not involve a malicious actor, while another commenter advocated broadening the definition to any incident materially disrupting operations, regardless of what precipitated it”2 (emphasis added).\n\nIn addition, the SEC said in the adopting release that it was “retaining ‘unauthorized’ in the incident definition as proposed. In general, we believe that an accidental occurrence is an unauthorized occurrence. Therefore, we note that an accidental occurrence may be a cybersecurity incident under our definition, even if there is no confirmed malicious activity. For example, if a company’s customer data are accidentally exposed, allowing unauthorized access to such data, the data breach would constitute a ‘cybersecurity incident’ that would necessitate a materiality analysis to determine whether disclosure under Item 1.05 of Form 8-K is required”3 (emphasis added).\n\nWhile allowing for accidental occurrences to potentially constitute cybersecurity incidents, the SEC’s specific example relates to unauthorized access to data arising from an accidental occurrence, not a chance technology outage. This example is relatively noncontroversial, as many data breach lawyers have long considered inadvertent data disclosures to be data breaches where the data ends up in the hands of an unauthorized person. However, it does not expressly address whether the additional element of unauthorized access to data is required for an accidental occurrence to constitute an unauthorized occurrence.\n\nIn our view, categorically construing the CrowdStrike update (or similar events) as an unauthorized occurrence would expand the definition of “cybersecurity incident” to potentially capture common software outages and disruptions that are simply baked into the use of software. It is important to note that the CrowdStrike update was authorized by the thousands of organizations that agreed to (and want to) receive automatic software updates from software companies such as CrowdStrike. Requiring real-time reporting on Form 8-K for material impacts of coding errors or software outages that occur in the ordinary course of business would not seem to further the SEC’s objective of reducing mispricing of securities in the market in connection with material cybersecurity incidents and could have the opposite effect as investors may overreact to a disclosed accidental outage.\n\nIn addition, capturing accidental outages from authorized activity in the definition of “cybersecurity incident” would likely result in a significant increase in the number of Item 1.05 8-K disclosures, which would potentially obfuscate the reporting of material cybersecurity incidents truly important to investors and further frustrate the objectives of the new rules. Furthermore, systems outages like those experienced by companies following the CrowdStrike update are only one of many examples of operational disturbances that companies may experience, and there are potentially equally or more significant operational issues that a company might face (e.g., impacts from weather; natural disasters; labor, supplier, manufacturer, customer or lender issues; geopolitical, regulatory or financial markets issues) that generally may not trigger a required Form 8-K.\n\nEven so, the issue is unsettled, and it is important to understand that the SEC has taken a broad interpretation of the federal securities laws with respect to cybersecurity compliance and disclosure matters. Moreover, plaintiffs’ firms may seek to pursue actions based on a more expansive interpretation of the rules. As discussed below, public companies should bear in mind that the Form 8-K cybersecurity incident reporting requirements are not the only potential reporting considerations in the wake of the CrowdStrike update. Therefore, if a public company experienced impacts from the CrowdStrike update, it should be undertaking a materiality assessment of those impacts to determine if any reporting outside the context of Item 1.05 of Form 8-K is necessary or advisable.\n\nOther SEC reporting considerations and takeaways\n\nThe North Star for many of the SEC’s disclosure and reporting obligations is materiality: where there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider information about an occurrence important in making an investment decision, or if information about the occurrence would have significantly altered the “total mix” of information made available. Regardless of whether the CrowdStrike update constitutes a “cybersecurity incident” under the SEC’s cybersecurity rules, public companies should consider whether the impacts from the CrowdStrike update might be material, qualitatively and/or quantitatively. If so, they should analyze applicable reporting provisions, including giving consideration to potentially providing voluntary disclosure related to the impact of the CrowdStrike update on the company’s operations via Item 8.01 of Form 8-K4, in addition to considering updating risk factors to address systems downtime and/or reliance on third parties to operate critical business systems to specifically refer to the CrowdStrike update. If the CrowdStrike update has had or is expected to have material impacts on the company reflected in current and/or future periods, then disclosure should be included in the MD&A, including as a known trend. These considerations should be kept in mind not only for periodic reports but also for registration statements, securities offering materials and other disclosures.\n\nCompanies also should be mindful of Regulation FD when communicating with analysts and investors regarding the impact of the CrowdStrike update on their business. Confirming that there was or was not a material impact of an occurrence in one-off communications with analysts/investors could be deemed to be a selective disclosure of material nonpublic information in certain circumstances. As a result, unless a company is prepared to make a statement in a Regulation FD-compliant manner, the best practice would be to simply respond to such inquiries with a statement that the company is aware of its obligations under securities laws.\n\nFinally, based on the issues surrounding the CrowdStrike update (and inevitably similar ones to come), companies should continue maturing their incident response and escalation processes to enable prompt, reasonable and defensible materiality analysis, in addition to refining their corresponding controls and procedures. The CrowdStrike update reinforces how critical it is for companies to develop and operationalize processes applicable to technology issues that may arise not just from malicious attacks, but also from human error and coding failures or other disruptions. Companies should ensure that they are complying with any applicable policies, procedures and plans, including any escalation or “reporting up” procedures.\n\nCompanies also should continue to evaluate their systems, policies and practices in response to the CrowdStrike update (and other events) to identify risks and any gaps, including with respect to internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures, and take responsive measures by creating and refining policies, procedures, practices, and plans to ensure that impacts to their organization that may arise from cybersecurity threats, system downtime or outages, and other IT issues are appropriately addressed.\n\nPlease contact your Cooley lawyer or one of the lawyers listed below as you and your team work through these evolving considerations.\n\nCooley special counsel Luci Altman also contributed to this alert.\n\nNotes",

      "# [CrowdStrike technology outage causing global disruption across industries, including impacts on hospitals and health systems on 2024-07-19](https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2024-07-19-crowdstrike-technology-outage-causing-global-disruption-across-industries-including-impacts-hospitals)\nA non-malicious global technology outage that began in the early morning of July 19 is continuing to affect many industries and is having varying effects on hospitals and health systems across the country. The outage was caused by a faulty software update issued by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which is widely used by businesses and government agencies that run on Microsoft computers.\n\n“CrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,” the organization posted on its website early today. “Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted. This is not a security incident or cyberattack. The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed. We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website. We further recommend organizations ensure they’re communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels.” CrowdStrike’s webpage includes more information about the issue and workaround steps organizations can take. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency also posted an alert on the incident.\n\nIn a statement shared with media this afternoon, AHA National Advisor for Cybersecurity and Risk John Riggi said, “The AHA is in close communication with the hospital field and the federal government about the non-malicious global technology outage that occurred early this morning. While we continue to monitor the situation closely, we are hearing from hospitals and health systems that the impact varies widely. Some have experienced little to no impact while others are dealing directly with some disruptions to medical technology, communications and third-party service providers. These disruptions are resulting in some clinical procedure delays, diversions or cancellations. Impact is also being felt indirectly as a result of local emergency call centers being down. Impacted hospitals are working hard to implement manual restoration of systems and the CrowdStrike patch. Affected hospitals have also implemented downtime procedures to ensure that disruptions to patient care are minimized or avoided to the extent possible.”\n\nAHA members received a Cybersecurity Advisory with more details.",
      "# [CrowdStrike by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2016-06-08](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrowdStrike)\nAmerican cybersecurity technology company\n\nThis article is about the company. For the widespread IT system outage in July 2024, see 2024 CrowdStrike-related IT outages.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is an American cybersecurity technology company based in Austin, Texas. It provides endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services.\n\nThe company has been involved in investigations of several high-profile cyberattacks, including the 2014 Sony Pictures hack, the 2015–16 cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and the 2016 email leak involving the DNC.[3][4] On July 19, 2024, it issued a faulty update to its security software that caused global computer outages that disrupted air travel, banking, broadcasting, and other services.[5][6][7]\n\nDescription\n\n[edit]\n\nCrowdStrike is an American cybersecurity technology company based in Austin, Texas. It provides endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services.[8] Until July 2024 it was \"best known for deploying immediate updates upon detecting threats, distributing as many as 10–12 per day.\"[9] Since then it has been offering phased or staggered update rollout.[9]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFounding: 2011–2019\n\n[edit]\n\nCrowdStrike was co-founded in 2011 by George Kurtz (CEO), Dmitri Alperovitch (former CTO), and Gregg Marston (CFO, retired).[10][11][12][13] The following year, they hired Shawn Henry, a former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) official, to lead the subsidiary CrowdStrike Services, Inc., which offered security and response services.[14][15] The company launched CrowdStrike Falcon, an antivirus package, as its first product in June 2013.[16][17]\n\nIn May 2014, CrowdStrike's reports helped the United States Department of Justice to charge five Chinese military hackers with economic cyber espionage against U.S. corporations.[18] CrowdStrike also uncovered the activities of Energetic Bear, a group connected to Russia's Federal Security Service that conducted intelligence operations against global targets, primarily in the energy sector.[19]\n\nAfter the Sony Pictures hack, CrowdStrike uncovered evidence implicating the government of North Korea and demonstrated how the attack was carried out.[20] In 2014, CrowdStrike helped identify members of Putter Panda, the state-sponsored Chinese group of hackers also known as PLA Unit 61486.[21][22]\n\nIn May 2015, the company released information about VENOM, a critical flaw in an open-source hypervisor called Quick Emulator (QEMU) that allowed attackers to access sensitive personal information.[23][24] In October 2015, CrowdStrike announced that it had identified Chinese hackers attacking technology and pharmaceutical companies around the time that U.S. President Barack Obama and China's leader Xi Jinping publicly agreed not to conduct economic espionage against each other. The alleged hacking would have been in violation of that agreement.[25]\n\nIn July 2015, Google invested in the company's Series C funding round, which was followed by Series D and Series E, raising a total of $480 million as of May 2019.[26][27][28]\n\nIn 2017, the company reached a valuation of more than $1 billion with an estimated annual revenue of $100 million.[29] In June 2018, the company said it was valued at more than $3 billion.[27] Investors include Telstra, March Capital Partners, Rackspace, Accel Partners and Warburg Pincus.[30][31]\n\nIn June 2019, the company made an initial public offering on the Nasdaq.[32][33]\n\nAcquisitions: 2020–2024\n\n[edit]\n\nIn September 2020, CrowdStrike acquired zero trust and conditional access technology provider Preempt Security for $96 million.[34] In February 2021, the company acquired Danish log management platform Humio for $400 million with plans to integrate Humio's log aggregation into CrowdStrike's XDR offering.[35] Later that November, CrowdStrike acquired SecureCircle, a SaaS-based cybersecurity service that extends zero trust endpoint security to include data.[36] In December 2021, the company moved its headquarters location from Sunnyvale, California, to Austin, Texas.[37] In 2023, CrowdStrike introduced CrowdStream service in collaboration with Cribl.io.[38] CrowdStrike has also focused on working with the U.S. government and selling its services to government agencies.[39] CrowdStrike joined the S&P 500 index in June 2024.[40] In 2023, CrowdStrike acquired Israeli cybersecurity startup Bionic.ai.[41] In 2024, CrowdStrike acquired Israeli cloud security startups Flow Security for $200 million[42] and Adaptive Shield for $300 million.[43]\n\nIncident: 2024\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2024 CrowdStrike-related IT outages\n\nOn 19 July 2024, CrowdStrike released a software configuration file update to the Falcon endpoint detection and response agent. Flaws in the update caused blue screens of death on Microsoft Windows machines, disrupting millions of Windows computers worldwide.[44][45] Affected machines were forced into a bootloop, making them unusable. This was caused by an update to a configuration file, Channel File 291, which CrowdStrike says triggered a logic error and caused the operating system to crash.[46] The downtime caused a widespread global impact, grounding commercial airline flights, temporarily taking Sky News and other broadcasters offline, and disrupting banking and healthcare services as well as 911 emergency call centers.[7][47]\n\nBy the end of the day, CrowdStrike shares closed trading at a price of $304.96, down $38.09 or 11.10%.[48]\n\nAlthough CrowdStrike issued a patch to fix the error, computers stuck in a bootloop were unable to connect to the Internet to download the patch before Falcon would be loaded and crash the device again. The recommended solution from CrowdStrike was to boot into safe mode or Windows Recovery Mode and manually delete Channel File 291.[49] This requires local administrator access and if the device was encrypted by BitLocker, also required a recovery key.[50] Microsoft reported that some customers were able to remediate the issue solely by rebooting impacted devices up to 15 times.[51] On 22 July 2024, CrowdStrike shares closed the trading day at a price of $263.91, with a loss of $41.05 or 13.46%.[52] On 24 July 2024, CrowdStrike reportedly contacted affected channel partners with apology emails containing Uber Eats gift cards worth $10.[53][54][55] The CrowdStrike incident cost Fortune 500 companies $5.4 billion.[9]\n\nLobbying\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2024, CrowdStrike spent more than $360,000 on federal lobbying in the first half of 2024, according to OpenSecrets and $620,000 during 2023.[9]\n\nEarnings\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2024, total revenue was $3.06 billion, a 36% increase.[9]\n\nRussian hacking investigations\n\n[edit]\n\nCrowdStrike helped investigate the Democratic National Committee cyberattacks and a connection to Russian intelligence services.[56] On 20 March 2017, James Comey testified before congress stating, \"CrowdStrike, Mandiant, and ThreatConnect review[ed] the evidence of the hack and conclude[d] with high certainty that it was the work of APT 28 and APT 29 who are known to be Russian intelligence services.\"[57] Comey previously testified in January 2017 that a request for FBI forensics investigators to access the DNC servers was denied, saying \"Ultimately what was agreed to is the private company [CrowdStrike] would share with us what they saw.\"[58]\n\nIn December 2016, CrowdStrike released a report stating that Russian government-affiliated group Fancy Bear had hacked a Ukrainian artillery app.[59] They concluded that Russia had used the hack to cause large losses to Ukrainian artillery units. The app (called ArtOS) is installed on tablet PCs and used for fire-control.[60] CrowdStrike also found a hacked variation of POPR-D30 being distributed on Ukrainian military forums that utilized an X-Agent implant.[61]\n\nThe International Institute for Strategic Studies rejected CrowdStrike's assessment that claimed hacking caused losses to Ukrainian artillery units, saying that their data on Ukrainian D30 howitzer losses was misused in CrowdStrike's report. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense also rejected the CrowdStrike report, stating that actual artillery losses were much smaller than what was reported by CrowdStrike and were not associated with Russian hacking.[62] Prior to this, CrowdStrike had published a report claiming that malware used in Ukraine and against the Democratic National Committee (DNC) appeared to be unique and identical, further evidence for a Russian origin of the DNC attack.[63]\n\nCybersecurity firm SecureWorks discovered a list of email addresses targeted by Fancy Bear in phishing attacks. The list included the email address of Yaroslav Sherstyuk, the developer of ArtOS.[64] Additional Associated Press research supports CrowdStrike's conclusions about Fancy Bear.[65] Radio Free Europe notes that the AP report \"lends some credence to the original CrowdStrike report, showing that the app had, in fact, been targeted.\"[66]\n\nIn the Trump–Ukraine scandal, Donald Trump, then the president of the United States, held a 25 July 2019, phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, in which Trump asked Zelensky to look into a conspiracy theory that was being promoted on far-right websites such as Breitbart News and Russian state media outlets such as Russia Today and Sputnik.[67] The theory held that namely, that the Ukrainian government used CrowdStrike to hack into the Democratic National Committee's servers in 2016 and frame Russia for the crime to undermine Trump in the 2016 presidential election.[68][69] The conspiracy theory has been repeatedly debunked.[70][71][72]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nOperating systems\n\nChinese intelligence activity abroad\n\nChinese intelligence operations in the United States\n\nTimeline of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections\n\nTimeline of investigations into Donald Trump and Russia (January–June 2017)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",
      "# [CrowdStrike avoids customer exodus after triggering global IT outage by Matt Kapko on 2024-11-27](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/crowdstrike-retains-customers/734203/)\nCrowdStrike held on to its customers, avoiding significant customer losses in the wake of its defective Falcon software update that caused a global IT network outage over the summer, the cybersecurity vendor said Tuesday during an earnings call.\n\n“Falcon customers are staying with CrowdStrike as their trusted cybersecurity platform of choice,” CEO George Kurtz said Tuesday during the earnings call for the company’s Q3 fiscal 2025, which ended Oct. 31. “Q3 gross retention was over 97%, down less than half a percentage point.”\n\nQ3 marked the first full quarter following the July 19 incident, which put CrowdStrike’s reputation on the line. The aftermath of one of the largest global IT outages in history prompted a quick apology and testimony on Capitol Hill. The company also promised to make a series of internal changes designed to prevent similar errors and earn back trust.\n\n“Although true that we are a little further from the sun, we’re still kind of fighting through the incident,” CFO Burt Podbere said during the earnings call.\n\nCrowdStrike’s revenue increased almost 29% year over year to $1 billion, yet the company swung to a net loss of $16.8 million. The loss was “primarily due to $33.9 million in expenses related to the July 19 incident,” Podbere said.\n\nThe company’s “customer commitment packages,” discounts it’s offering some customers through the second half of this year, are generating longer-term deals and increased adoption of CrowdStrike services, the company said.\n\nKurtz pointed to some churn in the managed security services space, but said that’s common and not indicative of the broader customer retention performance.\n\n“I'm encouraged by the conversation that I'm having with our largest customers, and a reflection on the fact that they realize that we have the best tech in the industry, and the ability to stop breaches and drive down overall operational costs from a platform perspective,” Kurtz said.",
      "# [Don't Fall for It: Hackers Pounce on CrowdStrike Outage With Phishing Emails by Michael Kan on 2024-07-19](https://www.pcmag.com/news/dont-fall-for-it-hackers-pounce-on-crowdstrike-outage-with-phishing-emails)\nUPDATE: CrowdStrike has also spotted cybercriminals using the outage as bait to hack prospective targets. This includes \"impersonating CrowdStrike staff in phone calls,\" and \"posing as independent researchers, claiming to have evidence the technical issue is linked to a cyberattack.\"\n\nThe company's blog post lists several malicious domains that the hackers have been using.\n\n(Credit: CrowdStrike)\n\nOriginal story:\n\nWatch out for emails that claim to come from CrowdStrike. Hackers have been quick to exploit Friday’s massive IT outage by posing as the cybersecurity company behind the disruption.\n\nThe US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and UK National Cyber Security Centre issued alerts warning about phishing emails attempting to capitalize on the chaos.\n\n\"An increase in phishing referencing this outage has already been observed, as opportunistic malicious actors seek to take advantage of the situation. This may be aimed at both organizations and individuals,\" the UK agency said.\n\nThe US-based SANS Technology Institute, which promotes cybersecurity, issued a similar warning. “Some reports we have seen indicate that there may be phishing emails circulating claiming to come from ‘Crowdstrike Support’ or ‘Crowdstrike Security,’” wrote Johannes Ullrich, the dean of research at the institute.\n\n“I do not have any samples at this point, but attackers are likely leveraging the heavy media attention. Please be careful with any ‘patches’ that may be delivered this way,” he added. “One domain possibly associated with these phishing attacks is: crowdfalcon-immed-update [.] com.”\n\nThe outage represents a ripe opportunity for cybercriminals since it's affecting numerous companies, including airlines. In total, CrowdStrike has about 29,000 enterprise customers — many of which are likely scrambling to resolve Friday’s disruption\n\nCrowdStrike has issued an advisory on how companies and individual users can restore affected Windows systems, which has been sourced to a faulty software update. Nevertheless, phishing emails dressed up to look like the cybersecurity vendor could trick customers desperate for help.\n\nThe Texas Department of Information Resources added that's it's been \"receiving reports that bad actors are impersonating CrowdStrike employees to gain access credentials.\"\n\nSome cybersecurity researchers have also spotted someone registering several internet domains using the names such as “crowdstrikebluescreen[.]com,” and “crowdstrike0day[.]com” — a sign that hackers are preparing to create numerous scam websites to exploit the outage."
