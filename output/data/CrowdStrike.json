  "summary_markdown": "# About CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is a prominent cybersecurity technology company founded in 2011 and headquartered in Austin, Texas. The company specializes in cloud-delivered protection for endpoints, cloud workloads, identity, and data. Its flagship product, the CrowdStrike Falcon platform, offers a comprehensive suite of cybersecurity solutions, including endpoint protection, threat intelligence, and security orchestration [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRWD/).\n\nAs of January 2024, CrowdStrike employs approximately 9,219 full-time employees and has a market capitalization of around $71.636 billion [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRWD/). The company operates primarily in the B2B sector, serving a wide range of industries, including healthcare, airlines, and banking. CrowdStrike generates revenue through subscriptions to its Falcon platform and related services, reporting a trailing twelve-month revenue of approximately $3.52 billion with a profit margin of 4.84% [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRWD/).\n\nCrowdStrike's products are distributed through direct sales and partnerships, with notable collaborations with companies like ExtraHop, ServiceNow, and Axiomatics to enhance its cybersecurity solutions [(CrowdStrike Website)](https://marketplace.crowdstrike.com/). The company has shown significant growth over time, with a five-year stock return of 370.29%, outperforming the S&P 500 [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRWD/).\n\nThird parties often describe CrowdStrike as a leader in the cybersecurity industry, recognizing its innovative approach and robust product offerings. However, recent operational challenges have raised concerns about its software testing protocols and operational resilience [(ABC News, 2024)](https://abcnews.go.com/US/american-airlines-issues-global-ground-stop-flights/story?id=112092372).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nGeorge Kurtz is the CEO of CrowdStrike. He has publicly addressed recent operational challenges, emphasizing the company's commitment to transparency and customer support. Kurtz has pledged to implement more rigorous testing and validation processes to prevent future incidents [(Falcon Content Update, 2024)](https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/).\n\n# News\n\n## Major Outage Incident\n\nOn July 19, 2024, CrowdStrike experienced a significant operational disruption due to a faulty software update, affecting approximately 8.5 million Windows devices globally. This incident was not a result of a cyberattack but rather a defect in a content update for the Falcon platform, leading to widespread system crashes [(ABC News, 2024)](https://abcnews.go.com/US/american-airlines-issues-global-ground-stop-flights/story?id=112092372). The update was live for only 78 minutes before being reverted, but the damage was extensive, impacting various sectors including healthcare, airlines, and banking [(Cybersecurity Dive, 2024)](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/crowdstrike-flawed-update-78-minutes/722070/).\n\n### Financial Impact\n\nThe outage had severe financial repercussions, particularly in the healthcare sector, which is estimated to have incurred losses of approximately $1.94 billion. Airlines, including Delta, reported losses of around $500 million due to operational disruptions [(Healthcare Innovation Group, 2024)](https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/cybersecurity/news/55132837/194b-in-expected-healthcare-losses-due-to-crowdstrike-disruption) [(BBC, 2024)](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy08ljxndr4o). Following the incident, CrowdStrike's stock price fell nearly 15% in early trading, reflecting investor concerns over the company's operational reliability [(CBS News, 2024)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/microsoft-internet-outages-reported-worldwide/).\n\n### Legal Challenges\n\nIn the aftermath of the outage, CrowdStrike is facing a class-action lawsuit from shareholders who allege that the company made \"false and misleading\" statements regarding its software testing processes. The lawsuit claims that the faulty update led to a significant drop in share value, amounting to a loss of $25 billion in market capitalization [(BBC, 2024)](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy08ljxndr4o).\n\n## Product Innovations\n\nDuring the recent Fal.Con 2024 event, CrowdStrike unveiled several enhancements to its Falcon platform, including:\n- **Detection Posture Management**: This feature maps active detection rules to MITRE ATT&CK techniques, providing security teams with a comprehensive view of their detection coverage [(Fal.Con News Center, 2024)](https://www.crowdstrike.com/events/fal-con/las-vegas/news/).\n- **Enhanced Workflow Automation**: The Falcon Fusion SOAR has been upgraded to include over 300 prebuilt actions, significantly improving response times and operational efficiency [(Fal.Con News Center, 2024)](https://www.crowdstrike.com/events/fal-con/las-vegas/news/).\n- **AI Innovations**: New AI-driven capabilities, such as Charlotte AI for detection triaging and AI-generated parsers for data onboarding, were introduced to streamline operations and enhance threat detection [(Fal.Con News Center, 2024)](https://www.crowdstrike.com/events/fal-con/las-vegas/news/).\n\n# Additional Reading\n\n- [CrowdStrike Community](https://community.crowdstrike.com/private/login)\n- [Partner Apps and Integrations](https://marketplace.crowdstrike.com/)\n- [OpenSource @ CrowdStrike](https://opensource.crowdstrike.com/)\n- [Resources for Our Suppliers](https://www.crowdstrike.com/suppliers/)\n- [Log4Shell Updates](https://www.crowdstrike.com/log4j2/)\n- [CrowdStrike Careers](https://www.crowdstrike.com/careers/)\n- [Customer Login](https://www.crowdstrike.com/login/)\n- [Threat Landscape](https://www.crowdstrike.com/adversaries/)\n- [CrowdStrike News](https://www.crowdstrike.com/news/)\n- [CrowdStrike Resources](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/)\n- [CrowdStrike Demos](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/demos/)\n- [CrowdStrike Videos](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/videos/)\n- [CrowdExchange Community](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/crowdexchange/)\n- [Privacy Notice](https://www.crowdstrike.com/privacy-notice/)\n- [CrowdStrike Spanish Site](https://www.crowdstrike.com/es-latam/)\n\nCrowdStrike is currently navigating a critical period marked by a significant operational setback due to a software update failure. While the company has demonstrated strong growth and innovation in its product offerings, the recent outage raises questions about its operational resilience and software testing protocols. Prospective candidates and investors should closely monitor CrowdStrike's response to the incident, its legal challenges, and its ongoing commitment to enhancing its cybersecurity solutions.",

Note: For identity protection functionality, you must install the sensor on your domain controllers, which must be running a 64-bit server OS.\n\n64-bit Server OSes:\n\nServer 2022\n\nServer Core 2022\n\nServer 2019\n\nServer Core 2019\n\nServer 2016\n\nServer Core 2016\n\nServer 2012 R2\n\nStorage Server 2012 R2\n\nServer 2012\n\nServer 2008 R2 SP1\n\nMicrosoft ARM64:\n\nWindows 11\n\nWindows 10\n\nDesktop OSes:\n\nWindows 11 22H2\n\nWindows 11 21H2\n\nWindows 10 22H2\n\nWindows 10 21H2\n\nWindows 10 1809\n\nWindows 10 1607\n\nWindows 10 1507\n\nWindows 7 SP1\n\nWindows 7 Embedded POS Ready\n\nWe support x86_64, Graviton 64, and s390x zLinux versions of these Linux server OSes:\n\nx86_64\n\nAlma Linux\n\n9.3: sensor version 7.07.16203 and later\n\n9.2: sensor version 7.03.15805 and later\n\n9.1: sensor version 7.02.15705 and later\n\n9.0: sensor version 6.41.13804 and later\n\n8.9: sensor version 7.07.16203 and later\n\n8.8: sensor version 6.57.15402 and later\n\n8.7: sensor version 6.48.14504 and later\n\n8.6: sensor version 6.41.13803 and later\n\n8.5: sensor version 6.33.13003 and later\n\n8.4: sensor version 6.29.12606 and later\n\nAmazon Linux 2\n\nAmazon Linux 2023: sensor version 7.10.16303 and later\n\nAmazon Linux AMI\n\n2018.03\n\n2017.09\n\nCentOS\n\n8.5: sensor version 6.33.13003 and later\n\n8.4: sensor version 6.24.12104 and later\n\n8.3\n\n8.2: sensor version 5.34.9917 and later\n\n8.1: sensor version 5.27.9101 and later\n\n8.0\n\n7.9: sensor version 5.43.10803 and later\n\n7.8: sensor version 5.30.9510 and later\n\n7.4 - 7.7\n\n6.7 - 6.10\n\nDebian\n\n12: sensor version 7.10.16303 and later\n\n11: sensor version 6.34.13108 and later\n\n10: sensor version 6.20.11711 and later\n\n9.1-9.4: sensor version 5.33.9804 and later\n\nElRepo\n\nElRepo 7.x (5.4 kernel)\n\nElRepo 8.x (5.4 kernel)\n\nâ¨\n\nOracle Linux\n\nOracle Linux 9 - UEK 7: sensor version 6.50.14712\n\nOracle Linux 8 - UEK 6\n\nOracle Linux 7 - UEK 6: sensor version 6.19.11610 and later\n\nOracle Linux 7 - UEK 3, 4, 5\n\nOracle Linux 6 - UEK 3, 4\n\nRed Hat Compatible Kernels (supported RHCK kernels are the same as for RHEL)\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) Note: For DaemonSet deployment only.\n\n4.15: sensor version 7.13.16604 and later\n\n4.14: sensor version 7.13.16604 and later\n\n4.13: sensor version 7.04.15907 and later\n\n4.12: sensor version 6.54.15110 and later\n\n4.11: sensor version 6.46.14306 and later\n\n4.10: sensor version 6.46.14306 and later\n\n4.9: sensor version 6.39.13601 and later\n\n4.8: sensor version 6.39.13601 and later\n\n4.7: sensor version 6.39.13601 and later\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)\n\n9.3: sensor version 7.07.16203 and later\n\n9.2: sensor version 7.03.15805 and later\n\n9.1: sensor version 7.02.15705 and later\n\n9.0: sensor version 6.41.13804 and later\n\n8.9: sensor version 7.07.16203 and later\n\n8.8: sensor version 6.57.15402 and later\n\n8.7: sensor version 6.48.14504 and later\n\n8.6: sensor version 6.41.13803 and later\n\n8.5: sensor version 6.33.13003 and later\n\n8.4: sensor version 6.24.12104 and later\n\n8.3\n\n8.2: sensor version 5.34.9917 and later\n\n8.1: sensor version 5.27.9101 and later\n\n8.0\n\n7.9: sensor version 5.43.10803 and later\n\n7.8: sensor version 5.30.9510 and later\n\n7.4 - 7.7\n\n6.7 - 6.10\n\nRocky Linux\n\n9.3: sensor version 7.07.16203 and later\n\n9.2: sensor version 7.03.15805 and later\n\n9.1: sensor version 7.02.15705 and later\n\n9.0: sensor version 6.41.13804 and later\n\n8.9: sensor version 7.07.16203 and later\n\n8.8: sensor version 6.57.15402 and later\n\n8.7: sensor version 6.48.14504 and later\n\n8.6: sensor version 6.41.13803 and later\n\n8.5: sensor version 6.33.13003 and later\n\n8.4: sensor version 6.29.12606 and later\n\nSUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES)\n\n15.5 SLES 15 SP5: sensor version 7.04.15907 and later\n\n15 - 15.4.

We have also been able to confirm that the update that caused the CrowdStrike agent issue is no longer being automatically updated. Second, the following steps can be followed to delete the file on the affected instance:  \n  \n1. Create a snapshot of the EBS root volume of the affected instance  \n2. Create a new EBS Volume from the snapshot in the same availability zone  \n3. Launch a new Windows instance in that availability zone using a similar version of Windows  \n4.

We spent 36 hours changing bios to ACHI so we could get into Safemode as Raid doesn’t support safemode and now we cannot change them back without reimaging. \n\nLuckily our SCCM techs were able to create a task sequence to pull the bitlocker pwd from AD and delete the corrupted file, and so with USB keys we can boot into SCCM TS and run the fix in 3 minutes without swapping bios settings. \n\nAt the end of June, 3 weeks ago, Crowdstrike sent a corrupted definition that hung the 100,000 computers and servers at 90% CPU and took multiple 10 Minute reboots to recover. \n\nWe told them then they need to TEST their files before deploying. \n\nObviously the company ignored that and then intentionally didn’t PS1 and PS2 test this update at all. \n\nHow can anyone trust them again?  Once they make a massive error a MONTH ago and do nothing to change the testing process and then proceed to harm patients by taking down Emergency Rooms and Operating Rooms?\n\nAs a sysadmin for 35 years this is the biggest disaster to healthcare I have ever seen.

Adding a monkey wrench to this, our desktops / laptops use a non Microsoft full disk encryption solution. It’s been one hell of a ride so far. I’m part of the desktop endpoint management team and at 1:45am  yesterday before we knew the issue was crowdstrike I woke up to an emergency conference call being asked if my team had deployed any windows updates or something else causing this, I could not immediately access our admin console so I was triple guessing myself thinking we did something by mistake.

We run Crowdstrike provided by our enterprise. Crowdstrike pushed an update on a Friday evening that was incompatible with up-to-date Debian stable. So we patched Debian as usual, everything was fine for a week, and then all of our servers across multiple websites and cloud hosts simultaneously hard crashed and refused to boot.\n\nWhen we connected one of the disks to a new machine and checked the logs, Crowdstrike looked like a culprit, so we manually deleted it, the machine booted, tried reinstalling it and the machine immediately crashes again. OK, let's file a support ticket and get an engineer on the line.\n\nCrowdstrike took a day to respond, and then asked for a bunch more proof (beyond the above) that it was their fault. They acknowledged the bug a day later, and weeks later had a root cause analysis that they didn't cover our scenario (Debian stable running version n-1, I think, which is a supported configuration) in their test matrix. In our own post mortem there was no real ability to prevent the same thing from happening again -- \"we push software to your machines any time we want, whether or not it's urgent, without testing it\" seems to be core to the model, particularly if you're a small IT part of a large enterprise.

Obviously whatever change it was, was likely not meant to land in the root level, and someone from (speculation here) Crowdstrike’s content deployment team probably forgot a trailing slash to the actual intended directory. Which is why a simple file delete will fix it. Has anyone analyzed the actual file yet? The only thing I’ve gathered now is that the file itself is causing memory issues and Windows is freaking out and kernel panicking the OS.\n\nEither way, it’s the fix/solution that’s so absurdly time consuming especially with the need to decrypt these business endpoints in BIOS with a bit locker key before even getting into safe mode to delete said file and then reboot again, and then bit lock again. A very tiresome manual process especially with remote users, with which doing this thousands of times over will take a long time for some businesses. Seems there are some automated ways to do this, but the decryption is not so easy. And if your company has any kind of security policy (which they would) they’re not just going to allow some open source quick fix to enter their network without the highest level of vetting and approval themselves or to create their own which would require a thorough vetting process, and would take a while to get tested and approved. And remember, Microsoft says “just turn it off and on again” because maybe the end point will reach Crowdstrike’s servers on reboot forget that a HUGE amount of these affected machines are probably airgapped or offline, segregated from certain parts of the business’s network(s) for security reasons and can’t be reached like a traditional end client. Either way, I feel for all IT staff out there having to deal with this.\n\n## Comment ID ldyznd7 with +3 score by [(ShamanOty, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldyznd7/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nWhat a wonderful day we had , thank you cloud strike you just stopped our whole production in over 60 factories , im sure no one could breach into our systems today 😁 , that's an insane security level.\n\n## Comment ID ldz15m2 with +3 score by [(verismRIP, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldz15m2/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nPraying for anyone with no immediate access to Bitlocker recovery keys.

I'm lost trying to understand:  When a new version 'n' of the sensor is released, we upgrade a selected batch of machines and do some tests (mostly waiting around :-)) to see that all is well.  Then we upgrade the rest of the fleet by OU. However, 'cause we're scaredy cats, we leave some critical kit on n-1 for longer.  And some really critical kit even on n-2.  (Yeah, there's a risk in not applying patches I know but there are other outage-related risks that we balance; forget that for now)  Our assumption is that n-1, n-2, etc are old, stable releases, and so when fan and shit collided yesterday, we just hopped on the console and did a policy update to revert to n-2 and assumed we'd dodged the bullet.  But of course, that failed... you know what they say about assumptions :-)  So in a long-winded way that leads to my three questions:  Why did the 'content update'  take out not just n but n-whatever sensors equally as effectively?  Are the n-whatever versions not actually stable?  And if the n-whatever versions are not actually stable and are being patched, what's the point of the versioning?

For Windows, it installs as a Boot-Start Driver, so it must start successfully for the OS to boot up.\n\nOne feature of Falcon is to monitor named pipe executions on Windows systems. Named Pipes are a mechanism for interprocess communication in Windows that can be exploited by malicious actors.\n\n**Error**\n\nOn July 19th, Crowdstrike published a sensor configuration update that was installed automatically on millions of systems worldwide.\n\nThe update contained an erroneous file, C-00000291\\*.sys, which is a configuration file also known as a channel file.\n\nWhen the Falcon driver accesses this configuration file, it encounters a logic error and crashes. Ultimately causing the dreaded Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).\n\n**Fix**\n\nFor individual machines:\n\n1. Boot into safe mode / Windows Recovery Environment\n2. Open Terminal in Safe Mode or select it in the Windows Recovery Environment\n3. cd to %WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\drivers\\\\CrowdStrike\n4. Delete files matching regex: C-00000291\\*.sys\n5. Reboot\n\nFor servers:\n\n1. Detach OS disk volume from the impacted server\n2. Create a snapshot/backup just in case\n3. Mount the disk onto a virtual server\n4. Repeat the steps to delete the affected files like the above\n5. Reattach the disk back onto the server.\n\n### Comment ID le2zqwv with +4 score by [(According_Oil_1865, Reddit, 2024-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/le2zqwv/) (in reply to ID le2vh46):\nNull pointer causing crash?

From all companies I know: Every rollout will be stopped immediately if the error rate hits a certain percentage. And if 100% of the clients are offline after the update, this should be also considered as error (but maybe no one thought it could be that bad). \n\nBut even before that. For this big tech company, there should be an entire team/department checking each update goes smoothly. \n\nWild guess #1: Things are not running smoothly within the company.\n\nWild guess #2: Smells a bit like snake oil.\n\n## Comment ID ldws6cz with +2 score by [(LBEB80, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldws6cz/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\n![gif](giphy|zUwHGTclRb7W|downsized)\n\nIm in!\n\n## Comment ID ldws74x with +2 score by [(Honest-FudgeKel, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldws74x/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nGonna be a long weekend for us in Germany 🤦🏾\n\n## Comment ID ldws8sz with +2 score by [(AStrangersDream, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldws8sz/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nA few hours earlier at Crowdstrike [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya2xifdO\\_l0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya2xifdO_l0)\n\n## Comment ID ldws9kf with +2 score by [(rxtc, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldws9kf/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nYes, my whole org :'(\n\n## Comment ID ldws9xv with +2 score by [(bradklyn, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldws9xv/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nYou either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain.\n\n## Comment ID ldwsd1y with +2 score by [(5370616e69617264, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldwsd1y/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nThere are healthcare and emergency services not working right now.

We are an M365 E3 licensed org with the E5 security suite added on for users.  There is a lot of integration with MS across the solution stack, however from a management side we do not have dedicated security people that can stay on top of everything.  Yes, it is working and online, but if something major were to happen we would be looking for resources and support needs very quickly.  This is why a possible managed CS solution has been talked about. \n\nTechnically, we would still have several MS security items in place and Defender would still be online, just taking a backseat if you will to CS that is installed on workstation's and servers.\n\nI wanted to see if there is anyone that currently has a Defender solution in place and then went with CS?  If yes, what was the reason and how has it been?  If no, what was the reason?\n\nI am not sure on what the cost structure of something like this would look like, and it might not be possible, but I am gathering information and wanted to hear what others have done in this situation.\n\nThank you and I welcome any feedback or thoughts you have!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Comment ID ksqk8sc with +27 score by [(OK_SmellYaLater, Reddit, 2024-02-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1b35fbs/crowdstrike_vs_ms_defender/ksqk8sc/) (in reply to ID 1b35fbs):\nWe have run the CrowdStrike Falcon Complete on 4500 hosts for 3.5 years and are very happy with the service. Users and endpoints are a huge risk to the organization, so our selection process didn't include the option for Microsoft Defender only because we prefer a defense in depth approach with multiple layers. While Microsoft can cover all of the bases, they don't really do anything great and we don't like the thought of Microsoft \"grading their own homework\" so to speak. This is why we have added additional layers or outsourced security aspects to other vendors and 3rd parties when possible, like using Avanan for email security and Rapid7 instead of Sentinel etc.  \n\nCrowdStrike Falcon Complete is kick ass. It might be cost prohibitive if you are under 300 licenses, but the cost is absolutely worth it if you can pull it off. In the last 3+ years they have stopped 2 ransomware attacks and remediated other significant infections with very little effort on our side, if any. Their incident response team is great and have been helpful with information and assistance on incidents that weren't related to endpoints/crowdstrike. Support is amazing.

You need check and balance. However, most customers do end up with MS as their IT will buy E5 for other reasons.\n\nWith CS Falcon complete, just note the limitations. They're great at detecting and responding to threats but that's it. If you have a problem with CS software, you call support and not the falcon team.

If you're like us and have a bunch of servers in Azure running Crowdstrike, the past 8 hours have probably SUCKED for you! The only guidance is to boot in safe mode, but how the heck do you do that on an Azure VM??\n\nI wanted to quickly share what worked for us:\n\n1) Make a clone of your OS disk. Snapshot --> create a new disk from it, create a new disk directly with the old disk as source, whatever your preferred workflow is\n\n2) Attach the cloned OS disk to a functional server as a data disk\n\n3) Open disk management (create and format hard disk partitions), find the new disk, right click, \"online\"\n\n4) Check the letters of the disk partitions: both system reserved and windows\n\n5) Navigate to the staged disk's Windows drive, deal with the Crowdstrike files. Either rename the Crowdstrike folder at Windows\\System32\\drivers\\Crowdstrike as Crowdstrike.bak or similar, delete the the file matching “C-00000291*.sys”, per Crowdstrike's instructions, whatever\n\nFrom here, we found that if we replaced the disk on the server, we would get a winload.exe boot manager error instead! Don't dismount your disk, we aren't done yet!\n\n6) Pull up this MS Learn doc: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/windows/error-code-0xc000000e\n\n7) Follow the instructions in the document to run bcdedit repairs on your boot directory. So in our case, that meant the following -- replace F: and H: with the appropriate drive letters.

Login to Azure console --> Go to Virtual Machines --> Select the VM\n2. Upper left on console --> Click : \"Connect\" --> Click --> Connect --> Click \"More ways to Connect\"  --> Click : \"Serial Console\"\n3. Step 3 : Once SAC has loaded, type in 'cmd' and press enter.\n   1. type in 'cmd' command\n   2. type in : ch -si 1\n4. Press any key (space bar). Enter Administrator credentials\n5.

Hovever microsoft updated their KB on [https://azure.status.microsoft/en-gb/status](https://azure.status.microsoft/en-gb/status) Copy of the MS KB below, **The TLDR - do many VM reboots (up to 15!)**\n\n## \n\nWe have been made aware of an issue impacting Virtual Machines running Windows Client and Windows Server, running the CrowdStrike Falcon agent, which may encounter a bug check (BSOD) and get stuck in a restarting state. We approximate impact started around 19:00 UTC on the 18th of July.\n\nAdditional details from CrowdStrike are available here: [Statement on Windows Sensor Update - crowdstrike.com](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-windows-sensor-update/)\n\n**Update as of 10:30 UTC on 19 July 2024:**\n\nWe have received reports of successful recovery from some customers attempting multiple Virtual Machine restart operations on affected Virtual Machines. Customers can attempt to do so as follows:\n\n* Using the Azure Portal - attempting 'Restart' on affected VMs\n* Using the Azure CLI or Azure Shell ([https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com/))\n\n\n\nWe've received feedback from customers that several reboots (as many as 15 have been reported) may be required, but overall feedback is that reboots are an effective troubleshooting step at this stage.\n\n**Additional options for recovery:**\n\nWe recommend customers that are able to, to restore from a backup from before 19:00 UTC on the 18th of July.\n\n* Customers leveraging Azure Backup can follow the following instructions:\n\n[How to restore Azure VM data in Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms)\n\n* Alternatively, customers can attempt to repair the OS disk offline by following these instructions: \n\n[Attach an unmanaged disk to a VM for offline repair](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/windows/unmanaged-disk-offline-repair)\n\n* Disks that are encrypted may need these additional instructions:\n\n[Unlocking an encrypted disk for offline repair](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/windows/unlock-encrypted-disk-offline)\n\nOnce the disk is attached, customers can attempt to delete the following file. \n\nWindows/System/System32/Drivers/CrowdStrike/C00000291\\*.sys\n\nThe disk can then be attached and re-attached to the original VM.\n\nWe can confirm the affected update has been pulled by CrowdStrike. Customers that are continuing to experience issues should reach out to CrowdStrike for additional assistance.\n\nAdditionally, we're continuing to investigate additional mitigation options for customers and will share more information as it becomes known.\n\nThis message was last updated at 11:36 UTC on 19 July 2024\n\n#### Comment ID ldxcsrh with +2 score by [(manvscar, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1e70rdw/psa_repairing_the_crowdstrike_bsod_on_azurehosted/ldxcsrh/) (in reply to ID ldx6srr):\nI noticed that my VM's do actually respond to ping for a couple seconds until they BSOD and restart again.

I understand wanting to be as protected as possible against malware, but not at the expense of your entire digital infrastructure.\n\n#### Comment ID ldxh5l8 with +7 score by [(nightblackdragon, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1e72ovd/has_something_as_catastrophic_as_crowdstrike_ever/ldxh5l8/) (in reply to ID ldxc3ma):\nTo be honest this seems more like RockyLinux issue as it is supposed to be compatible with RHEL.\n\n#### Comment ID ldyezrr with +3 score by [(lkn240, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1e72ovd/has_something_as_catastrophic_as_crowdstrike_ever/ldyezrr/) (in reply to ID ldxc3ma):\nThe irony is Crowdstrike likely caused far more damage with this than every Cyberattack in history combined.\n\n#### Comment ID le0o2t1 with +1 score by [(Kruug, Reddit, 2024-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1e72ovd/has_something_as_catastrophic_as_crowdstrike_ever/le0o2t1/) (in reply to ID ldxc3ma):\nBecause Rocky _is_ RHEL.\n\n#### Comment ID le1k5of with +1 score by [(Sinaaaa, Reddit, 2024-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1e72ovd/has_something_as_catastrophic_as_crowdstrike_ever/le1k5of/) (in reply to ID ldxc3ma):\n> Rocky Linux was RHEL and pushing some incompatible change.\n\nShouldn't it be basically RHEL?

EDR stands for Endpoint Detection & Response, in layman's terms, EDR is an antivirus on steroids. \n\nEDRs can detect malware using behavior analysis which is based on function calls, filesystem events, network connection and more. Additionally, they can also be centrally managed and automated, so that it can automatically block malicious processes, delete malicious files, lock compromised users etc. \n\nHowever, to do that, the agents need to be loaded as a kernel module (this is the case for Windows, Mac and also Linux), which means that if the agent is faulty, then you may get a BSOD or a kernel panic. Which is what happened in this case, CrowdStrike pushed an update which was faulty, resulting in a lot of BSOD for the Windows users (Mac and Linux agents didn't have a problem with the update).\n\nNow, the fun part is that Microsoft uses CrowdStrike as an EDR for their servers, which resulted in this shitstorm.   \n\nThe way I see it, this could easily happen to Linux or Mac too.\n\nAs a sidenote, Microsoft has its own EDR, Defender for Endpoint, which also supports Linux and Mac through Sentinel One, which is another leading EDR, but they chose to use CrowdStrike for Microsoft's Infrastructure.\n\n### Comment ID ldz42mk with +6 score by [(barkappara, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1e72ovd/has_something_as_catastrophic_as_crowdstrike_ever/ldz42mk/) (in reply to ID ldxsb11):\n> Now, the fun part is that Microsoft uses CrowdStrike as an EDR for their servers, which resulted in this shitstorm. \n\nAIUI Microsoft is claiming that the Azure outage was unrelated to CrowdStrike: [incident report 1K80-N_8](https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status/history/) says the root cause was a bad configuration change.

And since Microsoft is a multi billion dollar company with millions of employees and specialists around the globe, and they hold a massive share by far, they can provide better support than any other actor. Microsoft assumes, understands and also informs their customers that there will be issues but they can always provide solutions. On the other hand, Linux is not business-managed and consorted by some  centralized decision makers. Linux kernel and any specific piece of software is designed and developed by robustness in mind in the first place. Contrary to the other, assuming that issue factor is minimised during the development and supervised by several collaborators, contributors.

This was probably over ten years ago, though, and the fact that Gentoo isn't used for enterprise, I don't think it affected many people at all. \n\nRecently, there was an Ubuntu update that somehow updated a bunch of kernels we had to a -gke version kernel.  That would have been fine, but our client's appliance network drivers don't work in -gke kernels without the -gke-extras package. So suddenly a client lost a lot of kiosks, but thankfully, only in their lab QA testing environment. The fix was you had to open the box up, and either fix grub to reboot to an earlier generic kernel OR install the -gke-extras manually from a USB dongle.

There was a memory leak in gdi+ some years ago that was pretty bad. Gitlab having a hole that required you effectively reinstall the whole machine. Holes in docker, kvm, k8 and Chef. The composer thing from years past. NPM, PPA, nuget all seeing malicious packages going out much like XZ in recent memory.\n\nThe reason for those not being as big was because people acted quickly or machines were not rolled out onto the bad stuff just yet. Linux is much more fragmented ecosystem with its distros and each org sysadmin having their own ideas on when and what to update. There are also usually more options for if I don't want to trust the idiots at Cloudflare with critical things I can get the same stuff from 3 other vendors. The fragmentation also makes it more difficult to write something universally bad unless you want to go through the hoops of gaining the trust of the maintainers of things like openssl or something similar, which is going to only get harder with the way the current climate is moving.\n\nLessons are being learned regardless and that's always a good thing. It would be better if logic was applied in the first place to prevent those things, but money talks. So long as M$ is willing to spend the money and no one fines them big time for their behavior and screw ups nothing will really change. Linux has, in that respect at least, less money directly involved that would be driving poor practices. Not saying that's not the case at all, because it absolutely is, but there is a lot more force behind building a secure platform simply to be able to gloat rather than get rich.

You'd think that the lower market penetration could limit the damage but that is not true for the server and supercomputing space. Linux dominates servers with approx. 70% market share and super computers with 100% (i.e. all of them) of the Top-500. \n\nHowever, Linux is much more diversified than windows. Each company/community has its own policies and subsystems. Even when they use the same subsystems, they are likely to have different versions installed. \n\nTherefore, in theory, your own Linux system may have similar probabilities to fail as a windows system (OK, perhaps much lower for other reasons but this is not the subject here), however, it is unlikely for multiple systems to fail on this scale. \n\nAs for your edit, windows is not bad due to being insecure (they've come a long way the last decade).

      "# Post ID p9egth: CrowdStrike API for Dummies? with +20 score by [(jwckauman, Reddit, 2021-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/p9egth/crowdstrike_api_for_dummies/)\nIs anyone aware of a good resource for getting acclimated with the CrowdStrike API?  Especially for those that are new to APIs in general?  Or would someone be willing to help me get started with our CS API service?  I have gotten our Falcon Complete team to enable it for our account/tenant so technically I have rights to access it.  But I have no idea how I go about doing that.  \n\nJust to give you an example of why I want to learn the CS API, I'd like to do something similar to how I use Excel to 'get data' from various sources like Active Directory, Exchange Server, SQL Server, text & csv files, etc.  I typically pull that data from those sources into an Excel worksheet and then sort, filter, and compare data with other data sources.  For example, I will query Active Directory for 'all computers' and query 'SolarWinds Server & Application Monitor' for all 'nodes' and have it show me all computers in AD that are not in SW SAM.  This allows me to figure out why we might not be monitoring all our computers with SW.  I could see the same application here: \"show me all computers in AD that are not in CS\".  I figured using the API was the quickest method (i'd rather not have to export the hosts file to CSV every time I wanted to run this query).\n\n## Comment ID h9xa6om with +12 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/p9egth/crowdstrike_api_for_dummies/h9xa6om/) (in reply to ID p9egth):\nThis video from Fal.Con last year helped me get started using the APIs CrowdStrike offers.

The [Asset Inventory](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/discover/discover/en-US/app/eam2/discover__asset_inventory) within Falcon Discover can be used to find devices on local subnets without the Falcon Sensor, and pulling data from there might be easier than creating your own integration.\n2. Falcon Complete reviews this data and can notify you when they think you're lacking in sensor coverage.\n\nThere are a few different resources that can help you learn how to use the APIs. The [Falcon OAuth2 API Documentation](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/documentation/46/crowdstrike-oauth2-based-apis) is the first place to go to understand what the OAuth2 APIs are. It provides links to specific APIs, examples of authentication, etc.\n\n[PSFalcon](https://github.com/crowdstrike/psfalcon) makes these APIs easier to use with PowerShell, while [falconpy](https://github.com/crowdstrike/falconpy) and [gofalcon](https://github.com/crowdstrike/gofalcon) make them easier to use with Python and Golang, respectively. If you're completely new to APIs but understand one of these languages, one of these tools will be the best place to start. If you'd like to pull this data directly with Excel, you're going to have to start from scratch, or figure out how you could use Excel to call one of these tools to get your data.\n\nPersonally, I think your easiest route would be to pull data with PSFalcon to CSV and then compare, which leads to the next question -- how do you get specific data? You'll need to understand what APIs are available, test each one and see if it contains what you want. Within PSFalcon, if you're trying to get information about devices, that's `Get-FalconHost`.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>show me all computers in AD that are not in CS\n\nI can think of a couple ways to tackle this. First, you can pull relevant device information, save it to CSV and compare it against your list from AD. The downside with this approach is that it's inefficient to pull this data every time you want it, because a lot of it probably won't change too often.\n\n    Get-FalconHost -Detailed -All | Select-Object device_id, hostname, last_seen, mac_address, local_ip, machine_domain, ou, site_name | Export-FalconReport -Path .\\Hosts.csv\n\nOr, you can pull relevant device information, save locally to a database, and compare on demand using Excel. This is a bit more complicated because you'd need to add in a way for PSFalcon to output it's data directly to a database (maybe a module like [dbatools](https://dbatools.io/)), but you could create a scheduled task to pull device data and update the database with changes.\n\nHere's a query that would pull all devices that have connected to the cloud in the last 24 hours (which could presumably have new data):\n\n    Get-FalconHost -Filter \"last_seen:>'now-24h'\" -Detailed\n\n## Comment ID h9xionr with +3 score by [(niemesrw, Reddit, 2021-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/p9egth/crowdstrike_api_for_dummies/h9xionr/) (in reply to ID p9egth):\nHighly recommend using powershell if you can.

I've seen lots of people at lots of companies who really reject ideas like code quality, testing, automation, etc. Things that should make their jobs easier and safer *in the long run* are rejected often because it feels like *too much work right now*. \n\nThe idea that you might have an organization that isn't using comprehensive, best-practices automated testing isn't far fetched. In fact, I would suggest that it's probably the most common way for companies to be. Remember that almost 100% of all medium- to large-sized companies do some kind of in-house software development, many of which have small teams without the kind of experienced and visionary leadership that you might see in some of the bigger software companies. \n\nIt doesn't surprise me at all that there are companies writing software without tests. And it doesn't surprise me at all when a developer tries to circumvent existing process for the sake of timelines and expediency. \n\nWithout knowing too much about what's going on inside the Crowdstrike development teams, I can pretty confidently say that they wouldn't have had this problem if they had taken testing and quality control processes more seriously. It's not a silver bullet and a lot of other problems are possible, just not this particular problem that bluescreened millions of computers, grounded airlines, closed restaurant chains, and shuttered non-emergency medical services.\n\nI suspect pretty strongly that one of the next priority hires for Crowdstrike is going to be a CTO, software manager, Software dev lead or software architect who has a strong track record in automation, testing, and development best-practices.\n\n### Comment ID lequz4i with +12 score by [(BadUsername_Numbers, Reddit, 2024-07-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1eb40oo/crowdstrike_preliminary_post_incident_review/lequz4i/) (in reply to ID leqerrj):\nBeen working in the software business for almost as long - and honestly, it \\_does\\_ surprise me that this happens.

Deploying kernel updates universally and simultaneously was the real cause of the chaos, more so than the bug. If they had, as they now will, tiered deployment they would have bricked a few thousand machines and found out before bricking millions. Then it would indeed be a QA problem, but not a planetary one. The same bug could have been a P2 if they'd done a canary release, vs a P1++ with a universal release. IMO that's the really big lesson we can all take away.

This includes unit testing, integration testing, performance testing and stress testing. This culminates in a staged sensor rollout process that starts with dogfooding internally at CrowdStrike, followed by early adopters. It is then made generally available to customers. \n\n***Rapid Response Content***  \nNo mention of testing done\n\nI know in our heads it's like, whatever they do for sensor content, must be the same for Rapid Response Content, but...neah - they didn't say that.\n\nThey have a section on testing and deployment of RRC but no clear list of activities they go through, just what components are involved.\n\nThey just did some a release in March for a RRC, which they say they tested. Then they did some more cowboy deployments in April, which they did not specify that they deployed to their staging environment, and since those worked, let's keep doing that...\n\nAnd one more thing about staging environments, it would probably help if they detailed what their \"staging environments\" look like, are those cherry picked VM templates, or are they actually modeled after the myriad of OSs and flavors they have installed in the field?\n\n## Comment ID leungs4 with +3 score by [(wuwei2626, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1eb40oo/crowdstrike_preliminary_post_incident_review/leungs4/) (in reply to ID 1eb40oo):\nGreat breakdown of what/how it actually happened.\nhttps://youtu.be/wAzEJxOo1ts?si=mAm4Hb4SvAkFdJC8\nSkip to the last few minutes if you already understand the difference between level 0 and level 1.\nTheir whole setup/structure is cowboy, not just the testing, and in any sane world this would signal the death of this company.\n\n## Comment ID lev53xb with +1 score by [(pathlesswalker, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1eb40oo/crowdstrike_preliminary_post_incident_review/lev53xb/) (in reply to ID 1eb40oo):\nHow do you get to test in prod?

For months it has felt like no one really cares and everyone collects a check, empty promises and little to no path to promotion and honestly well under compensated to market. Feels like a sinking ship that no one cares to fix and senior leadership is extremely disconnected from day - to - day ops. The company pitches “remote first” but requires to be in office two days a week (total frat house &amp; waste of time) Sad, this place use to be culture first now it seems as though it had totally lost its way and is toying with people’s careers and compensation by being clueless and frankly careless.",

This creates internal/external conflict and hostility. - PTO usage - despite unlimited PTO being the policy, there are managers who monitor, track and limit time off for team members. - Culture Shift: The focus on “world domination” has created a noticeable difference in morale and business operations. People and process first culture has taken a backseat to being the biggest, fastest and strongest security provider. More burnout, more patchy solutions to quickly solve problems that could have been superbly implemented with proper communication and expectations set on timing.",

They serve two masters: we need to fulfill our mission and keep our customers safe, but also continue to grow as fast as we can, and while our customers and Wall Street frequently overlap in what they want and need, sometimes those goals don't always align. Depending on who you ask, there are a lot of focus areas and a ton of priorities. 5 year plans. Speeches at quarterly All hands. Corporate and team goals, and it gets dizzying. The message is often unclear. - I haven't been here forever, but while CrowdStrike has a ton of great people, it's filled with more than its fair share of \"rest and vest\" pre-IPO veterans who like to sit and complain about the good ol' days, even though they don't seem to produce much at all. - To the point above, while I haven't been here forever, in the years I've been here what I have seen is a leadership pullback. As the company's grown, there have been more unannounced re-orgs, execs leaving, and this and that happening with little or reactive communication, which leaves everyone wondering what's up and looking over their shoulder. Corporate comms needs to be re-done with a much clearer focus on transparency. - There is little to no training for managers, and managers aren't evaluated at all on how good they actually are as managers, so it's kind of a roll of the dice in terms of how effective your manager is and how they'll advocate for you. - Related to the above, I cannot explain to you how and why some people get promoted and others don't. There is no track or defined process, so it's very much up in the air behind a secretive and often delayed annual merit cycle. A lot of people were frustrated this year. - Speaking of, merit raises haven't been great lately. If I end up leaving, that will be why. Please give your top performers an incentive to stay! - There's no educational reimbursement at all. - 401k is embarrassingly bad for a company of our size with the revenue we generate.",

This creates internal/external conflict and hostility. - PTO usage - despite unlimited PTO being the policy, there are managers who monitor, track and limit time off for team members. - Culture Shift: The focus on “world domination” has created a noticeable difference in morale and business operations. People and process first culture has taken a backseat to being the biggest, fastest and strongest security provider. More burnout, more patchy solutions to quickly solve problems that could have been superbly implemented with proper communication and expectations set on timing.",

        "cons": "When I was writing this out there were more things than I initially thought, but here goes: - I understand the pressure that leadership is under. They serve two masters: we need to fulfill our mission and keep our customers safe, but also continue to grow as fast as we can, and while our customers and Wall Street frequently overlap in what they want and need, sometimes those goals don't always align. Depending on who you ask, there are a lot of focus areas and a ton of priorities. 5 year plans. Speeches at quarterly All hands. Corporate and team goals, and it gets dizzying. The message is often unclear. - I haven't been here forever, but while CrowdStrike has a ton of great people, it's filled with more than its fair share of \"rest and vest\" pre-IPO veterans who like to sit and complain about the good ol' days, even though they don't seem to produce much at all. - To the point above, while I haven't been here forever, in the years I've been here what I have seen is a leadership pullback. As the company's grown, there have been more unannounced re-orgs, execs leaving, and this and that happening with little or reactive communication, which leaves everyone wondering what's up and looking over their shoulder. Corporate comms needs to be re-done with a much clearer focus on transparency. - There is little to no training for managers, and managers aren't evaluated at all on how good they actually are as managers, so it's kind of a roll of the dice in terms of how effective your manager is and how they'll advocate for you. - Related to the above, I cannot explain to you how and why some people get promoted and others don't. There is no track or defined process, so it's very much up in the air behind a secretive and often delayed annual merit cycle. A lot of people were frustrated this year. - Speaking of, merit raises haven't been great lately. If I end up leaving, that will be why. Please give your top performers an incentive to stay! - There's no educational reimbursement at all. - 401k is embarrassingly bad for a company of our size with the revenue we generate.",

This is my first company where I'm never bothered on the weekends or after hours. - Overall, the future is bright! - This is going to sound Kool-aidy, but it's the best cybersecurity company in the industry.

      "# [Falcon Content Update Remediation and Guidance Hub on 2024-07-25](https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/)\nThe outage was caused by a defect found in a Falcon content update for Windows hosts. Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted. This was not a cyberattack.\n\nWe are working closely with impacted customers and partners to ensure that all systems are restored, so you can deliver the services your customers rely on.\n\nCrowdStrike is operating normally, and this issue does not affect our Falcon platform systems. There is no impact to any protection if the Falcon sensor is installed. Falcon Complete and Falcon OverWatch services are not disrupted.\n\nWe will provide continuous updates through our Support Portal.\n\nWe have mobilized all of CrowdStrike to help you and your teams. If you have questions or need additional support, please reach out to your CrowdStrike representative or Technical Support.\n\nWe know that adversaries and bad actors will try to exploit events like this. I encourage everyone to remain vigilant and ensure that youâre engaging with official CrowdStrike representatives. Our blog and technical support will continue to be the official channels for the latest updates.\n\nNothing is more important to me than the trust and confidence that our customers and partners have put into CrowdStrike. As we resolve this incident, you have my commitment to provide full transparency on how this occurred and steps weâre taking to prevent anything like this from happening again.\n\nGeorge Kurtz\n\nCrowdStrike Founder and CEO\n\nQ: Has this issue been fixed?\n\nChannel File 291 was identified and fixed 78 minutes after it was released, at 1:27 a.m. EDT on July 19. A logic error in our Content Validator (software that performs control checks on content before deployment) has also been fixed, and we are implementing additional enhancements that are explained in the RCA by August 19, 2024.\n\nEach customer environment is unique, with varying degrees of complexity and architectural constraints that can significantly impact remediation timelines. We can confirm that almost all systems have restored operations and are back online. We remain ready to support any customer that continues to experience operational issues.\n\nQ: How does Rapid Response Content make customers more secure?\n\nOur proven security model is built on the reality that stopping evolving cyber threats requires: (i) effective threat intelligence and real-time information about IT infrastructures that are augmented by the experiences of tens of thousands of enterprises; and (ii) speed of threat identification and response that is commensurate with the radically accelerated advanced attacks coming from adversaries.\n\nRapid Response Content is separate and distinct from CrowdStrikeâs on-sensor AI prevention and detection capabilities, but it is an important part of the dynamic protection mechanisms of the CrowdStrike FalconÂ® platform. It fine-tunes and enhances the sensor’s ability to observe specific behaviors at operational speed â without requiring changes to the sensor code. Rapid Response Content is configuration data; it is not code or a kernel driver.\n\nThe Falcon platform â which relies on a unique combination of AI, machine learning and real-time rapid response intelligence â protects customer systems by identifying and remediating the latest advanced threats. That means our customers get the highest level of protection against increasingly sophisticated bad actors. In doing so, we take a comprehensive approach that prioritizes both rigorous testing and rapid response to emerging threats.\n\nQ: What is CrowdStrike doing to help ensure this doesnât happen in the future?\n\nWhile this scenario with Channel File 291 is now incapable of recurring, it informs the process improvements and mitigation steps that CrowdStrike is deploying to help ensure further enhanced resilience.\n\nBased on the findings in the RCA, here are some of the actions CrowdStrike has taken and will take moving forward:\n\nUpdate Content Configuration System test procedures. This work has been completed. This includes upgraded tests for Template Type development, with automated tests for all existing Template Types. Template Types are part of the sensor and contain predefined fields for threat detection engineers to leverage in Rapid Response Content.\n\nAdd additional deployment layers and acceptance checks for the Content Configuration System. This work has been completed with an updated deployment ring process, ensuring Template Instances pass successive deployment rings before rollout into production.\n\nProvide customers additional control over the deployment of Rapid Response Content updates. New capabilities have been implemented and deployed to our cloud that allow customers to control how Rapid Response Content is deployed, with additional functionality planned for the future.Â\n\nPrevent the creation of problematic Channel 291 files. Validation for the number of input fields has been implemented to prevent this issue from happening.\n\nImplement additional checks in the Content Validator. Additional checks are planned for release into production by August 19, 2024.\n\nEnhance bounds checking in the Content Interpreter for Rapid Response Content in Channel File 291. Bounds checking was added on July 25, 2024, with general availability expected August 9, 2024. These fixes are being backported to all Windows sensor versions 7.11 and above through a sensor software hotfix release.\n\nEngage two independent third-party software security vendors to conduct further review of the Falcon sensor code and end-to-end quality control and release processes. This work has begun and will be ongoing as part of our focus on security and resilience by design.\n\nFor additional detail on the actions CrowdStrike has taken and will take moving forward to help ensure this doesn’t happen in the future, please refer to the RCA.\n\nQ: How did CrowdStrike engage with customers and partners to minimize impact?\n\nCrowdStrike began working with customers and partners to bring systems online as quickly as possible, initially through manual remediation. These efforts enabled the systems to come back online within hours following the initial incident.\n\nOn July 22, 2024, CrowdStrike introduced automated techniques to accelerate remediation.\n\nTo further help customers bring systems online as quickly as possible, CrowdStrike deployed personnel and engaged with strategic partner services teams to assist customers with recovery efforts. We also worked to provide continuous and transparent updates to customers throughout our response. As of July 29, 2024, at 8:00 p.m. EDT, ~99% of Windows sensors were online, compared to before the content update. We typically see a variance of ~1% week-over-week in sensor connections.\n\nQ: How should customers think about the companyâs financial strength?\n\nCrowdStrike has always managed the business with financial discipline, and this is showcased by our financial strength.\n\nAs of April 30, 2024, the end of our first quarter fiscal year 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.7 billion. The company also has a $750 million revolving credit facility.\n\nBy delivering value through our industry-leading platform and building resiliency, we create strong and enduring relationships with our customers. For the trailing 12 months ending April 30, 2024, CrowdStrike generated over $1 billion in cash flow, which we believe will enable us to continue investing in the business and cover potential legal liabilities. In addition, we maintain insurance policies that are intended to mitigate the potential impact of certain claims.\n\nOur standard terms and conditions related to customer contracts, including limitations of liability, are laid out on our website (https://www.crowdstrike.com/terms-conditions/).\n\nQ: Does CrowdStrike Falcon have kernel access to the Windows operating system? Is this standard for the industry, and will it continue?\n\nYes. CrowdStrike Falcon, like other cybersecurity products, runs parts of its logic in the kernel of the Windows operating system. Presence in the kernel offers rich visibility into system-wide security-relevant activities, such as process and thread creation or files being written, deleted and modified on disk. This access provides maximum protection against cyber threats.\n\nCrowdStrike certifies each new sensor release, including the latest versions of all channel files at the time of certification, through Microsoftâs Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) program. This includes extensive testing through Microsoftâs Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK).\n\nThe WHQL certification process marks the end of a comprehensive internal testing gauntlet involving functional tests, longevity tests, stress tests with fault injection, fuzzing and performance tests. During the testing required for the WHQL program, the sensors use the latest versions of channel files at the time of certification. Recent reports that any kernel-related processes were bypassed are false. For more information, please see the RCA.\n\nWe are unaware of any plans for Microsoft to remove kernel access from CrowdStrike or any other cybersecurity company.\n\nQ: Did null bytes in Channel File 291 cause the incident?\n\nNo. For additional information, please read the following: Tech Analysis: Channel File May Contain Null Bytes.\n\nThese updates are a regular part of the dynamic protection mechanisms of the Falcon platform. The problematic Rapid Response Content configuration update resulted in a Windows system crash.\n\nSystems in scope include Windows hosts running sensor version 7.11 and above that were online between Friday, July 19, 2024 04:09 UTC and Friday, July 19, 2024 05:27 UTC and received the update. Mac and Linux hosts were not impacted.\n\nThe defect in the content update was reverted on Friday, July 19, 2024 at 05:27 UTC. Systems coming online after this time, or that did not connect during the window, were not impacted.\n\nWhat Went Wrong and Why?\n\nCrowdStrike delivers security content configuration updates to our sensors in two ways:Â Sensor ContentÂ that is shipped with our sensor directly, andÂ Rapid Response ContentÂ that is designed to respond to the changing threat landscape at operational speed.\n\nThe issue on Friday involved a Rapid Response Content update with an undetected error.\n\nSensor Content\n\nSensor Content provides a wide range of capabilities to assist in adversary response. It is always part of a sensor release and not dynamically updated from the cloud. Sensor Content includes on-sensor AI and machine learning models, and comprises code written expressly to deliver longer-term, reusable capabilities for CrowdStrikeâs threat detection engineers.\n\nThese capabilities include Template Types, which have pre-defined fields for threat detection engineers to leverage in Rapid Response Content. Template Types are expressed in code. All Sensor Content, including Template Types, go through an extensive QA process, which includes automated testing, manual testing, validation and rollout steps.\n\nThe sensor release process begins with automated testing, both prior to and after merging into our code base. This includes unit testing, integration testing, performance testing and stress testing. This culminates in a staged sensor rollout process that starts with dogfooding internally at CrowdStrike, followed by early adopters. It is then made generally available to customers. Customers then have the option of selecting which parts of their fleet should install the latest sensor release (âNâ), or one version older (âN-1â) or two versions older (âN-2â) through Sensor Update Policies.\n\nThe event of Friday, July 19, 2024 was not triggered by Sensor Content, which is only delivered with the release of an updated Falcon sensor. Customers have complete control over the deployment of the sensor â which includes Sensor Content and Template Types.\n\nRapid Response Content\n\nRapid Response Content is used to perform a variety of behavioral pattern-matching operations on the sensor using a highly optimized engine. Rapid Response Content is a representation of fields and values, with associated filtering. This Rapid Response Content is stored in a proprietary binary file that contains configuration data. It is not code or a kernel driver.\n\nRapid Response Content is delivered as âTemplate Instances,â which are instantiations of a given Template Type. Each Template Instance maps to specific behaviors for the sensor to observe, detect or prevent. Template Instances have a set of fields that can be configured to match the desired behavior.\n\nIn other words, Template Types represent a sensor capability that enables new telemetry and detection, and their runtime behavior is configured dynamically by the Template Instance (i.e., Rapid Response Content).\n\nRapid Response Content provides visibility and detections on the sensor without requiring sensor code changes. This capability is used by threat detection engineers to gather telemetry, identify indicators of adversary behavior and perform detections and preventions. Rapid Response Content is behavioral heuristics, separate and distinct from CrowdStrikeâs on-sensor AI prevention and detection capabilities.\n\nRapid Response Content Testing and Deployment\n\nRapid Response Content is delivered as content configuration updates to the Falcon sensor. There are three primary systems: the Content Configuration System, the Content Interpreter and the Sensor Detection Engine.\n\nThe Content Configuration System is part of the Falcon platform in the cloud, while the Content Interpreter and Sensor Detection Engine are components of the Falcon sensor. The Content Configuration System is used to create Template Instances, which are validated and deployed to the sensor through a mechanism called Channel Files. The sensor stores and updates its content configuration data through Channel Files, which are written to disk on the host.\n\nThe Content Interpreter on the sensor reads the Channel File and interprets the Rapid Response Content, enabling the Sensor Detection Engine to observe, detect or prevent malicious activity, depending on the customerâs policy configuration. The Content Interpreter is designed to gracefully handle exceptions from potentially problematic content.\n\nNewly released Template Types are stress tested across many aspects, such as resource utilization, system performance impact and event volume. For each Template Type, a specific Template Instance is used to stress test the Template Type by matching against any possible value of the associated data fields to identify adverse system interactions.\n\nTemplate Instances are created and configured through the use of the Content Configuration System, which includes the Content Validator that performs validation checks on the content before it is published.\n\nTimeline of Events: Testing and Rollout of the InterProcessCommunication (IPC) Template Type\n\nSensor Content Release: On February 28, 2024, sensor 7.11 was made generally available to customers, introducing a new IPC Template Type to detect novel attack techniques that abuse Named Pipes. This release followed all Sensor Content testing procedures outlined above in the Sensor Content section.\n\nTemplate Type Stress Testing: On March 05, 2024, a stress test of the IPC Template Type was executed in our staging environment, which consists of a variety of operating systems and workloads. The IPC Template Type passed the stress test and was validated for use.\n\nTemplate Instance Release viaÂ Channel File 291: On March 05, 2024, following the successful stress test, an IPC Template Instance was released to production as part of a content configuration update. Subsequently, three additional IPC Template Instances were deployed between April 8, 2024 and April 24, 2024. These Template Instances performed as expected in production.\n\nWhat Happened on July 19, 2024?\n\nOn July 19, 2024, two additional IPC Template Instances were deployed. Due to a bug in the Content Validator, one of the two Template Instances passed validation despite containing problematic content data.\n\nBased on the testing performed before the initial deployment of the Template Type (on March 05, 2024), trust in the checks performed in the Content Validator, and previous successful IPC Template Instance deployments, these instances were deployed into production.\n\nWhen received by the sensor and loaded into the Content Interpreter, problematic content in Channel File 291 resulted in an out-of-bounds memory read triggering an exception. This unexpected exception could not be gracefully handled, resulting in a Windows operating system crash (BSOD).\n\nHow Do We Prevent This From Happening Again?\n\nSoftware Resiliency and Testing\n\nImprove Rapid Response Content testing by using testing types such as:\n\nLocal developer testing\n\nContent update and rollback testing\n\nStress testing, fuzzing and fault injection\n\nStability testing\n\nContent interface testing\n\nAdd additional validation checks to the Content Validator for Rapid Response Content. A new check is in process to guard against this type of problematic content from being deployed in the future.\n\nEnhance existing error handling in the Content Interpreter.\n\nRapid Response Content Deployment\n\nImplement a staggered deployment strategy for Rapid Response Content in which updates are gradually deployed to larger portions of the sensor base, starting with a canary deployment.\n\nImprove monitoring for both sensor and system performance, collecting feedback during Rapid Response Content deployment to guide a phased rollout.\n\nProvide customers with greater control over the delivery of Rapid Response Content updates by allowing granular selection of when and where these updates are deployed.\n\nProvide content update details via release notes, which customers can subscribe to.\n\nThird Party Validation\n\nConduct multiple independent third-party security code reviews.\n\nConduct independent reviews of end-to-end quality processes from development through deployment.\n\nIn addition to this preliminary Post Incident Review, CrowdStrike is committed to publicly releasing the full Root Cause Analysis once the investigation is complete.",

      "# [Microsoft outages caused by CrowdStrike software glitch paralyze airlines, other businesses. Here's what to know. by Haley Ott on 2024-07-19](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/microsoft-internet-outages-reported-worldwide/)\nBanks, airlines, television networks and health systems around the world that rely on Microsoft 365 apps were hit by widespread outages early Friday linked to the company CrowdStrike. Thousands of flights and train services were canceled globally, including more than 1,800 in the U.S., and there were disruptions to many other public and retail services.\n\nHere's what we know about the outages:\n\nWhat caused the global Microsoft outages?\n\nThe issue was caused by a technical problem that global cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said it had identified in its software and was working to resolve. CrowdStrike provides antivirus software to Microsoft for its Windows devices.\n\n\"Earlier today, a CrowdStrike update was responsible for bringing down a number of IT systems globally,\" Microsoft said in a statement to CBS News.\n\nLater on Friday, Microsoft said on social media that it had \"completed our mitigation actions and our telemetry indicates all previously impacted Microsoft 365 apps and services have recovered. We're entering a period of monitoring to ensure impact is fully resolved.\"\n\nIn a statement, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said the issue had been identified and a solution was being implemented. He added that \"this is not a security incident or cyberattack. The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.\"\n\nIn an update shared Friday afternoon on social media, Kurtz again apologized to those impacted and said he was committed \"to provide full transparency on how this occurred and the steps we're taking to prevent anything like this from happening again.\"\n\nWhat has been affected by the Microsoft outages?\n\nOver 3,000 flights had been canceled within, into or out of the U.S. as of Friday night, and more than 11,400 others were delayed, according to the flight tracking service, FlightAware. Globally, more than 42,000 flights were delayed Friday.\n\nAmerican Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines resumed at least some flight departures later Friday morning after pausing operations earlier in the day due to the outages.\n\n\"We have recovered our operation today and expect to deliver a reliable operation for our customers tomorrow,\" American Airlines said in a statement Friday evening.\n\nAnd Toby Enqvist, chief operations officer for United Airlines, said in a statement late Friday night that \"while we had to cancel and delay far more flights than we ever want to, we are poised to return to a near-normal operation on Saturday.\"\n\nA timelapse shared by the Federal Aviation Administration showed flights resuming Friday afternoon.\n\nBrigham and Women's Hospital in Boston canceled all previously scheduled surgeries and medical visits that were not considered urgent because many of the computer systems were down, preventing access to vital digital records.\n\n\"We do everything on our computers now,\" neuro ICU nurse Meghan Mahoney told CBS News. \"…People's medical history, their allergies. So when that goes down, we have to revert back to paper charting.\"\n\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City postponed all procedures requiring anesthesia. Emory Healthcare system in Atlanta delayed certain types of surgeries. Seattle Children's Hospital closed its outpatient clinic.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said on Friday afternoon it was \"working to assess the impact of the CrowdStrike outage on patient care and HHS systems, services, and operations.\"\n\nA Department of Homeland Security memo to staff obtained by CBS News said that \"DHS systems are currently impacted by a global outage of the cybersecurity software CrowdStrike. This is impacting many businesses globally, as you may be seeing in the news. This was not a cyberattack.\"\n\nPortland, Oregon Mayor Ted Wheeler issued an Emergency Declaration for the city on Friday. The declaration will allow for \"immediate response and resources to get city systems back to fully operational levels.\" In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams said the outage did not have a major impact on city operations because of previous drills that had been conducted to educate officials on how to respond to an IT issue.\n\nIn Europe, Lufthansa, KLM and SAS Airlines reported disruptions. Switzerland's largest airport reported planes had not been allowed to land, according to CBS News partner network BBC News. In India, at the country's primary airport in Delhi, everything was being done manually. No electric check-in terminals were functioning and gate information was being updated by hand on a whiteboard, the BBC reported.\n\nHospitals in Germany said they were canceling elective surgeries Friday and doctors in the U.K. said they were having issues accessing their online booking system. Pharmacists in the U.K. said there were disruptions with medicine deliveries and accessing prescriptions.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation said there were no operational problems related to the outage, though some of its systems had been affected. Those systems have workarounds that allow their use even amid the outage.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange said it had experienced disruptions to its regulatory news service, but that trading had not been impacted. A spokesperson for the New York Stock Exchange said markets were fully operational and a normal opening was expected.\n\nStarbucks said the outage was preventing customers from using its mobile ordering features. Delivery companies like FedEx also reported that some packages could be delayed due to the outages.\n\n\"FedEx has activated contingency plans to mitigate impacts from a global IT outage experienced by a third party software vendor. However, potential delays are possible for package deliveries with a commitment of July 19, 2024,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nWhen will the Microsoft outages be fixed?\n\nEven with the fix being implemented by CrowdStrike, some of the problems caused will likely take time to solve, Chief Information Officer at identity security firm CyberArk, Omer Grossman, told Reuters. He said the reason is that the problem has to do with Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) products that run on individual client computers.\n\n\"It turns out that because the endpoints have crashed — the Blue Screen of Death — they cannot be updated remotely and the problem must be solved manually, endpoint by endpoint. This is expected to be a process that will take days,\" Grossman said.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, CrowdStrike's Kurtz said many of the affected systems were already beginning to recover, and a fix could be as straightforward for some clients as rebooting their computers or servers.\n\nHe acknowledged, however, that \"some systems may not fully recover, and we're working individually with each and every customer to make sure we can get them up and running and operational.\"\n\nKurtz did not provide a timeframe, and it appeared that many companies and organizations around the world would have to rely on their own technology departments to get systems back up and running.\n\n— Kris Van Cleave contributed to this report.",
      "# [$1.94B in Expected Healthcare Losses Due to CrowdStrike Disruption by Pietje Kobus on 2024-08-13](https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/cybersecurity/news/55132837/194b-in-expected-healthcare-losses-due-to-crowdstrike-disruption)\nLast week, CrowdStrike released its root cause analysis of the July 19 Channel File 291 incident, which prompted a global outage. According to CrowdStrike’s investigation, the incident was caused by an error in a Rapid Response content update delivered to certain Windows hosts. The faulty update caused many hospitals to cancel appointments and delay services, incurring significant financial losses.\n\nIn the report, CrowdStrike explained that it introduced a new sensor capability to enable visibility into possible attack techniques in February. The capability predefined a set of fields for Rapid Response Content to gather data. After previous successful updates following a stress test, when the July 19 update was delivered, the sensor expected 20 input fields, while the update provided 21 fields. This mismatch resulted in an out-of-bounds memory read, causing the system to crash.\n\n“The biggest losses are thought to have been experienced by the healthcare industry,” reported Steve Alder on August 8 for The HIPAA Journal. “Healthcare is estimated to have suffered direct losses of $1.94 billion, with an average estimated loss of $64.6 million per company, with the banking sector also experiencing high losses of $1.15 billion and an average loss of $71.84 million per company. These two sectors will have to absorb more than half of the total financial losses caused by the outage.” “The overall losses at airlines are lower at an estimated $860 million,” Alder wrote.\n\n“As of 8:00 p.m. EDT on July 29, 2024, ~99% of Windows sensors were back online, compared to before the content update and using a week-over-week comparison,” said CrowdStrike’s founder and CEO, George Kurtz, in a statement.",
      "# [CrowdStrike, Microsoft Outage: Is Tech Too Vulnerable? by Cliff Djajapranata on 2024-07-25](https://www.georgetown.edu/news/ask-a-professor-crowdstrike-outage/)\nLast week, travelers were left stranded at airports, patients left waiting in hospitals and customers left cash-strapped in front of banks after a software update gone awry disrupted major sectors of the global economy.\n\nThe historic outage was the result of a faulty update from the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike that affected millions of computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system.\n\n“One takeaway from this incident is how disruptive an actual malicious and widespread cyberattack could be,” said Laura DeNardis, professor and endowed Chair in Technology, Ethics, and Society and director of the Center for Digital Ethics. DeNardis teaches in the graduate program in Communication, Culture & Technology and the undergraduate program in Tech, Ethics and Society. She is also a member of Georgetown’s Tech & Society initiative, an interdisciplinary collaboration conducting research at the intersection of technology, ethics and governance.\n\nThe incident has raised important questions relating to the vulnerability of the world’s technological infrastructure and the possible consequences of widespread malicious cyberattacks.\n\nTo understand these questions, read DeNardis’ take on the CrowdStrike outage and potential strategies to build up resilience in the world’s technology systems.\n\nAsk a Professor: Laura DeNardis on the CrowdStrike Outage and Securing Cyberspace\n\nThe world just experienced a widespread technical outage linked to a company called CrowdStrike. What exactly happened on Friday, July 19, 2024?\n\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike pushed out a routine software update that inadvertently crashed customers’ Windows systems. The very purpose of the update involved a core cybersecurity mission of detecting emerging threats and, specifically, gathering data “on possible novel threat techniques.” Instead, an error in the software update triggered a problem that gave customers the Window’s “Blue Screen of Death.”\n\nAs CrowdStrike immediately explained to customers and the world, the problem was not a cyberattack but an error in the software update. Because the bug was in CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform update for Microsoft Windows, computers using other operating systems (e.g. Mac and Linux) were not impacted. Because so many core systems in society rely upon CrowdStrike, the outage was widespread and disruptive across critical sectors: flights canceled, medical procedures delayed or canceled and many other routine societal systems affected.\n\nThe regrettable irony is that the effect of the outage — caused by an error in software designed to stop widespread cybersecurity attacks — ended up mimicking what would be the effects of an actual widespread cybersecurity attack.\n\nWhy did the problem have such a massive impact across so many industries?\n\nThe 8.5 million Windows devices that Microsoft estimated as affected by the CrowdStrike update error represented less than 1% of Windows devices. So why was the outage so widespread? The organizations that operate critical societal infrastructure are the very institutions that implement cybersecurity services such as those provided by CrowdStrike. Every crucial sector uses specialized cybersecurity services — agriculture, airlines, banking, energy, government, healthcare, manufacturing, retail and more. These were the sectors affected by the outage. Regulators were quick to ask how greater market diversity in the tech industry would have dampened the impact, one topic among many that will no doubt arise in forthcoming hearings on the Hill.\n\nThe much larger issue is that everything is digitally connected. As I explained in a recent book, an outage is not just about what we do through a computer screen or phone but about the connected critical infrastructure and cyber-physical objects all around us. An outage is no longer about an inability to send an email or access files but about the right to receive medical care or travel freely. Everything from our food supply to our energy systems depends upon secure and resilient digital technologies.\n\nThe CrowdStrike incident was caused by a faulty update rather than a cyberattack. How have hackers taken advantage of the situation?\n\nAlthough the outage was not a cyberattack, hackers quickly capitalized on the chaos. Malicious activity in the aftermath of the outage used “social engineering” techniques designed to trick people into taking some action that could harm them or their organization. The United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned that “Cyber threat actors continue to leverage the outage to conduct malicious activity.” The social engineering techniques included phishing attacks trying to trick people into downloading malware, divulging security credentials or making financial payments. Fake websites arose. CrowdStrike Intelligence published a running list of websites fraudulently impersonating CrowdStrike. CrowdStrike also disclosed that hackers were circulating a malicious ZIP file largely targeting Latin American customers.\n\nThis ecosystem of social engineering techniques is a reminder that cybersecurity is about our human defenses as much as our technical defenses.\n\nWhat are your takeaways from this incident? What does this outage portend about future cyberattacks?\n\nMedia and government attention around tech policy over focuses on social media content problems while often ignoring the more critical issues around underlying infrastructure. There are hidden layers of infrastructure — cybersecurity platforms, protocols, the Domain Name System, routing and addressing, satellite systems — upon which everything depends. My book on internet governance addresses how the design, operation and governance of these underlying infrastructures are the new spaces where economic and geopolitical power are unfolding.\n\nFor decades, there have been predictions of a “digital Pearl Harbor,” yet the internet and digital technologies have endured. A continuous stream of ransomware attacks, government-ordered outages around the world, worms, viruses and attacks on critical infrastructure have been highly problematic but not globally catastrophic.\n\nYet, one takeaway from this incident is how disruptive an actual malicious and widespread cyberattack could be. This incident affected a small number of computers relative to connected devices around the world. CrowdStrike employees identified the problem quickly and transparently communicated to the world that this was not a cyberattack but an update error. They released solutions to mitigate the problem and explained what they will do differently in the future, such as more rigorous testing of updates. Still, the outage was devastating and helps people imagine what could happen in a more widespread outage or targeted attack. In my opinion, the most catastrophic attacks would be ones that target our energy grid or satellite systems.\n\nThe incident also raises important questions about liability, accountability and deterrence. The losses from this one incident will likely be measured in billions of dollars. Liability clarification in complex digital systems is a governance area that needs to be addressed. Additionally, cyber insurance is now a routine strategy for large and small organizations. The focus of these policies is often on malicious security incidents such as the cost of a data breach or ransomware attack. This incident was not an intentional act, so it emphasizes the importance of including non-malicious disruptions as part of insurance strategies.\n\nIs there anything we should all do to secure ourselves?\n\nThe outage is a reminder that even people who have never even been online can be profoundly impacted by an outage or cyberattack. The aftermath of the CrowdStrike outage included families sleeping on airport floors. Someone who has never been online could have still been affected by the massive data breaches at Target, Home Depot or the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. Ransomware attacks on hospital systems have caused ambulances to divert from emergency rooms and have prevented patients from receiving care. Cybersecurity is a society-wide problem requiring multi-stakeholder strategies from the private sector, technical coordinating bodies and governments.\n\nStill, the majority of us that are connected can help reduce cyber risk. Most people understand the basics of access protection: using complex passwords, avoiding re-use of the same login credentials, using multi-factor authentication (MFA). Other best practices for protecting our own systems and data include keeping software up-to-date, preferably through automatic updates; regularly backing up files, both locally and using cloud computing services; never using unsecured Wi-Fi networks; and using a virtual private network (VPN).\n\nThe more difficult issues are psychological rather than technical. Fraud and cybercrime due to social engineering techniques continues to increase. Hackers have become very good at tricking people into responding to a text message, clicking on a link in an email, making payments or disclosing personal information. Staying informed about current cybersecurity threats is critical.\n\nOne of the core research areas of Georgetown’s Center for Digital Ethics is cybersecurity ethics. Why is cybersecurity an ethics area?\n\nEverything in society now depends upon strong cybersecurity — privacy, national security, financial transactions, basic critical infrastructures keeping society functioning. There are ethical dilemmas deeply embedded in the design, operation, governance and use of cybersecurity. Cybersecurity policy choices involve fundamental ethical choices, such as encryption strength debates, ransomware responses and the moral obligation to secure medical devices. For example, governments have an interest in strong encryption for national security but also an interest in weaker encryption for foreign intelligence and law enforcement functions. As digital technologies continue to move into the physical and biological world — including intersections with quantum computing and neuroscience — the ethical complexities only rise. Cybersecurity is a great human rights issue of our time and part of the Center’s core mission of bringing about a more ethical digital future.",
      "# [Healthcare recovering from CrowdStrike outage on 2024-07-22](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/healthcare-recovering-crowdstrike-outage)\nMany affected health systems say they're back up and running, days after a global IT outage caused by a faulty CrowdStrike update that took millions of Microsoft systems offline on July 19. The outage affected industries around the world – not least healthcare, where it caused some providers to revert to pen and paper after losing access to electronic health records and other mission-critical systems.\n\nGetting computers to boot up beyond the blue screen of death took machine-by-machine troubleshooting from exhausted IT workers in many cases, and was also accomplished through large-scale deployments orchestrated by Crowdstrike, Microsoft and others.\n\nAs the dust settles – the event is still causing flight cancellations and delays for the airline industry – experts say the global disruption offers an object lesson in technology's vulnerabilities, and should provoke hard questions about interoperable system design and providers' operational preparedness during mass outages.\n\nRisks to patient care\n\nOver the weekend Mass General Brigham patient portal users were pleased to see the statement: \"Mass General Brigham hospitals are open and seeing patients. All scheduled appointments and procedures will happen as planned on Monday, July 22.\"\n\nThe critical incident message at the Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust health system in England disappeared Saturday morning when the critical incident was stepped down.\n\nWhile Mass General Brigham remained open during the worldwide IT outage, and provided care to patients with urgent health concerns in the group's clinics and emergency departments, all previously scheduled nonurgent surgeries, procedures and medical visits were canceled Friday.\n\nBeing back to operational is hopefully a relief to patients like Doreen Richards, who told Channel 5 ABC Boston that she traveled to the city only to have her pre-op visit canceled by the outage, while others who had scheduled surgeries and life-saving therapies were delayed either at the hospital or at home.\n\nUnlike in banking, the accidental outage poses bodily risks to consumer safety.\n\n\"It is a tech outage, not a cyberattack, so there is no risk to the safety of your money. Even issues accessing money would be temporary in nature until a fix is deployed,\" Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com told AARP.\n\nService credits and potential lawsuits\n\nIt appears that remuneration from CrowdStrike is likely to be in the form of returned payments for services, according to Business Insider, which took a look at the third-party vendor's contract terms.\n\nConsumers not treated fairly on returned payments for the loss of services are advised to take it up directly with the companies, such as when a canceled flight cannot be rebooked for a later date and the airline will only issue a credit.\n\nWhile no major patient suits were quickly filed after Friday's tech outage, and it can take time, like the lawsuit filed last week for a January 31 cyberattack on Lurie Children's Hospital – patients have sued over other types of outages.\n\nTo hasten a return to operations, Microsoft worked with CrowdStrike and others to address the approximately 8.5 million devices affected.\n\n\"Since this event began, we’ve maintained ongoing communication with our customers, CrowdStrike and external developers to collect information and expedite solutions,\" the company said in an online statement on Saturday.\n\n\"We recognize the disruption this problem has caused for businesses and in the daily routines of many individuals. Our focus is providing customers with technical guidance and support to safely bring disrupted systems back online.\"\n\nMicrosoft said it took steps to:\n\nEngage with CrowdStrike to automate their work on developing a solution.\n\nDeploy hundreds of Microsoft engineers and experts to work directly with customers to restore services.\n\nCollaborate with other cloud providers and stakeholders, including Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services to share awareness on the state of impact we are each seeing across the industry and inform ongoing conversations with CrowdStrike and customers.\n\nPost manual remediation documentation and scripts.\n\nKeep customers informed of the latest status on the incident through the Azure Status Dashboard.\n\nImportant to restoring services at healthcare organizations and others on Azure, Microsoft said CrowdStrike helped it develop a scalable patch that would accelerate \"a fix for CrowdStrike’s faulty update\" customer assets on the cloud.\n\nToo big to fail?\n\nCrowdStrike's outage may end up being the worst information-technology disaster in history, although major cloud providers have experienced outages in the past. In 2017, Amazon S3 cloud went down, affecting the functionality of websites and applications across healthcare.\n\n\"This incident demonstrates the interconnected nature of our broad ecosystem — global cloud providers, software platforms, security vendors and other software vendors and customers,\" Microsoft acknowledged in its statement Saturday.\n\n\"It’s also a reminder of how important it is for all of us across the tech ecosystem to prioritize operating with safe deployment and disaster recovery using the mechanisms that exist.\"\n\nThe event, which did not affect systems that were not using CrowdStrike such as nearly all systems in China, was not unimaginable.\n\nModern social systems \"have been designed for hyperconnected optimization, not decentralized resilience\" and this event should be regarded as a warning, according to The Atlantic.\n\nFor healthcare, with its preponderance of third-party providers, it's another opportunity to test its contingency plans to minimize disruptions to patients' lives.\n\nAndrea Fox is senior editor of Healthcare IT News.\n\nEmail: afox@himss.org\n\nHealthcare IT News is a HIMSS Media publication.",
      "# [What we know about the computer update glitch disrupting systems around the world by Bobby Allyn, Brian Mann, Bill Chappell, Fatima Al-Kassab on 2024-07-19](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/19/g-s1-12222/microsoft-outage-banks-airlines-broadcasters)\nA technological meltdown left employees of airlines, banks, hospitals and emergency services around the world staring at the dreaded “blue screen of death” on Friday as their computers went inert in what is being described as a historic outage.\n\n“This is basically what we were all worried about with Y2K, except it's actually happened this time,” internet security analyst Troy Hunt said via X.\n\nFrom continent to continent, Microsoft users reported being suddenly knocked offline, and the culprit was determined to be cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, which says one of its routine software updates malfunctioned.\n\n“CrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,” the company said in a statement.\n\nCustomers using Mac and Linux operating systems were not affected, CrowdStrike said.\n\nWhen the faulty update crashed computer systems, scores of airport travelers were stranded, hospital appointments were delayed and live news broadcasts were cut short.\n\nHow big is the outage?\n\nIt is massive, far-reaching and sudden.\n\nSome computer problems cascade, creating ripples of failures. But in this case, the flaw permeated Microsoft systems worldwide nearly immediately. The company says its Windows 365 Cloud PCs, apps and services were affected.\n\nMicrosoft remains the dominant desktop operating system worldwide, with more than 72% market share, according to the Statcounter website. The CrowdStrike problem does not directly affect all of those machines: its security software is mainly used by businesses and large organizations. The company says its customers include 43 U.S. states and nearly 300 companies in the Fortune 500.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Microsoft outages were reported on Friday, according to Downdetector, the website that tracks outages based on users’ reports.\n\nIn 16 hours, 311,000 global outage reports came in, Michelle Badrian, senior communications manager at Ookla, which owns Downdetector, told NPR. Of that figure, she added, 58,000 reports were from the U.S., 26,000 from the U.K., and 20,000 from India. Large numbers of reports also came in from Germany, Canada and Australia.\n\nThere are signs that relief is on the way: Badrian said that as of midday Friday ET, “we are observing report volumes declining both for Microsoft services and for all services overall.”\n\nWhile server-related outages are common, the scale of the CrowdStrike disruption was astonishing to many tech observers.\n\n“This IT outage is a stark reminder of how dependent we are on technology and many other things that happen behind the scenes that most of us are unaware of,” said Louisville-based tech executive Adam Robinson on X. “Modern society and the many comforts we enjoy is a fragile thing.”\n\nWhat about air travel?\n\nMore than 2,000 flights originating or landing in the U.S. were canceled as of noon ET Friday, and more than twice that number were delayed, according to the FlightAware tracking site.\n\nDelta Airlines, United Airlines and American Airlines announced they were resuming some or all of their scheduled flights after initially being grounded when the problem struck their systems. The airlines also said they were issuing waivers to affected customers.\n\nAmsterdam’s Schiphol Airport — a major hub for long-distance flights — said a \"global system failure\" impacted incoming and outgoing flights on one of the busiest days of the year.\n\nLandings at Zurich airport were suspended and flights in Hungary disrupted.\n\nSpanish airport operator Aena reported a computer systems “incident” at all Spanish airports that it said could cause delays.\n\nWhat other kinds of services went offline?\n\nIn some states, including Alaska and Ohio, 911 phone lines were down.\n\nThe U.K.’s National Health Service has been widely affected. The NHS said Friday that doctors’ appointments and patient records had been affected but that there was no known impact on emergency services. The BBC reported that two-thirds of doctors’ practices in Northern Ireland had been affected, with doctors unable to access patient records, generate prescriptions or see the result of laboratory tests.\n\nIn Germany, some hospitals canceled non-emergency operations.\n\nBroadcasters around the world were also affected. In France and Australia, live television broadcasts were knocked offline.\n\nSky News, a major U.K. news channel, was off air for a time on Friday morning. It later returned, but without “full capabilities,” its chairman, David Rhodes, said on X Friday afternoon. A post on Australia’s ABC News website said the broadcaster was experiencing a “major network outage.”\n\nThe London Stock Exchange’s news service stopped working. Shipping in the Baltic was also impacted, with the container hub of Gdansk in Poland hit by major disruptions.\n\nHow do people fix their computers?\n\nCrowdStrike says the problem was not a cyberattack, but rather a software glitch. The company said that after identifying the issue, it withdrew the \"problematic channel file\" that was affecting customers' systems.\n\nBecause of that move, if a Windows system with CrowdStrike's Falcon sensor was brought online after 1:27 a.m. ET Friday , the company said, it wouldn't be affected.\n\nIt also published a workaround that involves booting a Windows machine in a recovery environment, deleting a single file in the CrowdStrike directory, and restarting.\n\nWhat is CrowdStrike?\n\nIt’s a U.S. cybersecurity firm based in Austin, Texas. The company went public in 2019 and is currently in the S&P 500 index. As of early July, CrowdStrike’s stock had been riding months of gains. But share prices fell sharply in early trading Friday.\n\n“This is clearly a major black eye for CrowdStrike,” said WedBush analyst Dan Ives.\n\nCrowdStrike made headlines in 2016, when the company was hired by the Democratic National Committee to investigate a breach of its data systems. CrowdStrike determined that the hack was a case of foreign interference — the work of Russian-backed hacking groups.\n\nThe company’s marquee product is its “Falcon” cybersecurity software — and it traced the current problem to a change in a sensor in that system. That also helps explain how and why the resulting failures might have spread so quickly: Rather than being stored locally, the Falcon security platform “is 100% cloud-based.”\n\nThe company apologized for the outages on Friday, stating, \"We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption.\"\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.",
      "# [CrowdStrike global outage: Sophos guidance on 2024-07-23](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2024/07/23/crowdstrike-global-outage-sophos-guidance/)\nOn July 19, 2024, CrowdStrike rolled out a “content update” to its customers running the CrowdStrike Falcon endpoint agent on Windows devices, resulting in disruption to organizations worldwide in multiple industries, including travel, banking, healthcare, and retail.\n\nThreat actors commonly use large scale disruptions and incidents as opportunities to take advantage of victims. In this post, we provide clarity on Sophos’ understanding of what happened, and answer key follow-up questions from our customers and partners.\n\nThe goal of all companies in the cybersecurity space, Sophos and competitors alike, is to keep organizations safe and protect them from attackers. While we compete with one another on the commercial stage, we are – most importantly – a community united against cybercriminals as a common enemy. We extend our peer support to CrowdStrike at this time and wish every affected organization a swift recovery and return to normalcy.\n\nCybersecurity is an incredibly complex, rapidly evolving landscape. “For those of us with the skin-in-the-game of living in the kernel, it’s probably happened to us at one time or another, and whatever precautionary steps we take, we are never 100% immune” said Joe Levy, CEO of Sophos, on LinkedIn.\n\nIssue summary\n\nThis was not the result of a security incident at CrowdStrike and was not a cyberattack.\n\nAlthough it was not the result of a security incident, cybersecurity consists of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Availability was clearly impacted, so this is categorically a cybersecurity failure.\n\nThe issue, which resulted in a blue-screen-of-death (BSOD) on Windows machines, was caused by a product “content” update rolled out to CrowdStrike customers.\n\nOrganizations running CrowdStrike Falcon agents on Windows computers and servers may have been impacted. Linux and macOS devices were not affected by this incident.\n\nCrowdStrike identified the content deployment related to this issue and reverted those changes. Remediation guidance has been issued to CrowdStrike customers.\n\nA note about “content” updates\n\nThis was a typical product “content” update to CrowdStrike’s endpoint security software—the type of update that many software providers (including Sophos) need to make regularly.\n\nContent updates, sometimes called protection updates, improve an endpoint security product’s protection logic and its ability to detect the latest threats. On this occasion, a content update from CrowdStrike had significant unforeseen consequences. However, no software provider is infallible, and issues such as this can (and do) affect other vendors, regardless of industry.\n\nCrowdStrike response\n\nCrowdStrike has issued a statement on its website with remediation guidance for its customers. If you are affected by the issue or receive inquiries from your customers who use CrowdStrike, please refer to this official CrowdStrike page:\n\nhttps://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/\n\nAs always, vigilance is critical. Cybercriminals are registering potentially malicious domains (typo-squatting) and using “CrowdStrike remediation” in phishing campaigns to try to take advantage of victims. If you contact or are contacted by CrowdStrike, please validate that you are talking with an authorized representative.\n\nWere Sophos customers impacted by the CrowdStrike incident?\n\nCustomers using Sophos for endpoint protection, including those using Sophos Endpoint with Sophos XDR or Sophos MDR, were unaffected. A small number of customers who use the Sophos “XDR Sensor” agent (available with Sophos XDR and Sophos MDR) as an overlay on top of CrowdStrike Falcon may have been affected.\n\nWhat does Sophos do to mitigate the risk of having a similar service disruption?\n\nEvery endpoint protection product, including Sophos Endpoint, provides regular product updates and continually publishes protection (content) updates. Threats adapt rapidly, and timely protection logic updates are essential to keep up with the constantly evolving threat landscape.\n\nHaving provided leading endpoint protection solutions for over three decades, and learning many lessons from past Sophos and industry incidents, Sophos has robust processes and procedures to mitigate the risk of customer disruption. However, that risk is never zero.\n\nAt Sophos, all product updates are tested in internal, purpose-built quality assurance environments before being released into production. Once in production, product updates are released internally to all Sophos employees and infrastructure worldwide.\n\nOnly once all internal testing is complete, and we are satisfied that the update meets the quality criteria, will the update be gradually released to customers. The release will start slowly, increasing in velocity, and staggered across the customer base. Telemetry is collected and analyzed in real time. If there is an issue with an update, only a small number of systems will be affected, and Sophos can roll back very quickly.\n\nCustomers can optionally control Sophos Endpoint product updates (not protection updates) using update management policy settings. Software package options include Recommended (Sophos-managed), Fixed-term support, and Long-term support, with the ability to schedule the day and time when updates should occur.\n\nAs with product updates, all Sophos Endpoint content updates are tested in our quality assurance environments before they are released into production, with each release reviewed to ensure that it meets our quality standards. Content releases to customers are staged as part of our ongoing QA controls and we monitor and adjust releases based on telemetry as necessary.",

The outage disrupted businesses and services, including airlines, banks and hospitals.\n\nIn a detailed review of the incident, CrowdStrike said there was a \"bug\" in a system designed to ensure software updates worked properly.\n\nCrowdStrike said the glitch meant \"problematic content data\" in a file went undetected.\n\nThe company said it could prevent a repeat of the incident with better software testing and checks, including more scrutiny from developers.",

The defective software update it deployed Friday quickly rendered global IT networks non-operational.\n\nThe sensor configuration update for CrowdStrike’s Falcon sensor software was released at 4:09 UTC on Friday, shortly after midnight in the Eastern time zone, the company said in the SEC filing. “We identified and isolated the issue and the update was reverted at 5:27 UTC.”\n\nThe company reiterated the outages it caused for customers using certain Windows systems was not the result of a cyberattack, and it pointed to remediation information and updates published on its blog. Systems running Falcon on Windows version 7.11 and above that downloaded the updated configuration during those 78 minutes were “susceptible to a system crash,” CrowdStrike said.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nEven though CrowdStrike pulled the update barely an hour after its release, the damage was already done for many customers on certain Windows systems that encountered an endless reboot loop and the blue screen of death.\n\nCrowdStrike’s update impacted an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices, less than 1% of all Windows machines, according to Microsoft.\n\nThe state of automated cloud-based software, which follows a common practice of continuous integration and continuous delivery, is such that software updates are deployed at once for many customers at scale.\n\nCrowdStrike’s Falcon platform runs on cloud-native architecture and a set of automated tools and processes in the CI/CD pipeline, according to the company's product descriptions. This includes components for automated testing and a staging environment for quality assurance and A/B testing before the application is deployed into production.\n\nThe company has not explained how the defective update, which triggered a logic error resulting in a system crash, made it into the hands of customers. CrowdStrike did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the SEC filing, CrowdStrike CFO Burt Podbere said the situation is evolving, adding: “We continue to evaluate the impact of the event on our business and operations.”\n\nThough CrowdStrike reverted the update, customer systems that were already upgraded and crashing due to the defect could not simply go back to the previous stable version. CrowdStrike demonstrated self-remediation steps for impacted customers in a video released Monday.\n\nMany impacted customers had to manually fix the issue in a multistep process internally.\n\n“Almost all of our systems were hit and that meant more than 26,000 computers and devices had to be manually fixed by technicians, one at a time, at each of our contact centers and 365 airports around the world,” United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said Monday in a post on LinkedIn.",

The CrowdStrike error required Delta’s IT teams to manually repair and reboot each of the affected systems, with additional time then needed for applications to synchronize and start communicating with each other.\n\nDelta’s crews are fully staffed and ready to serve our customers, but one of Delta’s most critical systems – which ensures all flights have a full crew in the right place at the right time – is deeply complex and is requiring the most time and manual support to synchronize.\n\nAcross the operation, Delta teams are working tirelessly to care for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as the airline works to put flight crews and aircraft back in position following the disruption.\n\nWe’re also working to make it right for our customers, starting with these steps:\n\nExtending a travel waiver. Delta extended a travel waiver for all customers with travel booked from July 19-23. The waiver offers customers the ability to make a one-time change to their itinerary. The fare difference for customers will be waived when rebooked travel occurs on or before July 28, in the same cabin of service as originally booked. Customers are encouraged to manage changes to their travel via delta.com or the Fly Delta app.\n\nRight to a Refund Upon Request. Customers whose travel has been disrupted due to a canceled or significantly delayed flight may choose to cancel their travel and receive an eCredit for the unflown portion of the trip, or may instead request a refund for the unflown portion of the trip at delta.com/refund.\n\nIssuing SkyMiles Program miles or a travel voucher in an amount based on the customer’s affected travels.\n\nCovering eligible expenses resulting from this flight disruption, including providing meal vouchers, hotel accommodations where available and ground transportation.\n\nReimbursement of eligible expenses. Customers who have incurred hotel, meal or ground transportation expenses while in transit during this operational disruption may submit eligible expenses for reimbursement.*\n\nReaching out to customers about cancellations and rebooking options. Delta is notifying customers about delays and cancellations in their itinerary via the Fly Delta app and text message, and offering rebooking options that can be managed online.\n\nWhile customers can monitor and manage their itineraries on Delta.com or on the Fly Delta app, these online tools have been inundated with traffic, causing intermittent performance challenges. Delta teams are working to stabilize those tools.

      "# [Crowdstrike CFO brushes off legal threats over global outage by Richard Speed on 2024-09-09](https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/09/crowdstrike_legal_threats/)\nCrowdStrike has yet to face a lawsuit over July's global IT meltdown, according to CFO Burt Podbere.\n\nPodbere was speaking during a Citi technology conference in which he tackled the outage and its impact on the company head on. The global IT meltdown was caused by a configuration update file that CrowdStrike's software could not parse. The result was Blue Screens of Death popping up on Windows systems worldwide.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Podbere put a brave face on things. \"In the short term, people were upset,\" he said. However, according to the CFO, customers came around and appreciated CrowdStrike's attempts to explain the disruption and get them back up and running.\n\nPodbere acknowledged there had been some impact on the company's financials – unavoidable considering that CrowdStrike recently published its Q2 earnings report in which annual recurring revenue (ARR) increased, but the full year forecast was cut. He also noted the customer commitment packages designed to appease those most affected, but did not mention the infamous $10 UberEats gift codes issued to partners and teammates as the chaos unfolded.\n\nThe specter of impending lawsuits does, however, loom over the company. \"As of this morning, to the best of my knowledge, we actually haven't seen a lawsuit against us by a customer for the incident,\" Podbere said at the event held on September 4. Still, it is hard not to imagine lawyers sharpening their claws.\n\nHouse to grill CrowdStrike exec on epic IT meltdown... no, not the CEO\n\nCrowdStrike's meltdown didn't dent its market dominance … yet\n\nCrowdStrike deja vu as 'performance issue' leaves systems sluggish\n\nCrowdStrike president cheered after accepting 'Epic Fail' Pwnie award\n\nThere were dark rumblings from Delta Air Lines last month, for example, threatening litigation over alleged gross negligence. At the time, CrowdStrike reiterated its apologies, saying: \"Public posturing about potentially bringing a meritless lawsuit against CrowdStrike as a long-time partner is not constructive to any party.\"\n\nDuring his time at the Citi conference, Podbere admitted: \"We don't know how it's all going to shake out.\n\n\"Everything we're doing and trying to do is take the legal discussion away from our interaction with customers and move it to the business discussion.\n\n\"And as time goes on, that does get easier because we're moving further away from the Sun, right? And that's how we think about it.\"\n\nIt's perhaps the best approach when faced with legal threats – ignore them and hope they go away. Unfortunately for Podbere, however, the fallout from the outage is unlikely to go away soon. A VP from the company has been called to testify before the US House Homeland Security Committee later this month, and no legal action against CrowdStrike is improbable.\n\nWe asked Delta Air Lines for its thoughts on Podbere's statement, but the company has not replied. ®",

This incident was not a result of a cyberattack but rather a defect in a content update for the Falcon platform, leading to widespread system crashes, commonly referred to as the \"blue screen of death\" [(ABC News, 2024)](https://abcnews.go.com/US/american-airlines-issues-global-ground-stop-flights/story?id=112092372). The update was live for only 78 minutes before being reverted, but the damage was extensive, impacting various sectors including healthcare, airlines, and banking [(Cybersecurity Dive, 2024)](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/crowdstrike-flawed-update-78-minutes/722070/).\n\n### Financial Impact\nThe outage has had severe financial repercussions, particularly in the healthcare sector, which is estimated to have incurred losses of approximately $1.94 billion. Airlines, including Delta, reported losses of around $500 million due to operational disruptions [(Healthcare Innovation Group, 2024)](https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/cybersecurity/news/55132837/194b-in-expected-healthcare-losses-due-to-crowdstrike-disruption) [(BBC, 2024)](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy08ljxndr4o). Following the incident, CrowdStrike's stock price fell nearly 15% in early trading, reflecting investor concerns over the company's operational reliability [(CBS News, 2024)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/microsoft-internet-outages-reported-worldwide/).\n\n### Legal Challenges\nIn the aftermath of the outage, CrowdStrike is facing a class-action lawsuit from shareholders who allege that the company made \"false and misleading\" statements regarding its software testing processes. The lawsuit claims that the faulty update led to a significant drop in share value, amounting to a loss of $25 billion in market capitalization [(BBC, 2024)](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy08ljxndr4o).\n\n## Product Innovations\n### New Features Announced at Fal.Con 2024\nDuring the recent Fal.Con 2024 event, CrowdStrike unveiled several enhancements to its Falcon platform, including:\n- **Detection Posture Management**: This feature maps active detection rules to MITRE ATT&CK techniques, providing security teams with a comprehensive view of their detection coverage [(Fal.Con News Center, 2024)](https://www.crowdstrike.com/events/fal-con/las-vegas/news/).\n- **Enhanced Workflow Automation**: The Falcon Fusion SOAR has been upgraded to include over 300 prebuilt actions, significantly improving response times and operational efficiency [(Fal.Con News Center, 2024)](https://www.crowdstrike.com/events/fal-con/las-vegas/news/).\n- **AI Innovations**: New AI-driven capabilities, such as Charlotte AI for detection triaging and AI-generated parsers for data onboarding, were introduced to streamline operations and enhance threat detection [(Fal.Con News Center, 2024)](https://www.crowdstrike.com/events/fal-con/las-vegas/news/).\n\n## Executive Insights\nCrowdStrike's CEO, George Kurtz, has publicly addressed the outage, emphasizing the company's commitment to transparency and customer support. He stated, \"Nothing is more important to me than the trust and confidence that our customers and partners have put into CrowdStrike\" [(Falcon Content Update, 2024)](https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/). Kurtz has also committed to implementing more rigorous testing and validation processes to prevent similar incidents in the future [(ABC News, 2024)](https://abcnews.go.com/US/american-airlines-issues-global-ground-stop-flights/story?id=112092372).\n\n## Market Position and Performance\nDespite the recent challenges, CrowdStrike remains a dominant player in the cybersecurity market, with a robust annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth. The company reported a trailing twelve-month revenue of approximately $3.52 billion, with a profit margin of 4.84% [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRWD/). The stock has shown resilience over the long term, with a five-year return of 370.29%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 [(Yahoo Finance, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRWD/).\n\n## Conclusion\nCrowdStrike is navigating a critical period marked by a significant operational setback due to a software update failure. While the company has demonstrated strong growth and innovation in its product offerings, the recent outage raises questions about its operational resilience and software testing protocols. Prospective candidates and investors should closely monitor CrowdStrike's response to the incident, its legal challenges, and its ongoing commitment to enhancing its cybersecurity solutions."
