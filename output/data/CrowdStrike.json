FAQ on 2018-08-16](https://www.crowdstrike.com/products/faq/)\nDEPLOYMENT\n\nLiterally minutes â a single lightweight sensor is deployed to your endpoints as you monitor and manage your environment via a web console. With CrowdStrike FalconÂ® there are no controllers to be installed, configured, updated or maintained: there is no on-premises equipment.\n\nThe Falcon sensorâs design makes it extremely lightweight (consuming 1% or less of CPU) and unobtrusive: thereâs no UI, no pop-ups, no reboots, and all updates are performed silently and automatically.\n\nOnly these operating systems are supported for use with the Falcon sensor for Windows.

First, customers can relaunch the EC2 instance from a snapshot or image taken before 9:30 PM PDT. We have also been able to confirm that the update that caused the CrowdStrike agent issue is no longer being automatically updated. Second, the following steps can be followed to delete the file on the affected instance:  \n  \n1. Create a snapshot of the EBS root volume of the affected instance  \n2. Create a new EBS Volume from the snapshot in the same availability zone  \n3. Launch a new Windows instance in that availability zone using a similar version of Windows  \n4. Attach the EBS volume from step (2) to the new Windows instance as a data volume  \n5. Navigate to \\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\drivers\\\\CrowdStrike\\\\ folder on the attached volume and delete \"C00000291\\*.sys\"  \n6. Detach the EBS volume from the new Windows instance  \n7.

Once they make a massive error a MONTH ago and do nothing to change the testing process and then proceed to harm patients by taking down Emergency Rooms and Operating Rooms?\n\nAs a sysadmin for 35 years this is the biggest disaster to healthcare I have ever seen. The cost of recovery is astronomical. Who is going to pay for it?\n\n## Comment ID ldw2ya7 with +38 score by [(Cat_Man_Bane, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldw2ya7/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nSales teams are having a fantastic Friday night\n\nTech teams are having a long Friday night\n\n## Comment ID ldw84sy with +37 score by [(ScaffOrig, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldw84sy/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nThe entire sum of everything that Crowdstrike might ever have prevented is probably less than the damage they just caused.\n\n## Comment ID ldwd2jz with +17 score by [(HmmmAreYouSure, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldwd2jz/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nAll airlines grounded here.

It updates like six times an hour sometimes.

We run Crowdstrike provided by our enterprise. Crowdstrike pushed an update on a Friday evening that was incompatible with up-to-date Debian stable. So we patched Debian as usual, everything was fine for a week, and then all of our servers across multiple websites and cloud hosts simultaneously hard crashed and refused to boot.\n\nWhen we connected one of the disks to a new machine and checked the logs, Crowdstrike looked like a culprit, so we manually deleted it, the machine booted, tried reinstalling it and the machine immediately crashes again. OK, let's file a support ticket and get an engineer on the line.\n\nCrowdstrike took a day to respond, and then asked for a bunch more proof (beyond the above) that it was their fault. They acknowledged the bug a day later, and weeks later had a root cause analysis that they didn't cover our scenario (Debian stable running version n-1, I think, which is a supported configuration) in their test matrix. In our own post mortem there was no real ability to prevent the same thing from happening again -- \"we push software to your machines any time we want, whether or not it's urgent, without testing it\" seems to be core to the model, particularly if you're a small IT part of a large enterprise. What they're selling to the enterprise is exactly that they'll do that.\n\n## Comment ID ldyolt6 with +5 score by [(thenoodler82, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldyolt6/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nim sure this will get lost but i found a solution for people running into bitlocker problems\n\nif you are able to pxe boot you can run command prompt to execute \"bcedit /set {default} safeboot minimal\" and it will return operation completed successfully\"\nthen you reboot log in with local admin credentials and delete the offending file \"C-00000291*.sys\" and then open cmd and run \"bcedit /deletevalue {default} safeboot\" and you should be all set\n\n## Comment ID ldzl1di with +5 score by [(dat_kodiak, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldzl1di/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nI know this won't happen - but I'd like an AMA with whomever hit the button.

Obviously whatever change it was, was likely not meant to land in the root level, and someone from (speculation here) Crowdstrike’s content deployment team probably forgot a trailing slash to the actual intended directory. Which is why a simple file delete will fix it. Has anyone analyzed the actual file yet? The only thing I’ve gathered now is that the file itself is causing memory issues and Windows is freaking out and kernel panicking the OS.\n\nEither way, it’s the fix/solution that’s so absurdly time consuming especially with the need to decrypt these business endpoints in BIOS with a bit locker key before even getting into safe mode to delete said file and then reboot again, and then bit lock again. A very tiresome manual process especially with remote users, with which doing this thousands of times over will take a long time for some businesses. Seems there are some automated ways to do this, but the decryption is not so easy. And if your company has any kind of security policy (which they would) they’re not just going to allow some open source quick fix to enter their network without the highest level of vetting and approval themselves or to create their own which would require a thorough vetting process, and would take a while to get tested and approved. And remember, Microsoft says “just turn it off and on again” because maybe the end point will reach Crowdstrike’s servers on reboot forget that a HUGE amount of these affected machines are probably airgapped or offline, segregated from certain parts of the business’s network(s) for security reasons and can’t be reached like a traditional end client. Either way, I feel for all IT staff out there having to deal with this.\n\n## Comment ID ldyznd7 with +3 score by [(ShamanOty, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldyznd7/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nWhat a wonderful day we had , thank you cloud strike you just stopped our whole production in over 60 factories , im sure no one could breach into our systems today 😁 , that's an insane security level.\n\n## Comment ID ldz15m2 with +3 score by [(verismRIP, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldz15m2/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nPraying for anyone with no immediate access to Bitlocker recovery keys.

I'm lost trying to understand:  When a new version 'n' of the sensor is released, we upgrade a selected batch of machines and do some tests (mostly waiting around :-)) to see that all is well.  Then we upgrade the rest of the fleet by OU. However, 'cause we're scaredy cats, we leave some critical kit on n-1 for longer.  And some really critical kit even on n-2.  (Yeah, there's a risk in not applying patches I know but there are other outage-related risks that we balance; forget that for now)  Our assumption is that n-1, n-2, etc are old, stable releases, and so when fan and shit collided yesterday, we just hopped on the console and did a policy update to revert to n-2 and assumed we'd dodged the bullet.  But of course, that failed... you know what they say about assumptions :-)  So in a long-winded way that leads to my three questions:  Why did the 'content update'  take out not just n but n-whatever sensors equally as effectively?  Are the n-whatever versions not actually stable?  And if the n-whatever versions are not actually stable and are being patched, what's the point of the versioning?

For Windows, it installs as a Boot-Start Driver, so it must start successfully for the OS to boot up.\n\nOne feature of Falcon is to monitor named pipe executions on Windows systems. Named Pipes are a mechanism for interprocess communication in Windows that can be exploited by malicious actors.\n\n**Error**\n\nOn July 19th, Crowdstrike published a sensor configuration update that was installed automatically on millions of systems worldwide.\n\nThe update contained an erroneous file, C-00000291\\*.sys, which is a configuration file also known as a channel file.\n\nWhen the Falcon driver accesses this configuration file, it encounters a logic error and crashes. Ultimately causing the dreaded Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).\n\n**Fix**\n\nFor individual machines:\n\n1. Boot into safe mode / Windows Recovery Environment\n2. Open Terminal in Safe Mode or select it in the Windows Recovery Environment\n3. cd to %WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\drivers\\\\CrowdStrike\n4. Delete files matching regex: C-00000291\\*.sys\n5. Reboot\n\nFor servers:\n\n1. Detach OS disk volume from the impacted server\n2. Create a snapshot/backup just in case\n3. Mount the disk onto a virtual server\n4. Repeat the steps to delete the affected files like the above\n5. Reattach the disk back onto the server.\n\n### Comment ID le2zqwv with +5 score by [(According_Oil_1865, Reddit, 2024-07-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/le2zqwv/) (in reply to ID le2vh46):\nNull pointer causing crash?

How can such a thing go unnoticed in such a big security-oriented company? This shows some extensive rot inside. I don't see how the company could survive without honestly admitting its mistakes in processes and management and having an open investigation.\n\nAnd I think this is a good wake-up call for all the corps that are taking a reliable company's word on slapping a single wide-spread security product onto their infra. to solve their issues may have been a miscalculation all along. You can't trust marketing nowadays. Such a product takes a lot of control and responsibility.

From all companies I know: Every rollout will be stopped immediately if the error rate hits a certain percentage. And if 100% of the clients are offline after the update, this should be also considered as error (but maybe no one thought it could be that bad). \n\nBut even before that. For this big tech company, there should be an entire team/department checking each update goes smoothly. \n\nWild guess #1: Things are not running smoothly within the company.\n\nWild guess #2: Smells a bit like snake oil.\n\n## Comment ID ldws6cz with +2 score by [(LBEB80, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldws6cz/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\n![gif](giphy|zUwHGTclRb7W|downsized)\n\nIm in!\n\n## Comment ID ldws74x with +2 score by [(Honest-FudgeKel, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldws74x/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nGonna be a long weekend for us in Germany 🤦🏾\n\n## Comment ID ldws8sz with +2 score by [(AStrangersDream, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldws8sz/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nA few hours earlier at Crowdstrike [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya2xifdO\\_l0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya2xifdO_l0)\n\n## Comment ID ldws9kf with +2 score by [(rxtc, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldws9kf/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nYes, my whole org :'(\n\n## Comment ID ldws9xv with +2 score by [(bradklyn, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldws9xv/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nYou either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain.\n\n## Comment ID ldwsd1y with +2 score by [(5370616e69617264, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1e6vmkf/bsod_error_in_latest_crowdstrike_update/ldwsd1y/) (in reply to ID 1e6vmkf):\nThere are healthcare and emergency services not working right now.

We are an M365 E3 licensed org with the E5 security suite added on for users.  There is a lot of integration with MS across the solution stack, however from a management side we do not have dedicated security people that can stay on top of everything.  Yes, it is working and online, but if something major were to happen we would be looking for resources and support needs very quickly.  This is why a possible managed CS solution has been talked about. \n\nTechnically, we would still have several MS security items in place and Defender would still be online, just taking a backseat if you will to CS that is installed on workstation's and servers.\n\nI wanted to see if there is anyone that currently has a Defender solution in place and then went with CS?  If yes, what was the reason and how has it been?  If no, what was the reason?\n\nI am not sure on what the cost structure of something like this would look like, and it might not be possible, but I am gathering information and wanted to hear what others have done in this situation.\n\nThank you and I welcome any feedback or thoughts you have!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Comment ID ksqk8sc with +27 score by [(OK_SmellYaLater, Reddit, 2024-02-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1b35fbs/crowdstrike_vs_ms_defender/ksqk8sc/) (in reply to ID 1b35fbs):\nWe have run the CrowdStrike Falcon Complete on 4500 hosts for 3.5 years and are very happy with the service. Users and endpoints are a huge risk to the organization, so our selection process didn't include the option for Microsoft Defender only because we prefer a defense in depth approach with multiple layers. While Microsoft can cover all of the bases, they don't really do anything great and we don't like the thought of Microsoft \"grading their own homework\" so to speak. This is why we have added additional layers or outsourced security aspects to other vendors and 3rd parties when possible, like using Avanan for email security and Rapid7 instead of Sentinel etc.  \n\nCrowdStrike Falcon Complete is kick ass. It might be cost prohibitive if you are under 300 licenses, but the cost is absolutely worth it if you can pull it off. In the last 3+ years they have stopped 2 ransomware attacks and remediated other significant infections with very little effort on our side, if any. Their incident response team is great and have been helpful with information and assistance on incidents that weren't related to endpoints/crowdstrike. Support is amazing.

If you're like us and have a bunch of servers in Azure running Crowdstrike, the past 8 hours have probably SUCKED for you! The only guidance is to boot in safe mode, but how the heck do you do that on an Azure VM??\n\nI wanted to quickly share what worked for us:\n\n1) Make a clone of your OS disk. Snapshot --> create a new disk from it, create a new disk directly with the old disk as source, whatever your preferred workflow is\n\n2) Attach the cloned OS disk to a functional server as a data disk\n\n3) Open disk management (create and format hard disk partitions), find the new disk, right click, \"online\"\n\n4) Check the letters of the disk partitions: both system reserved and windows\n\n5) Navigate to the staged disk's Windows drive, deal with the Crowdstrike files. Either rename the Crowdstrike folder at Windows\\System32\\drivers\\Crowdstrike as Crowdstrike.bak or similar, delete the the file matching “C-00000291*.sys”, per Crowdstrike's instructions, whatever\n\nFrom here, we found that if we replaced the disk on the server, we would get a winload.exe boot manager error instead! Don't dismount your disk, we aren't done yet!\n\n6) Pull up this MS Learn doc: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/windows/error-code-0xc000000e\n\n7) Follow the instructions in the document to run bcdedit repairs on your boot directory. So in our case, that meant the following -- replace F: and H: with the appropriate drive letters.

Login to Azure console --> Go to Virtual Machines --> Select the VM\n2. Upper left on console --> Click : \"Connect\" --> Click --> Connect --> Click \"More ways to Connect\"  --> Click : \"Serial Console\"\n3. Step 3 : Once SAC has loaded, type in 'cmd' and press enter.\n   1. type in 'cmd' command\n   2. type in : ch -si 1\n4. Press any key (space bar). Enter Administrator credentials\n5.

Hovever microsoft updated their KB on [https://azure.status.microsoft/en-gb/status](https://azure.status.microsoft/en-gb/status) Copy of the MS KB below, **The TLDR - do many VM reboots (up to 15!)**\n\n## \n\nWe have been made aware of an issue impacting Virtual Machines running Windows Client and Windows Server, running the CrowdStrike Falcon agent, which may encounter a bug check (BSOD) and get stuck in a restarting state. We approximate impact started around 19:00 UTC on the 18th of July.\n\nAdditional details from CrowdStrike are available here: [Statement on Windows Sensor Update - crowdstrike.com](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-windows-sensor-update/)\n\n**Update as of 10:30 UTC on 19 July 2024:**\n\nWe have received reports of successful recovery from some customers attempting multiple Virtual Machine restart operations on affected Virtual Machines. Customers can attempt to do so as follows:\n\n* Using the Azure Portal - attempting 'Restart' on affected VMs\n* Using the Azure CLI or Azure Shell ([https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com/))\n\n\n\nWe've received feedback from customers that several reboots (as many as 15 have been reported) may be required, but overall feedback is that reboots are an effective troubleshooting step at this stage.\n\n**Additional options for recovery:**\n\nWe recommend customers that are able to, to restore from a backup from before 19:00 UTC on the 18th of July.\n\n* Customers leveraging Azure Backup can follow the following instructions:\n\n[How to restore Azure VM data in Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms)\n\n* Alternatively, customers can attempt to repair the OS disk offline by following these instructions: \n\n[Attach an unmanaged disk to a VM for offline repair](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/windows/unmanaged-disk-offline-repair)\n\n* Disks that are encrypted may need these additional instructions:\n\n[Unlocking an encrypted disk for offline repair](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/windows/unlock-encrypted-disk-offline)\n\nOnce the disk is attached, customers can attempt to delete the following file. \n\nWindows/System/System32/Drivers/CrowdStrike/C00000291\\*.sys\n\nThe disk can then be attached and re-attached to the original VM.\n\nWe can confirm the affected update has been pulled by CrowdStrike. Customers that are continuing to experience issues should reach out to CrowdStrike for additional assistance.\n\nAdditionally, we're continuing to investigate additional mitigation options for customers and will share more information as it becomes known.\n\nThis message was last updated at 11:36 UTC on 19 July 2024\n\n#### Comment ID ldxcsrh with +2 score by [(manvscar, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/1e70rdw/psa_repairing_the_crowdstrike_bsod_on_azurehosted/ldxcsrh/) (in reply to ID ldx6srr):\nI noticed that my VM's do actually respond to ping for a couple seconds until they BSOD and restart again.

In august 2016 they upgraded the package and the package was corrupt making many systems to crash. Glibc is a critical component in a Linux system.

EDR stands for Endpoint Detection & Response, in layman's terms, EDR is an antivirus on steroids. \n\nEDRs can detect malware using behavior analysis which is based on function calls, filesystem events, network connection and more. Additionally, they can also be centrally managed and automated, so that it can automatically block malicious processes, delete malicious files, lock compromised users etc. \n\nHowever, to do that, the agents need to be loaded as a kernel module (this is the case for Windows, Mac and also Linux), which means that if the agent is faulty, then you may get a BSOD or a kernel panic. Which is what happened in this case, CrowdStrike pushed an update which was faulty, resulting in a lot of BSOD for the Windows users (Mac and Linux agents didn't have a problem with the update).\n\nNow, the fun part is that Microsoft uses CrowdStrike as an EDR for their servers, which resulted in this shitstorm.   \n\nThe way I see it, this could easily happen to Linux or Mac too.\n\nAs a sidenote, Microsoft has its own EDR, Defender for Endpoint, which also supports Linux and Mac through Sentinel One, which is another leading EDR, but they chose to use CrowdStrike for Microsoft's Infrastructure.\n\n### Comment ID ldz42mk with +8 score by [(barkappara, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1e72ovd/has_something_as_catastrophic_as_crowdstrike_ever/ldz42mk/) (in reply to ID ldxsb11):\n> Now, the fun part is that Microsoft uses CrowdStrike as an EDR for their servers, which resulted in this shitstorm. \n\nAIUI Microsoft is claiming that the Azure outage was unrelated to CrowdStrike: [incident report 1K80-N_8](https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status/history/) says the root cause was a bad configuration change.

There was a memory leak in gdi+ some years ago that was pretty bad. Gitlab having a hole that required you effectively reinstall the whole machine. Holes in docker, kvm, k8 and Chef. The composer thing from years past. NPM, PPA, nuget all seeing malicious packages going out much like XZ in recent memory.\n\nThe reason for those not being as big was because people acted quickly or machines were not rolled out onto the bad stuff just yet. Linux is much more fragmented ecosystem with its distros and each org sysadmin having their own ideas on when and what to update. There are also usually more options for if I don't want to trust the idiots at Cloudflare with critical things I can get the same stuff from 3 other vendors. The fragmentation also makes it more difficult to write something universally bad unless you want to go through the hoops of gaining the trust of the maintainers of things like openssl or something similar, which is going to only get harder with the way the current climate is moving.\n\nLessons are being learned regardless and that's always a good thing. It would be better if logic was applied in the first place to prevent those things, but money talks. So long as M$ is willing to spend the money and no one fines them big time for their behavior and screw ups nothing will really change. Linux has, in that respect at least, less money directly involved that would be driving poor practices. Not saying that's not the case at all, because it absolutely is, but there is a lot more force behind building a secure platform simply to be able to gloat rather than get rich.

You'd think that the lower market penetration could limit the damage but that is not true for the server and supercomputing space. Linux dominates servers with approx. 70% market share and super computers with 100% (i.e. all of them) of the Top-500. \n\nHowever, Linux is much more diversified than windows. Each company/community has its own policies and subsystems. Even when they use the same subsystems, they are likely to have different versions installed. \n\nTherefore, in theory, your own Linux system may have similar probabilities to fail as a windows system (OK, perhaps much lower for other reasons but this is not the subject here), however, it is unlikely for multiple systems to fail on this scale. \n\nAs for your edit, windows is not bad due to being insecure (they've come a long way the last decade).

But I have no idea how I go about doing that.  \n\nJust to give you an example of why I want to learn the CS API, I'd like to do something similar to how I use Excel to 'get data' from various sources like Active Directory, Exchange Server, SQL Server, text & csv files, etc.  I typically pull that data from those sources into an Excel worksheet and then sort, filter, and compare data with other data sources.  For example, I will query Active Directory for 'all computers' and query 'SolarWinds Server & Application Monitor' for all 'nodes' and have it show me all computers in AD that are not in SW SAM.  This allows me to figure out why we might not be monitoring all our computers with SW.  I could see the same application here: \"show me all computers in AD that are not in CS\".  I figured using the API was the quickest method (i'd rather not have to export the hosts file to CSV every time I wanted to run this query).\n\n## Comment ID h9xa6om with +12 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/p9egth/crowdstrike_api_for_dummies/h9xa6om/) (in reply to ID p9egth):\nThis video from Fal.Con last year helped me get started using the APIs CrowdStrike offers.

The [Asset Inventory](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/discover/discover/en-US/app/eam2/discover__asset_inventory) within Falcon Discover can be used to find devices on local subnets without the Falcon Sensor, and pulling data from there might be easier than creating your own integration.\n2. Falcon Complete reviews this data and can notify you when they think you're lacking in sensor coverage.\n\nThere are a few different resources that can help you learn how to use the APIs. The [Falcon OAuth2 API Documentation](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/documentation/46/crowdstrike-oauth2-based-apis) is the first place to go to understand what the OAuth2 APIs are. It provides links to specific APIs, examples of authentication, etc.\n\n[PSFalcon](https://github.com/crowdstrike/psfalcon) makes these APIs easier to use with PowerShell, while [falconpy](https://github.com/crowdstrike/falconpy) and [gofalcon](https://github.com/crowdstrike/gofalcon) make them easier to use with Python and Golang, respectively. If you're completely new to APIs but understand one of these languages, one of these tools will be the best place to start. If you'd like to pull this data directly with Excel, you're going to have to start from scratch, or figure out how you could use Excel to call one of these tools to get your data.\n\nPersonally, I think your easiest route would be to pull data with PSFalcon to CSV and then compare, which leads to the next question -- how do you get specific data? You'll need to understand what APIs are available, test each one and see if it contains what you want. Within PSFalcon, if you're trying to get information about devices, that's `Get-FalconHost`.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>show me all computers in AD that are not in CS\n\nI can think of a couple ways to tackle this. First, you can pull relevant device information, save it to CSV and compare it against your list from AD. The downside with this approach is that it's inefficient to pull this data every time you want it, because a lot of it probably won't change too often.\n\n    Get-FalconHost -Detailed -All | Select-Object device_id, hostname, last_seen, mac_address, local_ip, machine_domain, ou, site_name | Export-FalconReport -Path .\\Hosts.csv\n\nOr, you can pull relevant device information, save locally to a database, and compare on demand using Excel. This is a bit more complicated because you'd need to add in a way for PSFalcon to output it's data directly to a database (maybe a module like [dbatools](https://dbatools.io/)), but you could create a scheduled task to pull device data and update the database with changes.\n\nHere's a query that would pull all devices that have connected to the cloud in the last 24 hours (which could presumably have new data):\n\n    Get-FalconHost -Filter \"last_seen:>'now-24h'\" -Detailed\n\n## Comment ID h9xionr with +3 score by [(niemesrw, Reddit, 2021-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/p9egth/crowdstrike_api_for_dummies/h9xionr/) (in reply to ID p9egth):\nHighly recommend using powershell if you can.

Best of luck!\n\n## Comment ID jmqjzwy with +1 score by [(ThenSession, Reddit, 2023-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/13yyxqp/sensor_installed_but_not_connected/jmqjzwy/) (in reply to ID 13yyxqp):\nFirewalls.\n\n## Comment ID jmqrj7g with +1 score by [(iagelo, Reddit, 2023-06-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/13yyxqp/sensor_installed_but_not_connected/jmqrj7g/) (in reply to ID 13yyxqp):\nInteresting topic, is therea way to tell the installer to dont clean up the installation if it don't reach the tenant? It will be usefull for offline/template installations, thx!\n\n### Comment ID jn0h9fv with +1 score by [(Nguyendot, Reddit, 2023-06-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/13yyxqp/sensor_installed_but_not_connected/jn0h9fv/) (in reply to ID jmqrj7g):\nYou would use the VDI or VM Template options detailed in the documentation.\n\nNORESTART=1 or VDI=1, basically it tells it to install and not check in until the next reboot. It avoids duplicates as well. Review the docs for full info on how to use it and the considerations necessary.",
      "# Post ID 1cluxzz: Crowdstrike Kernel panic RHEL 9.4 with +45 score by [(loitho, Reddit, 2024-05-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1cluxzz/crowdstrike_kernel_panic_rhel_94/)\nHi there,\n\nFollowing the upgrade from RHEL 9.3 to RHEL 9.4 on our VMware Virtual machines, we noticed that after a few minutes, those machine were kernel panicking and logging a \"The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system\" on VMware side.\n\nI was quite surprised to see that this was due to CS agent no being yet compatible with RHEL 9.4 and its new kernel. \n\nWhat's the usual release cycle for CS and compatibility with RHEL *minor* versions ? As the beta for 9.4 has been out for more than a month I (wrongly) assumed that the agent would be compatible :( \n\nKind regards\n\n## Comment ID l2w5uhm with +9 score by [(Staranorra, Reddit, 2024-05-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1cluxzz/crowdstrike_kernel_panic_rhel_94/l2w5uhm/) (in reply to ID 1cluxzz):\nIf I remember correctly there was a tech alert related to this stating that the problem was (or is) a bug in the Linux kernel and not in the CS agent itself.\n\n### Comment ID l2wh5pb with +3 score by [(loitho, Reddit, 2024-05-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1cluxzz/crowdstrike_kernel_panic_rhel_94/l2wh5pb/) (in reply to ID l2w5uhm):\nHi,\n\nThank you for your reply, I've been reading a bit on the CS documentation, I didn't find the Tech Alert you're talking about sadly, but you mean that because there is a bug with the Kernel, the CS agent isn't able to switch from Kernel mode to User Mode or at least RFM ?\n\n#### Comment ID l2yb9r8 with +4 score by [(Staranorra, Reddit, 2024-05-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/1cluxzz/crowdstrike_kernel_panic_rhel_94/l2yb9r8/) (in reply to ID l2wh5pb):\nThe support portal is a great resource for information and you can also subscribe alerts/notifications based on your own product stack.

They serve two masters: we need to fulfill our mission and keep our customers safe, but also continue to grow as fast as we can, and while our customers and Wall Street frequently overlap in what they want and need, sometimes those goals don't always align. Depending on who you ask, there are a lot of focus areas and a ton of priorities. 5 year plans. Speeches at quarterly All hands. Corporate and team goals, and it gets dizzying. The message is often unclear. - I haven't been here forever, but while CrowdStrike has a ton of great people, it's filled with more than its fair share of \"rest and vest\" pre-IPO veterans who like to sit and complain about the good ol' days, even though they don't seem to produce much at all. - To the point above, while I haven't been here forever, in the years I've been here what I have seen is a leadership pullback. As the company's grown, there have been more unannounced re-orgs, execs leaving, and this and that happening with little or reactive communication, which leaves everyone wondering what's up and looking over their shoulder. Corporate comms needs to be re-done with a much clearer focus on transparency. - There is little to no training for managers, and managers aren't evaluated at all on how good they actually are as managers, so it's kind of a roll of the dice in terms of how effective your manager is and how they'll advocate for you. - Related to the above, I cannot explain to you how and why some people get promoted and others don't. There is no track or defined process, so it's very much up in the air behind a secretive and often delayed annual merit cycle. A lot of people were frustrated this year. - Speaking of, merit raises haven't been great lately. If I end up leaving, that will be why.

Outside of a survey once or twice a year that doesn't seem to be looked at by anyone with the power to do anything, it seems that a lot of this falls on deaf ears.",
        "cons": "When I was writing this out there were more things than I initially thought, but here goes: - I understand the pressure that leadership is under. They serve two masters: we need to fulfill our mission and keep our customers safe, but also continue to grow as fast as we can, and while our customers and Wall Street frequently overlap in what they want and need, sometimes those goals don't always align. Depending on who you ask, there are a lot of focus areas and a ton of priorities. 5 year plans. Speeches at quarterly All hands. Corporate and team goals, and it gets dizzying. The message is often unclear. - I haven't been here forever, but while CrowdStrike has a ton of great people, it's filled with more than its fair share of \"rest and vest\" pre-IPO veterans who like to sit and complain about the good ol' days, even though they don't seem to produce much at all. - To the point above, while I haven't been here forever, in the years I've been here what I have seen is a leadership pullback. As the company's grown, there have been more unannounced re-orgs, execs leaving, and this and that happening with little or reactive communication, which leaves everyone wondering what's up and looking over their shoulder. Corporate comms needs to be re-done with a much clearer focus on transparency. - There is little to no training for managers, and managers aren't evaluated at all on how good they actually are as managers, so it's kind of a roll of the dice in terms of how effective your manager is and how they'll advocate for you. - Related to the above, I cannot explain to you how and why some people get promoted and others don't. There is no track or defined process, so it's very much up in the air behind a secretive and often delayed annual merit cycle. A lot of people were frustrated this year. - Speaking of, merit raises haven't been great lately. If I end up leaving, that will be why. Please give your top performers an incentive to stay! - There's no educational reimbursement at all. - 401k is embarrassingly bad for a company of our size with the revenue we generate.",

This is my first company where I'm never bothered on the weekends or after hours. - Overall, the future is bright! - This is going to sound Kool-aidy, but it's the best cybersecurity company in the industry.

      "# [Technical Details: Falcon Update for Windows Hosts on 2024-09-21](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/falcon-update-for-windows-hosts-technical-details/)\nWhat Happened?\n\nOn July 19, 2024 at 04:09 UTC, as part of ongoing operations, CrowdStrike released a sensor configuration update to Windows systems. Sensor configuration updates are an ongoing part of the protection mechanisms of the Falcon platform. This configuration update triggered a logic error resulting in a system crash and blue screen (BSOD) on impacted systems.\n\nThe sensor configuration update that caused the system crash was remediated on Friday, July 19, 2024 05:27 UTC.\n\nThis issue is not the result of or related to a cyberattack.\n\nImpact\n\nCustomers running Falcon sensor for Windows version 7.11 and above, that were online between Friday, July 19, 2024 04:09 UTC and Friday, July 19, 2024 05:27 UTC, may be impacted.\n\nSystems running Falcon sensor for Windows 7.11 and above that downloaded the updated configuration from 04:09 UTC to 05:27 UTC – were susceptible to a system crash.\n\nConfiguration File Primer\n\nThe configuration files mentioned above are referred to as “Channel Files” and are part of the behavioral protection mechanisms used by the Falcon sensor. Updates to Channel Files are a normal part of the sensor’s operation and occur several times a day in response to novel tactics, techniques, and procedures discovered by CrowdStrike. This is not a new process; the architecture has been in place since Falcon’s inception.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nOn Windows systems, Channel Files reside in the following directory:\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\CrowdStrike\\\n\nand have a file name that starts with “C-”. Each channel file is assigned a number as a unique identifier. The impacted Channel File in this event is 291 and will have a filename that starts with “C-00000291-” and ends with a .sys extension. Although Channel Files end with the SYS extension, they are not kernel drivers.\n\nChannel File 291 controls how Falcon evaluates named pipe1 execution on Windows systems. Named pipes are used for normal, interprocess or intersystem communication in Windows.\n\nThe update that occurred at 04:09 UTC was designed to target newly observed, malicious named pipes being used by common C2 frameworks in cyberattacks. The configuration update triggered a logic error that resulted in an operating system crash.\n\nChannel File 291\n\nCrowdStrike has corrected the logic error by updating the content in Channel File 291. No additional changes to Channel File 291 beyond the updated logic will be deployed. Falcon is still evaluating and protecting against the abuse of named pipes.\n\nThis is not related to null bytes contained within Channel File 291 or any other Channel File.\n\nRemediation\n\nThe most up-to-date remediation recommendations and information can be found on our blog or in the Support Portal.\n\nWe understand that some customers may have specific support needs and we ask them to contact us directly.\n\nSystems that are not currently impacted will continue to operate as expected, continue to provide protection, and have no risk of experiencing this event in the future.\n\nSystems running Linux or macOS do not use Channel File 291 and were not impacted.\n\nRoot Cause Analysis\n\nWe understand how this issue occurred and we are doing a thorough root cause analysis to determine how this logic flaw occurred. This effort will be ongoing. We are committed to identifying any foundational or workflow improvements that we can make to strengthen our process. We will update our findings in the root cause analysis as the investigation progresses.",

      "# [CrowdStrike Falcon Issue ‘Fix Has Been Deployed;’ Microsoft Identifies ‘Root Cause’ Of Outage by Mark Haranas](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2024/crowdstrike-falcon-issue-fix-has-been-deployed-microsoft-identifies-root-cause-of-outage)\nThe massive Microsoft Azure and CrowdStrike outage reportedly was caused by a recent update to CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor software. Here’s where everything stands as of Friday morning.\n\nFrom emergency 911 call centers to national health-care services to the largest airlines, the Microsoft Azure and CrowdStrike outage is causing chaos around the world.\n\nAs of Friday morning, CrowdStrike said, “The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.”\n\nThe outage stemmed from a recent update to CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor software, according to Microsoft, which affected Windows 365 Cloud PCs.\n\n[RELATED: 5 Things To Know On The CrowdStrike-Microsoft Outage]\n\nCrowdStrike said it is working with “customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts. Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted. This is not a security incident or cyberattack.”\n\nThe outage reportedly first began Thursday when some Microsoft clients in the U.S., such as airlines, were hit with an outage on their Azure cloud services system.\n\nMicrosoft is urging customers affected to conduct point-in-time restore for Windows 365 Business and Enterprise. Point-in-time restore enables end users to restore a Cloud PC to the exact state it was at an earlier point in time, said Microsoft in a blog post.\n\n“To fix this, users may restore their Windows 365 Cloud PC to a known good state prior to the release of the update (July 19, 2024),” Microsoft said on X. “Windows 365 Business admins can also restore Cloud PCs to an earlier state on behalf of their users,” the company said. “Short-term restore points are saved every 12 hours.”\n\nMicrosoft Identifies Preliminary Root Cause For 365 Admin Center, Teams\n\nThe outage is still affecting many Microsoft 365 users who may still be unable to access various 365 applications and services as of Friday morning, including Teams.\n\nMicrosoft said the “preliminary root cause” was a configuration change in a portion of its Azure back-end workloads that “caused interruption between storage and compute resources, which resulted in connectivity failures that affected downstream Microsoft 365 services dependent on these connections.”\n\nMicrosoft Teams users may still be unable to leverage Microsoft Teams functions including presence, group chats and user registration. “Microsoft 365 admins may be intermittently unable to access the Microsoft 365 admin center and any action may be delayed if accessible,” the company said.\n\nMicrosoft is continuing to apply mitigation actions to provide relief from the impact affecting the remaining Microsoft 365 apps and services.\n\n“Our telemetry is indicating that the remaining impacted scenarios are progressing towards a full recovery and we’re closely monitoring to ensure this progress continues,” Microsoft said.\n\nCrowdStrike CEO Kurtz provided a statement on X Friday regarding the issue.\n\nHe said his Austin, Texas-based cybersecurity firm is working with customers impacted by the update that affected Windows hosts. Kurtz reiterated that the issue was not a “security incident or cyberattack.”\n\n“We further recommend organizations ensure they’re communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels,” Kurtz said. “Our team is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers.”\n\nMicrosoft Azure ‘Reboots’ Are Working\n\nFor Microsoft Azure, there are still service issues impacting virtual machines running Windows Client and Windows Server that are running the CrowdStrike Falcon agent, which may encounter a bug check (BSOD) and agent stuck in a restarting state.\n\n“We have received reports of successful recovery from some customers attempting multiple Virtual Machine restart operations on affected Virtual Machines,” Microsoft said. “We’ve received feedback from customers that several reboots (as many as 15 have been reported) may be required, but overall feedback is that reboots are an effective troubleshooting step at this stage.”\n\nCrowdStrike is referring customers to its support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide updates on its website.\n\n“We further recommend organizations ensure they’re communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels,” CrowdStrike said. “Our team is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers.”\n\nCustomers first began reporting issues through the Down Detector website, which data shows hit a peak at around 3 a.m. ET.",
      "# [Falcon Content Update Preliminary Post Incident Report on 2024-09-21](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/falcon-content-update-preliminary-post-incident-report/)\nUpdated 2024-07-25 1900 UTC\n\nExecutive Summary PDF\n\nThis is CrowdStrike’s preliminary Post Incident Review (PIR). We will be detailing our full investigation in the forthcoming Root Cause Analysis that will be released publicly. Throughout this PIR, we have used generalized terminology to describe the Falcon platform for improved readability. Terminology in other documentation may be more specific and technical.\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nOn Friday, July 19, 2024 at 04:09 UTC, as part of regular operations, CrowdStrike released a content configuration update for the Windows sensor to gather telemetry on possible novel threat techniques.\n\nThese updates are a regular part of the dynamic protection mechanisms of the Falcon platform. The problematic Rapid Response Content configuration update resulted in a Windows system crash.\n\nSystems in scope include Windows hosts running sensor version 7.11 and above that were online between Friday, July 19, 2024 04:09 UTC and Friday, July 19, 2024 05:27 UTC and received the update. Mac and Linux hosts were not impacted.\n\nThe defect in the content update was reverted on Friday, July 19, 2024 at 05:27 UTC. Systems coming online after this time, or that did not connect during the window, were not impacted.\n\nWhat Went Wrong and Why?\n\nCrowdStrike delivers security content configuration updates to our sensors in two ways: Sensor Content that is shipped with our sensor directly, and Rapid Response Content that is designed to respond to the changing threat landscape at operational speed.\n\nThe issue on Friday involved a Rapid Response Content update with an undetected error.\n\nSensor Content\n\nSensor Content provides a wide range of capabilities to assist in adversary response. It is always part of a sensor release and not dynamically updated from the cloud. Sensor Content includes on-sensor AI and machine learning models, and comprises code written expressly to deliver longer-term, reusable capabilities for CrowdStrike’s threat detection engineers.\n\nThese capabilities include Template Types, which have pre-defined fields for threat detection engineers to leverage in Rapid Response Content. Template Types are expressed in code. All Sensor Content, including Template Types, go through an extensive QA process, which includes automated testing, manual testing, validation and rollout steps.\n\nThe sensor release process begins with automated testing, both prior to and after merging into our code base. This includes unit testing, integration testing, performance testing and stress testing. This culminates in a staged sensor rollout process that starts with dogfooding internally at CrowdStrike, followed by early adopters. It is then made generally available to customers. Customers then have the option of selecting which parts of their fleet should install the latest sensor release (‘N’), or one version older (‘N-1’) or two versions older (‘N-2’) through Sensor Update Policies.\n\nThe event of Friday, July 19, 2024 was not triggered by Sensor Content, which is only delivered with the release of an updated Falcon sensor. Customers have complete control over the deployment of the sensor — which includes Sensor Content and Template Types.\n\nRapid Response Content\n\nRapid Response Content is used to perform a variety of behavioral pattern-matching operations on the sensor using a highly optimized engine. Rapid Response Content is a representation of fields and values, with associated filtering. This Rapid Response Content is stored in a proprietary binary file that contains configuration data. It is not code or a kernel driver.\n\nRapid Response Content is delivered as “Template Instances,” which are instantiations of a given Template Type. Each Template Instance maps to specific behaviors for the sensor to observe, detect or prevent. Template Instances have a set of fields that can be configured to match the desired behavior.\n\nIn other words, Template Types represent a sensor capability that enables new telemetry and detection, and their runtime behavior is configured dynamically by the Template Instance (i.e., Rapid Response Content).\n\nRapid Response Content provides visibility and detections on the sensor without requiring sensor code changes. This capability is used by threat detection engineers to gather telemetry, identify indicators of adversary behavior and perform detections and preventions. Rapid Response Content is behavioral heuristics, separate and distinct from CrowdStrike’s on-sensor AI prevention and detection capabilities.\n\nRapid Response Content Testing and Deployment\n\nRapid Response Content is delivered as content configuration updates to the Falcon sensor. There are three primary systems: the Content Configuration System, the Content Interpreter and the Sensor Detection Engine.\n\nThe Content Configuration System is part of the Falcon platform in the cloud, while the Content Interpreter and Sensor Detection Engine are components of the Falcon sensor. The Content Configuration System is used to create Template Instances, which are validated and deployed to the sensor through a mechanism called Channel Files. The sensor stores and updates its content configuration data through Channel Files, which are written to disk on the host.\n\nThe Content Interpreter on the sensor reads the Channel File and interprets the Rapid Response Content, enabling the Sensor Detection Engine to observe, detect or prevent malicious activity, depending on the customer’s policy configuration. The Content Interpreter is designed to gracefully handle exceptions from potentially problematic content.\n\nNewly released Template Types are stress tested across many aspects, such as resource utilization, system performance impact and event volume. For each Template Type, a specific Template Instance is used to stress test the Template Type by matching against any possible value of the associated data fields to identify adverse system interactions.\n\nTemplate Instances are created and configured through the use of the Content Configuration System, which includes the Content Validator that performs validation checks on the content before it is published.\n\nTimeline of Events: Testing and Rollout of the InterProcessCommunication (IPC) Template Type\n\nSensor Content Release: On February 28, 2024, sensor 7.11 was made generally available to customers, introducing a new IPC Template Type to detect novel attack techniques that abuse Named Pipes. This release followed all Sensor Content testing procedures outlined above in the Sensor Content section.\n\nTemplate Type Stress Testing: On March 05, 2024, a stress test of the IPC Template Type was executed in our staging environment, which consists of a variety of operating systems and workloads. The IPC Template Type passed the stress test and was validated for use.\n\nTemplate Instance Release via Channel File 291: On March 05, 2024, following the successful stress test, an IPC Template Instance was released to production as part of a content configuration update. Subsequently, three additional IPC Template Instances were deployed between April 8, 2024 and April 24, 2024. These Template Instances performed as expected in production.\n\nWhat Happened on July 19, 2024?\n\nOn July 19, 2024, two additional IPC Template Instances were deployed. Due to a bug in the Content Validator, one of the two Template Instances passed validation despite containing problematic content data.\n\nBased on the testing performed before the initial deployment of the Template Type (on March 05, 2024), trust in the checks performed in the Content Validator, and previous successful IPC Template Instance deployments, these instances were deployed into production.\n\nWhen received by the sensor and loaded into the Content Interpreter, problematic content in Channel File 291 resulted in an out-of-bounds memory read triggering an exception. This unexpected exception could not be gracefully handled, resulting in a Windows operating system crash (BSOD).\n\nHow Do We Prevent This From Happening Again?\n\nSoftware Resiliency and Testing\n\nImprove Rapid Response Content testing by using testing types such as:\n\nLocal developer testing\n\nContent update and rollback testing\n\nStress testing, fuzzing and fault injection\n\nStability testing\n\nContent interface testing\n\nAdd additional validation checks to the Content Validator for Rapid Response Content. A new check is in process to guard against this type of problematic content from being deployed in the future.\n\nEnhance existing error handling in the Content Interpreter.\n\nRapid Response Content Deployment\n\nImplement a staggered deployment strategy for Rapid Response Content in which updates are gradually deployed to larger portions of the sensor base, starting with a canary deployment.\n\nImprove monitoring for both sensor and system performance, collecting feedback during Rapid Response Content deployment to guide a phased rollout.\n\nProvide customers with greater control over the delivery of Rapid Response Content updates by allowing granular selection of when and where these updates are deployed.\n\nProvide content update details via release notes, which customers can subscribe to.\n\nThird Party Validation\n\nConduct multiple independent third-party security code reviews.\n\nConduct independent reviews of end-to-end quality processes from development through deployment.",

      "# [A massive tech outage is causing worldwide disruptions. Here’s what we know on 2024-07-19](https://apnews.com/article/what-is-crowdstrike-worldwide-outage-94b4fc5ac6eed46ddcd565a5f1e4b916)\nNEW YORK (AP) — Much of the world faced online disarray Friday as a widespread technology outage affected companies and services across industries — grounding flights, knocking banks and hospital systems offline and media outlets off air.\n\nAt the heart of the massive disruption is CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that provides software to scores of companies worldwide. The company says the problem occurred when it deployed a faulty update to computers running Microsoft Windows, noting that the issue behind the outage was not a security incident or cyberattack.\n\nCrowdStrike has said a fix is on the way. Still, chaos deepened hours after the problem was first detected.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nHow did Friday’s ‘blue screen’ outage emerge?\n\nFriday’s disruptions began when a faulty update was pushed out from CrowdStrike for one of its tools, “Falcon.” In a statement about the ongoing situation, the company said the defect was found “in a single content update for Windows hosts” — noting that Mac and Linux systems were not impacted.\n\nBut, because scores of companies rely on CrowdStrike for their security needs with Windows as their operating system, the consequences of this kind of technical problem have been far-reaching. As a result, affected computer after computer showed the “blue screen of death” error message.\n\nLong lines formed at airports in the U.S., Europe and Asia as airlines lost access to check-in and booking services during peak summer travel — disrupting thousands of flights. Banks in South Africa and New Zealand reported outages impacting payments. Some news stations, particularly in Australia, were unable to broadcast for hours. And hospitals had problems with their appointment systems, leading to delays and sometimes cancelations for critical care, while officials in some U.S. states warned of 911 problems in their areas.\n\nElsewhere, people experienced more minor inconveniences, including trouble ordering ahead at Starbucks, causing long lines at some of the coffee chain’s stores. Some billboards in New York City’s famous Times Square also went dark.\n\nExperts stress that Friday’s disruptions underscore the vulnerability of worldwide dependence on software that comes from only a handful of providers.\n\n“It is an ‘all our eggs are in one basket’ situation,” Craig Shue, professor and computer science department head at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, said in emailed commentary. “This lets us make sure our ‘basket’ is high quality: the software provider tries to identify threats and respond to them quickly. But at the same time, if anything goes wrong and the basket fails, we have a lot of broken eggs.”\n\nWhat is CrowdStrike?\n\nCrowdStrike is a U.S. cybersecurity company that provides software to companies around the world and across industries. It bills itself as being the globe’s most advanced cloud-based security technology provider.\n\n“We stop breaches,” the cybersecurity company says on its website.\n\nAccording to its website, CrowdStrike was founded in 2011 and launched in early 2012. It listed on the Nasdaq exchange five years ago. Last month, the Austin, Texas, company reported that its revenue rose 33% in the latest quarter from the same quarter a year earlier — logging a net profit of $42.8 million, up from $491,000 in the first quarter of last year. It reported having 29,000 subscribing customers.\n\nCrowdStrike has a partnership with Amazon Web Services and its “Falcon for Defender” security technology is designed to supplement Microsoft Defender to prevent attacks.\n\nIs there a fix?\n\nDisruptions on Friday continued hours after CrowdStrike first identified the issue. But both the company and Microsoft said that they’re working to get systems back online.\n\nIn an emailed statement, CrowdStrike said that it was “actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts” — adding that a fix “had been deployed” for the identified issue.\n\nCrowdStrike President and CEO George Kurtz later apologized. “We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,” he wrote on social media platform X.\n\nMicrosoft spokesperson Frank X. Shaw said that the company was “actively supporting customers to assist in their recovery.” Both CrowdStrike and Microsoft are also appearing to engage IT personnel on official online channels, such as Reddit.\n\nWhile the problem is fixable, it requires some expertise — and its impacts could last long past Friday, with Kurtz noting earlier that some customers may need a “manual” fix. Cybersecurity experts also warn of bad actors who may reach out claiming they can help. Smaller companies or organizations with less IT resources are particularly at risk.\n\nGartner analyst Eric Grenier noted that those affected should make sure they’re talking to trusted organizations as they work towards recovery. “Attackers will definitely prey on organizations as a result of this,” he said.",
      "# [Likely eCrime Actor Capitalizing on Falcon Sensor Issues by Counter Adversary Operations on 2024-09-21](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/likely-ecrime-actor-capitalizing-on-falcon-sensor-issues/)\nSummary\n\nOn July 19, 2024, an issue present in a single content update for the CrowdStrike Falcon® sensor impacting Windows operating systems was identified, and a fix was deployed.1\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence has since observed threat actors leveraging the event to distribute a malicious ZIP archive named crowdstrike-hotfix.zip. The ZIP archive contains a HijackLoader payload that, when executed, loads RemCos. Notably, Spanish filenames and instructions within the ZIP archive indicate this campaign is likely targeting Latin America-based (LATAM) CrowdStrike customers.\n\nDetails\n\nOn July 19, 2024, a ZIP archive named crowdstrike-hotfix.zip (SHA256 hash: c44506fe6e1ede5a104008755abf5b6ace51f1a84ad656a2dccc7f2c39c0eca2) was uploaded to an online malware-scanning service by a Mexico-based submitter.\n\nThe ZIP file’s accompanying Spanish-language instructions appear to pose as a utility for automating recovery for the content update issue. The instructions prompt the user to run Setup.exe (SHA256 hash: 5ae3838d77c2102766538f783d0a4b4205e7d2cdba4e0ad2ab332dc8ab32fea9) to start the patch installation.\n\nWhen executed, Setup.exe will load and execute the HijackLoader first-stage inside madBasic_.bpl (SHA256 hash: d6d5ff8e9dc6d2b195a6715280c2f1ba471048a7ce68d256040672b801fda0ea) via DLL search-order hijacking.\n\nHijackLoader — advertised as a private crypting service, ASMCrypt — is a modular multi-stage loader highly focused on evading detection. The HijackLoader configuration file named maidenhair.cfg (SHA256 hash: 931308cfe733376e19d6cd2401e27f8b2945cec0b9c696aebe7029ea76d45bf6) contains data that the loader leverages to execute the final RemCos payload, which contacts the command-and-control (C2) server at 213.5.130[.]58[:]433.\n\nFollowing the content update issue, several typosquatting domains impersonating CrowdStrike have been identified. This campaign marks the first observed instance in which a threat actor has capitalized on the Falcon content issue to distribute malicious files targeting LATAM-based CrowdStrike customers.\n\nRecommendations\n\nCrowdStrike Intelligence recommends that organizations ensure they are communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels and adhere to technical guidance the CrowdStrike support teams have provided.\n\nFalcon LogScale Queries\n\nThis Falcon LogScale query detects the activity described in this report:\n\n// Hunting query for indicators (CSA-240835) case { in(\"SHA256HashData\", values=[\"931308cfe733376e19d6cd2401e27f8b2945cec0b9c696aebe7029ea76d45bf6\", \"c44506fe6e1ede5a104008755abf5b6ace51f1a84ad656a2dccc7f2c39c0eca2\", \"48a3398bbbf24ecd64c27cb2a31e69a6b60e9a69f33fe191bcf5fddbabd9e184\", \"d6d5ff8e9dc6d2b195a6715280c2f1ba471048a7ce68d256040672b801fda0ea\"]); in(\"RemoteAddressIP4\", values=[\"213.5.130.58\"]) } | table([cid, aid, #event_simpleName, ComputerName])\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nNombre del ArchivoSHA256 HashCrowdstrike-hotfix.zip c44506fe6e1ede5a104008755abf5b6ace51f1a84ad656a2dccc7f2c39c0eca2sqlite3.dll02f37a8e3d1790ac90c04bc50de73cd1a93e27caf833a1e1211b9cc6294ecee5vclx120.bpl2bdf023c439010ce0a786ec75d943a80a8f01363712bbf69afc29d3e2b5306edinstrucciones.txt4f450abaa4daf72d974a830b16f91deed77ba62412804dca41a6d42a7d8b6fd0maddisAsm_.bpl52019f47f96ca868fa4e747c3b99cba1b7aa57317bf8ebf9fcbf09aa576fe006Setup.exe5ae3838d77c2102766538f783d0a4b4205e7d2cdba4e0ad2ab332dc8ab32fea9datastate.dll6010e2147a0f51a7bfa2f942a5a9eaad9a294f463f717963b486ed3f53d305c2madexcept_.bpl835f1141ece59c36b18e76927572d229136aeb12eff44cb4ba98d7808257c299maidenhair.cfg (HijackLoader configuration)931308cfe733376e19d6cd2401e27f8b2945cec0b9c696aebe7029ea76d45bf6rtl120.bplb1fcb0339b9ef4860bb1ed1e5ba0e148321be64696af64f3b1643d1311028cb3vcl120.bplb6f321a48812dc922b26953020c9a60949ec429a921033cfaf1e9f7d088ee628battuta.flvbe074196291ccf74b3c4c8bd292f92da99ec37a25dc8af651bd0ba3f0d020349madBasic_.bpl\n\n(HijackLoader first-stage)\n\nd6d5ff8e9dc6d2b195a6715280c2f1ba471048a7ce68d256040672b801fda0eaRemCos Payload48a3398bbbf24ecd64c27cb2a31e69a6b60e9a69f33fe191bcf5fddbabd9e184RemCos C2 Address213.5.130[.]58[:]443\n\nTable 1.

This includes \"impersonating CrowdStrike staff in phone calls,\" and \"posing as independent researchers, claiming to have evidence the technical issue is linked to a cyberattack.\"\n\nThe company's blog post lists several malicious domains that the hackers have been using.\n\n(Credit: CrowdStrike)\n\nOriginal story:\n\nWatch out for emails that claim to come from CrowdStrike. Hackers have been quick to exploit Friday’s massive IT outage by posing as the cybersecurity company behind the disruption.\n\nThe US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and UK National Cyber Security Centre issued alerts warning about phishing emails attempting to capitalize on the chaos.\n\n\"An increase in phishing referencing this outage has already been observed, as opportunistic malicious actors seek to take advantage of the situation. This may be aimed at both organizations and individuals,\" the UK agency said.\n\nThe US-based SANS Technology Institute, which promotes cybersecurity, issued a similar warning. “Some reports we have seen indicate that there may be phishing emails circulating claiming to come from ‘Crowdstrike Support’ or ‘Crowdstrike Security,’” wrote Johannes Ullrich, the dean of research at the institute.\n\n“I do not have any samples at this point, but attackers are likely leveraging the heavy media attention. Please be careful with any ‘patches’ that may be delivered this way,” he added. “One domain possibly associated with these phishing attacks is: crowdfalcon-immed-update [.] com.”\n\nThe outage represents a ripe opportunity for cybercriminals since it's affecting numerous companies, including airlines. In total, CrowdStrike has about 29,000 enterprise customers — many of which are likely scrambling to resolve Friday’s disruption\n\nCrowdStrike has issued an advisory on how companies and individual users can restore affected Windows systems, which has been sourced to a faulty software update. Nevertheless, phishing emails dressed up to look like the cybersecurity vendor could trick customers desperate for help.\n\nThe Texas Department of Information Resources added that's it's been \"receiving reports that bad actors are impersonating CrowdStrike employees to gain access credentials.\"\n\nSome cybersecurity researchers have also spotted someone registering several internet domains using the names such as “crowdstrikebluescreen[.]com,” and “crowdstrike0day[.]com” — a sign that hackers are preparing to create numerous scam websites to exploit the outage.",

This zip file contains an executable named 'Crowdstrike.exe.'\n\nOnce the fake CrowdStrike update is executed, the data wiper is extracted to a folder under %Temp% and launched to destroy data stored on the device.\n\nMillions of Windows hosts crashed\n\nThe defect in CrowdStrike’s software update had a massive impact on Windows systems at numerous organizations, making it too good an opportunity for cybercriminals to pass.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, the faulty update “affected 8.5 million Windows devices, or less than one percent of all Windows machines.”\n\nThe damage happened in 78 minutes, between 04:09 UTC and 05:27 UTC.\n\nDespite the low percentage of affected systems and CrowdStrike’s effort to correct the issue quickly, the impact was huge.\n\nComputer crashes led to thousands of flights being canceled, disrupted activity at financial companies, brought down hospitals, media organizations, railways, and even impacted emergency services.\n\nIn a post-mortem blog post on Saturday, CrowdStrike explains that the cause of the outage was a channel file (sensor configuration) update to Windows hosts (version 7.11 and above) that triggered a logic error leading to a crash.",
