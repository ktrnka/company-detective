Great community tho it gets chaotic sometimes. Not a pay to enjoy game, but very easy to fall in the fomo(the iaps are crazy expensive, and only season pass are arguably worth getting; tgc also getting more aggressive w the predatory with their prices, bad sign imo).

      "https://apple/12021565515": "# The current state of the game…, 1 stars [(minnchip, Apple App Store, 2024-12-03)](https://apple/12021565515)\nSky is a cute, fun and calming game, I have had many wonderful experiences playing it with my friends over the years. However, I just can’t recommend the game in its current state. I am writing this review to call attention to problems that need addressing. Buckle in this is a long one\n\nFirst- Sky is absolutely falling apart with glitches. Every update this past year has caused the game to break down in some type of way; mass server disconnections, the appearance of your progress being erased, quests breaking, unusable features, and even one that’s happening right now- a glitch that causes the daily candle timer to repeatedly reset, breaking player character animations and softlocking your in-game currency collection.\nAnother very bad glitch was one that caused the screen to strobe flash in an area, which posed danger for those with epilepsy. This did not get fixed for over a month. It’s common for glitches in Sky to go without being fixed for lengthy periods of time, despite the community’s constant reports. I cannot understand how these issues continue to happen, and can only hope more systems are implemented to fix their code and prevent against such glitches.\n\nAlso, it’s a fact that hundreds of live-service games regularly gift their communities premium currency as an apology for glitches, or to show respect for sticking with them through the process of planned maintenance. I can only remember Sky doing this once, and it was after a huge outcry by the community some months ago after the game was in an unplayable state for a week. Something so common in other games is strangely not a regular habit here. It becomes more upsetting when you consider how Sky events & items are limited-time, that a large number of players are paying customers, and players must make effort every day farming candles to get the fun items they want before it’s gone. If something out of the player’s control prevents them from playing the game, there is often no compensation for what was lost. And if there is, it’s inadequate. A measly 15 candles + extending farming events (which serves to make players log in and work to earn themselves more of what they lost out on, through no fault of their own) after a week of the game being unplayable isn’t very fair. The community often accuses the company of being stingy and asks why they can’t show more goodwill. One of many reasons why players feel disconnected with the company.\n\nContinuing on that, yes a core gameplay of Sky is to collect candles, in-game currency used to purchase equipment and outfits. But more things seem to be getting changed which inconvenience the player with this. Player-created solutions to the repetitive farming get suddenly changed like locations for AFK idle light, or the controversial recent Grandma’s Table shared space removal. Harmless well-known strategies that help all players are patched out for unexplained reasons which makes people upset, and there is no “proper” alternative to those that’s offered. Events happen simultaneously which makes it difficult to save up candles and causes burnout from farming. Yet candles, cosmetics and more items are continually offered as expensive in-app purchases to buy with your real money.\n\nIt feels like the company doesn’t know what players want. The playerbase is stretched for their time, money, and feels like they are made to constantly experience FOMO. Of course, that is if they can play at all with the glitches.\n\nMany of my friends stopped playing in the last year, and I am likely soon to follow. Sky is such a beautiful, unique and relaxing game for me, but its state now is unfortunate. \nDevelopers- if you read this, I sincerely hope this serves as constructive criticism for you. I would truly love if the game and your treatment to players can improve in the future & encourage me and many others to return someday.",

Fix the basic bugs!, 3 stars [(Hardcore_Since_4, Apple App Store, 2025-01-17)](https://apple/12194434457)\nBeen playing 4 years. Since 2023ish many base functionality bugs keep reverting back, over n over. Terrible panning n zoom , 5/15 candles counted, lag that has nada to do with wifi (it's their servers). Rn? Handhold is silly broken again - a bug from 4 years ago replicated  at least 3 times since.  The bugs used to be funny but since they added FestWjat after aurora season and focusing more on  PC/steam, basic play has become so bugged that everyone is annoyed. The oldest players just gone now cuz it's frustrating to watch basics decline while they pump out more and more glittery prop.  \nOne major issue (if a long term player), is the friendship constellation where we can join friends who are online. It has been broken for OVER 2 YEARS - often, your besties will appear offline you if you log in before them and vise verse. The game isn't updating logins anymore. So if you log in after your other bestie has a;ready logged in, they won't see as being online in the home constellation. And you either get sad or force restart about 10 times til they finally show up.  So often I'll log in same time with my bff (pre- arranged off-game to meet up) and neither of us can see us being online even though we are in the same server. No biggie til you split 10 mins later and can't tp back. So.  Restart restart restart til one of us can find the other. But this is an on-going issue with so many of my friends who have played at leas years. Ppl without full constellation don't seem to have this prob as bad. \nAlso, be careful with chat - autocorrect vs AI censoring has gone crazy, very easy to be muted for 60 minutes foraying something basic like Hel lo or halo or HELLO. \nAll complaining aside,  Sky is an incredible game w/ an amazing community of ppl - it's really the friends we've made that keeps us oldies coming back so when chat or netting is so broken, it's a big deal . But tgc doesn't care about veterans lately, so idk.  Also? The Vanilla-icing aspect lately for kiddos is making this once very deep, sometimes dark game, feel cheesy n vanilla. Kids were rare when most of us started playing - in fact it was super uncommon for people to even ask ages or genders. New players all wanna unlock chat in a minute but not everyone wants chat unlock via qr. but feel guilty not accepting. \n\nThanks for the wonderful moments. I play because of my friends. But they're leaving because they'd appreciate less fluff and more depth again, lore!!! And some major challenge again like prophecy gave and krills. But it's also cuz of the heat overload sky has on mobiles np less than 2 years old - heatsink n  cpu/ on mobiles is burning batteries harder than 3 Genshins at once since pc/steam landed. Fix it!",

The graphics and storyline are on point, and this is one of the most safe online games I have ever encountered. In order to talk to another player you need to use candles to friend them, and then pay another candle for the chatting button. You can’t communicate while your friend is offline, either. You also can’t send a message for everyone to see, only your friends can see what you have typed. This makes the game a LOT more safe for kids. Being unable to widely broadcast a message will keep tons of people off of scam websites and away from gross adults. There is also a way to block other players, which is extremely helpful for safety. The storyline of the game is somewhat unclear, and it allows for the player to come up with their own ideas. I’ve played for years, and I’ve never been bored. Love you, Sky COTL <3",

Since then I have spent over $1k of real money and have been trying to find a way to strike against this app and get my money back so I can delete the game completely for I no longer want to continue investing into a game filled with glitches, Server drops, AI muting players for saying simple words that do not go against terms guide lines, not being able to successfully candle run due to glitches in game that can lose you out of 200+ candles a month (ex: grandma event not working for an entire month) and WITH TODAYS & YESTERDAYS SAME GLITCH OF daily refresh/ refresh of entire soul MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO EVEN PLAY. I want a complete refund, delete my account sky. You have proven to me that my 1k in 5 months has not invested in proper coding techniques nor the fact that this game is clearly not ready to be taking real money in general. Due to always feeling like everything will be fixed and my game play experience will go smoothly- I have been investing my own money to help the cause and to also make sure I am not losing out of candles while TGC are still putting out travel spirits, events and seasons around the same time with items costing no less than 9.99 (real money) and items that cost in game candles anywhere from 50-300 while only being able to get 22 candles a day max (you can only reach this is if you have 3+ hours to spend everyday). I am aware that we do not have to buy every item, though it is not fair when the game glitches to the point of not being able to receive the full amount of candles everyday. Not only that but you have to wait a year to even see if the same spirits/events/ seasons/ travel spirits will come if you miss an item… this is how they catch you and where the addiction starts. Enough of your games TGC. Please REFUND ME EVERY OUNCE OF MY MONEY. It is not our fault you are in debt due to the beginnings of the run of your app having failed in numbers and probably having to pay AURORA back. Stop using glitches as a reason your created addicts (once fans) use in game purchases for candles and items. This is sick and disturbing. You can find and ban hackers in a day that actually help people candle run and are the Robin Hood’s of this game during your glitches, but it takes a month for you to fix your glitches to increase your chances of in game purchases?!? You guys can’t even compensate for these huge in game mistakes?! STOP THIS OR THIS GAME WILL NO LONGER EXIST TGC!!! Please, for your fans that truly love what you have created, like I did. I was enjoying funding something as beautiful as you have created. But now you give me no choice for It has become greedy and unjust.",

Bug: try to deep call but flaps wings at the same time.\nThis problem didn’t even exist before, but one day, I was playing the game, and I try to deep call and I long press my character, I did long call, but I also flapped twice… pls fix this!\n2. Suggestion #1: the furniture! They’re. Too. Expensive. \nI mean, WHAT? 24 hearts for A BED? And to get another one I have to use ANOTHER 24 HEARTS?! You’ve gotta be kidding! 10 hearts for a shelf is… alright I guess. But why do I have to spend another 10 hearts for another one?! And the seashell music player needs 33 ASCENDED CANDLES?! FOR A MUSIC PLAYER?!! I could never :( . What’s more, lots of other furniture need a lot of ASCENDED CANDLES!! Seriously.😐. THE. FURNITURE. IS. TOO. EXPENSIVE. Pls fix this.\n3. Suggestion #2: Aviary entrance pole.\nWhere did it go? On a roof 😑. Plz put it back to the aviary entrance! I looks better there.\n4. Suggestion #3: Furniture sales.\nCan I sell the furniture I don’t want at the nesting workshop? That way I can earn candles and hearts without having to go through SOOO much trouble trying to buy A BED. If I can’t sell them, I should be able to trade them. Sky: The children of light is like living in a fantasy, magical life, so players should be able to sell and trade stuff, instead of just buying them. Helping spirits and completing quests given by them is a huge improvement, but I really think you should add this, lots of players would like that, I’m sure.\n5. Suggestion #4: Add more creatures?\nI was thinking, if there are dark dragons, maybe add some light dragons?\n6. Suggestion #5: Companion? Maybe?\nMaybe let players have animal companions? Like, not pets, but helps and follows players, or will arrive when called? That would be nice. Just a suggestion though.\n7. Suggestion #6: Nests\nOur nests are nice, but maybe expand them a bit, we have a small balcony, a room, a few windows and a doorway, but maybe separate our nests into three rooms? Like, a main room, where we enter, a slightly smaller room, and a slightly larger room. No need to change the balcony though. \nThat’s all. I hope you read my suggestions, and help with my bug, and I hope you’ll put them in the game. Otherwise, the game is amazing. Love it.",

The currency has been glitching and either not loading in, or taking ungodly amount of time to load in. The shard event happens to be completed every single server I jump to, no matter how early I am to the event. And eventually after a while, the game gets repetitive. Also I myself agree with the countless complaints i’ve heard/read about being a long term player having to go through the same long routes just to get where you’re trying to go in whatever realm you are in. I think there should at least be checkpoints to teleport to when you are not grinding for currency in the game.",

(also, other people can gift you the few items that cost real money.) no item that costs you real money will actually make progression easier, it’s all aesthetic items like clothes, instruments, or decorations. alright, i think that should tie up the logical stuff. now, let’s go on to my personal story with sky. // tw ; suicide, an abusive parent, mention of alcoholism. hi, i’m shrike. in 2021-22, i was depressed and living half with my alcoholic, emotionally abusive mother. i was depressed, exhausted, and barely coping. enter sky. a week into playing, i met hanna and yuri — from poland and italy respectively. i knew them as sixlets and beetle, because i had just nicknamed them after the first things to enter my head. we got along easily. i was a new player, and they were experienced and happy to guide me along. they only half knew what was going on — i wasn’t the kind of person to bother with telling them — but they were so kind and so considerate. when would make little comments about “ha yeah, my mom and sister are fighting rn, sorry if i type slow,” it was immediately virtual hugs and kindness. another friend who’s incredibly dear to me, cal, who is from the philippines. cal talked me down from suicide — i was about to overdose on my own medication, because of my situation. after that, if they were online i was online, and we never really seperated. my mom got drunk at a party and my sister had to drive us home, before she had her license, at one am. cal was my comfort, and they were so kind to me no matter what. and then the day after my mom got drunk, i got out. i was close to killing myself — but i got out of there and have been living with my dad since. i remember telling cal that i had gotten out , and i healed with them at my side. i’m still in therapy. i’m still recovering, and still unpacking what happened to me — but we were friends through it all. download sky. it got me through so much. even if you’re not doing as bad as i was, you’ll find yourself a happier person.",

Great community tho it gets chaotic sometimes. Not a pay to enjoy game, but very easy to fall in the fomo(the iaps are crazy expensive, and only season pass are arguably worth getting; tgc also getting more aggressive w the predatory with their prices, bad sign imo). Gets pretty boring easily after a while bc maps stay same. android is laggy and srsly needs huge overhaul to optimize in older devices",

And somehow i got stuck in a wall in the cafe at Aviary Village. i cannot get out --.

      "# The current state of the game…, 1 stars [(minnchip, Apple App Store, 2024-12-03)](https://apple/12021565515)\nSky is a cute, fun and calming game, I have had many wonderful experiences playing it with my friends over the years. However, I just can’t recommend the game in its current state. I am writing this review to call attention to problems that need addressing. Buckle in this is a long one\n\nFirst- Sky is absolutely falling apart with glitches. Every update this past year has caused the game to break down in some type of way; mass server disconnections, the appearance of your progress being erased, quests breaking, unusable features, and even one that’s happening right now- a glitch that causes the daily candle timer to repeatedly reset, breaking player character animations and softlocking your in-game currency collection.\nAnother very bad glitch was one that caused the screen to strobe flash in an area, which posed danger for those with epilepsy. This did not get fixed for over a month. It’s common for glitches in Sky to go without being fixed for lengthy periods of time, despite the community’s constant reports. I cannot understand how these issues continue to happen, and can only hope more systems are implemented to fix their code and prevent against such glitches.\n\nAlso, it’s a fact that hundreds of live-service games regularly gift their communities premium currency as an apology for glitches, or to show respect for sticking with them through the process of planned maintenance. I can only remember Sky doing this once, and it was after a huge outcry by the community some months ago after the game was in an unplayable state for a week. Something so common in other games is strangely not a regular habit here. It becomes more upsetting when you consider how Sky events & items are limited-time, that a large number of players are paying customers, and players must make effort every day farming candles to get the fun items they want before it’s gone. If something out of the player’s control prevents them from playing the game, there is often no compensation for what was lost. And if there is, it’s inadequate. A measly 15 candles + extending farming events (which serves to make players log in and work to earn themselves more of what they lost out on, through no fault of their own) after a week of the game being unplayable isn’t very fair. The community often accuses the company of being stingy and asks why they can’t show more goodwill. One of many reasons why players feel disconnected with the company.\n\nContinuing on that, yes a core gameplay of Sky is to collect candles, in-game currency used to purchase equipment and outfits. But more things seem to be getting changed which inconvenience the player with this. Player-created solutions to the repetitive farming get suddenly changed like locations for AFK idle light, or the controversial recent Grandma’s Table shared space removal. Harmless well-known strategies that help all players are patched out for unexplained reasons which makes people upset, and there is no “proper” alternative to those that’s offered. Events happen simultaneously which makes it difficult to save up candles and causes burnout from farming. Yet candles, cosmetics and more items are continually offered as expensive in-app purchases to buy with your real money.\n\nIt feels like the company doesn’t know what players want. The playerbase is stretched for their time, money, and feels like they are made to constantly experience FOMO. Of course, that is if they can play at all with the glitches.\n\nMany of my friends stopped playing in the last year, and I am likely soon to follow. Sky is such a beautiful, unique and relaxing game for me, but its state now is unfortunate. \nDevelopers- if you read this, I sincerely hope this serves as constructive criticism for you. I would truly love if the game and your treatment to players can improve in the future & encourage me and many others to return someday.",

      "# Please bring back  depth to this amazing game.  Fix the basic bugs!, 3 stars [(Hardcore_Since_4, Apple App Store, 2025-01-17)](https://apple/12194434457)\nBeen playing 4 years. Since 2023ish many base functionality bugs keep reverting back, over n over. Terrible panning n zoom , 5/15 candles counted, lag that has nada to do with wifi (it's their servers). Rn? Handhold is silly broken again - a bug from 4 years ago replicated  at least 3 times since.  The bugs used to be funny but since they added FestWjat after aurora season and focusing more on  PC/steam, basic play has become so bugged that everyone is annoyed. The oldest players just gone now cuz it's frustrating to watch basics decline while they pump out more and more glittery prop.  \nOne major issue (if a long term player), is the friendship constellation where we can join friends who are online. It has been broken for OVER 2 YEARS - often, your besties will appear offline you if you log in before them and vise verse. The game isn't updating logins anymore. So if you log in after your other bestie has a;ready logged in, they won't see as being online in the home constellation. And you either get sad or force restart about 10 times til they finally show up.  So often I'll log in same time with my bff (pre- arranged off-game to meet up) and neither of us can see us being online even though we are in the same server. No biggie til you split 10 mins later and can't tp back. So.  Restart restart restart til one of us can find the other. But this is an on-going issue with so many of my friends who have played at leas years. Ppl without full constellation don't seem to have this prob as bad. \nAlso, be careful with chat - autocorrect vs AI censoring has gone crazy, very easy to be muted for 60 minutes foraying something basic like Hel lo or halo or HELLO. \nAll complaining aside,  Sky is an incredible game w/ an amazing community of ppl - it's really the friends we've made that keeps us oldies coming back so when chat or netting is so broken, it's a big deal . But tgc doesn't care about veterans lately, so idk.  Also? The Vanilla-icing aspect lately for kiddos is making this once very deep, sometimes dark game, feel cheesy n vanilla. Kids were rare when most of us started playing - in fact it was super uncommon for people to even ask ages or genders. New players all wanna unlock chat in a minute but not everyone wants chat unlock via qr. but feel guilty not accepting. \n\nThanks for the wonderful moments. I play because of my friends. But they're leaving because they'd appreciate less fluff and more depth again, lore!!! And some major challenge again like prophecy gave and krills. But it's also cuz of the heat overload sky has on mobiles np less than 2 years old - heatsink n  cpu/ on mobiles is burning batteries harder than 3 Genshins at once since pc/steam landed. Fix it!",

The graphics and storyline are on point, and this is one of the most safe online games I have ever encountered. In order to talk to another player you need to use candles to friend them, and then pay another candle for the chatting button. You can’t communicate while your friend is offline, either. You also can’t send a message for everyone to see, only your friends can see what you have typed. This makes the game a LOT more safe for kids. Being unable to widely broadcast a message will keep tons of people off of scam websites and away from gross adults. There is also a way to block other players, which is extremely helpful for safety. The storyline of the game is somewhat unclear, and it allows for the player to come up with their own ideas. I’ve played for years, and I’ve never been bored. Love you, Sky COTL <3",

Since then I have spent over $1k of real money and have been trying to find a way to strike against this app and get my money back so I can delete the game completely for I no longer want to continue investing into a game filled with glitches, Server drops, AI muting players for saying simple words that do not go against terms guide lines, not being able to successfully candle run due to glitches in game that can lose you out of 200+ candles a month (ex: grandma event not working for an entire month) and WITH TODAYS & YESTERDAYS SAME GLITCH OF daily refresh/ refresh of entire soul MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO EVEN PLAY. I want a complete refund, delete my account sky. You have proven to me that my 1k in 5 months has not invested in proper coding techniques nor the fact that this game is clearly not ready to be taking real money in general. Due to always feeling like everything will be fixed and my game play experience will go smoothly- I have been investing my own money to help the cause and to also make sure I am not losing out of candles while TGC are still putting out travel spirits, events and seasons around the same time with items costing no less than 9.99 (real money) and items that cost in game candles anywhere from 50-300 while only being able to get 22 candles a day max (you can only reach this is if you have 3+ hours to spend everyday). I am aware that we do not have to buy every item, though it is not fair when the game glitches to the point of not being able to receive the full amount of candles everyday. Not only that but you have to wait a year to even see if the same spirits/events/ seasons/ travel spirits will come if you miss an item… this is how they catch you and where the addiction starts. Enough of your games TGC. Please REFUND ME EVERY OUNCE OF MY MONEY. It is not our fault you are in debt due to the beginnings of the run of your app having failed in numbers and probably having to pay AURORA back. Stop using glitches as a reason your created addicts (once fans) use in game purchases for candles and items. This is sick and disturbing. You can find and ban hackers in a day that actually help people candle run and are the Robin Hood’s of this game during your glitches, but it takes a month for you to fix your glitches to increase your chances of in game purchases?!? You guys can’t even compensate for these huge in game mistakes?! STOP THIS OR THIS GAME WILL NO LONGER EXIST TGC!!! Please, for your fans that truly love what you have created, like I did.

But once you go through the game there’s not a reason to come back. They could’ve added more to actually do in the game like more trials, platforming, mini games.. something.\n\n   But instead they just add some short stories to walk through with extremely expensive cosmetics to buy and a painfully long farming machine that is getting candles to unlock things. Then they make this worse by having “traveling spirits” that come back with cosmetic options that you can only get for a few days and poof their gone. So this also incentivizes players to spend hours getting candles. \n\n   Fun for a few days as a new player but otherwise there is no reason to stay playing this game.",

      "# Great but bug and suggestions, 5 stars [(tingyao2, Apple App Store, 2025-02-11)](https://apple/12301001684)\nI totally love this game, but there are a few things :\n1. Bug: try to deep call but flaps wings at the same time.\nThis problem didn’t even exist before, but one day, I was playing the game, and I try to deep call and I long press my character, I did long call, but I also flapped twice… pls fix this!\n2. Suggestion #1: the furniture! They’re. Too. Expensive. \nI mean, WHAT? 24 hearts for A BED? And to get another one I have to use ANOTHER 24 HEARTS?! You’ve gotta be kidding! 10 hearts for a shelf is… alright I guess. But why do I have to spend another 10 hearts for another one?! And the seashell music player needs 33 ASCENDED CANDLES?! FOR A MUSIC PLAYER?!! I could never :( . What’s more, lots of other furniture need a lot of ASCENDED CANDLES!! Seriously.😐. THE. FURNITURE. IS. TOO. EXPENSIVE. Pls fix this.\n3. Suggestion #2: Aviary entrance pole.\nWhere did it go? On a roof 😑. Plz put it back to the aviary entrance! I looks better there.\n4. Suggestion #3: Furniture sales.\nCan I sell the furniture I don’t want at the nesting workshop? That way I can earn candles and hearts without having to go through SOOO much trouble trying to buy A BED. If I can’t sell them, I should be able to trade them. Sky: The children of light is like living in a fantasy, magical life, so players should be able to sell and trade stuff, instead of just buying them. Helping spirits and completing quests given by them is a huge improvement, but I really think you should add this, lots of players would like that, I’m sure.\n5. Suggestion #4: Add more creatures?\nI was thinking, if there are dark dragons, maybe add some light dragons?\n6. Suggestion #5: Companion? Maybe?\nMaybe let players have animal companions? Like, not pets, but helps and follows players, or will arrive when called? That would be nice. Just a suggestion though.\n7. Suggestion #6: Nests\nOur nests are nice, but maybe expand them a bit, we have a small balcony, a room, a few windows and a doorway, but maybe separate our nests into three rooms? Like, a main room, where we enter, a slightly smaller room, and a slightly larger room. No need to change the balcony though. \nThat’s all. I hope you read my suggestions, and help with my bug, and I hope you’ll put them in the game. Otherwise, the game is amazing. Love it.",

The currency has been glitching and either not loading in, or taking ungodly amount of time to load in. The shard event happens to be completed every single server I jump to, no matter how early I am to the event. And eventually after a while, the game gets repetitive. Also I myself agree with the countless complaints i’ve heard/read about being a long term player having to go through the same long routes just to get where you’re trying to go in whatever realm you are in. I think there should at least be checkpoints to teleport to when you are not grinding for currency in the game.",

Bloom cape is now iap (has NEVER been before, and has ALWAYS been the main item.) the majority of the community is begging for quality over quantity and you are NOT listening to us, so I will be writing this here. The iaps are ridiculously priced (there is no justification for $20 for ONE cosmetic item, which seems to be a recurring issue.)

      "# do yourself a favor — get sky., 5 stars [(Crow__Kid, Apple App Store, 2024-10-26)](https://apple/11877353062)\nalright , this isn’t a recipe blog — i’ll do the reasons first and the personal story last. 1) sky is a social game, and while in some cases a brief interaction may be necessary, around 60% of the time it isn’t — and you can make people get a notification that you don’t want to be around people right now before they teleport to you or try to interact. 2) sky isn’t difficult. i’m a casual gamer who hasn’t played a true fighting game since around 2021, so you can imagine i’m not good at fighting games — and the only real enemies in this game are so easy to get past that i antagonize them for fun. and if you get hit? unless you somehow glitched there with only one winged light, it’s fairly easy to get your wl back. 3) i’ve had one semi-rude encounter in my roughly two years of playing sky. most people are infinitely kind, because the game actively nurtures that. friendly fire is near impossible, because someone has to not only actively place you in the line of a dark dragon, you also have to be new enough to not reach cover — which , by the way, is everywhere. like. seriously. it’s near impossible to get friendly fired, and most people are nice enough to not try unless they’re a Really close friend and they know you’re kind enough to find it funny. 4) the diversity on this app is insane. i learned a second language because of this game. i know people from poland, japan, china, south korea, the philippines — all because of this game. you’ll learn things you never knew. 5) it’s not pay to win. (also, other people can gift you the few items that cost real money.) no item that costs you real money will actually make progression easier, it’s all aesthetic items like clothes, instruments, or decorations. alright, i think that should tie up the logical stuff. now, let’s go on to my personal story with sky. // tw ; suicide, an abusive parent, mention of alcoholism. hi, i’m shrike. in 2021-22, i was depressed and living half with my alcoholic, emotionally abusive mother. i was depressed, exhausted, and barely coping. enter sky. a week into playing, i met hanna and yuri — from poland and italy respectively. i knew them as sixlets and beetle, because i had just nicknamed them after the first things to enter my head. we got along easily. i was a new player, and they were experienced and happy to guide me along. they only half knew what was going on — i wasn’t the kind of person to bother with telling them — but they were so kind and so considerate. when would make little comments about “ha yeah, my mom and sister are fighting rn, sorry if i type slow,” it was immediately virtual hugs and kindness. another friend who’s incredibly dear to me, cal, who is from the philippines. cal talked me down from suicide — i was about to overdose on my own medication, because of my situation. after that, if they were online i was online, and we never really seperated. my mom got drunk at a party and my sister had to drive us home, before she had her license, at one am. cal was my comfort, and they were so kind to me no matter what. and then the day after my mom got drunk, i got out. i was close to killing myself — but i got out of there and have been living with my dad since. i remember telling cal that i had gotten out , and i healed with them at my side. i’m still in therapy. i’m still recovering, and still unpacking what happened to me — but we were friends through it all. download sky. it got me through so much. even if you’re not doing as bad as i was, you’ll find yourself a happier person.",

      "# Post ID 203g3t: thatgamecompany Internship Success Story - Small Words of Advice with +18 score by [(RandyGaul, Reddit, 2014-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/203g3t/thatgamecompany_internship_success_story_small/)\nRecently inspired by a [friend of mine's](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1wyuwc/my_story_of_getting_a_job_at_naughty_dog/) success story I decided to [share mine as well](http://www.randygaul.net/2014/03/10/thatgamecompany-internship/). I've recently accepted an offer to the wonderful company [thatgamecompany](http://thatgamecompany.com/) (the redundancy is quite funny isn't it)!\n\nHow I came into contact with the company was totally informal compared to what my previous imagination would have fancied. I also include a small tidbit of what advice I can muster for anyone else still attending school in a similar situation. I'll try to copy/paste the article here, but there is a picture of my awesome T-Shirt at my own website :)\n\n[Link to article](http://www.randygaul.net/2014/03/10/thatgamecompany-internship/)\n\n>Recently inspired by my colleague Allen's interesting blog post about his hiring experience I've decided to follow suit and share my own experience on acquiring an internship the year before graduation!\n\n>I'm sure most anyone reading my blog knows of a company called thatgamecompany. I have recently been offered a summer internship! The company is an amazing one and I personally feel that I belong at such a place. I'll see how good of a fit we make in the coming months, though I remain extremely optimistic about the whole thing.\n\n>Smaller game companies seem to work like a mini-Valve in that the team structure is flat. When speaking with thatgamecompany's lead engineer John and researching the company I was drawn towards the way that John detailed about the internals of company working. One thing that stuck out to me most was that John had mentioned that often times a developer will get an idea, experiment and try it out and see how things go. If a good idea is placed into the game other employees will recognize this and \"hop on the bandwagon\" to work together to get to the next iteration. John had mentioned that he feels a good fit for a team structure like this are individuals with a lot of initiative. I myself strive for an environment that embraces initiative, experimentation and professional growth.\n\n>They even sent me one of their AWESOME T-Shirts! Special thanks to a particular someone's mom :)\n\n>So I've been struttin round with my snazzy shirt for weeks ever since I was made an offer. I think it would be fun to describe how I actually met John Edwards, one of the founders, in an effort to perhaps inspire others to do similar.\n\n>In my early studies at DigiPen I was hungry to find all resources that exist on the C++ topic of code reflection. thatgamecompany's lead engineer John Edwards had made some sample material available to students at my university a few years earlier, and at the end of his material he left his email in case anyone wanted to contact him.\n\n>Happy to have found the exact reference material I needed I implemented all that was presented, and then added a whole lot more atop. After feeling great about the results I emailed John thanking him for his contribution of knowledge and linked him to one of my portfolio videos. I do this with most people that give out GDC lectures or other types of online-material, as I know from experience that seeing others' work benefit from your own material grants a very rewarding feeling -like a sense altruism satiated.\n\n>John ended up liking my video and asked me to shoot him an email next year if I was interested in interning at thatgamecompany. At first (as a Sophomore) my mind wasn't on internships or hiring in any way, and I was really just lucky I sent him an email at all.\n\n>The interview process was actually super long spanning a couple months. Albeit Christmas did strike through the middle of the process, it was still long. The usual is programming tests, phone interviews followed by some form of in-person meetup and additional interviews; interviewing with thatgamecompany mostly followed this format. Knowing 3D math to point where it feels like a language in and of itself, and proficiency in C++ seem to be pretty much the only requirements to make oneself appealing as a potential hire (as for as tech skill goes for engineers). If anyone wants tips on how to practice for interviewing my advice would be to make sure you're proficient in your area of study. Beyond this I find that practicing writing code on a white-board helps for formal coding interviews, practicing with a mock-interviewer. For me personally the biggest practice was just repetition of mock coding interviews to keep me from being nervous. When I'm nervous my mind can go pretty blank.\n\n>Hopefully my luck will last out a little longer as I proceed towards graduation!\n\n>In this I would say the moral of the story is: people that write or put forth educational content always do so with an interest to teach others. If one is genuinely interested in the content and contacts the original authors with a thank you, they will inevitably be interested, especially if intelligent followup questions are asked. I would suppose that seeing others benefit and take interest in your area of study is just irresistible. It's a great way to thank wonderful people and educate yourself at the same time. I've done this with dozens of various authors of all sorts of content, and every single one of them has always responded very generously; I'm very thankful to them all for their willingness to help.\n\n## Comment ID cfzmeti with +4 score by [(MahoganyMadness, Reddit, 2014-03-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/203g3t/thatgamecompany_internship_success_story_small/cfzmeti/) (in reply to ID 203g3t):\nThat's a great opportunity and some great advice!

Does anyone know if there is actually a lore-based connection, or is it just a case of similar style and/or reused assets?\n\n## Comment ID h7uwcqz with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-08-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/JourneyPS3/comments/oyrwuq/is_journey_connected_to_flow/h7uwcqz/) (in reply to ID oyrwuq):\nThey're both made by thatgamecompany. \n\nIn all likelihood, it's just a fun easter egg they decided to throw in there.\n\n## Comment ID h7ux7q8 with +7 score by [(Unstab3l, Reddit, 2021-08-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/JourneyPS3/comments/oyrwuq/is_journey_connected_to_flow/h7ux7q8/) (in reply to ID oyrwuq):\nTwo trophies in Journey are tied to previous thatgamecompany games...\n\n## Comment ID h7vnuh6 with +6 score by [(Aynessachan, Reddit, 2021-08-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/JourneyPS3/comments/oyrwuq/is_journey_connected_to_flow/h7vnuh6/) (in reply to ID oyrwuq):\nIt's just a style / easter egg thing.

It can also be on old consoles that I can emulate on my potato, like PS2/PS1 and such. The things I specially liked about Sky is the marvelous community, due to how friendly and wholesome it is, and the exploration aspect without a focus on combat, so if you guys know any games that share these things, please also mention them <3\n\nList of similar games (or with similar aspects) that I know of and that could help someone in the same condition as me:\n- Flower (made by the same company)\n- Journey (also made by the same company)\n- AER: Memories of the Old (very similar gameplay and character design, singleplayer)\n- Shadow of the Colossus and ICO (although singleplayer, both contain some really nice scenario which reminds me a bit of Sky and also a nice atmosphere)\n- Death Stranding (its narrative talks about the importance of the connection with other people and you can also place ladders and ropes to help other players during their traversal)\n- Breath of the Wild (open world with good exploration, similar graphics and overall a very pleasant atmosphere)\n- Sea of Thieves (this is very subjective to experience, but from time to time I've seen players being really nice to one another, helping strangers and going on adventures)\n\nThank you to all of those who help with reccomendations and thank you to thatgamecompany, for making such an incredible game capable of uniting strangers together and forming friendships.\n\nPS: Sorry if the text's format gets messed up, I'm currently on mobile but I'll fix it once I'm able to use a computer.\n\n## Comment ID gq645st with +3 score by [(boom_katz, Reddit, 2021-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/m01sw8/similar_games_on_pc/gq645st/) (in reply to ID m01sw8):\nthe pathless, abzu, stardew valley, monument valley and no man's sky\n\n### Comment ID gq67l3o with +2 score by [(CyberMig, Reddit, 2021-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/m01sw8/similar_games_on_pc/gq67l3o/) (in reply to ID gq645st):\nThanks!

So don’t waste your time collecting wax because it doesn’t register it as you collecting wax and you get nothing. It sucks and it’s why we should demand compensation because people can’t collect candles or seasonal candles like this, and yet they’re still rolling out the next TS in 2 days, the shattering group is still on its way, and Days of Sunlight is wasting away for anyone who wanted to grind candles for the past event cosmetics they missed last year.\n\n#### Comment ID lkbfkuo with +10 score by [(FierceDeity_, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1f33x3n/day_3_of_server_errors/lkbfkuo/) (in reply to ID lkb0g4t):\nJust FIY and maybe it helps understanding what is happening in this game:\n\nThe game uses (at least) 2 types of servers to run the main functionality. One are called \"level servers\" which are the servers you run around with people in. They're pretty low risk, and they're the ones that show \"yellow wifi\" if you break apart with one and such. There are many of these, and they have random IPs, so I can't say much about what addresses they have. They are seemingly also scattered worldwide, so you can be connected to a close one, making it seemingly more likely that peolpe you encounter in the wild are closer to you (unless you followed someone from another continent), but I'm not conclusive in any way about that. \n\nThe second type is about permanent progress. If you collect candles, anything, it goes to that server as a request, and then it confirms back by adding your candle amount. They are (or is) the bookkeepers, so to say. The main address to reach that one is https://live.radiance.thatgamecompany.com/ and the endpoint they use to pick up wax is https://live.radiance.thatgamecompany.com/account/collect_pickup_batch. These are the ones that cause problems currently, it seems they (temporarily?) lose progress. They're also the ones that send you your current inventory and progress when you log in. They also seem to run chat, and I haven't snooped in on any traffic (since that is encrypted + would mean hacking the game and I don't want to break TOS. I've gathered all of this info by reading the game log file that is readily available to read on PC and just looking at open connections from the outside)\n\nThis is why you can normally collect wax just fine even during a server split while \"yellow wifi\" is on, because you are never just interacting with one server. \n\nThere is at least one more server but I am not sure what that one is about atm. The address it connects to is https://stream.starwatch.ai/. My current assumption is it collects gameplay data for telemetry or something, since the device keeps uploading small amounts to it. It also may be their backup for \"things that have happened in the game\", like a recording of the things you did, and this data may be used to give you your wax back as soon as radiance is stable again. I hope. They may also just ignore it like usual when they have a bug and not compensate anything :/\n\n## Comment ID lkb0vb8 with +21 score by [(debrizz_30035, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1f33x3n/day_3_of_server_errors/lkb0vb8/) (in reply to ID 1f33x3n):\nFr I can't collect tickets no point trying to cr with error messages popping up every min season quests keep restarting cutscenes be buggin as a mf.. is this a joke to them? 3 days...\n\n### Comment ID lkb1r6z with +7 score by [(ManedCalico, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1f33x3n/day_3_of_server_errors/lkb1r6z/) (in reply to ID lkb0vb8):\nI don’t know what time zone you’re in, but I noticed today that the errors weren’t showing up around 2pm PDT.

They can spend tons of money for collaborations, new IAPs and it just feels like they ignore most of the bugs and are even raising prices like crazy. I don't personally care for my candles, I have more than 2k candles so a 200 candles cello isn't a problem for me, but I genuinely feel bad for other players because sure, 200 candles is a lot, especially when you've been promised a group TS coming real soon, and add to that these server errors forcing people to buy candle packs instead of candle running?\n\nIt's a scam. And I'm f*cking done with these outrageous IAP prices, it needs to change and I'm not sugarcoating TGC anymore, they need to learn and I hope they will because I miss how compassionate and friendly the company was before, now they just feel like EA and other big companies, fueled by Greed.\n\n### Comment ID lkblj79 with +3 score by [(Overall-Mulberry-290, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1f33x3n/day_3_of_server_errors/lkblj79/) (in reply to ID lkb4ibc):\nFor real they just know how to gain money and put EVERYTHING IAP but not fixing their shit\n\n### Comment ID lkblj8v with +2 score by [(fooboohoo, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1f33x3n/day_3_of_server_errors/lkblj8v/) (in reply to ID lkb4ibc):\nThis\n\n## Comment ID lkb0ac7 with +8 score by [(Actual_Concern5377, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1f33x3n/day_3_of_server_errors/lkb0ac7/) (in reply to ID 1f33x3n):\nGod damn itttt I just want my pool floatttttt😭😭\n\n### Comment ID lkb0hs8 with +4 score by [(ManedCalico, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1f33x3n/day_3_of_server_errors/lkb0hs8/) (in reply to ID lkb0ac7):\nMe toooooo gimmie the floatie!!\n\n## Comment ID lkb4pkj with +8 score by [(niczaz58, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1f33x3n/day_3_of_server_errors/lkb4pkj/) (in reply to ID 1f33x3n):\nit feels weirdly consistent to me, i've tried playing at earlier times and it works fine, but late at night when i actually have the time to play the servers keep dying! i really hope they compensate us in some way cause this just is unacceptable especially with all the new stuff they just added\n\n### Comment ID lkb5i9d with +4 score by [(ManedCalico, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1f33x3n/day_3_of_server_errors/lkb5i9d/) (in reply to ID lkb4pkj):\nThat’s been my experience too.

      "# Post ID r3j1y8: Sky company cynicism is disheartening with +201 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/r3j1y8/sky_company_cynicism_is_disheartening/)\nEvery time something happens in Sky, whether it be candle prices, iaps, placement of ts, new feature decisions, new event dates, in every corner I always see this heavy cynicism that's usually along these lines:\n\n\"- TGC doesn't actually care about the stuff they put out, at the end of the day its all about money. Tsktsk\"\n\nFrom a practical point of view I can see how this may be true. Tgc is a company, they must make a profit.\n\nBut the narrative that's always pulled is more malicious, like tgc is rubbing their hands together, thinking of ways to extract as much money as possible, while laughing at f2p players from the sidelines. I even see comparisons to some benign candle price decision as EA tactics -- I read this and I laugh.\n\nI love games, and have spent time looking into the game industry, only for me to realize that game making is this insane unending maze of moving cogs with deadlines, crunch, bugs, creative vision, compromises and expectations. Think about candle running when you really don't want to, how soul draining it can be. Multiply that by about x1000, and you have a good sense of how it feels making productive game decisions while considering playerbase feedback.\n\nObviously it's not always this doomsday. Ideally a healthy game company has measures to make game building a smooth experience. But this is rare, and with live games like Sky, there is always something new to develop or conceptualize. And now with Sky being a switch port (which i personally found pretty ambitious) there is another layer of game creation that has its own can of worms.\n\nYou don't have to excuse tgc for bad decisions, but at least consider that it's not as simple as tgc going: more money=yes.\n\nWhen I read how many (especially those really active in the sky community)  blow off feature decisions or some price as \"greed, obviously!\" because they don't like it, and say it so confidently, its depressing. I can understand this if Sky's economy is horribly unbalanced, but while there is some grind creep with candles, Sky is easily one of the most inoffensive economies I've ever seen in gaming.\n\nIf there's a criticism I'd think is fair, sky should add more variety in how we collect candles and interact with players. Thankfully they've had a good start with the afk spots, but there's room for improvement.\n\nThe reality is, we've no clue what is going on at thatgamecompany or why they make their decisions, and players have an unavoidable bias to think that they're being plotted against, because they can't get a cosmetic the want in time before it leaves.\n\nEven if I were to grant that tgc is being purely greedy, they're doing a terrible job seeing how there are a ton of other game models that use this f2p/whale dynamic \\*much\\* more profitably via subscription service, ad revenue, chance based \"loot\" iaps, or gameplay advantages locked behind $$ walls.\n\nI acknowledge tgc can be more transparent with their decisions and more organized with their bugs.  I guess it's the knee-jerk arguments I see that I don't get, especially when players continue to pour hours in the game despite how apparently exploitive it is. I know it's easier said than done to shake off the FOMO monkey, but its not a game companies job to rip it off you.\n\nI just wish there were more tempered, thought out responses trying to help sky instead of being glass half empty about everything.\n\nLet me know your thoughts 🎤\n\n## Comment ID hmaygj0 with +65 score by [(Braign, Reddit, 2021-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/r3j1y8/sky_company_cynicism_is_disheartening/hmaygj0/) (in reply to ID r3j1y8):\nI agree, I budget $50 a month for my gaming hobby and I literally cannot spend that much on Sky lol. There isn't that much to buy. I play daily and save candles so I don't need the $50 candle pack, and have usually saved enough for TS trees too, only needing the $5 candle pack very rarely. My constellations/emotes are unlocked way slower but they're not going anywhere. I get a couple of IAP cosmetics when they come around at $10 each, and that's not even every month. I don't get a sense of money being grabbed at all.\n\nThat said, I started mid-Prince, so I haven't seen prices go up. I'm sure if things started out costing less candles and now cost more, I'd feel some type of way about it. But to me the prices are pretty balanced. \n\nI had 0 candles at the start of Mischief and definitely got sticker shock at a 99 candle cosmetic! But it gave us plenty of time to unlock the whole tree before the event ended. I didn't do all the maths, but I didn't need to do a full 20-candle CR daily for 3 weeks just to afford everything, I got everything unlocked after like 2 weeks. And the game never spammed or pressured me to buy candles to afford items sooner, or made me watch ads.\n\nSo I'm not sure where the \"greed\" comes into anything honestly.\n\n### Comment ID hmb66u3 with +19 score by [(hmmwatchasay, Reddit, 2021-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/r3j1y8/sky_company_cynicism_is_disheartening/hmb66u3/) (in reply to ID hmaygj0):\nI have been playing since belonging which is at least 2 winters ago, and i cant believe how easy it is nowadays to get candles!!

I understand how some people can see the game as too pricy and how some cosmetics have costed more candles. I also started mid prince so I haven't exactly seen the price increases. But like OP stated game making is a very stressful process and people need to realize it is a goddamn free game! \n\nSky never really asks for money or blocks things behind paywalls and are more of a suggestion if someone wants to. Candle running can be monotonous but some people need to realize there can be more to the game than just the cosmetics. I actually think that it is pretty beneficial for players to have to learn how to save up and spend on the cosmetics they want the most. It can teach the management of money and showing you can't always get everything unless you really work for it. \n\nThough some things I want to get are pretty expensive it is such a thrill to finally be able to afford it. Having a singular goal in mind rather than trying to clear out the whole tree of a spirit.\n\nOf course TGC isn't amazing and can make quite a lot of questionable decisions but compared to every other mobile company they feel like the light at the end of the tunnel shows one of the best cases of a game like Sky.\n\n#### Comment ID hmbcl1j with +5 score by [(Z3R0M3M35, Reddit, 2021-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/r3j1y8/sky_company_cynicism_is_disheartening/hmbcl1j/) (in reply to ID hmb0s1r):\nI completely agree with this.

I have been playing since Sept 2019. Before Sky, I had never paid for a game and couldn’t believe my luck when I found this beautiful calming f2p game. I played for a few months before I decided that the AP was a very small price to pay every couple of months if it helped develop the game. Some players really have no idea how far this game has come in the two years it became live, and everyone can progress to the same level without having to pay a penny.  My sister joined when the game became live on Android, she has completed all constellations like me, has max wing power like me and has not paid out any money and is and more than happy to continue playing that way. I understand that some players are minors and don’t always have the funds or their parents might not let them spend money on games but then that’s always going to be a problem with any game that offers cosmetics because of FOMO, but then isn’t that just the same as life? Having the newest cape, pants, hair etc does not affect your game play. I am  just really grateful for TGC,  for not only making such a wonderful game, but for allowing me make a great friendship that would not have happened had it not been for Sky and guess what? -  also completely free of charge! My only sadness - and I try not to think of it too much right now - is that one day the game may progress so much that my poor old device will no longer be compatible, but would I blame TGC?, of course not.\n\n## Comment ID hmb00k6 with +15 score by [(Z3R0M3M35, Reddit, 2021-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/r3j1y8/sky_company_cynicism_is_disheartening/hmb00k6/) (in reply to ID r3j1y8):\nTo be honest, I do really agree with this take. The primary purpose of the game is as an effective social/memory platform and there are some things I dislike (looking at you, hint UI...) but other than that it's pretty good.\n\nOne thing I noticed was some players complaining (might be too harsh, but ones I saw felt like this) about how some items were placed before others (ex. The latest wandering trader, with the hair before the cargo pants) and how expensive they were, and I feel items are not supposed to be the game's focus. But, I get the frustration.\nOne idea I had was to make elder/trade shops less linear and branch out like a skill tree. There is one side where you can pay less and it branches into the main area. When you pay to unlock one (lower priced) side it invests in part of the other side (I need to explain it better later), and Enhanced candles let you swap between sides instead of locking you behind a barrier.\n\nThe beta servers should probably be used for this, and maybe even a poll for players by logging/caching a dedicated candle station.\n\nOf course this is by no means perfect, but it may provide some amount of choice for how players want to customize. The devs also need to be careful to not make it visually complicated or overloading.\n\nEdit: Grammar, additional ideas for how to poll. And feel free to critique this idea, guys!\n\n## Comment ID hmbckke with +32 score by [(ShiraCheshire, Reddit, 2021-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/r3j1y8/sky_company_cynicism_is_disheartening/hmbckke/) (in reply to ID r3j1y8):\nIt's so sad to see people so outright hateful and insulting.\n\nI know several people who work at TGC- met them before they applied, am still friends with them now.

I remember one day noticing the Daylight cave area from the temples and then struggling to get up there.

I never know if my opinion or view is the most helpful because I’ve very rarely felt the urge to spend money in any game. In fact this season is the first time I’ve ever bought the AP and I’ve been playing since early 2020. When I see this argument in the Genshin community I can 100% see the point of it, the gatcha system can be very predatory but even then I never get annoyed or miffed when mihoyo makes certain decisions because what else do you expect from a company. Genshin is very free to play if you’re willing to put in more work to grind for in game currency instead of buying it. I know that just don’t buy is a weak argument and so I don’t ever say but some times there is this whining that I just think is amusing when all is said and done.\n\nNow that’s Genshin and Mihoyo a much larger and more popular game that Sky. When I see that same argument in this space I’m even more baffled. I never felt like TGC promotes things in a way that makes it seem like making purchases will greatly enhance you over playing for free. I think if any they try to foster more socialising and interaction between the players which I really appreciate and is the whole premise of the game. But TGC is also a much smaller indie company, they can’t be faulted for wanting to make a profit where they can, because I don’t imagine that they are just rolling in it. Obviously complaints can arise when it seems like they are actively incentivising profit over the values of the game but I’ve never personally felt like that\n\n## Comment ID hmb606b with +10 score by [(IpreferV, Reddit, 2021-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/r3j1y8/sky_company_cynicism_is_disheartening/hmb606b/) (in reply to ID r3j1y8):\nI agree with you. And TGC do gotta earn for its employees. It also breaks me when I see some criticism about the devs, especially that \"they don't care\" part. The EA tactic is one of the memes I've seen almost everywhere lmaoooo. \n\nThe heated debate that I can remember is about the AFK system. (Brief explanation about the afk system: they fixed it — you'll stop receiving wax after a certain time. When timer runs out, it'll only reset if you enter another area). While I understand that other players gotta earn that extra wax to buy something, there's a downside for your device when doing so — like overheating, which happens to me. There might be more I'm unaware of.\n\nYet with player criticisms, the afk system still lies here with us. It's probably gonna stay with us until we give them a sound feedback why not to. \n\nI understand that not everyone has the energy and time to do candle runs, hence AFKing. I've also felt the feeling of being pressured to collect waxes due to really high ts prices — which you mentioned 'having to cr when you don't want to' and why I had to skip some ts items — it burned me out. Season of TLP and weeks before Summer Lights to be exact. Tho getting what we waited and grinded for is one of the things that gives us satisfaction and sparks the fire back. \n\nI've only purchased one item in game once, which was the pass for SoF. Welp there went my savings lmao ;–; it is worth it dw lol\n\nIt's really nice of the devs not locking the majority of the features of the game behind purchases/paywalls (like others already said). Imagine us getting ads every time we enter a new area... No. \n\nI also would like to add, with all these criticisms and whatnot, I still chose to play this game. Sole reason? I've met very nice people whom I'd probably not know their existence if it weren't for this game.\n\nI suppose criticisms and complains are in our nature. It's just that we gotta consider who we could hurt when expressing our thoughts.\n\nsheesh this somehow took me a very long time. oh it's quarter to 4 in the morning\n\n## Comment ID hmclx7n with +11 score by [(Mellon_Choly, Reddit, 2021-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/r3j1y8/sky_company_cynicism_is_disheartening/hmclx7n/) (in reply to ID r3j1y8):\nThank you for this post!!!! This really needed to be said. \n\nSky is the best mobile game I've ever played, by far. It's a wonderful blend of gorgeous art and music, (generally) innocent friendships, goals to reach towards, and daily things to do. TGC has done an amazing job, and it's obvious how much they really do care about the messages behind the game. Otherwise, why would they put so much effort into the storylines, the little mechanics of the friendship system, the new areas, etc., instead of simply pumping out more expensive cosmetics for us to spend money on? Cosmetics are a huge part of the game, but they're not the only part. It's really partly our fault for getting so hooked on collecting them all. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that as much as we may complain or poke fun at the inconveniences or inconsistencies in the game (I'm definitely guilty of that), it's always good to return back to how much we love what TGC has done with Sky. \n\n(yeesh that was a whole essay)\n\n## Comment ID hmbmhmg with +9 score by [(ferrettt55, Reddit, 2021-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/r3j1y8/sky_company_cynicism_is_disheartening/hmbmhmg/) (in reply to ID r3j1y8):\nIf I didn't already know that this game had in-app purchases, I would never know.

Of course it's not tgc's fault, but neither is the player's, it's just an unfortunate situation.\n\nHere, the only thing that I consider having a fair price for all the things you get (and I'm happy to pay for whenever I can) are the adventure passes. On the other hand, paying for one single item that costs the same as an AP, sometimes more, is so far from my reality. And hose smaller rare and cheap items like the orange or... (Can't remember what else was that cheap), while I appreciate the existence of such cheap items, they're really basic and meh (FOR ME). If there were more of those 1, 2 dollar items and they weren't so random and meh (again, imo), it would appease the folks that live in a place with f***ed up economy, like me.\n\nBut anyways, no hard feelings, being a developer is a hard job and the game is beautiful.\n\n### Comment ID hmck477 with +3 score by [(Kashawinshky, Reddit, 2021-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/r3j1y8/sky_company_cynicism_is_disheartening/hmck477/) (in reply to ID hmbp2u9):\nThat's a good point.\n\nI've often wondered how TGC arrives at its price point for the event IAPs.

In my gut I really believe that pricing something at $5 instead of $10, or $7 instead of $15, that many, many more people would buy it. \n\nAs it is, I have so much stuff in my closet now that I've become very selective and I'll only buy an AP and a $2 item or something I've wanted for over a year. \n\nI know that if prices were much lower for the IAP cosmetics I'd buy them; but at the price for most IAP capes I just don't have the FOMO anymore.\n\n## Comment ID hme28vg with +4 score by [(TheFantasticNiffler, Reddit, 2021-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/r3j1y8/sky_company_cynicism_is_disheartening/hme28vg/) (in reply to ID r3j1y8):\nFINALLY somebody says this.

I'm in the discord and the MOMENT jelly came out as a TS and people saw the tree had been rearranged (to fit a prop in)-- and that the hair had moved to where you had to buy it to get to the pants-- they were screaming about it being a paywall. Candles are FREE. It's not a paywall unless you MAKE it one. Jelly will be back. Your 20 dollars spent on a candle pack won't. I understand being disappointed, but TS return home eventually and screaming at tgc will not do anything. They won't recode the spirit tree just for you guys when they're on holiday and only have a few days to do it. Just take the L and try again. \n\nPlus the TS drops into home on Thursday and that means if you did 15 a day for the 4 days it's there you'd get 60 candles. You could get 80 if you did a full run. People were so upset because they \"only saved enough to get the pants\" meaning they had at least 65-70 candles, but 40 candles is not hard to get. It's literally two days worth of CR and with grandma and the social light areas it's EVEN EASIER than before when you had to run all the realms. Plus people who said they only saved enough for the pants.... Uh? That means to knew jelly was coming before the reveal which means you saw the TS leak. It's not TGCs fault you saw a leak and saved the bare minimum for the things you wanted because you assumed nothing would change (which no one should bc we all know props are coming back in and that changes things). If you would have gone to the wiki and saw the average TS price is 125 candles and saved up at least that much to be safe (because you wouldn't know who was coming until the reveal without the leak) you would have been fine. Plus the past THREE TS had props correct? So anticipating the tree nodes being moved around or prices changing isn't shocking. \n\nThe amount of people that were shitting on TGC for what was ultimately their own bad decision was crazy. Save at least 125 for the TS. Don't rely on illegal leaks and if you DO then save the exact amount the leak says and don't just pick and choose. I physically had to leave the general chat channel and just slide back into beta chat because of the amount of sheer bashing I saw on both tgc and people trying to defend tgc. Beta didn't even get jelly as a TS because there was a glitch and it's sunbather. And they aren't going to fix it. And we accepted it because we aren't priority and live is, but that still disappointing for us. Jelly was anticipated, but we aren't calling tgc horrible and the worst company ever. But over in live one node moves and then? Bam. It was immediate conspiracy theories and shit hits the fan harder than if they said they were deleting juggler from existence. They should have just CRd like normal and assumed whatever spirit that came would be around average price or higher. What's worse is that jelly is a relatively inexpensive spirit as the higher ones are 180-200 candles. I'd hate to see what it would have been like if it were fire prophet like everyone had been chanting for in the chat before the Tuesday reveal. People are nuts. TS come back and tgc may be a company but it's filled with actual people who read all the nasty stuff that was put into feedback that night.

Things are happening in games now that didn't happen 5 or 10 years ago, and there's been an increasing focus on giving part of an experience at the beginning only to sell the rest of it in chunks for payment where whole experiences may have once been offered instead. There's been a larger focus on the microtransaction, and all the headaches those entail. And seeing this happen again and again is wearing people down, and causing them to become jaded.\n\nI think people worry that, despite any contrasting evidence and a comparison to other game models on the market today, Sky might just become one of these kinds of games. I do think it's a valid concern, and that worry comes from a hope for Sky to not fit that mold and be something that can be enjoyed fondly and without bitterness.\n\nI do feel though that you are right about the levels of cynicism being above what I think the concern should be. I also joined at the beginning of the little prince season as a Switch player, so I also don't have the perspective that older players do.\n\n## Comment ID hmc5ne3 with +7 score by [(Naokli, Reddit, 2021-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/r3j1y8/sky_company_cynicism_is_disheartening/hmc5ne3/) (in reply to ID r3j1y8):\nI'm playing since two years now, I thinks since the game was officially released. I remember when it was the initial map and it was difficult to collect wax. When for the first few seasons there was no new maps, and the spirits were just in the initial ones. \n\nI was a solo player back then, I completed the game alone first. But I remember each time I made a new encounter or when people helped me to open gates or to do something.\n\nThe game is firstly about a journey. Meeting people, getting help or helping them. Getting new friends, enjoying the scenery and music... I know people can be bored to always visit the same area over and over again. It can be annoying sometimes I agree, but that's also what I like about this game. You don't need to rush and it fells like to be at home. You learn to know each places, but if you take times you still discover new things. Just enjoying a quiet place and the music or ambient sounds. Or just having fun in one of the central place and having fun with total strangers and befriend them or not.\n\nThe game don't put in your face in-game purchase. And having some cosmetics doesn't give any advantage over other players (except maybe for the capes giving you access to other specific areas of the game, but even there that's really not an advantage for what's there and since other players can be bring there). You can totally enjoy the full areas and adventure as a F2P player.  Cosmetics are just for the appearance of the character and nothing more. I can understand that some people may want some cosmetics that are under paywall. But the company still need to make profit (and that doesn't make them evil or greedy), but most of the time the cosmetics will come back with ts with time and candles so free access, and they can come back many times. So except some exclusive items that are being paywall, because people who put real money on the game deserve some exclusivity, you can have almost anything with a bit of patience.\n\nThe same with candles. It's much more easier nowadays to collect wax. In one hours I can have 15, and I don't do a full candle run. In the last past days I'm quite lazy or don't have the time or motivation for it, still through two realms I can get 10 candles. With the new seasons coming each times, come new candles and new opportunities to collect wax. They even add new in assembly season place recently. I know it can be annoying and troublesome sometimes to do a candle run, but it's really easy to find people to help with that on the discord or reddit. \n\nSame with the hearts, even if here I find some things maybe overpriced. Yet it's still easy to find places for people to trade if you search well.\n\nI think that since the released of the game many improvements were made to ease our way through the game. The chevrons, the additions of new areas with the seasons, the new candles, the option to ask for help to find spirits....\n\nThere is always place for improvement for sure. But I don't thing TDC is greedy or anything. And I happily support them with buying a pass for a season when I can and when I really like the items, to support them. They offer us an experience I think we can't find anywhere else. The season of the Little Prince brought back me many memories, just seeing him and the area with all the planets was a real happiness. And made me read again the book and some other associated with it. Sky is an experience, and some people may forget to just take the time to enjoy the game and relax, like enjoying the simple things of life.  Just some times take a break to enjoy the scenery or just talk with a stranger.\n\n## Comment ID hmbc2tv with +7 score by [(Powerful_Dream_711, Reddit, 2021-11-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/r3j1y8/sky_company_cynicism_is_disheartening/hmbc2tv/) (in reply to ID r3j1y8):\nI completely agree with you! People are being too picky and nagging on TGC, when it does need money, it's a **company** for gosh sake, they need to pay their employees, have offices, etc. etc.\n\nI'm always a f2p player, and this game is a lot better than some others that I've seen (COUGH COUGH EA, the memes are pretty true lol) and TGC tries to fix the bugs as soon as possible. TGC is not a perfect company, as there cannot be a perfect company, just like people. I've been playing since end of July this year, and all the prices on things are pretty reasonable. Sometimes seasons get a bit cheap with the f2p items, but you can still always get them when they come as TS. IAP's are now giftable, so people can't complain that they don't have money or don't want to spend on Sky. \n\nSometimes it can get a bit annoying with the TS and seasons, such as the chaos that happened with the sword pants, which were immediately followed by 2 of the most sought after and expensive TS, Crab Whisperer and Juggler, so TGC might've been pushing a *bit* for people to spend on candles. \n\nThe game has pretty smooth gameplay and a lot of nice people, and not a ton of toxicity like some *other* games (which I won't say lol). \n\nIt's not like TGC puts advantages or anything behind a paywall really, the only example that could be made could *maybe* be one of the ultimate gifts from (SPOILER SPOILER ALERT!) \n\n>!Season of abyss, which is the rebreather mask, which gives you a few more seconds of oxygen!<\n\nbut that's not much of an advantage really. Some cosmetics give you access to certain areas but there are many people who would be willing to take you themselves (Such as office or asteroid area from little prince season). On places like the discord and even reddit there are people willing to take you, so you can't complain!\n\nRunning a game and keeping it afloat for this long is a major task, and TGC is trying its best. Heck, it even got the game all the way to the switch! It could be a bit more transparent about some things like why it takes quite a lot of time to fix bugs sometimes, but they still get it fixed. TGC has to put prices on things in order to keep themselves afloat, but they aren't just complete greed and putting paywalls on things. \n\nSo, I ask to people complaining and hating on TGC,\n\n\"What would you do if you ran a company with hundreds of thousands of players? How would you pay your employees, keep quality of life within the game and your offices, and manage to make an enjoyable game that doesn't have a paywall in front of everything? How would you keep a game running for years, and manage to bring it to a console?\"\n\nThanks for your time!

The current 6-7 days a week is just way too much.  \n\nIt may or may not be intentional by TGC, but giving us such so few missable days per season does promote buying candles.  \n\nIf someone misses one too many days, their only choice is to buy candles or miss out on the final season reward.

That event is (personally) the one I remember being the first including a cosmetic tree based in in-game currency. This advanced a lot more in the last returning events, where cosmetics that were paid are returning to be bought with in-game currency. An example is the Ox mask from this year's Days of Fortune, in February. It costed money, and now it will be available for 55 candles (subject to change, because of the Beta nature).\n\nSomething that many people doesn't remember it's that; during the beta testing of the Season of Prophecy (more than a year back), TGC proposed that the  returning items from Traveling Spirits that were pass-only, would be pass only in the TS tree too. (https://discord.com/channels/575762611111592007/585611536358440960/761773434983546881)\nBut as you can assume, that idea never reached the Live version, because one thing that I admire, is the way TGC hear the community.\n\nAh, and of course, the cursed candle run. Gotta be honest; never, in my year-and-half of playing Sky, I did a complete candle run. I just completed Isle of Dawn. The max amount of candles I ever had were 118 and I don't do Eye of Eden weekly. And I will never do; it's not a way I would enjoy Sky.\nBefore Days of Bloom I was really broke always, and this helped me a bit, but I agree with you, they can add more variety of ways of getting wax.\n\n### Comment ID hme61ey with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/r3j1y8/sky_company_cynicism_is_disheartening/hme61ey/) (in reply to ID hmcwjoi):\nI remember that beta test, and the solution to have candle prices remain for f2p players while also making ts items free for pass owners seemed like an easy one.

And they’re the dev team on a mobile game, a popular one too.\nI think that a lot of decisions when it comes to the monetisation of the game are more predatory in nature, because they price things very very high compared to literally any other game’s real money cosmetic prices. I don’t feel like sky is the worst offender in the mobile games market by any means, but those exclusive IAPs are way too expensive.\n\nWhat I find so sad is the strange consumer urge for people to defend a company that has enough money to make better decisions. I’m not really against TGC, but I don’t get why so many people jump to defend developers as much as and as hard as they do. Aren’t people allowed to say that a price is too high, and that because it’s too high that’s the developers being greedy? There’s a lot of apologetics about the IAP prices, so much so that it feels like people are trying to convince themselves that it’s a fair price, or small little TGC just needs more support, when this isn’t the case.\nYou don’t really know the developers either, so why do you have to take everything they say with good faith?\n\n### Comment ID hme4pvv with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/r3j1y8/sky_company_cynicism_is_disheartening/hme4pvv/) (in reply to ID hmduntg):\nYou don't have to do much thinking to guess fair reasons why tgc overprices their iaps considering how they run their game compared to other \"f2p\" titles.

Sometimes when reaching the scaling stage (which TGC is going through) it can be important to have the conversation of: should the CEO step down and let new leadership come in? \n\nAt that point a CEO can choose whether to exit the company or take on a different role in the team that is more suited to their skillset. In that position the former CEO is less likely to wind up in a situation where the company is struggling to manage itself and less likely to wind up in a situation where they are fired by the board of directors. And yes, [company founders can get fired](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbescoachescouncil/2023/08/18/how-founders-can-avoid-the-fate-of-firing/) from the very company they founded - I wouldn't be surprised if Jenova Chen is in this position himself.\n\nStill, if you would like some information that further extrapolates on these reviews, I wrote this below in the leadership section (contained in another comment) (also please forgive me, I am autistic with a special interest in business stuff).\n\n#\n\n#### Comment ID lzx6hkd with +16 score by [(Afternoon-Melodic, Reddit, 2024-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1h42sgq/amidst_the_incompetence_of_tgc_fixing_bugs_i/lzx6hkd/) (in reply to ID lzvls9i):\nIt would take someone with emotional intelligence to step aside from that kind of role.

[Discovering SaaS](https://discoveringsaas.com/saas-structure/saas-org-chart-explained-examples/) suggests 200 straddles the line between the scaling stage and the established business stage and gives models of organizational structures for those stages. A well-defined organizational structure and roles are vital for a company’s stability and success. \n\nSome companies grow without properly developing their organizational structure which leads to the inability to delegate, scale with operations, follow a long-term vision and establish a chain of command for issues. TGC’s [GlassDoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-thatgame-EI_IE2130792.11,19.htm) page allows anonymous reviews from the employees and people who have interviewed for a position at TGC. A grain of salt should be taken for both positive and negative reviews as some companies may request certain employees give reviews and might hand-select the employees who are treated well and may wish to curry more favor with upper management, while negative reviews can sometimes be a grievance list from a disgruntled employee. Interview reviews may also be biased negatively if the reviewer was not given an offer. \n\nStill, in light of the fact that TGC has seemed to exhibit some operational trouble, I would like to give more credence to the negative reviews, while using the interview reviews as first impressions of the CEO.\n\n**Negative Employee Review**\n\nSo far, to date, there has only been one negative employee review which does not paint a very good picture of the leadership: (image of the negative review)\n\nThis one seems to be quite plausible given how tight the deadlines have been. Aside from the quarterly seasonal releases, there are micro-events that have been in a noticeable and consistent chain with little gaps noticeable since around June, 2024, and a period noticed around the end of August, 2024 where there were extreme server issues for a portion of the player base. [Crunch culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crunch_(video_games)) is common to the industry and it’s hard to believe that Sky would be an exception to the norm especially when upper management uses passion as the rhetoric to encourage long hours and a lack of work/life balance.\n\n**Positive Reviews**\n\nPositive reviews can also contain cons, some of which mention that live games are stressful and there’s plenty of moving goal posts. Another positive review mentions these cons (directly quoted):\n\n* Deadlines and scope can occasionally be intense\n* Sometimes too many meetings about what we are going to do rather than allocating time to just do it \n* Occasionally there is siloing, however it has been fairly rare in my experience\n\nMost of the pros of the positive review make mention of the people they work with, but the siloing comments are interesting. [Siloing](https://mailchimp.com/resources/working-in-silos/) is when employees in an organization are isolated from one another and do not work together, which can happen in in-person work places, but more likely to occur in remote environments.\n\n## Comment ID lzv95eh with +71 score by [(Zedetta, Reddit, 2024-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1h42sgq/amidst_the_incompetence_of_tgc_fixing_bugs_i/lzv95eh/) (in reply to ID 1h42sgq):\nSadly none of this is surprising with the way the company seems to operate\n\n## Comment ID lzw1ztw with +93 score by [(rhamantauri, Reddit, 2024-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1h42sgq/amidst_the_incompetence_of_tgc_fixing_bugs_i/lzw1ztw/) (in reply to ID 1h42sgq):\nThis is not the first time I’ve heard official mentions of Jenova Chen’s ego. \n\nWe got a dose of it first hand as he pandered lies to us in the [speech on toxicity](https://youtu.be/VXTMG0qeJqk?si=tTDPsFL4TZpbVFF4) at SkyFest this year. \n\nIn this speech, he claims to have written the book on emotionally impactful games without violence, which according to him, didn’t exist before he came along. He then goes on to compare his playerbase as essentially “babies”, who for some reason have “shotguns” with which negativity can then be used to “shoot each other in the face”. \n\nHe then explains how basically, the community is what eventually convinced him to allow bugs (OOB, white candle, rocket, etc) in his game that he initially wanted to make entirely bugless because he wanted it to remain as contained as possible. If it weren’t for the backlash in the early years of Sky, we wouldn’t have OOB areas today, which now the team actively maintains for us. \n\nHe goes on to discuss the company’s no-feedback approach to feedback when it comes to players sharing their game experiences with the company. That if a “crying baby” has negativity to share, ignore, don’t provide positive or negative feedback and just let them calm down. Which absolutely explains how TGC feels like a presence that is barely there. \n\nHe also all but promised candle runs would become less tedious and time consuming, and the opposite has happened. \n\nYou can watch this for yourself as he recites this grand illusion of a toxic-free sky, while completely ignoring the fact that a whole network of currency trade exists that violates ToS just to deal with how crushing the grind is (heart trades), shared space frustrations, and the egregious state of the game where now you can’t even move a few feet before it breaks. \n\nIn this video, Jenova Chen demonstrates how fantastically he is no longer qualified to be at the helm of this company. While I appreciate his vision, it is because of the people under him that I got to experience anything at all, not him. \n\nIf he could step down in a capacity that still allowed him freedoms of his own IP, be involved but let someone who can operationally run things smoother, I think the game would probably improve the daily player experience. Maybe the repeated failures due to simply meeting deadlines will wake up upper management, but the way things have been going it doesn’t seem like that is even probable. \n\nI’m glad this post was made and that Jenova Chen’s behavior at an operational standpoint is being called out. Someone who respects their team and their team’s vision and input, someone who communicates with their players and team, someone who can see Sky for what it is…that is who TGC needs steering this ship.\n\n### Comment ID lzwycgm with +39 score by [(Independent-Rip-6391, Reddit, 2024-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1h42sgq/amidst_the_incompetence_of_tgc_fixing_bugs_i/lzwycgm/) (in reply to ID lzw1ztw):\nIf Jenova is gonna compare the fandom to babies, then he needs to use this five word phrase: A baby cannot be spoiled.\n\nIn other words, if a baby is crying they need something.

This is also a very cherry picked set of reviews, all but one by people who didn't get an offer. I'm not saying there aren't problems at TGC, just saying beware confirmation bias.\n\n### Comment ID lzy7olf with +13 score by [(rainy-lavender888, Reddit, 2024-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1h42sgq/amidst_the_incompetence_of_tgc_fixing_bugs_i/lzy7olf/) (in reply to ID lzw2eb0):\nI've used Glassdoor plenty over the years including while working at smaller companies. Yes confirmation bias is a thing. if you read one negative thing, you'll be more likely to pick up on it in your own interview and maybe write it again in a new review.\n\nbut honestly, i'm far more likely to believe any employee including potential speaking on their POV than what a company says to me. they are the ones in power given interviews to people in a rough job economy. the employees have more to lose by speaking their truth. if some of it was confirmation bias, then fine, but they felt a bad vibe when they see it. it's really just how much of it you're willing to stomach for a paycheck and if people already wanna get outta here at the interview stage with the ceo, that's concerning for employees and players of the company.\n\n### Comment ID lzwl4gd with +16 score by [(Lothloriana, Reddit, 2024-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1h42sgq/amidst_the_incompetence_of_tgc_fixing_bugs_i/lzwl4gd/) (in reply to ID lzw2eb0):\nI saw another comment here compilating the positive feedbacks, showing those interesting negative points even in the positive feedbacks\n\n#### Comment ID lzxz220 with +6 score by [(coradek, Reddit, 2024-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1h42sgq/amidst_the_incompetence_of_tgc_fixing_bugs_i/lzxz220/) (in reply to ID lzwl4gd):\nEverything on glassdoor (positive and negative) is about 30 reviews. I'm not discounting their experience, but glassdoor is known to be frequently biased, especially for small companies. Just pointing out it's not necessarily balanced.\n\n### Comment ID lzwbwc6 with +8 score by [(Hot_Drummer_6679, Reddit, 2024-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1h42sgq/amidst_the_incompetence_of_tgc_fixing_bugs_i/lzwbwc6/) (in reply to ID lzw2eb0):\nYeah, it's something to weigh in both directions. Of the employee reviews only one scored negative, and bias can be read from interview reviews if someone didn't get the offer. I think in spite of the bias they do offer some interesting information and there's some grains of truth if you can see a pattern among them (for example, several interviewees mentioned the CEO feeling rude, and I doubt they conspired to give similar feedback).\n\nBut I think there's a lot of angles to all of this and GlassDoor is only offering one. If you want to approach the topic of TGC and Jenova Chen with the idea that you are fed up with the direction of the company you can definitely go through resources like this, but if you want to simply be curious and see more angles I would suggest also reading wiki articles, checking out their glass door, and finding news and press releases (some of these will also be biased favorably, but I do feel like only focusing on biased unfavorably can be a drawback).\n\nNot that anyone particularly *needs* to research or make a balanced review of the company, game, and Jenova Chen, but I have found it a bit more rewarding to read around about the company and industry, focus on curiosity and come from the perspective of someone who has no stakes in the matter (as in whether the company fails or succeeds has no bearing on my livelihood or finances). \n\nI can't blame anyone who has developed an intense emotional stake in the game and are sort of mourning what it used to be and trying to find some reason or narrative that lead to it.\n\n## Comment ID lzve64z with +30 score by [(FarAwayConfusion, Reddit, 2024-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1h42sgq/amidst_the_incompetence_of_tgc_fixing_bugs_i/lzve64z/) (in reply to ID 1h42sgq):\nIs this a surprise to anybody?\n\n### Comment ID lzvlleb with +34 score by [(lithigos, Reddit, 2024-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyGame/comments/1h42sgq/amidst_the_incompetence_of_tgc_fixing_bugs_i/lzvlleb/) (in reply to ID lzve64z):\nMaybe not a surprise but I guess I wasn't expecting it to be quite that bad.

Always got separated with my friends in the middle of candle run because of this. edit: also sometimes the game force closed and when i back, i always alone with no other player. It doesn't affect much but in some place like prairie and vault that need 2 person to open the gates. Overall the game design is good but the server is buggy and got many problems",

          "content": "Sky is a cute, fun and calming game, I have had many wonderful experiences playing it with my friends over the years. However, I just can’t recommend the game in its current state. I am writing this review to call attention to problems that need addressing. Buckle in this is a long one\n\nFirst- Sky is absolutely falling apart with glitches. Every update this past year has caused the game to break down in some type of way; mass server disconnections, the appearance of your progress being erased, quests breaking, unusable features, and even one that’s happening right now- a glitch that causes the daily candle timer to repeatedly reset, breaking player character animations and softlocking your in-game currency collection.\nAnother very bad glitch was one that caused the screen to strobe flash in an area, which posed danger for those with epilepsy. This did not get fixed for over a month. It’s common for glitches in Sky to go without being fixed for lengthy periods of time, despite the community’s constant reports. I cannot understand how these issues continue to happen, and can only hope more systems are implemented to fix their code and prevent against such glitches.\n\nAlso, it’s a fact that hundreds of live-service games regularly gift their communities premium currency as an apology for glitches, or to show respect for sticking with them through the process of planned maintenance. I can only remember Sky doing this once, and it was after a huge outcry by the community some months ago after the game was in an unplayable state for a week. Something so common in other games is strangely not a regular habit here. It becomes more upsetting when you consider how Sky events & items are limited-time, that a large number of players are paying customers, and players must make effort every day farming candles to get the fun items they want before it’s gone. If something out of the player’s control prevents them from playing the game, there is often no compensation for what was lost. And if there is, it’s inadequate. A measly 15 candles + extending farming events (which serves to make players log in and work to earn themselves more of what they lost out on, through no fault of their own) after a week of the game being unplayable isn’t very fair. The community often accuses the company of being stingy and asks why they can’t show more goodwill. One of many reasons why players feel disconnected with the company.\n\nContinuing on that, yes a core gameplay of Sky is to collect candles, in-game currency used to purchase equipment and outfits. But more things seem to be getting changed which inconvenience the player with this. Player-created solutions to the repetitive farming get suddenly changed like locations for AFK idle light, or the controversial recent Grandma’s Table shared space removal. Harmless well-known strategies that help all players are patched out for unexplained reasons which makes people upset, and there is no “proper” alternative to those that’s offered. Events happen simultaneously which makes it difficult to save up candles and causes burnout from farming. Yet candles, cosmetics and more items are continually offered as expensive in-app purchases to buy with your real money.\n\nIt feels like the company doesn’t know what players want. The playerbase is stretched for their time, money, and feels like they are made to constantly experience FOMO. Of course, that is if they can play at all with the glitches.\n\nMany of my friends stopped playing in the last year, and I am likely soon to follow. Sky is such a beautiful, unique and relaxing game for me, but its state now is unfortunate. \nDevelopers- if you read this, I sincerely hope this serves as constructive criticism for you. I would truly love if the game and your treatment to players can improve in the future & encourage me and many others to return someday.",

I don't know why people are such weirdos over the app. I love it٫ and reccomend it for everyone. The characters  are very well detailed٫ and I love how good their made. The reason why I think everyone should have it is because theres no adds! I love how its a smooth game٫ and no stops for adds. One thing I recommend adding is names. I havent played the full game٫ so I dont know if you can add names. But i would love to name my friends! I hope for an update soon! But thats not a problem!

          "content": "Been playing 4 years. Since 2023ish many base functionality bugs keep reverting back, over n over. Terrible panning n zoom , 5/15 candles counted, lag that has nada to do with wifi (it's their servers). Rn? Handhold is silly broken again - a bug from 4 years ago replicated  at least 3 times since.  The bugs used to be funny but since they added FestWjat after aurora season and focusing more on  PC/steam, basic play has become so bugged that everyone is annoyed. The oldest players just gone now cuz it's frustrating to watch basics decline while they pump out more and more glittery prop.  \nOne major issue (if a long term player), is the friendship constellation where we can join friends who are online. It has been broken for OVER 2 YEARS - often, your besties will appear offline you if you log in before them and vise verse. The game isn't updating logins anymore. So if you log in after your other bestie has a;ready logged in, they won't see as being online in the home constellation. And you either get sad or force restart about 10 times til they finally show up.  So often I'll log in same time with my bff (pre- arranged off-game to meet up) and neither of us can see us being online even though we are in the same server. No biggie til you split 10 mins later and can't tp back. So.  Restart restart restart til one of us can find the other. But this is an on-going issue with so many of my friends who have played at leas years. Ppl without full constellation don't seem to have this prob as bad. \nAlso, be careful with chat - autocorrect vs AI censoring has gone crazy, very easy to be muted for 60 minutes foraying something basic like Hel lo or halo or HELLO. \nAll complaining aside,  Sky is an incredible game w/ an amazing community of ppl - it's really the friends we've made that keeps us oldies coming back so when chat or netting is so broken, it's a big deal . But tgc doesn't care about veterans lately, so idk.  Also? The Vanilla-icing aspect lately for kiddos is making this once very deep, sometimes dark game, feel cheesy n vanilla. Kids were rare when most of us started playing - in fact it was super uncommon for people to even ask ages or genders. New players all wanna unlock chat in a minute but not everyone wants chat unlock via qr. but feel guilty not accepting. \n\nThanks for the wonderful moments. I play because of my friends. But they're leaving because they'd appreciate less fluff and more depth again, lore!!! And some major challenge again like prophecy gave and krills. But it's also cuz of the heat overload sky has on mobiles np less than 2 years old - heatsink n  cpu/ on mobiles is burning batteries harder than 3 Genshins at once since pc/steam landed. Fix it!",

          "content": "This game is amazing! The graphics and storyline are on point, and this is one of the most safe online games I have ever encountered. In order to talk to another player you need to use candles to friend them, and then pay another candle for the chatting button. You can’t communicate while your friend is offline, either. You also can’t send a message for everyone to see, only your friends can see what you have typed. This makes the game a LOT more safe for kids. Being unable to widely broadcast a message will keep tons of people off of scam websites and away from gross adults. There is also a way to block other players, which is extremely helpful for safety. The storyline of the game is somewhat unclear, and it allows for the player to come up with their own ideas. I’ve played for years, and I’ve never been bored. Love you, Sky COTL <3",

Since then I have spent over $1k of real money and have been trying to find a way to strike against this app and get my money back so I can delete the game completely for I no longer want to continue investing into a game filled with glitches, Server drops, AI muting players for saying simple words that do not go against terms guide lines, not being able to successfully candle run due to glitches in game that can lose you out of 200+ candles a month (ex: grandma event not working for an entire month) and WITH TODAYS & YESTERDAYS SAME GLITCH OF daily refresh/ refresh of entire soul MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO EVEN PLAY. I want a complete refund, delete my account sky. You have proven to me that my 1k in 5 months has not invested in proper coding techniques nor the fact that this game is clearly not ready to be taking real money in general. Due to always feeling like everything will be fixed and my game play experience will go smoothly- I have been investing my own money to help the cause and to also make sure I am not losing out of candles while TGC are still putting out travel spirits, events and seasons around the same time with items costing no less than 9.99 (real money) and items that cost in game candles anywhere from 50-300 while only being able to get 22 candles a day max (you can only reach this is if you have 3+ hours to spend everyday). I am aware that we do not have to buy every item, though it is not fair when the game glitches to the point of not being able to receive the full amount of candles everyday. Not only that but you have to wait a year to even see if the same spirits/events/ seasons/ travel spirits will come if you miss an item… this is how they catch you and where the addiction starts. Enough of your games TGC. Please REFUND ME EVERY OUNCE OF MY MONEY. It is not our fault you are in debt due to the beginnings of the run of your app having failed in numbers and probably having to pay AURORA back. Stop using glitches as a reason your created addicts (once fans) use in game purchases for candles and items. This is sick and disturbing. You can find and ban hackers in a day that actually help people candle run and are the Robin Hood’s of this game during your glitches, but it takes a month for you to fix your glitches to increase your chances of in game purchases?!? You guys can’t even compensate for these huge in game mistakes?! STOP THIS OR THIS GAME WILL NO LONGER EXIST TGC!!! Please, for your fans that truly love what you have created, like I did. I was enjoying funding something as beautiful as you have created. But now you give me no choice for It has become greedy and unjust.",

          "content": "I totally love this game, but there are a few things :\n1. Bug: try to deep call but flaps wings at the same time.\nThis problem didn’t even exist before, but one day, I was playing the game, and I try to deep call and I long press my character, I did long call, but I also flapped twice… pls fix this!\n2. Suggestion #1: the furniture! They’re. Too. Expensive. \nI mean, WHAT? 24 hearts for A BED? And to get another one I have to use ANOTHER 24 HEARTS?! You’ve gotta be kidding! 10 hearts for a shelf is… alright I guess. But why do I have to spend another 10 hearts for another one?! And the seashell music player needs 33 ASCENDED CANDLES?! FOR A MUSIC PLAYER?!! I could never :( . What’s more, lots of other furniture need a lot of ASCENDED CANDLES!! Seriously.😐. THE. FURNITURE. IS. TOO. EXPENSIVE. Pls fix this.\n3. Suggestion #2: Aviary entrance pole.\nWhere did it go? On a roof 😑. Plz put it back to the aviary entrance! I looks better there.\n4. Suggestion #3: Furniture sales.\nCan I sell the furniture I don’t want at the nesting workshop? That way I can earn candles and hearts without having to go through SOOO much trouble trying to buy A BED. If I can’t sell them, I should be able to trade them. Sky: The children of light is like living in a fantasy, magical life, so players should be able to sell and trade stuff, instead of just buying them. Helping spirits and completing quests given by them is a huge improvement, but I really think you should add this, lots of players would like that, I’m sure.\n5. Suggestion #4: Add more creatures?\nI was thinking, if there are dark dragons, maybe add some light dragons?\n6. Suggestion #5: Companion? Maybe?\nMaybe let players have animal companions? Like, not pets, but helps and follows players, or will arrive when called? That would be nice. Just a suggestion though.\n7. Suggestion #6: Nests\nOur nests are nice, but maybe expand them a bit, we have a small balcony, a room, a few windows and a doorway, but maybe separate our nests into three rooms? Like, a main room, where we enter, a slightly smaller room, and a slightly larger room. No need to change the balcony though. \nThat’s all. I hope you read my suggestions, and help with my bug, and I hope you’ll put them in the game. Otherwise, the game is amazing. Love it.",

The currency has been glitching and either not loading in, or taking ungodly amount of time to load in. The shard event happens to be completed every single server I jump to, no matter how early I am to the event. And eventually after a while, the game gets repetitive. Also I myself agree with the countless complaints i’ve heard/read about being a long term player having to go through the same long routes just to get where you’re trying to go in whatever realm you are in. I think there should at least be checkpoints to teleport to when you are not grinding for currency in the game.",

The iaps are ridiculously priced (there is no justification for $20 for ONE cosmetic item, which seems to be a recurring issue.)

          "content": "alright , this isn’t a recipe blog — i’ll do the reasons first and the personal story last. 1) sky is a social game, and while in some cases a brief interaction may be necessary, around 60% of the time it isn’t — and you can make people get a notification that you don’t want to be around people right now before they teleport to you or try to interact. 2) sky isn’t difficult. i’m a casual gamer who hasn’t played a true fighting game since around 2021, so you can imagine i’m not good at fighting games — and the only real enemies in this game are so easy to get past that i antagonize them for fun. and if you get hit? unless you somehow glitched there with only one winged light, it’s fairly easy to get your wl back. 3) i’ve had one semi-rude encounter in my roughly two years of playing sky. most people are infinitely kind, because the game actively nurtures that. friendly fire is near impossible, because someone has to not only actively place you in the line of a dark dragon, you also have to be new enough to not reach cover — which , by the way, is everywhere. like. seriously. it’s near impossible to get friendly fired, and most people are nice enough to not try unless they’re a Really close friend and they know you’re kind enough to find it funny. 4) the diversity on this app is insane. i learned a second language because of this game. i know people from poland, japan, china, south korea, the philippines — all because of this game. you’ll learn things you never knew. 5) it’s not pay to win. (also, other people can gift you the few items that cost real money.) no item that costs you real money will actually make progression easier, it’s all aesthetic items like clothes, instruments, or decorations. alright, i think that should tie up the logical stuff. now, let’s go on to my personal story with sky. // tw ; suicide, an abusive parent, mention of alcoholism. hi, i’m shrike. in 2021-22, i was depressed and living half with my alcoholic, emotionally abusive mother. i was depressed, exhausted, and barely coping. enter sky. a week into playing, i met hanna and yuri — from poland and italy respectively. i knew them as sixlets and beetle, because i had just nicknamed them after the first things to enter my head. we got along easily. i was a new player, and they were experienced and happy to guide me along. they only half knew what was going on — i wasn’t the kind of person to bother with telling them — but they were so kind and so considerate. when would make little comments about “ha yeah, my mom and sister are fighting rn, sorry if i type slow,” it was immediately virtual hugs and kindness. another friend who’s incredibly dear to me, cal, who is from the philippines. cal talked me down from suicide — i was about to overdose on my own medication, because of my situation. after that, if they were online i was online, and we never really seperated. my mom got drunk at a party and my sister had to drive us home, before she had her license, at one am. cal was my comfort, and they were so kind to me no matter what. and then the day after my mom got drunk, i got out. i was close to killing myself — but i got out of there and have been living with my dad since. i remember telling cal that i had gotten out , and i healed with them at my side. i’m still in therapy. i’m still recovering, and still unpacking what happened to me — but we were friends through it all. download sky. it got me through so much. even if you’re not doing as bad as i was, you’ll find yourself a happier person.",

But it’s hard to get hearts I usually have two because i completed all the quests from spirits so maybe if we do all the daily tasks we can get one heart🌸",

      "# [Thatgamecompany by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2006-09-23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thatgamecompany)\nAmerican video game developer\n\nThatgamecompany, Inc. (stylized as thatgamecompany) is an American independent video game development company founded by University of Southern California students Jenova Chen and Kellee Santiago in 2006. The company was a developer for Sony Computer Entertainment, contracted to create three downloadable games for the PlayStation 3's PlayStation Network service, and has since secured independent funding. The first of their games is a remake of Chen's award-winning Flash title Flow, with enhanced visuals and sound, added multiplayer modes and compatibility with the PlayStation 3's motion-sensitive controller. The title was released on the PlayStation Store in 2007. The company's second PlayStation 3 game, Flower, was released on the PlayStation Store in 2009, and their third game, Journey, was released in March 2012 on the PlayStation Store. Their fourth game, Sky: Children of the Light, was released in July 2019 on iOS and in April 2020 on Android. Later, it released on the Nintendo Switch in June 2021 and on PlayStation 4 in December 2022.\n\nAccording to Chen, the company focuses on creating video games that provoke emotional responses from players. He has stated that, while the company is not opposed to making action-oriented games, he believes that enough such titles are released by the established video game industry. When designing a game, Chen and Thatgamecompany's process is to start by mapping out what the game should make the player feel, rather than by establishing game mechanics. Chen has stated that the company does not plan to produce large, blockbuster titles, due to their belief that the pressure for high sales would stifle innovation.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn late 2005, Jenova Chen and Kellee Santiago began thinking about creating their own video game company. The two were in their final year as master's students in the Interactive Media Program at the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts, and had just released a video game—Cloud—that they had developed with several other students.[1] The group intended the project as an experiment, meant to reveal whether they could create a game that \"expressed something different than video games had in the past\", and to determine the public's level of interest in video games of that nature.[2] Due to the game's strongly positive reception, Chen and Santiago began to consider founding their own company, so that they could continue making games like Cloud—in which the design is not based on gameplay mechanics, but on inspiring emotions in players—after they left college.[1]\n\nAt the time, digital distribution was gaining popularity. The two saw it as an opportunity to create games without the high financial risk of retail distribution, which they believed would require them to first accumulate funds by working for other video game companies.[1] Thatgamecompany was founded on May 15, 2006, as Chen and Santiago finished their master's degrees.[3][4] The company soon signed a deal with Sony Computer Entertainment, which had been impressed by Chen's Flash game Flow—a component of his master's thesis at USC. Thatgamecompany was contracted to produce three games for the upcoming PlayStation Network distribution system and was given startup funding and a location at Sony's offices in Los Angeles.[5]\n\nInitially, Thatgamecompany consisted of Chen, Santiago, Nick Clark, who had collaborated with Chen on Flow, and John Edwards. Santiago was the president of the company and the producer for its games, Clark was the designer, and Edwards was the lead engineer.[6] Although Chen cofounded the company, he initially worked at Maxis on the game Spore.[5] The company considered adapting Cloud as their first product for Sony, but instead decided on Flow, as it was \"more fleshed-out as a design\". They felt that it would be easier than Cloud to develop while they built the company; no members of the team had experience with managing a business or with creating a commercial game.[1] Several contract workers assisted Thatgamecompany with Flow's development, including Austin Wintory, the game's composer.[5][6]\n\nThe company had believed that the PlayStation 3 version of Flow could be completed in four months and that it would be ready for the November 2006 launch of the PlayStation Network. However, when it was released in February 2007, it did not include \"half of the original design\".[7] According to Santiago, the Sony producer assigned to the team had anticipated that they would underestimate the game's development length, and was not surprised by the delay.[1] The game was well received; it became the most downloaded game on the PlayStation Network in 2007, and was nominated for the Best Downloadable Game of the Year award at the 2008 Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Interactive Achievement Awards, and for the Best Innovation award at the 2007 British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) awards.[8][9][10] After its release, an expansion pack and a PlayStation Portable version of the game were created by SuperVillain Studios. Thatgamecompany was not involved in the development of either project beyond ensuring that they retained the same design and art direction as the original, as they were busy creating their next title, Flower.[7]\n\nFlower was Thatgamecompany's \"first game outside the safety net of academia\", according to Santiago.[11] Six to nine people were involved at different stages of development. Chen returned to work full-time at the company prior to the game's development and served as the creative director.[12] The game's music was composed by Vincent Diamante, who had worked with Chen and Santiago on Cloud.[13] The game was developed for two years, but the team spent three-fourths of that time in the prototyping stage. After they decided on the game's elements, Flower was produced in only six months.[14] Like Flow, the game was well received when it was released in February 2009, selling in the top ten PlayStation Network titles of the year and garnering several awards.[14][15] After the release of Flower, Thatgamecompany moved into their own building in Los Angeles.[14]\n\nThe company's third project was Journey, which was released on March 13, 2012. It was the final game in Thatgamecompany's three-game contract with Sony and was developed by a team of fourteen.[16] This team did not include Santiago, who, in order to concentrate on her role as the company's president, was replaced as a producer by Robin Hunicke.[17] The game was in development for three years, despite having been expected to take one year, and the development team faced several problems in expanding the company from seven employees as they began the game to eighteen, and risked running out of money.[18][19] Upon release, the game achieved both critical and commercial success.[20] It became the fastest-selling game to date on PlayStation Store in North America and Europe.[21] After the game was released, as the company began work on another project, several employees left for other opportunities. Santiago left the company to pursue other ventures, designer Chris Bell left to form his own studio The Willderness, and Hunicke resigned to work at Tiny Speck.[22][23] Chen attributes the exodus to the end of Thatgamecompany's three-game contract, and to the fact that the company had run out of money, mandating an unpaid hiatus to all employees until the revenue from Journey came in.[24]\n\nOnce the money from Journey began to arrive, Thatgamecompany brought back several of the employees affected by the cash flow problems, and some new developers.[24] The company, with its contract with Sony complete, raised $5.5 million in venture capital funding, which they hope to use to develop future games for multiple platforms without influences by publishers.[25] The team then began working on what would become Sky: Children of the Light, and as of June 2013 was made up of around 12 people, only half of whom worked on Journey. Thatgamecompany hoped to release the game on \"as many platforms as possible\", and to include touch controls in an innovative way in the same way their previous games included tilting the controller.[24] On May 27, 2014, it was reported that the game had received $7 million in funding from Capital Today and a team of other investors.[26] While Sky was in development, Thatgamecompany re-released Flow and Flower onto both the PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation Vita,[27] and released an updated port of Journey for the PlayStation 4.[28] Sky, a free-to-play multiplayer adventure game, was first released on July 18, 2019. Since its release, thatgamecompany has focused on supporting it.\n\nIn March 2020, Thatgamecompany announced plans to open a second studio in the San Francisco and Silicon Valley area in 2020, primarily to support Sky; these plans were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[29] In March 2022, it announced that it had received a $160 million investment and had taken on Pixar co-founder Edwin Catmull as an advisor.[30] Chen also announced that the studio was working on their fifth game, which he described as \"like a theme park\" and \"the most ambitious game I have built\".[31]\n\nPhilosophy\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen Thatgamecompany designs a game, they begin by deciding on the emotions and feelings they wish to invoke in the player. This differs from the approach of most developers, who build from game mechanics or genre features. According to Santiago, the company creates emotional responses to demonstrate the wide range of possible experiences in video games, which she believes is larger than the few—excitement and fear, for example—that are typically presented.[32] Chen has said that the company's games are meant to evoke emotions more than a message; he specifically changed the design of Flower when early testers felt that the game promoted green energy. Chen believes that he is \"too young\" to make a game with a strong message, and so designs the company's products to avoid overt meanings.[33] Santiago has said that Thatgamecompany's goal is \"to create games that push the boundaries of videogames as a communicative medium, and to create games that appeal to a wide variety of people\". She hopes to change the video game industry with this process, so that other companies approach video games as a \"creative medium\" instead of a mass product.[34]\n\nThatgamecompany's employees are not opposed to making action titles, and, as a break from their regular projects, have internally created \"exciting\" games that were well received by Sony. However, Chen believes that there is no reason for the company to commercially produce such games, as they would not be creating new ideas that justified the cost of remaining an independent studio, as opposed to working for existing game developers.[7] Similarly, Chen does not intend for Thatgamecompany to make \"big budget blockbuster games\", as he believes that the financial pressure would stifle innovation.[35]\n\nGames\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Flow, the player navigates a series of two-dimensional planes with an aquatic microorganism that evolves by consuming other microorganisms.[36] The game's design is based on Chen's research into dynamic difficulty adjustment at the University of Southern California, and on psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's theoretical concept of mental immersion or flow.[37][38] It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 22, 2007.\n\nFlower was intended as a spiritual successor to Flow. Using the PlayStation 3's motion-sensitive controller, the player controls wind that blows a flower petal through the air. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing vibrant color to previously dead fields or activating stationary windmills. The game features no text or dialogue, forming a narrative arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues.[40] It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 12, 2009.\n\nIn Journey, the player controls a robed figure who wakes up in a desert, with a large mountain in the distance as their destination. While traveling, the player can encounter other players over the Internet, one at a time. Players cannot communicate verbally, but may help each other or not as they wish.[32] The game was released for the PlayStation 3 on March 13, 2012. Austin Wintory was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2013 for Best Score Soundtrack for Journey, the first such nomination for a full video game score, but lost to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. It was released on Windows in 2019.[43]\n\nSky: Children of the Light is Thatgamecompany's latest game, released for iOS on July 18, 2019, and on Android on April 7, 2020,[44] is intended as a spiritual successor to all of their previous games. In Sky, the player explores a magical kingdom using a cape that gives them the ability to fly. Players play alongside millions of other players, connected via the internet. There are seven unique realms to explore, and each one is themed around a different stage of life. In addition to these realms, there is a Home that serves as a hub between the different realms. Throughout the game, the player will encounter \"spirits\" that give the player cosmetic and gameplay-affecting items in return for in-game currency. Sky is a free-to-play game, with cosmetic items and in-game currency available for purchase as microtransactions. Sky was chosen as Apple's iPhone Game of the Year in 2019, and reached 100 million installations in May 2021.[45][46] It was released on the Nintendo Switch in 2021, and released to the PlayStation 4 on December 6, 2022.[47] On October 9th, 2023, the game received a full PC demo for the October Steam Next Fest event.[48]\n\nGames Title Year Publisher(s) Platform(s) PS3 PS4 PSP PS Vita iOS Android Windows Switch Flow 2006 Sony Interactive Entertainment Yes Yes Yes Yes No No Yes No Flower 2009 Sony Interactive Entertainment\n\nAnnapurna Interactive (iOS and PC) Yes Yes No Yes Yes No Yes No Journey 2012 Sony Interactive Entertainment\n\nAnnapurna Interactive (iOS and PC) Yes Yes No No Yes No Yes No Sky: Children of the Light 2019 Thatgamecompany No Yes No No Yes Yes Yes Yes\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nVideo games portal\n\nCalifornia portal\n\nCompanies portal",
      "# [Sky Cape Crochet Pattern](https://www.thatskygame.com/news/sky-crochet-cape/)\nHey everyone my name is Chelsea! During the day I work with the Player Safety crew at thatgamecompany, and in my free time, I enjoy playing Sky and crocheting (although rarely at the same time).\n\nThis pattern was cobbled together from several different pre-existing patterns scoured from the internet, but none of which I own, so please find the pattern owners linked below. I hold much gratitude to the people who originally created the forms I’ve compiled here. I do not have any affiliation or make any profits from any of these instructions or recommendations.\n\nIt’s by the grace of the Elder Spirits that this cape came out even vaguely similar to what I set out to achieve, and I hope these instructions will allow my fellow Sky kids to craft their capes!\n\n(Disclaimer: Sky capes do not convey the ability to fly. If you feel you must try flying, make sure you attempt to take off from the level ground. Otherwise, good luck, and keep in mind the immortal words of Douglas Adams: “Just throw yourself at the ground and miss”.)\n\nLet's get started\n\nThe cape is made out of these main parts:\n\nThe granny square spine: 5 squares\n\nThe two sides/wings of the cape: 2 halves\n\nThree triangles: two to form the shoulders and connect the spine with the wings, and one for the middle tail at the bottom of the spine\n\nSix smaller regular granny squares (3 each) to even out the neckline and the space between the spine and the tail triangle.\n\nLotus Yarns \"Sky Blue\" is the main yarn I chose to use because it was as close as I could find online to TGC Blue. Feel free to use any type or color of yarn you wish!\n\nI generally go by feel as to what size hook I ought to use for a project, but I specifically chose a larger hook even though the yarn was relatively thin, so as to introduce a little more air and drape. The cape ended up being fairly weighty, so please consider that when choosing your yarn!\n\nThe spine/star granny squares are an adaptation of the Northern Diamond Square by @torunjcrochet.\n\nYou can find it for free posted here on Ravelry: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/northern-diamond-square\n\nI chose a bright white for the stars. I recommend that you carry the white and blue yarn under each other during the construction of the squares, as opposed to cutting your yarn during each color change, to ensure structural integrity and avoid creating several loose ends to weave in when securing the square.\n\nI found that when I created the star shape with five white stitches on each side on the second layer from the center (above), rather than three (below), the shape was more easily identifiable from a distance and looked better to me.\n\nI highly recommend blocking your squares before stitching them together—I used single crochet to stitch them together. I found that stitching the spine-star squares together on the \"wrong\" side (opposite of the external star detail) made the \"right\" side look cleaner.\n\nAfter you’ve stitched five star-squares together, I recommend going around the entire rectangle with either a single crochet or a half-double crochet to ensure all the squares stay put.\n\nThe two wing halves are from this site: https://wilmade.com/such-simple-shawl/\n\nEssentially, most triangle cape or shawl patterns can be adapted to create each of the two halves of the cape. I liked the above-mentioned pattern specifically because it was easy to distinguish how many rows I’d crocheted since they alternate in opacity, it’s just a little more dramatic-looking.\n\nAs long as you have two roughly-triangle shaped halves, or quadrangles in the case of the link above, it should look like a cape once you’ve attached everything together.\n\nI had no idea how big this was going to get after it was blocked out, so I recommend draping the wing of the cape against your side every few rows to get an idea of when to stop.\n\nYou can find a pattern for the triangles on YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=i1Nfup0iksU\n\nAnd a slew of basic granny square patterns for the smaller squares here: https://www.craftpassion.com/crochet-solid-granny-square-pattern/\n\nI free-handed the shredded/flap bits on each side.\n\nCounting out eight per half of the cape cuts the bottom into three (1-3) and the top side into five (4-8), which matches up with the cape’s in-game appearance.\n\nThese were measured by counting edge stitches and dividing them roughly equal-sized into three sections for the bottom half, and into four sections for the top half, then dividing the top-most section of the top half in half again, becoming sections 7 and 8.\n\nEssentially, start from the middle (closest to the spine), and work your way back and forth, flipping your work a few times, until the flap is approximately the size you think matches with your cape ratios. Mine were all about four rows tall.\n\nThen, single-crochet up the edge of the flap to start the process again for the next flap, until you reach the end or top-most of the cape. This part of the process was most easily done for me once all the pieces were pretty much stitched together, to make sure I had everything in the correct orientation for the final flourishes.\n\nTowards the end, everything gets a border of half double crochet and single crochet, to ensure nothing falls apart! I went around a few extra times, just for security and to call it finished.\n\nI hope this documentation is enough to start you on your journey, and I hope to see you all eventually posting your wonderful crochet cape creations!\n\nI truly could not have ever anticipated the incredible response of our community when my cape creation was posted, and I am humbled and grateful that all of you fine folk were immediately looking for a pattern. Please make sure to tag us (@thatskygame) so I can see all of them and be inspired by your work!\n\n— Chelsea",

There’s plenty to dive into with this update: the conclusion of Ninny’s story in Season of Moomin, surprising twists in a special year-end collaboration, big updates for Days of Music, and another round of feature updates and quality of life improvements that we can’t wait to share—among MANY other things.\n\nSeason of Moomin Continues\n\nMore chapters of Season of Moomin are waiting for you to explore! As the remaining quests become available, check in with the Storybook Guide to experience the rest of this classic tale alongside Moominmama, Too-ticky, and Little My—not to mention Ninny and the rest of the Moomin family.\n\nWhile the Season continues, be sure to unlock themed hairstyles, capes, outfits, and more. These are available in the Storybook Guide’s area, which you can access by talking to the Guide when you see them in Aviary Village or Home.\n\nWith this update, a new cape will appear in the in-game shop on December 9th, which is when the final Seasonal Quest becomes available:\n\nMoominmamma's Masterpiece cape: $24.99 (all prices USD)\n\nAs part of this special collaboration, this cape comes with the ability to teleport to the inside of a special version of the Moominvalley house! The ability can be activated after completing all six Seasonal Quests. Although the Moomin family and their friends won’t be home during your visit, you can bring your friends with you and explore the space together as Sky kids.\n\nIf you’re looking for the other Moomin in-app purchases in the meantime, instead of the in-game Shop, those are now available in the Storybook Guide’s area.\n\nMoominmamma’s Masterpiece cape and other special collaboration in-app purchases will be available only during the Season and are not currently planned to return once it concludes. If you see something you’d like, be sure to check the in-game store and the Storybook Guide’s area before the Season ends!\n\nAs for the emote and the two items available in the Storybook Guide’s Friendship Tree in exchange for regular Candles, these are planned to continue to be available after the Season ends.\n\nSeason of Moomin continues until 23:59 December 29th (all times PST, UTC -8).\n\n[Edit 2024.12.10] Updated description of the Moominmamma's Masterpiece cape to clarify when it becomes available in the in-game shop.\n\nDays of Music Echoes in the Realms\n\nFrom November 25th through December 8th Pacific time, Days of Music returns! This year’s event brings a suite of updates, with activities, features, and more inviting you to share music in brand new ways.\n\nTalk to the event guide Spirit in Aviary Village or Home. They’ll teleport you to stages across the realms.* Each location provides a unique prompt to create a song to share with others, as simple or intricate as you’d like. Choose from one of the instruments provided nearby, and then record your tune using a Shared Memory.\n\nIt’s the perfect opportunity to listen to other players’ creations, too! Browse through the other Shared Memories at the stage and you may even find inspiration for the next song you compose.\n\nFour event currency can be forged each day from event currency Light. This can be gathered as you take part in the event's activities. Plus, 15 bonus event currency will be placed around Aviary Village for the duration of the event, so no need to hurry to find them on the first day (keep your eye out for musical symbols)!\n\nDays of Music will feature new items plus mementos returning from previous years. New items available during the event are:\n\nMarching Band Cape: 50 event currency\n\nMusic Marching Uniform outfit: $9.99\n\nThese next two items will be introduced when Days of Music starts, and they’ll remain permanently available to unlock or purchase in Harmony Hall even after the event ends:\n\nJam Station: 250 Candles\n\nFledgling Upright Piano: $4.99\n\nThis piano appears in the prop category, which means that other players will be able to try it if you place it somewhere such as your Nest.\n\nFor details on returning Days of Music items, please refer to patch notes from previous years. As for items originally introduced for event currency, the Marching Band hat and saxophone will be 55 and 125 Candles respectively; the Marching Band hat will be available only during the event, but the saxophone will remain in Harmony Hall permanently. Free trial spells for all items can be found in Harmony Hall.\n\nSpeaking of the Jam Station: This item offers a TON of new features to enjoy! It offers a default instrument for each of its four parts, and every other instrument you already have in your closet are options to choose for each part too (the exception to this are instruments that are categorized as a placeable, like Duets pianos or the Fledgling Upright piano). Instrument selections and patterns will autosave, and the updated UI makes it easier to edit each part.\n\nThere’s more packed into the Jam Stations than we can fit in the patch notes, but we can’t wait to see the performances you make with them!\n\n(*The event guide in Home will be missing the teleport option in its Friendship Tree. This is not intended, and the teleport function will be available as intended in future events.)\n\nSharing Gifts During Days of Giving\n\nFrom 00:00 December 9th until 23:59 December 22nd PST (UTC -8), Days of Giving returns. During this time there will be:\n\nDouble Seasonal Light: 8 clusters of Seasonal Light can be collected in the daily realm for a total of two Seasonal Candles each day.\n\nDouble Treasure Candles: There will be 8 locations of large Treasure Candles in the same realm each day, instead of four.\n\nDouble Hearts: Every Heart and partial Heart gift sent during the event to a friend will be doubled.\n\nNote: Hearts and partial Heart gifts are doubled when they’re sent during the event. If a gift is sent before Days of Giving begins but is then collected during the event, it will not be doubled. Double Hearts will not apply to Hearts sent through Player Creations.\n\nSky x Alice’s Wonderland Cafe: A Curious Adventure\n\nFrom December 23, 2024 through January 12, 2025 get ready for a fantastical twist on Sky’s Days of Feast celebration! This special collaboration brings the magic of Alice in Wonderland to Sky with an event filled with memorable characters, stories, and surprises.\n\nWhen the event begins, keep your eye out in Home and Aviary Village for a creature who’s in a hurry. Follow them to find the entrance to an all-new event area where you’ll experience Sky from a very different perspective.\n\nTake a moment to talk with the various event Spirits there; they’ll also share some event currency Light if you help them with their requests. If you need a break from their shenanigans, their tea party offers Sky kids some Social Light, too.\n\nIn fact, five event currency can be gathered by completing the two activities with the Wonderland Cafe Spirits each day. Plus, as you explore what the area has to offer, you can find 15 bonus event currency tucked away around the Cafe. Like the bonus event currency in Days of Music, these are available during the entire event, so feel free to take your time to search for them.\n\nDon’t forget to explore around the rest of Sky, too! Days of Feast favorites are back in places like Dreams Village, Home, and the Secret Area available from the Vault of Knowledge. So if you’ve been looking forward to being transformed into a snow kid or spending time with a favorite Spirit in the snow hut in Home, you’ll have the chance to do just that.\n\nNew items coming with Sky x Alice’s Wonderland Cafe are:\n\nWonderland Stacked Hat: 18 event currency\n\nWonderland Frantic Hair: 30 event currency\n\nWonderland Teacup Bath prop: 36 event currency\n\nWonderland Hare Hairstyle: 150 Candles\n\nThis item will be permanently available to unlock after the event ends by traveling to the Wonderland Cafe via the Wonderland Cafe Corridor prop\n\nWonderland Primrose Pinafore Set: $11.99\n\nIncludes a hair accessory and a primrose-yellow dress inspired by the outfit Alice wore in Lewis Carroll’s classic story\n\nWonderland Cafe Corridor: $19.99\n\nThis passageway allows you to travel back to the Wonderland Cafe from everywhere but the stormiest places in Sky, even after the event ends. Once placed, the travel ability can be used by any player who interacts with it.\n\nFor details on returning items, please refer to patch notes from previous years. As for items introduced for event currency last year, the Winter Pine Cone Hairclip and Winter Feast Snowboard will be 35 and 145 Candles respectively. Free trial spells for all items are available in the Wonderland Cafe.\n\nA Special Group of Visiting Spirits is On Its Way\n\nA group of past Seasonal Spirits is set to arrive and add extra energy to the start of the new year!\n\nMark your calendars for January 13th through 26th 2025. During that time, one of the Spirits from this group will appear in Aviary Village and Home to teleport you to where they and their friends will gather. While they’re visiting, you’ll have the chance to unlock seasonal items that they brought with them during their original seasons.\n\nNew Year’s Fireworks\n\nTo celebrate the beginning of 2025, don’t miss Sky’s special fireworks show! It will be held in Home and Aviary Village starting at 02:00 December 31st (the earliest New Year, 00:00 in Kiribati), and repeating every hour until 04:00 January 1st (the latest New Year, 00:00 on Howland Island).\n\nTo enter the New Year’s fireworks show in Aviary Village, teleport from the fireworks staff. This will be available if you’ve completed the quest at the top of the Hopeful Steward’s Friendship Tree.\n\nWatch with old friends, join with new ones, or mark the moment in whatever way is cozy to you.\n\nEven More Updates\n\nNews in Sky\n\nPlayers have shared a lot of feedback asking for ways to keep up with official news and announcements shared through blog posts and patch notes. In 0.27.5, we’re excited to start rolling out a News feature that will make these easily accessible in the game!\n\nIn this update, players on mobile platforms will find this feature in the Settings menu. Simply tap on the News icon and you’ll be able to easily scroll through Sky’s most recent blog posts and patch notes.\n\nIf you’re on Steam, Switch, or PlayStation, don’t worry, we’ll be unveiling this feature for you soon! In the meantime, we’re working on optimizing it to work smoothly and meet the unique needs of console platforms. Stay tuned for a future update!\n\nStart Sky in Your Nest, and Other Nesting & Aviary Updates\n\nAnother feature we’re adding based on your feedback: You can now choose to start the game in your Nest! This is a quieter and calmer starting point, so you’ll still need to hop down to Aviary Village to check your Friendship Constellation and Daily Quests. Note that when you use the option in the Settings or Expression menus to teleport back to your “home base,” players with their Nest set as their starting point will be teleported to the realm portals in Aviary.\n\n“Hop down?” you ask. “From where?” Great question—you’ll be able to hop down to Aviary Village from the cozy balcony that has also been added to Nests in this update.\n\nMeanwhile in Aviary Village:\n\nThe Nesting Workshop has a new prop that you can use to hang one of your masks as a wall decoration. Find it in the workshop menu under a newly updated “permanently available” selection of items that can be unlocked.\n\nSpeaking of items in the Nesting Worskhop—the Nesting Workshop now has a section for permanent offerings in addition to a rotating items section. This will make it possible to unlock certain Nest essentials without having to wait for their rotation to come around.\n\nThe place to pick up the daily Season Candle and Hearts gifted through Player Creations has been moved from the Friendship Shrine to the statue near the gates to the levels.\n\nConstruction Work in Aviary Village\n\nIn 0.27.5, you may notice some construction work in the area where the events workshop was. While that construction is underway, this will still be the place to go if you’d like to travel to an event area quickly—Spirits will be waiting for you here while their event is active, and they’ll offer you a teleport option. Those event locations will also be where event cosmetics can be unlocked or purchased, too.\n\nSave Custom Chat Messages in your Emote Favorites Menu\n\nIf there’s a particular phrase you use a lot when chatting with friends, now you can add it to your emote favorites menu! Use this to quickly send custom chat messages like “Thanks!” or “Meet me back in Aviary Village,” or “No, you shouldn't try to hug a Dark Dragon.”\n\nFriendly Account Linking Reminder…\n\nWe have some fun stuff planned to share with you in December. On a related note, if you have a Twitch account, be sure to link it with your Sky account.\n\nContinued Daily Quest Improvements\n\nAlong with another batch of new Daily Quests (we hope you’ve been enjoying them!), we’ve included some quality of life improvements. For example:\n\nIn the realms, use your Sky kid’s call to reveal a radar point for Daily Quest Spirits whom you haven’t already met.\n\nPhoto quests have a progress meter.\n\nWhen you turn in your Daily Quests to a Spirit, the icon has been updated from an exclamation mark to a checkmark.\n\nIn Aviary Village, the Spirit behind the counter will offer you a small treat after you turn in all of your quests.\n\nDaily Quest list text will update with hints once you start to do them.\n\nAdditional Graphics Options for Mobile Platforms\n\nPlayers on mobile devices can now choose separate settings from resolution and frame rates under Graphics Settings in the Settings menu. Note that support for some resolution and frame rate options is dependent on device capabilities.\n\nImprovements and Bug Fixes in this update include:\n\nItems with a ✶ symbol next to it means that this is a fix for something that the player community reported to us. So thank you for letting us know about the bugs you’ve come across!\n\nGameplay\n\n✶ Fixed a bug that was warping players to the location of the Snufkin tent prop whenever they spawned into an area.\n\n✶ Fixed bug that prevented players from interacting with certain UI elements while moving the virtual joystick.\n\n✶ Resolved a crash that could occur when entering edit mode at the Shared Spaces shrine in the Butterfly Fields area of Daylight Prairie.\n\n✶ Fixed a bug that was changing the musical key an instrument would play in even when the background music was muted or faded.\n\nUpdated conditions to be able to gift friends an in-app purchase; in addition to the existing pre-requisites, the giver must also have progressed to at least Valley of Triumph.\n\n[PC] Fixed a bug causing flight mode to toggle off while using the Days of Mischief broom.\n\n[iOS] Fixed crashes that could occur while using in-game video recording.\n\nCosmetics\n\n✶ Players with short avatars or wearing the chibi mask probably noticed that several capes, namely the Duets ultimate cape, Snowflake Cape, and Mischief Gossamer Cape, had appeared strangely shrunken when equipped. These have been put through a special unshrinking process and should now appear normal again.\n\n✶ All of the notes on the Passage ocarina play properly again.\n\n✶ Harmonica sounds are once again consistent.\n\nCorrected the teal color of the tier two teal cape to more appropriately match the teal of the tier one version.\n\nRelated known issue: The contrast between the main cape color and the border is not as distinct as it should be. This will be resolved in a future update.\n\n✶ Fixed bug that caused shoe cosmetics to oddly layer on top of the Roving Snufkin Robe outfit.\n\n✶ Glow spell glows the right way again.\n\nImproved the wooden grain texture of the Mischief Withered Horns.\n\nUpdated the Season of Moomin scarf to reduce clipping with certain capes.\n\nTweaks to the Season of Moomin bow neck accessory to reduce clipping with various capes and outfits.\n\nGeneral Fixes and Improvements\n\n[Android] Various graphics improvements.\n\nUpdated the description when using the “teleport home” feature to make it clearer that you’ll be returning to the realm portals in your chosen area, to avoid confusion that could arise with using the term “home” to refer to more than one area.\n\n✶ Chat translations can once again be reverted in the chat log.\n\n✶ In areas where there is both a Shared Memory shrine and a Spirit, the shrine no longer disappears after a player completes their memory quest.\n\n✶ Flying or diving while wearing the Mischief Raven-feathered Cloak won’t leave black pixellated streaks in the sky or water.\n\n✶ Fixed a bug in the outfit shop in Aviary Village that could make the Moth and Sparrow Appreciation Pack displays appear to be black or unlit.\n\n✶ Fixed a bug that could prevent mobile players from using a bluetooth keyboard.\n\n✶ When a nearby player who was using the reading expression exits the game, their book should no longer remain floating awkwardly in the level as if it expects you to put it away or something.\n\n✶ If a players is asked to complete an in-game survey and starts to fill it out, tapping outside of the survey window should no longer cause survey results to be lost or reset.\n\n✶ A blocked player’s Shared Memories, Shared Spaces, and Message Boats should no longer load into the level, even if you had selected the option to “follow”/see more of their creations.\n\n✶ The warning that appears when you’ve reached the maximum capacity for a Shared Space is a bit clearer now.\n\nUpdated the minimum distance that Player Creations can be placed from the Ancestor’s Table in the Elevated Clearing.\n\nCorrected a typo in the confirmation text before activating the glow spell.\n\nFixed the highlight outline appearing over the play/stop button while viewing a Player Creation when the button wasn’t selected.\n\nFixed a bug that skipped players directly from Home to the Valley of Triumph Coliseum area.\n\nFixed the slightly disturbing issue of the Admiring Actor not really having a face under their mask.\n\nPlease refer to this page for known issues ongoing or introduced with this patch: Known Issues Patch 0.27.5.",

      "# [Europa Preview - Preview](http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/preview/66932/europa-switch-preview)\nVideo games are a great medium to scratch that itch for exploration. In my day-to-day, cubicle squatting, paper pushing life, a yearning to break the monotony and have a wholly new experience can be constant, especially when the next vacation is out in the far future. Even if not adorned with the high-octane, action-packed worlds of something like Spider-Man or inFamous, those quieter and more thought-provoking worlds can hit emotional peaks and artistic beauty that eclipses the potential graphical and framerate downgrades. Europa is a quiet, lush world with expansive-looking landscapes, sparse patches of living creatures, and signs of civilization that either look abandoned or crumbling.\n\nEuropa is the story of a boy landing on the fictional, titular world. As a nameless protagonist, I was led-along story beats by pages in a journal from an uncle who writes to their nephew of the wonders of Europa, and this uncharted world’s opportunity to be a new home for the human race. He speaks of Europa as a paradise, and writes in language that not only describes the land but develops his character traits. It’s a great way to manage story beats while also signposting, but the injection of his perspective colors the world in a way that left me questioning whether we’re getting the unvarnished truth or his rose-colored view.\n\nEuropa does this neat trick where while the landscapes made me feel like the scope was endless, different areas are broken up into still large, but constrained zones. These broad spaces have the streamlined tasks earmarked by journal entries but you’re welcome to investigate every nook and cranny for collectables or to see all the sights. Movement across the world is quiet and slower paced, but it feels intentional to force the player to stop and smell the roses. A jump, charge jump, glide, and a booster backpack don’t increase your speed, but do increase the verticality of Europa. The booster pack needs refills from glistening blue orbs, but in the demo they were littered about and didn’t pose any restrictions. The joy I felt in shooting up like a rocket and then slowly gliding back down to earth was palpable and never got tiring.\n\nI would be remiss to not touch on performance, art, and audio production. In a prior Steam Next Fest, I had the pleasure of trying out this same demo on PC. While the PC is undeniably the better performing platform depending on your rig, I did not find the Switch demo to be such a step down that it’d mar the experience. The world is gorgeous but not crisply drawn, which allowed a graphical hit without sacrificing the wonder and beauty. Think of something like thatgamecompany’s Flower – the PlayStation 3 original has all the beauty and depth of more current ports, but just lacks some of the crisp single blades of grass and can’t hit sixty frames per second. Europa’s charm is married with a soundtrack anchored by quiet piano and stringed instruments that crescendos into sweeping moments to create wonderful exclamation points of emotion.\n\nIf the demo is a good reflection of the final release, Europa will provide a world to explore with heart in story and presentation that is undeniable. Europa comes to Nintendo Switch later this year.",

      "# [Stalk’s Videogame Corner: Flower on 2024-08-03](https://cubiccreativity.wordpress.com/2024/08/03/the-videogame-corner-flower/)\nGame: Flower\n\nDeveloper: Thatgamecompany\n\nGenre: Adventure Game, Art Game\n\nReleases: 2009 (Playstation 3), 2013 (Playstation 4, Playstation Vita), 2019 (Windows)\n\nStalk’s Rating: 7/10\n\n“The concept of video games as a form of art is a commonly debated topic within the entertainment industry. Though video games have been afforded legal protection as creative works by the Supreme Court of the United States, the philosophical proposition that video games are works of art remains in question, even when considering the contribution of expressive elements such as acting, visuals, stories, interaction and music. Even art games, games purposely designed to be a work of creative expression, have been challenged as works of art by some critics.”\n\n– Wikipedia, “Video games as an art form”\n\nI can remember conversations with people that were moved by some videogames so much that they proclaimed that the product at hand was not just for entertainment purposes but was in fact art; and in a sense, I can get behind the sentiment. In times when entire orchestras are tasked with producing videogame music, concept art for games becoming ever more elaborate and stunning, and the border of what videogames actually are being constantly redefined, the idea of placing them under the protective screen that is the term “art” sounds reasonable. Now, I do not want to open this debate and there are just as many examples for videogames being more of a cultural phenomenon and for entertainment purposes, but in rare cases that border between art and game becomes a rather thin one. “Flower” is just a game, taking the medium of a videogame to create an artsy experience; one that I wrote a few paragraphs about in the following article.\n\nFrom the very beginning, “Flower” challenges the idea of being a videogame. There are no health bar, enemies, highscores, combos, or basically anything that one would know from a regular videogame. Instead, “Flower” is more of an interactive experience and one should be open for the idea before giving it a try. Like pretty much any game from “thatgamecompany”, “Flower” questions the very idea of what a videogame is or could be. “Journey”, just to name another example from the same company, was a co-op experience with very little tools. It would have been easy to give the players a voice chat instead of forcing them to communicate with chirps, but that would have been a very different game; and quite honestly not nearly as interesting of an experience.\n\nSo, knowing that “thatgamecompany” works with minimalist approaches to videogames, what do you do in “Flower”? Well, your character, if you want to look at it this way, is a gust of wind. You are able to steer that gust through the stage in front of you, always starting with one little flower petal playfully flying around, being transported by the wind on this audio-visual journey. Flowers on your way will start to bloom when you pass them, giving you a petal as a thanking gesture and slowly but surely causing a few specks of color to become a petal storm .There is little to no pressure in “Flower”, which is by design. In a world as loud, busy, and grey as the world we are living in, it sometimes is best to just calm down, relax, and enjoy the beauty in life. “Flower” gives this idea a playable representation.\n\nGameplay-wise, there is little to say since I basically described all there is to do: You play the wind carrying petals, causing flowers to bloom which slowly heals the world giving it more color or bringing life back to nature. This visually pleasing scenario is also supported by music and sounds: The soundtrack is pleasant and fits the atmosphere of each level perfectly, and the speed and intensity increases when you pick up speed or manage to clear all flowers in one area. The levels themselves get somewhat harder over time since you can eventually lose petals again, but this should not be difficult enough to cause any major frustration.\n\nThe levels themselves also tell their own little story. While you start on a wide field during a pleasant afternoon, the stages become gradually darker with nature having to claw back from the brink of extermination against cold steel structures. Even the main menu showcases this idea, with every stage you unlock placing another bright-colored flower on the table of a run-down apartment in a mono-chrome metropolis, standing in stark defiance against the all-consuming grey. It tries to evoke emotions in the player, which makes it so hard to write about “Flower”; and makes it even harder to rate. Whether this two-hour long game manages to capture you with its seven levels or it fails to do so because you expected more or something different is entirely subjective. I for one liked “Flower”, although I have to say that playing it once was enough for me. At the end of the day, “Flower” is a beautiful-looking experience with nice and soothing tunes, but like in games such as “Gone Home” you as a player need to manage your expectations and determine whether it is something you would want to play.",
