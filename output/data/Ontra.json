This allowed us to assign specific obligations and tasks to the appropriate stakeholders across our firm. In turn, we could quickly answer complex questions from our investors, drive organizational accountability, and stay ahead of the growing complexity of private funds documentation.”\n\nNeal Kalechofsky |\n\nFormer Vice President of Alternatives Legal\n\nPharos Capital Group\n\n“The top objective was being able to confidently and quickly provide that list of side letter provisions to the SEC when requested. And that was exactly what Insight enabled us to do.”\n\nKimberly Futrell |\n\nCCO and CFO\n\nSentinel Capital Partners\n\n“No one else could meet the needs of our business model, especially at scale. It felt like Ontra was in a class of one. Other companies were pushing AI tools that were under-developed and still required a lot of manual work, and external law firms were far too expensive and in a constant state of turnover.”\n\nVincent Taurassi |\n\nGeneral Counsel and COO\n\nFir Tree Partners\n\n“Since partnering with Ontra to process routine legal contracts, we’ve saved an extraordinary amount of time and resources. Our team can now focus on higher-value work and strategic initiatives. The legal department is seen as a strategic advisor to the business rather than a hurdle to clear.

From there I ask it theoretical claim questions like, “I had X happen to me and attempted to clarify it with merchant—no resolve was offered from X and I’m requesting a full refund.”  The AI program would respond with likelihoods for claim denials, citing articles within the T&C, or not (alluding to increased likelihood of claim approval).               Does something like this exist?                                          I just had a lackluster chargeback experience with Visa where they so easily could have warned me, as I made the claim, that it would very likely get denied and here’s why ______.  But no.                                          So that means it’s up to me (us)♥️\n\n## Comment ID kyw33m3 with +1 score by [(Realistic_Wolf_6446, Reddit, 2024-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaltech/comments/17ewo3q/legal_ai_what_have_you_used_reviews/kyw33m3/) (in reply to ID 17ewo3q):\nI'm using Pincites and the functionality is great, and they help you build out whatever playbooks you need to get started immediately.

Pre/Dicta looks at every ump that looks just like yours, across the entire history of baseball, with every player that resembles every player on your team and the opponent, and every manager and coach that resembles every manager and coach in your game, and every weather forecast that was the same as your weather, and so on and so on... basically, it looks at trillions of data combinations, and will tell you how that Umpire is going to call the game... with 85% accuracy.  \n\nThe difference between conventional filter based analytics and Pre/Dicta is the difference between an Almanac and NASA AI/Machine Learning Climate forecasting.

They're scans, often compound documents (as in documents created at different times added together - a master with appendices and exhibits, or an amendment with schedules, toss in a few Work Orders in between things). As scans, they usually have random handwriting, artifacts, etc. As compound documents, they may have single column then double column, sometimes triple column, then it might switch to landscape orientation for printed spreadsheets tucked into the contract. I've found plenty of OCR that can address each item individually, but nothing that can correctly OCR the entire document. When the doc starts out single column then changes to double or triple column, most OCR ends up giving me single lines across (breaking the columns) which is useless.\nThe next issue is that contracts are stored as PDF, which, for text, means there are returns inserted at the end of each line (and they rarely correspond to the true end of a sentence.) As a result, I have to try to structure regex to look for phrases that may span a line, but I also need to capture the entire clause, which again proves quite difficult with end of line returns inserted throughout. Between the end of line returns and the OCR issues compound the complexity, since it generally means I can't rely on punctuation to be accurate (periods are often OCRd as commas, semicolons as commas, commas as periods, etc.)\n\nIf I have plain text, no OCR issues, and no odd returns throughout, I can handle things beautifully with regex. But the only way I get that is to manually fix the text.\n\n### Comment ID k9xs5r8 with +1 score by [(PLERoss, Reddit, 2023-11-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaltech/comments/17ewo3q/legal_ai_what_have_you_used_reviews/k9xs5r8/) (in reply to ID k9xp061):\nI’ve been looking too!

And to your point about AI research, I work with a company that is heavily invested in AI and with the recent surge in LLMs such as GPT and Claude being so dominant as a general use and cheap alternative to modeling your own bespoke LM, Ruby is very well positioned to be a more dominant player in this area.

Unlike many of commenters here I have had great success and have found that being a seasoned Rails dev to be in high demand. That said, I am seeing a trend currently where frontend React devs are highly in demand.\n\nI was on the React train in the early days (2016'ish) and really thought that is was the future of frontend development. This really seems to be where the world has moved recently and React developers are generally in high demand, so it is generally a good skill to have on your resume.\n\nBUT, from what I have learned in my 12 years of being a primarily Rails dev is that DHH is pretty much always 2-3 years ahead of the industry and is almost always right. A lot of people will argue that Rails is \"dead\" but I whole heartedly disagree. I really think what they are doing with modern Javascript is where the future is, and Rails is embracing it and forging the path ahead.\n\nWhen the \"hot new thing\" in React was server side rendering (https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components), it really made me chuckle a bit. This has been the default for Rails since the beginning. Internet speed, browser capabilities, and the maturity of JavaScript has generally made these complicated front end frameworks mostly worthless IMO.\n\nAll that said, I would say learning Rails is a worthwhile endeavor. It's here to stay, and if you are proficient with Laravel it won't be a huge leap to learn Ruby/Rails, and it might even be a delight! It's definitely worth at least a few hours of your time to see if it jives with you.

I do acknowledge a month off for burn out in these firms would be very detrimental if you then decided you wanted to stay but resigning would also have the same impact. \n\nDo you like law? Can you imagine liking law? My husband is PQE6 with a great life balance working in house. Lower pay, and there are issues, but 4 day working week, weekends are his, no burn out.

From my perspective, very few people there actually care about the company and none of them are managers. The managers just try to convince to do things for “a greater good” so you put in free overtime and make them look good for their next promotion.\n\nIf you really do care about law, then go in house as others suggest, do the bits that you like on your contracted hours, and go home at 5 and switch off your phone / laptop.\n\nI made a career in a technical specialist field with a STEM background and caring about my employer (a big uk bank) and believing the corporate propaganda caused my burn out. Now I’m a consultant (because I like the work I did / do), earn more, stick to my contracted work time and am overall much happier. \n\nYes, I still suffer from post burn out, but I manage it a lot better and get back on track faster - by simply prioritising my needs over my employer’s or client’s needs. I guess your field is niche enough that skills and experience are hard to come by, so usually people involved can’t complain too hard as they don’t want to alienate you. \n\nAlso, once you set boundaries (especially at the beginning) and stick to them, people are forced to work around and accept it. I had been gaslighted in the past that I needed to prove myself every single day, but after some time realised that people earning more than me did less and sometimes even displayed their slacker attitude, but had no risk of getting fired. You’d be surprised how much of your experience was a result of you trying to be too pleasing to everyone. \n\nOne very last point of advice - go for some form of therapy. I for example tried CBT and al the insights I shared above my therapist brought out to me and really helped to start my mindset changed which (together with the job change and boundary setting) saved my sanity and my high earning job - as a matter of fact, I wasn’t HENRY when I was burnt out, but now am - with less stress. I relate as I come from a working family (did OU as well :) ) and it’s not worth sacrificing many years of high earning potential without trying different solutions first.\n\n#### Comment ID kvc9ht2 with +9 score by [(Kittykittycatcat1000, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvc9ht2/) (in reply to ID kvc5vf5):\nWhat about the civil service?

You are in a mugs game. The hours, stress, nature of the work and utter uselessness of what you do will grind you down. However, you can leave! And you are in an awesome position, you've done a great slog, got the CV stuff and you will walk your next gig. I moved in house and did the industry rounds. If you still want to work the  corporate ladder and want to do variety of work this is the route for you. If you want to FIRE its locum work. This career choice gets a little taking used to as it's so unlike what the people that have trained you would do. But you take complete rein of your own life and get to quit and spend 6 months travelling wherever you want. Also you can work remotely, which means from any destination. If you care about freedom, have no major financial commitments and can live with the ego hit from peers, this one is for you. This is my current choice. \nOther alternatives could be taking a corporate role in the Arab world. Low tax more sun. \nNGO work is surprisingly stressful and you are up against people with higher PQE that don't care about the pay. The interesting work is at a very high PQE level and you will deskilling if you move now. It's a world of privilege in many ways (in my experience, 6 month at International NGO).\nI would advise stay in law and make a few different moves. Only then think about leaving.

Everyone - and I really do mean everyone - has a patch somewhere between 1-3PQE where the job is horrible. Lots of people leave at that point, but even those who don’t have a wobble around then.

So you’re doing an awful lot of graft with a lot of pressure being placed on you, but no real release valve for it.\n\nYou also tend to be one of the best levels to delegate to because 2-3 PQE is the sweet spot profitability wise.\n\nSo it’s a shitty time in private practice, but if you make it out the other side the job can become pretty fun again.\n\n## Comment ID kvbymk7 with +12 score by [(NormalMaverick, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvbymk7/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nI've often contemplated the same - I know someone who moved from being a strategy consultant in London to a schoolteacher in the North, and she seems happy with her choice.

E.g., instead of earning £140k in PE corporate law at an MC firm, working in-house somewhere for £80-90k.\n\nIt also comes down to you as a person. Would you be happy with a lower earning life, especially seeing your current peers go on to become partners etc.? At the same time, you would have your life to pursue hobbies, relationships, family, side hustles etc.\n\nAvoid making a rash decision because of how crap some days at work are.

I know the feeling. Mine got so bad I would walk to work and think of I got hit by a car or a bus at least I'd be in hospital and couldn't be contacted for a few days / weeks. It felt like there was no escape. \n\nLeaving that company was the best thing that I ever did. I took a job with less responsibility within the same industry and within a month I was no longer burnt out and I missed the responsibility I had. Within 6 months I was yearning for more and felt uninspired. \n\nMy point is, like many others have said, burnout needs tending to. If you can take time off, leave your job or be signed off, then you may find you love your job but it's the relentlessness of it that's having an impact. \n\nLeaving that job was the best thing I ever did. It was so toxic, the hours were insane and the management ground everyone to the floor. When I was in that place (partly due to the management and general nature of the business), it felt like there was no where to go. We were told our competitors were terrible and I felt like I couldn't do the type of work we did anywhere else. \n\nThat was a lie, and I'm better paid, happier and doing better work than I've ever done. If you feel like the company could be the issue - leave, join somewhere which is less intense and you can spend a year or two figuring out what you'd like to do less stressed and with more time to consider. I spent just under 2 years at a new company after I burnt out, and then I took a promotion, a 20% salary increase and now I'm back on my feet and absolutely loving work. \n\nBurnout is no joke. Take it seriously and if you're aware of it and posting about it on Reddit, you need to quit your job and give yourself time to recuperate. You'll be surprised how quickly you return to normal once you're out of the situation!\n\n## Comment ID kvbvm2c with +3 score by [(Menryn1924, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvbvm2c/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nI wasn't a million miles away from your situation, but I didn't walk away from law - just that job.\n\nIf you get a job in-house or at another firm (with a better balance) you can be conservative with the date you can start, and push your firm to either put you on gardening leave or let you leave after less than your full notice period.

It's also highly technical so intellectually stimulating.\n\nIt has its moments, but mostly the job is 9 - 5.30, and I go home and have time with my family (which never would have happened if I hadn't left the city). It's non-transactional and not court based so it's totally feasible to do part time (I do 4 days pw). Of course the pay is never going to be anything like corporate- but I have a life now and that is more than worth the reduction in pay. \n\nDon't regret teaching but part of me wished I had take more time to think and pivoted then by changing specialisms! Good luck!\n\n## Comment ID kvca2st with +2 score by [(ComplexOccam, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvca2st/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\n125k isa, 150k pension and a salary of 140k is lacklustre financials? \n\nThe rest of us are screwed then. \n\n\nMake the subtle change now in your life before burnout does a big one for you.\n\n### Comment ID kvcolk3 with +1 score by [(Sea_Ad5614, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvcolk3/) (in reply to ID kvca2st):\nI was thinking the same, I thought that was pretty excellent 🤣\n\n## Comment ID kvc10xc with +1 score by [(M_peeps, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvc10xc/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nIn house-benefits of stability and good pay whilst still 0900-1800?\n\n## Comment ID kvc7ti4 with +1 score by [(Old_Branch6343, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvc7ti4/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nHave you thought about sticking with PE but moving in-house? The hours are a lot more 9-5, except for when deals are going through but it’s nothing compared to private practice. You will undoubtedly have to take a pay cut but in house 2 PQE legal counsel can expect £110-150k base, with a bonus and generous carried interest/ shares schemes. It’s also arguably a lot more interesting - you are involved in the commercial side of transactions with exposure to the deals teams, not just churning out documents.

It is both a mental and physical thing. I read a study a long time ago that said that the physical side of burnout is from not having enough serotonin precursor, so I took 5htp (which turns into serotonin precursor) and I immediately felt better.\n\nI would've quit my job. Now I do that job on top of another pretty much full time job, and despite working every hour there is I generally feel alright. Far far better than I did with just HALF of the workload. \n\nAnd I don't have to take 5htp every day.

With a magical wink and a wobbly gait, he journeyed through the enchanted Trantula Forest, where every tree sang the melody of a nibbity-blop.\n\nBlongus’s first stop was the Brintle Cave, where the walls dripped with glowing nectar. He met the wise Waption, who spoke in riddles of ancient fraptions and led him to the hidden grotto of the Glozzit Stones. There, the stones hummed a tune that could make anyone dance, even the grumpy old Trontus.\n\nNiptus, a playful sprite with wompish wings, joined Blongus as he frolicked through the Misty Meadows. They skipped and jibbled, glomped and giggled, each step echoing with joy. In the heart of the meadow, they found the Siggidy-Tibber Tree, its branches heavy with bloppity fruits that sparkled in the sun. The fruits were said to grant wishes, so they picked a handful, each hoping for a bit of magic.\n\nTheir next adventure took them to the Frothy Falls, where the water cascaded in shimmering rainbows. Here, the Glibber Fish, known for their riddles, challenged them to a game. Niptus and Blongus, after much laughing and guessing, won the game and received a golden mizzle from the Glibber Chief, a token of their bravery.\n\nAs they traveled deeper into the mystical land, they arrived at the bustling Market of Mizzus. There, vendors sold everything from enchanted gusley beans to the rarest bluggo feathers. Blongus and Niptus sampled every delicacy and danced with the market folk under the starlit sky.\n\nTheir journey continued through the Twilight Tangle, a forest where every step seemed to sing with a krintle. They discovered the Fription Fields, where the flowers whispered secrets of the ancients. Blongus and Niptus listened intently, learning the lore of the Siggidy-Frantle, a mythical creature that guarded the treasure of the Trontle Mountains.\n\nMoptus, a mischievous gnome with a heart of gold, joined them in their quest. He led them to the Wibble-Tantle Tower, where the Blintle Goblins played their flibbly flutes. They danced until dawn, their feet moving in perfect harmony with the gro-flibbly tunes.\n\nAs they neared the end of their journey, they arrived at the Glompton Plains. There, the skies were painted with every color imaginable, and the air was filled with the scent of wample flowers. They rested under the Clabble Tree, where dreams were woven into reality.\n\nIn the final chapter of their grand adventure, Blongus, Niptus, and Moptus discovered the hidden Trantus Caverns. Within the caverns, they found the legendary Siggidy-Kraddletop, a magical artifact that could grant eternal happiness. They realized that the true magic was not in the artifact but in the journey they had shared, the friendships they had forged, and the laughter that had filled their hearts.\n\nWith a final siggidy-jibble, they returned to Kraddlewood, where their stories were told for generations, a testament to the wonders of friendship and the magic of adventure.\"\n\n## Comment ID l4qrwk3 with +2 score by [(Such--Balance, Reddit, 2024-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1cvmcc9/i_convinced_chatgpt_to_make_up_a_meaningless_new/l4qrwk3/) (in reply to ID 1cvmcc9):\nI, as a man, never say no to the niptus\n\n## Comment ID l4rbvij with +2 score by [(TedKerr1, Reddit, 2024-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1cvmcc9/i_convinced_chatgpt_to_make_up_a_meaningless_new/l4rbvij/) (in reply to ID 1cvmcc9):\nNow press the listen button\n\n## Comment ID l4svq00 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1cvmcc9/i_convinced_chatgpt_to_make_up_a_meaningless_new/l4svq00/) (in reply to ID 1cvmcc9):\nClaude tried to translate it and came up with this:\n\nBlongus kraddletop wibber zantle prap mibbly-snap.

However, the impact of this positive change is stifled by the company’s structure. Despite hiring these capable individuals, the original leadership—composed of former lawyers—remains in ultimate control.\n\nAs a result, even though the newly hired experts often propose innovative ideas, valuable feedback, and strategic improvements, their suggestions are frequently sidelined or dismissed. This creates a frustrating environment for those who came on board expecting to make a difference, only to find their expertise undervalued.\n\nOntra has potential, but its insistence on maintaining a leadership model rooted in its origins rather than evolving to meet the demands of a modern SaaS organization limits its ability to fully leverage the talent it has brought in. For prospective employees, this may be something to carefully consider before joining.\n\nBe prepared to be reprimanded and abused by the former lawyers in leadership.

Things have become really bad in the past six months. Leadership makes fake promises of improving things, but in the end, it only makes things worse for the people who do the work. A certain leader went on a listening tour and spoke for 23 minutes out of the 25 minutes allotted for listening to an employee. So you can imagine how much the leadership cares about its employees. One manager's modus operandi is to fire people on her team every few months. Good luck if you are on her team. Workload has increased, or in some cases, tripled, and pay has in fact decreased. Another leader claims that a certain task can be completed in 2 hours, whereas in reality it can take an entire week. Of course, that leader has never done any work at the ground level. Work gets dumped on you all the time!!",

          "cons": "It becomes apparent early on that transparency and fairness, which were promised upfront, are nothing but empty words. Despite being quoted a specific compensation upon accepting the position, the actual earnings fell far short, and there was no effort to rectify this discrepancy. The disparity in salaries between employees at different levels, even when their job responsibilities are identical, is a major concern. The company avoids addressing these glaring discrepancies and crucial employee questions, such as the absence of a 401k match, during company-wide meetings. Management's response to salary adjustments has been nothing short of a constant stream of excuses. Despite initial claims that salaries were \"above market\" or competitive, these assertions fail to acknowledge the impact of inflation over time. What might have seemed like a favorable salary upon joining the company loses its advantage as the cost of living increases. In reality, employees are now faced with a disheartening choice, realizing that despite the excuses provided, they are effectively experiencing a salary reduction of over 10% due to the soaring cost of living. On top of the favoritism and broken promises, another disillusioning aspect of working at this company was the current lack of promotion opportunities. During the hiring process, they boasted about a high likelihood of upward mobility within a year, creating a sense of optimism among new employees. However, as time went on, it became evident that these promises were nothing more than empty assurances. The path to advancement has been riddled with obstacles. The lack of career growth opportunities and the feeling of being stuck in the same role for an extended period has added to the growing dissatisfaction with the company's management and their lack of commitment to their own promises. The most significant problem within this company is the rampant favoritism displayed by higher-ups. The issue of favoritism extends to the leadership team, where it is evident that many members of the c-suite surround themselves with friends. Consequently, any problems or concerns are either ignored or inadequately addressed, further contributing to a toxic work environment. Attempts to raise concerns to people partners about favoritism or any other issues proved futile, as they merely took note of the problem without offering any resolution. The lack of accountability and disregard for employee feedback further exacerbated the discontent. One incident that particularly highlighted the lack of accountability within the company was when a leader used a slur during a weekly team meeting. The company took an unreasonably long time to issue an apology, which, when it finally came, felt insincere and failed to hold the leader accountable for their behavior.",

        "cons": "It becomes apparent early on that transparency and fairness, which were promised upfront, are nothing but empty words. Despite being quoted a specific compensation upon accepting the position, the actual earnings fell far short, and there was no effort to rectify this discrepancy. The disparity in salaries between employees at different levels, even when their job responsibilities are identical, is a major concern. The company avoids addressing these glaring discrepancies and crucial employee questions, such as the absence of a 401k match, during company-wide meetings. Management's response to salary adjustments has been nothing short of a constant stream of excuses. Despite initial claims that salaries were \"above market\" or competitive, these assertions fail to acknowledge the impact of inflation over time. What might have seemed like a favorable salary upon joining the company loses its advantage as the cost of living increases. In reality, employees are now faced with a disheartening choice, realizing that despite the excuses provided, they are effectively experiencing a salary reduction of over 10% due to the soaring cost of living. On top of the favoritism and broken promises, another disillusioning aspect of working at this company was the current lack of promotion opportunities. During the hiring process, they boasted about a high likelihood of upward mobility within a year, creating a sense of optimism among new employees. However, as time went on, it became evident that these promises were nothing more than empty assurances. The path to advancement has been riddled with obstacles. The lack of career growth opportunities and the feeling of being stuck in the same role for an extended period has added to the growing dissatisfaction with the company's management and their lack of commitment to their own promises. The most significant problem within this company is the rampant favoritism displayed by higher-ups. The issue of favoritism extends to the leadership team, where it is evident that many members of the c-suite surround themselves with friends. Consequently, any problems or concerns are either ignored or inadequately addressed, further contributing to a toxic work environment. Attempts to raise concerns to people partners about favoritism or any other issues proved futile, as they merely took note of the problem without offering any resolution. The lack of accountability and disregard for employee feedback further exacerbated the discontent. One incident that particularly highlighted the lack of accountability within the company was when a leader used a slur during a weekly team meeting. The company took an unreasonably long time to issue an apology, which, when it finally came, felt insincere and failed to hold the leader accountable for their behavior.",

        "cons": "Ontra is an organization with a unique founding story—created and run by former lawyers who initially had no technical or SaaS experience. While this background brought deep industry knowledge, it also introduced significant challenges in building a technology-first company.\n\nTo their credit, the company recognized some of these gaps and underwent a restructuring, bringing in experienced professionals with robust backgrounds in tech and SaaS. However, the impact of this positive change is stifled by the company’s structure. Despite hiring these capable individuals, the original leadership—composed of former lawyers—remains in ultimate control.\n\nAs a result, even though the newly hired experts often propose innovative ideas, valuable feedback, and strategic improvements, their suggestions are frequently sidelined or dismissed. This creates a frustrating environment for those who came on board expecting to make a difference, only to find their expertise undervalued.\n\nOntra has potential, but its insistence on maintaining a leadership model rooted in its origins rather than evolving to meet the demands of a modern SaaS organization limits its ability to fully leverage the talent it has brought in. For prospective employees, this may be something to carefully consider before joining.\n\nBe prepared to be reprimanded and abused by the former lawyers in leadership. Forget promotions or leadership positions, unless your degree was in law.",

        "cons": "Things were better a few years ago, but within the past two years just about every upper-level manager and executive leader has been replaced, which of course leads to even more turnover within teams. As soon as the dust settles after one big departmental \"restructuring\", another upheaval begins in a different department. This makes it feel like the company is in a constant state of turmoil, which leads to an environment which lacks any sense of job security, cohesion, or trust. Teams are often re-arranged, and priorities change even more.

Contract Automation is also used by dozens of prominent investment banks and offered through partnerships with AM Law 100 firms and service providers. The platform streamlines processes for a variety of M&A and private deal document types, including non-disclosure agreements, non-reliance letters, vendor contracts, and engagement letters, and continues to expand.\n\nDesigned to help private capital markets firms accelerate the negotiation of key contracts and dealmaking, Ontra's Contract Automation offers an end-to-end platform solution that is powered by industry-leading AI. It is an integral part of Ontra's Legal Operating System, purpose-built to automate legal workflows for the private investment industry.\n\nOntra first integrated AI capabilities into Contract Automation in 2016. Adding OpenAI's GPT-4 will allow Ontra to leverage its deep private markets expertise to accelerate expansion into more document types, and power several new and upcoming features to increase the speed of contract negotiations, including:\n\nDigital Playbooks: The digital source of truth for negotiation preferences to ensure seamless collaboration across legal and business teams with data-driven insights into positions' market alignment.\n\nMarkup Builder: AI-enabled markup tool that surfaces precedent, automates redlines, offers side-by-side document comparisons, and generates suggestions at the clause level that are aligned with a customer's digital playbook, substantially reducing editing time.\n\nAutomated Summaries: Fully automated, AI-generated summaries of key legal and business terms that can also accommodate additional customer-specific requests.\n\n\"Reaching our millionth document is an exciting milestone, and one that reflects the deep private markets legal experience embedded across our Legal Operating System,\" said Troy Pospisil, Ontra's CEO and founder. \"We've saved our customers countless hours to date, and on the heels of this achievement, we are excited to integrate additional AI capabilities that further Ontra's mission to accelerate routine contract negotiations, reduce friction in the dealmaking process, and expand to additional document types to save our customers even more time.\"\n\n\"One million contracts processed marks a historic moment for Ontra, and it's just the beginning,\" said Frank Giovinazzo, Ontra's GM of Contract Automation. \"Now, after a decade of handling routine contracts, integrating GPT-4's advanced capabilities means we can reach the next million exponentially faster and usher in a new era of contract management and collaboration.\"\n\nFor private investment firms, managing routine contract negotiations in-house stretches the limits of even the most talented and sophisticated legal teams, diverting attention from sourcing deals, managing investments, and operating the business. Contract Automation solves this challenge by combining an innovative and collaborative AI-powered software platform with a global network of highly trained legal professionals so teams can focus on strategic work.\n\n\"The ability to move efficiently is key to being competitive in private markets, and NDAs are a critical component of the investing process,\" said Jon Korngold, Global Head of Blackstone Growth. \"Ontra's AI-powered solution has helped us reduce significant friction in our processes — this has given our deal teams leverage so we can focus on conducting diligence, building deeper relationships with founders, and being a trusted partner during the next chapter of their growth journeys.\"\n\nFor more information about how Ontra transforms routine contracting for the private capital markets, visit www.ontra.ai.\n\nAbout Ontra\n\nOntra is the global leader in contract automation and intelligence for private capital markets firms.

      "# [Celebrating 10 years of Ontra’s growth and success by Ontra on 2024-10-02](https://www.ontra.ai/blog/celebrating-10-years-of-ontra-growth-and-success/)\nOntra celebrates its 10th anniversary this October! What started out as three friends with a clever idea has grown into an industry-leading AI legal tech platform with 800+ customers, over 1.2 million documents processed, and 300+ employees.\n\nWe couldn’t be prouder of Ontra’s journey and the strides we’ve made in helping investment, legal, and compliance professionals streamline and automate repetitive tasks. Now they can spend their time on what matters most — whether that’s important work or getting home in time for dinner.\n\nOntra’s origins\n\nCEO and founder Troy Pospisil formed the idea for Ontra — previously InCloudCounsel — while working in private equity investing. He loved the industry but saw the inefficiencies. The high volume of repetitive, mundane work. The generic legacy tech. The unnecessary late nights.\n\nTroy knew that modern legal tech could be the solution. He partnered with his friend and Kirkland & Ellis lawyer, Ben Levi, to pursue combining a unique labor model with best-in-class technology with the intention of creating an end-to-end contract negotiation solution.\n\nAlong with their third, tech-focused co-founder, Lane Lillquist, the trio set out to build their first solution, Contract Automation — initially known as Document Processing.\n\nTheir vision was clear: Create a world where professionals have more time to focus on what is important to them. Customers would be free from time-consuming, manual tasks and able to better focus on high-value work, while lawyers could build practices free from traditional employment and geographic constraints.\n\nWhen it came time to sell their unique solution to customers, Troy slept on friends’ couches, stamped hundreds of envelopes, and walked miles across NYC to book meetings. It was a labor of love, sweat, and tears that paid off when Ontra celebrated processing 1,000,000 documents a decade later.\n\nGrowth of Ontra’s private markets technology platform\n\nOntra’s ever-expanding private markets technology platform addresses the full spectrum of legal workflows required to fundraise, invest, and operate funds. Through a combination of purpose-built applications, a proprietary AI engine leveraging leading LLMs, and a global Legal Network, Ontra provides more than 800 customers with innovative solutions backed by years of industry expertise.\n\nContract Automation\n\nCustomers leverage Ontra’s AI-powered platform and a global network of independent law firms to automate and streamline processes related to contract intake, negotiation, and execution.\n\nContract Automation has evolved significantly since the early days of Document Processing. We continue to expand contract types, from NDAs to vendor agreements and LP transfers. Our customers’ lawyers now use digital playbooks, our proprietary AI redlining tool, Markup Builder, and a centralized solution with automated notifications to speed up negotiations. Our AI and GPT-4 integration continue to boost AI-powered features, from markup suggestions to quickly summarizing executed agreements.\n\nOver 700 firms trust Contract Automation, including Blackstone, Apollo, KKR, Carlyle, and Fir Tree Partners. Learn more about how Blackstone closes high-caliber investments faster, and Fir Tree cut negotiation times in half with Ontra.\n\nInsight\n\nThroughout the first six years, Ontra grew to over 50 employees and 300 customers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The business developed close relationships with private fund managers and asset managers and, through these close ties, Ontra discovered growing pain points around side letter management and compliance. Firms had too many side letters and obligations to effectively track in a spreadsheet. The team at Ontraset out to build another solution.\n\nWith Insight, customers leverage AI to digitize their LPAs and side letters and create a central repository. They now have a searchable, digital compendia containing all of their categorized obligations and where they can assign tasks and pull reports to support their compliance efforts. We are continually adding to Insight’s features, such as the recent additions of digital MFN elections and AI Search.\n\nLeading managers worldwide, including Blackstone, Battery Ventures, AllianceBernstein, Silverlake, L Catterton, and Pharos Capital Group, rely on Insight. Learn how Pharos accelerated their SEC exam response with Insight’s search and reporting capabilities.\n\nAtlas\n\nOntra’s most recently launched product modernizes legal entity management to automate Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) filings and other compliance workflows. Once again, Ontra’s growing team focused on a solution that would specifically address our customers’ legal and compliance needs.\n\nOne Equity Partners, Glendower Capital, Ridgemont Equity Partners, and more rely on Atlas to manage their entity information in a single AI-enabled platform, generate customizable structure charts, and automate CTA filings.\n\nSynapse\n\nOntra’s AI engine, Synapse, is a cutting-edge combination of proprietary models and third-party LLMs, including OpenAI’s GPT-4.\n\nSynapse:\n\nIs safe and secure: Customer data is carefully guarded and not used to train third-party models.\n\nIs designed for private markets: Purpose-built for private market contracts and workflows.\n\nGenerates customer-specific results: Data is fetched in real time for quick and relevant results.\n\nRelies on a human-in-the-loop model: Dedicated professionals review AI-generated results.\n\nOur industry-leading AI provides solutions to solve our customers’ unique and complex problems. Synapse enables us to deploy reliable AI features throughout our platform, speeding up legal tasks across the fund lifecycle, lowering costs, and empowering professionals with immediate knowledge of their contracts and obligations.\n\nThe Legal Network\n\nOur global network of independent legal professionals is a key part of our human-in-the-loop philosophy. While AI and legal tech have advanced significantly in the last year — and even recent months — neither can take the place of legal professionals’ insight and judgment.\n\nOur Legal Network features more than 600 legal professionals, giving our customers access to human insight in addition to our AI-powered solutions.\n\nTimeline: Ontra through the years\n\n2014-17: InCloudCounsel launches its Contract Automation solution and opens three offices across the U.S.\n\n2016: InCloudCounsel adds proprietary machine learning to Contract Automation.\n\n2018: InCloudCounsel opens a London office.\n\n2019: InCloudCounsel completes a $40M Series A fundraise with Battery Ventures and opens an office in Asia.\n\n2020: InCloudCounsel grows beyond 50 employees and reaches 300 customers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific.\n\n2021: InCloudCounsel rebrands as Ontra, goes to market with Insight, launches its philanthropic program, The Legal Aid Alliance, and completes a $200M Series B fundraise with Blackstone Growth.\n\n2022: Ontra makes two business acquisitions, grows to over 300 employees, and reaches 500 customers.\n\n2023: Ontra launches Atlas, integrates OpenAI’s GPT-4 into Synapse, and expands The Legal Aid Alliance to Europe and Asia-Pacific.\n\n2024: Ontra reaches over 1 million contracts processed through its solutions and celebrates 10 years.\n\nClosing the justice gap\n\nMany Ontra employees were practicing lawyers in their previous lives and understand the chasm between the need for legal representation and the legal resources available for vulnerable and low-income communities. Ontra believes in playing a part in closing what’s known as “the justice gap.”\n\nWe donate $1 for every document processed through our solutions. In 2023, we donated $292,903 — our highest annual amount to date. It was our first year including documents processed through Insight and the first year we gave our customers the option of Ontra donating an additional sum rather than sending a traditional holiday gift.\n\nIn three years, Ontra’s Legal Aid Alliance has donated over $572,000 to legal aid nonprofits across the U.S.\n\nLooking to the future of AI legal tech\n\nOntra has never strayed from the original vision: To create a world where professionals have more time to focus on what is important to them.",

This foundation of structured and validated data empowers customers to sort, search, and analyze complex legal agreements with confidence. Fund managers can go from a complex question to concrete action faster than ever before.\"\n\nAs a next step, Synapse will enable customers to ask immediate follow-up questions and suggest related workflows based on requirements in their legal documents. Ontra will also extend these capabilities to its broader product suite, enabling users to gather critical knowledge from any contract faster.\n\nSynapse now allows Insight users to:\n\nAsk Insight questions about their agreements\n\nGet quick and actionable answers informed by the full scope of their agreements\n\nExplore supporting obligations with links to relevant reference text and summaries\n\nLeverage search results to create workflows that hold teams accountable\n\nLeading fund managers have signed up to take advantage of Ontra's advanced AI technology to work smarter.
