They're scans, often compound documents (as in documents created at different times added together - a master with appendices and exhibits, or an amendment with schedules, toss in a few Work Orders in between things). As scans, they usually have random handwriting, artifacts, etc. As compound documents, they may have single column then double column, sometimes triple column, then it might switch to landscape orientation for printed spreadsheets tucked into the contract. I've found plenty of OCR that can address each item individually, but nothing that can correctly OCR the entire document. When the doc starts out single column then changes to double or triple column, most OCR ends up giving me single lines across (breaking the columns) which is useless.\nThe next issue is that contracts are stored as PDF, which, for text, means there are returns inserted at the end of each line (and they rarely correspond to the true end of a sentence.) As a result, I have to try to structure regex to look for phrases that may span a line, but I also need to capture the entire clause, which again proves quite difficult with end of line returns inserted throughout. Between the end of line returns and the OCR issues compound the complexity, since it generally means I can't rely on punctuation to be accurate (periods are often OCRd as commas, semicolons as commas, commas as periods, etc.)\n\nIf I have plain text, no OCR issues, and no odd returns throughout, I can handle things beautifully with regex. But the only way I get that is to manually fix the text.\n\n### Comment ID k9xs5r8 with +1 score by [(PLERoss, Reddit, 2023-11-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaltech/comments/17ewo3q/legal_ai_what_have_you_used_reviews/k9xs5r8/) (in reply to ID k9xp061):\nI’ve been looking too!

Unlike many of commenters here I have had great success and have found that being a seasoned Rails dev to be in high demand. That said, I am seeing a trend currently where frontend React devs are highly in demand.\n\nI was on the React train in the early days (2016'ish) and really thought that is was the future of frontend development. This really seems to be where the world has moved recently and React developers are generally in high demand, so it is generally a good skill to have on your resume.\n\nBUT, from what I have learned in my 12 years of being a primarily Rails dev is that DHH is pretty much always 2-3 years ahead of the industry and is almost always right. A lot of people will argue that Rails is \"dead\" but I whole heartedly disagree. I really think what they are doing with modern Javascript is where the future is, and Rails is embracing it and forging the path ahead.\n\nWhen the \"hot new thing\" in React was server side rendering (https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components), it really made me chuckle a bit. This has been the default for Rails since the beginning. Internet speed, browser capabilities, and the maturity of JavaScript has generally made these complicated front end frameworks mostly worthless IMO.\n\nAll that said, I would say learning Rails is a worthwhile endeavor. It's here to stay, and if you are proficient with Laravel it won't be a huge leap to learn Ruby/Rails, and it might even be a delight! It's definitely worth at least a few hours of your time to see if it jives with you. There are lots of opportunities out there.\n\n## Comment ID lu4q0n9 with +1 score by [(dphaener, Reddit, 2024-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/1gc9jh3/id_like_to_learn_rails_but/lu4q0n9/) (in reply to ID 1gc9jh3):\nFor anyone here looking for Rails work, Ontra is hiring a senior rails dev: https://www.ontra.ai/jobs/?gh\\_jid=7633941002.

I don't find the work interesting and the hours are too gruelling. I'm 35F, single, no kids, and frankly not sure any of that is on the cards while I'm still in this job (last long term relationship ended 3 years ago).\n\nAny suggestions welcome on how to manage this transition as undoubtedly starting from scratch in a different field will involve a salary cut.

Do you have annual leave you can take? \n\nGet signed off for one month from your GP for burn out. Take some breathing space. You’ve worked very hard to get to where you are but your mental health is worth more than your income. Let yourself recover and have some space before deciding what to do next. I do acknowledge a month off for burn out in these firms would be very detrimental if you then decided you wanted to stay but resigning would also have the same impact. \n\nDo you like law? Can you imagine liking law? My husband is PQE6 with a great life balance working in house. Lower pay, and there are issues, but 4 day working week, weekends are his, no burn out. When in big firm he was overall more miserable with less life work balance. It might not be that law is the problem and that it’s the firm. You’ll drop salary but still have a good income for a nice life, particularly if you leave London.\n\n### Comment ID kvc5vf5 with +27 score by [(billbabybill, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvc5vf5/) (in reply to ID kvbtf3v):\nI am not convinced that being a lawyer in a corporate environment is for me, I find it really hard to \"care\" about big companies and their commercial interests.

From my perspective, very few people there actually care about the company and none of them are managers. The managers just try to convince to do things for “a greater good” so you put in free overtime and make them look good for their next promotion.\n\nIf you really do care about law, then go in house as others suggest, do the bits that you like on your contracted hours, and go home at 5 and switch off your phone / laptop.\n\nI made a career in a technical specialist field with a STEM background and caring about my employer (a big uk bank) and believing the corporate propaganda caused my burn out. Now I’m a consultant (because I like the work I did / do), earn more, stick to my contracted work time and am overall much happier. \n\nYes, I still suffer from post burn out, but I manage it a lot better and get back on track faster - by simply prioritising my needs over my employer’s or client’s needs. I guess your field is niche enough that skills and experience are hard to come by, so usually people involved can’t complain too hard as they don’t want to alienate you. \n\nAlso, once you set boundaries (especially at the beginning) and stick to them, people are forced to work around and accept it. I had been gaslighted in the past that I needed to prove myself every single day, but after some time realised that people earning more than me did less and sometimes even displayed their slacker attitude, but had no risk of getting fired. You’d be surprised how much of your experience was a result of you trying to be too pleasing to everyone. \n\nOne very last point of advice - go for some form of therapy. I for example tried CBT and al the insights I shared above my therapist brought out to me and really helped to start my mindset changed which (together with the job change and boundary setting) saved my sanity and my high earning job - as a matter of fact, I wasn’t HENRY when I was burnt out, but now am - with less stress. I relate as I come from a working family (did OU as well :) ) and it’s not worth sacrificing many years of high earning potential without trying different solutions first.\n\n#### Comment ID kvc9ht2 with +9 score by [(Kittykittycatcat1000, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvc9ht2/) (in reply to ID kvc5vf5):\nWhat about the civil service?

You are in a mugs game. The hours, stress, nature of the work and utter uselessness of what you do will grind you down. However, you can leave! And you are in an awesome position, you've done a great slog, got the CV stuff and you will walk your next gig. I moved in house and did the industry rounds. If you still want to work the  corporate ladder and want to do variety of work this is the route for you. If you want to FIRE its locum work. This career choice gets a little taking used to as it's so unlike what the people that have trained you would do. But you take complete rein of your own life and get to quit and spend 6 months travelling wherever you want. Also you can work remotely, which means from any destination. If you care about freedom, have no major financial commitments and can live with the ego hit from peers, this one is for you. This is my current choice. \nOther alternatives could be taking a corporate role in the Arab world.

Everyone - and I really do mean everyone - has a patch somewhere between 1-3PQE where the job is horrible. Lots of people leave at that point, but even those who don’t have a wobble around then.

So you’re doing an awful lot of graft with a lot of pressure being placed on you, but no real release valve for it.\n\nYou also tend to be one of the best levels to delegate to because 2-3 PQE is the sweet spot profitability wise.\n\nSo it’s a shitty time in private practice, but if you make it out the other side the job can become pretty fun again.\n\n## Comment ID kvbymk7 with +11 score by [(NormalMaverick, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvbymk7/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nI've often contemplated the same - I know someone who moved from being a strategy consultant in London to a schoolteacher in the North, and she seems happy with her choice. She made a dramatic reduction (70%) reduction to her earnings though.\n\nBeing LENRY is not the only option for you though, there are roles which pay okay (I'm sure someone on Reddit can come up with a catchy name). E.g., instead of earning £140k in PE corporate law at an MC firm, working in-house somewhere for £80-90k.\n\nIt also comes down to you as a person. Would you be happy with a lower earning life, especially seeing your current peers go on to become partners etc.? At the same time, you would have your life to pursue hobbies, relationships, family, side hustles etc.\n\nAvoid making a rash decision because of how crap some days at work are.

I know the feeling. Mine got so bad I would walk to work and think of I got hit by a car or a bus at least I'd be in hospital and couldn't be contacted for a few days / weeks. It felt like there was no escape. \n\nLeaving that company was the best thing that I ever did. I took a job with less responsibility within the same industry and within a month I was no longer burnt out and I missed the responsibility I had. Within 6 months I was yearning for more and felt uninspired. \n\nMy point is, like many others have said, burnout needs tending to. If you can take time off, leave your job or be signed off, then you may find you love your job but it's the relentlessness of it that's having an impact. \n\nLeaving that job was the best thing I ever did. It was so toxic, the hours were insane and the management ground everyone to the floor. When I was in that place (partly due to the management and general nature of the business), it felt like there was no where to go. We were told our competitors were terrible and I felt like I couldn't do the type of work we did anywhere else. \n\nThat was a lie, and I'm better paid, happier and doing better work than I've ever done. If you feel like the company could be the issue - leave, join somewhere which is less intense and you can spend a year or two figuring out what you'd like to do less stressed and with more time to consider. I spent just under 2 years at a new company after I burnt out, and then I took a promotion, a 20% salary increase and now I'm back on my feet and absolutely loving work. \n\nBurnout is no joke. Take it seriously and if you're aware of it and posting about it on Reddit, you need to quit your job and give yourself time to recuperate. You'll be surprised how quickly you return to normal once you're out of the situation!\n\n## Comment ID kvbvm2c with +3 score by [(Menryn1924, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvbvm2c/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nI wasn't a million miles away from your situation, but I didn't walk away from law - just that job.\n\nIf you get a job in-house or at another firm (with a better balance) you can be conservative with the date you can start, and push your firm to either put you on gardening leave or let you leave after less than your full notice period.

Got to 4yrs PQE at MC firm in Corproate law, burnt out and hated it. Quit and after a few months off pivoted and went into teaching. Loved it but after 2-3yrs (and having my first kid) realised the problem was not the law - it was corporate law. \n\nI'm now 4 years into private client practice. During my LPC, wills/probate etc was only given a cursory look in - and naive me at the time thought \"God that sounds so boring\". But turns out I LOVE it. My corporate deals never excited me, could never find it in myself to be excited about my deals on the front page of the FT. Now my job is PEOPLE, and it is personal to them, and I feel like I can help at what can be really difficult times of their lives. It's also highly technical so intellectually stimulating.\n\nIt has its moments, but mostly the job is 9 - 5.30, and I go home and have time with my family (which never would have happened if I hadn't left the city). It's non-transactional and not court based so it's totally feasible to do part time (I do 4 days pw). Of course the pay is never going to be anything like corporate- but I have a life now and that is more than worth the reduction in pay. \n\nDon't regret teaching but part of me wished I had take more time to think and pivoted then by changing specialisms!

The hours are a lot more 9-5, except for when deals are going through but it’s nothing compared to private practice. You will undoubtedly have to take a pay cut but in house 2 PQE legal counsel can expect £110-150k base, with a bonus and generous carried interest/ shares schemes.

It is both a mental and physical thing. I read a study a long time ago that said that the physical side of burnout is from not having enough serotonin precursor, so I took 5htp (which turns into serotonin precursor) and I immediately felt better.\n\nI would've quit my job. Now I do that job on top of another pretty much full time job, and despite working every hour there is I generally feel alright. Far far better than I did with just HALF of the workload. \n\nAnd I don't have to take 5htp every day.

And so if that other job is in any way unsatisfactory it'll feel like you made a bad call as in the moment you're still unhappy you just get paid less now. That plus the downsides of earning less.\n\n## Comment ID kvcpzfl with +1 score by [(0xa9059cbb, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvcpzfl/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nIt's not worth burning out over a £140k salary. The way I see it my health is the number one priority always, I choose to earn more money so I can afford to live a healthier lifestyle and to afford better health care but if my career starts to negatively impact my health too much it's not serving its purpose.\n\nI would say the main question to ask is whether you have a reasonable chance of getting promoted to a partner level position or equivalent (i.e. to get significant profit share). If the answer is yes it may be worth grinding for a while longer to get there, otherwise there are plenty of less stressful ways to make money.\n\n## Comment ID kvcqjug with +1 score by [(ThrowThrow_24, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvcqjug/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nMany people here are suggesting taking a sabbatical.

Working at a law firm looks pretty awful, they are toxic and the pressure on billable hours means no escape from burnout. \n\nLook at moving in-house in a company somewhere so you can keep using your training. I work in biotech / pharma and the general counsel seem to have a much better time, they are closely involved with the company's strategy so it's intellectually interesting work, but they don't have to sell their time.

It’s tough when you’re tired and burnt out but I tend to catastrophise when in that position. Can you make some small changes?

Also don’t feel like you’ve failed. You’re doing exceptionally well! You are off to a great start and still young and you’ve recognised what’s important to you.

Yes, you have a good job, and pays you well but there are so many companies like that out there. They are not precious, your mind is, that's what makes you the money - so you need to protect it!   Second decide if it's the firm / sector or the job itself you don't like - might be better to work in another potentially low paying job to suss it out.  I was burnt out years back and wanted to leave everything and train as a teacher, however found a similar job in a different sector  - been very happy!  Maybe start interviewing and see how you feel.   Third, you should be able to get a mortgage in principle before leaving in case you wanted to buy a house and the next low paying job doesn't give you enough loan power ( also consider the probation period ).\n\n## Comment ID kvfuyis with +1 score by [(trbd003, Reddit, 2024-03-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvfuyis/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nCould you take some time out - either as a formal sabbatical from your job or just leave without having a job to go to?

Right now I think you'd romanticise the idea of working in McDonald's, just to give yourself a break.\n\nTaking a break doesn't have to mean giving up everything you've earned yourself.

While this background brought deep industry knowledge, it also introduced significant challenges in building a technology-first company.\n\nTo their credit, the company recognized some of these gaps and underwent a restructuring, bringing in experienced professionals with robust backgrounds in tech and SaaS. However, the impact of this positive change is stifled by the company’s structure. Despite hiring these capable individuals, the original leadership—composed of former lawyers—remains in ultimate control.\n\nAs a result, even though the newly hired experts often propose innovative ideas, valuable feedback, and strategic improvements, their suggestions are frequently sidelined or dismissed. This creates a frustrating environment for those who came on board expecting to make a difference, only to find their expertise undervalued.\n\nOntra has potential, but its insistence on maintaining a leadership model rooted in its origins rather than evolving to meet the demands of a modern SaaS organization limits its ability to fully leverage the talent it has brought in. For prospective employees, this may be something to carefully consider before joining.\n\nBe prepared to be reprimanded and abused by the former lawyers in leadership. Forget promotions or leadership positions, unless your degree was in law.",

A certain leader went on a listening tour and spoke for 23 minutes out of the 25 minutes allotted for listening to an employee. So you can imagine how much the leadership cares about its employees. One manager's modus operandi is to fire people on her team every few months. Good luck if you are on her team. Workload has increased, or in some cases, tripled, and pay has in fact decreased. Another leader claims that a certain task can be completed in 2 hours, whereas in reality it can take an entire week. Of course, that leader has never done any work at the ground level. Work gets dumped on you all the time!!",

Everyone genuinely cares about each other and helping their teams succeed. We function as a true collaborative team. Not to mention, whenever I need help or am uncertain of something either my manager, leadership, or the people team have been happy to take the time to support.\n\nOntra truly feels like a place I can grow and build a long term career at. \n\nThe last thing I want to mention is how nice it is that senior leadership connects with all levels of employees.

          "cons": "It becomes apparent early on that transparency and fairness, which were promised upfront, are nothing but empty words. Despite being quoted a specific compensation upon accepting the position, the actual earnings fell far short, and there was no effort to rectify this discrepancy. The disparity in salaries between employees at different levels, even when their job responsibilities are identical, is a major concern. The company avoids addressing these glaring discrepancies and crucial employee questions, such as the absence of a 401k match, during company-wide meetings. Management's response to salary adjustments has been nothing short of a constant stream of excuses. Despite initial claims that salaries were \"above market\" or competitive, these assertions fail to acknowledge the impact of inflation over time. What might have seemed like a favorable salary upon joining the company loses its advantage as the cost of living increases. In reality, employees are now faced with a disheartening choice, realizing that despite the excuses provided, they are effectively experiencing a salary reduction of over 10% due to the soaring cost of living. On top of the favoritism and broken promises, another disillusioning aspect of working at this company was the current lack of promotion opportunities. During the hiring process, they boasted about a high likelihood of upward mobility within a year, creating a sense of optimism among new employees. However, as time went on, it became evident that these promises were nothing more than empty assurances. The path to advancement has been riddled with obstacles. The lack of career growth opportunities and the feeling of being stuck in the same role for an extended period has added to the growing dissatisfaction with the company's management and their lack of commitment to their own promises. The most significant problem within this company is the rampant favoritism displayed by higher-ups. The issue of favoritism extends to the leadership team, where it is evident that many members of the c-suite surround themselves with friends. Consequently, any problems or concerns are either ignored or inadequately addressed, further contributing to a toxic work environment. Attempts to raise concerns to people partners about favoritism or any other issues proved futile, as they merely took note of the problem without offering any resolution. The lack of accountability and disregard for employee feedback further exacerbated the discontent. One incident that particularly highlighted the lack of accountability within the company was when a leader used a slur during a weekly team meeting. The company took an unreasonably long time to issue an apology, which, when it finally came, felt insincere and failed to hold the leader accountable for their behavior.",

This is pretty normal for a company in this stage of growth - and part of what can be exciting for some people about working in earlier stage / high growth companies. However, it's not for everyone - and can be a tough place for people who don't want to learn about the industry / end customers, have a \"clock-in / clock-out\" mindset or don't do well with change.

        "cons": "It becomes apparent early on that transparency and fairness, which were promised upfront, are nothing but empty words. Despite being quoted a specific compensation upon accepting the position, the actual earnings fell far short, and there was no effort to rectify this discrepancy. The disparity in salaries between employees at different levels, even when their job responsibilities are identical, is a major concern. The company avoids addressing these glaring discrepancies and crucial employee questions, such as the absence of a 401k match, during company-wide meetings. Management's response to salary adjustments has been nothing short of a constant stream of excuses. Despite initial claims that salaries were \"above market\" or competitive, these assertions fail to acknowledge the impact of inflation over time. What might have seemed like a favorable salary upon joining the company loses its advantage as the cost of living increases. In reality, employees are now faced with a disheartening choice, realizing that despite the excuses provided, they are effectively experiencing a salary reduction of over 10% due to the soaring cost of living. On top of the favoritism and broken promises, another disillusioning aspect of working at this company was the current lack of promotion opportunities. During the hiring process, they boasted about a high likelihood of upward mobility within a year, creating a sense of optimism among new employees. However, as time went on, it became evident that these promises were nothing more than empty assurances. The path to advancement has been riddled with obstacles. The lack of career growth opportunities and the feeling of being stuck in the same role for an extended period has added to the growing dissatisfaction with the company's management and their lack of commitment to their own promises. The most significant problem within this company is the rampant favoritism displayed by higher-ups. The issue of favoritism extends to the leadership team, where it is evident that many members of the c-suite surround themselves with friends. Consequently, any problems or concerns are either ignored or inadequately addressed, further contributing to a toxic work environment. Attempts to raise concerns to people partners about favoritism or any other issues proved futile, as they merely took note of the problem without offering any resolution. The lack of accountability and disregard for employee feedback further exacerbated the discontent. One incident that particularly highlighted the lack of accountability within the company was when a leader used a slur during a weekly team meeting. The company took an unreasonably long time to issue an apology, which, when it finally came, felt insincere and failed to hold the leader accountable for their behavior.",

It’s time to foster a culture that values and respects all voices equally.",
        "cons": "Ontra is an organization with a unique founding story—created and run by former lawyers who initially had no technical or SaaS experience. While this background brought deep industry knowledge, it also introduced significant challenges in building a technology-first company.\n\nTo their credit, the company recognized some of these gaps and underwent a restructuring, bringing in experienced professionals with robust backgrounds in tech and SaaS. However, the impact of this positive change is stifled by the company’s structure. Despite hiring these capable individuals, the original leadership—composed of former lawyers—remains in ultimate control.\n\nAs a result, even though the newly hired experts often propose innovative ideas, valuable feedback, and strategic improvements, their suggestions are frequently sidelined or dismissed. This creates a frustrating environment for those who came on board expecting to make a difference, only to find their expertise undervalued.\n\nOntra has potential, but its insistence on maintaining a leadership model rooted in its origins rather than evolving to meet the demands of a modern SaaS organization limits its ability to fully leverage the talent it has brought in. For prospective employees, this may be something to carefully consider before joining.\n\nBe prepared to be reprimanded and abused by the former lawyers in leadership. Forget promotions or leadership positions, unless your degree was in law.",

It's too much.",
        "cons": "Things were better a few years ago, but within the past two years just about every upper-level manager and executive leader has been replaced, which of course leads to even more turnover within teams. As soon as the dust settles after one big departmental \"restructuring\", another upheaval begins in a different department. This makes it feel like the company is in a constant state of turmoil, which leads to an environment which lacks any sense of job security, cohesion, or trust. Teams are often re-arranged, and priorities change even more.

Contract Automation is also used by dozens of prominent investment banks and offered through partnerships with AM Law 100 firms and service providers. The platform streamlines processes for a variety of M&A and private deal document types, including non-disclosure agreements, non-reliance letters, vendor contracts, and engagement letters, and continues to expand.\n\nDesigned to help private capital markets firms accelerate the negotiation of key contracts and dealmaking, Ontra's Contract Automation offers an end-to-end platform solution that is powered by industry-leading AI. It is an integral part of Ontra's Legal Operating System, purpose-built to automate legal workflows for the private investment industry.\n\nOntra first integrated AI capabilities into Contract Automation in 2016. Adding OpenAI's GPT-4 will allow Ontra to leverage its deep private markets expertise to accelerate expansion into more document types, and power several new and upcoming features to increase the speed of contract negotiations, including:\n\nDigital Playbooks: The digital source of truth for negotiation preferences to ensure seamless collaboration across legal and business teams with data-driven insights into positions' market alignment.\n\nMarkup Builder: AI-enabled markup tool that surfaces precedent, automates redlines, offers side-by-side document comparisons, and generates suggestions at the clause level that are aligned with a customer's digital playbook, substantially reducing editing time.\n\nAutomated Summaries: Fully automated, AI-generated summaries of key legal and business terms that can also accommodate additional customer-specific requests.\n\n\"Reaching our millionth document is an exciting milestone, and one that reflects the deep private markets legal experience embedded across our Legal Operating System,\" said Troy Pospisil, Ontra's CEO and founder. \"We've saved our customers countless hours to date, and on the heels of this achievement, we are excited to integrate additional AI capabilities that further Ontra's mission to accelerate routine contract negotiations, reduce friction in the dealmaking process, and expand to additional document types to save our customers even more time.\"\n\n\"One million contracts processed marks a historic moment for Ontra, and it's just the beginning,\" said Frank Giovinazzo, Ontra's GM of Contract Automation. \"Now, after a decade of handling routine contracts, integrating GPT-4's advanced capabilities means we can reach the next million exponentially faster and usher in a new era of contract management and collaboration.\"\n\nFor private investment firms, managing routine contract negotiations in-house stretches the limits of even the most talented and sophisticated legal teams, diverting attention from sourcing deals, managing investments, and operating the business. Contract Automation solves this challenge by combining an innovative and collaborative AI-powered software platform with a global network of highly trained legal professionals so teams can focus on strategic work.\n\n\"The ability to move efficiently is key to being competitive in private markets, and NDAs are a critical component of the investing process,\" said Jon Korngold, Global Head of Blackstone Growth. \"Ontra's AI-powered solution has helped us reduce significant friction in our processes — this has given our deal teams leverage so we can focus on conducting diligence, building deeper relationships with founders, and being a trusted partner during the next chapter of their growth journeys.\"\n\nFor more information about how Ontra transforms routine contracting for the private capital markets, visit www.ontra.ai.\n\nAbout Ontra\n\nOntra is the global leader in contract automation and intelligence for private capital markets firms.

      "# [Celebrating 10 years of Ontra’s growth and success by Ontra on 2024-10-02](https://www.ontra.ai/blog/celebrating-10-years-of-ontra-growth-and-success/)\nOntra celebrates its 10th anniversary this October! What started out as three friends with a clever idea has grown into an industry-leading AI legal tech platform with 800+ customers, over 1.2 million documents processed, and 300+ employees.\n\nWe couldn’t be prouder of Ontra’s journey and the strides we’ve made in helping investment, legal, and compliance professionals streamline and automate repetitive tasks. Now they can spend their time on what matters most — whether that’s important work or getting home in time for dinner.\n\nOntra’s origins\n\nCEO and founder Troy Pospisil formed the idea for Ontra — previously InCloudCounsel — while working in private equity investing. He loved the industry but saw the inefficiencies. The high volume of repetitive, mundane work. The generic legacy tech. The unnecessary late nights.\n\nTroy knew that modern legal tech could be the solution. He partnered with his friend and Kirkland & Ellis lawyer, Ben Levi, to pursue combining a unique labor model with best-in-class technology with the intention of creating an end-to-end contract negotiation solution.\n\nAlong with their third, tech-focused co-founder, Lane Lillquist, the trio set out to build their first solution, Contract Automation — initially known as Document Processing.\n\nTheir vision was clear: Create a world where professionals have more time to focus on what is important to them. Customers would be free from time-consuming, manual tasks and able to better focus on high-value work, while lawyers could build practices free from traditional employment and geographic constraints.\n\nWhen it came time to sell their unique solution to customers, Troy slept on friends’ couches, stamped hundreds of envelopes, and walked miles across NYC to book meetings. It was a labor of love, sweat, and tears that paid off when Ontra celebrated processing 1,000,000 documents a decade later.\n\nGrowth of Ontra’s private markets technology platform\n\nOntra’s ever-expanding private markets technology platform addresses the full spectrum of legal workflows required to fundraise, invest, and operate funds. Through a combination of purpose-built applications, a proprietary AI engine leveraging leading LLMs, and a global Legal Network, Ontra provides more than 800 customers with innovative solutions backed by years of industry expertise.\n\nContract Automation\n\nCustomers leverage Ontra’s AI-powered platform and a global network of independent law firms to automate and streamline processes related to contract intake, negotiation, and execution.\n\nContract Automation has evolved significantly since the early days of Document Processing. We continue to expand contract types, from NDAs to vendor agreements and LP transfers. Our customers’ lawyers now use digital playbooks, our proprietary AI redlining tool, Markup Builder, and a centralized solution with automated notifications to speed up negotiations. Our AI and GPT-4 integration continue to boost AI-powered features, from markup suggestions to quickly summarizing executed agreements.\n\nOver 700 firms trust Contract Automation, including Blackstone, Apollo, KKR, Carlyle, and Fir Tree Partners. Learn more about how Blackstone closes high-caliber investments faster, and Fir Tree cut negotiation times in half with Ontra.\n\nInsight\n\nThroughout the first six years, Ontra grew to over 50 employees and 300 customers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The business developed close relationships with private fund managers and asset managers and, through these close ties, Ontra discovered growing pain points around side letter management and compliance. Firms had too many side letters and obligations to effectively track in a spreadsheet. The team at Ontraset out to build another solution.\n\nWith Insight, customers leverage AI to digitize their LPAs and side letters and create a central repository. They now have a searchable, digital compendia containing all of their categorized obligations and where they can assign tasks and pull reports to support their compliance efforts. We are continually adding to Insight’s features, such as the recent additions of digital MFN elections and AI Search.\n\nLeading managers worldwide, including Blackstone, Battery Ventures, AllianceBernstein, Silverlake, L Catterton, and Pharos Capital Group, rely on Insight. Learn how Pharos accelerated their SEC exam response with Insight’s search and reporting capabilities.\n\nAtlas\n\nOntra’s most recently launched product modernizes legal entity management to automate Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) filings and other compliance workflows. Once again, Ontra’s growing team focused on a solution that would specifically address our customers’ legal and compliance needs.\n\nOne Equity Partners, Glendower Capital, Ridgemont Equity Partners, and more rely on Atlas to manage their entity information in a single AI-enabled platform, generate customizable structure charts, and automate CTA filings.\n\nSynapse\n\nOntra’s AI engine, Synapse, is a cutting-edge combination of proprietary models and third-party LLMs, including OpenAI’s GPT-4.\n\nSynapse:\n\nIs safe and secure: Customer data is carefully guarded and not used to train third-party models.\n\nIs designed for private markets: Purpose-built for private market contracts and workflows.\n\nGenerates customer-specific results: Data is fetched in real time for quick and relevant results.\n\nRelies on a human-in-the-loop model: Dedicated professionals review AI-generated results.\n\nOur industry-leading AI provides solutions to solve our customers’ unique and complex problems. Synapse enables us to deploy reliable AI features throughout our platform, speeding up legal tasks across the fund lifecycle, lowering costs, and empowering professionals with immediate knowledge of their contracts and obligations.\n\nThe Legal Network\n\nOur global network of independent legal professionals is a key part of our human-in-the-loop philosophy. While AI and legal tech have advanced significantly in the last year — and even recent months — neither can take the place of legal professionals’ insight and judgment.\n\nOur Legal Network features more than 600 legal professionals, giving our customers access to human insight in addition to our AI-powered solutions.\n\nTimeline: Ontra through the years\n\n2014-17: InCloudCounsel launches its Contract Automation solution and opens three offices across the U.S.\n\n2016: InCloudCounsel adds proprietary machine learning to Contract Automation.\n\n2018: InCloudCounsel opens a London office.\n\n2019: InCloudCounsel completes a $40M Series A fundraise with Battery Ventures and opens an office in Asia.\n\n2020: InCloudCounsel grows beyond 50 employees and reaches 300 customers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific.\n\n2021: InCloudCounsel rebrands as Ontra, goes to market with Insight, launches its philanthropic program, The Legal Aid Alliance, and completes a $200M Series B fundraise with Blackstone Growth.\n\n2022: Ontra makes two business acquisitions, grows to over 300 employees, and reaches 500 customers.\n\n2023: Ontra launches Atlas, integrates OpenAI’s GPT-4 into Synapse, and expands The Legal Aid Alliance to Europe and Asia-Pacific.\n\n2024: Ontra reaches over 1 million contracts processed through its solutions and celebrates 10 years.\n\nClosing the justice gap\n\nMany Ontra employees were practicing lawyers in their previous lives and understand the chasm between the need for legal representation and the legal resources available for vulnerable and low-income communities. Ontra believes in playing a part in closing what’s known as “the justice gap.”\n\nWe donate $1 for every document processed through our solutions. In 2023, we donated $292,903 — our highest annual amount to date. It was our first year including documents processed through Insight and the first year we gave our customers the option of Ontra donating an additional sum rather than sending a traditional holiday gift.\n\nIn three years, Ontra’s Legal Aid Alliance has donated over $572,000 to legal aid nonprofits across the U.S.\n\nLooking to the future of AI legal tech\n\nOntra has never strayed from the original vision: To create a world where professionals have more time to focus on what is important to them.",

      "# [Ontra’s Insight, Powered By GPT by Ethan Beberness, Jennifer Petersen, Kathryn Rubino, Tahmina Watson, Liz Dye, Source: Lawline CLE, Source: THOMSON, Source: Above The Law on 2024-01-25](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/ontras-insight-powered-by-gpt-4-simplifies-fund-management/)\nSince the initial release of OpenAI’s GPT large language model in 2022, developments in generative AI have transformed how the professional services industry conducts business, presenting new avenues for increasing efficiency and shifting workflows.\n\nOntra, the leader in AI-powered private markets contract automation and intelligence, has long leveraged machine learning and AI for its products, including its cutting-edge Insight product. Now, however, the company has added GPT-4 capabilities to the AI that powers Insight, taking Insight’s ability to help private markets professionals manage fund and side letter obligations and compliance to the next level.\n\nAbove the Law recently spoke with Ontra’s SVP of Engineering, Eric Hawkins to learn more about how integrating GPT-4 into the Insight product bolsters the already powerful tool.\n\nTransforming Contract Management in Private Markets With GPT-4\n\nTraditionally, private markets firms managed key documents on paper, in PDF form, and in antiquated filing systems. With Insight and its addition of GPT-4, however, private markets professionals can access a digital repository of their key fund documents and no longer need to search through those PDF documents individually to surface core terms and information, according to Hawkins.\n\n“Insight takes complex fund data and structures it in a way that makes it easy to find the answers to your questions, to compare provisions, to understand what you’ve agreed to, and what you have to comply with,” Hawkins explains.\n\n“It empowers multiple teams to work and collaborate more efficiently and bolster firm compliance in the face of increasing regulatory scrutiny.”\n\nPrivate markets professionals can search this structured repository of data, which includes limited partnership agreements, side letters, and other fund documents relevant to GPs’ obligations to investors, using the product’s SmartSearch feature. This feature empowers private markets professionals to quickly find and compare examples of past versions of a particular provision or agreement. Having that precedent on hand enables firms to negotiate better outcomes.\n\nDelivering Better, Faster Workflows\n\nInsight benefits private markets professionals by sorting and clustering the vast amount of data necessary for managing private funds. This allows not only for a single source of truth, but also for the development of better, more efficient workflows.\n\n“Insight consolidates all of that information across your fund docs and then lets you, as a private equity or legal professional helping private funds, have a more consolidated view of your obligations and commitments and build efficient workflows that keep you compliant,” Hawkins explains. “It lets you be efficient relative to the things you have to do for your LPs in particular.”\n\nThose better workflows can be built across multiple teams and can take into account variation between different versions of an agreement for different investors, Hawkins emphasizes.\n\nHe notes the ability to quickly pull up documents related to specific arrangements also allows private markets teams to stay agile during event-based occurrences that may trigger springing obligations. Additionally, he explains teams can integrate Insight into workflows relevant to every part of private fund management, from fundraising and MFN elections to ongoing investor and fund reporting and obligation management.\n\nHawkins also adds that teams can export data and reports from Insight, a feature he notes can be particularly helpful when asset managers prepare for mock and regular audits.\n\nAn AI Tool With A Human Touch\n\nUnlike many technology companies that utilize only AI for their main products, Ontra draws on the skills of a dedicated network of legal and private markets professionals — called “human-in-the-loop” experts — as an extra set of eyes to review the accuracy and relevancy of AI outputs.\n\nPrivate markets firms often begin by uploading fund documents via Insight to categorize and summarize the obligations contained therein. When this happens, as Hawkins explains, a specialist reviews and approves the obligations listed by Insight’s output, overriding, editing, or approving the suggestions as needed.\n\n“We basically take all of this structured data from Insight and put it in front of one of our trusted humans-in-the-loop, and they can very quickly review this and reduce the time it takes to digitize agreements,” adds Hawkins.\n\n“They can go through the whole document and can see the AI recommendations, then they can say ‘Yep, this looks right,’ or ‘This wasn’t quite right, let me touch it up a bit.’” he says. “Anybody can feed a document to ChatGPT, but storing and managing that data in a way that is useful to your firm is the magic that happens here.”\n\nHigh Speed, High Security\n\nWhen adopting any type of AI-based tool into day-to-day operations, security should be top of mind for any private markets firm.\n\nThe integration of GPT-4 into Insight was conducted with a focus on security.\n\n“None of the data we use to prompt OpenAI models will ever be used [by OpenAI] in subsequent training runs,” Hawkins states. “As a customer of OpenAI, Ontra was able to implement zero data retention for our customers, which means the basic data uploaded when a customer prompts GPT is immediately forgotten by OpenAI.”\n\nIn addition to the agreement between Ontra and OpenAI, Insight also adheres to the SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria for Security, a security framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to minimize the risk of data breaches.",

The findings were concurrently published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the Heart Rhythm Society's annual meeting, Heart Rhythm 2024.The recent development will likely bolster Boston Scientific’s Cardiovascular business.About mCRM SystemThe device is designed to communicate wirelessly to coordinate painless intracardiac anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) therapy, provide rate-responsive bradycardia pacing support and prevent sudden cardiac death without the use of leads in the heart or under the sternum.The company anticipates FDA approval of the mCRM System in 2025. Study DetailsThe trial assessed not only the safety and functionality of the EMPOWER LP as a stand-alone pacemaker but also the efficacy of the EMBLEM S-ICD System in wirelessly requesting the LP to administer ATP treatment. The trial's results satisfied all predetermined six-month safety and efficacy criteria.The trial's results met all pre-established six-month safety and effectiveness endpoints. They showed that the EMPOWER Leadless Pacemaker was implanted with a major complication-free rate of 97.5%, that communication between the EMBLEM S-ICD System and the EMPOWER Leadless Pacemaker was successful in 98.8% of cases, that anti-tachycardia pacing was successful in 61.3% of cases and that no patient requested that anti-tachycardia pacing or bradycardia pacing be turned off because of pain or discomfort.Study Outcome BenefitsBoston Scientific observed outstanding overall clinical performance of the mCRM System in this trial, including a high rate of successful communication from the S-ICD to the leadless pacemaker and a low rate of serious leadless pacemaker problems. These findings are significant because the high percentages of communication success and pain-free termination of spontaneous arrhythmia episodes suggest a potential upgrade pathway for patients currently implanted with an S-ICD who require ATP or pacing.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInstead of exposing all patients to the risks of more invasive approaches, such as placing leads into the heart or tunneling them under the sternum to provide therapies they may not need, these findings suggest physicians may be able to tailor therapy to the patient's specific needs and health.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global cardiac rhythm management devices market size was estimated at $16.43 billion in 2023 and is expected to register a CAGR of 6.3% from 2024 to 2030. The growing prevalence of various cardiovascular diseases, such as arrhythmia and atrial fibrillation, among others.Other Notable HighlightsIn February 2024, Boston Scientific gained the FDA’s approval for the FARAPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) system, which is indicated for the isolation of pulmonary veins in the treatment of drug-refractory, recurrent, symptomatic, paroxysmal (i.e., intermittent) atrial fibrillation. The system represents a unique new alternative to standard-of-care thermal ablation treatment.Earlier in 2023, Boston Scientific completed enrollment in the first phase of the ADVANTAGE AF clinical trial, which is studying the FARAPULSE PFA system for treating patients with drug-refractory, symptomatic, persistent AF. The company also commenced enrollment in a second phase of the study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the adjunctive use of the FARAPOINT PFA Catheter for cavotricuspid isthmus ablations — a procedure used to treat atrial flutter.
