To exercise the rights described in this Privacy Policy, please contact us as described below.\n\nData Security\n\nWe seek to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of personal data and how we are processing that data.\n\nYou should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the internet or storing data is completely secure.\n\nData Retention\n\nWe retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide you with our Services or to perform our business or commercial purposes for collecting personal data, subject to the data deletion rights of various state privacy laws, detailed below.\n\nWhen establishing a retention period for specific categories of data, we consider who we collected the data from, our need for the personal data, why we collected the personal data, and the sensitivity of the personal data. In some cases we retain personal data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information is no longer personal data.\n\nFor example:\n\nWe may retain your payment data for as long as we need to process your purchase or subscription or as long as required for our compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nWe may retain sensitive personal information (such as your SSN or identification verification information) for as long as we need to provide you with the Services or as long as required for our compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nPersonal Data of Children\n\nAs noted in the Terms of Service, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data about children under 18 years of age; if you are a child under the age of 18, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any personal data. If we learn we have collected personal data from a child under 18 years of age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 18 years of age may have provided personal data to us, please contact us as described below.\n\nInternational Data Transfers\n\nAll information processed by us may be transferred, processed, and stored anywhere in the world, including, but not limited to, the United States or other countries, which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live. We endeavor to safeguard your information consistent with the requirements of applicable laws.\n\nAccessibility\n\nThis Privacy Policy uses industry-standard technologies and was developed in line with the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, version 2.1. If you wish to print this policy, please do so from your web browser. If you need further assistance regarding the accessibility of this webpage, please contact us as described below.\n\nUpdates to this Policy\n\nAs we continually work to improve our Services, we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Upon such changes, we will alert you to any such changes by placing a notice on the Ontra website and/or by sending you an email.\n\nSupplemental California Notice\n\nPersonal Data Disclosures\n\nWe disclose personal data for business purposes as follows:\n\nCategory of Personal Data\n\nExamples of Personal Data We Collect\n\nCategories of Third Parties To Whom We Disclose Personal Data for Business Purposes\n\nUnder the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (together, the “CCPA”), sharing your data through third party cookies for online and cross-contextual behavioral advertising may be considered a “share” of personal information.\n\nWe share your personal data for the purposes of cross-contextual behavioral advertising with the following categories of third parties:\n\nCategory of Personal Data\n\nExamples of Personal Data We Collect\n\nCategories of Third Parties To Whom We Sell/Share Personal Data\n\nWe do not sell personal information for monetary or other valuable consideration.\n\nTo our knowledge, we do not sell or share the personal data of minors under 18 years of age for any purpose, including cross-contextual behavioral advertising and targeted advertising.\n\nSensitive Data\n\nWe only use or disclose your sensitive personal information for the purposes set forth in section 7027(l) of the CCPA proposed regulations and we do not collect or process sensitive personal information with the purpose of inferring any characteristics about you.\n\nNon-Discrimination\n\nWe will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. However, we may offer different tiers of our Services as allowed by applicable data privacy laws (including the CCPA) with varying prices, rates or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of personal data that we receive from you.\n\nAuthorized Agents\n\nIf you are a California resident, you may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.\n\nSupplemental European Union and United Kingdom Notice\n\nEU and UK Residents\n\nIf you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom (“UK”), Lichtenstein, Norway or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU or UK General Data Protection Regulation (together, “GDPR”) with respect to your personal data, as outlined below.\n\nLawful Bases for Processing\n\nWe will only process your personal data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity and our “legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of others, as further described below.\n\nContractual Necessity: We process the following categories of personal data as a matter of “contractual necessity”, meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Service with you, which enables us to provide you with the Services. When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such personal data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require such data.\n\nProfile or contact information\n\nIdentifiers\n\nPayment data\n\nDevice/IP data\n\nOther personal data you choose to provide\n\nLegitimate Interest: We process the following categories of personal data when we believe it furthers the legitimate interest of us or third parties:\n\nProfile or contact information\n\nIdentifiers\n\nPayment Data\n\nDevice/IP data\n\nAnalytics data\n\nGeolocation Data\n\nOther personal data you choose to provide\n\nWe may also de-identify or anonymize personal data to further our legitimate interests\n\nExamples of these legitimate interests include (as described in more detail above):\n\nProviding, customizing, and improving the Services\n\nMarketing the Services\n\nCorresponding with you\n\nProvision of customer support\n\nProtecting from fraud or security threats\n\nMeeting legal requirements and enforcing legal terms\n\nCompleting corporate transactions\n\nConsent: In some cases and where required by law, we may collect or process personal data based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such data. When we process personal data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection.\n\nOther Processing Grounds: From time to time we may also need to process personal data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.\n\nTransfers of Personal Data\n\nThe Services are hosted and operated in the United States (“U.S.”) through Ontra and its service providers, and if you do not reside in the U.S., laws in the U.S. may differ from the laws where you reside. By using the Services, you acknowledge that any personal data about you, regardless of whether provided by you or obtained from a third party, is being provided to Ontra in the U.S. and will be hosted on U.S. servers, and you authorize Ontra to transfer, store and process your information to and in the U.S., and possibly other countries. In some circumstances, your personal data may be transferred to the U.S. pursuant to a data processing agreement incorporating standard data protection clauses.\n\nEU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework\n\nOntra complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively, “DPF”).\n\nOntra has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, including the principles of 1) notice, 2) choice, 3) accountability for onward transfer, 4) security, 5) data integrity and purpose limitation, 6) access, and 7) recourse, enforcement, and liability. Ontra has also certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.\n\nThe DPF Principles require that we remain potentially liable if any third party processing personal data on our behalf fails to comply with these DPF Principles (except to the extent we are not responsible for the event giving rise to any alleged damage). Ontra’s compliance with the DPF is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\n\nPlease contact us as described below with any questions or concerns relating to our DPF Certification. In compliance with the DPF, Ontra commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the DPF to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, you may also be entitled to invoke binding arbitration for complaints not resolved by other means.\n\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.

Not really a startup now that it is 10 years old. We went through a hiring boom (1 new person every 2-4 weeks it seemed).\n\nDuring that time our 1 recruiter was pretty essential in scheduling, interviews, onboarding, etc... At my old job we didn't have one, and they were all baffled because nobody was applying to the position (not amazing location, unknown company for SI/PI research). There has to be some university outreach, marketing, and filtering to get quality people into the company while not swamping tech leads with technical interviews. Super easy for huge companies with name recognition, much harder for smaller companies.\n\nPersonally I think having one or two HR/recruiters can be good to market your company properly to get good talent. Also to do the busywork of sifting through resumes. The project managers and engineers, at my company at least, have no time for that...\n\n#### Comment ID jap08b7 with +22 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkedInLunatics/comments/11gbf6l/recently_laid_off_recruiters_getting_the_taste_of/jap08b7/) (in reply to ID janwt8x):\nIts the only job my dad could keep lmfao\n\n#### Comment ID jaqlful with +4 score by [(thingsliveundermybed, Reddit, 2023-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkedInLunatics/comments/11gbf6l/recently_laid_off_recruiters_getting_the_taste_of/jaqlful/) (in reply to ID janwt8x):\nI don't know which country you're in, but that applies to a hell of a lot of them.\n\n### Comment ID jaoyuzh with +65 score by [(badmanner66, Reddit, 2023-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkedInLunatics/comments/11gbf6l/recently_laid_off_recruiters_getting_the_taste_of/jaoyuzh/) (in reply to ID janrd1j):\nIf you can't do, teach.

Recruiting is a mission critical function at any company that regularly hires. And no, it’s not something HR should just do- two surprisingly different profiles for those jobs. A good recruiter is worth their weight in gold. \n\nOn the latter point you’re totally right. That sector was *absurdly* inflated the last few years, hence this massive culling. A lot of these people are going to have to switch careers, because it’s never going back to the way it was in 2020-2022. \n\nAnd yes- unfortunately there are still some real bad apples.

They then told me that it’s not a good quality when people talk about money, I said ok and didn’t take up the second round of the interview I was offered.  \n\nYesterday I saw that same recruiter, now without a job because of layoffs with a post about how difficult it is to get a job right now and that the lack of transparency of salary is something that is unfair, as they were disappointed at the long process with an unacceptable salary at the end.  I know they were only doing their job, but they don’t have the right to complain like this after actually being part of the problem.\n\nP.s recruiter seems like a reasonably low skill set job in my opinion.  The people I’ve seen in those roles are nice, but I don’t understand how anyone fails their interviews because they are just asking set questions and have zero tech knowledge.  Obviously searching for people is easy, it’s like reverse job hunting, you find someone currently in the role you are looking for at a different company,  send a copy paste text and set up a call.\n\n### Comment ID jappar4 with +27 score by [(HomChkn, Reddit, 2023-03-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkedInLunatics/comments/11gbf6l/recently_laid_off_recruiters_getting_the_taste_of/jappar4/) (in reply to ID japbdde):\nOne of the hats I wear in HR is recruiting. The biggest skill you need is organization and good communication skills. \n\nAny way if a company doesn't post the salary range they are most likely not worth working for. You have a budget for the position. The jib should have a pay scale. Post the part of the scale the fits the budget. Simple enough.

They're scans, often compound documents (as in documents created at different times added together - a master with appendices and exhibits, or an amendment with schedules, toss in a few Work Orders in between things). As scans, they usually have random handwriting, artifacts, etc. As compound documents, they may have single column then double column, sometimes triple column, then it might switch to landscape orientation for printed spreadsheets tucked into the contract. I've found plenty of OCR that can address each item individually, but nothing that can correctly OCR the entire document. When the doc starts out single column then changes to double or triple column, most OCR ends up giving me single lines across (breaking the columns) which is useless.\nThe next issue is that contracts are stored as PDF, which, for text, means there are returns inserted at the end of each line (and they rarely correspond to the true end of a sentence.) As a result, I have to try to structure regex to look for phrases that may span a line, but I also need to capture the entire clause, which again proves quite difficult with end of line returns inserted throughout. Between the end of line returns and the OCR issues compound the complexity, since it generally means I can't rely on punctuation to be accurate (periods are often OCRd as commas, semicolons as commas, commas as periods, etc.)\n\nIf I have plain text, no OCR issues, and no odd returns throughout, I can handle things beautifully with regex. But the only way I get that is to manually fix the text.\n\n### Comment ID k9xs5r8 with +1 score by [(PLERoss, Reddit, 2023-11-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaltech/comments/17ewo3q/legal_ai_what_have_you_used_reviews/k9xs5r8/) (in reply to ID k9xp061):\nI’ve been looking too!

Hopefully my post doesn't violate the rules.\n\nI'll cut to the chase.  I'm a lawyer in my early 40s.  I have about $1 million invested.  I'm interested in living internationally and working remotely to help cover my living expenses.  I'm not interested in working a 40-hour desk job.  I can tap into my investments, but I really need a source of income to help cover costs and give my investments time to grow.\n\nIt's very difficult to do remote legal work given the rules around unauthorized practice of law.  There are some freelance options, but you'd basically have to sell your services to a law firm as a non-attorney law clerk or paralegal.\n\nI've been looking into programmer boot camps, particularly those offered through major universities.\n\nMy question is: Would it be feasible to learn enough at one of these bootcamps to get freelance work as a newb with a US-based company that I could perform while living aboard?  I'm not talking a six-figure salary, perhaps something in the $20-50K a year range.\n\nIs this a crazy idea?

I have worked with the same independent corporate lawyer for years now and I have no idea at all where he lives and we've not met in person for over 10 years now.  He forms companies for me, deals with stock grants, creates and reviews contracts with vendors ... and he does this for me and a handful of other startups.  Most of my communication with him is done via email and only in rare cases do I even get on a phone with him.\n\nAs it happens, I am also a software developer and have hired my fair share of developers.  What I can offer in that regard is that if you are trying to get into development, go for a niche area that is in demand and go \"deep\" (e.g. React Mobile, Flutter, and Swift) and create a few demo apps using the technology.  Nothing speaks to me more as a hiring manager than proof of skill.  Show me an app that you've made and show me the code you wrote and you will be lightyears ahead of everyone else.  I'd also suggest getting involved with the local \"expert\" groups in the technology wherever you go.  The networking is essential and it will get you in tight with the core tech teams at Google etc.  \n\nI'd also suggest creating a youtube channel and document your learnings in the technology as you go ... its great advertising and an even better proof of skill.\n\nThe reality is that software development is hard work to get into and excel in (much like law I would assume) ... but once you do achieve a level of skill, you won't worry about making a living the rest of your life.\n\n## Comment ID hx237yg with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-02-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/st7j2f/lawyer_to_programmerdigital_nomad_am_i_crazy/hx237yg/) (in reply to ID st7j2f):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID hx24jly with +1 score by [(randobehindakeyboard, Reddit, 2022-02-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/st7j2f/lawyer_to_programmerdigital_nomad_am_i_crazy/hx24jly/) (in reply to ID hx237yg):\nI'm in-house and haven't worked for a firm in over a decade.\n\nIdeally, I'd get a nice expat assignment with a US company, but my industry moved away from those several years ago.  It's not an option with my current company.\n\nMy understanding, and again it's been years since I was in private practice, is that you have to have an association with a local law firm or attorney in order for this to be above board.\n\nI've read ethics opinions from the state where I'm licensed and it's clear that if I give up residence in my state, I'd have to legally be able to practice law in the jurisdiction I reside.  Most countries require that foreign lawyers associate with a local attorney.  Big law has these arrangements and can easily send their attorneys abroad. \n\nI could try to fly under the radar, but I'd be risking disciplinary proceedings (or disbarment) in the state I am licensed in.\n\n#### Comment ID hx2n3l0 with +9 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-02-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/st7j2f/lawyer_to_programmerdigital_nomad_am_i_crazy/hx2n3l0/) (in reply to ID hx24jly):\n[deleted]\n\n## Comment ID hx2jgu6 with +2 score by [(pino_entre_palmeras, Reddit, 2022-02-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/st7j2f/lawyer_to_programmerdigital_nomad_am_i_crazy/hx2jgu6/) (in reply to ID st7j2f):\nDo you have any intrinsic interest in the field(s) itself, or is your interest strictly about how compatible it is with traveling?\n\nYou might be able to land a gig after a bootcamp (in some cases someone who is in their first semester of law school might have enough knowledge to answer a legal question, the bar aside), but the ability to find a gig with the flexibility you’re talking about is probably tough.\n\nI assume as a lawyer that you write English very well, that you have ample soft skills, and have a strong attention to detail.

Contra: Hard Corps Appreciation Post with +199 score by [(Eat1Box, Reddit, 2024-05-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1cqey3y/complete_madness_contra_hard_corps_appreciation/)\nI’m gonna be honest, I discovered this game just this year, but it has already climbed up into my top 20 favorite retro games. I didn’t play Genesis nor Contra games as much as I should have, so my surprise when I picked Hard Corps up can’t be stated in words. IMO, this is a game you have to play as least once to grasp the beauty and awesomeness of Hard Corps.\n\nThe music is batshit insane, the gameplay is intense, and best of all, it’s not a long game to complete. It is still a Contra game, so it’s still hard as balls but as a silver lining, the Japanese version of Hard Corps has health bars that let you take hits before you lose a life. However, the American version is the Salty Splatoon of Hard Corps. One hit and you lose a life. I can see this turning off numerous casual players and I totally understand cause I die multiple times on a level before I progress to the next one. But the grind of playing optimally is what keeps me going. This is a game that will test your mettle but if you can complete it, the gaming world is your oyster!\n\nI have evidence to prove this game was made with cocaine, G-Fuel, Mountain Dew, and gasoline. From the very first level, Hard Corps has no chill. You’re probably going to need all the Starbucks you can get to keep up with the level of insanity that is beating this game.\n\n## Comment ID l3qxo7p with +36 score by [(Nonainonono, Reddit, 2024-05-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1cqey3y/complete_madness_contra_hard_corps_appreciation/l3qxo7p/) (in reply to ID 1cqey3y):\nI always recommend people to play the romhack that reinstate the 3 hits per live on the NTSCU version.\n\nThis is the best contra and probably run and gun game ever made.\n\n### Comment ID l3sfyx3 with +7 score by [(dueljester, Reddit, 2024-05-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1cqey3y/complete_madness_contra_hard_corps_appreciation/l3sfyx3/) (in reply to ID l3qxo7p):\nNuts to that.

Things have become really bad in the past six months. Leadership makes fake promises of improving things, but in the end, it only makes things worse for the people who do the work. A certain leader went on a listening tour and spoke for 23 minutes out of the 25 minutes allotted for listening to an employee. So you can imagine how much the leadership cares about its employees. One manager's modus operandi is to fire people on her team every few months. Good luck if you are on her team. Workload has increased, or in some cases, tripled, and pay has in fact decreased. Another leader claims that a certain task can be completed in 2 hours, whereas in reality it can take an entire week. Of course, that leader has never done any work at the ground level. Work gets dumped on you all the time!!",

          "cons": "It becomes apparent early on that transparency and fairness, which were promised upfront, are nothing but empty words. Despite being quoted a specific compensation upon accepting the position, the actual earnings fell far short, and there was no effort to rectify this discrepancy. The disparity in salaries between employees at different levels, even when their job responsibilities are identical, is a major concern. The company avoids addressing these glaring discrepancies and crucial employee questions, such as the absence of a 401k match, during company-wide meetings. Management's response to salary adjustments has been nothing short of a constant stream of excuses. Despite initial claims that salaries were \"above market\" or competitive, these assertions fail to acknowledge the impact of inflation over time. What might have seemed like a favorable salary upon joining the company loses its advantage as the cost of living increases. In reality, employees are now faced with a disheartening choice, realizing that despite the excuses provided, they are effectively experiencing a salary reduction of over 10% due to the soaring cost of living. On top of the favoritism and broken promises, another disillusioning aspect of working at this company was the current lack of promotion opportunities. During the hiring process, they boasted about a high likelihood of upward mobility within a year, creating a sense of optimism among new employees. However, as time went on, it became evident that these promises were nothing more than empty assurances. The path to advancement has been riddled with obstacles. The lack of career growth opportunities and the feeling of being stuck in the same role for an extended period has added to the growing dissatisfaction with the company's management and their lack of commitment to their own promises. The most significant problem within this company is the rampant favoritism displayed by higher-ups. The issue of favoritism extends to the leadership team, where it is evident that many members of the c-suite surround themselves with friends. Consequently, any problems or concerns are either ignored or inadequately addressed, further contributing to a toxic work environment. Attempts to raise concerns to people partners about favoritism or any other issues proved futile, as they merely took note of the problem without offering any resolution. The lack of accountability and disregard for employee feedback further exacerbated the discontent. One incident that particularly highlighted the lack of accountability within the company was when a leader used a slur during a weekly team meeting. The company took an unreasonably long time to issue an apology, which, when it finally came, felt insincere and failed to hold the leader accountable for their behavior.",

I never feel like I don’t know what direction the company is heading and what our mission is. \n\nAnother pro is the people here. Everyone genuinely cares about each other and helping their teams succeed. We function as a true collaborative team. Not to mention, whenever I need help or am uncertain of something either my manager, leadership, or the people team have been happy to take the time to support.\n\nOntra truly feels like a place I can grow and build a long term career at. \n\nThe last thing I want to mention is how nice it is that senior leadership connects with all levels of employees. Hierarchy is thrown out the window whether you are a very junior employee or the most senior everyone interacts, listens, and respects each other.",

This can create challenges for managers and colleagues who have to compensate for a small minority of individuals who expect to be able to phone it in and coast. This is usually identified quickly and addressed (and is not unique to Ontra), but can create challenges for the large majority of employees who are engaged, high performers. - Like any start-up that has grown rapidly and hired quickly, there are some growing pains and opportunities for organizational improvements. This is pretty normal for a company in this stage of growth - and part of what can be exciting for some people about working in earlier stage / high growth companies. However, it's not for everyone - and can be a tough place for people who don't want to learn about the industry / end customers, have a \"clock-in / clock-out\" mindset or don't do well with change. May not be the right fit for everyone.",

Despite being quoted a specific compensation upon accepting the position, the actual earnings fell far short, and there was no effort to rectify this discrepancy. The disparity in salaries between employees at different levels, even when their job responsibilities are identical, is a major concern. The company avoids addressing these glaring discrepancies and crucial employee questions, such as the absence of a 401k match, during company-wide meetings. Management's response to salary adjustments has been nothing short of a constant stream of excuses. Despite initial claims that salaries were \"above market\" or competitive, these assertions fail to acknowledge the impact of inflation over time. What might have seemed like a favorable salary upon joining the company loses its advantage as the cost of living increases. In reality, employees are now faced with a disheartening choice, realizing that despite the excuses provided, they are effectively experiencing a salary reduction of over 10% due to the soaring cost of living. On top of the favoritism and broken promises, another disillusioning aspect of working at this company was the current lack of promotion opportunities. During the hiring process, they boasted about a high likelihood of upward mobility within a year, creating a sense of optimism among new employees. However, as time went on, it became evident that these promises were nothing more than empty assurances. The path to advancement has been riddled with obstacles. The lack of career growth opportunities and the feeling of being stuck in the same role for an extended period has added to the growing dissatisfaction with the company's management and their lack of commitment to their own promises. The most significant problem within this company is the rampant favoritism displayed by higher-ups. The issue of favoritism extends to the leadership team, where it is evident that many members of the c-suite surround themselves with friends. Consequently, any problems or concerns are either ignored or inadequately addressed, further contributing to a toxic work environment. Attempts to raise concerns to people partners about favoritism or any other issues proved futile, as they merely took note of the problem without offering any resolution. The lack of accountability and disregard for employee feedback further exacerbated the discontent. One incident that particularly highlighted the lack of accountability within the company was when a leader used a slur during a weekly team meeting. The company took an unreasonably long time to issue an apology, which, when it finally came, felt insincere and failed to hold the leader accountable for their behavior.",

We are big enough that you can focus on and develop in your area of expertise, but small enough that anyone can bring ideas to the table and make a difference. We have also embraced being fully remote which means I get to shift what used to be commute time into family time. In order to do this well, the company has put in a lot of support structures to ensure that we have the tools be successful + appropriate opportunities to meet up with and work alongside each other in person.

Contract Automation is also used by dozens of prominent investment banks and offered through partnerships with AM Law 100 firms and service providers. The platform streamlines processes for a variety of M&A and private deal document types, including non-disclosure agreements, non-reliance letters, vendor contracts, and engagement letters, and continues to expand.\n\nDesigned to help private capital markets firms accelerate the negotiation of key contracts and dealmaking, Ontra's Contract Automation offers an end-to-end platform solution that is powered by industry-leading AI. It is an integral part of Ontra's Legal Operating System, purpose-built to automate legal workflows for the private investment industry.\n\nOntra first integrated AI capabilities into Contract Automation in 2016. Adding OpenAI's GPT-4 will allow Ontra to leverage its deep private markets expertise to accelerate expansion into more document types, and power several new and upcoming features to increase the speed of contract negotiations, including:\n\nDigital Playbooks: The digital source of truth for negotiation preferences to ensure seamless collaboration across legal and business teams with data-driven insights into positions' market alignment.\n\nMarkup Builder: AI-enabled markup tool that surfaces precedent, automates redlines, offers side-by-side document comparisons, and generates suggestions at the clause level that are aligned with a customer's digital playbook, substantially reducing editing time.\n\nAutomated Summaries: Fully automated, AI-generated summaries of key legal and business terms that can also accommodate additional customer-specific requests.\n\n\"Reaching our millionth document is an exciting milestone, and one that reflects the deep private markets legal experience embedded across our Legal Operating System,\" said Troy Pospisil, Ontra's CEO and founder. \"We've saved our customers countless hours to date, and on the heels of this achievement, we are excited to integrate additional AI capabilities that further Ontra's mission to accelerate routine contract negotiations, reduce friction in the dealmaking process, and expand to additional document types to save our customers even more time.\"\n\n\"One million contracts processed marks a historic moment for Ontra, and it's just the beginning,\" said Frank Giovinazzo, Ontra's GM of Contract Automation. \"Now, after a decade of handling routine contracts, integrating GPT-4's advanced capabilities means we can reach the next million exponentially faster and usher in a new era of contract management and collaboration.\"\n\nFor private investment firms, managing routine contract negotiations in-house stretches the limits of even the most talented and sophisticated legal teams, diverting attention from sourcing deals, managing investments, and operating the business. Contract Automation solves this challenge by combining an innovative and collaborative AI-powered software platform with a global network of highly trained legal professionals so teams can focus on strategic work.\n\n\"The ability to move efficiently is key to being competitive in private markets, and NDAs are a critical component of the investing process,\" said Jon Korngold, Global Head of Blackstone Growth. \"Ontra's AI-powered solution has helped us reduce significant friction in our processes — this has given our deal teams leverage so we can focus on conducting diligence, building deeper relationships with founders, and being a trusted partner during the next chapter of their growth journeys.\"\n\nFor more information about how Ontra transforms routine contracting for the private capital markets, visit www.ontra.ai.\n\nAbout Ontra\n\nOntra is the global leader in contract automation and intelligence for private capital markets firms.

      "# [Ontra’s Insight, Powered By GPT by Ethan Beberness, Jennifer Petersen, Chris Williams, Jordan Rothman, Joe Patrice, Steven Chung, Source: THOMSON, Source: Above The Law, Source: Associate Center on 2024-01-25](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/ontras-insight-powered-by-gpt-4-simplifies-fund-management/)\nSince the initial release of OpenAI’s GPT large language model in 2022, developments in generative AI have transformed how the professional services industry conducts business, presenting new avenues for increasing efficiency and shifting workflows.\n\nOntra, the leader in AI-powered private markets contract automation and intelligence, has long leveraged machine learning and AI for its products, including its cutting-edge Insight product. Now, however, the company has added GPT-4 capabilities to the AI that powers Insight, taking Insight’s ability to help private markets professionals manage fund and side letter obligations and compliance to the next level.\n\nAbove the Law recently spoke with Ontra’s SVP of Engineering, Eric Hawkins to learn more about how integrating GPT-4 into the Insight product bolsters the already powerful tool.\n\nTransforming Contract Management in Private Markets With GPT-4\n\nTraditionally, private markets firms managed key documents on paper, in PDF form, and in antiquated filing systems. With Insight and its addition of GPT-4, however, private markets professionals can access a digital repository of their key fund documents and no longer need to search through those PDF documents individually to surface core terms and information, according to Hawkins.\n\n“Insight takes complex fund data and structures it in a way that makes it easy to find the answers to your questions, to compare provisions, to understand what you’ve agreed to, and what you have to comply with,” Hawkins explains.\n\n“It empowers multiple teams to work and collaborate more efficiently and bolster firm compliance in the face of increasing regulatory scrutiny.”\n\nPrivate markets professionals can search this structured repository of data, which includes limited partnership agreements, side letters, and other fund documents relevant to GPs’ obligations to investors, using the product’s SmartSearch feature. This feature empowers private markets professionals to quickly find and compare examples of past versions of a particular provision or agreement. Having that precedent on hand enables firms to negotiate better outcomes.\n\nDelivering Better, Faster Workflows\n\nInsight benefits private markets professionals by sorting and clustering the vast amount of data necessary for managing private funds. This allows not only for a single source of truth, but also for the development of better, more efficient workflows.\n\n“Insight consolidates all of that information across your fund docs and then lets you, as a private equity or legal professional helping private funds, have a more consolidated view of your obligations and commitments and build efficient workflows that keep you compliant,” Hawkins explains. “It lets you be efficient relative to the things you have to do for your LPs in particular.”\n\nThose better workflows can be built across multiple teams and can take into account variation between different versions of an agreement for different investors, Hawkins emphasizes.\n\nHe notes the ability to quickly pull up documents related to specific arrangements also allows private markets teams to stay agile during event-based occurrences that may trigger springing obligations. Additionally, he explains teams can integrate Insight into workflows relevant to every part of private fund management, from fundraising and MFN elections to ongoing investor and fund reporting and obligation management.\n\nHawkins also adds that teams can export data and reports from Insight, a feature he notes can be particularly helpful when asset managers prepare for mock and regular audits.\n\nAn AI Tool With A Human Touch\n\nUnlike many technology companies that utilize only AI for their main products, Ontra draws on the skills of a dedicated network of legal and private markets professionals — called “human-in-the-loop” experts — as an extra set of eyes to review the accuracy and relevancy of AI outputs.\n\nPrivate markets firms often begin by uploading fund documents via Insight to categorize and summarize the obligations contained therein. When this happens, as Hawkins explains, a specialist reviews and approves the obligations listed by Insight’s output, overriding, editing, or approving the suggestions as needed.\n\n“We basically take all of this structured data from Insight and put it in front of one of our trusted humans-in-the-loop, and they can very quickly review this and reduce the time it takes to digitize agreements,” adds Hawkins.\n\n“They can go through the whole document and can see the AI recommendations, then they can say ‘Yep, this looks right,’ or ‘This wasn’t quite right, let me touch it up a bit.’” he says. “Anybody can feed a document to ChatGPT, but storing and managing that data in a way that is useful to your firm is the magic that happens here.”\n\nHigh Speed, High Security\n\nWhen adopting any type of AI-based tool into day-to-day operations, security should be top of mind for any private markets firm.\n\nThe integration of GPT-4 into Insight was conducted with a focus on security.\n\n“None of the data we use to prompt OpenAI models will ever be used [by OpenAI] in subsequent training runs,” Hawkins states. “As a customer of OpenAI, Ontra was able to implement zero data retention for our customers, which means the basic data uploaded when a customer prompts GPT is immediately forgotten by OpenAI.”\n\nIn addition to the agreement between Ontra and OpenAI, Insight also adheres to the SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria for Security, a security framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to minimize the risk of data breaches.",
