From there I ask it theoretical claim questions like, “I had X happen to me and attempted to clarify it with merchant—no resolve was offered from X and I’m requesting a full refund.”  The AI program would respond with likelihoods for claim denials, citing articles within the T&C, or not (alluding to increased likelihood of claim approval).               Does something like this exist?                                          I just had a lackluster chargeback experience with Visa where they so easily could have warned me, as I made the claim, that it would very likely get denied and here’s why ______.  But no.                                          So that means it’s up to me (us)♥️\n\n## Comment ID kyw33m3 with +1 score by [(Realistic_Wolf_6446, Reddit, 2024-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaltech/comments/17ewo3q/legal_ai_what_have_you_used_reviews/kyw33m3/) (in reply to ID 17ewo3q):\nI'm using Pincites and the functionality is great, and they help you build out whatever playbooks you need to get started immediately.

Pre/Dicta looks at every ump that looks just like yours, across the entire history of baseball, with every player that resembles every player on your team and the opponent, and every manager and coach that resembles every manager and coach in your game, and every weather forecast that was the same as your weather, and so on and so on... basically, it looks at trillions of data combinations, and will tell you how that Umpire is going to call the game... with 85% accuracy.  \n\nThe difference between conventional filter based analytics and Pre/Dicta is the difference between an Almanac and NASA AI/Machine Learning Climate forecasting.

They're scans, often compound documents (as in documents created at different times added together - a master with appendices and exhibits, or an amendment with schedules, toss in a few Work Orders in between things). As scans, they usually have random handwriting, artifacts, etc. As compound documents, they may have single column then double column, sometimes triple column, then it might switch to landscape orientation for printed spreadsheets tucked into the contract. I've found plenty of OCR that can address each item individually, but nothing that can correctly OCR the entire document. When the doc starts out single column then changes to double or triple column, most OCR ends up giving me single lines across (breaking the columns) which is useless.\nThe next issue is that contracts are stored as PDF, which, for text, means there are returns inserted at the end of each line (and they rarely correspond to the true end of a sentence.) As a result, I have to try to structure regex to look for phrases that may span a line, but I also need to capture the entire clause, which again proves quite difficult with end of line returns inserted throughout. Between the end of line returns and the OCR issues compound the complexity, since it generally means I can't rely on punctuation to be accurate (periods are often OCRd as commas, semicolons as commas, commas as periods, etc.)\n\nIf I have plain text, no OCR issues, and no odd returns throughout, I can handle things beautifully with regex. But the only way I get that is to manually fix the text.\n\n### Comment ID k9xs5r8 with +1 score by [(PLERoss, Reddit, 2023-11-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaltech/comments/17ewo3q/legal_ai_what_have_you_used_reviews/k9xs5r8/) (in reply to ID k9xp061):\nI’ve been looking too!

And to your point about AI research, I work with a company that is heavily invested in AI and with the recent surge in LLMs such as GPT and Claude being so dominant as a general use and cheap alternative to modeling your own bespoke LM, Ruby is very well positioned to be a more dominant player in this area.

Unlike many of commenters here I have had great success and have found that being a seasoned Rails dev to be in high demand. That said, I am seeing a trend currently where frontend React devs are highly in demand.\n\nI was on the React train in the early days (2016'ish) and really thought that is was the future of frontend development. This really seems to be where the world has moved recently and React developers are generally in high demand, so it is generally a good skill to have on your resume.\n\nBUT, from what I have learned in my 12 years of being a primarily Rails dev is that DHH is pretty much always 2-3 years ahead of the industry and is almost always right. A lot of people will argue that Rails is \"dead\" but I whole heartedly disagree. I really think what they are doing with modern Javascript is where the future is, and Rails is embracing it and forging the path ahead.\n\nWhen the \"hot new thing\" in React was server side rendering (https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components), it really made me chuckle a bit. This has been the default for Rails since the beginning. Internet speed, browser capabilities, and the maturity of JavaScript has generally made these complicated front end frameworks mostly worthless IMO.\n\nAll that said, I would say learning Rails is a worthwhile endeavor. It's here to stay, and if you are proficient with Laravel it won't be a huge leap to learn Ruby/Rails, and it might even be a delight! It's definitely worth at least a few hours of your time to see if it jives with you. There are lots of opportunities out there.\n\n## Comment ID ltvrlez with +1 score by [(DisneyLegalTeam, Reddit, 2024-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/1gc9jh3/id_like_to_learn_rails_but/ltvrlez/) (in reply to ID 1gc9jh3):\nAre there a lot of remote Laravel jobs?

I don't find the work interesting and the hours are too gruelling. I'm 35F, single, no kids, and frankly not sure any of that is on the cards while I'm still in this job (last long term relationship ended 3 years ago).\n\nAny suggestions welcome on how to manage this transition as undoubtedly starting from scratch in a different field will involve a salary cut. Any ideas about what field I could look into joining also welcome.\n\nFinancially, I have 125k in ISA and 150k in DC pension. Current salary 140k, 25% bonus expected in June. I do not own property/am currently renting.\n\nLackluster financials are because I spent my twenties working minimum wage retail and studying open uni part time. When I was in sixth form my mum (single mum) was diagnosed with cancer and had trouble looking after my severely disabled sister, so I had to look after them both. Both passed in my twenties and I didn't graduate uni until 30 or start my current job until I was 31.\n\nPart of me is really dispirited about going from LE to HENRY and now potentially going back the other way, but I'm just so tired and unsure about what to do with my life.\n\n## Comment ID kvbtf3v with +120 score by [(motivatedfatty, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvbtf3v/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nI’ll give you the advice I give to people who come to see me about being burn out - My take on this is not to make big life decisions whilst totally burnt out. \n\nCan you safely make it to June to get the bonus? Do you have annual leave you can take? \n\nGet signed off for one month from your GP for burn out. Take some breathing space. You’ve worked very hard to get to where you are but your mental health is worth more than your income. Let yourself recover and have some space before deciding what to do next. I do acknowledge a month off for burn out in these firms would be very detrimental if you then decided you wanted to stay but resigning would also have the same impact. \n\nDo you like law? Can you imagine liking law? My husband is PQE6 with a great life balance working in house. Lower pay, and there are issues, but 4 day working week, weekends are his, no burn out. When in big firm he was overall more miserable with less life work balance. It might not be that law is the problem and that it’s the firm. You’ll drop salary but still have a good income for a nice life, particularly if you leave London.\n\n### Comment ID kvc5vf5 with +27 score by [(billbabybill, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvc5vf5/) (in reply to ID kvbtf3v):\nI am not convinced that being a lawyer in a corporate environment is for me, I find it really hard to \"care\" about big companies and their commercial interests.

From my perspective, very few people there actually care about the company and none of them are managers. The managers just try to convince to do things for “a greater good” so you put in free overtime and make them look good for their next promotion.\n\nIf you really do care about law, then go in house as others suggest, do the bits that you like on your contracted hours, and go home at 5 and switch off your phone / laptop.\n\nI made a career in a technical specialist field with a STEM background and caring about my employer (a big uk bank) and believing the corporate propaganda caused my burn out. Now I’m a consultant (because I like the work I did / do), earn more, stick to my contracted work time and am overall much happier. \n\nYes, I still suffer from post burn out, but I manage it a lot better and get back on track faster - by simply prioritising my needs over my employer’s or client’s needs. I guess your field is niche enough that skills and experience are hard to come by, so usually people involved can’t complain too hard as they don’t want to alienate you. \n\nAlso, once you set boundaries (especially at the beginning) and stick to them, people are forced to work around and accept it. I had been gaslighted in the past that I needed to prove myself every single day, but after some time realised that people earning more than me did less and sometimes even displayed their slacker attitude, but had no risk of getting fired. You’d be surprised how much of your experience was a result of you trying to be too pleasing to everyone. \n\nOne very last point of advice - go for some form of therapy. I for example tried CBT and al the insights I shared above my therapist brought out to me and really helped to start my mindset changed which (together with the job change and boundary setting) saved my sanity and my high earning job - as a matter of fact, I wasn’t HENRY when I was burnt out, but now am - with less stress. I relate as I come from a working family (did OU as well :) ) and it’s not worth sacrificing many years of high earning potential without trying different solutions first.\n\n#### Comment ID kvc9ht2 with +10 score by [(Kittykittycatcat1000, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvc9ht2/) (in reply to ID kvc5vf5):\nWhat about the civil service?

You are in a mugs game. The hours, stress, nature of the work and utter uselessness of what you do will grind you down. However, you can leave! And you are in an awesome position, you've done a great slog, got the CV stuff and you will walk your next gig. I moved in house and did the industry rounds. If you still want to work the  corporate ladder and want to do variety of work this is the route for you. If you want to FIRE its locum work. This career choice gets a little taking used to as it's so unlike what the people that have trained you would do. But you take complete rein of your own life and get to quit and spend 6 months travelling wherever you want. Also you can work remotely, which means from any destination. If you care about freedom, have no major financial commitments and can live with the ego hit from peers, this one is for you. This is my current choice. \nOther alternatives could be taking a corporate role in the Arab world. Low tax more sun. \nNGO work is surprisingly stressful and you are up against people with higher PQE that don't care about the pay. The interesting work is at a very high PQE level and you will deskilling if you move now. It's a world of privilege in many ways (in my experience, 6 month at International NGO).\nI would advise stay in law and make a few different moves. Only then think about leaving.

E.g., instead of earning £140k in PE corporate law at an MC firm, working in-house somewhere for £80-90k.\n\nIt also comes down to you as a person. Would you be happy with a lower earning life, especially seeing your current peers go on to become partners etc.?

I know the feeling. Mine got so bad I would walk to work and think of I got hit by a car or a bus at least I'd be in hospital and couldn't be contacted for a few days / weeks. It felt like there was no escape. \n\nLeaving that company was the best thing that I ever did. I took a job with less responsibility within the same industry and within a month I was no longer burnt out and I missed the responsibility I had. Within 6 months I was yearning for more and felt uninspired. \n\nMy point is, like many others have said, burnout needs tending to. If you can take time off, leave your job or be signed off, then you may find you love your job but it's the relentlessness of it that's having an impact. \n\nLeaving that job was the best thing I ever did. It was so toxic, the hours were insane and the management ground everyone to the floor. When I was in that place (partly due to the management and general nature of the business), it felt like there was no where to go. We were told our competitors were terrible and I felt like I couldn't do the type of work we did anywhere else. \n\nThat was a lie, and I'm better paid, happier and doing better work than I've ever done. If you feel like the company could be the issue - leave, join somewhere which is less intense and you can spend a year or two figuring out what you'd like to do less stressed and with more time to consider. I spent just under 2 years at a new company after I burnt out, and then I took a promotion, a 20% salary increase and now I'm back on my feet and absolutely loving work. \n\nBurnout is no joke. Take it seriously and if you're aware of it and posting about it on Reddit, you need to quit your job and give yourself time to recuperate. You'll be surprised how quickly you return to normal once you're out of the situation!\n\n## Comment ID kvbvm2c with +3 score by [(Menryn1924, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvbvm2c/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nI wasn't a million miles away from your situation, but I didn't walk away from law - just that job.\n\nIf you get a job in-house or at another firm (with a better balance) you can be conservative with the date you can start, and push your firm to either put you on gardening leave or let you leave after less than your full notice period.

Got to 4yrs PQE at MC firm in Corproate law, burnt out and hated it. Quit and after a few months off pivoted and went into teaching. Loved it but after 2-3yrs (and having my first kid) realised the problem was not the law - it was corporate law. \n\nI'm now 4 years into private client practice. During my LPC, wills/probate etc was only given a cursory look in - and naive me at the time thought \"God that sounds so boring\". But turns out I LOVE it. My corporate deals never excited me, could never find it in myself to be excited about my deals on the front page of the FT. Now my job is PEOPLE, and it is personal to them, and I feel like I can help at what can be really difficult times of their lives. It's also highly technical so intellectually stimulating.\n\nIt has its moments, but mostly the job is 9 - 5.30, and I go home and have time with my family (which never would have happened if I hadn't left the city).

The hours are a lot more 9-5, except for when deals are going through but it’s nothing compared to private practice. You will undoubtedly have to take a pay cut but in house 2 PQE legal counsel can expect £110-150k base, with a bonus and generous carried interest/ shares schemes. It’s also arguably a lot more interesting - you are involved in the commercial side of transactions with exposure to the deals teams, not just churning out documents.

Lack of trust also an issue as fact checking/truth finding might be impossible. \n\nMass surveillance on a level we have never seen. Control will follow. Everyday freedoms might disappear. \n\nA truly powerful AGI would run circles around us. Like the difference between us and our pets. Plus, even if we can control it, we can’t agree on values for alignment. Secular ppl might not want to live in a manor prescribed by a very conservative religion based AI set of values (just to illustrate). Californian values don’t work for everyone. \n\nJust a few things that worry me.\n\n### Comment ID kr9yt72 with +4 score by [(danyyyel, Reddit, 2024-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1avcovg/i_dont_understand_ai_hatred_because_of_jobs_taken/kr9yt72/) (in reply to ID kr9qyya):\nVery well said, ask 90% of people if they want to keep the job they don't like, which enables them to have their own house, raise their children, get a car, go to restaurant, Movies and vacation occasionally.

The problem is the transition phase, which we are starting. Now, we will probably see many lay offs and downsizing because of that reduction of human intervention, which means lifes affected. On the long run, however, it will hopefullu be positive and allow us to spend our time on what we decide instead of burning our lifes working. And, about money and so on, there are multiple options, and governmets should start working on making this transition phase smooth for societies (of course they won't do it until they can get some political benefit from it, which will be too late). For example, it might be needed that robots or AI paus taxes, if they are doing the job instead of humans.

Yet, the options to manage these conditions are rapidly diminishing.\n\nPreviously, intermittent FMLA leave provided a lifeline pre covid 19, allowing individuals to manage their health or care for family members and complete job tasks. \n\nPost-COVID, however, the process has become increasingly restrictive. Benefits after 90 day furlow changed as you reapply for benefits, and for those changing employers in same industry or reapplying with an existing employer, a 12-month waiting period for FLMA is now standard for qualified leave. This leaves individuals without vital protections for an extended period, forcing them to endure worsening conditions such as new hvac technology that can cause serious discomfort for adults and children with COPS, lupus, and exasperated asthma.\n\nAdding to the challenge, most employers forcing workers back into the office continue to place workers in compromised environments—wet or dry commercial spaces, unbalanced air chemistry, High RH, AT—without accountability. \n\nThe government provides no oversight or mandates for thorough environmental assessments using proper people and measuring tools or environmental assessments by 3 rd parties without a relationship with stakeholders. \n\nInstead, investigators inspections often rely on visual evaluations, which fail to detect the microscopic organisms and complex indoor atmospheric chemistry that pose significant risks to individuals with respiratory conditions.\n\nThe absence of enforceable air and surface quality standards means that one in five households could face income loss and unnecessary exposure to environmental hazards. As this issue continues to expand nationally and globally, it’s critical for policymakers to implement real solutions that prioritize public health, ensure accountability, and protect those living with respiratory and environmental challenges.

While this background brought deep industry knowledge, it also introduced significant challenges in building a technology-first company.\n\nTo their credit, the company recognized some of these gaps and underwent a restructuring, bringing in experienced professionals with robust backgrounds in tech and SaaS. However, the impact of this positive change is stifled by the company’s structure. Despite hiring these capable individuals, the original leadership—composed of former lawyers—remains in ultimate control.\n\nAs a result, even though the newly hired experts often propose innovative ideas, valuable feedback, and strategic improvements, their suggestions are frequently sidelined or dismissed. This creates a frustrating environment for those who came on board expecting to make a difference, only to find their expertise undervalued.\n\nOntra has potential, but its insistence on maintaining a leadership model rooted in its origins rather than evolving to meet the demands of a modern SaaS organization limits its ability to fully leverage the talent it has brought in. For prospective employees, this may be something to carefully consider before joining.\n\nBe prepared to be reprimanded and abused by the former lawyers in leadership. Forget promotions or leadership positions, unless your degree was in law.",

Things have become really bad in the past six months. Leadership makes fake promises of improving things, but in the end, it only makes things worse for the people who do the work. A certain leader went on a listening tour and spoke for 23 minutes out of the 25 minutes allotted for listening to an employee. So you can imagine how much the leadership cares about its employees. One manager's modus operandi is to fire people on her team every few months. Good luck if you are on her team. Workload has increased, or in some cases, tripled, and pay has in fact decreased. Another leader claims that a certain task can be completed in 2 hours, whereas in reality it can take an entire week. Of course, that leader has never done any work at the ground level. Work gets dumped on you all the time!!",

Something very important to me in a work place is openness and transparency which is hard to come by these days, so I was happy to learn that those are also important values to everyone at Ontra especially leadership. I never feel like I don’t know what direction the company is heading and what our mission is. \n\nAnother pro is the people here. Everyone genuinely cares about each other and helping their teams succeed. We function as a true collaborative team. Not to mention, whenever I need help or am uncertain of something either my manager, leadership, or the people team have been happy to take the time to support.\n\nOntra truly feels like a place I can grow and build a long term career at. \n\nThe last thing I want to mention is how nice it is that senior leadership connects with all levels of employees. Hierarchy is thrown out the window whether you are a very junior employee or the most senior everyone interacts, listens, and respects each other.",

          "cons": "It becomes apparent early on that transparency and fairness, which were promised upfront, are nothing but empty words. Despite being quoted a specific compensation upon accepting the position, the actual earnings fell far short, and there was no effort to rectify this discrepancy. The disparity in salaries between employees at different levels, even when their job responsibilities are identical, is a major concern. The company avoids addressing these glaring discrepancies and crucial employee questions, such as the absence of a 401k match, during company-wide meetings. Management's response to salary adjustments has been nothing short of a constant stream of excuses. Despite initial claims that salaries were \"above market\" or competitive, these assertions fail to acknowledge the impact of inflation over time. What might have seemed like a favorable salary upon joining the company loses its advantage as the cost of living increases. In reality, employees are now faced with a disheartening choice, realizing that despite the excuses provided, they are effectively experiencing a salary reduction of over 10% due to the soaring cost of living. On top of the favoritism and broken promises, another disillusioning aspect of working at this company was the current lack of promotion opportunities. During the hiring process, they boasted about a high likelihood of upward mobility within a year, creating a sense of optimism among new employees. However, as time went on, it became evident that these promises were nothing more than empty assurances. The path to advancement has been riddled with obstacles. The lack of career growth opportunities and the feeling of being stuck in the same role for an extended period has added to the growing dissatisfaction with the company's management and their lack of commitment to their own promises. The most significant problem within this company is the rampant favoritism displayed by higher-ups. The issue of favoritism extends to the leadership team, where it is evident that many members of the c-suite surround themselves with friends. Consequently, any problems or concerns are either ignored or inadequately addressed, further contributing to a toxic work environment. Attempts to raise concerns to people partners about favoritism or any other issues proved futile, as they merely took note of the problem without offering any resolution. The lack of accountability and disregard for employee feedback further exacerbated the discontent. One incident that particularly highlighted the lack of accountability within the company was when a leader used a slur during a weekly team meeting. The company took an unreasonably long time to issue an apology, which, when it finally came, felt insincere and failed to hold the leader accountable for their behavior.",

The leadership has been particularly impressive in this difficult macroeconomic season. While many other startups have had to resort to layoffs, Ontra leadership has been able to continue to drive growth and maintain planned cash burn while not laying off a single person.

Not to mention, whenever I need help or am uncertain of something either my manager, leadership, or the people team have been happy to take the time to support.\n\nOntra truly feels like a place I can grow and build a long term career at. \n\nThe last thing I want to mention is how nice it is that senior leadership connects with all levels of employees. Hierarchy is thrown out the window whether you are a very junior employee or the most senior everyone interacts, listens, and respects each other.",

        "cons": "It becomes apparent early on that transparency and fairness, which were promised upfront, are nothing but empty words. Despite being quoted a specific compensation upon accepting the position, the actual earnings fell far short, and there was no effort to rectify this discrepancy. The disparity in salaries between employees at different levels, even when their job responsibilities are identical, is a major concern. The company avoids addressing these glaring discrepancies and crucial employee questions, such as the absence of a 401k match, during company-wide meetings. Management's response to salary adjustments has been nothing short of a constant stream of excuses. Despite initial claims that salaries were \"above market\" or competitive, these assertions fail to acknowledge the impact of inflation over time. What might have seemed like a favorable salary upon joining the company loses its advantage as the cost of living increases. In reality, employees are now faced with a disheartening choice, realizing that despite the excuses provided, they are effectively experiencing a salary reduction of over 10% due to the soaring cost of living. On top of the favoritism and broken promises, another disillusioning aspect of working at this company was the current lack of promotion opportunities. During the hiring process, they boasted about a high likelihood of upward mobility within a year, creating a sense of optimism among new employees. However, as time went on, it became evident that these promises were nothing more than empty assurances. The path to advancement has been riddled with obstacles. The lack of career growth opportunities and the feeling of being stuck in the same role for an extended period has added to the growing dissatisfaction with the company's management and their lack of commitment to their own promises. The most significant problem within this company is the rampant favoritism displayed by higher-ups. The issue of favoritism extends to the leadership team, where it is evident that many members of the c-suite surround themselves with friends. Consequently, any problems or concerns are either ignored or inadequately addressed, further contributing to a toxic work environment. Attempts to raise concerns to people partners about favoritism or any other issues proved futile, as they merely took note of the problem without offering any resolution. The lack of accountability and disregard for employee feedback further exacerbated the discontent. One incident that particularly highlighted the lack of accountability within the company was when a leader used a slur during a weekly team meeting. The company took an unreasonably long time to issue an apology, which, when it finally came, felt insincere and failed to hold the leader accountable for their behavior.",

However, the impact of this positive change is stifled by the company’s structure. Despite hiring these capable individuals, the original leadership—composed of former lawyers—remains in ultimate control.\n\nAs a result, even though the newly hired experts often propose innovative ideas, valuable feedback, and strategic improvements, their suggestions are frequently sidelined or dismissed. This creates a frustrating environment for those who came on board expecting to make a difference, only to find their expertise undervalued.\n\nOntra has potential, but its insistence on maintaining a leadership model rooted in its origins rather than evolving to meet the demands of a modern SaaS organization limits its ability to fully leverage the talent it has brought in. For prospective employees, this may be something to carefully consider before joining.\n\nBe prepared to be reprimanded and abused by the former lawyers in leadership. Forget promotions or leadership positions, unless your degree was in law.",

This makes it feel like the company is in a constant state of turmoil, which leads to an environment which lacks any sense of job security, cohesion, or trust.

      "# [Celebrating 10 years of Ontra’s growth and success by Ontra on 2024-10-02](https://www.ontra.ai/blog/celebrating-10-years-of-ontra-growth-and-success/)\nOntra celebrates its 10th anniversary this October! What started out as three friends with a clever idea has grown into an industry-leading AI legal tech platform with 800+ customers, over 1.2 million documents processed, and 300+ employees.\n\nWe couldn’t be prouder of Ontra’s journey and the strides we’ve made in helping investment, legal, and compliance professionals streamline and automate repetitive tasks. Now they can spend their time on what matters most — whether that’s important work or getting home in time for dinner.\n\nOntra’s origins\n\nCEO and founder Troy Pospisil formed the idea for Ontra — previously InCloudCounsel — while working in private equity investing. He loved the industry but saw the inefficiencies. The high volume of repetitive, mundane work. The generic legacy tech. The unnecessary late nights.\n\nTroy knew that modern legal tech could be the solution. He partnered with his friend and Kirkland & Ellis lawyer, Ben Levi, to pursue combining a unique labor model with best-in-class technology with the intention of creating an end-to-end contract negotiation solution.\n\nAlong with their third, tech-focused co-founder, Lane Lillquist, the trio set out to build their first solution, Contract Automation — initially known as Document Processing.\n\nTheir vision was clear: Create a world where professionals have more time to focus on what is important to them. Customers would be free from time-consuming, manual tasks and able to better focus on high-value work, while lawyers could build practices free from traditional employment and geographic constraints.\n\nWhen it came time to sell their unique solution to customers, Troy slept on friends’ couches, stamped hundreds of envelopes, and walked miles across NYC to book meetings. It was a labor of love, sweat, and tears that paid off when Ontra celebrated processing 1,000,000 documents a decade later.\n\nGrowth of Ontra’s private markets technology platform\n\nOntra’s ever-expanding private markets technology platform addresses the full spectrum of legal workflows required to fundraise, invest, and operate funds. Through a combination of purpose-built applications, a proprietary AI engine leveraging leading LLMs, and a global Legal Network, Ontra provides more than 800 customers with innovative solutions backed by years of industry expertise.\n\nContract Automation\n\nCustomers leverage Ontra’s AI-powered platform and a global network of independent law firms to automate and streamline processes related to contract intake, negotiation, and execution.\n\nContract Automation has evolved significantly since the early days of Document Processing. We continue to expand contract types, from NDAs to vendor agreements and LP transfers. Our customers’ lawyers now use digital playbooks, our proprietary AI redlining tool, Markup Builder, and a centralized solution with automated notifications to speed up negotiations. Our AI and GPT-4 integration continue to boost AI-powered features, from markup suggestions to quickly summarizing executed agreements.\n\nOver 700 firms trust Contract Automation, including Blackstone, Apollo, KKR, Carlyle, and Fir Tree Partners. Learn more about how Blackstone closes high-caliber investments faster, and Fir Tree cut negotiation times in half with Ontra.\n\nInsight\n\nThroughout the first six years, Ontra grew to over 50 employees and 300 customers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The business developed close relationships with private fund managers and asset managers and, through these close ties, Ontra discovered growing pain points around side letter management and compliance. Firms had too many side letters and obligations to effectively track in a spreadsheet. The team at Ontraset out to build another solution.\n\nWith Insight, customers leverage AI to digitize their LPAs and side letters and create a central repository. They now have a searchable, digital compendia containing all of their categorized obligations and where they can assign tasks and pull reports to support their compliance efforts. We are continually adding to Insight’s features, such as the recent additions of digital MFN elections and AI Search.\n\nLeading managers worldwide, including Blackstone, Battery Ventures, AllianceBernstein, Silverlake, L Catterton, and Pharos Capital Group, rely on Insight. Learn how Pharos accelerated their SEC exam response with Insight’s search and reporting capabilities.\n\nAtlas\n\nOntra’s most recently launched product modernizes legal entity management to automate Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) filings and other compliance workflows. Once again, Ontra’s growing team focused on a solution that would specifically address our customers’ legal and compliance needs.\n\nOne Equity Partners, Glendower Capital, Ridgemont Equity Partners, and more rely on Atlas to manage their entity information in a single AI-enabled platform, generate customizable structure charts, and automate CTA filings.\n\nSynapse\n\nOntra’s AI engine, Synapse, is a cutting-edge combination of proprietary models and third-party LLMs, including OpenAI’s GPT-4.\n\nSynapse:\n\nIs safe and secure: Customer data is carefully guarded and not used to train third-party models.\n\nIs designed for private markets: Purpose-built for private market contracts and workflows.\n\nGenerates customer-specific results: Data is fetched in real time for quick and relevant results.\n\nRelies on a human-in-the-loop model: Dedicated professionals review AI-generated results.\n\nOur industry-leading AI provides solutions to solve our customers’ unique and complex problems.

      "# [Leading the charge: Law firms’ role in advancing AI in private equity by Ontra on 2024-06-13](https://www.ontra.ai/blog/law-firms-role-in-advancing-ai-in-private-equity/)\nAs outside counsel to private fund advisers, law firms are pivotal in driving the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) within the private equity (PE) industry. However, they face a unique dual challenge of incorporating AI into their own operations while also guiding PE clients through the implementation process.\n\nWhile AI adoption in the legal industry is still in its early stages, big law firms are already making significant strides by focusing on efficiency, cost reduction, and generating greater value for clients. By using AI to automate and streamline the most manual and routine parts of the law firm’s workload, lawyers are reclaiming valuable time for more strategic work.\n\nLaw firms are also a driving force in helping private fund advisers implement AI tools safely and confidently by understanding the technology’s benefits, risks, and regulatory landscapes for their clients.\n\nThis article explores how law firms can align their AI knowledge and adoption with their PE clients’ needs.\n\nThe AI adoption curve is ramping up at law firms\n\nIn Thomson Reuters’ 2023 Future of Professionals Report, 70% of the legal professionals surveyed said AI would have a transformative or high impact on the profession — more than the economy, regulations, or environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues.\n\nWhile many surveys and statistics show how law firms and in-house legal teams use AI, it’s impossible to settle on a realistic figure for their adoption rate. In all likelihood, adoption is currently similar to the customary tech adoption curve.\n\nThat’s not to say AI adoption will always follow a traditional bell curve. In 2023 and early 2024, many law firms were cognizant of the risks but willing to explore new AI vendors and tools. Experts believe that adoption will move swiftly as generative AI (GenAI) capabilities advance dramatically in weeks and months instead of years.\n\nIn another Thomson Reuters report, ChatGPT and Generative AI within Law Firms, Jason Adaska, Director of the Innovation Lab at U.S. law firm Holland & Hart, said: “The biggest delta I’ve seen is just people understanding that the realm of the possible has sort of shifted in a monumental way.” He added that this means GenAI education has become critical. “This is actually the most important thing for us, strategically the most important thing for the firm and our department, is to put resources out there.”\n\nIn another indication of AI’s growing importance, some BigLaw firms are now training summer associates on GenAI. Bloomberg Law reported that K&L Gates, Dechert, and Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe have all incorporated AI training into the 2024 summer associates class, which includes teaching them how to use AI research and chatbot tools.\n\n“That’s the whole idea about the training program: You need to teach people how this is going to impact the way they come to work,” Brendan McDonnell, a K&L Gates partner and member of the firm’s AI solutions group, told Bloomberg.\n\nWhy PE firms expect law firms to be trusted AI advisers\n\nAI’s transformative potential means a law firm’s AI strategy should align its services with its clients’ needs and strategies. For several reasons, private equity firms are looking for law firms to be strategic partners in adopting generative AI.\n\n1. Undeniable efficiency gains\n\nGenAI solutions can automate repetitive tasks like due diligence document review, speeding up deal processes and saving time for both lawyers and PE professionals. Many private fund advisers are feeling the pressure of heightened scrutiny from both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and limited partners (LPs). Meanwhile, operating costs are also rising, driving advisers to look for ways to maintain or cut spending.\n\nAI cannot replace experienced attorneys in providing complex legal services to PE clients, but it can serve as a valuable tool for augmenting legal professionals’ capabilities and improving overall efficiency.\n\nWhen law firms drill down, efficiency is a matter of speed and convenience for their clients. PE firms want their law firms to perform tasks faster and with less lift on their part. AI tools could enable law firms to reduce the turnaround times on routine, repetitive tasks while limiting the input they require from their clients.\n\n2. Greater value\n\nGiven how much private fund advisers invest in their relationships with outside counsel, advisers expect the firm to continuously provide value. The priority here is for the law firm to deliver value above what the AI tool offers. While AI will benefit clients by streamlining low-level tasks and reducing the law firm’s fees associated with those tasks, what new strategic work or expertise can the law firm provide to add value? For many lawyers, this is an exciting opportunity rather than a concern.\n\n3. Enhanced deal analysis and deeper insights\n\nAI tools can analyze vast amounts of data to identify potential risks and opportunities in deals that lawyers might miss. With a more comprehensive view of a deal, PE firms can make more informed investment decisions.\n\n4. Deliver differentiated value and a competitive advantage\n\nLaw firms that demonstrate expertise in AI are likely to be seen as more innovative and attractive partners by PE firms. By leveraging AI, law firms can offer PE firms a unique value proposition that goes beyond traditional legal services.\n\nAccording to Thomson Reuters’ 2023 Future of Professionals Report, 40% of legal respondents said their top goal for AI is to free them to focus on higher-level tasks — like structuring complex transactions, tax planning and structuring, and dispute resolution — ultimately delivering superior value to their clients by removing mundane tasks from the law firm’s workloads.\n\nFuture-proofing the practice: BigLaw’s approach to AI implementation\n\nWhile AI has tremendous potential for all law firms, BigLaw is where we’re already seeing significant moves in AI experimentation and implementation. Many global firms have developed specific practice groups dedicated to AI, technical innovation, and data analytics. Some firms have spent the last few years hiring data scientists and tech-savvy lawyers. A few have developed AI tools in-house with varying degrees of success\n\nAccording to a recent Thomson Reuters Report, Stepping into the future: How generative AI will help lawyers improve legal service delivery: “Some tasks will be automated, but the fundamental transformation will be how legal work is reimagined and improved. AI presents an enormous opportunity for legal because so much of what lawyers do today can be further enhanced with AI, and client outcomes can be improved.”\n\nWhile many large, global law firms see AI’s potential benefits, some concerns remain about accuracy, data privacy, and ethics. Overall, law firms are interested but still figuring out how GenAI can fit into their practices.\n\nGenAI tools aren’t performing legal analysis for clients, but they’re good at analyzing language to provide draft documents or answer questions. However, GenAI can’t fully interpret and apply the law to a client’s unique circumstances just yet.\n\nBecome a trusted AI adviser to clients\n\nWhatever AI strategy a law firm develops for itself, it’s also essential that the firm becomes a trusted adviser on AI for its clients. Private fund clients are looking to understand how AI works, what it is and isn’t good at, and if it’s trustworthy. Private funds often don’t have the internal bandwidth or expertise to navigate these questions on their own.\n\nBecoming a trusted adviser regarding AI takes considerable effort and time. The first step is to understand what AI tools are appropriate for private market firms. Thomson Reuters’ 2023 Future of Professionals Report noted that given law firms’ relationships with corporate clients, firms have a unique ability to ensure that businesses implement AI in a trusted way.\n\nAlso, pay close attention to the following:\n\nThe SEC’s proposed AI regulations\n\nThe Biden Administration’s AI-related executive orders and proposals\n\nThe American Bar Association’s guidance on AI use\n\nState bars’ and bar associations’ proposed or final rules on AI use\n\nWhat private equity firms want from law firms\n\nHere’s what PE firms want to see from their law firms regarding AI adoption:\n\n1. Understanding of AI applications\n\nLaw firms should clearly understand how AI can be applied to different aspects of the private equity deal process. PE firms expect law firms to invest in AI tools and train their lawyers on how to use them effectively. Law firms should be transparent about AI’s limitations and have lawyers with the expertise to interpret and validate its outputs.\n\n2. Identifying and evaluating AI tools\n\nDeveloping an internal knowledge base: Law firms are building expertise in AI tools relevant to private equity, like due diligence software, contract automation platforms, and legal research assistants. This allows them to advise clients on which tools best suit their specific needs and workflows.\n\nConducting pilot programs: Leading law firms should partner with AI vendors to pilot specific tools with select private equity clients. This allows them to assess the effectiveness, identify integration challenges, and provide valuable feedback to clients about the AI’s capabilities.\n\nCurating a trusted vendor network: Firms are compiling a list of reputable AI vendors offering solutions with proven track records in the private equity space to empower clients to make informed decisions without extensive independent research.\n\n3. Addressing data privacy & security\n\nSome fund managers are wary of AI using their proprietary and sensitive data or, even worse, somehow making it publicly available.\n\nDuring implementation, law firms should work to ensure any AI tool their lawyers or staff use doesn’t retain their clients’ proprietary, or sensitive information. Clients need their data to be safe and secure, and firms can assure them of that throughout the law firm’s digital transformation.\n\nWith any new AI tool a firm implements, leadership must be prepared to explain to clients how they’re protecting client data. Not only is this imperative to continuing the relationship, but it’s also a great way to help clients become more comfortable with the idea of adopting AI solutions internally and navigating the use of AI at their portfolio companies.\n\n4. Bolstering data management and quality assurance\n\nAdvising on data preparation: Law firms can guide clients on the importance of high-quality data training sets for AI tools. This ensures the accuracy and effectiveness of AI outputs for private equity tasks like due diligence or contract analysis.\n\nImplementing data governance policies: Law firms are developing data governance policies for managing client data used with AI tools to ensure data privacy, security, and compliance with relevant regulations. These can be shared with clients to help them establish their own policies.\n\nImplementing quality assurance checks: Firms are developing processes to assess the accuracy and reliability of AI outputs used in client work. This helps ensure legal teams don’t solely rely on AI results without verification.\n\n5. Sharing knowledge and thought leadership\n\nOrganizing AI-focused workshops: Law firms can host workshops or seminars for private equity clients to educate them on the benefits and applications of AI in their investment process.\n\nPublishing thought leadership content: Firms can publish articles, reports, or webinars showcasing how private equity clients can leverage AI for better outcomes.\n\nContributing to industry discussions: Firms should be participating in industry conferences or forums to position themselves as leaders in the conversation around AI integration for private equity success.\n\nChoosing wisely — not all AI tools are created equal\n\nBy taking these steps, big law firms are becoming valuable partners for private equity clients in their journey toward adopting and maximizing the benefits of AI tools.\n\nWhile many AI solutions are currently available, not all of them will accurately and efficiently address a private fund manager’s specific legal use cases. For example, a variety of contract management platforms use AI to streamline repetitive contract workflows. These platforms aren’t structured for private fund contracts, such as limited partnership agreements and side letters. Law firms and their PE clients are better off with a contract and obligation management solution built for their specific industry needs, or they’re unlikely to see a good return on investment.\n\nIn addition to having a good grasp of what’s available for PE clients, leading law firms can form strategic partnerships with the top AI providers. Whether formal or informal, a firm could generate value for clients by advising them on industry-specific AI tools and connecting them with trustworthy AI vendors.",

      "# [Ontra Company Overview, Contact Details & Competitors](https://leadiq.com/c/ontra/5a1d9d9d23000059008d79a1)\nBoston Scientific (BSX) mCRM System Study Outcome Favorable\n\nBoston Scientific Corporation (BSX Quick QuoteBSX - Free Report) recently presented favorable six-month results from the ongoing pivotal MODULAR ATP clinical trial of the mCRM System — the first modular cardiac rhythm management system that consists of the EMBLEM Subcutaneous Implantable Defibrillator or S-ICD System and the EMPOWER Leadless Pacemaker. The findings were concurrently published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the Heart Rhythm Society's annual meeting, Heart Rhythm 2024.The recent development will likely bolster Boston Scientific’s Cardiovascular business.About mCRM SystemThe device is designed to communicate wirelessly to coordinate painless intracardiac anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) therapy, provide rate-responsive bradycardia pacing support and prevent sudden cardiac death without the use of leads in the heart or under the sternum.The company anticipates FDA approval of the mCRM System in 2025. Study DetailsThe trial assessed not only the safety and functionality of the EMPOWER LP as a stand-alone pacemaker but also the efficacy of the EMBLEM S-ICD System in wirelessly requesting the LP to administer ATP treatment. The trial's results satisfied all predetermined six-month safety and efficacy criteria.The trial's results met all pre-established six-month safety and effectiveness endpoints. They showed that the EMPOWER Leadless Pacemaker was implanted with a major complication-free rate of 97.5%, that communication between the EMBLEM S-ICD System and the EMPOWER Leadless Pacemaker was successful in 98.8% of cases, that anti-tachycardia pacing was successful in 61.3% of cases and that no patient requested that anti-tachycardia pacing or bradycardia pacing be turned off because of pain or discomfort.Study Outcome BenefitsBoston Scientific observed outstanding overall clinical performance of the mCRM System in this trial, including a high rate of successful communication from the S-ICD to the leadless pacemaker and a low rate of serious leadless pacemaker problems. These findings are significant because the high percentages of communication success and pain-free termination of spontaneous arrhythmia episodes suggest a potential upgrade pathway for patients currently implanted with an S-ICD who require ATP or pacing.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInstead of exposing all patients to the risks of more invasive approaches, such as placing leads into the heart or tunneling them under the sternum to provide therapies they may not need, these findings suggest physicians may be able to tailor therapy to the patient's specific needs and health.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global cardiac rhythm management devices market size was estimated at $16.43 billion in 2023 and is expected to register a CAGR of 6.3% from 2024 to 2030.
