Pre/Dicta looks at every ump that looks just like yours, across the entire history of baseball, with every player that resembles every player on your team and the opponent, and every manager and coach that resembles every manager and coach in your game, and every weather forecast that was the same as your weather, and so on and so on... basically, it looks at trillions of data combinations, and will tell you how that Umpire is going to call the game... with 85% accuracy.  \n\nThe difference between conventional filter based analytics and Pre/Dicta is the difference between an Almanac and NASA AI/Machine Learning Climate forecasting.

They're scans, often compound documents (as in documents created at different times added together - a master with appendices and exhibits, or an amendment with schedules, toss in a few Work Orders in between things). As scans, they usually have random handwriting, artifacts, etc. As compound documents, they may have single column then double column, sometimes triple column, then it might switch to landscape orientation for printed spreadsheets tucked into the contract. I've found plenty of OCR that can address each item individually, but nothing that can correctly OCR the entire document. When the doc starts out single column then changes to double or triple column, most OCR ends up giving me single lines across (breaking the columns) which is useless.\nThe next issue is that contracts are stored as PDF, which, for text, means there are returns inserted at the end of each line (and they rarely correspond to the true end of a sentence.) As a result, I have to try to structure regex to look for phrases that may span a line, but I also need to capture the entire clause, which again proves quite difficult with end of line returns inserted throughout. Between the end of line returns and the OCR issues compound the complexity, since it generally means I can't rely on punctuation to be accurate (periods are often OCRd as commas, semicolons as commas, commas as periods, etc.)\n\nIf I have plain text, no OCR issues, and no odd returns throughout, I can handle things beautifully with regex. But the only way I get that is to manually fix the text.\n\n### Comment ID k9xs5r8 with +1 score by [(PLERoss, Reddit, 2023-11-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaltech/comments/17ewo3q/legal_ai_what_have_you_used_reviews/k9xs5r8/) (in reply to ID k9xp061):\nI’ve been looking too!

I don't find the work interesting and the hours are too gruelling. I'm 35F, single, no kids, and frankly not sure any of that is on the cards while I'm still in this job (last long term relationship ended 3 years ago).\n\nAny suggestions welcome on how to manage this transition as undoubtedly starting from scratch in a different field will involve a salary cut. Any ideas about what field I could look into joining also welcome.\n\nFinancially, I have 125k in ISA and 150k in DC pension. Current salary 140k, 25% bonus expected in June. I do not own property/am currently renting.\n\nLackluster financials are because I spent my twenties working minimum wage retail and studying open uni part time. When I was in sixth form my mum (single mum) was diagnosed with cancer and had trouble looking after my severely disabled sister, so I had to look after them both. Both passed in my twenties and I didn't graduate uni until 30 or start my current job until I was 31.\n\nPart of me is really dispirited about going from LE to HENRY and now potentially going back the other way, but I'm just so tired and unsure about what to do with my life.\n\n## Comment ID kvbtf3v with +123 score by [(motivatedfatty, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvbtf3v/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nI’ll give you the advice I give to people who come to see me about being burn out - My take on this is not to make big life decisions whilst totally burnt out. \n\nCan you safely make it to June to get the bonus? Do you have annual leave you can take? \n\nGet signed off for one month from your GP for burn out. Take some breathing space. You’ve worked very hard to get to where you are but your mental health is worth more than your income. Let yourself recover and have some space before deciding what to do next. I do acknowledge a month off for burn out in these firms would be very detrimental if you then decided you wanted to stay but resigning would also have the same impact. \n\nDo you like law? Can you imagine liking law? My husband is PQE6 with a great life balance working in house. Lower pay, and there are issues, but 4 day working week, weekends are his, no burn out. When in big firm he was overall more miserable with less life work balance. It might not be that law is the problem and that it’s the firm. You’ll drop salary but still have a good income for a nice life, particularly if you leave London.\n\n### Comment ID kvc5vf5 with +28 score by [(billbabybill, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvc5vf5/) (in reply to ID kvbtf3v):\nI am not convinced that being a lawyer in a corporate environment is for me, I find it really hard to \"care\" about big companies and their commercial interests.

From my perspective, very few people there actually care about the company and none of them are managers. The managers just try to convince to do things for “a greater good” so you put in free overtime and make them look good for their next promotion.\n\nIf you really do care about law, then go in house as others suggest, do the bits that you like on your contracted hours, and go home at 5 and switch off your phone / laptop.\n\nI made a career in a technical specialist field with a STEM background and caring about my employer (a big uk bank) and believing the corporate propaganda caused my burn out. Now I’m a consultant (because I like the work I did / do), earn more, stick to my contracted work time and am overall much happier. \n\nYes, I still suffer from post burn out, but I manage it a lot better and get back on track faster - by simply prioritising my needs over my employer’s or client’s needs. I guess your field is niche enough that skills and experience are hard to come by, so usually people involved can’t complain too hard as they don’t want to alienate you. \n\nAlso, once you set boundaries (especially at the beginning) and stick to them, people are forced to work around and accept it. I had been gaslighted in the past that I needed to prove myself every single day, but after some time realised that people earning more than me did less and sometimes even displayed their slacker attitude, but had no risk of getting fired. You’d be surprised how much of your experience was a result of you trying to be too pleasing to everyone. \n\nOne very last point of advice - go for some form of therapy. I for example tried CBT and al the insights I shared above my therapist brought out to me and really helped to start my mindset changed which (together with the job change and boundary setting) saved my sanity and my high earning job - as a matter of fact, I wasn’t HENRY when I was burnt out, but now am - with less stress. I relate as I come from a working family (did OU as well :) ) and it’s not worth sacrificing many years of high earning potential without trying different solutions first.\n\n#### Comment ID kvc9ht2 with +10 score by [(Kittykittycatcat1000, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvc9ht2/) (in reply to ID kvc5vf5):\nWhat about the civil service?

You are in a mugs game. The hours, stress, nature of the work and utter uselessness of what you do will grind you down. However, you can leave! And you are in an awesome position, you've done a great slog, got the CV stuff and you will walk your next gig. I moved in house and did the industry rounds. If you still want to work the  corporate ladder and want to do variety of work this is the route for you. If you want to FIRE its locum work.

If you care about freedom, have no major financial commitments and can live with the ego hit from peers, this one is for you. This is my current choice. \nOther alternatives could be taking a corporate role in the Arab world.

I know the feeling. Mine got so bad I would walk to work and think of I got hit by a car or a bus at least I'd be in hospital and couldn't be contacted for a few days / weeks. It felt like there was no escape. \n\nLeaving that company was the best thing that I ever did. I took a job with less responsibility within the same industry and within a month I was no longer burnt out and I missed the responsibility I had. Within 6 months I was yearning for more and felt uninspired. \n\nMy point is, like many others have said, burnout needs tending to. If you can take time off, leave your job or be signed off, then you may find you love your job but it's the relentlessness of it that's having an impact. \n\nLeaving that job was the best thing I ever did. It was so toxic, the hours were insane and the management ground everyone to the floor. When I was in that place (partly due to the management and general nature of the business), it felt like there was no where to go. We were told our competitors were terrible and I felt like I couldn't do the type of work we did anywhere else. \n\nThat was a lie, and I'm better paid, happier and doing better work than I've ever done. If you feel like the company could be the issue - leave, join somewhere which is less intense and you can spend a year or two figuring out what you'd like to do less stressed and with more time to consider. I spent just under 2 years at a new company after I burnt out, and then I took a promotion, a 20% salary increase and now I'm back on my feet and absolutely loving work. \n\nBurnout is no joke. Take it seriously and if you're aware of it and posting about it on Reddit, you need to quit your job and give yourself time to recuperate. You'll be surprised how quickly you return to normal once you're out of the situation!\n\n## Comment ID kvbvm2c with +3 score by [(Menryn1924, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvbvm2c/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nI wasn't a million miles away from your situation, but I didn't walk away from law - just that job.\n\nIf you get a job in-house or at another firm (with a better balance) you can be conservative with the date you can start, and push your firm to either put you on gardening leave or let you leave after less than your full notice period.

Got to 4yrs PQE at MC firm in Corproate law, burnt out and hated it. Quit and after a few months off pivoted and went into teaching. Loved it but after 2-3yrs (and having my first kid) realised the problem was not the law - it was corporate law. \n\nI'm now 4 years into private client practice. During my LPC, wills/probate etc was only given a cursory look in - and naive me at the time thought \"God that sounds so boring\". But turns out I LOVE it. My corporate deals never excited me, could never find it in myself to be excited about my deals on the front page of the FT. Now my job is PEOPLE, and it is personal to them, and I feel like I can help at what can be really difficult times of their lives. It's also highly technical so intellectually stimulating.\n\nIt has its moments, but mostly the job is 9 - 5.30, and I go home and have time with my family (which never would have happened if I hadn't left the city). It's non-transactional and not court based so it's totally feasible to do part time (I do 4 days pw). Of course the pay is never going to be anything like corporate- but I have a life now and that is more than worth the reduction in pay. \n\nDon't regret teaching but part of me wished I had take more time to think and pivoted then by changing specialisms!

If the job is making you miserable, it will get harder to change the longer you leave. However, might be good to decide what other field you would enjoy before you resign. Could it also be the company you work for rather than the field? Is there an option to take a sabbatical and seek some therapy before you decide?  - as burn out can make us look at a situation with a more negative perspective than what the reality actually is.

It is both a mental and physical thing.

Far far better than I did with just HALF of the workload. \n\nAnd I don't have to take 5htp every day.

They are not precious, your mind is, that's what makes you the money - so you need to protect it!   Second decide if it's the firm / sector or the job itself you don't like - might be better to work in another potentially low paying job to suss it out.  I was burnt out years back and wanted to leave everything and train as a teacher, however found a similar job in a different sector  - been very happy!  Maybe start interviewing and see how you feel.   Third, you should be able to get a mortgage in principle before leaving in case you wanted to buy a house and the next low paying job doesn't give you enough loan power ( also consider the probation period ).\n\n## Comment ID kvfuyis with +1 score by [(trbd003, Reddit, 2024-03-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvfuyis/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nCould you take some time out - either as a formal sabbatical from your job or just leave without having a job to go to?

And to your point about AI research, I work with a company that is heavily invested in AI and with the recent surge in LLMs such as GPT and Claude being so dominant as a general use and cheap alternative to modeling your own bespoke LM, Ruby is very well positioned to be a more dominant player in this area. Python has been the language of choice for LM development for many years but now more companies are shifting towards using LLM APIs and the Ruby community has (as they always do) stepped up and created fantastic libraries for interacting with these LLMs. I am extremely bullish on the future of Ruby and AI.\n\n### Comment ID ltwqt4f with +2 score by [(Beautiful_Exam_8301, Reddit, 2024-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/1gc9jh3/id_like_to_learn_rails_but/ltwqt4f/) (in reply to ID ltueyuo):\nYea thats a good point.

Unlike many of commenters here I have had great success and have found that being a seasoned Rails dev to be in high demand. That said, I am seeing a trend currently where frontend React devs are highly in demand.\n\nI was on the React train in the early days (2016'ish) and really thought that is was the future of frontend development. This really seems to be where the world has moved recently and React developers are generally in high demand, so it is generally a good skill to have on your resume.\n\nBUT, from what I have learned in my 12 years of being a primarily Rails dev is that DHH is pretty much always 2-3 years ahead of the industry and is almost always right. A lot of people will argue that Rails is \"dead\" but I whole heartedly disagree. I really think what they are doing with modern Javascript is where the future is, and Rails is embracing it and forging the path ahead.\n\nWhen the \"hot new thing\" in React was server side rendering (https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components), it really made me chuckle a bit. This has been the default for Rails since the beginning. Internet speed, browser capabilities, and the maturity of JavaScript has generally made these complicated front end frameworks mostly worthless IMO.\n\nAll that said, I would say learning Rails is a worthwhile endeavor. It's here to stay, and if you are proficient with Laravel it won't be a huge leap to learn Ruby/Rails, and it might even be a delight! It's definitely worth at least a few hours of your time to see if it jives with you. There are lots of opportunities out there.\n\n## Comment ID ltvrlez with +1 score by [(DisneyLegalTeam, Reddit, 2024-10-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/1gc9jh3/id_like_to_learn_rails_but/ltvrlez/) (in reply to ID 1gc9jh3):\nAre there a lot of remote Laravel jobs?

And even then, it would have to be damn near close to my dream job to even consider this. \n\nI understand why they ask. It's hard to share your work in fields where the content of your work is proprietary so the only way they can evaluate your work is a mock assignment. But on the other hand, an interview is a two way process. I'm taking a change on the company, just like they are taking a chance on me. At least that's the way I look at it.\n\n### Comment ID m5qne4r with +6 score by [(MrIrishSprings, Reddit, 2025-01-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1hujnsa/getting_this_after_6_interviews_is_crazy/m5qne4r/) (in reply to ID m5lpb8g):\n2 is ideal, 3 is my max. 4 is absolutely pushing it.

Send the assessments to the candidates. Not some random assignment. That sounds sketchy and sus.\n\nAcceptable rounds: HR initial, Hiring manager, panel interviews + completed assessment. This is for a highly technical, fintech group. So around 3 is acceptable. Some companies want rounds with upper management. I'd argue why? Do they not trust the hiring manager?

Yet, the options to manage these conditions are rapidly diminishing.\n\nPreviously, intermittent FMLA leave provided a lifeline pre covid 19, allowing individuals to manage their health or care for family members and complete job tasks. \n\nPost-COVID, however, the process has become increasingly restrictive. Benefits after 90 day furlow changed as you reapply for benefits, and for those changing employers in same industry or reapplying with an existing employer, a 12-month waiting period for FLMA is now standard for qualified leave. This leaves individuals without vital protections for an extended period, forcing them to endure worsening conditions such as new hvac technology that can cause serious discomfort for adults and children with COPS, lupus, and exasperated asthma.\n\nAdding to the challenge, most employers forcing workers back into the office continue to place workers in compromised environments—wet or dry commercial spaces, unbalanced air chemistry, High RH, AT—without accountability. \n\nThe government provides no oversight or mandates for thorough environmental assessments using proper people and measuring tools or environmental assessments by 3 rd parties without a relationship with stakeholders. \n\nInstead, investigators inspections often rely on visual evaluations, which fail to detect the microscopic organisms and complex indoor atmospheric chemistry that pose significant risks to individuals with respiratory conditions.\n\nThe absence of enforceable air and surface quality standards means that one in five households could face income loss and unnecessary exposure to environmental hazards. As this issue continues to expand nationally and globally, it’s critical for policymakers to implement real solutions that prioritize public health, ensure accountability, and protect those living with respiratory and environmental challenges.

After being here for this long I can now see that's not the case, specially on the compensation side. \r\nFurthermore, while all my friends and family are getting 15-20% raises for either promotions or scheduled performance raise that additionally factors in 8% inflation, we have received nothing but excuses from management on salary adjustments. \r\nWe were told that salaries were \"above market\" or competitive, but this completely disregards that despite the fact that something was \"above market\" when you joined, after accounting for inflation, that advantage goes away, and you're now stuck with a choice that despite the excuses, you are losing upwards of 10% salary just given the cost of everything right now.",

          "cons": "It becomes apparent early on that transparency and fairness, which were promised upfront, are nothing but empty words. Despite being quoted a specific compensation upon accepting the position, the actual earnings fell far short, and there was no effort to rectify this discrepancy. The disparity in salaries between employees at different levels, even when their job responsibilities are identical, is a major concern. The company avoids addressing these glaring discrepancies and crucial employee questions, such as the absence of a 401k match, during company-wide meetings. Management's response to salary adjustments has been nothing short of a constant stream of excuses. Despite initial claims that salaries were \"above market\" or competitive, these assertions fail to acknowledge the impact of inflation over time. What might have seemed like a favorable salary upon joining the company loses its advantage as the cost of living increases. In reality, employees are now faced with a disheartening choice, realizing that despite the excuses provided, they are effectively experiencing a salary reduction of over 10% due to the soaring cost of living. On top of the favoritism and broken promises, another disillusioning aspect of working at this company was the current lack of promotion opportunities. During the hiring process, they boasted about a high likelihood of upward mobility within a year, creating a sense of optimism among new employees. However, as time went on, it became evident that these promises were nothing more than empty assurances. The path to advancement has been riddled with obstacles. The lack of career growth opportunities and the feeling of being stuck in the same role for an extended period has added to the growing dissatisfaction with the company's management and their lack of commitment to their own promises. The most significant problem within this company is the rampant favoritism displayed by higher-ups. The issue of favoritism extends to the leadership team, where it is evident that many members of the c-suite surround themselves with friends. Consequently, any problems or concerns are either ignored or inadequately addressed, further contributing to a toxic work environment. Attempts to raise concerns to people partners about favoritism or any other issues proved futile, as they merely took note of the problem without offering any resolution. The lack of accountability and disregard for employee feedback further exacerbated the discontent. One incident that particularly highlighted the lack of accountability within the company was when a leader used a slur during a weekly team meeting. The company took an unreasonably long time to issue an apology, which, when it finally came, felt insincere and failed to hold the leader accountable for their behavior.",

We are big enough that you can focus on and develop in your area of expertise, but small enough that anyone can bring ideas to the table and make a difference. We have also embraced being fully remote which means I get to shift what used to be commute time into family time. In order to do this well, the company has put in a lot of support structures to ensure that we have the tools be successful + appropriate opportunities to meet up with and work alongside each other in person.

After being here for this long I can now see that's not the case, specially on the compensation side. \r\nFurthermore, while all my friends and family are getting 15-20% raises for either promotions or scheduled performance raise that additionally factors in 8% inflation, we have received nothing but excuses from management on salary adjustments. \r\nWe were told that salaries were \"above market\" or competitive, but this completely disregards that despite the fact that something was \"above market\" when you joined, after accounting for inflation, that advantage goes away, and you're now stuck with a choice that despite the excuses, you are losing upwards of 10% salary just given the cost of everything right now.",

Despite being quoted a specific compensation upon accepting the position, the actual earnings fell far short, and there was no effort to rectify this discrepancy. The disparity in salaries between employees at different levels, even when their job responsibilities are identical, is a major concern. The company avoids addressing these glaring discrepancies and crucial employee questions, such as the absence of a 401k match, during company-wide meetings. Management's response to salary adjustments has been nothing short of a constant stream of excuses. Despite initial claims that salaries were \"above market\" or competitive, these assertions fail to acknowledge the impact of inflation over time. What might have seemed like a favorable salary upon joining the company loses its advantage as the cost of living increases. In reality, employees are now faced with a disheartening choice, realizing that despite the excuses provided, they are effectively experiencing a salary reduction of over 10% due to the soaring cost of living. On top of the favoritism and broken promises, another disillusioning aspect of working at this company was the current lack of promotion opportunities. During the hiring process, they boasted about a high likelihood of upward mobility within a year, creating a sense of optimism among new employees. However, as time went on, it became evident that these promises were nothing more than empty assurances. The path to advancement has been riddled with obstacles. The lack of career growth opportunities and the feeling of being stuck in the same role for an extended period has added to the growing dissatisfaction with the company's management and their lack of commitment to their own promises. The most significant problem within this company is the rampant favoritism displayed by higher-ups. The issue of favoritism extends to the leadership team, where it is evident that many members of the c-suite surround themselves with friends. Consequently, any problems or concerns are either ignored or inadequately addressed, further contributing to a toxic work environment. Attempts to raise concerns to people partners about favoritism or any other issues proved futile, as they merely took note of the problem without offering any resolution. The lack of accountability and disregard for employee feedback further exacerbated the discontent. One incident that particularly highlighted the lack of accountability within the company was when a leader used a slur during a weekly team meeting. The company took an unreasonably long time to issue an apology, which, when it finally came, felt insincere and failed to hold the leader accountable for their behavior.",

      "# [Ontra Unveils Accord, AI-Powered Software Revolutionizing Contract Negotiation in Private Markets on 2025-02-25](https://www.ontra.ai/press-release/ontra-unveils-accord-ai-powered-software-revolutionizing-contract-negotiation-private-markets/)\nNew AI-Powered Software Solution Streamlines and Simplifies Contract Negotiation, Saving Time and Reducing Cost\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, February 25, 2025 – Ontra, the global leader in AI-powered legal technology for private markets, today announced the launch of Accord, an innovative software solution that transforms contract negotiation. By automating routine contracts, Accord enables firms to reduce costs, accelerate deal flow, and free up in-house teams for higher-value work.\n\nFor private markets firms, contract negotiations are often slow, inconsistent, and expensive, diverting resources from core business priorities. When outsourced to traditional law firms, this runs up high legal bills and incurs additional overhead. When processed manually in-house, the time-consuming, tedious work leads to errors and unnecessary back-and-forth. Accord eliminates manual work associated with contract negotiation and management, allowing customers to easily negotiate, analyze, and manage their routine contracts, saving an early adopter 67% of the time spent per contract. Powered by Ontra’s AI engine, Accord automates contract workflows and surfaces insights for private funds managers.\n\n“As we grew larger, we began processing more NDAs,” said George Weekes, Managing Partner at Morningside Capital Inc. “We knew that we had to find a way to improve our process and make things more efficient and consistent. Ontra’s Accord was just what we were looking for. It allowed us to have a consistent approach to NDAs and streamline our workflow.”\n\nAccord helps teams craft detailed negotiation playbooks, surfaces precedent, and automatically suggests relevant markups with AI purpose-built for private markets. The product allows users to:\n\nSave time and expense with AI-powered workflows that automate manual tasks to streamline contract negotiation and review.\n\nImprove negotiation consistency and quality by leveraging their firm’s preferred negotiating positions and precedent.\n\nGet real-time visibility into the status of ongoing negotiations, enabling greater collaboration across teams.\n\n“Accord marks a fundamental shift in contract negotiation, bringing the power of AI to the private markets,” said Ontra CEO and Founder Troy Pospisil. “By eliminating inefficiencies and automating tedious processes, we’re empowering firms to move faster, focus on higher-value initiatives, and maintain a competitive edge.”\n\nOntra will add several more AI-powered solutions to its platform this year, expanding the suite of products that automate critical workflows across the fund lifecycle. Ontra works side-by-side with the largest fund managers in the world to develop products that completely solve key challenges. Its newest products in development will streamline due diligence questionnaires, simplify Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, and further accelerate contract negotiation timelines.\n\nTo discover how Accord can revolutionize your contract negotiations, visit www.ontra.ai/products/accord/.\n\nAbout Ontra\n\nOntra is the global leader in AI legal tech for private markets.

Now they can spend their time on what matters most — whether that’s important work or getting home in time for dinner.\n\nOntra’s origins\n\nCEO and founder Troy Pospisil formed the idea for Ontra — previously InCloudCounsel — while working in private equity investing. He loved the industry but saw the inefficiencies. The high volume of repetitive, mundane work. The generic legacy tech. The unnecessary late nights.\n\nTroy knew that modern legal tech could be the solution. He partnered with his friend and Kirkland & Ellis lawyer, Ben Levi, to pursue combining a unique labor model with best-in-class technology with the intention of creating an end-to-end contract negotiation solution.\n\nAlong with their third, tech-focused co-founder, Lane Lillquist, the trio set out to build their first solution, Contract Automation — initially known as Document Processing.\n\nTheir vision was clear: Create a world where professionals have more time to focus on what is important to them. Customers would be free from time-consuming, manual tasks and able to better focus on high-value work, while lawyers could build practices free from traditional employment and geographic constraints.\n\nWhen it came time to sell their unique solution to customers, Troy slept on friends’ couches, stamped hundreds of envelopes, and walked miles across NYC to book meetings. It was a labor of love, sweat, and tears that paid off when Ontra celebrated processing 1,000,000 documents a decade later.\n\nGrowth of Ontra’s private markets technology platform\n\nOntra’s ever-expanding private markets technology platform addresses the full spectrum of legal workflows required to fundraise, invest, and operate funds. Through a combination of purpose-built applications, a proprietary AI engine leveraging leading LLMs, and a global Legal Network, Ontra provides more than 800 customers with innovative solutions backed by years of industry expertise.\n\nContract Automation\n\nCustomers leverage Ontra’s AI-powered platform and a global network of independent law firms to automate and streamline processes related to contract intake, negotiation, and execution.\n\nContract Automation has evolved significantly since the early days of Document Processing. We continue to expand contract types, from NDAs to vendor agreements and LP transfers. Our customers’ lawyers now use digital playbooks, our proprietary AI redlining tool, Markup Builder, and a centralized solution with automated notifications to speed up negotiations. Our AI and GPT-4 integration continue to boost AI-powered features, from markup suggestions to quickly summarizing executed agreements.\n\nOver 700 firms trust Contract Automation, including Blackstone, KKR, Carlyle, and Fir Tree Partners. Learn more about how Blackstone closes high-caliber investments faster, and Fir Tree cut negotiation times in half with Ontra.\n\nInsight\n\nThroughout the first six years, Ontra grew to over 50 employees and 300 customers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The business developed close relationships with private fund managers and asset managers and, through these close ties, Ontra discovered growing pain points around side letter management and compliance. Firms had too many side letters and obligations to effectively track in a spreadsheet. The team at Ontraset out to build another solution.\n\nWith Insight, customers leverage AI to digitize their LPAs and side letters and create a central repository. They now have a searchable, digital compendia containing all of their categorized obligations and where they can assign tasks and pull reports to support their compliance efforts. We are continually adding to Insight’s features, such as the recent additions of digital MFN elections and AI Search.\n\nLeading managers worldwide, including Blackstone, Battery Ventures, AllianceBernstein, Silverlake, L Catterton, and Pharos Capital Group, rely on Insight. Learn how Pharos accelerated their SEC exam response with Insight’s search and reporting capabilities.\n\nAtlas\n\nOntra’s most recently launched product modernizes legal entity management to automate Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) filings and other compliance workflows. Once again, Ontra’s growing team focused on a solution that would specifically address our customers’ legal and compliance needs.\n\nOne Equity Partners, Glendower Capital, Ridgemont Equity Partners, and more rely on Atlas to manage their entity information in a single AI-enabled platform, generate customizable structure charts, and automate CTA filings.\n\nSynapse\n\nOntra’s AI engine, Synapse, is a cutting-edge combination of proprietary models and third-party LLMs, including OpenAI’s GPT-4.\n\nSynapse:\n\nIs safe and secure: Customer data is carefully guarded and not used to train third-party models.\n\nIs designed for private markets: Purpose-built for private market contracts and workflows.\n\nGenerates customer-specific results: Data is fetched in real time for quick and relevant results.\n\nRelies on a human-in-the-loop model: Dedicated professionals review AI-generated results.\n\nOur industry-leading AI provides solutions to solve our customers’ unique and complex problems. Synapse enables us to deploy reliable AI features throughout our platform, speeding up legal tasks across the fund lifecycle, lowering costs, and empowering professionals with immediate knowledge of their contracts and obligations.\n\nThe Legal Network\n\nOur global network of independent legal professionals is a key part of our human-in-the-loop philosophy. While AI and legal tech have advanced significantly in the last year — and even recent months — neither can take the place of legal professionals’ insight and judgment.\n\nOur Legal Network features more than 600 legal professionals, giving our customers access to human insight in addition to our AI-powered solutions.\n\nTimeline: Ontra through the years\n\n2014-17: InCloudCounsel launches its Contract Automation solution and opens three offices across the U.S.\n\n2016: InCloudCounsel adds proprietary machine learning to Contract Automation.\n\n2018: InCloudCounsel opens a London office.\n\n2019: InCloudCounsel completes a $40M Series A fundraise with Battery Ventures and opens an office in Asia.\n\n2020: InCloudCounsel grows beyond 50 employees and reaches 300 customers across the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific.\n\n2021: InCloudCounsel rebrands as Ontra, goes to market with Insight, launches its philanthropic program, The Legal Aid Alliance, and completes a $200M Series B fundraise with Blackstone Growth.\n\n2022: Ontra makes two business acquisitions, grows to over 300 employees, and reaches 500 customers.\n\n2023: Ontra launches Atlas, integrates OpenAI’s GPT-4 into Synapse, and expands The Legal Aid Alliance to Europe and Asia-Pacific.\n\n2024: Ontra reaches over 1 million contracts processed through its solutions and celebrates 10 years.\n\nClosing the justice gap\n\nMany Ontra employees were practicing lawyers in their previous lives and understand the chasm between the need for legal representation and the legal resources available for vulnerable and low-income communities. Ontra believes in playing a part in closing what’s known as “the justice gap.”\n\nWe donate $1 for every document processed through our solutions. In 2023, we donated $292,903 — our highest annual amount to date. It was our first year including documents processed through Insight and the first year we gave our customers the option of Ontra donating an additional sum rather than sending a traditional holiday gift.\n\nIn three years, Ontra’s Legal Aid Alliance has donated over $572,000 to legal aid nonprofits across the U.S.\n\nLooking to the future of AI legal tech\n\nOntra has never strayed from the original vision: To create a world where professionals have more time to focus on what is important to them.",
      "# [AL NIBs: Caddi, Altumatim, Legora + AG, ContractPodAi + Epiq, Ontra, Intapp on 2025-03-07](https://www.artificiallawyer.com/2025/03/07/al-nibs-caddi-altumatim-legora-ag-contractpodai-ontra-intapp/)\nHere’s some of the top news stories you may have missed this week, all in today’s AL NIBs.\n\nCaddi Raises $5m For AI-Driven Process Automations\n\nCaddi has raised $5m in seed funding to offer what it calls a ‘record-to-code’ platform which ‘watches how [you] work – whether it’s client intake, document management, or billing – and transforms those actions into fully functional, API-driven automations’.\n\nTheir tagline is: ‘If you can record it, we can automate it’. An interesting approach indeed.\n\nCo-founder & CEO Alejandro Castellano, said: ‘Our ‘automation by demonstration’ approach means professionals can train Caddi just like they would a new hire. No coding, no IT team, no workflow disruption. Just show Caddi what you do, and it does the rest.’\n\nFor example, it can help to build custom automations for:\n\nClient Onboarding\n\nEmail Management\n\nDocument Organization\n\nData Entry\n\nBilling & Invoicing\n\nOf course, the proof is in the automated pudding…..But it looks promising.\n\nYou can find more about the company here.\n\n—\n\nContractPodAi + Epiq Partner Together For GenAI\n\nCLM company ContractPodAi is partnering with Epiq, with the former’s Leah genAI assistant now offered as part of Epiq’s multi-capability Service Cloud. Moreover, Epiq will act as an implementation partner for the adoption of the AI system.\n\nThe move follows other partnerships by the CLM business, including with KPMG, PwC and Integreon.\n\nSarvarth Misra, CEO and co-founder of ContractPodAi, said: ‘By embedding Leah into Epiq’s ecosystem, together we aren’t just improving efficiency – we’re fundamentally changing how legal work gets done. Leah will help clients automate complex processes, make informed decisions, and scale their operations with unprecedented speed and accuracy.’\n\n—\n\nStartup Altumatim Launches ‘Story-Driven’ AI Dispute Analysis\n\nUS-based startup, Altumatim, has launched altumatimOSTM, which provides a ‘story-driven’ approach to dispute analysis.\n\nKey features include:\n\n‘Story-Based Intelligence: By understanding a case’s narrative context, altumatimOS delivers more accurate and relevant results than keyword-based approaches.\n\nAutonomous Investigation: The platform’s super-agent orchestrator deploys multiple AI agents to analyze datasets comprehensively, forming independent insights about the most relevant information to each case.\n\nCollaborative Co-Authoring: The super-agent works alongside users to continuously update and refine case narratives as new evidence is discovered.’\n\nIf you look beyond the jargon, basically this is a tool that focuses on case narratives. But, may be of interest.\n\n—\n\nSmall GenAI Benchmark Study Compares vLex vs OpenAI o1\n\nA new, but quite limited, benchmark study from the law schools at the University of Minnesota and the University of Michigan found that Vincent AI from vLex ‘hallucinated significantly less than OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model’.\n\nThe study compared legal tasks performed by upper-level law students using Vincent AI and OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model.\n\nResults from the report found that ‘AI assistance significantly boosts productivity in five out of six tested legal tasks’. And that ‘RAG technology, such as that used by Vincent AI, does indeed reduce hallucinations. In fact, we identified fewer hallucinations in assignments completed with Vincent AI (3 total) than in those completed without any AI assistance at all (4). By contrast, assignments completed with o1-preview exhibited a substantially higher number of hallucinations (11).’\n\nSo, not a massive study, but the results help to establish that 1) genAI is useful for legal work, and 2) legal-orientated tools – for now – perform better than generalist genAI approaches.\n\n—\n\nAddleshaws Signs Up With Legora\n\nAfter a busy few weeks for Legora, Addleshaw Goddard has now announced they are bringing them aboard. They’ve had a name change, Bird & Bird brought them in full-time after a pilot, and Mishcon de Reya has started a pilot as well.\n\nOne example of a use case Addleshaw gave was this:\n\n‘Legora’s Tabular Review tool enables the bulk upload of documents to answer specific questions or extractions and can analyse up to 100,000 documents in parallel. The speed of this feature allows the team to add queries immediately, building out complex reviews within an easy-to-use and collaborative interface.’\n\nMichael Kennedy, Head of Innovation & Legal Technology – R&D at Addleshaw Goddard, said: ‘A combination of the speed of development and responsiveness of the platform and the positive collaboration with Legora’s team was key to our decision.’\n\n—\n\nOntra Tackles Contract Negotiation\n\nOntra has announced the launch of Accord for contract negotiation, which ‘eliminates manual work associated with contract negotiation and management’. It allows you to leverage preferred negotiating positions and precedents; and get real-time visibility into the status of ongoing negotiations, enabling greater collaboration across teams.\n\n—\n\nIntapp Launches Client Relationship-Focused DealCloud Activator\n\nIntapp has launched DealCloud Activator, which ‘surfaces real-time insights and actionable nudges that guide professionals to proactively support client relationships throughout the entire client lifecycle — without disrupting their daily routines’.\n\nBeyond the word salad, here is what it can do:\n\nRelationship and opportunity signals: Changes in key relationships — such as job changes, cooling contacts, and company news — are proactively fed to users with AI-driven signals and insights.\n\nBehavioral nudges: Timely, relevant reminders on best next actions are integrated into daily workflows to foster consistent engagement.\n\nTech stack integration: Integration with email, LinkedIn, and other tools lets users act on nudges directly from the alert.=\n\nHolistic data pictures: Connecting third-party data with proprietary firm history, ensures that recommendations are built off a rich, unique set of data specific to each professional and their clients.\n\nAnd more.\n\n—\n\nNote: Maybe it’s just AL, but it feels like the jargon quotient in legal tech company announcements is really increasing. One reason is perhaps PR teams using tools such as ChatGPT that may be packing the text with buzz words – and way too many hyperbolic adjectives, or maybe it’s because of over-the-top SEO efforts? Another possible reason is all the talk of agent this, and AI model that, is bamboozling not just the legal market, but the marketing teams of the tech companies themselves?",

Three of the dimensions are connected to the actions of leaders and building trust: credibility, respect, and fairness.

The trial's results satisfied all predetermined six-month safety and efficacy criteria.The trial's results met all pre-established six-month safety and effectiveness endpoints. They showed that the EMPOWER Leadless Pacemaker was implanted with a major complication-free rate of 97.5%, that communication between the EMBLEM S-ICD System and the EMPOWER Leadless Pacemaker was successful in 98.8% of cases, that anti-tachycardia pacing was successful in 61.3% of cases and that no patient requested that anti-tachycardia pacing or bradycardia pacing be turned off because of pain or discomfort.Study Outcome BenefitsBoston Scientific observed outstanding overall clinical performance of the mCRM System in this trial, including a high rate of successful communication from the S-ICD to the leadless pacemaker and a low rate of serious leadless pacemaker problems. These findings are significant because the high percentages of communication success and pain-free termination of spontaneous arrhythmia episodes suggest a potential upgrade pathway for patients currently implanted with an S-ICD who require ATP or pacing.Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInstead of exposing all patients to the risks of more invasive approaches, such as placing leads into the heart or tunneling them under the sternum to provide therapies they may not need, these findings suggest physicians may be able to tailor therapy to the patient's specific needs and health.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global cardiac rhythm management devices market size was estimated at $16.43 billion in 2023 and is expected to register a CAGR of 6.3% from 2024 to 2030. The growing prevalence of various cardiovascular diseases, such as arrhythmia and atrial fibrillation, among others.Other Notable HighlightsIn February 2024, Boston Scientific gained the FDA’s approval for the FARAPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) system, which is indicated for the isolation of pulmonary veins in the treatment of drug-refractory, recurrent, symptomatic, paroxysmal (i.e., intermittent) atrial fibrillation. The system represents a unique new alternative to standard-of-care thermal ablation treatment.Earlier in 2023, Boston Scientific completed enrollment in the first phase of the ADVANTAGE AF clinical trial, which is studying the FARAPULSE PFA system for treating patients with drug-refractory, symptomatic, persistent AF. The company also commenced enrollment in a second phase of the study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the adjunctive use of the FARAPOINT PFA Catheter for cavotricuspid isthmus ablations — a procedure used to treat atrial flutter.

      "# [The New Code of Law: How AI Will Revolutionize the Legal Sector by Megan O'Leary on 2024-06-05](https://www.battery.com/blog/the-new-code-of-law/)\nAt Battery, we’re laser-focused on identifying verticals where AI adoption isn’t just a boardroom talking point, but a seamless solution to real pain points. In our view, healthcare is clearly one of those verticals; government contracting is another. We’re equally enthusiastic about AI’s potential to transform the legal industry.\n\nWhen we recently attended Legalweek in New York, we saw firsthand how excited the legal community is becoming about AI, too. Nearly all the event programming centered on AI implementation, with attendees eager to learn best practices on how to benefit from AI tools. And for good reason: according to LexisNexis, 90% of law firms plan to increase their investment in generative AI over the next 5 years.\n\nSo, what comes next? Through our analysis and conversations with over 70 legal AI startups, we’ve identified three key areas where AI is poised to revolutionize legal workflows:\n\nLegal Research and Review: AI can streamline discovery and search, quickly identifying relevant data and automating document reviews.\n\nContract Drafting and Negotiation: From implementing playbooks to automated hyperlinking, AI can expedite document creation and assist in negotiations.\n\nPatents and Intellectual Property: We anticipate the emergence of tools that can parse complex documents and identify prior art, completely transforming the patent landscape.\n\nIt’s crucial to recognize that the legal AI market is diverse, with distinct buyer personas possessing unique needs, challenges and decision-making processes. Startups targeting large law firms should be prepared to collaborate closely with IT departments and tailor features to each client’s specific workflows. Conversely, startups serving small law firms may find success with a product-led growth strategy that minimizes onboarding requirements.\n\nWhile data security, change management and the reduction of billable hours present significant challenges, the momentum behind AI adoption in the legal industry is robust. Firms and practitioners who embrace this technology will gain a competitive edge, enhancing their ability to serve clients effectively and efficiently.\n\nLegal Research and Review\n\nLitigation workflows are a perfect example of a process rife with inefficiencies that are neatly addressable by AI. As casework begins, legal teams upload vast collections of documents into repositories and then spend countless hours meticulously sorting through each document to uncover relevant sources and exhibits. Only then can lawyers begin constructing their arguments. This knowledge bank must be revisited multiple times throughout a case’s lifespan, which can span years, necessitating a refresh of the team’s case knowledge every few months. This triggers a repetitive cycle of legal document search-and-review each time the case is revisited.\n\nTedious legal workflows, such as timeline reconstruction, demand detailed oversight of massive document volumes. Huge amounts of data and proprietary knowledge languish in various document repositories, preventing teams from extracting full potential value.\n\nWe see a prime opportunity for AI-powered startups to enable legal teams to parse their data more efficiently, automatically synthesize documents, quickly refresh case knowledge and surface relevant content. By leveraging AI assistance, lawyers can focus more on case strategy and better serve their clients’ needs.\n\nContract Drafting and Negotiation\n\nWe’ve seen many startups target contract drafting and negotiation as a main focus, and for good reason: the technology is clearly ready for primetime in this domain. AI excels at reading contracts and detecting inconsistencies compared to historical documents and internal playbooks. It can also draft red lines and provide negotiation guidelines.\n\nOntra*, a Battery portfolio company in the AI-contracting space, uses AI to handle the initial 90% of the contract process, with their Ontra Legal Network serving as the human-in-the-loop to finalize contracts for private market clients. We see significant opportunities in this segment for startups to differentiate by focusing on different buyer personas (e.g., biglaw, midlaw, solo) and contract types (from bespoke, highly complex negotiations to high-volume, simple agreements).\n\nPatents and Intellectual Property\n\nAnother compelling application of AI within the legal domain is in the realm of patents and intellectual property (IP). Patents are extremely dense, long filings with very technical language. Patents in the U.S. alone are valued at over $3T. The process of getting a patent approved can take up to two years, but the lifetime of the patent is 20 years (as long as the maintenance payments are made on time). Large corporations will protect their patent portfolio with armies of lawyers serving to defend the firm against IP lawsuits and to catch infringements.\n\nAnd it makes sense why: Patent litigation costs $2.3-$4M in fees on average with patent damages costing the US market over $4.6B annually. The intricate nature of patent language, coupled with the high stakes involved in IP litigation, positions AI as a strong potential ally in this space. We anticipate the development of tools capable of parsing complex documents and identifying prior art, transforming the patent landscape and providing users with unparalleled insight and efficiency.\n\nConclusion and Market Opportunity\n\nWith over 1.3 million active lawyers in the U.S. alone, the potential for AI to reshape the very nature of legal practice is immense. As the industry navigates this transformative period, LLMs are elegantly addressing major pain points in legal workflows that involve vast amounts of unstructured data. Buyer appetite has surged in the past year, and we believe the legal AI reference stack is currently being established.\n\nIf you are building in this space, we’d love to talk!"
