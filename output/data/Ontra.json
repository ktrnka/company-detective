When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such personal data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require such data.\n\nProfile or contact information\n\nIdentifiers\n\nPayment data\n\nDevice/IP data\n\nOther personal data you choose to provide\n\nLegitimate Interest: We process the following categories of personal data when we believe it furthers the legitimate interest of us or third parties:\n\nProfile or contact information\n\nIdentifiers\n\nPayment Data\n\nDevice/IP data\n\nAnalytics data\n\nGeolocation Data\n\nOther personal data you choose to provide\n\nWe may also de-identify or anonymize personal data to further our legitimate interests\n\nExamples of these legitimate interests include (as described in more detail above):\n\nProviding, customizing, and improving the Services\n\nMarketing the Services\n\nCorresponding with you\n\nProvision of customer support\n\nProtecting from fraud or security threats\n\nMeeting legal requirements and enforcing legal terms\n\nCompleting corporate transactions\n\nConsent: In some cases and where required by law, we may collect or process personal data based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such data.

In some circumstances, your personal data may be transferred to the U.S. pursuant to a data processing agreement incorporating standard data protection clauses.\n\nEU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework\n\nOntra complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively, “DPF”).\n\nOntra has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, including the principles of 1) notice, 2) choice, 3) accountability for onward transfer, 4) security, 5) data integrity and purpose limitation, 6) access, and 7) recourse, enforcement, and liability. Ontra has also certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.\n\nThe DPF Principles require that we remain potentially liable if any third party processing personal data on our behalf fails to comply with these DPF Principles (except to the extent we are not responsible for the event giving rise to any alleged damage). Ontra’s compliance with the DPF is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\n\nPlease contact us as described below with any questions or concerns relating to our DPF Certification. In compliance with the DPF, Ontra commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the DPF to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.

The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, you may also be entitled to invoke binding arbitration for complaints not resolved by other means.\n\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.

At the other end of the spectrum are the complex contract management systems that aren't  designed for contract review but try, like Ironclad --  (if you're in Europe, maybe Juro). Perhaps the best option for you: specialized and focused just on contract review, you would find a company like LegalOn. If you're in Europe, maybe something like Robin (although that is less AI and more about human support).\n\n## Comment ID k6fovon with +4 score by [(4vrf, Reddit, 2023-10-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaltech/comments/17ewo3q/legal_ai_what_have_you_used_reviews/k6fovon/) (in reply to ID 17ewo3q):\nThere is a chrome extension for research called [Counsel Companion](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/counsel-companion-researc/clclbbpdnecmfmlnfkmkjalaljfjhlpl).

From there I ask it theoretical claim questions like, “I had X happen to me and attempted to clarify it with merchant—no resolve was offered from X and I’m requesting a full refund.”  The AI program would respond with likelihoods for claim denials, citing articles within the T&C, or not (alluding to increased likelihood of claim approval).               Does something like this exist?                                          I just had a lackluster chargeback experience with Visa where they so easily could have warned me, as I made the claim, that it would very likely get denied and here’s why ______.  But no.                                          So that means it’s up to me (us)♥️\n\n## Comment ID kyw33m3 with +1 score by [(Realistic_Wolf_6446, Reddit, 2024-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaltech/comments/17ewo3q/legal_ai_what_have_you_used_reviews/kyw33m3/) (in reply to ID 17ewo3q):\nI'm using Pincites and the functionality is great, and they help you build out whatever playbooks you need to get started immediately.

They're scans, often compound documents (as in documents created at different times added together - a master with appendices and exhibits, or an amendment with schedules, toss in a few Work Orders in between things). As scans, they usually have random handwriting, artifacts, etc. As compound documents, they may have single column then double column, sometimes triple column, then it might switch to landscape orientation for printed spreadsheets tucked into the contract. I've found plenty of OCR that can address each item individually, but nothing that can correctly OCR the entire document. When the doc starts out single column then changes to double or triple column, most OCR ends up giving me single lines across (breaking the columns) which is useless.\nThe next issue is that contracts are stored as PDF, which, for text, means there are returns inserted at the end of each line (and they rarely correspond to the true end of a sentence.) As a result, I have to try to structure regex to look for phrases that may span a line, but I also need to capture the entire clause, which again proves quite difficult with end of line returns inserted throughout. Between the end of line returns and the OCR issues compound the complexity, since it generally means I can't rely on punctuation to be accurate (periods are often OCRd as commas, semicolons as commas, commas as periods, etc.)\n\nIf I have plain text, no OCR issues, and no odd returns throughout, I can handle things beautifully with regex. But the only way I get that is to manually fix the text.\n\n### Comment ID k9xs5r8 with +1 score by [(PLERoss, Reddit, 2023-11-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaltech/comments/17ewo3q/legal_ai_what_have_you_used_reviews/k9xs5r8/) (in reply to ID k9xp061):\nI’ve been looking too!

Now when I look at recruitment websites the number of those doc review jobs has dropped ~90%, and they often want someone who is fluent in a language like Russian or Arabic. Law firms are now using AI software like Ontra and GoogleDocAi for doc review. \n\nThis is just one sector, many others are facing this reality.\n\nI’m a huge proponent of AI, but the fear that a lot of people have towards AI is justified in my opinion.

In that case, you would hate any AI that could automate just some part of your job. \n\nIt is also why every tech CEO is advocating for universal basic income, people would hate an AI that took away their way of living, but if someday you get fired because of an AI but you were told you would still get paid for doing nothing most people would love the AI. \n\nFun note its the same with the generative copy right debate, its not that artist have a good case against AI using their copyright material or for that sake really care about copy right. However making art and uploading it to deviant art so that some AI may train on it is not going to make any money, so most artist have to do commissions for clients in order to pay the bill, as far as I know all artist hate doing the commissions as they limit their creative freedom.

We can’t even tax Starbucks properly! How will money taken from the exchequer to run basic services be found? Gov’ts have no plan for 90% unemployment. If there is UBI, what will it be?

This might be a whole new economic system we need to find yet no one has provided yet. \n\nAI will provide huge amounts of power to unelected companies and remove power from the ppl.

On the long run, however, it will hopefullu be positive and allow us to spend our time on what we decide instead of burning our lifes working. And, about money and so on, there are multiple options, and governmets should start working on making this transition phase smooth for societies (of course they won't do it until they can get some political benefit from it, which will be too late).

I don't find the work interesting and the hours are too gruelling. I'm 35F, single, no kids, and frankly not sure any of that is on the cards while I'm still in this job (last long term relationship ended 3 years ago).\n\nAny suggestions welcome on how to manage this transition as undoubtedly starting from scratch in a different field will involve a salary cut. Any ideas about what field I could look into joining also welcome.\n\nFinancially, I have 125k in ISA and 150k in DC pension. Current salary 140k, 25% bonus expected in June. I do not own property/am currently renting.\n\nLackluster financials are because I spent my twenties working minimum wage retail and studying open uni part time. When I was in sixth form my mum (single mum) was diagnosed with cancer and had trouble looking after my severely disabled sister, so I had to look after them both. Both passed in my twenties and I didn't graduate uni until 30 or start my current job until I was 31.\n\nPart of me is really dispirited about going from LE to HENRY and now potentially going back the other way, but I'm just so tired and unsure about what to do with my life.\n\n## Comment ID kvbtf3v with +122 score by [(motivatedfatty, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvbtf3v/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nI’ll give you the advice I give to people who come to see me about being burn out - My take on this is not to make big life decisions whilst totally burnt out. \n\nCan you safely make it to June to get the bonus? Do you have annual leave you can take? \n\nGet signed off for one month from your GP for burn out. Take some breathing space. You’ve worked very hard to get to where you are but your mental health is worth more than your income. Let yourself recover and have some space before deciding what to do next. I do acknowledge a month off for burn out in these firms would be very detrimental if you then decided you wanted to stay but resigning would also have the same impact. \n\nDo you like law? Can you imagine liking law? My husband is PQE6 with a great life balance working in house. Lower pay, and there are issues, but 4 day working week, weekends are his, no burn out. When in big firm he was overall more miserable with less life work balance. It might not be that law is the problem and that it’s the firm. You’ll drop salary but still have a good income for a nice life, particularly if you leave London.\n\n### Comment ID kvc5vf5 with +27 score by [(billbabybill, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvc5vf5/) (in reply to ID kvbtf3v):\nI am not convinced that being a lawyer in a corporate environment is for me, I find it really hard to \"care\" about big companies and their commercial interests. I do like law and do as much pro bono as I can at my current job, which I really enjoy. I have looked into jobs for lawyers at NGOs and am very daunted. The job descriptions largely seem to require 3-6 PQE in related practice area (as opposed to corporate) and the jobs, while being in London, pay no more than about 40k, which I think is objectively difficult to survive on\n\n#### Comment ID kvcj95l with +13 score by [(jk8528, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvcj95l/) (in reply to ID kvc5vf5):\nThe goal is to not care about the big company in the first place. From my perspective, very few people there actually care about the company and none of them are managers. The managers just try to convince to do things for “a greater good” so you put in free overtime and make them look good for their next promotion.\n\nIf you really do care about law, then go in house as others suggest, do the bits that you like on your contracted hours, and go home at 5 and switch off your phone / laptop.\n\nI made a career in a technical specialist field with a STEM background and caring about my employer (a big uk bank) and believing the corporate propaganda caused my burn out. Now I’m a consultant (because I like the work I did / do), earn more, stick to my contracted work time and am overall much happier. \n\nYes, I still suffer from post burn out, but I manage it a lot better and get back on track faster - by simply prioritising my needs over my employer’s or client’s needs. I guess your field is niche enough that skills and experience are hard to come by, so usually people involved can’t complain too hard as they don’t want to alienate you. \n\nAlso, once you set boundaries (especially at the beginning) and stick to them, people are forced to work around and accept it. I had been gaslighted in the past that I needed to prove myself every single day, but after some time realised that people earning more than me did less and sometimes even displayed their slacker attitude, but had no risk of getting fired. You’d be surprised how much of your experience was a result of you trying to be too pleasing to everyone. \n\nOne very last point of advice - go for some form of therapy. I for example tried CBT and al the insights I shared above my therapist brought out to me and really helped to start my mindset changed which (together with the job change and boundary setting) saved my sanity and my high earning job - as a matter of fact, I wasn’t HENRY when I was burnt out, but now am - with less stress.

You are in a mugs game. The hours, stress, nature of the work and utter uselessness of what you do will grind you down. However, you can leave! And you are in an awesome position, you've done a great slog, got the CV stuff and you will walk your next gig. I moved in house and did the industry rounds. If you still want to work the  corporate ladder and want to do variety of work this is the route for you. If you want to FIRE its locum work. This career choice gets a little taking used to as it's so unlike what the people that have trained you would do. But you take complete rein of your own life and get to quit and spend 6 months travelling wherever you want. Also you can work remotely, which means from any destination. If you care about freedom, have no major financial commitments and can live with the ego hit from peers, this one is for you. This is my current choice. \nOther alternatives could be taking a corporate role in the Arab world. Low tax more sun. \nNGO work is surprisingly stressful and you are up against people with higher PQE that don't care about the pay. The interesting work is at a very high PQE level and you will deskilling if you move now. It's a world of privilege in many ways (in my experience, 6 month at International NGO).\nI would advise stay in law and make a few different moves. Only then think about leaving.

So you’re doing an awful lot of graft with a lot of pressure being placed on you, but no real release valve for it.\n\nYou also tend to be one of the best levels to delegate to because 2-3 PQE is the sweet spot profitability wise.\n\nSo it’s a shitty time in private practice, but if you make it out the other side the job can become pretty fun again.\n\n## Comment ID kvbymk7 with +13 score by [(NormalMaverick, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvbymk7/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nI've often contemplated the same - I know someone who moved from being a strategy consultant in London to a schoolteacher in the North, and she seems happy with her choice.

E.g., instead of earning £140k in PE corporate law at an MC firm, working in-house somewhere for £80-90k.\n\nIt also comes down to you as a person. Would you be happy with a lower earning life, especially seeing your current peers go on to become partners etc.? At the same time, you would have your life to pursue hobbies, relationships, family, side hustles etc.\n\nAvoid making a rash decision because of how crap some days at work are.

I know the feeling. Mine got so bad I would walk to work and think of I got hit by a car or a bus at least I'd be in hospital and couldn't be contacted for a few days / weeks. It felt like there was no escape. \n\nLeaving that company was the best thing that I ever did. I took a job with less responsibility within the same industry and within a month I was no longer burnt out and I missed the responsibility I had. Within 6 months I was yearning for more and felt uninspired. \n\nMy point is, like many others have said, burnout needs tending to. If you can take time off, leave your job or be signed off, then you may find you love your job but it's the relentlessness of it that's having an impact. \n\nLeaving that job was the best thing I ever did. It was so toxic, the hours were insane and the management ground everyone to the floor. When I was in that place (partly due to the management and general nature of the business), it felt like there was no where to go. We were told our competitors were terrible and I felt like I couldn't do the type of work we did anywhere else. \n\nThat was a lie, and I'm better paid, happier and doing better work than I've ever done. If you feel like the company could be the issue - leave, join somewhere which is less intense and you can spend a year or two figuring out what you'd like to do less stressed and with more time to consider. I spent just under 2 years at a new company after I burnt out, and then I took a promotion, a 20% salary increase and now I'm back on my feet and absolutely loving work. \n\nBurnout is no joke. Take it seriously and if you're aware of it and posting about it on Reddit, you need to quit your job and give yourself time to recuperate. You'll be surprised how quickly you return to normal once you're out of the situation!\n\n## Comment ID kvbvm2c with +3 score by [(Menryn1924, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvbvm2c/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nI wasn't a million miles away from your situation, but I didn't walk away from law - just that job.\n\nIf you get a job in-house or at another firm (with a better balance) you can be conservative with the date you can start, and push your firm to either put you on gardening leave or let you leave after less than your full notice period.

Got to 4yrs PQE at MC firm in Corproate law, burnt out and hated it. Quit and after a few months off pivoted and went into teaching. Loved it but after 2-3yrs (and having my first kid) realised the problem was not the law - it was corporate law. \n\nI'm now 4 years into private client practice. During my LPC, wills/probate etc was only given a cursory look in - and naive me at the time thought \"God that sounds so boring\". But turns out I LOVE it. My corporate deals never excited me, could never find it in myself to be excited about my deals on the front page of the FT. Now my job is PEOPLE, and it is personal to them, and I feel like I can help at what can be really difficult times of their lives. It's also highly technical so intellectually stimulating.\n\nIt has its moments, but mostly the job is 9 - 5.30, and I go home and have time with my family (which never would have happened if I hadn't left the city). It's non-transactional and not court based so it's totally feasible to do part time (I do 4 days pw). Of course the pay is never going to be anything like corporate- but I have a life now and that is more than worth the reduction in pay. \n\nDon't regret teaching but part of me wished I had take more time to think and pivoted then by changing specialisms! Good luck!\n\n## Comment ID kvca2st with +2 score by [(ComplexOccam, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvca2st/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\n125k isa, 150k pension and a salary of 140k is lacklustre financials? \n\nThe rest of us are screwed then. \n\n\nMake the subtle change now in your life before burnout does a big one for you.\n\n### Comment ID kvcolk3 with +1 score by [(Sea_Ad5614, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvcolk3/) (in reply to ID kvca2st):\nI was thinking the same, I thought that was pretty excellent 🤣\n\n## Comment ID kvc10xc with +1 score by [(M_peeps, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvc10xc/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nIn house-benefits of stability and good pay whilst still 0900-1800?\n\n## Comment ID kvc7ti4 with +1 score by [(Old_Branch6343, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvc7ti4/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nHave you thought about sticking with PE but moving in-house?

You will undoubtedly have to take a pay cut but in house 2 PQE legal counsel can expect £110-150k base, with a bonus and generous carried interest/ shares schemes.

It is both a mental and physical thing.

I am a Dutch Lawyer with 25 years of experience. In general all jobs where you earn above average come at a price socially and mentally. Stress can come from many factors not in the least from colleagues. \n\nMost of my friends who have found being a Lawyer to stressful and demanding, became working teaching Law or working for the government in legal positions. I have found my first years as a Lawyer be the most stressful. Learning to manage clients and their  expectations is a full time job on its own. Win a case and the law has taken its rightious path, lose one and it is all your fault. You are almost always the bearer of bad news because others (clients) made a mess of things. \n\nThe change for me came the moment I superspecialized in two specific parts of my aready specific field (family law). So specializing in these two parts (alimony and i believe you call it prenups) allowed me a couple of things. The first is to say no to a lot of cases and keeping the better paid ones at a better hourly rate. It furthermore allowed me to be better than my opponents since I know more than 90% of the others of these parts of the field including most judges. \n\n. I combined this with putting a lot of work in the organisation of my practice (I try to be as much paperless as I can, the lawyerist website among others helped me a lot and I work on the other side of the globe). I have also taken a leap of faith by taking masterclass mediationcourses. Way out of my comfort zone. Not to be a mediator but to be a better lawyer. When I was not heard I used to make a louder statement again and again. Now I ask a different question or I look at someone to change the point of view. For instance if I want you to talk to the one sitting next to you instead of me, i look that person in the eye while you are talking to me. Little things but so important and overlooked. It makes you be in control and allows you to see through all the bullshit stories and let you take for instance the judge by the hand along your path. \n\nSo I guess I am saying knowledge is the key not only in your part of the law but also psychologicly. And I am saying you are asking the wrong question. There is not a part of the law easier or less stressful. There are things however which you can learn which making work as a Lawyer less stressful. But there are always times as a Lawyer you cannot help but to just get the work done properly (in the evening when you are tired, in the weekend when you just made other plans, on the day you already have another case). If you cannot take that, just be good at something else. \n\nAnd always remember to treat the people\nAround you in your personal life nice. They pay a price to. \n\nLots of luck and hapiness to You!

All sorts of very intrusive feeling annoying little settings as default. Firmware updates were very unstable to get installed to the keyboard through it.\n\nGuess grass is always greener on the other side.

I know they're just shallow bastions of capitalism.  But I feel like everything you buy online might be cheaper to buy, but it's also cheaply made and falls apart really fast so you have to keep rebuying it.  And for clothes in particular, I really prefer trying clothes on before I buy them.  I know if it doesn't fit or feel right, most places online offer free returns now.  But even if it's free to return, it's still a hassle that I'd prefer not to deal with.\n\nAnd they were such a big part of my youth.  As a kid, going to the mall was always a special treat.  Going to the toy store, the arcade, the food court, the movie theater, I loved all of it.  And even buying new clothes or shoes, my family didn't have a lot of money, so we didn't get new clothes that often.  So anytime we did, it was always something I looked forward to.  And then when I was a teenager, the mall was our default hangout place.  Rather than hanging out at someone's house, we'd always go to the mall when we had nothing else to do.   And it was a great way to meet people your age from other schools.  I wasn't the coolest kid in my school, so being able to meet new people who didn't know I wasn't one of the \"popular\" kids and could have a fresh start with was always exciting. I dated a whopping three girls in high school, and met all three of them at the mall.\n\n### Comment ID kxm4z6d with +11 score by [(GeetarEnthusiast85, Reddit, 2024-04-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Xennials/comments/1btfgvh/some_more_fond_memories_of_shopping_unlocked/kxm4z6d/) (in reply to ID kxlvnyb):\nDude, going to the mall was an EXPERIENCE!

Things have become really bad in the past six months. Leadership makes fake promises of improving things, but in the end, it only makes things worse for the people who do the work. A certain leader went on a listening tour and spoke for 23 minutes out of the 25 minutes allotted for listening to an employee. So you can imagine how much the leadership cares about its employees. One manager's modus operandi is to fire people on her team every few months. Good luck if you are on her team. Workload has increased, or in some cases, tripled, and pay has in fact decreased. Another leader claims that a certain task can be completed in 2 hours, whereas in reality it can take an entire week. Of course, that leader has never done any work at the ground level. Work gets dumped on you all the time!!",

Contract Automation is also used by dozens of prominent investment banks and offered through partnerships with AM Law 100 firms and service providers. The platform streamlines processes for a variety of M&A and private deal document types, including non-disclosure agreements, non-reliance letters, vendor contracts, and engagement letters, and continues to expand.\n\nDesigned to help private capital markets firms accelerate the negotiation of key contracts and dealmaking, Ontra's Contract Automation offers an end-to-end platform solution that is powered by industry-leading AI. It is an integral part of Ontra's Legal Operating System, purpose-built to automate legal workflows for the private investment industry.\n\nOntra first integrated AI capabilities into Contract Automation in 2016. Adding OpenAI's GPT-4 will allow Ontra to leverage its deep private markets expertise to accelerate expansion into more document types, and power several new and upcoming features to increase the speed of contract negotiations, including:\n\nDigital Playbooks: The digital source of truth for negotiation preferences to ensure seamless collaboration across legal and business teams with data-driven insights into positions' market alignment.\n\nMarkup Builder: AI-enabled markup tool that surfaces precedent, automates redlines, offers side-by-side document comparisons, and generates suggestions at the clause level that are aligned with a customer's digital playbook, substantially reducing editing time.\n\nAutomated Summaries: Fully automated, AI-generated summaries of key legal and business terms that can also accommodate additional customer-specific requests.\n\n\"Reaching our millionth document is an exciting milestone, and one that reflects the deep private markets legal experience embedded across our Legal Operating System,\" said Troy Pospisil, Ontra's CEO and founder. \"We've saved our customers countless hours to date, and on the heels of this achievement, we are excited to integrate additional AI capabilities that further Ontra's mission to accelerate routine contract negotiations, reduce friction in the dealmaking process, and expand to additional document types to save our customers even more time.\"\n\n\"One million contracts processed marks a historic moment for Ontra, and it's just the beginning,\" said Frank Giovinazzo, Ontra's GM of Contract Automation. \"Now, after a decade of handling routine contracts, integrating GPT-4's advanced capabilities means we can reach the next million exponentially faster and usher in a new era of contract management and collaboration.\"\n\nFor private investment firms, managing routine contract negotiations in-house stretches the limits of even the most talented and sophisticated legal teams, diverting attention from sourcing deals, managing investments, and operating the business. Contract Automation solves this challenge by combining an innovative and collaborative AI-powered software platform with a global network of highly trained legal professionals so teams can focus on strategic work.\n\n\"The ability to move efficiently is key to being competitive in private markets, and NDAs are a critical component of the investing process,\" said Jon Korngold, Global Head of Blackstone Growth. \"Ontra's AI-powered solution has helped us reduce significant friction in our processes — this has given our deal teams leverage so we can focus on conducting diligence, building deeper relationships with founders, and being a trusted partner during the next chapter of their growth journeys.\"\n\nFor more information about how Ontra transforms routine contracting for the private capital markets, visit www.ontra.ai.\n\nAbout Ontra\n\nOntra is the global leader in contract automation and intelligence for private capital markets firms.

      "# [Leading the charge: Law firms’ role in advancing AI in private equity by Ontra on 2024-06-13](https://www.ontra.ai/blog/law-firms-role-in-advancing-ai-in-private-equity/)\nAs outside counsel to private fund advisers, law firms are pivotal in driving the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) within the private equity (PE) industry. However, they face a unique dual challenge of incorporating AI into their own operations while also guiding PE clients through the implementation process.\n\nWhile AI adoption in the legal industry is still in its early stages, big law firms are already making significant strides by focusing on efficiency, cost reduction, and generating greater value for clients. By using AI to automate and streamline the most manual and routine parts of the law firm’s workload, lawyers are reclaiming valuable time for more strategic work.\n\nLaw firms are also a driving force in helping private fund advisers implement AI tools safely and confidently by understanding the technology’s benefits, risks, and regulatory landscapes for their clients.\n\nThis article explores how law firms can align their AI knowledge and adoption with their PE clients’ needs.\n\nThe AI adoption curve is ramping up at law firms\n\nIn Thomson Reuters’ 2023 Future of Professionals Report, 70% of the legal professionals surveyed said AI would have a transformative or high impact on the profession — more than the economy, regulations, or environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues.\n\nWhile many surveys and statistics show how law firms and in-house legal teams use AI, it’s impossible to settle on a realistic figure for their adoption rate. In all likelihood, adoption is currently similar to the customary tech adoption curve.\n\nThat’s not to say AI adoption will always follow a traditional bell curve. In 2023 and early 2024, many law firms were cognizant of the risks but willing to explore new AI vendors and tools. Experts believe that adoption will move swiftly as generative AI (GenAI) capabilities advance dramatically in weeks and months instead of years.\n\nIn another Thomson Reuters report, ChatGPT and Generative AI within Law Firms, Jason Adaska, Director of the Innovation Lab at U.S. law firm Holland & Hart, said: “The biggest delta I’ve seen is just people understanding that the realm of the possible has sort of shifted in a monumental way.” He added that this means GenAI education has become critical. “This is actually the most important thing for us, strategically the most important thing for the firm and our department, is to put resources out there.”\n\nIn another indication of AI’s growing importance, some BigLaw firms are now training summer associates on GenAI. Bloomberg Law reported that K&L Gates, Dechert, and Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe have all incorporated AI training into the 2024 summer associates class, which includes teaching them how to use AI research and chatbot tools.\n\n“That’s the whole idea about the training program: You need to teach people how this is going to impact the way they come to work,” Brendan McDonnell, a K&L Gates partner and member of the firm’s AI solutions group, told Bloomberg.\n\nWhy PE firms expect law firms to be trusted AI advisers\n\nAI’s transformative potential means a law firm’s AI strategy should align its services with its clients’ needs and strategies. For several reasons, private equity firms are looking for law firms to be strategic partners in adopting generative AI.\n\n1. Undeniable efficiency gains\n\nGenAI solutions can automate repetitive tasks like due diligence document review, speeding up deal processes and saving time for both lawyers and PE professionals. Many private fund advisers are feeling the pressure of heightened scrutiny from both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and limited partners (LPs). Meanwhile, operating costs are also rising, driving advisers to look for ways to maintain or cut spending.\n\nAI cannot replace experienced attorneys in providing complex legal services to PE clients, but it can serve as a valuable tool for augmenting legal professionals’ capabilities and improving overall efficiency.\n\nWhen law firms drill down, efficiency is a matter of speed and convenience for their clients. PE firms want their law firms to perform tasks faster and with less lift on their part. AI tools could enable law firms to reduce the turnaround times on routine, repetitive tasks while limiting the input they require from their clients.\n\n2. Greater value\n\nGiven how much private fund advisers invest in their relationships with outside counsel, advisers expect the firm to continuously provide value. The priority here is for the law firm to deliver value above what the AI tool offers. While AI will benefit clients by streamlining low-level tasks and reducing the law firm’s fees associated with those tasks, what new strategic work or expertise can the law firm provide to add value? For many lawyers, this is an exciting opportunity rather than a concern.\n\n3. Enhanced deal analysis and deeper insights\n\nAI tools can analyze vast amounts of data to identify potential risks and opportunities in deals that lawyers might miss. With a more comprehensive view of a deal, PE firms can make more informed investment decisions.\n\n4. Deliver differentiated value and a competitive advantage\n\nLaw firms that demonstrate expertise in AI are likely to be seen as more innovative and attractive partners by PE firms. By leveraging AI, law firms can offer PE firms a unique value proposition that goes beyond traditional legal services.\n\nAccording to Thomson Reuters’ 2023 Future of Professionals Report, 40% of legal respondents said their top goal for AI is to free them to focus on higher-level tasks — like structuring complex transactions, tax planning and structuring, and dispute resolution — ultimately delivering superior value to their clients by removing mundane tasks from the law firm’s workloads.\n\nFuture-proofing the practice: BigLaw’s approach to AI implementation\n\nWhile AI has tremendous potential for all law firms, BigLaw is where we’re already seeing significant moves in AI experimentation and implementation. Many global firms have developed specific practice groups dedicated to AI, technical innovation, and data analytics. Some firms have spent the last few years hiring data scientists and tech-savvy lawyers. A few have developed AI tools in-house with varying degrees of success\n\nAccording to a recent Thomson Reuters Report, Stepping into the future: How generative AI will help lawyers improve legal service delivery: “Some tasks will be automated, but the fundamental transformation will be how legal work is reimagined and improved. AI presents an enormous opportunity for legal because so much of what lawyers do today can be further enhanced with AI, and client outcomes can be improved.”\n\nWhile many large, global law firms see AI’s potential benefits, some concerns remain about accuracy, data privacy, and ethics. Overall, law firms are interested but still figuring out how GenAI can fit into their practices.\n\nGenAI tools aren’t performing legal analysis for clients, but they’re good at analyzing language to provide draft documents or answer questions. However, GenAI can’t fully interpret and apply the law to a client’s unique circumstances just yet.\n\nBecome a trusted AI adviser to clients\n\nWhatever AI strategy a law firm develops for itself, it’s also essential that the firm becomes a trusted adviser on AI for its clients. Private fund clients are looking to understand how AI works, what it is and isn’t good at, and if it’s trustworthy. Private funds often don’t have the internal bandwidth or expertise to navigate these questions on their own.\n\nBecoming a trusted adviser regarding AI takes considerable effort and time. The first step is to understand what AI tools are appropriate for private market firms. Thomson Reuters’ 2023 Future of Professionals Report noted that given law firms’ relationships with corporate clients, firms have a unique ability to ensure that businesses implement AI in a trusted way.\n\nAlso, pay close attention to the following:\n\nThe SEC’s proposed AI regulations\n\nThe Biden Administration’s AI-related executive orders and proposals\n\nThe American Bar Association’s guidance on AI use\n\nState bars’ and bar associations’ proposed or final rules on AI use\n\nWhat private equity firms want from law firms\n\nHere’s what PE firms want to see from their law firms regarding AI adoption:\n\n1. Understanding of AI applications\n\nLaw firms should clearly understand how AI can be applied to different aspects of the private equity deal process. PE firms expect law firms to invest in AI tools and train their lawyers on how to use them effectively. Law firms should be transparent about AI’s limitations and have lawyers with the expertise to interpret and validate its outputs.\n\n2. Identifying and evaluating AI tools\n\nDeveloping an internal knowledge base: Law firms are building expertise in AI tools relevant to private equity, like due diligence software, contract automation platforms, and legal research assistants. This allows them to advise clients on which tools best suit their specific needs and workflows.\n\nConducting pilot programs: Leading law firms should partner with AI vendors to pilot specific tools with select private equity clients. This allows them to assess the effectiveness, identify integration challenges, and provide valuable feedback to clients about the AI’s capabilities.\n\nCurating a trusted vendor network: Firms are compiling a list of reputable AI vendors offering solutions with proven track records in the private equity space to empower clients to make informed decisions without extensive independent research.\n\n3. Addressing data privacy & security\n\nSome fund managers are wary of AI using their proprietary and sensitive data or, even worse, somehow making it publicly available.\n\nDuring implementation, law firms should work to ensure any AI tool their lawyers or staff use doesn’t retain their clients’ proprietary, or sensitive information. Clients need their data to be safe and secure, and firms can assure them of that throughout the law firm’s digital transformation.\n\nWith any new AI tool a firm implements, leadership must be prepared to explain to clients how they’re protecting client data. Not only is this imperative to continuing the relationship, but it’s also a great way to help clients become more comfortable with the idea of adopting AI solutions internally and navigating the use of AI at their portfolio companies.\n\n4. Bolstering data management and quality assurance\n\nAdvising on data preparation: Law firms can guide clients on the importance of high-quality data training sets for AI tools. This ensures the accuracy and effectiveness of AI outputs for private equity tasks like due diligence or contract analysis.\n\nImplementing data governance policies: Law firms are developing data governance policies for managing client data used with AI tools to ensure data privacy, security, and compliance with relevant regulations. These can be shared with clients to help them establish their own policies.\n\nImplementing quality assurance checks: Firms are developing processes to assess the accuracy and reliability of AI outputs used in client work. This helps ensure legal teams don’t solely rely on AI results without verification.\n\n5. Sharing knowledge and thought leadership\n\nOrganizing AI-focused workshops: Law firms can host workshops or seminars for private equity clients to educate them on the benefits and applications of AI in their investment process.\n\nPublishing thought leadership content: Firms can publish articles, reports, or webinars showcasing how private equity clients can leverage AI for better outcomes.\n\nContributing to industry discussions: Firms should be participating in industry conferences or forums to position themselves as leaders in the conversation around AI integration for private equity success.\n\nChoosing wisely — not all AI tools are created equal\n\nBy taking these steps, big law firms are becoming valuable partners for private equity clients in their journey toward adopting and maximizing the benefits of AI tools.\n\nWhile many AI solutions are currently available, not all of them will accurately and efficiently address a private fund manager’s specific legal use cases. For example, a variety of contract management platforms use AI to streamline repetitive contract workflows. These platforms aren’t structured for private fund contracts, such as limited partnership agreements and side letters. Law firms and their PE clients are better off with a contract and obligation management solution built for their specific industry needs, or they’re unlikely to see a good return on investment.\n\nIn addition to having a good grasp of what’s available for PE clients, leading law firms can form strategic partnerships with the top AI providers. Whether formal or informal, a firm could generate value for clients by advising them on industry-specific AI tools and connecting them with trustworthy AI vendors.",

      "# [Ontra’s Insight, Powered By GPT by Ethan Beberness, Jennifer Petersen, Liz Dye, Steve Fretzin, Staci Zaretsky, Jordan Rothman, Source: Lawline CLE, Source: THOMSON, Source: Above The Law on 2024-01-25](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/ontras-insight-powered-by-gpt-4-simplifies-fund-management/)\nSince the initial release of OpenAI’s GPT large language model in 2022, developments in generative AI have transformed how the professional services industry conducts business, presenting new avenues for increasing efficiency and shifting workflows.\n\nOntra, the leader in AI-powered private markets contract automation and intelligence, has long leveraged machine learning and AI for its products, including its cutting-edge Insight product. Now, however, the company has added GPT-4 capabilities to the AI that powers Insight, taking Insight’s ability to help private markets professionals manage fund and side letter obligations and compliance to the next level.\n\nAbove the Law recently spoke with Ontra’s SVP of Engineering, Eric Hawkins to learn more about how integrating GPT-4 into the Insight product bolsters the already powerful tool.\n\nTransforming Contract Management in Private Markets With GPT-4\n\nTraditionally, private markets firms managed key documents on paper, in PDF form, and in antiquated filing systems. With Insight and its addition of GPT-4, however, private markets professionals can access a digital repository of their key fund documents and no longer need to search through those PDF documents individually to surface core terms and information, according to Hawkins.\n\n“Insight takes complex fund data and structures it in a way that makes it easy to find the answers to your questions, to compare provisions, to understand what you’ve agreed to, and what you have to comply with,” Hawkins explains.\n\n“It empowers multiple teams to work and collaborate more efficiently and bolster firm compliance in the face of increasing regulatory scrutiny.”\n\nPrivate markets professionals can search this structured repository of data, which includes limited partnership agreements, side letters, and other fund documents relevant to GPs’ obligations to investors, using the product’s SmartSearch feature. This feature empowers private markets professionals to quickly find and compare examples of past versions of a particular provision or agreement. Having that precedent on hand enables firms to negotiate better outcomes.\n\nDelivering Better, Faster Workflows\n\nInsight benefits private markets professionals by sorting and clustering the vast amount of data necessary for managing private funds. This allows not only for a single source of truth, but also for the development of better, more efficient workflows.\n\n“Insight consolidates all of that information across your fund docs and then lets you, as a private equity or legal professional helping private funds, have a more consolidated view of your obligations and commitments and build efficient workflows that keep you compliant,” Hawkins explains. “It lets you be efficient relative to the things you have to do for your LPs in particular.”\n\nThose better workflows can be built across multiple teams and can take into account variation between different versions of an agreement for different investors, Hawkins emphasizes.\n\nHe notes the ability to quickly pull up documents related to specific arrangements also allows private markets teams to stay agile during event-based occurrences that may trigger springing obligations. Additionally, he explains teams can integrate Insight into workflows relevant to every part of private fund management, from fundraising and MFN elections to ongoing investor and fund reporting and obligation management.\n\nHawkins also adds that teams can export data and reports from Insight, a feature he notes can be particularly helpful when asset managers prepare for mock and regular audits.\n\nAn AI Tool With A Human Touch\n\nUnlike many technology companies that utilize only AI for their main products, Ontra draws on the skills of a dedicated network of legal and private markets professionals — called “human-in-the-loop” experts — as an extra set of eyes to review the accuracy and relevancy of AI outputs.\n\nPrivate markets firms often begin by uploading fund documents via Insight to categorize and summarize the obligations contained therein. When this happens, as Hawkins explains, a specialist reviews and approves the obligations listed by Insight’s output, overriding, editing, or approving the suggestions as needed.\n\n“We basically take all of this structured data from Insight and put it in front of one of our trusted humans-in-the-loop, and they can very quickly review this and reduce the time it takes to digitize agreements,” adds Hawkins.\n\n“They can go through the whole document and can see the AI recommendations, then they can say ‘Yep, this looks right,’ or ‘This wasn’t quite right, let me touch it up a bit.’” he says. “Anybody can feed a document to ChatGPT, but storing and managing that data in a way that is useful to your firm is the magic that happens here.”\n\nHigh Speed, High Security\n\nWhen adopting any type of AI-based tool into day-to-day operations, security should be top of mind for any private markets firm.\n\nThe integration of GPT-4 into Insight was conducted with a focus on security.\n\n“None of the data we use to prompt OpenAI models will ever be used [by OpenAI] in subsequent training runs,” Hawkins states. “As a customer of OpenAI, Ontra was able to implement zero data retention for our customers, which means the basic data uploaded when a customer prompts GPT is immediately forgotten by OpenAI.”\n\nIn addition to the agreement between Ontra and OpenAI, Insight also adheres to the SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria for Security, a security framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to minimize the risk of data breaches.",

AI Search adds an interactive and conversational search experience to Insight’s purpose-built data architecture. Customers can now experience a new level of search accuracy, efficiency, and utility.\n\n“As customers have implemented AI internally, they’ve noticed that conventional AI solutions layered over unstructured documents yield unreliable search results and recommendations,” said Ontra General Manager of Insight, Miles Chan. “By contrast, AI Search leverages data inputs from documents that were meticulously structured by Synapse. This foundation of structured and validated data empowers customers to sort, search, and analyze complex legal agreements with confidence. Fund managers can go from a complex question to concrete action faster than ever before.”\n\nAs a next step, Synapse will enable customers to ask immediate follow-up questions and suggest related workflows based on requirements in their legal documents. Ontra will also extend these capabilities to its broader product suite, enabling users to gather critical knowledge from any contract faster.\n\nSynapse now allows Insight users to:\n\nAsk Insight questions about their agreements\n\nGet quick and actionable answers informed by the full scope of their agreements\n\nExplore supporting obligations with links to relevant reference text and summaries\n\nLeverage search results to create workflows that hold teams accountable\n\nLeading fund managers have signed up to take advantage of Ontra’s advanced AI technology to work smarter. These managers have identified the importance of all teams being able to quickly and easily understand an organization’s fund agreements. Whether a deal professional wants to confirm investment restrictions, investor relations needs a list of limited partners with co-investment rights, or accounting is calculating management fee breaks — all functions need to access information that allows them to take the next steps. With AI Search, any user can ask questions and quickly get the answers they need.\n\nAlso Read: Taking Advantage of Gen AI With Next-level Automation",

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ontra , the leading provider of AI-powered legal technology solutions for private capital investment firms, today announced the launch of automated Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) filing in Atlas, its AI-powered entity management solution. \"Private funds managers are telling us the CTA is one of their most pressing compliance concerns,\" said Ontra CEO and founder Troy Pospisil. \"Facilitating CTA compliance with manual workflows imposes additional resource and cost burdens at a time when firms must do more with less to maintain margins in a challenging operating environment.\" Automated CTA filing is the latest way Atlas supports fund managers in complying with beneficial ownership filing requirements: Organize and manage beneficial ownership information for all entities in an AI-enabled single source of truth Designate which entities require CTA filings and which are exempt Quickly reference key identity details required for reporting Make updates to beneficial ownership information that automatically apply across entities and structures Automate CTA filing with a single click Corporate Transparency Act compliance demands a scalable solution. The CTA's filing requirements for new entities took effect earlier this year, and on January 1, 2025, all pre-2024 non-exempt entities must file within 30 days of formation or a change in beneficial ownership. Noncompliance can result in steep penalties, including civil fines. With Atlas, Ontra's customers can manage CTA filings using fewer internal resources and less reliance on expensive outside counsel. Atlas is an AI-powered entity management solution purpose-built for private equity and asset managers. It uses automated workflows to help firms organize, manage, and share entity data, structure charts, and associated legal documents needed for managing a firm or fund.
