We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information is no longer personal data.\n\nFor example:\n\nWe may retain your payment data for as long as we need to process your purchase or subscription or as long as required for our compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nWe may retain sensitive personal information (such as your SSN or identification verification information) for as long as we need to provide you with the Services or as long as required for our compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nPersonal Data of Children\n\nAs noted in the Terms of Service, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data about children under 18 years of age; if you are a child under the age of 18, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any personal data. If we learn we have collected personal data from a child under 18 years of age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 18 years of age may have provided personal data to us, please contact us as described below.\n\nInternational Data Transfers\n\nAll information processed by us may be transferred, processed, and stored anywhere in the world, including, but not limited to, the United States or other countries, which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live. We endeavor to safeguard your information consistent with the requirements of applicable laws.\n\nAccessibility\n\nThis Privacy Policy uses industry-standard technologies and was developed in line with the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, version 2.1. If you wish to print this policy, please do so from your web browser. If you need further assistance regarding the accessibility of this webpage, please contact us as described below.\n\nUpdates to this Policy\n\nAs we continually work to improve our Services, we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time.

We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. However, we may offer different tiers of our Services as allowed by applicable data privacy laws (including the CCPA) with varying prices, rates or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of personal data that we receive from you.\n\nAuthorized Agents\n\nIf you are a California resident, you may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.\n\nSupplemental European Union and United Kingdom Notice\n\nEU and UK Residents\n\nIf you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom (“UK”), Lichtenstein, Norway or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU or UK General Data Protection Regulation (together, “GDPR”) with respect to your personal data, as outlined below.\n\nLawful Bases for Processing\n\nWe will only process your personal data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity and our “legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of others, as further described below.\n\nContractual Necessity: We process the following categories of personal data as a matter of “contractual necessity”, meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Service with you, which enables us to provide you with the Services. When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such personal data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require such data.\n\nProfile or contact information\n\nIdentifiers\n\nPayment data\n\nDevice/IP data\n\nOther personal data you choose to provide\n\nLegitimate Interest: We process the following categories of personal data when we believe it furthers the legitimate interest of us or third parties:\n\nProfile or contact information\n\nIdentifiers\n\nPayment Data\n\nDevice/IP data\n\nAnalytics data\n\nGeolocation Data\n\nOther personal data you choose to provide\n\nWe may also de-identify or anonymize personal data to further our legitimate interests\n\nExamples of these legitimate interests include (as described in more detail above):\n\nProviding, customizing, and improving the Services\n\nMarketing the Services\n\nCorresponding with you\n\nProvision of customer support\n\nProtecting from fraud or security threats\n\nMeeting legal requirements and enforcing legal terms\n\nCompleting corporate transactions\n\nConsent: In some cases and where required by law, we may collect or process personal data based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such data. When we process personal data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection.\n\nOther Processing Grounds: From time to time we may also need to process personal data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.\n\nTransfers of Personal Data\n\nThe Services are hosted and operated in the United States (“U.S.”) through Ontra and its service providers, and if you do not reside in the U.S., laws in the U.S. may differ from the laws where you reside. By using the Services, you acknowledge that any personal data about you, regardless of whether provided by you or obtained from a third party, is being provided to Ontra in the U.S. and will be hosted on U.S. servers, and you authorize Ontra to transfer, store and process your information to and in the U.S., and possibly other countries. In some circumstances, your personal data may be transferred to the U.S. pursuant to a data processing agreement incorporating standard data protection clauses.\n\nEU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework\n\nOntra complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively, “DPF”).\n\nOntra has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, including the principles of 1) notice, 2) choice, 3) accountability for onward transfer, 4) security, 5) data integrity and purpose limitation, 6) access, and 7) recourse, enforcement, and liability. Ontra has also certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.\n\nThe DPF Principles require that we remain potentially liable if any third party processing personal data on our behalf fails to comply with these DPF Principles (except to the extent we are not responsible for the event giving rise to any alleged damage). Ontra’s compliance with the DPF is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\n\nPlease contact us as described below with any questions or concerns relating to our DPF Certification. In compliance with the DPF, Ontra commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the DPF to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, you may also be entitled to invoke binding arbitration for complaints not resolved by other means.\n\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.

At the other end of the spectrum are the complex contract management systems that aren't  designed for contract review but try, like Ironclad --  (if you're in Europe, maybe Juro). Perhaps the best option for you: specialized and focused just on contract review, you would find a company like LegalOn. If you're in Europe, maybe something like Robin (although that is less AI and more about human support).\n\n## Comment ID k6fovon with +5 score by [(4vrf, Reddit, 2023-10-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaltech/comments/17ewo3q/legal_ai_what_have_you_used_reviews/k6fovon/) (in reply to ID 17ewo3q):\nThere is a chrome extension for research called [Counsel Companion](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/counsel-companion-researc/clclbbpdnecmfmlnfkmkjalaljfjhlpl).

From there I ask it theoretical claim questions like, “I had X happen to me and attempted to clarify it with merchant—no resolve was offered from X and I’m requesting a full refund.”  The AI program would respond with likelihoods for claim denials, citing articles within the T&C, or not (alluding to increased likelihood of claim approval).               Does something like this exist?                                          I just had a lackluster chargeback experience with Visa where they so easily could have warned me, as I made the claim, that it would very likely get denied and here’s why ______.  But no.                                          So that means it’s up to me (us)♥️\n\n## Comment ID kyw33m3 with +1 score by [(Realistic_Wolf_6446, Reddit, 2024-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaltech/comments/17ewo3q/legal_ai_what_have_you_used_reviews/kyw33m3/) (in reply to ID 17ewo3q):\nI'm using Pincites and the functionality is great, and they help you build out whatever playbooks you need to get started immediately.

They're scans, often compound documents (as in documents created at different times added together - a master with appendices and exhibits, or an amendment with schedules, toss in a few Work Orders in between things). As scans, they usually have random handwriting, artifacts, etc. As compound documents, they may have single column then double column, sometimes triple column, then it might switch to landscape orientation for printed spreadsheets tucked into the contract. I've found plenty of OCR that can address each item individually, but nothing that can correctly OCR the entire document. When the doc starts out single column then changes to double or triple column, most OCR ends up giving me single lines across (breaking the columns) which is useless.\nThe next issue is that contracts are stored as PDF, which, for text, means there are returns inserted at the end of each line (and they rarely correspond to the true end of a sentence.) As a result, I have to try to structure regex to look for phrases that may span a line, but I also need to capture the entire clause, which again proves quite difficult with end of line returns inserted throughout. Between the end of line returns and the OCR issues compound the complexity, since it generally means I can't rely on punctuation to be accurate (periods are often OCRd as commas, semicolons as commas, commas as periods, etc.)\n\nIf I have plain text, no OCR issues, and no odd returns throughout, I can handle things beautifully with regex. But the only way I get that is to manually fix the text.\n\n### Comment ID k9xs5r8 with +1 score by [(PLERoss, Reddit, 2023-11-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaltech/comments/17ewo3q/legal_ai_what_have_you_used_reviews/k9xs5r8/) (in reply to ID k9xp061):\nI’ve been looking too!

Now when I look at recruitment websites the number of those doc review jobs has dropped ~90%, and they often want someone who is fluent in a language like Russian or Arabic. Law firms are now using AI software like Ontra and GoogleDocAi for doc review. \n\nThis is just one sector, many others are facing this reality.\n\nI’m a huge proponent of AI, but the fear that a lot of people have towards AI is justified in my opinion. Many millions will lose their jobs.\n\n### Comment ID kr9zxzt with +3 score by [(observethebadgerking, Reddit, 2024-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1avcovg/i_dont_understand_ai_hatred_because_of_jobs_taken/kr9zxzt/) (in reply to ID kr9pk2g):\nThis is what I don't understand about the rapid rise of AI and why it has been allowed by the powers at be. Why would any government want advanced AI to replace people in work, leading to mass unemployment, and therefore a huge demand for state welfare and/or retraining in another field?

In that case, you would hate any AI that could automate just some part of your job. \n\nIt is also why every tech CEO is advocating for universal basic income, people would hate an AI that took away their way of living, but if someday you get fired because of an AI but you were told you would still get paid for doing nothing most people would love the AI. \n\nFun note its the same with the generative copy right debate, its not that artist have a good case against AI using their copyright material or for that sake really care about copy right. However making art and uploading it to deviant art so that some AI may train on it is not going to make any money, so most artist have to do commissions for clients in order to pay the bill, as far as I know all artist hate doing the commissions as they limit their creative freedom.  Yet they hate the fact that AI is now doing all the commission work because it is the only way they can make art and still pay the bills.\n\n### Comment ID kr9pxv4 with +2 score by [(gkas2k1, Reddit, 2024-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1avcovg/i_dont_understand_ai_hatred_because_of_jobs_taken/kr9pxv4/) (in reply to ID kr9pqvj):\n>People are not afraid AI will take their job, however people are really afraid of being unemployed in a society that  don't respect the unemployed.\n\nThat's a good point, the economy and society needs to be changed in accordance to progress of AI.\n\n#### Comment ID kr9xjau with +1 score by [(danyyyel, Reddit, 2024-02-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1avcovg/i_dont_understand_ai_hatred_because_of_jobs_taken/kr9xjau/) (in reply to ID kr9pxv4):\nAnd you think it will happen easily or ever.

We can’t even tax Starbucks properly! How will money taken from the exchequer to run basic services be found? Gov’ts have no plan for 90% unemployment. If there is UBI, what will it be? Will it be less than you currently earn? For a lot of ppl, yes. A lot of people like their jobs, it provides self worth, satisfaction and keeps them fit/mental engaged. This might be a whole new economic system we need to find yet no one has provided yet. \n\nAI will provide huge amounts of power to unelected companies and remove power from the ppl. Where do normal people get a say in things? Manipulation of the masses will be rife. Lack of trust also an issue as fact checking/truth finding might be impossible. \n\nMass surveillance on a level we have never seen. Control will follow. Everyday freedoms might disappear. \n\nA truly powerful AGI would run circles around us. Like the difference between us and our pets. Plus, even if we can control it, we can’t agree on values for alignment.

The problem is the transition phase, which we are starting. Now, we will probably see many lay offs and downsizing because of that reduction of human intervention, which means lifes affected. On the long run, however, it will hopefullu be positive and allow us to spend our time on what we decide instead of burning our lifes working. And, about money and so on, there are multiple options, and governmets should start working on making this transition phase smooth for societies (of course they won't do it until they can get some political benefit from it, which will be too late).

Do you have annual leave you can take? \n\nGet signed off for one month from your GP for burn out. Take some breathing space. You’ve worked very hard to get to where you are but your mental health is worth more than your income. Let yourself recover and have some space before deciding what to do next. I do acknowledge a month off for burn out in these firms would be very detrimental if you then decided you wanted to stay but resigning would also have the same impact. \n\nDo you like law? Can you imagine liking law? My husband is PQE6 with a great life balance working in house. Lower pay, and there are issues, but 4 day working week, weekends are his, no burn out. When in big firm he was overall more miserable with less life work balance. It might not be that law is the problem and that it’s the firm. You’ll drop salary but still have a good income for a nice life, particularly if you leave London.\n\n### Comment ID kvc5vf5 with +26 score by [(billbabybill, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvc5vf5/) (in reply to ID kvbtf3v):\nI am not convinced that being a lawyer in a corporate environment is for me, I find it really hard to \"care\" about big companies and their commercial interests.

From my perspective, very few people there actually care about the company and none of them are managers. The managers just try to convince to do things for “a greater good” so you put in free overtime and make them look good for their next promotion.\n\nIf you really do care about law, then go in house as others suggest, do the bits that you like on your contracted hours, and go home at 5 and switch off your phone / laptop.\n\nI made a career in a technical specialist field with a STEM background and caring about my employer (a big uk bank) and believing the corporate propaganda caused my burn out. Now I’m a consultant (because I like the work I did / do), earn more, stick to my contracted work time and am overall much happier. \n\nYes, I still suffer from post burn out, but I manage it a lot better and get back on track faster - by simply prioritising my needs over my employer’s or client’s needs. I guess your field is niche enough that skills and experience are hard to come by, so usually people involved can’t complain too hard as they don’t want to alienate you. \n\nAlso, once you set boundaries (especially at the beginning) and stick to them, people are forced to work around and accept it. I had been gaslighted in the past that I needed to prove myself every single day, but after some time realised that people earning more than me did less and sometimes even displayed their slacker attitude, but had no risk of getting fired. You’d be surprised how much of your experience was a result of you trying to be too pleasing to everyone. \n\nOne very last point of advice - go for some form of therapy. I for example tried CBT and al the insights I shared above my therapist brought out to me and really helped to start my mindset changed which (together with the job change and boundary setting) saved my sanity and my high earning job - as a matter of fact, I wasn’t HENRY when I was burnt out, but now am - with less stress. I relate as I come from a working family (did OU as well :) ) and it’s not worth sacrificing many years of high earning potential without trying different solutions first.\n\n#### Comment ID kvc9ht2 with +9 score by [(Kittykittycatcat1000, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvc9ht2/) (in reply to ID kvc5vf5):\nWhat about the civil service?

So you’re doing an awful lot of graft with a lot of pressure being placed on you, but no real release valve for it.\n\nYou also tend to be one of the best levels to delegate to because 2-3 PQE is the sweet spot profitability wise.\n\nSo it’s a shitty time in private practice, but if you make it out the other side the job can become pretty fun again.\n\n## Comment ID kvbymk7 with +13 score by [(NormalMaverick, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvbymk7/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nI've often contemplated the same - I know someone who moved from being a strategy consultant in London to a schoolteacher in the North, and she seems happy with her choice. She made a dramatic reduction (70%) reduction to her earnings though.\n\nBeing LENRY is not the only option for you though, there are roles which pay okay (I'm sure someone on Reddit can come up with a catchy name). E.g., instead of earning £140k in PE corporate law at an MC firm, working in-house somewhere for £80-90k.\n\nIt also comes down to you as a person. Would you be happy with a lower earning life, especially seeing your current peers go on to become partners etc.? At the same time, you would have your life to pursue hobbies, relationships, family, side hustles etc.\n\nAvoid making a rash decision because of how crap some days at work are. The sad reality of HENRY jobs is that you can leave any time, but coming back to them could be a slog.\n\nAlso, in case you aren't already, might be worth speaking to a mental health professional. Most good firms offer therapy, milk them for it.\n\n## Comment ID kvbt5k3 with +11 score by [(TouchTypical726, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvbt5k3/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nConsider leaving MC firm and going in house/smaller boutique firm.

I know the feeling. Mine got so bad I would walk to work and think of I got hit by a car or a bus at least I'd be in hospital and couldn't be contacted for a few days / weeks. It felt like there was no escape. \n\nLeaving that company was the best thing that I ever did. I took a job with less responsibility within the same industry and within a month I was no longer burnt out and I missed the responsibility I had. Within 6 months I was yearning for more and felt uninspired. \n\nMy point is, like many others have said, burnout needs tending to. If you can take time off, leave your job or be signed off, then you may find you love your job but it's the relentlessness of it that's having an impact. \n\nLeaving that job was the best thing I ever did. It was so toxic, the hours were insane and the management ground everyone to the floor. When I was in that place (partly due to the management and general nature of the business), it felt like there was no where to go. We were told our competitors were terrible and I felt like I couldn't do the type of work we did anywhere else. \n\nThat was a lie, and I'm better paid, happier and doing better work than I've ever done. If you feel like the company could be the issue - leave, join somewhere which is less intense and you can spend a year or two figuring out what you'd like to do less stressed and with more time to consider. I spent just under 2 years at a new company after I burnt out, and then I took a promotion, a 20% salary increase and now I'm back on my feet and absolutely loving work. \n\nBurnout is no joke. Take it seriously and if you're aware of it and posting about it on Reddit, you need to quit your job and give yourself time to recuperate. You'll be surprised how quickly you return to normal once you're out of the situation!\n\n## Comment ID kvbvm2c with +3 score by [(Menryn1924, Reddit, 2024-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvbvm2c/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nI wasn't a million miles away from your situation, but I didn't walk away from law - just that job.\n\nIf you get a job in-house or at another firm (with a better balance) you can be conservative with the date you can start, and push your firm to either put you on gardening leave or let you leave after less than your full notice period.

Got to 4yrs PQE at MC firm in Corproate law, burnt out and hated it. Quit and after a few months off pivoted and went into teaching.

During my LPC, wills/probate etc was only given a cursory look in - and naive me at the time thought \"God that sounds so boring\". But turns out I LOVE it. My corporate deals never excited me, could never find it in myself to be excited about my deals on the front page of the FT. Now my job is PEOPLE, and it is personal to them, and I feel like I can help at what can be really difficult times of their lives.

It's non-transactional and not court based so it's totally feasible to do part time (I do 4 days pw).

I work in biotech / pharma and the general counsel seem to have a much better time, they are closely involved with the company's strategy so it's intellectually interesting work, but they don't have to sell their time. I would think work-life balance would be fairly good.\n\n## Comment ID kve3wbw with +1 score by [(RagerRambo, Reddit, 2024-03-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kve3wbw/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nThis burnout coupled with paying ever higher income tax is the reason why I'll retire early, or move abroad\n\n## Comment ID kvea7rz with +1 score by [(ScottishSpartacus, Reddit, 2024-03-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvea7rz/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nHaven’t got advice about a career to transition to, but, my high earning ex spent about three years in her current role before being burnt out. She then took a 3 month sabbatical, and returned to work, has been able to reduce her hours, now being 4 days a week. If she has to work on the fifth day, she now gets overtime. Don’t think she actually took a pay cut, probably didn’t get a ride at that time though.

It’s tough when you’re tired and burnt out but I tend to catastrophise when in that position. Can you make some small changes? Can you move to some slightly less stressful work within your current role? Take a holiday? If you need to move job can you move to a similar role where there is less stress? Also don’t feel like you’ve failed. You’re doing exceptionally well! You are off to a great start and still young and you’ve recognised what’s important to you.

Yes, you have a good job, and pays you well but there are so many companies like that out there. They are not precious, your mind is, that's what makes you the money - so you need to protect it!   Second decide if it's the firm / sector or the job itself you don't like - might be better to work in another potentially low paying job to suss it out.  I was burnt out years back and wanted to leave everything and train as a teacher, however found a similar job in a different sector  - been very happy!  Maybe start interviewing and see how you feel.   Third, you should be able to get a mortgage in principle before leaving in case you wanted to buy a house and the next low paying job doesn't give you enough loan power ( also consider the probation period ).\n\n## Comment ID kvfuyis with +1 score by [(trbd003, Reddit, 2024-03-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1bh6klb/henry_going_to_lenry/kvfuyis/) (in reply to ID 1bh6klb):\nCould you take some time out - either as a formal sabbatical from your job or just leave without having a job to go to? Take some time to travel or pursue an interest.\n\nPerhaps perched on a mountainside in Asia after several weeks of genuine, deep rest; you might be in a better position to reflect on what you're really looking for. Right now I think you'd romanticise the idea of working in McDonald's, just to give yourself a break.\n\nTaking a break doesn't have to mean giving up everything you've earned yourself.

If all of the bases pop up at the same time, it's the old style of map with 3 (or rarely 4) bases plus airfield. If they pop up one at a time, then they're the infinitely respawning bases with more HP. You can also check the mission objectives in the map screen and see if it mentions bombing the airfield, or check on the bottom left of the screen to see if it has a counter of ground targets to destroy (old style will show a set number, new ones don't. Old ones only counted specific ground targets, mostly pillboxes and tanks, while the new one will count any ground kill towards ticket bleed).\n\nWhile the new style does bleed some tickets if you take out a base, you better make sure you can take it out in a single run or else it might respawn before you can return to base and rearm. If that's the case, it might be better to just bomb the ground targets.\n\n#### Comment ID jbey231 with +1 score by [(Whyam_special923, Reddit, 2023-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/11lo2d6/public_service_announcement_bombers_are_now/jbey231/) (in reply to ID jbdvmvt):\nI remember when the F.222 bullied 1.3-1.7 it was fun\n\n### Comment ID jbe3s5u with +7 score by [(Tokkirie, Reddit, 2023-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/11lo2d6/public_service_announcement_bombers_are_now/jbe3s5u/) (in reply to ID jbdjrje):\nJu 288 C: **\"Please allow me to introduce myself!\"**\n\n#### Comment ID jbeozor with +4 score by [(ksheep, Reddit, 2023-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/11lo2d6/public_service_announcement_bombers_are_now/jbeozor/) (in reply to ID jbe3s5u):\nNothing quite like seeing a 3-4 man squad of Ju 288s or BV 238s take out all the bases and airfield before the fighters could get off the ground and climb to altitude.

I had at least a couple matches where nobody got a single kill because the bombers ended the game so quickly.\n\nGranted with the change to add respawning bases Gaijin probably swung things too far the other way, so now it's nearly impossible for bombers to significantly help win the match (outside of causing about the same ticket bleed as taking out 5 ground targets), so now they are only the deciding factor if there's one enemy left that decides to space-climb, leaving the other team to just ground-pound until the tickets run out.\n\n### Comment ID jbdzpzi with +7 score by [(Kraujotaka, Reddit, 2023-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/11lo2d6/public_service_announcement_bombers_are_now/jbdzpzi/) (in reply to ID jbdjrje):\nThat's only because game modes are ALL trash tier, blame the Devs/gaijin for their incompetence not the player.\n\n#### Comment ID jbe3r45 with +8 score by [(d_Inside, Reddit, 2023-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/11lo2d6/public_service_announcement_bombers_are_now/jbe3r45/) (in reply to ID jbdzpzi):\nIf you took time to read my comment to the end you’d have noticed that this is exactly what I’m saying.\n\n### Comment ID jbe7nvt with +1 score by [(Always-Panic, Reddit, 2023-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/11lo2d6/public_service_announcement_bombers_are_now/jbe7nvt/) (in reply to ID jbdjrje):\nDoesn't hitting bases lower the enemy's team score like in prop battles?\n\n#### Comment ID jbe8qiu with +2 score by [(d_Inside, Reddit, 2023-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/11lo2d6/public_service_announcement_bombers_are_now/jbe8qiu/) (in reply to ID jbe7nvt):\nYes, but it’s barely effective.

Most of my relatives during WWII were either bomber pilots or gunners. My father was ground crew on a bomber base during the cold war. Bombers have a special place in my heart, and it sucks to see them being neglected in War Thunder. Maybe I'm being stupid by saying this, but having only three bombers on one team, taking care of multiple bases at once doesn't encourage teamwork. The bombers split up to bomb their own base, and in doing so make them extremely vulnerable. There is a reason why bombers fly in formations. Nothing is more vulnerable than a lone bombers. \n\nI'm not sure what the solution is, I'm not smart enough to come up with one.

Things have become really bad in the past six months. Leadership makes fake promises of improving things, but in the end, it only makes things worse for the people who do the work. A certain leader went on a listening tour and spoke for 23 minutes out of the 25 minutes allotted for listening to an employee. So you can imagine how much the leadership cares about its employees. One manager's modus operandi is to fire people on her team every few months. Good luck if you are on her team. Workload has increased, or in some cases, tripled, and pay has in fact decreased. Another leader claims that a certain task can be completed in 2 hours, whereas in reality it can take an entire week. Of course, that leader has never done any work at the ground level. Work gets dumped on you all the time!!",

          "cons": "It becomes apparent early on that transparency and fairness, which were promised upfront, are nothing but empty words. Despite being quoted a specific compensation upon accepting the position, the actual earnings fell far short, and there was no effort to rectify this discrepancy. The disparity in salaries between employees at different levels, even when their job responsibilities are identical, is a major concern. The company avoids addressing these glaring discrepancies and crucial employee questions, such as the absence of a 401k match, during company-wide meetings. Management's response to salary adjustments has been nothing short of a constant stream of excuses. Despite initial claims that salaries were \"above market\" or competitive, these assertions fail to acknowledge the impact of inflation over time. What might have seemed like a favorable salary upon joining the company loses its advantage as the cost of living increases. In reality, employees are now faced with a disheartening choice, realizing that despite the excuses provided, they are effectively experiencing a salary reduction of over 10% due to the soaring cost of living. On top of the favoritism and broken promises, another disillusioning aspect of working at this company was the current lack of promotion opportunities. During the hiring process, they boasted about a high likelihood of upward mobility within a year, creating a sense of optimism among new employees. However, as time went on, it became evident that these promises were nothing more than empty assurances. The path to advancement has been riddled with obstacles. The lack of career growth opportunities and the feeling of being stuck in the same role for an extended period has added to the growing dissatisfaction with the company's management and their lack of commitment to their own promises. The most significant problem within this company is the rampant favoritism displayed by higher-ups. The issue of favoritism extends to the leadership team, where it is evident that many members of the c-suite surround themselves with friends. Consequently, any problems or concerns are either ignored or inadequately addressed, further contributing to a toxic work environment. Attempts to raise concerns to people partners about favoritism or any other issues proved futile, as they merely took note of the problem without offering any resolution. The lack of accountability and disregard for employee feedback further exacerbated the discontent. One incident that particularly highlighted the lack of accountability within the company was when a leader used a slur during a weekly team meeting. The company took an unreasonably long time to issue an apology, which, when it finally came, felt insincere and failed to hold the leader accountable for their behavior.",

The leadership has been particularly impressive in this difficult macroeconomic season. While many other startups have had to resort to layoffs, Ontra leadership has been able to continue to drive growth and maintain planned cash burn while not laying off a single person.

Everyone genuinely cares about each other and helping their teams succeed. We function as a true collaborative team. Not to mention, whenever I need help or am uncertain of something either my manager, leadership, or the people team have been happy to take the time to support.\n\nOntra truly feels like a place I can grow and build a long term career at. \n\nThe last thing I want to mention is how nice it is that senior leadership connects with all levels of employees.

Recent leadership adds show that there is a willingness to bring in new thinking and a desire to build best practices. We are big enough that you can focus on and develop in your area of expertise, but small enough that anyone can bring ideas to the table and make a difference. We have also embraced being fully remote which means I get to shift what used to be commute time into family time. In order to do this well, the company has put in a lot of support structures to ensure that we have the tools be successful + appropriate opportunities to meet up with and work alongside each other in person. It feels like the best of both worlds at a time when a lot of orgs are still struggling to figure it out.",

Despite being quoted a specific compensation upon accepting the position, the actual earnings fell far short, and there was no effort to rectify this discrepancy. The disparity in salaries between employees at different levels, even when their job responsibilities are identical, is a major concern. The company avoids addressing these glaring discrepancies and crucial employee questions, such as the absence of a 401k match, during company-wide meetings. Management's response to salary adjustments has been nothing short of a constant stream of excuses. Despite initial claims that salaries were \"above market\" or competitive, these assertions fail to acknowledge the impact of inflation over time. What might have seemed like a favorable salary upon joining the company loses its advantage as the cost of living increases. In reality, employees are now faced with a disheartening choice, realizing that despite the excuses provided, they are effectively experiencing a salary reduction of over 10% due to the soaring cost of living. On top of the favoritism and broken promises, another disillusioning aspect of working at this company was the current lack of promotion opportunities. During the hiring process, they boasted about a high likelihood of upward mobility within a year, creating a sense of optimism among new employees. However, as time went on, it became evident that these promises were nothing more than empty assurances. The path to advancement has been riddled with obstacles. The lack of career growth opportunities and the feeling of being stuck in the same role for an extended period has added to the growing dissatisfaction with the company's management and their lack of commitment to their own promises. The most significant problem within this company is the rampant favoritism displayed by higher-ups. The issue of favoritism extends to the leadership team, where it is evident that many members of the c-suite surround themselves with friends. Consequently, any problems or concerns are either ignored or inadequately addressed, further contributing to a toxic work environment. Attempts to raise concerns to people partners about favoritism or any other issues proved futile, as they merely took note of the problem without offering any resolution. The lack of accountability and disregard for employee feedback further exacerbated the discontent. One incident that particularly highlighted the lack of accountability within the company was when a leader used a slur during a weekly team meeting. The company took an unreasonably long time to issue an apology, which, when it finally came, felt insincere and failed to hold the leader accountable for their behavior.",

Another leader claims that a certain task can be completed in 2 hours, whereas in reality it can take an entire week. Of course, that leader has never done any work at the ground level.

      "# [Ontra Celebrates One Million Documents; Adds GPT-4 to Industry-Leading Contract Automation Platform on 2024-02-06](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ontra-celebrates-one-million-documents-adds-gpt-4-to-industry-leading-contract-automation-platform-302053651.html)\nOntra leverages million-contract expertise and new AI integrations to supercharge private markets contract negotiation and collaboration.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ontra, the leader in AI-powered contract automation and intelligence, today celebrated its milestone achievement of processing over one million contracts for its customers, while concurrently announcing new GPT-4 enhancements to its Contract Automation platform.\n\nSince its launch in 2014, Ontra's Contract Automation platform has helped more than a thousand global private markets firms, including 9 of the top 10 PEI-ranked investment firms and nearly 50% of the PEI 300, negotiate routine contracts across a broad range of private capital investment strategies. Contract Automation is also used by dozens of prominent investment banks and offered through partnerships with AM Law 100 firms and service providers. The platform streamlines processes for a variety of M&A and private deal document types, including non-disclosure agreements, non-reliance letters, vendor contracts, and engagement letters, and continues to expand.\n\nDesigned to help private capital markets firms accelerate the negotiation of key contracts and dealmaking, Ontra's Contract Automation offers an end-to-end platform solution that is powered by industry-leading AI. It is an integral part of Ontra's Legal Operating System, purpose-built to automate legal workflows for the private investment industry.\n\nOntra first integrated AI capabilities into Contract Automation in 2016. Adding OpenAI's GPT-4 will allow Ontra to leverage its deep private markets expertise to accelerate expansion into more document types, and power several new and upcoming features to increase the speed of contract negotiations, including:\n\nDigital Playbooks: The digital source of truth for negotiation preferences to ensure seamless collaboration across legal and business teams with data-driven insights into positions' market alignment.\n\nMarkup Builder: AI-enabled markup tool that surfaces precedent, automates redlines, offers side-by-side document comparisons, and generates suggestions at the clause level that are aligned with a customer's digital playbook, substantially reducing editing time.\n\nAutomated Summaries: Fully automated, AI-generated summaries of key legal and business terms that can also accommodate additional customer-specific requests.\n\n\"Reaching our millionth document is an exciting milestone, and one that reflects the deep private markets legal experience embedded across our Legal Operating System,\" said Troy Pospisil, Ontra's CEO and founder. \"We've saved our customers countless hours to date, and on the heels of this achievement, we are excited to integrate additional AI capabilities that further Ontra's mission to accelerate routine contract negotiations, reduce friction in the dealmaking process, and expand to additional document types to save our customers even more time.\"\n\n\"One million contracts processed marks a historic moment for Ontra, and it's just the beginning,\" said Frank Giovinazzo, Ontra's GM of Contract Automation. \"Now, after a decade of handling routine contracts, integrating GPT-4's advanced capabilities means we can reach the next million exponentially faster and usher in a new era of contract management and collaboration.\"\n\nFor private investment firms, managing routine contract negotiations in-house stretches the limits of even the most talented and sophisticated legal teams, diverting attention from sourcing deals, managing investments, and operating the business. Contract Automation solves this challenge by combining an innovative and collaborative AI-powered software platform with a global network of highly trained legal professionals so teams can focus on strategic work.\n\n\"The ability to move efficiently is key to being competitive in private markets, and NDAs are a critical component of the investing process,\" said Jon Korngold, Global Head of Blackstone Growth. \"Ontra's AI-powered solution has helped us reduce significant friction in our processes — this has given our deal teams leverage so we can focus on conducting diligence, building deeper relationships with founders, and being a trusted partner during the next chapter of their growth journeys.\"\n\nFor more information about how Ontra transforms routine contracting for the private capital markets, visit www.ontra.ai.\n\nAbout Ontra\n\nOntra is the global leader in contract automation and intelligence for private capital markets firms.

      "# [Ontra Pioneers AI Search for Complex Legal Agreements by PR Newswire on 2024-10-08](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ontra-pioneers-ai-search-complex-120000655.html)\nThe new search functionality surfaces and summarizes key knowledge stored in agreements so fund managers can answer questions and perform tasks more efficiently.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today Ontra, the leader in contract automation and intelligence for the private markets, announced that its search capabilities are getting a major boost from its powerful AI engine, Synapse. Now fund managers have the ability to ask questions of their agreements and get actionable answers in seconds. Ontra's customers can save time and money by using AI Search to quickly and accurately surface knowledge hidden in their most complex legal agreements, including LPAs and side letters.\n\nWith this functionality, Ontra builds upon its AI contract digitization capabilities released earlier this year, which enable its Insight platform to identify and categorize the information in fund documents faster and more cost-effectively than ever before. AI Search adds an interactive and conversational search experience to Insight's purpose-built data architecture. Customers can now experience a new level of search accuracy, efficiency, and utility.\n\n\"As customers have implemented AI internally, they've noticed that conventional AI solutions layered over unstructured documents yield unreliable search results and recommendations,\" said Ontra General Manager of Insight, Miles Chan. \"By contrast, AI Search leverages data inputs from documents that were meticulously structured by Synapse. This foundation of structured and validated data empowers customers to sort, search, and analyze complex legal agreements with confidence. Fund managers can go from a complex question to concrete action faster than ever before.\"\n\nAs a next step, Synapse will enable customers to ask immediate follow-up questions and suggest related workflows based on requirements in their legal documents. Ontra will also extend these capabilities to its broader product suite, enabling users to gather critical knowledge from any contract faster.\n\nSynapse now allows Insight users to:\n\nAsk Insight questions about their agreements\n\nGet quick and actionable answers informed by the full scope of their agreements\n\nExplore supporting obligations with links to relevant reference text and summaries\n\nLeverage search results to create workflows that hold teams accountable\n\nLeading fund managers have signed up to take advantage of Ontra's advanced AI technology to work smarter. These managers have identified the importance of all teams being able to quickly and easily understand an organization's fund agreements.

      "# [Featured Founders: AlexAnndra and James Ontra of Shufflrr – Embarc Collective](https://embarccollective.com/featured-founders-alexanndra-and-james-ontra-of-shufflrr/)\nWhat were you doing previously and what inspired you to launch your company?\n\nPresentations. Over the years, AlexAnndra and I have delivered ad sales presentation systems for ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, NFL, NBA, IBM (3 letter acronyms to keep it short), and even exhibits in Epcot Center. While working for these A+ presenters, similar needs and functions emerged and coalesced into a strategy called “Presentation Management.” To answer “Why did we launch Shufflrr?”, it would be to make it easy for any enterprise to implement this new communication strategy we call “Presentation Management.”\n\nWhat pain point is your company solving? What gets you excited to go to work every day?\n\nPresentations are a mess. On an enterprise level, there is no consistency: not of brand, not of message, and not of compliance. On top of that, salespeople waste hours and hours assembling each slide show. This multiplied by the number of people presenting in your company. Shufflrr cleans up this mess and streamlines the process.\n\nName the biggest challenge you faced in the process of launching the company. How did you overcome it?\n\nEvery challenge you face in launching a company is critical. Every step, or misstep, can throw you off course. But the single biggest challenge for Shufflrr would be knowledge. Knowledge in the c-suite that Presentation Management exists. Knowledge that Presentation Management saves time across the enterprise, that it ensures brand and content compliance, and that it achieves harmony with their people singing from the same set of slides.\n\nWhere do you see your company headed next?\n\nJust as Amazon is retail, eBay is auctions, Salesforce is CRM, Shufflrr is Presentation Management. We are creating the category and at the same time leading it with the technology solution. Shufflrr owns Presentation Management.\n\nGive us a tactical piece of advice that you’d share with another founder just starting out.\n\nDo it. Put action behind your thoughts. Make that prototype. Write that code. Investigate who might buy it. You never know what will happen. I know all of this sounds a bit cliché, but until there is action, it is only a dream.\n\nWhy Tampa Bay?\n\nEmbarc Collective and the fertile technology ecosystem it supports. Additionally, Tampa has a low cost of living, an incredible talent pool, and a winning attitude that continually earns the nickname “Champa Bay.” Shufflrr is proud to be here.",

      "# [Ontra’s Insight, Powered By GPT by Ethan Beberness, Jennifer Petersen, Jeremy Barker, Jordan Rothman, Source: THOMSON, Source: Above The Law, Source: Associate Center on 2024-01-25](https://abovethelaw.com/2024/01/ontras-insight-powered-by-gpt-4-simplifies-fund-management/)\nSince the initial release of OpenAI’s GPT large language model in 2022, developments in generative AI have transformed how the professional services industry conducts business, presenting new avenues for increasing efficiency and shifting workflows.\n\nOntra, the leader in AI-powered private markets contract automation and intelligence, has long leveraged machine learning and AI for its products, including its cutting-edge Insight product. Now, however, the company has added GPT-4 capabilities to the AI that powers Insight, taking Insight’s ability to help private markets professionals manage fund and side letter obligations and compliance to the next level.\n\nAbove the Law recently spoke with Ontra’s SVP of Engineering, Eric Hawkins to learn more about how integrating GPT-4 into the Insight product bolsters the already powerful tool.\n\nTransforming Contract Management in Private Markets With GPT-4\n\nTraditionally, private markets firms managed key documents on paper, in PDF form, and in antiquated filing systems. With Insight and its addition of GPT-4, however, private markets professionals can access a digital repository of their key fund documents and no longer need to search through those PDF documents individually to surface core terms and information, according to Hawkins.\n\n“Insight takes complex fund data and structures it in a way that makes it easy to find the answers to your questions, to compare provisions, to understand what you’ve agreed to, and what you have to comply with,” Hawkins explains.\n\n“It empowers multiple teams to work and collaborate more efficiently and bolster firm compliance in the face of increasing regulatory scrutiny.”\n\nPrivate markets professionals can search this structured repository of data, which includes limited partnership agreements, side letters, and other fund documents relevant to GPs’ obligations to investors, using the product’s SmartSearch feature. This feature empowers private markets professionals to quickly find and compare examples of past versions of a particular provision or agreement. Having that precedent on hand enables firms to negotiate better outcomes.\n\nDelivering Better, Faster Workflows\n\nInsight benefits private markets professionals by sorting and clustering the vast amount of data necessary for managing private funds. This allows not only for a single source of truth, but also for the development of better, more efficient workflows.\n\n“Insight consolidates all of that information across your fund docs and then lets you, as a private equity or legal professional helping private funds, have a more consolidated view of your obligations and commitments and build efficient workflows that keep you compliant,” Hawkins explains. “It lets you be efficient relative to the things you have to do for your LPs in particular.”\n\nThose better workflows can be built across multiple teams and can take into account variation between different versions of an agreement for different investors, Hawkins emphasizes.\n\nHe notes the ability to quickly pull up documents related to specific arrangements also allows private markets teams to stay agile during event-based occurrences that may trigger springing obligations. Additionally, he explains teams can integrate Insight into workflows relevant to every part of private fund management, from fundraising and MFN elections to ongoing investor and fund reporting and obligation management.\n\nHawkins also adds that teams can export data and reports from Insight, a feature he notes can be particularly helpful when asset managers prepare for mock and regular audits.\n\nAn AI Tool With A Human Touch\n\nUnlike many technology companies that utilize only AI for their main products, Ontra draws on the skills of a dedicated network of legal and private markets professionals — called “human-in-the-loop” experts — as an extra set of eyes to review the accuracy and relevancy of AI outputs.\n\nPrivate markets firms often begin by uploading fund documents via Insight to categorize and summarize the obligations contained therein. When this happens, as Hawkins explains, a specialist reviews and approves the obligations listed by Insight’s output, overriding, editing, or approving the suggestions as needed.\n\n“We basically take all of this structured data from Insight and put it in front of one of our trusted humans-in-the-loop, and they can very quickly review this and reduce the time it takes to digitize agreements,” adds Hawkins.\n\n“They can go through the whole document and can see the AI recommendations, then they can say ‘Yep, this looks right,’ or ‘This wasn’t quite right, let me touch it up a bit.’” he says. “Anybody can feed a document to ChatGPT, but storing and managing that data in a way that is useful to your firm is the magic that happens here.”\n\nHigh Speed, High Security\n\nWhen adopting any type of AI-based tool into day-to-day operations, security should be top of mind for any private markets firm.\n\nThe integration of GPT-4 into Insight was conducted with a focus on security.\n\n“None of the data we use to prompt OpenAI models will ever be used [by OpenAI] in subsequent training runs,” Hawkins states. “As a customer of OpenAI, Ontra was able to implement zero data retention for our customers, which means the basic data uploaded when a customer prompts GPT is immediately forgotten by OpenAI.”\n\nIn addition to the agreement between Ontra and OpenAI, Insight also adheres to the SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria for Security, a security framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to minimize the risk of data breaches.",

The technology works with legal‐specific DMS providers and general enterprise content management systems and is language agnostic, it says.\n\n“We see this union with LexisNexis as an extension of our drafting vision to proactively surface valuable and strategic insights for customers – delivering a center of knowledge to legal teams,” said Henchman cofounder Gilles Mattelin. “We believe the combination of our teams and tech will empower customers to make informed decisions faster, generate outstanding work, and drive economic value for their organizations.”\n\nFounded in 2020, Henchman says it has more than 170 legal and corporate customers globally.\n\nIt was a finalist in this year’s Startup Alley at ABA Techshow, which I oversee.\n\nThe deal is expected to close early in the second half of 2024, LexisNexis said.",
