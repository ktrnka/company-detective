He wasn’t a football guy (more of a basketball fan) but he bought the Seahawks so they wouldn’t leave Seattle. He bought and kept open a lotta local little historical places like a computer museum and the cinerama. He also had a very hands on approach to the Seahawks where the community trusted his leadership. He definitely had points of conflict with the community, people either loved or hated his Seattle Commons idea to build a Central Park using the cities money but his land (people thought he should fund it himself and pointed out he was developing all the surrounding land) and his rich neighbors got annoyed the way he treated Lake Washington as his own personal pond (tho the stories are just funny to everyone else). However, ultimately Paul’s behavior made him someone people looked up to and that’s not the same for Jody.

I abhor any Chiefs fan that dons a Tyreek jersey because he hit a pregnant woman…and that organization still allows him to suit up and play in front of tens of thousands cheering fans all because he can run fast? Cool. So as long as your are productive than, you can hit whomever you want if you are a Chief. But that’s not fair to the whole fan base because I’m sure there are a ton of people (going out on a limb here for humanity sake) who don’t support Tyreek for being able to play too. \n\nAre KC fans wrong for cheering their team on or it is possible, just maybe, to like the team as a whole and simultaneously despise individuals? Are Patriot fans not allowed to cheer on their team because Kraft got a handy in a massage parlor?

I don’t want to do that for deshaun Watson. \n\nIf I was making a moral stance I wouldn’t watch the NFL. it’s way too problematic of a league. But that’s not my issue with Watson. My issue with Watson is I find what he’s done to be too far for me to ignore and I don’t want to invest the personal effort of my fandom towards him directly. I’m not taking a stand, I just don’t have the motivation to be a fan of a piece of Shit of his caliber and would rather spend that energy doing something else. I don’t want to deal with other fanbases bringing him up. I don’t really want to talk about him at all. \n\nThe owner of the team never got that energy from me. So the fact that jodie Allen sucks is of the same interest level to me as the thousands of other shitty people slightly adjacent to my life.\n\n## Comment ID i0icwez with +1 score by [(Capnjack84, Reddit, 2022-03-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/td5cgz/exbodyguards_accuse_jody_allen_of_sexual/i0icwez/) (in reply to ID td5cgz):\nRich people are fucking weird. “Oh security….please grab my suitcase full of coke, weed, giraffe bones and oh yea don’t forget the one with penguin skulls.”\n\n## Comment ID i0ico2a with +1 score by [(Capnjack84, Reddit, 2022-03-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/td5cgz/exbodyguards_accuse_jody_allen_of_sexual/i0ico2a/) (in reply to ID td5cgz):\nLink to Seattle PI article.

They do love the Blazers and Timbers, and sport is huge in the state in general.\n\nThe Portland metro area is probably large and wealthy enough. I feel like NHL hockey would have appeal as something new and different, which kind of fits with the eclectic attitude of the city, and the a lot of the state for that matter. \n\nThe biggest unknown is if there's enough interest to go around between the Blazers and the NHL. I just never knew anyone, friends, or co-workers, that had ever even given hockey a single thought. It would be a pretty raw market to develop fans in—similar to Vegas imo.

The Portland metropolitan area has a population of around 2.45 million, and out of the 50 biggest metro areas in the United States it is ranked 15th in population growth. That gives it a bigger population than the metro areas supporting the Jets, Sabres, Hurricanes, Oilers, Senators, Flames, Predators, Blue Jackets, Golden Knights, and Penguins.\n\nPortland is certainly big enough to support a team, the question is if it would do so. Atlanta is the 10th largest metropolitan area in the United States and Canada, with a metro population of 5.79 million, yet the NHL failed to keep a team in Atlanta *twice* (the Flames were there from 1972 to 1980, and the Thrashers were there from 1999 to 2011). \n\nCould it?

We've seen via Vegas how tremendously well an expansion/relocation can do even outside a \"traditional hockey market\" with the right plan.  But none of that is guaranteed.

This makes people dislike the idea more knowing that much money is going somewhere else, and the council doesn't want a new arena built (the mayor has vowed to  build as much \"affordable housing\" as he can).  All that said, the city council and mayor have all stated they are not going to okay a new team anytime soon.",

Welfare programs exist, and are intended to help address poverty. They have limited funds. Every dollar wasted on fraud is a dollar not making its way towards combatting poverty. This means there's a need for better fraud detection software tailored to the needs of welfare programs.\n\nWant to help save the environment? Pick an environmental problem, and help scientists working on it write code to model the issue, or identify problems spots. Help them apply ML techniques to build decision engines and predictive models and such. There's *loads* of possible work here, it just pays like shit compared to building a CRUD app for an insurance company or whatever.\n\nI think the reason you take such a pessimistic view is that you view this only from the \"big picture\" perspective. Obviously no one software program is going to solve the whole climate change problem. But specific environmental problems certainly can make use of better software to solve them far more directly than just writing some web app to help people sign up for a mailing list. There's a vast world of difference between tackling coding problems that help people solve real problems in real life... and trying to change the world with the internet.\n\nEach of these huge problems is made up of innumerable small problems--and those small problems are often problems directly addressable by software.\n\n#### Comment ID dwbjyii with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-03-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dwbjyii/) (in reply to ID dwbf8fy):\nOn one hand, yes--I most definitely have a pessimistic view due to the big picture perspective... but how is looking at the totality of the problem not the way to solve it? What matter is it, anyway, if your software can detect fraud when the organizations running these welfare programs don't have the budget to run and maintain it, or if the fraud-doers are backed by corrupt politicians whose contrivances are vast and pockets deep such that anything recorded by the software is easily nullified by bribery? What matter is it if your software can help scientists model natural phenomena and better understand the data, when solving climate change is against the business interests of oligarchs and politicians who, together, can ensure that none of your recommendations are written and enacted into policy and that you will systematically find it difficult to get research funding?\n\nAgain, tools. Software is not going to directly address these problems at large; policy and the implementation thereof by state officials, really, are the direct solutions. Or maybe being a billionaire like Elon Musk--but even his solutions to the most challenging problems of our species which states all over the world are deliberately ignoring aren't software products by themselves.

Bill Simmons named a recent podcast after this fact.   \n\nBut if we're being honest...\n\n... and it pains me to admit this...\n\n2020, in addition to many other shitty things, marks the official dethroning of the Boston Celtics as the GOAT franchise.  \n\n* Over the past 34 years, we only have 1 NBA championship (2008).   This week will mark the Lakers 8th during that same timespan (1987, 1988, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009, 2010, 2020)\n\n* As Laker fans like to point out, only 4 of our NBA championships took place after the NBA/ABA merger in 1976. This will be the Lakers 11th.  Bulls (6 titles) and Spurs (5 titles) also lead us in post-merger championships.\n\n* The bulk of our championships (57, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66) happened when the league was 8-9 teams deep.  \n\n* Magic (5 titles) vs Bird (3 titles) was a victory for the Lakers.\n\n* Even our 1 championship in 2008 was eventually vanquished by the Lakers when they won back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010... essentially turning KG and the 08 Celtics into a Joe Frazier-esque footnote to Kobe's Muhammad Ali-esque championship legacy.\n\n* Lakers = 33 Finals appearances to Boston's 21\n\nIt sucks, but it is what it is.  The Lakers are the NBA's greatest franchise.  Must be nice to be in Los Angeles.  \n\nGotta hope that Tatum and his team can build a little dynasty here and start chipping away at the Laker league dominance.   It's been 12 years since our last championship.

Unless we draft another Pierce type of player (hoping JT is a Celtic lifer) and build a competent squad with assets and using those assets to trade for a superstar, its hard to see how teams like Boston with no geographical advantage can build a true championship squad for a 5 year window. \n\nLuckily for us Danny hit in the draft with Tatum and Brown.

Most NBA players (at least superstars) prefer a warm climate as they don't have to worry about little things like comfort with humidity or heat since they make a fuck ton of money. Cold is much more pervasive than heat. MLB players don't have to worry about it, the MLB season is spring-fall without the worst of winter. NFL players are out by the end of January and while they do have to go through winter, it isn't all of it. NHL players are a bit of a wild card- unlike NBA/NFL/MLB players, most NHL players are used to the cold being mostly Canadian, northern American, Scandinavian, or Russian. The weather isn't some horrific turn off for them like it is for a young NBA player.  \n\nNBA players are generally the ones that like to go out clubbing and partying more obviously at bare minimum than most MLB/NHL/NFL guys (how many other guys have jokes about them like Paul George and strippers, or Harden and strippers, or Kawhi and stri... you get the point, the biggest I can think of it NHL players can doing rails of coke in bar bathrooms- Bozak, Kadri, Hall are the biggies on that). Boston isn't a town built on the glitz, glamour, and nonstop partying like New York, LA, or Miami that appeals to stars with a thin veneer of gold covering a pile of failed ambitions. We are a town built on actually building shit that applies to real life in the sciences. It is a college town with the best colleges and universities in the country right up there with the best in the world. What is isn't, ZooMass excepted, is a party city- you don't have the crazy parties or clubs that New York, LA, or Miami have. If a college kid just wants to party, they go to ASU not to anywhere here. There is stuff to do absolutely, but most of it focuses on learning or history. LA has no history as a city, Miami has no history as a city, New York has some, but that isn't what you think of with New York. Boston, after colleges, medicine, and banking, has history as a big draw. That isn't an NBA thing- look at Leveon Bell who enjoys slapping ass at strip clubs and riding around jet ski's in Miami who had two places on his wishlist in FA- Miami and New York. Artemi Panarin went right to New York when he hit FA despite having a good team around him in Columbus because his girlfriend could find more work there are a model and they are known for enjoying nights out.\n\nTaxes are another reason- part of why Miami is able to get players there, look at the NHL and the discount deals that guys like Hedman, Stamkos, Kucherov, ect. took to stay in Tampa since they get far more there with no state tax than a player in Boston, Toronto, Montreal, ect.\n\nNBA players also hit FA a bit earlier than any other sport as most come in and play right away at 18/19 and can be a UFA by 25 with a 3 year rookie deal and 4 on a second contract, most MLB free agents don't hit the market until they are 29 or older, the best players are at minimum 26-27. The NHL is about the same, 26 being only for the guys like Tavares, most hit it in the 27-29 range. Look at David Pastrnak, 3 year rookie deal, then signed a 6 year deal as a RFA, no NBA player is gonna sign a 6 year deal- it is 4 with a player option for a 5th year likely that they will decline to make bank at 25. The NFL is a bit different- players can be UFA's by 26 in spite of playing football, but the big names the Pats have signed have been people ring chasing or using BB as a method to get a big contract somewhere else.\n\nThat doesn't sound like much, but the biggest thing I have noticed is players who have a family love Boston. Jarome Iginla played here one year and then moved here full time after retiring because he felt it gave his kids a great education and that was important to him. Guys like Theis, Hayward, IT,  Horford, ect.- the ones with family love Boston as a city. It has a ton of great qualities for a successful family. It doesn't have much to appeal to a young NBA player who likely wants to party, fuck, and enjoy the hell out of their personal life. We see a lot of older people from MA move to places like Florida or Arizona if they can afford it after their families have moved on into their own lives because once they aren't a family, the perks of Boston aren't as important anymore compared to a warmer, easier climate for their bodies. That goes full circle to NBA players without any attachments. \n\nTL;DR: New York, LA, and Miami are the business majors who are built, constantly partying, and having a good time- Boston is the nerdy, in decent shape but not built pre-med major who is focused on academia more than the college experience, NBA players are sorority girls on Tinder who don't give a shit about anything beyond the next 24 hours when they are swiping.\n\n#### Comment ID g83w370 with +5 score by [(pittiv20, Reddit, 2020-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g83w370/) (in reply to ID g83m0o4):\nThe actual answer is because there is legitimately nothing for a rich black man to do in Boston.

Why is it then a credit to the Celtics? They sat home 14 times when the Lakers clinched.\n\nI know, I know, the Lakers lost 15 times in the finals, you folks say?

See how many top tier free agents went there and how many players indicated they wanted to be traded there. Shaq, Howard, Nash, Gasol, AD (who didn't want to go to Celtics mind you!), Lebron. How many decent 2nd tier, like Artest? Meanwhile Boston just had the KG + Ray Allen and recently Kemba, Kyrie was traded here and him being a cancer he left, so I don't even count that as a good trade. The rest they had to draft. Even Clippers are more attractive to players, cause it's in LA.\n\nKnicks might be worth more, but LA is THE team in NBA, they have it easy like Real Madrid in Spain - they are funded by the crown of Spain. Other teams like Boston, Miami, OKC and Bucks are more impressive cause they had to build it on their own. And Laker fans still think they were fucked on the CP3 non-trade. Puh-lease, if the league hadn't stepped in it might as well be LALBA (Los Angeles Lakers Basketball League).

I've also seen them on green ways with bike paths right next to them. So awesome!\n\nBut I saw the street car in south lake union (the SLUT) the other day stuck behind an unoccupied car that had parked too far out into the lane and was blocking the tracks. The street car just had to sit there indefinitely whereas a bus could just go around easily. Additionally the street car is subject to traffic lights and typical traffic...and it seems to take a long time to build and a lot of money to install. To me, the street car in Seattle is basically just a big bus that's subject to a track. \n\nSo if it's not gonna be in a dedicated travel lane or space, why have street cars at all? Buses seem cheaper and more practical for Seattle. \n\nWhat am I missing?\n\n## Comment ID ic94hm0 with +246 score by [(Greedy_Craft, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic94hm0/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nOff topic but the First Hill streetcar is so slow that I literally outrun it during my morning jogs lol.\n\n### Comment ID ic95ovf with +139 score by [(blahcubed, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic95ovf/) (in reply to ID ic94hm0):\nI have outpaced the SLUT walking casually.\n\n#### Comment ID ic9axcp with +49 score by [(thearchiguy, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic9axcp/) (in reply to ID ic95ovf):\nHey now.

It isn't individual to just Seattle -- basically all of the 2010's modern USA streetcar (not light rail) projects have failed. In DC, Atlanta etc... The high construction costs meant the streetcars couldn't travel anywhere far.\n\nCompared to the BRT (lite) routes which have become much more useful in Seattle itself and say in Oakland's BRT, Richmond VA's BRT, etc.. which have had much better ridership and also with the vastly cheaper construction costs been able to reach much more useful destinations than being a 1/2 mile neighborhood loop.\n\nThat being said, I will note that the dedicated transit lane on Westlake the 40 and C bus use were basically only achieved because of the streetcar. (Note that means a lot of other bus routes can be improved by bus lanes, not to spend streetcar money just to get one dedicated lane)\n\nAlso fun fact back in 2015\n\n[https://seattletransitblog.com/2015/12/04/sound-transit-presents-st3-options/](https://seattletransitblog.com/2015/12/04/sound-transit-presents-st3-options/)\n\n**Option C1D** is the “Westlake Rapid Streetcar” option\n\nOne of the options for the Ballard link extension was actually to extend the South Lake Union Streetcar up Westlake through Fremont then to Ballard. Not sure if actually a good idea as it would encounter a lot more intersections, but it was theoretically only 25 minutes to travel to ballard from sodo compared to 18 minutes so a bit longer.\n\n\n\n### Comment ID iclcrm2 with +1 score by [(bobtehpanda, Reddit, 2022-06-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/iclcrm2/) (in reply to ID ic9jffz):\nIf you put it next to the bike path it wouldn’t actually have to deal with many intersections.\n\n#### Comment ID icleikn with +1 score by [(reflect25, Reddit, 2022-06-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/icleikn/) (in reply to ID iclcrm2):\nFor Option C1D, along Westlake Ave N from SLU to Fremont there aren't actually that many intersections so it wouldn't be much of an issue.

They originally wanted to implement that in concert with the route restructure they did when the new Link stations opened last year, but that change was cut because neither SDOT or Metro wanted to pay to upgrade the pavement on the two blocks of street that don't currently support buses.\n\n#### Comment ID ic9firv with +3 score by [(PopPunkIsntEmo, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic9firv/) (in reply to ID ic9ddfd):\n>I’m really going to need to see some documentation about the savings given that to install one you must rip up and then re-pave wherever they’re going.\n\nNone of this is maintenance so not sure why you're asking me about it.

Busses usually cost more than a street car, are less energy efficient, and less dense with riders. Street cars have a psychological benefit of a sense of permanency that busses don't which tend to spur more business investment along the route than would happen with a new bus route. So economically, streetcars *tend* to be cheaper over a longer period.\n\nStreet cars have some soft benefits over busses as well such as being more easily understood, more comfortable, quieter, environmentally cleaner, spend less time at stops and more time moving, and are usually have better ridership.\n\nThat being said busses are great too. Relatively they're extremely cheap and quick to deploy. Cities can throw up new bus routes with decent stops in almost no time and very little upfront capital. Streetcar extensions take at least 5 years, often times getting as high as 15 years and cost a fortune upfront.\n\nMy opinion is that the city be focusing on deploying bus routes heavily across the city while simultaneously working on street car extensions in the most dense areas. As new street car routes come online, move the busses serving that route elsewhere or retire them if they're end-of-life, which with how long street car extensions take they very well may be.\n\n## Comment ID ic908cx with +103 score by [(HistorianOrdinary390, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic908cx/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nCars need a swift and harsh lesson that, no, they are not entitled to every inch of road in the city.\n\nBan cars from more streets, make more dedicated space for transit and alternative forms of transit.\n\nReduce the burden of SOVs so that those who *must* use them can do so with less traffic and those that have the option and mobility find transit to be just as good if not better.\n\n### Comment ID ic99nan with +44 score by [(AdultingGoneMild, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic99nan/) (in reply to ID ic908cx):\nremoving parking for cars along street car routes makes sense to me. open that space for bikes\n\n#### Comment ID ic9dy1f with +19 score by [(ALLoftheFancyPants, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic9dy1f/) (in reply to ID ic99nan):\nBike lanes next to streetcar tracks are very much  not ideal.

Also weird the way people are derogatorily using \"urbanist.\"\n\nI think any incidental failing of transit will be used as an excuse to crucify the whole system. People who are concerned about their lifestyle, especially when that lifestyle revolves around a car, feel threatened by talk of expanding transit and closing off areas from cars. Obviously, this prevents progress.\n\nTangentially, it's incredible how some people will mock gun enthusiasts but turn around and try to hang onto cars. \"Muh guns\" turns into \"muh subaru,\" but people don't see the irony in that they're defending the deadlier machine. Personally, I'm not big on either. \n\nThat might be a little too meta though, so to directly answer your question OP, Seattle's implementation of streetcars has been pretty lackluster. This is in part due to the programs being gutted by NIMBYs and likely exacerbated by the number of cars on the road. \n\nI'm not sure where in SLU this happened but ideally streetcar lines should run down the center of the street, with car lanes on either side, and parking should always be at least a lane or two away from the streetcar. The situation you described shouldn't happen with proper implementation. \n\nBusses certainly have a number of advantages over streetcars, especially the more environmentally friendly electrified buses. Like you said, they have more mobility options, and it's easier to reroute things if there's construction or an accident or so on. A lot of buses also fit people more efficiently than a streetcar.  \n\nBut on the other hand, buses destroy their own infrastructure very quickly, have longer boarding/offloading times, and are harder to automate. \n\nI think the ultimate answer to transit in Seattle is to use both. Buses can serve more far-flung areas and bring people in and out of the city center, while streetcars should be used to connect major destinations within the city.\n\n## Comment ID icbvm6x with +3 score by [(marssaxman, Reddit, 2022-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/icbvm6x/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nSeattle did not build the South Lake Union Trolley because it made sense as part of a comprehensive transit network.

Also add on how short the line is and the lack of connections to other transit lines (pretty much the only hub would be at Westlake station)\n\nWhy was it built? The SLU Streetcar was a vanity project for Paul Allen with his redevelopment of that neighborhood.  He effectively contributed half of the cost via LID taxes. (https://seattletransitblog.com/2017/12/15/seattles-streetcar-turns-10/)\n\nWhen the streetcar first opened, it had even worse performance than what you see now because it didn't have any dedicated transit lanes.  Not that the dedicated lanes today help too much since it still has to contend with right-turning cars, especially at Denny Way.\n\nIt eventually got semi-decent ridership during rush hour with the Amazon crowd up until Rapidride C was extended to run down Westlake. After that it made zero sense to take the streetcar over the Rapidride.  Which really proved that a bus makes way more sense in this corridor.\n\nThe only place I've seen a \"successful\" streetcar system that also has to contend with traffic is in Toronto.  That streetcar system has some insane ridership, but that's also because the lines travel through high density areas and have many transit connections.  They're certainly not fast, but the vehicles are massive and as such they are very cost-effective over buses at their ridership level.\n\n## Comment ID icammv0 with +1 score by [(fucktysonfoods, Reddit, 2022-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/icammv0/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nClose off all of downtown and Capitol Hill to cars and bring back horse drawn carriages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID ic9g2v0 with +1 score by [(seattlecyclone, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic9g2v0/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nA streetcar doesn't move anyone anywhere any faster than a bus running over the same surface. A streetcar sharing a lane with cars can get stuck in traffic the same way a bus sharing a lane with cars can get stuck in traffic. Similarly, giving the streetcar its own lane speeds it up exactly as much as a bus would be sped up on that same route by painting a bus lane.\n\nStreetcars are seen as a nicer ride than buses, so the politics of devoting dedicated lanes to them may be a bit easier in certain cases, but we've failed at that for most (all?) of our existing routes so not very relevant here. Streetcars are also larger than buses, so they can be useful to deploy on routes where you'd otherwise need to run a bus every minute or three...again not very relevant here. \n\nGiven all that I'd err on the side of using limited transit funds to improve bus service and/or accelerate Link development.

It _should_ also fit into their \"Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer\", but it clearly doesn't.\n\nI worked (briefly) at Amazon over a decade ago. Customer obsession is actually something I really liked - it helped drive clarity whenever there was some sort of debate about what you should do. And here, the term \"customer\" isn't just \"people buying stuff on amazon.com\" - it included your partner teams that use your internal service, or the engineers that are using your build system, or whatever. Your. Customers. Are. EVERYWHERE. It was actually pretty fantastic.\n\nAnd yet. And yet, Bezos seemed to have taken a lesson from the 90s-era Microsoft. Design a company in which it's every man for himself (and let's be honest, tech is mostly men). Stories abound about the interpersonal bullshit at Amazon. But the painfully obvious conflict here is that customer obsession was (and maybe still is?) pervasive **except** when it comes to how you treat your employees. A few years ago, they added their \"Strive to be Earth's Best Employer\". This was _long_ after I left the company. My outsider-looking-in assumption is that it's all corporate doublespeak/PR to cover for the shitshow that is their fulfillment centers. If you simply recognized that your employees - as a first-tier people manager, as a VP of some organization, or as the CEO - are **your** fucking customers, then you don't need a new principle and you can drive improvement - real improvement and not \"RTO or else\" bullshit.\n\n#### Comment ID lq7gx1n with +4 score by [(bpeden99, Reddit, 2024-10-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1fvd0ox/google_says_it_wont_follow_amazons_lead_with_a/lq7gx1n/) (in reply to ID lq7g84p):\nMy experience with Teamsters union made me have the attitude of us vs corporate...

I am a remote employee, but we need a home hub. So in this company's infinite wisdom they decided that remote was no longer an option so all employees in the Customer Success org are now what they call office flex. We have been given three options; relocate to 1 of 3 support hubs, find new position in the company, or get a severance. No exceptions for medical or family need. Relocate or GTFO. Mind you that I am a mission critical employee that leads support for a money making feature of this company. And so they can either let me stay remote, make what I am making now, and just update my hub to be another location. OR they can spend thousands of dollars relocating me (they are paying for moving expenses) and then adjust my income by 10% so I would make more due to the cost of living in the new office. So it makes more fiscal sense to simply let me be, but they feel that relocation is the better option???? So I would then relocate, sell my home, get a way more expensive home, and then probably get laid off a few years down the road.......\n\n## Comment ID lq7q9bk with +1 score by [(programaticallycat5e, Reddit, 2024-10-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1fvd0ox/google_says_it_wont_follow_amazons_lead_with_a/lq7q9bk/) (in reply to ID 1fvd0ox):\nCause all the ex MSFT shit managers went to Amazon— what did you expect.

          "cons": "I’m also very happy to have left. Vulcan lacks paying customers. Without that simple but powerful force, it is hard to keep a company pointed toward true north.\r\n\r\nIn my five years in the tech department, it had about three name changes and 4-6 leadership changes. With each regime change I would feel a new sense of hope. “This guy (note: always a guy) seems like he understands business. He’s not just interested in creating a wacky invention, but he wants to make products for actual human beings.” Inevitably, users would fall to the wayside and we would ultimately build something for a white guy sitting in an ivory tower. While Mr. Allen had good intentions and creative ideas, he often wanted a cutting edge engineering solution to a big humanitarian problem. The non-engineering solutions were too dull. But the engineering solutions were often out of touch.\r\n\r\nOne thing was consistent: the worker bees were passionate about making something amazing and functional. Similar to Mr. Allen, they wanted to make a big impact in people’s’ lives. They researched ways to make science fiction come to life. They are smart, kind, creative, sharing people. However, the people who get promoted spout empty promises. They strut in like Donald Trump, fabricating business models and customer needs.\r\n\r\nIn some ways, it's hard to fault these leaders. When there is no business, then lying with flourish is the best way to personally survive. If they can’t be successful by making a sale, then success has to come from a bloated sense of self worth.\r\n\r\nIn the last regime change, things have gone slightly differently. The customer we designed for was no longer Paul Allen but instead a nonexistent customer who wants futuristic products at a reasonable price. In trying to productize Paul’s ideas, they are taking something developed in a lab and trying to make it a commodity, underfunding any R&amp;D that would maintain differentiation.\r\n\r\nLeadership isn’t taking a strong stance in any direction:\r\n- If it truly wanted to build products, it would expand the team size to function comparably to a competitor. Right now, teams of 2-10 people are trying to create a full scale business.\r\n- If it wanted to operate as a tech transfer office, it would partner with major companies. Instead, it keeps its tech development under wraps.\r\n- If it wanted to be a Google X, it would focus on R&amp;D and build truly futuristic product prototypes and not worry about making a sale.\r\n\r\nVulcan doesn’t know what it is. It never has. It always sat in a technological purgatory, partially because I don’t think Mr. Allen cared enough to commercialize. Without Paul Allen, it loses a leader that had a sci-fi imagination. That might be a good thing since his ideas never touched the ground. It might be a bad thing because there are no longer any ideas.\r\n\r\nRight now, it is trying to commoditize futuristic ideas for an imaginary customer. Best of luck.",

Managers were brought in based on their credentials at the biggest tech companies but the strategies they learned there were inappropriate to the size, scope, and audience of Vulcan projects.  Imagine a 2 person 6 month research project. Now bring in 3 managers who insist on making the prototype 'enterprise grade', halting progress. Be sure to berate the engineers on their way out. Projects managers focus more on reporting progress than progressing. I've never been at an organization which spends the amount of effort this one does to tell employees how great it is to work there. I wish I left sooner.",

Senior management will do anything to keep their well-paying jobs: they repeatedly move/alter project goals/direction and blame their employees when projects don't go as planned. Self-preservation at Vulcan is senior management's primary goal.  A series of poor hires at the C-suite level have sent the company reeling. The technology department, in particular, is in upheaval and the new leader has a complete disregard for his team. Company morale has taken another massive beating.",

Anticipate more cuts, and don't be surprised if the company eventually folds entirely.\r\n\r\nThere were so many long term employees who had dedicated decades (yes, 20+ years) of their careers to this company. They were committed and passionate, and were tossed aside in often quite disrespectful ways. After so many rounds of layoffs, it was truly disheartening to see how incompetently our HR team continued to handle these events. Executives with flippant attitudes towards the process, and decisions made based on politics and personal whims of the Chair. Your success at Vulcan is not dictated by what you know or accomplish, but rather how in favor you are with the top leaders. As one person had commented upon leaving, they had never seen politics to this degree at any previous company, regardless of size.\r\n\r\nBottom line... proceed with extreme caution.",

Despite being an organization owned by a billionaire, there is an unreasonable financial austerity when it comes to HR that can sometimes stifle growth of employees and success of projects. In my opinion, the performance appraisal process here is very counterproductive. Employees are graded on a curve (remember college courses?) HR rejects the notion of \"stack ranking\", but under the hood, managers have to stack rank to determine how their teams members are distributed under the curve. The curve is determined by how well the company and department has been rated that year. The PA and goal-setting processes together extend over several months.",

Despite being an organization owned by a billionaire, there is an unreasonable financial austerity when it comes to HR that can sometimes stifle growth of employees and success of projects. In my opinion, the performance appraisal process here is very counterproductive. Employees are graded on a curve (remember college courses?) HR rejects the notion of \"stack ranking\", but under the hood, managers have to stack rank to determine how their teams members are distributed under the curve. The curve is determined by how well the company and department has been rated that year. The PA and goal-setting processes together extend over several months.",

Without that simple but powerful force, it is hard to keep a company pointed toward true north.\r\n\r\nIn my five years in the tech department, it had about three name changes and 4-6 leadership changes. With each regime change I would feel a new sense of hope. “This guy (note: always a guy) seems like he understands business. He’s not just interested in creating a wacky invention, but he wants to make products for actual human beings.” Inevitably, users would fall to the wayside and we would ultimately build something for a white guy sitting in an ivory tower. While Mr. Allen had good intentions and creative ideas, he often wanted a cutting edge engineering solution to a big humanitarian problem. The non-engineering solutions were too dull. But the engineering solutions were often out of touch.\r\n\r\nOne thing was consistent: the worker bees were passionate about making something amazing and functional. Similar to Mr. Allen, they wanted to make a big impact in people’s’ lives. They researched ways to make science fiction come to life. They are smart, kind, creative, sharing people. However, the people who get promoted spout empty promises. They strut in like Donald Trump, fabricating business models and customer needs.\r\n\r\nIn some ways, it's hard to fault these leaders. When there is no business, then lying with flourish is the best way to personally survive. If they can’t be successful by making a sale, then success has to come from a bloated sense of self worth.\r\n\r\nIn the last regime change, things have gone slightly differently. The customer we designed for was no longer Paul Allen but instead a nonexistent customer who wants futuristic products at a reasonable price. In trying to productize Paul’s ideas, they are taking something developed in a lab and trying to make it a commodity, underfunding any R&amp;D that would maintain differentiation.\r\n\r\nLeadership isn’t taking a strong stance in any direction:\r\n- If it truly wanted to build products, it would expand the team size to function comparably to a competitor. Right now, teams of 2-10 people are trying to create a full scale business.\r\n- If it wanted to operate as a tech transfer office, it would partner with major companies. Instead, it keeps its tech development under wraps.\r\n- If it wanted to be a Google X, it would focus on R&amp;D and build truly futuristic product prototypes and not worry about making a sale.\r\n\r\nVulcan doesn’t know what it is. It never has. It always sat in a technological purgatory, partially because I don’t think Mr. Allen cared enough to commercialize. Without Paul Allen, it loses a leader that had a sci-fi imagination. That might be a good thing since his ideas never touched the ground. It might be a bad thing because there are no longer any ideas.\r\n\r\nRight now, it is trying to commoditize futuristic ideas for an imaginary customer. Best of luck.",

Provide a path of upward mobility to employees instead of telling young people that there's no where to go within the company for them. Build a culture that cares about problem solving and creativity instead of filling out paperwork. Move department heads more towards an independent startup mentality of creation instead of putting them in a position where they have to protect their employees every day from C-level overreach.

Executives with flippant attitudes towards the process, and decisions made based on politics and personal whims of the Chair. Your success at Vulcan is not dictated by what you know or accomplish, but rather how in favor you are with the top leaders.

      "# [Rad Power names Kathi Lentzsch new CEO on 2025-03-13](https://www.bicycleretailer.com/industry-news/2025/03/13/rad-power-names-kathi-lentzsch-new-ceo)\nSEATTLE (BRAIN) — Rad Power Bikes named Kathi Lentzsch its new CEO. She comes to Rad Power from Bartell Drugs, where she was CEO from 2018 to 2020.\n\nIn announcing former CEO Phil Molyneux's exit last week, Rad Power also said it was laying off an undisclosed number of employees from its direct-to-consumer sales staff, while re-emphasizing and growing its Rad Retail and local bike shop locations.\n\n\"Rad Power Bikes is at an inflection point, shifting from a direct-to-consumer model to a more retail-focused approach, and it's an incredible time to come on board,\" Lentzsch said in a statement issued by Rad Power. \"This shift creates new opportunities to reach more riders, strengthen customer relationships, and evolve the brand in meaningful ways.\"\n\nAt Bartell Drugs, she led the company through a merger with Rite-Aid. Since her time at Bartell Drugs, she has served on several boards of directors. She was interim CEO of Gumps, a multi-channel retailer of luxury gifts, home decor, jewelry, and apparel, from 2016-2017. Previous to that, she was executive vice president of merchandising and marketing for World Market for nearly five years and senior vice president and division head for Pottery Barn for three years.\n\n\"What drew me to Rad is its unwavering commitment to innovation, sustainable transportation, and, most importantly, putting riders first,\" she said. \"I'm eager to work alongside this talented team to build on Rad's strong foundation of producing great products and partnering with the best bike shops to bring those e-bikes to riders, complete with a Rad Grin.\"\n\nThere's been more groaning than grinning at Rad Power since the brand received a $25 million funding round in February 2020 led by Vulcan Capital and Durable Capital Partners LP. Vulcan Capital is the investment arm of Vulcan Inc., the company founded by Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Paul Allen. Then existing investors added another $154 million in October 2021. Since its inception, Rad Power received financing totaling $329 million, which it claimed made it the best-funded direct-to-consumer e-bike company in the world.\n\nThe most recent round of layoffs was the sixth in three years.\n\nMolyneux had been with Rad Power since 2022 and succeeded founder Mike Radenbaugh. Molyneux worked with CFO Stephanie Roberts, who assumed the role of interim CEO, while the search for his replacement was underway. Before joining Rad Power, Molyneux was a regional president of Dyson and president/chief operating officer of Sony Electronics.",
      "# [This Tiny $2k Computer is Nuts by Nostalgia Nerd on 2025-01-05](https://www.nostalgianerd.com/this-tiny-2k-computer-is-nuts/)\nTHIS is the Vulcan Flipstart. Also an Ultra Mobile PC, but nobody really knows about this one. Which is strange, because frankly. This thing IS NUTS.\n\nWe’ll get to the details of that in a bit, but first, LIKE EVERY DAMN VIDEO ON THIS CHANNEL, Let’s rewind to the early noughties. A time when tech was getting smaller and smaller, as opposed to absolutely mammoth like today’s world of tech playing Tonka toy. God I loved things like my lil’ Nokia 7210i… and one person who also loved it and indeed, wanted to capitalise on shrinking tech was Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.\n\nAllen wasn’t alien to new ventures. In 1986 he founded Vulcan Inc. to oversee his family’s business activities and philanthropic endeavours. In 1992 he co-founded Interval Research Corporation, a silicon valley new business incubator that generated over 300 patents, including some which he would later sue Apple, eBay, Facebook, Google, Netflix and Office Depot to name a few for violating.\n\nIn November 1993, he acquired 80% of Ticketmaster. In 1997 he purchased National Football League’s Seattle Seahawks, and in 1998 he purchased Seattle’s historic Cinerama Theatre, quickly upgrading it to 3D capability…. and that’s just naming a few of his business side quests.\n\nSo, it’s no surprise that with various companies having jumped on the Ultra-Mobile PC Market, including the infamous Toshiba Libretto, Allen would like to get involved in that, especially given his ties to Microsoft.\n\nPreviewed at the 2003 Consumer Electronics Show with the code name Mini-PC and then First showcased in February at Seattle’s 2004 DEMO Trade Show, the same show that had launched the original Palm Pilot back in 1996, the idea was simple; create a fully functioning Windows XP machine but in handheld form, and it certainly got the media’s attention.\n\nBut this wasn’t the first computer of this type of be announced; The Tiqit eightythree was showcased two years prior at the Planet PDA Technology show in Boston, the OQO Ultra Personal Computer had been announced in 2001 and was due out later in 2004 along with the then called Sony VGN-U50, sans keyboard.\n\nWhat made the Vulcan FlipStart different was really the name behind it; Paul Allen. Given all these machines were going to run Windows XP, it seemed like the FlipStart should really be the one ahead of the game.\n\nHowever, ahead started to feel like behind when it took a further 3 years before the FlipStart was actually launched, with the first units shipping on 27th March 2007. Here’s how they arrived, which I’m going to unbox as I explain the fact that in between its announcement and launch a lot changed, politics, the world, tech, the manufacture process of Pears soap, everything. Which meant some of FlipStarts specs also changed.\n\nOriginal specs detailed a 5.8x4x1 inch size, just under a pound in weight, 2-6 hours battery life, 20GB Hard Drive, 256MB of RAM, a 5.6 inch HDTV quality display, and a Transmeta Crusoe CPU.\n\nThe actual size came in a bit more at 5.9×4.5×1.6, with an extra half pound in weight. That might not sound a lot, but it makes a significant difference in a handheld device. However, double the amount of RAM, a 30 Gig drive, 1.1GHz Intel Pentium M processor and 64MB Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 900 try their best to make up for that.\n\nEven said, the FlipStart was now entering a world where literal pocket sized devices like the BlackBerry were common in business and where the first iPhone was starting its domination of the rest of the mobile world. Even Windows XP had been succeeded, by Windows Vista, although really…. that wasn’t much of a problem.\n\nRoger Kay, president of Endpoint technologies commented on the FlipStart’s launch;\n\n“The only people who will want that is someone with a tremendous demand for mobility and isn’t compromised by a lack of a fully functional set, they might sell a few as executive jewellery, but they won’t sell any more.”\n\nBut Allen was still very much convinced in it’s potential; “Years ago, I began to imagine a super compact computer that would allow us to connect, communicate, work and relax, no matter where we are — one that is intrinsically intuitive to use. FlipStart is the first commercial product to meet that vision; it simply works as expected.”\n\nThe FlipStart Itself\n\nAs you can see, we got a lot in the box. A Quick Start Guide, manual, battery, headphones, a lil’ dock like thing, a case, AC adapter, a crap load of cardboard, and of course, the FlipStart itself.\n\nFirst things first, we have to connect the battery. As standard you actually get the chunky version that gives up to 6 hours life, or at least, it may have 17 years ago. Christ, 17 years, it’s old enough to drive. We can then plug the AC adapter in, and BOOM, we have life. Windows XP life. Well after it boots. Honestly, seeing a standard PC boot screen on something like this is just so weird to me.\n\nOne thing you recognise right away is the absolute build quality of this thing. It feels like some kind of nuclear grade military tech. Like it would win in a game of Chicken with a Nokia 3310. It’s just so robust and firm feeling.\n\nIt also feels immediately weird to be using Windows, even XP, on a device so small, and that’s not just because we’ve largely abandoned devices like this, but it’s also because, well, this feels like a desktop computer, but it’s tiny. The screen being crisp, the mouse tracking definite, plus the fact it weighs about the same as a desktop PC all help to give it that larger than life feel. Its almost a little uncanny.\n\nSo the FlipStart feels like a big PC in some ways, but the brains behind Vulcan knew that this very much wasn’t a full size PC, so we’ve got a number of features to help us cope with the change in scale a bit better.\n\nYou’ll note the trackpad is over on the right, with the mouse buttons over on the left. This works pretty well, especially as the pad can be tapped and scrolled like a modern day trackpad. But if you don’t fancy tracking, we’ve got one of those noughties nubs that people got into for a while. They’re an acquired taste, but you can use it to fling the mouse cursor across the screen rapidly. Next to the pad you’ll notice a discrete CTRL-ALT-DELETE button, which is considerate, and the arrow keys.\n\nBottom left, there are a couple of new buttons. This one brings up the dedicated FlipStart menu, which allows you to jump to files and common organisation programs. The zoom button here is especially useful, as it resizes the window you’re currently using to good effect, you can then scroll about if needed. Press it again, and you’re back to normal. Neat.\n\nStandard media controls at the bottom, then over on the right is essentially an ALT-TAB button, allowing you to flip between applications, and a desktop button which, well, gives you the desktop. These are all very useful features, especially in the XP era.\n\nBut how does it function?\n\nLet’s start with the keyboard. I mean, it’s not ideal. I’m sure you could get used to it, in the same way you get used to a ZX80 keyboard, but it’s more suited for thumb typing. The only problem is, you need pretty large hands to use it in that way, rendering it a little tricky for typing. Compared to the Libretto, which had essentially a proper mini keyboard, the FlipStart lags behind\n\nBut for general Windows operation, it’s pretty great. All you really need to do is connect up a full size keyboard, and maybe a monitor, and well, then it’s really not a handheld computer anymore, BUT the fact you can do these things makes it versatile. However we need the right ports for that.\n\nOn the front there, we’ve got our standard indicator lights, on the right we’ve got a jog button, a headphone jack and some media buttons on the lid for use when its shut. The rear reveals one USB 2, a power in, an expansion port and a little heat sink vent which pours out some pretty warm air. Oh, we also have a little screen on the top which gives access to emails and the like when you don’t want to open it up. You can navigate using that jog button on the side. Pretty good for conserving battery life. Plus if you have an American version you can put a SIM card in here and connect up to your mobile network.\n\nIf you’re wondering about that expansion slot, that’s where the Port Replicator plugs in. Giving us a VGA out, speaker out, ethernet and two USBs. It’s kinda like a mini dock, and allows us to go into that FULL productivity mode.\n\nHell yeah, this thing is pumping out 1280×1024 on our new monitor, along with 1024×600 on it’s own screen with no sweat. Alright, maybe a little bit, but LOOK AT THIS SIZE OF IT. It’s nuts. You can push the build in screen up to 1024×768 if you really want, but then you just have to scroll about. There’s no need the standard resolution is decent and looks sharp as a pin.\n\nAlright screw productivity, let’s try and play some games on this thing.\n\nYou know it kinda works, out of the box, the FlipStart shipped with a Quake 3 demo, to show what it’s really made of, and why not, it works pretty well for most games.\n\nThe only times I ran into trouble were trying to use these little arrow keys to games which are very much geared up to use standard arrow keys. Crazy Taxi is a bit of a pain.\n\nOh, also you’re not going to get far in Typing of the Dead on this thing.\n\nBut it’s great. It’s almost like a lil Steam Deck, well ahead of its time. I can see many an exec getting in a quick blast on Grand Theft Auto on a lunch break. Pop some headphones on and who’s gonna know?\n\nHonestly, it’s a shame this didn’t sell better, because it’s both a crazy and incredibly professional bit of kit, and I can see why they’re so sought after today.\n\nWrong Timing?\n\nHowever, the FlipStart witnessed a slow uptake, with it’s US price slashed by $500 just 6 months after launch. By January 2008, it was down to $699, or just £339 in the UK, and by the middle of the year, all initial units had sold out, with Vulcan downing tools and making no more. With all warranties expiring a year later, support was withdrawn and the FlipStart faded into obscurity.\n\nThe FlipStart felt like something that people wanted. It felt like something that could fit in pockets and be useful. But it was just a little too big and bulky for that, and if you’re going to carry something around, you might as well make it a more usable laptop, especially given you could get more bang for your buck.\n\nRoger Kay it seems was right, it was jewellery, a gadget, a cool toy to show off, with very few practical uses, and weirdly enough that’s exactly what it remains. Unless of course you want to just use it as a very expensive and rare XP gaming handheld. Then, go for your life.\n\nPaul Allen fulfilled his tiny computer dream, and in many ways it was a great success. It does everything that he set out for it to do, and it does it well. It’s just the market wasn’t there for it. It was going in the opposite direction, and in just a few years we’d all be playing with whopping great ipads. It’s a shame really, because tiny tech like this, really is cool as hell.\n\nSo there we go, that’s the Vulcan Flipstart ultra mobile PC. What a fantastic piece of kit from the past. It’s also about to go on my eBay shop, which has just re-opened! So if you want to pick this up, or anything else, follow the link below and see what you find!\n\nUntil next time, I’ve been Nostalgia Nerd, Toodleoo.\n\n“TOSHIBA LIBRETTTTO, why do you come to myy barrrr?…. [taps] Toshiba Libretto…*sniggers* people walking past like.. what the hell is going on??”",
      "# [Drexler Explains Celebration Absence, Knocks Bert Kolde by Dave Deckard, www.facebook.com on 2025-03-24](https://www.blazersedge.com/2025/3/24/24393458/clyde-drexler-portland-trail-blazers-feud-celebration-2025-bert-kolde-paul-allen-vulcan-inc)\nOver the weekend the Portland Trail Blazers honored their NBA Western Conference Champions teams from 1990 and 1992. Terry Porter and Buck Williams attended, along with family representatives of team members who had passed in the interim: Jerome Kersey, Cliff Robinson, Kevin Duckworth, Drazen Petrovic, Wayne Cooper, and Walter Davis. The Blazers even invited players who populated the deeper reaches of the bench during those years, including Ennis Whatley and Byron Irvin. Conspicuously absent was the leading player from those accomplished squads, the superstar for whom that entire era of Portland basketball is named: Clyde Drexler.\n\nUniversally acknowledged as one of the greatest players in franchise history, Drexler’s relationship with the Blazers has been on-again, off-again since he was traded to the Houston Rockets in 1995 following 12 years of service in the Pacific Northwest. The Blazers did manage to coax Drexler to a jersey retirement in 2001. Beyond that, the distance between the two parties has been pronounced.\n\nToday longtime Portland media member Kerry Eggers published a lengthy piece detailing Drexler’s side of the story about the recent celebration and his absence from it. The essay highlights a couple of immediate causes while underlining the rift between the All-NBA guard and the Blazers.\n\nDrexler cited his wife’s health as a major factor in his decision not to attend. Tonya Drexler is recovering from breast cancer. Clyde himself reported the good news that she was, “cancer-free,” though he is still tending to her.\n\nDrexler also claimed that the Blazers, somewhat incredibly, did not give him the date of the celebration. He told Eggers that he heard about the event in general through Porter and didn’t discover the exact date until Eggers, himself, called. Clyde claimed that as a significant oversight, telling Eggers, “They dropped the ball, but they have dropped many balls.”\n\nIt’s worth noting that Eggers cites the Blazers’ affirmation that they did, indeed, fully invite Drexler, the primary figure in their planned celebration.\n\nAfter covering that disputed point, the essay turns to Drexler’s long-term grievances, including and especially with Vulcan, Inc. executive Bert Kolde, a key figure under former Blazers owner Paul Allen since Allen purchased the team in 1988. Kolde remains in power to this day under the ownership of Paul’s sister, Jody.\n\nEggers points out that Kolde was an influential voice in the Blazers firing former head coach Rick Adelman, which in turn led Drexler to request a trade from the only NBA franchise he had ever played for to that point. Emphasizing the failures of the Blazers to maintain close bonds with their former players, Drexler excoriated Kolde:\n\n“As I understand, Bert has had carte blanche to run the franchise from behind the scenes,” Drexler said. “Look at what he has accomplished — very little. They have not been good at putting together a competitive team year after year. I look forward to the day when we get some new management and get Bert Kolde out of there so they can bring some of the past and merge that with the present. That is what franchises should be about.”\n\nDrexler also offered an olive branch or two, including light praise for current Blazers General Manager Joe Cronin, but Clyde seemed to make clear that he and Kolde would not be sharing the same philosophical—or apparently physical—space anytime soon.\n\n“I have had conversations with Joe and he seems to be a nice guy, but he can only do so much,” Drexler said. “Until the franchise is sold and they get rid of Bert Kolde, they will struggle.”\n\nEggers’ article goes into much more detail, including quotes from Porter and thoughts about the future of the Drexler-Blazers relationship. It’s worth a read.",
      "# [Paul Allen's Historic Computers Under the Hammer by Sue Gee](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/82-heritage/17430-paul-allens-enigma-machine-under-the-hammer.html)\nDozens of rare historic computers are currently up for auction. As well as a room-sized PDP 7, there's an Altair, an Apple I, a Cray I and an Enigma machine on offer to the highest bidder as the private collection of the late Paul Allen, is sold by Christies, New York.\n\nAs well as being co-founder of Microsoft with Bill Gates, the duo responsible for bringing BASIC to the home computer, specifically the Altair 8800, Paul Allen was an avid collector. During his lifetime he had amassed not only historic computers and notable technology, but also artworks and precious artefacts of all kinds.\n\nAllen was also a philanthropist who supported the arts, music, sport, science and technology. After resigning from Microsoft in 1983, he set up Vulcan Inc. in 1986 as an investment and project management firm with his sister, Jody Allen and two years later established the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation to oversee his philanthropic venture. Now, nearly six years after his death in October 2018, from complications of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a disease he was first diagnosed with in 1982, items from his private collection are being sold to further his philanthropic mission.\n\nIn fact the number of items is so large, so varied and so valuable that Christies has split them across three sales. The collective title for the sales is \"Gen One: Innovations from the Paul G. Allen Collection\" and expectations are high given that in 2022 a previous auction titled \"Visionary: The Paul G. Allen Collection\" and comprising 155 art masterpieces achieved $1.62 billion, becoming the most valuable private collection ever to come to auction. The artworks now going on sale are in one of the two online auctions that started on August 23rd and finishes on September 12th. As it's title, \"Over the Horizon: Art of the Future from the Paul G. Allen Collection\" suggest, works in the 57 lots are devoted to how the future, especially interplanetary travel, was imagined by artists and other thinkers during the 20th century including Chesley Bonestell, Robert McCall, R.C. Swanson, George Gibbs, and Fred Freeman. According to Christies:\n\nThe artworks in this auction, along with their publication in popular magazines, inspired a generation of explorers, scientists, and aerospace engineers.\n\nThe concurrent online auction is Firsts: The History of Computing from the Paul G. Allen Collection which Christies claim:\n\npresents important milestones in the history of computing, some of which have been preserved in working order\n\nThe 58 lots in this sale comprises the bulk of the contents of the Living Computers, the Seattle-based museum, which Paul Allen founded in 2012 to display his growing collection of historic computers and have them restored to working order and maintained by a team of engineers. In this video posted by Christies, Stephen Jones, Senior Restoration & Collection Manager, Living Computers sets the scene and introduces some of the historic computers that he used to be responsible for, presenting a timeline that highlights the breakthroughs in technology that the machines represent.\n\nAs reported in Paul Allen's Living Computer Museum Going, Going, Gone Living Computers had been forced to close to the public by the pandemic 2020. It never re-opened much to the disappointment of those who appreciated Paul Allen's aim of preserving vintage and heritage computers for posterity. One aficionado, Seattle-area tech veteran, Paolo Tosolini, founder of Tosolini Productions, had done a high-tech 3D photo scans of Living Computers and later created a more detailed scan of the first and second floors. Now, using technology from the 3D-capture platform Matterport, interactive “hot spots” have been added to 16 items that are up for auction, including the PDP 7 and the Apple 1 with links to lot details at Chrisitie's.\n\nClick on image to go to the Virtual Tour of LCM and see how Paul Allen's collection told the history of computing.\n\nWhile the online auction a mix of huge and small items, from the PDP 7 to mercury delay line memory from the Remington Rand Univac, the gems of the LMC collection are included in the \"live auction, \"Pushing Boundaries: Ingenuity from the Paul G. Allen Collection, taking place at Christies Rockefeller Center galleries in New York on September with viewing open from September 6-9. It comprises 36 lots, including Einstein’s letter to President Roosevelt which propelled the US into the nuclear age and crucial artifacts from the Space Race, including astronaut Ed White’s spacesuit cover layer, the pilot’s in-flight logbook from Apollo 8, and an annotated checklist from the first American spacewalk in June 1965.\n\nThe historic computers included in the sale all have important stories. The MITS Altair 8800 is as Christie's state:\n\nThe first commercially successful personal computer, which catalysed the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s.\n\nMore importantly for Paul Allen it was the machine for which he and Bill Gates, when they were 22 and 20 years old respectively, created a BASIC interpreter, to know more about this and how it led to the formation of Microsoft, see articles in our History section.\n\nWhile Apple Is are rare, the one included in the sale, with an estimate of $500,000-800,00 is unique. Around 200 units were originally produced and one of these was retained by the company probably to be used a as demo unit. As explained in the lot details this machine was removed from its place in Jobs’ office in 1985 by Don Hutmacher after Steve Jobs was dismissed from Apple and engineers were allowed to take items from his office. Hutchmacher's Apple security pass is included in the lot.\n\nBy way of Apple I memorabilia, the auction also includes a lot comprising two typed letters, the first of which dated 5 November 1976, is signed twice by Steve Jobs and has apologetic annotation in his handwriting. Its estimate is $50,000–80,000.\n\nThere's also an Enigma Machine. We've covered the auction of several of these over the years, seeing them realize from $100,000 upwards. This one is a four-rotor model, manufactured by Heimsoeth & Rinke in 1941 and has an estimate of $250,000-350,000.\n\nAnother lot that caught my eye is an IBM 360/91 console, which according to Chrisitie's:\n\nstands as a testament to the advanced technology of its era, representing the height of the System/360 line and offering a rare glimpse into the computing innovations of the 1960s.\n\nHaving been owned by Princeton University and exhibited by Walt Disney Picture in Tomorrowland in 2015, this example was restored at Living Computers. Having had new circuitry added, the console:\n\nnow includes an animated display demonstrating its operation, complete with a playful light show currently programmed where Pac-Man chases a ghost, adding a touch of modern whimsy to its historical significance.\n\nMoving forward a decade there is a Cray-1 Supercomputer. Only around 80 units were ever built and this one, Serial Number 12 was purchased in 1981 by the University of Minnesota and was designed to match UMN colors. After being decommissioned it was used as a sales model for Cray Research Inc. Only 17 Cray-1s are thought to survive and this is the first to come to auction with an estimate of USD 150,000 – USD 250,000.\n\nThere's a decommissioned Cray-2 in the online auction with an estimate of USD 150,000 – USD 250,000, but as yet no bid has yet been placed. One does have to wonder who has deep enough pockets and sufficient spare room to afford to win such an item. Although the computers are indeed important milestones in the history of computing they can also be seen as white elephants - expensive to maintain and a big responsibility due to their rarity.\n\nAs Stephen Jones points out in the video Living Computers was:\n\n\"a grand collection of restored machines, some of the most important milestones in the history of computing\"\n\nwhich Paul Allen had put together to inspire the next generation of technologists. Even though all the proceeds of the sales are destined for charitable causes, the idea that this collection is being dispersed, with much of it disappearing from public view, comes as a great disappointment to people, including those who had donated their computers to preserve them for posterity and to make them accessible to future generations.\n\nMore Information\n\nGen One: Innovations from the Paul G.

      "# [Are the Trail Blazers Any Closer to Being Sold? by Dave Deckard, www.facebook.com on 2024-07-31](https://www.blazersedge.com/2024/7/31/24209769/portland-trail-blazers-sale-rumors-jody-allen-nba-tv-rights-deal-broadcast-amount-vulcan-inc-paul)\nThe Portland Trail Blazers have changed coaches, general managers, and floor personnel over the last four years, but their ownership has remained the same throughout. As of July, 2024, Jody Allen and Vulcan Sports still hold controlling interest in the franchise, to the chagrin of many Blazers fans who expect—and perhaps want—the team to be sold. Are we any closer to that event this summer than we were last? That’s the subject of today’s Blazer’s Edge Mailbag.\n\nHello Dave,\n\nWith the new NBA television deal having been finalized, will that make it any more likely that Jody will sell the team to a new owner sooner rather than later? Perhaps she plans to hang on to the team indefinitely? What are your thoughts?\n\nPatrick B\n\nMeddling in the minds of NBA owners is perilous business, but I would guess that finalizing the new broadcast rights deal was a necessary step to setting the price of the team, should it be sold.\n\nLots of people guessed at potential numbers for the new contract. I’m not sure $76 billion over 11 years crossed anyone’s lips until it happened. Surely incumbent owners had a clue, but they couldn’t very well broadcast (ha!) the amount. Nor would it have shown up on organizational ledgers. Until the deal got done, it was vapor and rumor.\n\nNow both seller and buyer have a tangible forecast for this critical revenue stream over the next decade. That’s one of the two major undecided pieces, along with any expansion fees franchises might rake in. And the broadcast deal is by far the bigger.\n\nWith the numbers in place, sellers can now account for the increased value of the franchise during the span of the deal, while buyers can factor in the income from broadcast partners. This makes setting—and paying—a price much easier.\n\nSo I’d guess that if the Trail Blazers are going to be sold anytime soon, we’re one step closer to the transaction...one of the most important steps, at that.\n\nThat said, be careful what you wish for. Who buys the franchise next is going to be just as important as the final price or timing of the sale. Ownership is increasingly becoming the province of billionaires, a trend that late owner Paul Allen helped pioneer. Once upon a time, teams were purchased by fanatical, motivated individuals such as Allen and Mark Cuban. This had advantages and drawbacks, but either way, the owner’s connection to the franchise and its success was personal.\n\nAs the cost of entry soars into the billions, though, corporations are going to start to take over where individuals once ruled. The obsession will shift away from prestige and winning towards efficiency and the bottom line. That could spell disaster for a small-market franchise like Portland.\n\nWhenever the Blazers are moved, let’s hope they fall into the hands of someone who cares rather than the Executive Vice President of Sports and Marketing in some investment firm, simply looking to run the project for financial leverage. Call me stupid, but I’ll take a billionaire cowboy over an umbrella organization every time.",
      "# [Rad Power Bikes CEO Phil Molyneux to leave brand on 2025-03-11](https://bicycleretailer.com/industry-news/2025/03/11/rad-power-bikes-ceo-phil-molyneux-announces-exit)\nSEATTLE (BRAIN) — Rad Power Bikes announced that CEO Phil Molyneux will leave the brand and also confirmed its sixth workforce reduction, with this round affecting its direct-to-consumer sales staff as it continues to pivot more toward Rad Retail and local bike shops.\n\nMolyneux, who has been with Rad Power since 2022 and succeeded founder Mike Radenbaugh, will remain with the company and work with CFO Stephanie Roberts, who will assume the role of interim CEO until the search for a replacement is completed. Before joining Rad Power, Molyneux was a regional president of Dyson and president/chief operating officer of Sony Electronics.\n\n\"The best experience for our customers is when they can see and test ride our e-bikes at a local bike shop or Rad Retail location near them,\" a Rad Power spokesperson said in an email to BRAIN. \"Our Rad Retail and retail partner teams remain fully intact and ready to support new and existing riders, as well as local bike shops.\"\n\nLast March, BRAIN spoke with Molyneux for an April issue story, and he said the brand most known for its D2C sales channel was actively recruiting shops. There are more than 1,000 Rad Retail and authorized service partners in North America. However, in 2023, it closed its New York Rad Retail location. That same year, it closed its European operations.\n\n\"We're putting a significant investment into this direction in terms of tech development, for ease of ordering and investing in, and additional people to support the channel,\" Molyneux told BRAIN for the April issue. \"We have a dedicated call center. Part of the call center is dedicated to the local bike shops for service or support and queries in general. So I think we've made some good progress in that direction. And we'd welcome other local bike shops to reach out to us if they're interested in engaging and representing Rad and having a partnership together for mutual benefit.\"\n\nLast September, Rad Power said its bikes will be sold at 150 Best Buy stores and BestBuy.com. The company also announced it had hired bike industry veteran George Lee as director of sales. Lee will speak at CABDA Expo West on March 26-27.\n\nRad Power also did not say how many employees were affected in its previous layoff in July 2024. Following the reduction of about 100 employees in April 2022, Rad Power laid off another 63 three months later, and in December 2022, an undisclosed number were let go. In April 2023, Rad Power had another round of layoffs.",

      "# [Elephant Populations Decline by 30 Percent](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2016-5-september-october/green-life/elephant-populations-decline-30-percent)\nA comprehensive $7 million, three-year study released today reveals that populations of savanna elephants across Africa dropped by 30 percent between 2007 and 2014.\n\nThe Great Elephant Census estimates that there are currently 352,271 savanna elephants spread across 18 countries, representing approximately 93 percent of the species’ range. Surveys of two additional countries should happen by the end of this year. “It’s in the spirit of elephant movements that we’re trying to create one of the largest landscape mosaics in Africa,” said Dr. Mike Chase, the study’s lead author, in a video statement released with the findings. “What was heartbreaking was I didn’t recognize or fully comprehend the scale and the rate at which elephants are being killed for their ivory.”\n\nPopulations dropped by 144,000 animals in seven years and are currently declining at a rate of 8 percent a year.\n\nThe international survey was funded in part by philanthropist and Microsoft founder Paul Allen and managed by his organization Vulcan, Inc. More than 90 scientists, six nongovernmental organizations, and two advisory partners contributed to the effort. Participants conducted survey flights beginning in February 2014. Spotters looked out of the low-flying planes to count the animals. Over the past three years, pilots have flown more than 180,000 miles using 81 airplanes carrying 286 people. The results of the survey, which was first published yesterday in the journal PeerJ, are also available here.\n\nAllen has been a vocal opponent of ivory poaching. “In order to save the elephants, we need stronger antipoaching patrols in Africa’s parks, more protection for elephant habitats, and the political will to apprehend and sentence ivory-trafficking kingpins,” Allen said last month on LinkedIn. “Yet even these vital measures are only half the equation. In addition to eliminating the supply of ivory, we also need to do a lot more to reduce the demand for ivory.”\n\nAlthough international commercial trade in ivory was banned in 1989, a major study by National Geographic released last year found that the international ivory trade has more than tripled since 1998. The majority of the ivory ends up in Asia and the United States. Two countries, Zimbabwe and Namibia, have asked for permission this year to trade ivory legally, according to National Geographic. Twenty-six African nations have submitted a proposal to prevent any such legal trade.",
      "# [History of the Portland Trail Blazers by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2006-11-12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Portland_Trail_Blazers)\nSports team history\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers are a professional basketball team in the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association. The Trail Blazers are currently celebrating their 50th NBA season. The franchise owner is Jody Allen, who assumed ownership upon the death of her brother Microsoft co-founder and Vulcan Inc. chairman Paul Allen, in 2018.\n\nThe Trail Blazers' rallying cry is \"Rip City\", coined by play-by-play announcer Bill Schonely during their inaugural season. The team holds the NBA record for most consecutive sell-out games – set between April 9, 1977, and November 16, 1995.[1]\n\nThe Trail Blazers have retired several players jerseys, including Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame members Clyde Drexler and Bill Walton. Jack Ramsay, who was the Trail Blazers head coach from 1976 to 1986, had the number 77 retired in honor of Portland's only NBA Finals victory in 1977. Portland has had four NBA Rookies of the Year; Geoff Petrie (1971), Sidney Wicks (1972), Brandon Roy (2007) and Damian Lillard (2013). The only NBA Most Valuable Player that earned the award as a member of the Trail Blazers was Bill Walton in 1978.\n\nBackground and franchise opening\n\n[edit]\n\nHarry Glickman got interested in creating an NBA team in his hometown of Portland, Oregon as soon as the Memorial Coliseum was opened in 1960. The league commissioner at the time, Maurice Podoloff, refused on the grounds that Oregon was too far. Given that in the 1960s new commissioner J. Walter Kennedy expanded the league into the West, on February 6, 1970, the NBA board of governors granted Portland – along with Buffalo and Cleveland – the rights to a franchise in return for a $3.7 million admission.[2] Glickman got the money from real estate magnates Robert Schmertz of New Jersey, Larry Weinberg of Los Angeles and Herman Sarkowsky of Seattle – who was recommended by Dick Vertlieb, then general manager of the Seattle SuperSonics.[3]\n\n1970–74: Early franchise history\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Blazers started play in the 1970–71 NBA season, along with the Buffalo Braves (now the Los Angeles Clippers) and the Cleveland Cavaliers. The team was led by coach Rolland Todd, brought from the University of Nevada, and was based around Geoff Petrie, a first-round choice in the 1970 NBA draft out of Princeton University, and LeRoy Ellis, whom they acquired in the 1970 NBA Expansion Draft. In their first season, the Blazers finished with a 29–53 record, which was the best of the three new teams in the NBA.[4] Petrie was named co-Rookie of the Year after averaging 24.8 points per game.\n\nThe next season, the Blazers won only 18 games, but rookie Sidney Wicks was named Rookie of the Year after averaging 24.5 points per game and 11.5 rebounds per game. The following year, the team used the first pick in the NBA draft on LaRue Martin and the Trail Blazers finished at 21–61.\n\n1974–79: Bill Walton era\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Blazers did not beat their first season's record until they drafted Bill Walton from UCLA in 1974. In the first two years, under coach Lenny Wilkens, the Blazers improved, but still did not post a winning record (nor did they make the playoffs). In the 1976 off-season, Wilkens was fired and replaced with Jack Ramsay. In that off-season, four-time All-Star Sidney Wicks was sent to Boston and the team acquired forward Maurice Lucas in the dispersal draft that occurred when the American Basketball Association was acquired by the NBA.[5]\n\n1977 championship\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 1977 NBA Finals\n\nIn the 1976–77 campaign, the Blazers posted their first winning record, going 49–33 under the leadership of Ramsay. Bill Walton led the NBA in both rebounding and blocked shots, and was named to the All-Defensive first team. The team—Walton at center, Lucas and Bob Gross at forward, and Dave Twardzik and Lionel Hollins at guard—made the playoffs for the first time. The Blazers won the NBA championship in their first time in the playoffs. After defeating the Chicago Bulls (who were a Western Conference team at the time) and the Denver Nuggets (a surviving ABA team) in the early rounds, the Blazers defeated the favored Los Angeles Lakers, led by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, in four consecutive games. They then went on to defeat the Philadelphia 76ers 4–2 for the championship.[6] Following his dominating performance, Walton was named MVP of the NBA finals.\n\nThe team started the 1977–78 season with a 50–10 mark, and many predicted a dynasty in Portland.[7] Walton was named the league's regular season MVP and both he and Maurice Lucas were named to the NBA All-Defensive first team. A rash of injuries set in, however, most notably an injury to Bill Walton's foot that ended his season and would plague him over the remainder of his career. The team struggled to an 8–14 finish, and lost to the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1978 conference semifinals.[8] That summer, Walton demanded to be traded to a team of his choice (Clippers, Knicks, Warriors, or 76ers) because he was unhappy with his medical treatment in Portland.[9] Walton was never traded, and he held out the entire 1978–79 season and left the team as a free agent thereafter.[10] Maurice Lucas left the team in 1980, and the Blazers \"dynasty\" was finished.\n\nThe early 1980s\n\n[edit]\n\nDespite the loss of several key players due to injury (most notably Walton, who left the team in 1979), the team continued to play competitive basketball. The sellout streak continued. The team continued to make the playoffs every year except for one (1981–1982), and on several occasions advanced past the first round. However, the NBA's Western Conference at that time was dominated by the L.A. Lakers (with a few Finals appearances by the Houston Rockets).\n\nIn the 1978 draft, the Blazers (for the third time in their history) landed the #1 pick in the draft; and selected Mychal Thompson, a center originally from the Bahamas. Over the next several years; the team acquired several other players who many thought could form the nucleus of a championship contender—Jim Paxson, T. R. Dunn, Fat Lever, and Wayne Cooper.\n\n1983–94: Clyde Drexler era\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1983, the team selected Clyde Drexler, who would go on to a Hall of Fame career (eventually winning an NBA title with Houston).\n\nLooking for help at center, the Blazers used the #2 pick in the 1984 draft to draft center Sam Bowie. Although Bowie had missed two full collegiate seasons due to leg injuries, the Blazers took him while Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley and John Stockton were all still on the board. Bowie suffered a series of leg injuries that limited his production for the team; he even missed the entire 1987–88 season due to injuries. Bowie is now considered one of the biggest draft busts in NBA history. The Blazers had far better luck with their second-round pick, Jerome Kersey, who would be one of the anchors of the franchise for a decade. That summer, the team sent Dunn, Lever, Cooper, Calvin Natt and two draft picks to the Denver Nuggets for forward Kiki Vandeweghe.\n\nIn 1985, the team selected point guard Terry Porter in the draft.\n\nAfter several consecutive seasons of losing in the first round, the Ramsay Era ended in the summer of 1986 when the long-time coach was fired and replaced with Mike Schuler.\n\nSummer of 1986\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the first round of the draft, the Blazers (who had two picks) selected forward Walter Berry out of St. John's and center Arvydas Sabonis out of the Soviet Union. Later in the draft, the team reached behind the Iron Curtain again, and chose guard Dražen Petrović from what was then Yugoslavia. Drafting two players from the Eastern Bloc was highly controversial—the Cold War was still going on, and many doubted that either player would be permitted to come play in the NBA. (The selection of Sabonis would become even more controversial in 1988, when the Lithuanian center was allowed to come to Portland to train, and then led the Soviet Union to a gold medal in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.)\n\nAfter only a few months with the team, Berry was traded to the San Antonio Spurs for another rookie, center Kevin Duckworth.\n\n1986–88: Mike Schuler era\n\n[edit]\n\nMike Schuler was hired prior to the start of the 1986–87 season as head coach of the Blazers. In his first two campaigns, the Schuler-led Blazers posted records of 49–33 (in 1986–87) and 53–29 (in 1987–88). Both teams made the playoffs (with home court advantage) but were defeated in the first round (to Houston in 1987, and to the Utah Jazz in 1988). In both years, the Blazers were among league leaders in scoring, but near the bottom of league rankings in defense and rebounding statistics.\n\nThe Schuler era was marked by several controversies regarding the starting lineup. The first such controversy occurred when Clyde Drexler won the starting guard spot over veteran Jim Paxson, who subsequently demanded (and got) a trade; eventually traded to Boston for Jerry Sichting. In the 1987–88 campaign, veteran center Steve Johnson was injured, and was replaced in the lineup by Duckworth, who went on to win the starting job from the foul-prone Johnson. As the team was winning, these controversies were glossed over at first.\n\n1988–89: The season of change\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the conclusion of the 1987–88 campaign, the team was purchased by current owner Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft for $70 million from Larry Weinberg.[11] The sale made Allen, then 35, the youngest team owner in all of the Big Four professional sports.[12] The team quickly fell apart during the year, as the issue of who should start became paramount. In addition, many veterans were unhappy with Mike Schuler's coaching style[citation needed]; as a result the team limped to a 39–43 record and barely made the playoffs (where it was ousted by the Lakers 3–0 in the first round). Schuler was fired; assistant Rick Adelman was given the head coaching job on an interim basis.\n\nThat summer, Sam Bowie and a draft pick were traded to the New Jersey Nets for veteran forward Buck Williams, a respectable defensive and rebounding power forward. Vandeweghe was sent to the New York Knicks for a draft pick, and Johnson was taken by the expansion Minnesota Timberwolves in the expansion draft. Dražen Petrović was permitted by the Yugoslav authorities to come to Portland and join the team. For the second round of the draft, Portland selected a young forward from UConn, Clifford Robinson.\n\n1989–92: Return to the finals\n\n[edit]\n\nWith the exception of the championship year of 1976–77 (and the following season), the early 1990s is generally regarded as the greatest era in team history[citation needed]. In the 1989–90 campaign, the team posted a 59–23 record, and defeated the Dallas Mavericks, San Antonio Spurs, and Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference playoffs. The team was ultimately defeated by the defending-champion Detroit Pistons, led by Bill Laimbeer and Isiah Thomas, 4–1.\n\nThat off-season, Petrović joined the New Jersey Nets, where he would perform at an All-Star level[13] before his death in an auto accident in 1993. To replace him, the team signed free agent guard Danny Ainge, who had won three titles with the Boston Celtics in the 1980s. In the 1990–91 season, the Blazers posted a 63–19 record—the best in the league and the best in franchise history. They ended the Lakers' nine-year reign over the Pacific Division and won home-court advantage throughout the playoffs. The season ended when the Lakers defeated the Blazers 4–2 in the Western Conference finals.\n\nIn the 1991–92 campaign, the Blazers repeated as Pacific champions. They steamrolled through the Western Conference playoffs en route to a showdown with the Chicago Bulls in the Finals—one that they lost 4–2, and which cemented the reputations of both Jordan and Drexler (placing the latter firmly in the former's shadow).\n\n1992–94: End of the Adelman era\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the 1991–92 campaign, Ainge left for Phoenix and became a major player in the Suns' run to the finals in the following season. To replace him in the backcourt, the Trail Blazers signed free agent guard Rod Strickland from the Spurs.[14][15]\n\nIn 1992–1993, a series of injuries and other issues started to plague the team. Duckworth, Drexler, Kersey, and Buck Williams began to drop in performance and Drexler and Kersey missed a combined 50 games due to injury. Despite this, the team posted a 51–31 record and landed a spot in the Western Conference finals. They were defeated by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round, 1–3. Owner Paul Allen started breaking ground on the Rose Garden, which would replace the Memorial Coliseum as the teams home stadium.\n\nDuring this season, several Blazers players were involved in a sexual assault case involving minors. Utah police investigated 6 Blazer players for sexually assaulting two 16-year-old girls in Salt Lake City. The minors reported to have met with the men at a hotel at night and engaged in sexual relations. Dave Johnson, Tracy Murray, Reggie Smith and Jerome Kersey were connected to the case. Criminal charges were not pressed due to a lack of evidence. Johnson and Murray were fined and suspended without pay for three games, and Kersey and Smith were fined. The Blazers senior vice president for operations at the time, Geoff Petrie, released a statement:\n\n“We do not take breaches of our policies or team rules lightly and feel deep regret that some of our players have shown poor judgment, and for that we apologize,”[16] Both Kersey and Smith publicly released apologies, but denied performing stagetory rape. Murray and Johnson have not publicly spoken on the situation.\n\nIn the 1993–94 season, Terry Porter suffered an injury and was replaced in the starting lineup with Strickland. Duckworth was traded in the off-season to the Washington Bullets for forward Harvey Grant. To replace Duckworth, center Chris Dudley was signed to a one-year contract, a deal that NBA commissioner, David Stern, viewed as an attempt to circumvent the league's salary cap. They ended the season with a 49-33 and made it to the Western Conference finals. They were defeated by the Houston Rockets in the first round, 1–3.Adelman was fired and replaced with Seton Hall coach P. J. Carlesimo.\n\n1994–96: Bob Whitsitt era\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1994–95 season was the first in the reign of \"Trader\", Bob Whitsitt. At the time, Whitsitt was viewed as one of the smartest executives in the NBA for leveraging the salary cap and other details of the collective bargaining agreement between the NBA and its players. He was known mostly for his work with the Seattle SuperSonics. After a falling-out with Sonics' owner Barry Ackerley, Whitsitt was hired by Paul Allen to rebuild the team.\n\nThe 1994–95 was also the last Blazers season for Clyde Drexler, ending an 11-year run at the franchise. Drexler was traded in the middle of the season to the Houston Rockets for Otis Thorpe and a draft pick. He went on to lead the Houston Rockets to a second consecutive NBA title. He is regarded as one of the best Blazers player's in franchise history and his number (22) was retired in 2001. The 1994–95 campaign was also the last year in the Memorial Coliseum.\n\nThe Blazers that year were an above-average defensive team but a poor offensive one. They posted a 44–38 record and were swept by Phoenix in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nIn 1995–96, the team moved into their new home stadium, the Rose Garden, now the Moda Center. The team was led in scoring by Robinson. Bob Whitsitt got into contact with Lithuanian center Arvydas Sabonis, from Real Madrid Baloncesto in the EuroLeague. Sabonis had several previous injuries, which was an initial concern of the coaching staff, but he ended up being signed to the Blazers. Sabonis averaged 14.5 points, 8.1 rebounds & 24 minutes per game during his rookie year and won NBA All-Rookie First Team in 1996. The Blazers finished the season with a 44–38 record, and were defeated by the Utah Jazz, 3–2, in the Western Conference finals. In game five of the series, the Blazers were defeated 102–64, setting a record at the time for the fewest points scored in a playoff game. This season marked the final year for forward Buck Williams, a prominent player for the team's two championship runs.\n\n1996–2000: Wallace & Pippen\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1996 off-season had several roster changes for the Blazers. Strickland and Harvey Grant demanded to be traded,[17] and was sent to the Washington Bullets, now known as the Washington Wizards. In return, the team received forward Rasheed Wallace, who would become one of the best players in franchise history.[18] Isaiah Rider from the Minnesota Timberwolves was also traded to the team, but was quickly traded away for Smith after being cited for marijuana possession.[19] To replace Strickland, the Blazers signed playground legend Kenny Anderson to a free-agent contract.[20] In the 1996 draft that year, the team selected high schooler Jermaine O'Neal as a first round pick, 17th overall.\n\nCarlesimo was fired and replaced with Mike Dunleavy in 1997.[21] In addition to Dunleavy, the 1997–98 campaign saw two other important new faces: forward Brian Grant who was signed as a free agent in the off-season, and guard Damon Stoudamire, who was acquired in a mid-season trade with the Toronto Raptors for Anderson.[22] In his first NBA seasons with Toronto, the Portland native won Rookie of the Year honors and posted All-Star quality numbers for the Raptors, and reminded many of a young Isiah Thomas. Many expected that \"Mighty Mouse\" would become the franchise player the team had lacked since Drexler left. Clifford Robinson would also leave the team and join as a free-agent on the Phoenix Suns.\n\nIn the abbreviated 1999 season, the Blazers advanced to their third conference final of the decade, only to be swept by the Spurs. The tone was punctuated in Game 2 of the series, when Spurs forward Sean Elliott hit a game-winning 3-pointer, which is referred to as the \"Memorial Day Miracle.\" That off-season, the Blazers made one of the franchise's most notable acquisitions, making a blockbuster (six-for-one) trade for six-time NBA champion Scottie Pippen after his Houston Rockets stint.\n\nIn 1999-2000 the team ended the season with a 59–23 record, 2nd seed for the West and sent them to the conference finals. With Stoudamire, Anderson, Pippen, Wallace, Sabonis and Grant, they finished with the second-best record in the league. In Western Conference finals, they played against the Los Angeles Lakers with Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal. The Blazers were defeated in the series 4–3, ending their playoff campaign.\n\nThe Jailblazers: 2000-2003\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2000 offseason, Brian Grant was traded to the Miami Heat in a three-team deal, which brought Shawn Kemp from the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Blazers, reuniting Whitsitt with Kemp. Management and coaching staff expressed a worry over the team's lack of \"big bodies\" to defend against Shaquille O'Neal. This led to forward/center Jermaine O'Neal being traded to the Indiana Pacers for Dale Davis. This trade was regarded as a disastrous move by the Blazers, as Jermaine O'Neal would go on to become an 6-time All-Star. Finally, the Blazers signed the free agent forward Ruben Patterson, a controversial decision due to his criminal background.\n\nWith the new lineup, the team won 42 of their first 60 games. After Wells suffered a season-ending injury, the team was swept in four games by the Lakers.\n\nThat offseason the churning continued; Dunleavy was fired,[23] and replaced with Maurice Cheeks, a \"players' coach\" who some thought would relate better to the players than Dunleavy did.[24] More transactions followed as the Blazers traded Steve Smith to the Spurs for Derek Anderson.[25]\n\nNicknamed The \"Jail Blazers\"\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Trail Blazers made a series of personnel moves in the 2000 and 2001 off-seasons that failed to produce results. Forward Jermaine O'Neal was traded to the Indiana Pacers for Dale Davis. Brian Grant signed with the Miami Heat, and was replaced with ex-Seattle forward Shawn Kemp.A particular criticism was that Whitsitt was attempting to win a title by assembling a roster of stars while turning a blind eye to team chemistry and bad sportsmanship.[26] Longtime NBA coach and analyst, Doug Collins, referred to Whitsitt as a \"rotisserie-league manager.\"[27] A fan was ejected from the Rose Garden for holding up a banner that said \"Trade Whitsitt,\".[28] Mainstream media began referring to the team as \"Jail Blazers\" due to behavioral issues the players of the franchise during this time.[29][30][31] Ruben Patterson joined the team, who had previously pleaded no contest to a felony sexual assault charge and was required to register as a sex offender.[32] Several players including Wallace, Stoudamire, and Qyntel Woods, were cited for marijuana possession.[33] Woods pleaded guilty to first-degree animal abuse for staging dog fights in his house, involving his pit bulls, Hollywood and Sugar. The dogs confiscated, Woods was given 80 hours of community service and donated $10,000 to the Oregon Humane Society.[34] Rasheed Wallace was suspended for seven games for threatening a referee.[35] In 2003, Zach Randolph reportedly attacked Rubin Patterson during a practice, fracturing bones around his eye socket.[36] In 2024, Rasheed Wallace recalled another event leading up to the punch on Gilbert Arenas podcast, Gil's Arena, in which he described a time Patterson aggressively slammed Randolph into the ground in their locker room. In 2004, Portland police responded to a security alarm at Stoudamire's home and ended up finding a pound of marijuana in a crawlspace while searching the premises.[37] The police search was later declared illegal and all charges were dropped.[38] Guard Bonzi Wells famously told Sports Illustrated in a 2002 interview:\n\nWe're not really going to worry about what the hell (the fans) think about us. They really don't matter to us. They can boo us everyday, but they're still going to ask for our autographs if they see us on the street. That's why they're fans, and we're NBA players.[39]\n\nThe teams problematic behavior and misconduct resulted in disapproval by fans, and attendance at the Rose Garden started to decline.[28] In the summer of 2003, with attendance declining, issues between players, and an exorbitant payroll, Whitsitt announced that he would leave the team to focus on Paul Allen's other franchise, the Seattle Seahawks.[40]\n\nThe Patterson/Nash era\n\n[edit]\n\nSteven Patterson and general manager John Nash joined the organization began to rebrand the franchise in hopes of cleaning up the teams image after the several instances of misconduct and aggression from the players. A \"25 point pledge\" was announced to fans as a standard they'd be held to; code of conduct with 25 steps the organization would take to promote sportsmanship. The Blazers' draft pick that year was Travis Outlaw, the son of a police officer, which was suspected to be an aid in rebranding the team.\n\nIn the 2003–04 season, Bonzi Wells cussed out Cheeks during practice, which led to a suspension. He was soon traded to the Memphis Grizzlies for Wesley Person and a first-round pick. In an interview with the Oregonian, Rasheed Wallace claimed that the NBA exploited African American players after the media nicknamed the teams the \"Jailblazers\". Wallace's claims were denounced by the team, and the league.\n\nDuring the season, point guard Jeff McInnis was sent to Cleveland with Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje for forward Darius Miles. Wallace was sent to the Atlanta Hawks along with Person for forward Shareef Abdur-Rahim, center Theo Ratliff and Dan Dickau. The team ended the season with a 41–41 record and missed the playoffs for the first time since 1981. The Blazers' had 21 straight playoff appearances was the second longest in the NBA, behind the 76ers's 22 consecutive playoff appearances.\n\n2004–2005\n\n[edit]\n\nThe team selected Sebastian Telfair, a high-school player from New York City, with its first draft pick. The team also selected two European players, Viktor Khryapa and Sergei Monia, with later picks, as well as Korean center Ha Seung-Jin in the second round. Three players—Darius Miles, Ratliff, and Zach Randolph—were given large contract extensions in the summer of 2004. Dale Davis was traded to the Golden State Warriors for also-disgruntled guard Nick Van Exel, and center Joel Przybilla was signed to a free agent contract.\n\nWhen the season started, the starting lineup consisted of Ratliff, Randolph, Abdur-Rahim, Stoudamire, and Anderson. For the early part of the season, the team played mostly a .500 record and could not win a game for more than 2 consecutive games. Multiple players suffered injuries, Anderson, Abdur-Rahim, and Randolph, who missed several games. In addition, the teams home facility filed for bankruptcy became a major distraction for the franchise. Television ratings also fell through.[41]\n\nOn March 2, 2005, Cheeks was fired and replaced on an interim basis by director of player personnel Kevin Pritchard. More playing time was given to a cast of young players including Telfair, Travis Outlaw, Khryapa, Przybilla, and Ha. The team qualified for the lottery.\n\nFinancial difficulties\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the end of the 2003 season, after which Bob Whitsitt resigned, the franchise was public about its financial issues. Several players viewed by many as \"assets\" were traded or allowed to depart via free agency with no attempt to re-sign them. Oregon Arena Corp., the Blazers' sister company, declared bankruptcy in 2004. Because of the bankruptcy, owner Paul Allen lost control of the Rose Garden, which was turned over to the creditors.[42]\n\nIn February 2006, team management went public with the claim that without the revenue from the Rose Garden, the Blazers have found it difficult to turn a profit.[43] NBA Commissioner David Stern stated, \"My goal on behalf of the league would be to keep the team in Portland, playing in the Rose Garden, with economic prospects that make some financial sense.\" The Blazers are contractually obligated to play in the Rose Garden until 2023.[44] However, some believe a bankruptcy filing, were it to occur, and might eliminate any restrictions on the team's ability to relocate.[citation needed] Allen put the Blazers up for sale during the season, receiving several bids for the franchise, but took it off the market in August 2006.\n\n2005–2006\n\n[edit]\n\nIn July 2005, the Blazers announced the hiring of Nate McMillan as their new head basketball coach, ending a several-month-long search. Other candidates for the position included Marc Iavaroni, Terry Porter, and Lionel Hollins.[citation needed]\n\nThe Blazers won the #3 pick in the 2005 draft. On draft day, however, the team traded the pick to the Utah Jazz for the #6 and #27 picks in the 2005 draft, and a conditional pick in the 2006 draft (belonging initially to the Detroit Pistons). The Blazers used the #6 pick to draft Martell Webster. The 27th pick was used to draft Linas Kleiza, and the 35th pick (the Blazers' own) was used to draft Ricky Sánchez. The 27th and 35th picks were traded on draft night for the Denver Nuggets #22 pick, Jarrett Jack.\n\n2005–2006 season\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral controversies arose during the 2005–06 season. Sebastian Telfair, had issues with McMillan. Forward Ruben Patterson engaged in several public battles struggles with McMillan and earned a lengthy suspension from the team. Zach Randolph, recovering from a knee injury, was criticized for his alleged poor work ethic. Darius Miles also had issues with McMillan, including a game where he changed into street clothes at halftime in protest of lack of playing time. Both Miles and Randolph publicly requested trades, and Randolph later apologized. In May 2006, Miles gave an interview with The Oregonian reporter Jason Quick in which he admitted to coming to practice with alcohol on his breath.[45] Telfair, Miles, Randolph, Theo Ratliff, and Joel Przybilla also spent significant minutes out with injuries. The Blazers finished the season 21–61, the worst in the NBA, and landed the fourth pick in the 2006 NBA draft.\n\n2006–2012: LaMarcus Aldridge and Brandon Roy era\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 2006 NBA draft the Blazers traded Viktor Khryapa and draft rights for Tyrus Thomas for draft rights to LaMarcus Aldridge. The Blazers pickedBrandon Roy 6th in the draft.\n\nIn the spring of 2007, Steve Patterson resigned as team president,[46] and Paul Allen entered into an agreement to re-purchase the Rose Garden.[47] On the court, the team finished with a 32–50 record, an 11-game improvement, and rookie shooting guard Roy was named the 2006–07 Rookie of the Year.[48] That summer Pritchard was promoted to general manager,[49] and former Nike Inc. executive Larry Miller was hired as team president. The Blazers won the 2007 NBA Draft Lottery and selected Ohio State center Greg Oden with the No. 1 pick in the draft. Some had speculated that they might choose Kevin Durant instead;[50] Durant was picked at No. 2 by regional rivals the Seattle SuperSonics. Oden suffered a pre-season knee injury requiring microfracture surgery, and missed the entire 2007–08 season.[51] Oden's constant battle with injuries and Durant's success resulted in comparisons to the Blazers' selection of Sam Bowie over Michael Jordan in 1984.[52]\n\nThey had a 13-game winning streak that began in early December, resulting in a 13–2 record, an NBA best, for the month of December. McMillan won NBA Coach of the Month honors, and Roy garnered NBA Western Conference Player of the Week honors in back-to-back weeks (the first Trail Blazer to accomplish the feat since Clyde Drexler in the 1990–91 season). Roy was also named as a reserve for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, the first All-Star for the Blazers since Rasheed Wallace in 2001.[53] The Blazers finished the season 41–41, their best record since the 2003–04 season.\n\nThe 2008–09 season, Greg Oden debuted with the Blazers, playing in 61 games. Portland welcomed Spanish swingman Rudy Fernández, and French-native Nicolas Batum. Roy appeared in his second straight All-Star Game, and Fernández competed in the Sprite Slam Dunk Contest during NBA All-Star Weekend. Roy had a career-high 52 points against the Phoenix Suns and game-winning shots against the Houston Rockets and New York Knicks.[54][55][56][57] The Blazers clinched a playoff berth for the first time since 2003 and achieved a 54–28 record, their first winning record since the 2002–03 season.[58] As the fourth seed and holding home-court advantage, the Trail Blazers played the fifth-seeded Houston Rockets in the 2009 Playoffs, losing the playoff series 4 games to 2. Many[who?] credited Portland's loss in the first round to the team's young age and inexperience. However, the 2008–09 season was most notable[according to whom?] for the inspiring team chemistry on and off the court, for the potential for a young, energetic group in the upcoming seasons, and for bringing respect back to the franchise – attributes that fans had been missing for over a decade.\n\nIn the 2009 off-season, the Trail Blazers traded the No. 24 pick to Dallas for the No. 22 pick and selected Víctor Claver. They also selected Villanova forward Dante Cunningham with the No. 33 pick, Jon Brockman and guard Patrick Mills. Brockman was traded to the Kings in exchange for No. 31 pick Jeff Pendergraph. Free agent Channing Frye signed with the Phoenix Suns and Sergio Rodríguez was traded to the Kings. The Blazers attempted to sign free agent small forward Hedo Türkoğlu, who led the Orlando Magic to the 2009 NBA Finals, but after a verbal agreement he decided to sign with the Toronto Raptors. The Blazers then attempted to sign restricted free agent Paul Millsap; however, their offer was matched by the Utah Jazz. On July 24, 2009, the Trail Blazers signed point guard Andre Miller.\n\nReserves Nicolas Batum and Rudy Fernández started the season on the inactive list and forward Travis Outlaw soon followed after a serious foot injury early in the season. Centers Greg Oden and Joel Przybilla suffered season-ending knee injuries in December, while Brandon Roy and LaMarcus Aldridge played through shoulder, hamstring, ankle and knee injuries respectively.[clarification needed] Head Coach Nate McMillan also suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon during practice. Because of the void at the center position, Blazers general manager Kevin Pritchard worked out a deal to acquire Marcus Camby from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Steve Blake and Travis Outlaw. Although wins did not come as easily as the season before, the Blazers rallied to finish at 50–32, and placed 6th in the West. Brandon Roy underwent surgery after suffering a torn meniscus in his right knee, but returned for Game 4 of the first-round series against the Phoenix Suns.[59] However, the accumulation of injuries was too much to bear, and the short-handed Trail Blazers lost the series 4–2 to the Suns.[60]\n\nDuring the 2010 off-season, the Blazers' front office experienced significant personnel changes beginning in July with the announcement of new general manager Rich Cho, succeeding former general manager Kevin Pritchard, who was relieved of his duties after the 2010 NBA draft. Cho became the first general manager of Asian descent in NBA history.\n\nOn August 12, the Trail Blazers signed two new assistant general managers, Bill Branch and Steve Rosenberry. Branch and Rosenberry replaced former assistant general manager Tom Penn, who was released by Portland in March.[61] The organization also made changes to Nate McMillan's coaching staff by hiring Bernie Bickerstaff, Bob Ociepka and Buck Williams with Bickerstaff assuming the lead Assistant Coach position due to the departure of Monty Williams.[62]\n\nThe Blazers acquired rookies Armon Johnson, Luke Babbitt, and Elliot Williams from the 2010 NBA draft and off-season trades. On July 21, Wesley Matthews signed a five-year deal with the Blazers after his former team, the Utah Jazz, declined to match their offer.[63]\n\nIn October, former Blazer Maurice Lucas died due to cancer. The 2010–11 Blazers team honored him by wearing No. 20 patches on their jerseys for the season.\n\nIn 2010–11 season, Jeff Pendergraph and rookie guard Elliot Williams both suffered knee injuries that sidelined them for the season; Portland later waived Pendergraph. In November, they announced that Oden would have microfracture surgery on his left knee, ending his 2010–2011 season.[64] This injury marked Oden's third NBA season cut short due to a knee injury. Three-time All-Star Brandon Roy underwent double-arthroscopic surgery on January 17, 2011, to repair both knees after dealing with constant struggles, leaving his future up in the air. Just days after, Marcus Camby also underwent arthroscopic knee surgery to repair his left knee.\n\nDespite struggles with injury, Portland performed at a playoff level throughout the season. LaMarcus Aldridge emerged as the focal point of the team and posted career-high numbers, as well as Western Conference Player of the Week and Month honors. Wesley Matthews also emerged in the absence of Brandon Roy, proving his worth as the Blazers' key off-season addition. Believing the team could make a significant run in the playoffs, Cho executed his first major trade on February 24, 2011, just seven minutes before the deadline. The Trail Blazers sent forward Dante Cunningham, center Joel Przybilla and center Sean Marks to the Charlotte Bobcats in return for former All-Star and All-Defensive forward Gerald Wallace.[65] The emergence of Aldridge and the play of Matthews kept the Blazers competitive, sealing another playoff berth by winning 48 games. However, like in their last two postseasons, the Blazers were eliminated in six games of the first round, this time against the eventual champions, the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nDuring the 2011 off-season, the Blazers released Cho, supposedly due to communication and \"chemistry issues\" with owner Paul Allen. Director of Scouting Chad Buchanan took over as acting interim General Manager. The dismissal of Cho was criticized by Sports Illustrated as \"illogical\", although they noted that Allen had done a lot of questionable moves during his tenure as team owner.[65]\n\nOn June 23, 2011, in the NBA Draft, the Trail Blazers drafted guards Nolan Smith from Duke University with the 21st selection and Jon Diebler from Ohio State University with the 51st selection. On the same day, the Blazers front office had made a three-team trade with the Denver Nuggets and Dallas Mavericks. The trade sent Blazers guards Andre Miller to Denver and Rudy Fernández to Dallas along with international player Petteri Koponen, who had yet to make an appearance for Portland; Denver then sent guard Raymond Felton to Portland and Denver also received rookie forward Jordan Hamilton from Dallas as well as a future second-round pick from Portland.[66]\n\nDue to the 2011 NBA lockout, team transactions were on hold until early December and a shortened 66-game schedule was created. On December 9, 2011, pre-season training camp began along with the free agency market. That morning it was made public that Portland's three-time All-Star guard Brandon Roy would retire due to chronic knee problems. Additionally, center Greg Oden was diagnosed with yet another setback involving his ongoing knee issues. Forward LaMarcus Aldridge, who was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome in 2007, underwent a similar procedure to correct the heart problem after diagnosis earlier that day. Blazers interim GM Chad Buchanan signed three free agents the week before Portland's first exhibition game. On December 11, Portland agreed to terms with veteran forward-center Kurt Thomas to help fill the frontcourt void in the roster. In need of a scoring wingman after the departure of Roy and Fernandez, the Blazers signed 2010 NBA Sixth Man of the Year Winner Jamal Crawford on December 15 by using the new NBA Amnesty Clause on Roy. Later that day, the Blazers signed a third free agent, forward Craig Smith. After getting off to a 7–2 start and recognition as a growing power in the Western Conference, the team quickly began to collapse. Starting point guard Raymond Felton, among others, struggled with McMillan's new approach to a running-style offense. The team gained some notability as Aldridge was named to his first All-Star Game. Despite Aldridge's solid performance, the rest of the team became more inconsistent.\n\nOn March 15, 2012, The Portland Trail Blazers made several moves, including two trades before the 3 pm EST deadline. Center Marcus Camby was sent to the Houston Rockets in exchange for center Hasheem Thabeet and point guard Jonny Flynn. Portland also received Houston's second-round draft pick in the 2012 NBA Draft. Portland then traded forward Gerald Wallace to the New Jersey Nets for center Mehmet Okur, forward Shawne Williams, and New Jersey's first-round, top-3-protected pick in the 2012 NBA draft. All four players acquired in the trades held expiring contracts, meaning they would be free agents at the end of the season. Oden was released from the roster after playing a total of 82 games in five NBA seasons, being cut along with Chris Johnson in order to make room for the incoming traded players. Finally, head coach Nate McMillan was also fired, leaving the franchise with the third-most coaching wins, behind Jack Ramsay and Rick Adelman. Portland named Kaleb Canales as the interim head coach for the rest of the 2011–2012 NBA season. A few days later, Portland claimed forward J. J. Hickson off waivers from the Sacramento Kings. After shaking up the roster and limping to the end of the regular season with a 28–38 record and finishing out of playoff contention for the first time in three years, the team entered the offseason on the search for a general manager and new head coach.\n\nAt the 2012 NBA draft lottery on May 30, the Blazers secured the number 6 pick of the draft via the Brooklyn Nets from the Gerald Wallace trade, and also ended up with the number 11 pick due to their own record.\n\n2012–2023: The Damian Lillard era\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 28, 2012, the Blazers selected Weber State guard Damian Lillard and University of Illinois center Meyers Leonard with the 6th and 11th picks overall, respectively. They also selected University of Memphis guard Will Barton with the 40th pick overall, and traded the rights of the 41st overall pick, University of Kansas guard Tyshawn Taylor, to the Brooklyn Nets for cash considerations.\n\nHeaded by their new general manager Olshey, the Trail Blazers front office further made a few changes during July 2012. The Blazers signed their 30th pick from the 2006 draft, Joel Freeland, and their 22nd pick from the 2009 draft, Víctor Claver,[67] as well as re-signing Hickson[67] and Nicolas Batum.[67] They also signed veteran point guard Ronnie Price to back up Lillard, who was selected as co-MVP of the 2012 Las Vegas Summer League.[68] Dallas Mavericks assistant coach Terry Stotts was hired as head coach on August 7, 2012.[69]\n\nUnder the reins of Lillard, the Blazers played well into January 2013, posting a 20–15 record. On January 11, 2013, at home against the Miami Heat, Wesley Matthews made two consecutive three-pointers late in the fourth quarter to help the Blazers secure a 92–90 victory.[70] However, despite the Blazers remaining among the playoff contenders for most of the season, injuries to starters Batum, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Matthews, as well as a losing streak of 13 games – the longest in the franchise's history – led to the 11th position in the West, with a 33–49 record.[71] Averaging 19.0 points, 6.5 assists, and 3.1 rebounds, Lillard was unanimously named Rookie of the Year, joining Ralph Sampson, David Robinson, and Blake Griffin as the only unanimous selections in NBA history.[72]\n\nGoing into the 2013 NBA draft, the Trail Blazers held four picks: the 10th pick in the first round and three second-round picks. The Blazers selected guard CJ McCollum out of Lehigh University with their 10th pick, and also selected center Jeff Withey from Kansas, power forward Grant Jerrett from Arizona, and Montenegrin big man Marko Todorović.[73] In addition, Cal guard Allen Crabbe was acquired from the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for two second-round picks, in the 2015 and 2016 drafts.[74]\n\nThe Blazers finished the 2014 season with 21 more wins than the previous season, which amounted for the largest single-season improvement in franchise history.[75] This included a period in November when they won 11 straight games, and 13–2 in the month overall, for which coach Terry Stotts took home Coach of the Month honors.[76] On December 12, 2013, Aldridge scored 31 points and pulled down 25 rebounds in a home game against the Rockets, the first time a Trail Blazers' player recorded a 30-point, 25-rebound game.[77] On December 14, 2013, the Blazers made a franchise-record 21 three-pointers against the Philadelphia 76ers.[78] They tied the new record 19 days later against the Charlotte Bobcats, becoming the first NBA team to make 20 or more three-pointers in a game more than once in a season.[79] Lillard was voted in as a reserve to his first All-Star game, joining Aldridge to represent Portland at the game.[80] Portland finished 54–28, securing the fifth seed in the playoffs against the Rockets. The team also shot 81.5% at the free throw line, made 770 three-pointers, and started four players for all 82 regular season games, all franchise records.\n\nThe first-round series against the Rockets was a tight one, with three of the six games going to overtime. The Blazers fared well in the first two games despite not having home-court advantage, beating Houston 122–120 and 112–105 in Games 1 and 2 respectively, fueled by Aldridge's 46 points and 18 rebounds in Game 1, and 43 points and 3 blocks in Game 2. In the sixth game of the series with the Rockets threatening to force a Game 7 back in Houston, down by two points with 0.9 seconds left in the game, Damian Lillard hit a buzzer-beating three-pointer to close out the series (the moment was later nicknamed \"Rip City Revival\", as Portland advanced to the semifinals for the first time since 2000, where they lost to the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in five games).[81]\n\nDuring the 2014 off-season, Olshey signed center Chris Kaman and two-time former Blazers' guard Steve Blake to bolster the bench. Expectations by sportswriters and analysts were high for the Trail Blazers going into the 2015 NBA season given their surprise success in 2013–14.[82][83][84] The Blazers beat the reigning Northwest Division Champion Oklahoma City Thunder, 106–89, in their season opener at home on October 29, 2014. Like the season before, the Trail Blazers dominated the month of November, at one point winning nine straight games from November 9 to 26 before being defeated by the Memphis Grizzlies. Injuries, which had not been significant the previous season, started to inflict themselves on various players. Starting center Lopez fractured his right hand in a game against the Spurs on December 15, 2014, and missed the next 23 games.[85] Initially, the Blazers were much unfazed, winning 129–119 in triple overtime against the Spurs on December 19, a game that saw Lillard and Aldridge combine for 75 points on 29 field goals; Lillard netted a career-high 43 points. Four days later, Lillard hit a three-pointer to tie the game and force overtime against the Thunder en route to 40 points and a 115–111 victory. Three Blazers went to New Orleans for the All Star Weekend: Matthews for the Foot Locker Three-Point Contest, Lillard as a reserve to the All-Star Game, and Aldridge as a starter to the All-Star game.\n\nMore injuries appeared around the start of the new year, which caused Aldridge, Batum, and Joel Freeland to miss various amounts of time, but none greater than Wesley Matthews' season-ending Achilles tendon tear on March 5, 2015. Called \"the heart and soul\" of the team by Aldridge,[86] Matthews was in the midst of a career year when the injury occurred. In the first half of the season, the Blazers had a record of 30–11, allowed opponents to score an average of 97.0 points, and held them to 29.7% shooting on three-pointers; in the second half, the Blazers regressed to a 21–20 record, allowed 100.2 points, and let opponents shoot 37.9% from three. The Blazers clinched a return trip to the playoffs on March 30, 2015, defeating the Phoenix Suns, 109–86. Finishing the season 51–31, they clinched their first Northwest Division title since 1999 but fell to the Grizzlies in five games in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nIn the 2015 NBA draft, the Blazers selected Arizona forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and subsequently traded him to the Brooklyn Nets along with Steve Blake for center Mason Plumlee and the 42nd pick, Pat Connaughton.[87]\n\nAfter losing four of their five starters at the end of the 2015–16 season, the Blazers won 44 games, were the 5th seed in the Western Conference, and beat the Clippers in six games in the first round, but were eliminated by the Golden State Warriors in five games in the Conference Semifinals.\n\nIn May 2017, the team revealed their new logo, an update of the pinwheel design with a new wordmark. According to Chris McGowan, president and CEO of the Trail Blazers, \"Together, we landed on subtle changes that provide a nod to our past while allowing us to modernize other aspects of our creative assets.\"[88]\n\nThe 2017–18 season saw the Blazers finish with the third seed for the first time since the 1999–2000 season. On April 21, 2018, they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the New Orleans Pelicans in a 4–0 sweep.\n\nIn the 2018–19 season, the Blazers finished the regular season 53–29, giving them the third seed in the Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, the Trail Blazers defeated the favored Oklahoma City Thunder in five games, a series which included Damian Lillard's game winning, buzzer beating, 37-foot three-pointer in Game 5, giving them their first playoff series win since 2016.[89][90] In the second round of the playoffs, they faced the Denver Nuggets. The series included a 140–137 Game 3 victory by the Blazers in the first quadruple-overtime game of the NBA playoffs since 1953.[91] The Blazers eventually won the series in seven games and advanced to their first Conference Finals since 2000.[92] In the Western Conference Finals, they faced the two-time defending champion, the Golden State Warriors. However, they lost the series in four games, and were swept.[93]\n\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Blazers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season.[94] They erupted to number 8 but, after winning a \"play-in game\" over Memphis, were eliminated by Lakers in five games in the first round. The NBA decided that, at the end of the regular season part of \"The Bubble\" in Orlando, if the ninth seed was within four games of the eighth seed, the two teams would play at least one game. If the eighth seed won (as the Blazers did), then the play-in was over. If the ninth seed won, then another \"winner-take-all\" game would be played for the eighth seed. The NBA adopted a version of the play-in, a \"tournament\", for the postseason following the 2020–2021 season, which the Blazers avoided by finishing sixth. That play-in tournament returned for the postseason after the 2021–2022 season.[95]\n\nOn June 4, 2021, following a first-round loss in the 2021 NBA playoffs to the Denver Nuggets, the team and head coach Stotts mutually agreed to part ways. After moving on from coach Stotts, the team hired Chauncey Billups as the franchise's next head coach.\n\nOn February 8, 2022, in the midst of a losing season filled with injuries, the Blazers elected to trade CJ McCollum to the New Orleans Pelicans.[96] Without McCollum in the lineup, there was an opportunity for Anfernee Simons to lead the Blazers offense. Simons play for the remainder of the season, earned him a multi-year extension.\n\nOn June 22, 2022, the Blazers received Detroit Pistons forward Jerami Grant in exchange for 2023 and 2025 draft picks.[97]\n\nOn June 23, 2022, in the 2022 NBA draft, the Blazers selected guard Shaedon Sharpe out of the University of Kentucky and forward Jabari Walker from the University of Colorado with the 7th and 57th picks, respectively. In the 2022–23 regular season, the Blazers started well, and at one point were the top seed in the West, but then bit by bit slipped out of playoff contention. Lillard promptly requested a trade on July 1, and Portland began exploring options, though taking their time. General manager Joe Cronin was quoted as saying, \"If it takes months, it takes months.\"\n\nIn the 2023 NBA draft, the Blazers selected guard Scoot Henderson with the third overall pick. Henderson was a standout from the NBA G league team, the NBA G League Ignite.\n\n2023–present: Post-Lillard era\n\n[edit]\n\nOn September 27, 2023, the Blazers acquired Jrue Holiday, Deandre Ayton, and Toumani Camara as part of a trade that sent Lillard to the Milwaukee Bucks and Grayson Allen, Jusuf Nurkić, Nassir Little, and Keon Johnson to the Phoenix Suns. Additionally, the Blazers acquired a 2029 first-round draft pick, with the option to swap with the Bucks for the 2028 and 2030 first-round picks.[98] Four days later, Holiday was traded to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Robert Williams III, Malcolm Brogdon, and two future first-round draft picks.[99]\n\nRivalries\n\n[edit]\n\nThe \"I-5 Rivalry\"\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: I-5 rivalry\n\nThe Seattle SuperSonics were the traditional rivals of the Blazers. Due to the proximity of the teams, the rivalry had been dubbed the \"I-5 Rivalry\" in reference to the Interstate 5 freeway that connects the two cities. Many fans made the trip up to Seattle for the games, with Seattle fans making the trek down to Portland for their games. The rivalry was fairly equal in accomplishments, with both teams winning one championship each. The all-time record of this rivalry ended at 98–94 in favor of the SuperSonics.\n\nTrail Blazers vs. The Oregonian\n\n[edit]\n\nRelations between the team and The Oregonian have often been tense; the paper is editorially independent of the team and is often critical. During the Steve Patterson era, relations between the two institutions became increasingly hostile; several NBA executives told ESPN's Chris Sheridan that the situation was the \"most dysfunctional media-team relationship\" that they could recall.[100] Much of the hostility started after an incident in which forward Darius Miles called coach Maurice Cheeks an ethnic slur in 2005, and was suspended for two games, a number many fans considered to be insufficient.[101] A proposed agreement was negotiated behind the scenes between the team and the player to refund much of his fine provided he drop appeals to the players' union. Details of this agreement were leaked to Oregonian columnist John Canzano,[102] who reported the existence of the agreement in his column, criticizing the team for its apparent duplicity.[103] The Trail Blazers denied that such an agreement was in the works, at which point the paper published the leaked memo online;[100] the team would later claim that the memo came from Miles' agent.[101]\n\nThe relationship between the paper and the team continued to deteriorate over the following year.[100] In May 2006, the team instituted a new policy requiring that it be permitted to record all interviews of team players and staff, including the right to post transcripts or recordings on the team website.[104] Prior to the 2006 NBA draft, a group of reporters was invited to a pre-draft workout the team was holding. During a portion of the workout which was closed to the media, an Oregonian reporter looked through a curtain separating the press from the workout, and observed Gonzaga University star Adam Morrison, then considered a likely draft prospect for the team, playing poorly; he wrote about this on his blog.[105] The team was outraged, and published a scathing criticism of Jason Quick on its website, closing subsequent practices to the press altogether.[106] John Canzano responded with outrage on this blog, called the team \"paranoid\", and referred to Art Sasse, the Blazers' VP of communications, as a \"henchman\" and \"Steve Patterson's personal bootlicker\".[107] Henry Abbott of ESPN blog TrueHoop commented that the team had gone \"off the deep end\", noting that \"[t]here has never been a team of any kind, in the history of eternity, that won over the public while declaring war on the reporters covering the team.\"[108]\n\nIn November 2006, the Oregonian commissioned an outside editor, Craig Lancaster of the San Jose Mercury-News, to investigate the deteriorating relationship between the paper and the team's management,[109] a move the rival Willamette Week called \"unusual\".[110] In the report,[111] Lancaster criticized both sides somewhat, but did not make any revelations which were unexpected.[110] Canzano referred to the piece as \"ill conceived\" and a \"waste of space\"; the team found the article unsatisfying as well.[110]\n\nFan support and \"Blazermania\"\n\n[edit]\n\nTrail Blazers regular-season\n\nattendance figures, 1970–2023[112][113] Season Total Average No. of games Notes 1970–71 245,383 6,135 41 Inaugural season 1971–72 279,506 6,988 41 1972–73 333,480 8,134 41 1973–74 327,495 7,988 41 1974–75 441,506 10,768 41 First season with Bill Walton 1975–76 413,992 10,097 41 1976–77 499,302 12,178 41 Won NBA title; Sellout streak started. 1977–78 519,306 12,666 41 Won Pacific Division 1978–79 519,306 12,666 41 1979–80 519,306 12,666 41 1980–81 519,306 12,666 41 1981–82 519,306 12,666 41 1982–83 519,306 12,666 41 1983–84 519,306 12,666 41 First season with Clyde Drexler 1984–85 519,306 12,666 41 1985–86 519,306 12,666 41 1986–87 519,306 12,666 41 1987–88 519,306 12,666 41 1988–89 527,008 12,854 41 Seating added to Memorial Coliseum 1989–90 528,244 12,884 41 Advanced to NBA Finals 1990–91 528,244 12,884 41 Won Pacific Division 1991–92 528,408 12,888 41 Won Pacific Division; Advanced to NBA Finals 1992–93 528,408 12,888 41 1993–94 528,408 12,888 41 1994–95 529,759 12,921 41 Includes attendance for one game played in Yokohama, Japan[114] 1995–96 850,338 20,740 41 First season in Rose Garden; Sellout streak ends 1996–97 852,799 20,800 41 1997–98 843,647 20,577 41 1998–99 486,556 19,462 25 Lockout-shortened season; Won Pacific Division; Advanced to Western Finals 1999–00 835,078 20,368 41 Advanced to Western Finals 2000–01 831,376 20,277 41 2001–02 797,821 19,459 41 2002–03 796,258 19,421 41 50 wins 2003–04 684,038 16,684 41 No playoffs (41–41 record) 2004–05 680,374 16,594 41 No playoffs (27–55 record); RG bankruptcy filed 2005–06 617,199 15,053 41 No playoffs; NBA's worst record (21–61) 2006–07 670,778 16,360 41 First season with Brandon Roy and LaMarcus Aldridge; No playoffs 2007–08 801,566 19,550 41 Greg Oden (#1 selection) injured for the whole season 2008–09 841,499 20,524 41 Team marketing changes to reflect the entire Pacific Northwest; loses archrival team. 2009–10 840,411 20,497 41 2010–11 840,924 20,510 41 2011–12 676,384 20,496 33 Lockout-shortened season 2012–13 813,012 19,829 41 First season with Damian Lillard 2013–14 809,612 19,746 41 First season with CJ McCollum 2014–15 801,733 19,554 41 Won Northwest Division 2015–16 794,085 19,367 41 2016–17 792,029 19,317 41 2017–18 795,328 19,398 41 Won Northwest Division 2018–19 799,345 19,496 41 Death of owner Paul Allen; Advanced to Western Finals 2019–20 608,634 19,633 36 Season shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic 2020–21 7,756 1,939 36 Minimal fans allowed to attend due to COVID-19 2021–22 705,608 17,209 41 2022–23 767,374 18,716 41\n\nThe relationship between the team and its fans, commonly known as \"Blazermania\", has been well-chronicled. The Trail Blazers have long been one of the NBA's top draws, with the exception of two periods in the team's history. The team drew poorly during its first four seasons of existence, failing to average more than 10,000 spectators per game. Attendance increased in 1974, when the team drafted Bill Walton.[115]\n\nThe phenomenon known as Blazermania started during the 1976–1977 season, when the team posted its first winning record, made its first playoff appearance, and captured its only NBA title, defeating the heavily favored Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA Finals; the team has been wildly popular in Portland since that time.[10][116] That season, the team started their sellout streak which continued until the team moved into the Rose Garden in 1995.[117] The team continued to average over 19,000 spectators per game until the 2003–04 season.\n\nAttendance declined significantly in the 2003–04 season, as the team continued to suffer image problems due to the \"Jail Blazer\" reputation it had gained, and was no longer competitive on the court.[28] Writing for the New York Times, NBA columnist Chris Broussard remarked that Blazermania was \"dead\".[118] A series of management miscues, including the Rose Garden arena bankruptcy, took a further toll on attendance, and the team posted two straight seasons with less than thirty wins, including the worst campaign of the 2005–06 NBA season with 21 wins and 61 losses.[119] After drafting eventual Rookie of the Year Brandon Roy in 2006, attendance climbed a bit in the 2006–07 season, as the team was more competitive and posted a 32–50 record. Many expected that the selection of Greg Oden in the 2007 NBA draft would cause attendance to increase.[120] Prior to his season-ending knee surgery, season ticket sales were markedly up. Even with Oden on crutches on the sideline, the team's 2007–08 home opener, a 93–90 victory over the New Orleans Hornets, was a sellout.[121] The season culminated in 32 sold-out home games, of which the final 27 home games were consecutive sell-outs.\n\nList of coaches\n\n[edit]\n\nThe complete list of Trail Blazers' head coaches, and their tenures, is as follows:[122]\n\nRolland Todd, 1970–1972\n\nStu Inman, 1972 (interim)\n\nJack McCloskey, 1972–1974\n\nLenny Wilkens, 1974–1976\n\nDr. Jack Ramsay, 1976–1986\n\nMike Schuler, 1986–1989\n\nRick Adelman, 1989 (interim), 1989–1994\n\nP.

Two former UNLV men's basketball coaches, Bill Bayno and Tim Grgurich, have served on the Blazers' coaching staff.\n\nRecords vs. opponents\n\n[edit]\n\nUpdated through January 7, 2024.[123][124]\n\nTeam Regular Season Games Regular Season W Regular Season L W / L % Postseason Atlanta Hawks 122 61 61 .500 - Boston Celtics 122 49 73 .402 - Brooklyn Nets 97 68 29 .701 - Charlotte Hornets 65 47 18 .723 - Chicago Bulls 132 67 65 .508 4–5 (.444) Cleveland Cavaliers 132 73 59 .553 - Dallas Mavericks 175 90 85 .514 11–9 (.550) Denver Nuggets 195 102 93 .544 11–12 (.478) Detroit Pistons 126 71 55 .563 1–4 (.200) Golden State Warriors 245 130 115 .531 1–12 (.077) Houston Rockets 210 96 114 .457 8–12 (.400) Indiana Pacers 99 61 38 .616 - Los Angeles Clippers 240 148 92 .617 4–2 (.667) Los Angeles Lakers 243 114 129 .469 17–36 (.321) Memphis Grizzlies 103 57 46 .553 1–4 (.200) Miami Heat 69 42 27 .609 - Milwaukee Bucks 134 53 81 .396 - Minnesota Timberwolves 131 90 41 .687 3–1 (.750) New Orleans Pelicans 72 37 35 .514 0–4 (.000) New York Knicks 121 70 51 .584 - Oklahoma City Thunder 252 120 132 .476 12–9 (.571) Orlando Magic 68 40 28 .588 - Philadelphia 76ers 122 59 63 .484 4–2 (.667) Phoenix Suns 243 112 131 .461 16–15 (.516) Sacramento Kings 228 141 87 .627 1–2 (.333) San Antonio Spurs 186 92 94 .495 6–14 (.300) Toronto Raptors 54 34 20 .630 - Utah Jazz 207 93 114 .449 19–12 (.613) Washington Wizards 122 64 58 .525 - 4,315 2,281 2,034 .529 119-155 (.434)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"

The company has been involved in various sectors, including technology, sports, and real estate, and has played a significant role in Allen's philanthropic efforts, particularly in conservation and education. Following Allen's death in October 2018, his sister, Jody Allen, took over the leadership of Vulcan Inc. and continues to oversee its operations and philanthropic initiatives [(Nostalgia Nerd, 2025-01-05)](https://www.nostalgianerd.com/this-tiny-2k-computer-is-nuts/).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Acquisitions and Investments\n\nVulcan Capital, the investment arm of Vulcan Inc., has been active in funding various companies, including Rad Power Bikes, which received a $25 million funding round led by Vulcan Capital in February 2020. This investment was part of a larger trend where Rad Power has raised a total of $329 million, making it the best-funded direct-to-consumer e-bike company globally [(Bicycle Retailer, 2025-03-13)](https://www.bicycleretailer.com/industry-news/2025/03/13/rad-power-names-kathi-lentzsch-new-ceo).\n\n### Philanthropic Efforts\n\nVulcan Inc. has been involved in significant conservation projects, including a $7 million study on elephant populations in Africa, which revealed a 30% decline in savanna elephants between 2007 and 2014. This study was funded in part by Paul Allen's organization and involved collaboration with over 90 scientists and multiple NGOs [(Sierra Club, 2024-07-31)](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2016-5-september-october/green-life/elephant-populations-decline-30-percent).\n\n### Auction of Historic Computers\n\nIn 2023, items from Paul Allen's extensive collection of historic computers were auctioned, with proceeds aimed at furthering his philanthropic mission. This collection included significant milestones in computing history, reflecting Allen's passion for technology and innovation [(I Programmer, 2025-03-24)](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/82-heritage/17430-paul-allens-enigma-machine-under-the-hammer.html).\n\n## Company Scale\n\nVulcan Inc. operates with a diverse portfolio, but specific employee numbers and revenue figures are not publicly disclosed. The company has been involved in various high-profile projects and investments, indicating a substantial operational scale. The company’s influence is particularly notable in the sports sector, as it owns the Portland Trail Blazers, a professional NBA team [(Wikipedia, 2006-11-12)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Portland_Trail_Blazers).\n\n## Executive Leadership\n\nJody Allen currently leads Vulcan Inc. following her brother's passing. She has been involved in the company's operations and philanthropic efforts, ensuring that Allen's legacy continues. The leadership transition has been crucial in maintaining the company's direction and focus on philanthropy and innovation [(I Programmer, 2025-03-24)](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/82-heritage/17430-paul-allens-enigma-machine-under-the-hammer.html).\n\n## Product Overview\n\n### Vulcan Inc. as a Product\n\nVulcan Inc. itself is not a product in the traditional sense but rather a corporate entity that manages investments and philanthropic initiatives. Its \"products\" can be seen as the various projects and companies it supports, including technology ventures, conservation efforts, and sports management.\n\n### Notable Projects\n\n1. **Rad Power Bikes**: A significant investment that has positioned Vulcan Capital as a key player in the e-bike market.\n   \n2. **Conservation Initiatives**: Funding for studies and projects aimed at wildlife conservation, particularly elephants in Africa.\n\n3. **Historic Computer Collection**: The auction of Allen's collection highlights the company's commitment to preserving and promoting the history of technology.\n\n## Opinions and Sentiment\n\nVulcan Inc. has generally been viewed positively due to its philanthropic efforts and contributions to technology and sports. However, there have been criticisms regarding the management of the Portland Trail Blazers, particularly concerning the team's performance and leadership decisions. Clyde Drexler, a former player, has expressed dissatisfaction with the team's management, particularly targeting Bert Kolde, a key figure in the organization [(Blazers Edge, 2024-07-31)](https://www.blazersedge.com/2024/7/31/24209769/portland-trail-blazers-sale-rumors-jody-allen-nba-tv-rights-deal-broadcast-amount-vulcan-inc-paul).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVulcan Inc. remains a significant player in various sectors, driven by its commitment to innovation and philanthropy.
