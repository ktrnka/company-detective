We employ Targeting Cookies with Google Analytics. For more information about how Google Analytics uses cookies, please review the Google Analytics Cookie Guide.\n\nTags: We use third-party JavaScript tags (code elements), to set the Performance Cookies. We manage the tags using Google Tag Manager, which is a tag management tool that integrates with Google Analytics to derive usage statistics and performance analytics.\n\nIn order to provide the Site, VRE may use and share Aggregate Data collected through the cookies with third parties. For example, Google Web Tools interact with other Google Inc. products and services in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy. Please see the section below on “Managing Your Information” for ways to manage how your information is shared via Google Web Tools.\n\nHow Your Information is Used\n\nPlease see below on the circumstances where VRE may share your personal information with others without further notice, obligation or liability to you:\n\nService Providers: VRE may use third-party providers to provide or support some of the services that are available through the Site, including without limitation, communications and hosting services, network security, technical and user support, tracking and reporting, quality assurance testing, and other functions. VRE may share your information with these third-party providers so that they can perform their services or complete your requests. These third-party providers may share information with VRE that they obtain from or about you in connection with providing their services or completing your requests. Third-party providers may also share this information with their subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control.\n\nBusiness Transfers: VRE may share your information with its affiliated entities, prospective buyers, partners or joint ventures, in which case VRE will require them to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires VRE or all or substantially all of its assets (e.g. merger, acquisition or sale), that company will possess the same information, and will assume the rights and obligations with respect to that information as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nInvestigations: VRE may investigate and disclose your personal information if it has a good faith belief that such disclosure (a) is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on VRE; (b) is helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible fraud wrongdoing in connection with the Site; (c) is necessary to act under exigent circumstances to protect the safety of the public or users of the Site, or (d) is reasonably necessary to protect VRE’s rights, reputation, property, or that of its users, affiliates, partners or the public.\n\nLinks: The Site may contain links to unaffiliated third-party services. If you visit any websites through those links, the collection and use of your information will be subject to such third party’s terms and privacy policy. Unless there is a separate basis for sharing your information as expressly set forth in this Privacy Policy, VRE will not share your personal information with these third parties and is not responsible for their privacy practices. VRE will not be liable for any loss or damage that may be incurred as a result of accessing or using any third-party links through the Site.\n\nManaging Your Information\n\nCookie Settings\n\nYou may manage your cookies at any time through the cookie settings on the Site. Please note that if you change your settings to opt out of receiving cookies, it will not retroactively delete or remove any previously collected information, but it will prevent your information from being shared through such cookies from that point on.\n\nWithin the US: If the Site detects that your IP address is from a location within the United States, you will be prompted to accept or reject cookies when you first visit the platform. If you accept, you accept all of the cookies specified in the “Cookies” section above. If you take no action, you will be deemed as having accepted the cookies. If you opt out, you will be directed to a settings page where you can select which cookies to opt out of receiving. You cannot, however, opt out of Strictly Necessary Cookies, but you can configure your browser settings to block or alert you about them. If you block Strictly Necessary Cookies, some parts of the Site will have degraded performance or will not work. You can turn off cookies in your browser settings at any time, and delete previously saved cookies and other browsing data by clearing your browsing data and history.\n\nOutside of the US: If the Site detects that your IP address is from a location outside of the United States, all of the same apply as above, except if you take no action to accept or reject cookies, you will be deemed as having rejected the cookies.\n\nGoogle Web Tools\n\nYou can manage how your information is shared and used with Google Web Tools as follows:\n\nGoogle Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on: Google has developed a browser add-on tool to enable visitors of websites with Google cookies and tags to prevent Google Analytics from receiving their information. This add-on will not prevent websites from collecting information through other first party or third-party cookies and tags. You can download and install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to begin using this tool.\n\nGoogle Settings: In addition to above, you can manage how Google uses the information obtained through Google Web Tools and other cookies, and how it interacts with other Google products by changing the settings in your Google account. For example, you can restrict personalization features used in Google ads by changing your preference settings in your Google account to prevent use for targeted ads and content. Please review Google’s Privacy Controls for more general information on how you can configure various privacy and share settings through Google.\n\nThird-Party Tools: Third parties have also developed mechanisms for opting out of various cookies that use and share information collected from Google Web Tools and other sources for advertising purposes. For US-based users, the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) WebChoices is a tool that enables you to view and manage the cookies used for online advertising. For EU-based users, there is Your Online Choices.\n\nCompliance\n\nInformation collected from the Site will be stored and processed in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States and visit the Site, you permit us to transfer your information outside of your country.\n\nSecurity\n\nVRE is committed to protecting the security of your information and follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information it receives. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, devices, or cloud or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while VRE strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, VRE cannot guarantee its absolute security.\n\nPersonal Information of Children\n\nThe Site is intended for a general audience, and VRE does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you become aware that a child has provided VRE with personal information without parental consent, please contact VRE at [email protected]. If VRE becomes aware that a child under 16 has provided personal information without parental consent, VRE will take steps to delete such data as soon as possible without notice.\n\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\n\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) effective as of January 1, 2020 is a law that protects the privacy rights of California residents by putting certain requirements on how businesses collect and use personal information. VRE is committed to take the necessary measures to protect your personal information and comply with the CCPA as the specific requirements and application of the rules continue to develop over time. As part of this commitment, the cookie settings are available for you to change your settings any time.\n\nEuropean Union (EU) Residents: Your Privacy Rights Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n\nIf you are located in the EU, we will collect personal information only if VRE has one or more legal bases for doing so under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The legal bases depend on your interaction with the Site. VRE will only collect personal information from you where: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; (ii) it is necessary to perform a contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you; (iii) it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests; (iv) it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or another natural person; or (v) it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.\n\nData Subject Rights\n\nYou can submit a request regarding your personal information through the Data Subject Access Request Form. To submit the form, you must provide certain information such as your first name, last name and email address, your relationship to VRE, and details about your request. VRE will only use the information you provide to evaluate, process, fulfill or contact you regarding your request (e.g. to follow up or ask for additional details about your request). VRE will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to your request as soon as possible.

      "# [Vulcan Tech Dev Blog — From Logbooks to Web Consoles: The Tech Behind DAS by vulcantech on 2016-12-22](https://techblog.vulcan.com/post/154821633396/from-logbooks-to-web-consoles-the-tech-behind-das)\nOn the Philanthropic Technology team at Vulcan, we collaborate with other organizations to identify and solve some of the big problems facing our world. One major initiative we’ve focused on recently is the Domain Awareness Project, also known as DAS, where we are collaborating with conservationists in Africa to protect elephants. DAS complements another of our key initiatives to safeguard this species, described in a previous tech blog: Technology for the Great Elephant Census.\n\nAll of the conservation area teams we talked to are using logbooks to record incidents and animal movements. These logbooks are used both as a reference and to compile monthly reports. Those monthly reports are then compiled into annual reports developed to inform the boards of these conservation areas about what occurred over the year. Typically, all of this information was then placed on a physical shelf to collect dust.\n\nCommunications from rangers in the field went into similar logbooks. Some organizations augmented these paper systems with rudimentary database systems written in MS Access or built in complex spreadsheets. We all agreed there was a nee to consolidate and make this information more easily accessible to their entire organizations in near real-time.\n\nSave the Elephants, or STE, is a research and conservation organization based in Kenya. STE pioneered the use of elephant collars to record and analyze elephant movements. We have been collaborating with STE on other projects and were familiar with their tracking platform. Through discussions with them and others, their tracking platform became the genesis for DAS. Working with STE, we have incorporated their animal-tracking expertise with new functionality to record the data streams typically found in conservation areas. This project culminated in the DAS platform, which provides conservation area managers with a tool to visualize and monitor their animals, rangers, and related incidents.\n\nIn our first minimal viable product, or MVP, of DAS, we first collected animal-collar tracking information and displayed it on a website. Next, we added security so users were limited to which animals they could access and how much of the tracking they could view. We have also worked with several handheld radio platform makers that rangers carry in the field. With the integration of ranger radios, it allows the conservation area managers to contact them and coordinate ranger movements.\n\nOn the same map we use to visualize animal and ranger movements, we also show reports of incidents. The radio operator receives calls about incidents and enters these reports directly in DAS. These are communications of status or occurrences sent in from the field. In the military, the base report is known as a situational report or sitrep. Our technology allows the radio operator to enter these sitreps directly into DAS which in most cases includes a location for visualization on the map.\n\nAbove is an example image of the DAS web console. (Note: This is an example conservation area, not a real place.) On the left is the big map showing the location of the elephants and their tracks. On the right is the list of incoming reports. Not shown is the map layers tab that allows the user to see or hide different user interface elements, such as the reports, animals, rangers, or geographic points of interest.\n\nIn addition to the sitreps, there was other data we needed to incorporate, such as human wildlife conflict, or HWC, reports. A HWC report records a ranger in contact with a person of concern. Additionally, a vehicle report describes a vehicle of interest, such as car or truck that is not supposed to be in the conservation area.\n\nBased on these different report types, we investigated several ideas, including having many tables in the database or one wide table with many empty fields. We looked at entity-attribute-value – EAV – pairs. Using EAV works in some cases, but the downside for us was the extra work to query the data. We needed to address custom report data storage while also considering how the user interface (UI) would render it. We discovered an open standard called JSON Schema that looked interesting, and there was a validation implementation available in Python. We also found an Angular Forms implementation for rendering the user interface. We chose PostgreSQL, which includes JSON support at the field level. Using JSON Schema to define the custom report data, then rendering it using existing libraries allowed us to quickly support custom reports for our initial sites.\n\nDAS is built on the Django Web Framework and is written in Python. We use PostgreSQL and PostGIS for storing and accessing data. Various open source-based GIS libraries, including GDAL, PyProj, Shapely and Fiona, are used to analyze movement data. Django Rest Framework provides our restful API. Additionally, we have used a SocketIO library to support real-time updates to our single web page app. Our visualization consists of a single page Angular web app, specifically using MapBox and Leaflet technology for the map render piece. Redis rounds out our infrastructure to provide queuing and real-time communication coordination.\n\nDuring development, we used AWS RDS and ElasticCache to host our PostgreSQL and Redis services respectively. ElasticBeanstalk provides an easy to configure almost all-in-one pipeline. For production, we need to have the ability to deploy on-premise as well as in the cloud and have moved to using Chef to coordinate this type of deployment.\n\nWe have DAS installed at two conservation areas so far with plans for another to go live in January 2017."

      "# Post ID 1apmpn4: sad that living computers: museum + labs is still closed but feeling a bit of hope! with +88 score by [(skyscapeparadise, Reddit, 2024-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1apmpn4/sad_that_living_computers_museum_labs_is_still/)\nWhen the Living Computers museum closed during the pandemic, several other Vale Group (formerly Vulcan Inc.) museums/public spaces closed as well including the Cinerama and the Flying Heritage Collection. It seemed as though none of these spaces would ever be open to the public again as the priorities of Vale Group appeared to be shifting away from these projects. However, given that both the Cinerama and the Flying Heritage Collection have been sold off to new owners who have reopened them, I'm hoping that Living Computers can meet this positive fate as well. I never had the opportunity to visit LCM+L since I had only recently moved to Washington at the time. Most people don't care about old computers but being someone who is really interested in history and technology, the thought of being able to try out a Xerox Alto or a PDP-11 or an Apple I seems incredible! It makes me sad that this one-of-a-kind resource has been in limbo, but my hope is that Vale is in the process of selling the museum to an owner who will give it the care and attention it deserves. I haven't given up the dream of being able to visit this museum!\n\n## Comment ID kq7dj58 with +20 score by [(aerothorn, Reddit, 2024-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1apmpn4/sad_that_living_computers_museum_labs_is_still/kq7dj58/) (in reply to ID 1apmpn4):\nIt's a fantastic museum, I am not holding my breath on it reopening but I hope with you.

It seemed like every time she came to the business, she was a major pain in the ass, making demands of people, etc.  When Paul Allen was in the building, we were all sort of instructed to avoid him.  He would come in for meetings and leave and talk only to people he needed to talk to.  I was told that Jody walked around the building basically harassing people.\n\nAlso, I was peripherally connected to a person who was one air crew of Paul Allen's planes and he said that Jody Allen's kids were all a bunch of entitled brats.

He wasn’t a football guy (more of a basketball fan) but he bought the Seahawks so they wouldn’t leave Seattle. He bought and kept open a lotta local little historical places like a computer museum and the cinerama. He also had a very hands on approach to the Seahawks where the community trusted his leadership. He definitely had points of conflict with the community, people either loved or hated his Seattle Commons idea to build a Central Park using the cities money but his land (people thought he should fund it himself and pointed out he was developing all the surrounding land) and his rich neighbors got annoyed the way he treated Lake Washington as his own personal pond (tho the stories are just funny to everyone else). However, ultimately Paul’s behavior made him someone people looked up to and that’s not the same for Jody. She’s been shutting down his program and has shown disinterest in properties like the Seahawks.

They do love the Blazers and Timbers, and sport is huge in the state in general.\n\nThe Portland metro area is probably large and wealthy enough. I feel like NHL hockey would have appeal as something new and different, which kind of fits with the eclectic attitude of the city, and the a lot of the state for that matter. \n\nThe biggest unknown is if there's enough interest to go around between the Blazers and the NHL. I just never knew anyone, friends, or co-workers, that had ever even given hockey a single thought. It would be a pretty raw market to develop fans in—similar to Vegas imo. A lot of fans would support the team because it's a Portland pro sports team and not because it's hockey.\n\n### Comment ID e1k94dz with +4 score by [(RoloTamassi, Reddit, 2018-06-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/8v1y5y/do_you_think_that_portland_could_support_an_nhl/e1k94dz/) (in reply to ID e1jwwzy):\nAlso from the GTA (Guelph represent) living in Portland.

That gives it a bigger population than the metro areas supporting the Jets, Sabres, Hurricanes, Oilers, Senators, Flames, Predators, Blue Jackets, Golden Knights, and Penguins.\n\nPortland is certainly big enough to support a team, the question is if it would do so. Atlanta is the 10th largest metropolitan area in the United States and Canada, with a metro population of 5.79 million, yet the NHL failed to keep a team in Atlanta *twice* (the Flames were there from 1972 to 1980, and the Thrashers were there from 1999 to 2011). \n\nCould it? Yes. Would it? No clue.\n\n### Comment ID e1k21o8 with +13 score by [(sweetplantveal, Reddit, 2018-06-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/8v1y5y/do_you_think_that_portland_could_support_an_nhl/e1k21o8/) (in reply to ID e1jxy3u):\nFun fact, the Calgary hockey team is named after the Civil War burning of Atlanta 🌟💫\n\n### Comment ID e1k5g31 with +4 score by [(ramrob, Reddit, 2018-06-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/8v1y5y/do_you_think_that_portland_could_support_an_nhl/e1k5g31/) (in reply to ID e1jxy3u):\nI have no facts to back this up but I live here in Portland and I think think this city would go mad over an NHL team.

We've seen via Vegas how tremendously well an expansion/relocation can do even outside a \"traditional hockey market\" with the right plan.  But none of that is guaranteed.

This makes people dislike the idea more knowing that much money is going somewhere else, and the council doesn't want a new arena built (the mayor has vowed to  build as much \"affordable housing\" as he can).

I've also seen them on green ways with bike paths right next to them. So awesome!\n\nBut I saw the street car in south lake union (the SLUT) the other day stuck behind an unoccupied car that had parked too far out into the lane and was blocking the tracks. The street car just had to sit there indefinitely whereas a bus could just go around easily. Additionally the street car is subject to traffic lights and typical traffic...and it seems to take a long time to build and a lot of money to install. To me, the street car in Seattle is basically just a big bus that's subject to a track. \n\nSo if it's not gonna be in a dedicated travel lane or space, why have street cars at all?

The high construction costs meant the streetcars couldn't travel anywhere far.\n\nCompared to the BRT (lite) routes which have become much more useful in Seattle itself and say in Oakland's BRT, Richmond VA's BRT, etc.. which have had much better ridership and also with the vastly cheaper construction costs been able to reach much more useful destinations than being a 1/2 mile neighborhood loop.\n\nThat being said, I will note that the dedicated transit lane on Westlake the 40 and C bus use were basically only achieved because of the streetcar. (Note that means a lot of other bus routes can be improved by bus lanes, not to spend streetcar money just to get one dedicated lane)\n\nAlso fun fact back in 2015\n\n[https://seattletransitblog.com/2015/12/04/sound-transit-presents-st3-options/](https://seattletransitblog.com/2015/12/04/sound-transit-presents-st3-options/)\n\n**Option C1D** is the “Westlake Rapid Streetcar” option\n\nOne of the options for the Ballard link extension was actually to extend the South Lake Union Streetcar up Westlake through Fremont then to Ballard. Not sure if actually a good idea as it would encounter a lot more intersections, but it was theoretically only 25 minutes to travel to ballard from sodo compared to 18 minutes so a bit longer.\n\n\n\n### Comment ID iclcrm2 with +1 score by [(bobtehpanda, Reddit, 2022-06-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/iclcrm2/) (in reply to ID ic9jffz):\nIf you put it next to the bike path it wouldn’t actually have to deal with many intersections.\n\n#### Comment ID icleikn with +1 score by [(reflect25, Reddit, 2022-06-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/icleikn/) (in reply to ID iclcrm2):\nFor Option C1D, along Westlake Ave N from SLU to Fremont there aren't actually that many intersections so it wouldn't be much of an issue.

Busses usually cost more than a street car, are less energy efficient, and less dense with riders. Street cars have a psychological benefit of a sense of permanency that busses don't which tend to spur more business investment along the route than would happen with a new bus route. So economically, streetcars *tend* to be cheaper over a longer period.\n\nStreet cars have some soft benefits over busses as well such as being more easily understood, more comfortable, quieter, environmentally cleaner, spend less time at stops and more time moving, and are usually have better ridership.\n\nThat being said busses are great too. Relatively they're extremely cheap and quick to deploy. Cities can throw up new bus routes with decent stops in almost no time and very little upfront capital. Streetcar extensions take at least 5 years, often times getting as high as 15 years and cost a fortune upfront.\n\nMy opinion is that the city be focusing on deploying bus routes heavily across the city while simultaneously working on street car extensions in the most dense areas. As new street car routes come online, move the busses serving that route elsewhere or retire them if they're end-of-life, which with how long street car extensions take they very well may be.\n\n## Comment ID ic908cx with +106 score by [(HistorianOrdinary390, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic908cx/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nCars need a swift and harsh lesson that, no, they are not entitled to every inch of road in the city.\n\nBan cars from more streets, make more dedicated space for transit and alternative forms of transit.\n\nReduce the burden of SOVs so that those who *must* use them can do so with less traffic and those that have the option and mobility find transit to be just as good if not better.\n\n### Comment ID ic99nan with +42 score by [(AdultingGoneMild, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic99nan/) (in reply to ID ic908cx):\nremoving parking for cars along street car routes makes sense to me. open that space for bikes\n\n#### Comment ID ic9dy1f with +20 score by [(ALLoftheFancyPants, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic9dy1f/) (in reply to ID ic99nan):\nBike lanes next to streetcar tracks are very much  not ideal.

If the streetcar was not traveling on surface streets and did not have to deal with auto traffic (e.g. monorail or lightrail) you *might* be able to justify it, but as it stands it doesn't make economic sense.\n\n### Comment ID icbdxoa with +2 score by [(5yearsago, Reddit, 2022-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/icbdxoa/) (in reply to ID ic97xif):\n> The upside of the streetcar is that (for whatever reason) it appears \"classier\" than a bus. \n\nIt has much bigger interior volume, bigger window area, it's much quieter and the ride is smooth, also there is no exhaust.   \nOf course it's classier.\n\n### Comment ID ic9f1lb with +3 score by [(Rumpullpus, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic9f1lb/) (in reply to ID ic97xif):\nit will make more sense when diesel starts to hit $9+ a gallon.\n\n#### Comment ID ic9naps with +15 score by [(EmmEnnEff, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic9naps/) (in reply to ID ic9f1lb):\nTrolleybuses running off power-line electricity are a 140-year-old technology.\n\nI think we can figure something out.\n\n#### Comment ID ic9j3jj with +14 score by [(moleculewerks, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic9j3jj/) (in reply to ID ic9f1lb):\nNot really.

Load/unload times that are a bit faster don't mean much when someone can walk faster than taking the street car in the first place. So that leaves us with tourists being more likely to use them. \n\nIn other words, they are fancy vanity projects that benefit nearby businesses, at best. They are absolutely not \"mass transit\". A bus would have been faster, cheaper, and had higher passenger counts. Bonus points in that it would also be flexible in routing.\n\nNow if only sites like The Urbanist could figure out what you just did and not just blindly support these things with the \"if it isn't a car, I like it\" mantra, I would take them a bit more seriously.\n\n### Comment ID icd10n0 with +2 score by [(-shrug-, Reddit, 2022-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/icd10n0/) (in reply to ID ic9gsik):\nThe fixed routing can be an advantage - when a city has fluctuating levels of support for buses/transit, bus routes are vulnerable to moving frequently so a fixed route trolley convinces people that it's a longterm commitment and increases housing and business development along the route.

A streetcar can in theory move more people than an articulated bus since it can have multiple cars.

Also weird the way people are derogatorily using \"urbanist.\"\n\nI think any incidental failing of transit will be used as an excuse to crucify the whole system. People who are concerned about their lifestyle, especially when that lifestyle revolves around a car, feel threatened by talk of expanding transit and closing off areas from cars. Obviously, this prevents progress.\n\nTangentially, it's incredible how some people will mock gun enthusiasts but turn around and try to hang onto cars. \"Muh guns\" turns into \"muh subaru,\" but people don't see the irony in that they're defending the deadlier machine. Personally, I'm not big on either. \n\nThat might be a little too meta though, so to directly answer your question OP, Seattle's implementation of streetcars has been pretty lackluster. This is in part due to the programs being gutted by NIMBYs and likely exacerbated by the number of cars on the road. \n\nI'm not sure where in SLU this happened but ideally streetcar lines should run down the center of the street, with car lanes on either side, and parking should always be at least a lane or two away from the streetcar. The situation you described shouldn't happen with proper implementation. \n\nBusses certainly have a number of advantages over streetcars, especially the more environmentally friendly electrified buses. Like you said, they have more mobility options, and it's easier to reroute things if there's construction or an accident or so on. A lot of buses also fit people more efficiently than a streetcar.  \n\nBut on the other hand, buses destroy their own infrastructure very quickly, have longer boarding/offloading times, and are harder to automate. \n\nI think the ultimate answer to transit in Seattle is to use both. Buses can serve more far-flung areas and bring people in and out of the city center, while streetcars should be used to connect major destinations within the city.\n\n## Comment ID icbvm6x with +3 score by [(marssaxman, Reddit, 2022-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/icbvm6x/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nSeattle did not build the South Lake Union Trolley because it made sense as part of a comprehensive transit network.

(https://seattletransitblog.com/2017/12/15/seattles-streetcar-turns-10/)\n\nWhen the streetcar first opened, it had even worse performance than what you see now because it didn't have any dedicated transit lanes.  Not that the dedicated lanes today help too much since it still has to contend with right-turning cars, especially at Denny Way.\n\nIt eventually got semi-decent ridership during rush hour with the Amazon crowd up until Rapidride C was extended to run down Westlake.

Which really proved that a bus makes way more sense in this corridor.\n\nThe only place I've seen a \"successful\" streetcar system that also has to contend with traffic is in Toronto.

A streetcar sharing a lane with cars can get stuck in traffic the same way a bus sharing a lane with cars can get stuck in traffic.

Streetcars are also larger than buses, so they can be useful to deploy on routes where you'd otherwise need to run a bus every minute or three...again not very relevant here. \n\nGiven all that I'd err on the side of using limited transit funds to improve bus service and/or accelerate Link development.

I abhor any Chiefs fan that dons a Tyreek jersey because he hit a pregnant woman…and that organization still allows him to suit up and play in front of tens of thousands cheering fans all because he can run fast? Cool. So as long as your are productive than, you can hit whomever you want if you are a Chief. But that’s not fair to the whole fan base because I’m sure there are a ton of people (going out on a limb here for humanity sake) who don’t support Tyreek for being able to play too. \n\nAre KC fans wrong for cheering their team on or it is possible, just maybe, to like the team as a whole and simultaneously despise individuals? Are Patriot fans not allowed to cheer on their team because Kraft got a handy in a massage parlor?

I don’t want him on my team because my fandom is a personal investment of time and money into the product on the field. I don’t really care about the teams ownership group. I don’t think about them.

I’m not taking a stand, I just don’t have the motivation to be a fan of a piece of Shit of his caliber and would rather spend that energy doing something else.

Welfare programs exist, and are intended to help address poverty. They have limited funds. Every dollar wasted on fraud is a dollar not making its way towards combatting poverty. This means there's a need for better fraud detection software tailored to the needs of welfare programs.\n\nWant to help save the environment? Pick an environmental problem, and help scientists working on it write code to model the issue, or identify problems spots. Help them apply ML techniques to build decision engines and predictive models and such. There's *loads* of possible work here, it just pays like shit compared to building a CRUD app for an insurance company or whatever.\n\nI think the reason you take such a pessimistic view is that you view this only from the \"big picture\" perspective. Obviously no one software program is going to solve the whole climate change problem. But specific environmental problems certainly can make use of better software to solve them far more directly than just writing some web app to help people sign up for a mailing list. There's a vast world of difference between tackling coding problems that help people solve real problems in real life... and trying to change the world with the internet.\n\nEach of these huge problems is made up of innumerable small problems--and those small problems are often problems directly addressable by software.\n\n#### Comment ID dwbjyii with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-03-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dwbjyii/) (in reply to ID dwbf8fy):\nOn one hand, yes--I most definitely have a pessimistic view due to the big picture perspective... but how is looking at the totality of the problem not the way to solve it? What matter is it, anyway, if your software can detect fraud when the organizations running these welfare programs don't have the budget to run and maintain it, or if the fraud-doers are backed by corrupt politicians whose contrivances are vast and pockets deep such that anything recorded by the software is easily nullified by bribery? What matter is it if your software can help scientists model natural phenomena and better understand the data, when solving climate change is against the business interests of oligarchs and politicians who, together, can ensure that none of your recommendations are written and enacted into policy and that you will systematically find it difficult to get research funding?\n\nAgain, tools. Software is not going to directly address these problems at large; policy and the implementation thereof by state officials, really, are the direct solutions. Or maybe being a billionaire like Elon Musk--but even his solutions to the most challenging problems of our species which states all over the world are deliberately ignoring aren't software products by themselves.

Most jobs exist to make money for shareholders. As a result of this, often times the work that needs doing is not work someone will pay you to do.\n\nI'm surprised about the lack of discussion here about FOSS. The impact of free software is a lot more radical than working at a corporation developing proprietary solutions, as anyone in the world can use it at no cost. That right there is a good starting point.\n\nFind free software projects that feel meaningful to you, and contribute to them.

Regardless, they'll need a letter of authorization from the FAA to fly it. If the pilot is purely civilian then he will be trained by a CFI with experience (usually a vet) in the aircraft and then be tested by the FAA to get the letter of authorization. There are quite a few F-5's in civilian hands so a curriculum and testing standard no doubt exists. A LoA is like a type rating, by the way, but for aircraft under the type rating weight and experimentals that are jet powered. These aircraft are operated, most often, by firms contracted to provide \"aggressor\" aircraft in wargames, so the high cost is passed on to foreign governments (the U.S. mil doesn't use them, IIRC, because it maintains it own aggressor squadrons).\n\n#### Comment ID cj9363g with +3 score by [(drrhythm2, Reddit, 2014-07-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/2bte4w/a_privately_owned_f5_visited_sjc/cj9363g/) (in reply to ID cj8ud1f):\nIs it not true that all turbine-powered aircraft, regardless of weight, require a type rating?\n\n61.31: \n\n(a) Type ratings required.

Bill Simmons named a recent podcast after this fact.   \n\nBut if we're being honest...\n\n... and it pains me to admit this...\n\n2020, in addition to many other shitty things, marks the official dethroning of the Boston Celtics as the GOAT franchise.  \n\n* Over the past 34 years, we only have 1 NBA championship (2008).   This week will mark the Lakers 8th during that same timespan (1987, 1988, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009, 2010, 2020)\n\n* As Laker fans like to point out, only 4 of our NBA championships took place after the NBA/ABA merger in 1976. This will be the Lakers 11th.  Bulls (6 titles) and Spurs (5 titles) also lead us in post-merger championships.\n\n* The bulk of our championships (57, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66) happened when the league was 8-9 teams deep.  \n\n* Magic (5 titles) vs Bird (3 titles) was a victory for the Lakers.\n\n* Even our 1 championship in 2008 was eventually vanquished by the Lakers when they won back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010... essentially turning KG and the 08 Celtics into a Joe Frazier-esque footnote to Kobe's Muhammad Ali-esque championship legacy.\n\n* Lakers = 33 Finals appearances to Boston's 21\n\nIt sucks, but it is what it is.  The Lakers are the NBA's greatest franchise.  Must be nice to be in Los Angeles.  \n\nGotta hope that Tatum and his team can build a little dynasty here and start chipping away at the Laker league dominance.   It's been 12 years since our last championship.

Unless we draft another Pierce type of player (hoping JT is a Celtic lifer) and build a competent squad with assets and using those assets to trade for a superstar, its hard to see how teams like Boston with no geographical advantage can build a true championship squad for a 5 year window. \n\nLuckily for us Danny hit in the draft with Tatum and Brown.

Most NBA players (at least superstars) prefer a warm climate as they don't have to worry about little things like comfort with humidity or heat since they make a fuck ton of money. Cold is much more pervasive than heat. MLB players don't have to worry about it, the MLB season is spring-fall without the worst of winter. NFL players are out by the end of January and while they do have to go through winter, it isn't all of it. NHL players are a bit of a wild card- unlike NBA/NFL/MLB players, most NHL players are used to the cold being mostly Canadian, northern American, Scandinavian, or Russian. The weather isn't some horrific turn off for them like it is for a young NBA player.  \n\nNBA players are generally the ones that like to go out clubbing and partying more obviously at bare minimum than most MLB/NHL/NFL guys (how many other guys have jokes about them like Paul George and strippers, or Harden and strippers, or Kawhi and stri... you get the point, the biggest I can think of it NHL players can doing rails of coke in bar bathrooms- Bozak, Kadri, Hall are the biggies on that). Boston isn't a town built on the glitz, glamour, and nonstop partying like New York, LA, or Miami that appeals to stars with a thin veneer of gold covering a pile of failed ambitions. We are a town built on actually building shit that applies to real life in the sciences. It is a college town with the best colleges and universities in the country right up there with the best in the world. What is isn't, ZooMass excepted, is a party city- you don't have the crazy parties or clubs that New York, LA, or Miami have. If a college kid just wants to party, they go to ASU not to anywhere here. There is stuff to do absolutely, but most of it focuses on learning or history. LA has no history as a city, Miami has no history as a city, New York has some, but that isn't what you think of with New York. Boston, after colleges, medicine, and banking, has history as a big draw. That isn't an NBA thing- look at Leveon Bell who enjoys slapping ass at strip clubs and riding around jet ski's in Miami who had two places on his wishlist in FA- Miami and New York. Artemi Panarin went right to New York when he hit FA despite having a good team around him in Columbus because his girlfriend could find more work there are a model and they are known for enjoying nights out.\n\nTaxes are another reason- part of why Miami is able to get players there, look at the NHL and the discount deals that guys like Hedman, Stamkos, Kucherov, ect. took to stay in Tampa since they get far more there with no state tax than a player in Boston, Toronto, Montreal, ect.\n\nNBA players also hit FA a bit earlier than any other sport as most come in and play right away at 18/19 and can be a UFA by 25 with a 3 year rookie deal and 4 on a second contract, most MLB free agents don't hit the market until they are 29 or older, the best players are at minimum 26-27. The NHL is about the same, 26 being only for the guys like Tavares, most hit it in the 27-29 range. Look at David Pastrnak, 3 year rookie deal, then signed a 6 year deal as a RFA, no NBA player is gonna sign a 6 year deal- it is 4 with a player option for a 5th year likely that they will decline to make bank at 25. The NFL is a bit different- players can be UFA's by 26 in spite of playing football, but the big names the Pats have signed have been people ring chasing or using BB as a method to get a big contract somewhere else.\n\nThat doesn't sound like much, but the biggest thing I have noticed is players who have a family love Boston. Jarome Iginla played here one year and then moved here full time after retiring because he felt it gave his kids a great education and that was important to him. Guys like Theis, Hayward, IT,  Horford, ect.- the ones with family love Boston as a city. It has a ton of great qualities for a successful family. It doesn't have much to appeal to a young NBA player who likely wants to party, fuck, and enjoy the hell out of their personal life. We see a lot of older people from MA move to places like Florida or Arizona if they can afford it after their families have moved on into their own lives because once they aren't a family, the perks of Boston aren't as important anymore compared to a warmer, easier climate for their bodies. That goes full circle to NBA players without any attachments. \n\nTL;DR: New York, LA, and Miami are the business majors who are built, constantly partying, and having a good time- Boston is the nerdy, in decent shape but not built pre-med major who is focused on academia more than the college experience, NBA players are sorority girls on Tinder who don't give a shit about anything beyond the next 24 hours when they are swiping.\n\n#### Comment ID g83w370 with +7 score by [(pittiv20, Reddit, 2020-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g83w370/) (in reply to ID g83m0o4):\nThe actual answer is because there is legitimately nothing for a rich black man to do in Boston.

You know, if we are counting random Midwest franchises histories as our own.\n\n## Comment ID g83q4uq with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g83q4uq/) (in reply to ID j6y7pj):\nLakers always played on easy mode. See how many top tier free agents went there and how many players indicated they wanted to be traded there. Shaq, Howard, Nash, Gasol, AD (who didn't want to go to Celtics mind you!), Lebron. How many decent 2nd tier, like Artest? Meanwhile Boston just had the KG + Ray Allen and recently Kemba, Kyrie was traded here and him being a cancer he left, so I don't even count that as a good trade. The rest they had to draft. Even Clippers are more attractive to players, cause it's in LA.\n\nKnicks might be worth more, but LA is THE team in NBA, they have it easy like Real Madrid in Spain - they are funded by the crown of Spain. Other teams like Boston, Miami, OKC and Bucks are more impressive cause they had to build it on their own. And Laker fans still think they were fucked on the CP3 non-trade. Puh-lease, if the league hadn't stepped in it might as well be LALBA (Los Angeles Lakers Basketball League). They famously get favorable calls, bitch and moan to the refs with close to no consequences, it's ridiculous.\n\nEDIT: forgot Hayward, his bad luck made me forget him as a star sign.\n\n## Comment ID g82ejeh with +2 score by [(horseshoeoverlook, Reddit, 2020-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g82ejeh/) (in reply to ID j6y7pj):\nImagine the Lakers doesn't make the playoffs for six years and they win a championship first than us. \n\n\nThe only edge we have against them is regular season wins, total and head-to-head lol. We have no more bragging rights.\n\n### Comment ID g82fe4c with +2 score by [(LarBrd33, Reddit, 2020-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g82fe4c/) (in reply to ID g82ejeh):\nThey outright tanked harder than the 76ers and it was a key reason they had the assets to trade for Davis.   I mean, the spent a year tanking under the guise of a Kobe Bryant farewell tour where Kobe jacked up 17 shots per night while shooting 35% from the field and 28% from three... that would be like giving Marcus Smart 17 shots per night, but he'd actually be slightly more efficient.  Blatant outright shameful tanking.\n\nBoston only really tried tanking for a season.  They just took Brooklyn to pound town and ended up with all their top picks for a few years.\n\n#### Comment ID g82fh9o with +1 score by [(horseshoeoverlook, Reddit, 2020-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g82fh9o/) (in reply to ID g82fe4c):\nAnd they actually traded their top picks for a top 5 guy\n\n### Comment ID g83vr70 with +1 score by [(Dondon1927, Reddit, 2020-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g83vr70/) (in reply to ID g82ejeh):\nThat's what happens when you're the Lakers. Can't even be mad at it, we all knew it was a matter of time before they got good again\n\n## Comment ID g81ej5z with +3 score by [(idzova, Reddit, 2020-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g81ej5z/) (in reply to ID j6y7pj):\nDon't worry, we still love and respect the Celtics. \n\nLakers + Celtics > Rest of the NBA\n\n## Comment ID g81c9rj with +1 score by [(jotyma5, Reddit, 2020-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g81c9rj/) (in reply to ID j6y7pj):\nYou mean only 4 took place *after* the merger\n\n### Comment ID g81cjv7 with +1 score by [(LarBrd33, Reddit, 2020-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g81cjv7/) (in reply to ID g81c9rj):\nEdited it.

It's a culture of fear that will not change because it comes directly from Paul Allen. \"Owner meetings\" as they are called are unpredictable and can go well or poorly depending on Paul's mood. Senior management operates on his whim and therefore the company lacks strategy and clear level-headed directional planning. Senior management will do anything to keep their well-paying jobs: they repeatedly move/alter project goals/direction and blame their employees when projects don't go as planned. Self-preservation at Vulcan is senior management's primary goal.  A series of poor hires at the C-suite level have sent the company reeling. The technology department, in particular, is in upheaval and the new leader has a complete disregard for his team. Company morale has taken another massive beating.",

Provide a path of upward mobility to employees instead of telling young people that there's no where to go within the company for them. Build a culture that cares about problem solving and creativity instead of filling out paperwork.

Vertical communication, up and down, is not healthy: there is some \"yes\"-men/women mentality, and I think honesty in interactions suffer for that. Despite being an organization owned by a billionaire, there is an unreasonable financial austerity when it comes to HR that can sometimes stifle growth of employees and success of projects. In my opinion, the performance appraisal process here is very counterproductive. Employees are graded on a curve (remember college courses?) HR rejects the notion of \"stack ranking\", but under the hood, managers have to stack rank to determine how their teams members are distributed under the curve. The curve is determined by how well the company and department has been rated that year. The PA and goal-setting processes together extend over several months.",

In my opinion, the performance appraisal process here is very counterproductive. Employees are graded on a curve (remember college courses?) HR rejects the notion of \"stack ranking\", but under the hood, managers have to stack rank to determine how their teams members are distributed under the curve.

      "# [Jody Allen by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2013-04-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jody_Allen)\nAmerican businesswoman, entrepreneur, and philanthropist\n\nFor the senior editor at the Pew Research Center, see Jodie Allen.\n\nJo Lynn \"Jody\" Allen (born February 3, 1959) is an American businesswoman, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. She is the sister of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, and served as the chief executive officer of his investment and project management company, Vulcan Inc., from its founding in 1986 until 2015.[1][2] She is also the co-founder and president of the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation.[3]\n\nFollowing the death of her brother in October 2018, Allen was named executor and trustee of his estate, pursuant to his instructions, giving her responsibility for overseeing the execution of his will and settling his affairs with tax authorities and parties with an interest in his projects.[4] Among some of the properties she took control of upon his death were the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL), the Octopus super-yacht, and the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), along with minority ownership of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS).[5][6]\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nAllen was born in Seattle, Washington on February 3, 1959, the daughter of schoolteacher Edna Faye (née Gardner) Allen[7] and Kenneth Sam Allen, an associate director of the University of Washington Libraries.[7][8] Her older brother Paul went on to become co-founder of Microsoft Corporation.[9] She grew up in Seattle's Wedgwood neighborhood and graduated from Lakeside School in 1975.[9][10] She studied drama at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, and was a member of the class of 1980.[10][11][12]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1986, Allen co-founded Vulcan Inc. with her brother to manage their family's business and charitable endeavors.[2] Vulcan's former chief financial officer described her as being \"responsible for having the trains run on time\" and said she had \"a particular passion for real estate development, building things in general.\"[13]\n\nShe currently serves as vice-chair of First & Goal Inc., which oversees operations of the Seattle Seahawks.[2] She was involved in negotiating the public-private partnership that led to the construction of Lumen Field in Seattle, and was an adviser to her brother when he first considered buying the Seahawks.[14][15] In 1997, a Seattle reporter wrote: \"Jody Patton thought buying the Seahawks was a great idea; thus was born Allen's efforts to acquire the team and build a new football stadium.\"[15]\n\nDuring her career Allen also supervised construction of the Moda Center in Portland, Oregon, renovation of the Seattle Cinerama, and also helped bring the EMP Museum (now the Museum of Pop Culture or MoPOP) to Seattle.[11] She is also president of Vulcan Productions, a company that produces films, digital programs, and outreach initiatives, and has produced or executive-produced more than a dozen documentaries and feature films.[16][17] In 2013, she signed on as a backer of two documentaries, the Richard E. Robbins-directed film Girl Rising and the nuclear power documentary Pandora's Promise.[18][19]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2013, five of her former security guards accused her of sexual harassment, and extensive unethical activity, including bribing customs officials to smuggle animal bones out of Africa and Antarctica.[20] The lawsuits were eventually settled out of court.[21]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\n[edit]\n\nAllen co-founded the Paul G.

      "# [Are the Trail Blazers Any Closer to Being Sold? by Dave Deckard, www.facebook.com on 2024-07-31](https://www.blazersedge.com/2024/7/31/24209769/portland-trail-blazers-sale-rumors-jody-allen-nba-tv-rights-deal-broadcast-amount-vulcan-inc-paul)\nThe Portland Trail Blazers have changed coaches, general managers, and floor personnel over the last four years, but their ownership has remained the same throughout. As of July, 2024, Jody Allen and Vulcan Sports still hold controlling interest in the franchise, to the chagrin of many Blazers fans who expect—and perhaps want—the team to be sold. Are we any closer to that event this summer than we were last? That’s the subject of today’s Blazer’s Edge Mailbag.\n\nHello Dave,\n\nWith the new NBA television deal having been finalized, will that make it any more likely that Jody will sell the team to a new owner sooner rather than later? Perhaps she plans to hang on to the team indefinitely? What are your thoughts?\n\nPatrick B\n\nMeddling in the minds of NBA owners is perilous business, but I would guess that finalizing the new broadcast rights deal was a necessary step to setting the price of the team, should it be sold.\n\nLots of people guessed at potential numbers for the new contract. I’m not sure $76 billion over 11 years crossed anyone’s lips until it happened. Surely incumbent owners had a clue, but they couldn’t very well broadcast (ha!) the amount. Nor would it have shown up on organizational ledgers. Until the deal got done, it was vapor and rumor.\n\nNow both seller and buyer have a tangible forecast for this critical revenue stream over the next decade. That’s one of the two major undecided pieces, along with any expansion fees franchises might rake in. And the broadcast deal is by far the bigger.\n\nWith the numbers in place, sellers can now account for the increased value of the franchise during the span of the deal, while buyers can factor in the income from broadcast partners. This makes setting—and paying—a price much easier.\n\nSo I’d guess that if the Trail Blazers are going to be sold anytime soon, we’re one step closer to the transaction...one of the most important steps, at that.\n\nThat said, be careful what you wish for. Who buys the franchise next is going to be just as important as the final price or timing of the sale. Ownership is increasingly becoming the province of billionaires, a trend that late owner Paul Allen helped pioneer. Once upon a time, teams were purchased by fanatical, motivated individuals such as Allen and Mark Cuban. This had advantages and drawbacks, but either way, the owner’s connection to the franchise and its success was personal.\n\nAs the cost of entry soars into the billions, though, corporations are going to start to take over where individuals once ruled. The obsession will shift away from prestige and winning towards efficiency and the bottom line. That could spell disaster for a small-market franchise like Portland.\n\nWhenever the Blazers are moved, let’s hope they fall into the hands of someone who cares rather than the Executive Vice President of Sports and Marketing in some investment firm, simply looking to run the project for financial leverage. Call me stupid, but I’ll take a billionaire cowboy over an umbrella organization every time.",
      "# [Paul Allen's Historic Computers Under the Hammer by Sue Gee](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/82-heritage/17430-paul-allens-enigma-machine-under-the-hammer.html)\nDozens of rare historic computers are currently up for auction. As well as a room-sized PDP 7, there's an Altair, an Apple I, a Cray I and an Enigma machine on offer to the highest bidder as the private collection of the late Paul Allen, is sold by Christies, New York.\n\nAs well as being co-founder of Microsoft with Bill Gates, the duo responsible for bringing BASIC to the home computer, specifically the Altair 8800, Paul Allen was an avid collector. During his lifetime he had amassed not only historic computers and notable technology, but also artworks and precious artefacts of all kinds.\n\nAllen was also a philanthropist who supported the arts, music, sport, science and technology. After resigning from Microsoft in 1983, he set up Vulcan Inc. in 1986 as an investment and project management firm with his sister, Jody Allen and two years later established the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation to oversee his philanthropic venture. Now, nearly six years after his death in October 2018, from complications of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a disease he was first diagnosed with in 1982, items from his private collection are being sold to further his philanthropic mission.\n\nIn fact the number of items is so large, so varied and so valuable that Christies has split them across three sales. The collective title for the sales is \"Gen One: Innovations from the Paul G. Allen Collection\" and expectations are high given that in 2022 a previous auction titled \"Visionary: The Paul G. Allen Collection\" and comprising 155 art masterpieces achieved $1.62 billion, becoming the most valuable private collection ever to come to auction. The artworks now going on sale are in one of the two online auctions that started on August 23rd and finishes on September 12th. As it's title, \"Over the Horizon: Art of the Future from the Paul G. Allen Collection\" suggest, works in the 57 lots are devoted to how the future, especially interplanetary travel, was imagined by artists and other thinkers during the 20th century including Chesley Bonestell, Robert McCall, R.C. Swanson, George Gibbs, and Fred Freeman. According to Christies:\n\nThe artworks in this auction, along with their publication in popular magazines, inspired a generation of explorers, scientists, and aerospace engineers.\n\nThe concurrent online auction is Firsts: The History of Computing from the Paul G. Allen Collection which Christies claim:\n\npresents important milestones in the history of computing, some of which have been preserved in working order\n\nThe 58 lots in this sale comprises the bulk of the contents of the Living Computers, the Seattle-based museum, which Paul Allen founded in 2012 to display his growing collection of historic computers and have them restored to working order and maintained by a team of engineers. In this video posted by Christies, Stephen Jones, Senior Restoration & Collection Manager, Living Computers sets the scene and introduces some of the historic computers that he used to be responsible for, presenting a timeline that highlights the breakthroughs in technology that the machines represent.\n\nAs reported in Paul Allen's Living Computer Museum Going, Going, Gone Living Computers had been forced to close to the public by the pandemic 2020. It never re-opened much to the disappointment of those who appreciated Paul Allen's aim of preserving vintage and heritage computers for posterity. One aficionado, Seattle-area tech veteran, Paolo Tosolini, founder of Tosolini Productions, had done a high-tech 3D photo scans of Living Computers and later created a more detailed scan of the first and second floors. Now, using technology from the 3D-capture platform Matterport, interactive “hot spots” have been added to 16 items that are up for auction, including the PDP 7 and the Apple 1 with links to lot details at Chrisitie's.\n\nClick on image to go to the Virtual Tour of LCM and see how Paul Allen's collection told the history of computing.\n\nWhile the online auction a mix of huge and small items, from the PDP 7 to mercury delay line memory from the Remington Rand Univac, the gems of the LMC collection are included in the \"live auction, \"Pushing Boundaries: Ingenuity from the Paul G. Allen Collection, taking place at Christies Rockefeller Center galleries in New York on September with viewing open from September 6-9. It comprises 36 lots, including Einstein’s letter to President Roosevelt which propelled the US into the nuclear age and crucial artifacts from the Space Race, including astronaut Ed White’s spacesuit cover layer, the pilot’s in-flight logbook from Apollo 8, and an annotated checklist from the first American spacewalk in June 1965.\n\nThe historic computers included in the sale all have important stories. The MITS Altair 8800 is as Christie's state:\n\nThe first commercially successful personal computer, which catalysed the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s.\n\nMore importantly for Paul Allen it was the machine for which he and Bill Gates, when they were 22 and 20 years old respectively, created a BASIC interpreter, to know more about this and how it led to the formation of Microsoft, see articles in our History section.\n\nWhile Apple Is are rare, the one included in the sale, with an estimate of $500,000-800,00 is unique. Around 200 units were originally produced and one of these was retained by the company probably to be used a as demo unit. As explained in the lot details this machine was removed from its place in Jobs’ office in 1985 by Don Hutmacher after Steve Jobs was dismissed from Apple and engineers were allowed to take items from his office. Hutchmacher's Apple security pass is included in the lot.\n\nBy way of Apple I memorabilia, the auction also includes a lot comprising two typed letters, the first of which dated 5 November 1976, is signed twice by Steve Jobs and has apologetic annotation in his handwriting. Its estimate is $50,000–80,000.\n\nThere's also an Enigma Machine. We've covered the auction of several of these over the years, seeing them realize from $100,000 upwards. This one is a four-rotor model, manufactured by Heimsoeth & Rinke in 1941 and has an estimate of $250,000-350,000.\n\nAnother lot that caught my eye is an IBM 360/91 console, which according to Chrisitie's:\n\nstands as a testament to the advanced technology of its era, representing the height of the System/360 line and offering a rare glimpse into the computing innovations of the 1960s.\n\nHaving been owned by Princeton University and exhibited by Walt Disney Picture in Tomorrowland in 2015, this example was restored at Living Computers. Having had new circuitry added, the console:\n\nnow includes an animated display demonstrating its operation, complete with a playful light show currently programmed where Pac-Man chases a ghost, adding a touch of modern whimsy to its historical significance.\n\nMoving forward a decade there is a Cray-1 Supercomputer. Only around 80 units were ever built and this one, Serial Number 12 was purchased in 1981 by the University of Minnesota and was designed to match UMN colors. After being decommissioned it was used as a sales model for Cray Research Inc. Only 17 Cray-1s are thought to survive and this is the first to come to auction with an estimate of USD 150,000 – USD 250,000.\n\nThere's a decommissioned Cray-2 in the online auction with an estimate of USD 150,000 – USD 250,000, but as yet no bid has yet been placed. One does have to wonder who has deep enough pockets and sufficient spare room to afford to win such an item. Although the computers are indeed important milestones in the history of computing they can also be seen as white elephants - expensive to maintain and a big responsibility due to their rarity.\n\nAs Stephen Jones points out in the video Living Computers was:\n\n\"a grand collection of restored machines, some of the most important milestones in the history of computing\"\n\nwhich Paul Allen had put together to inspire the next generation of technologists. Even though all the proceeds of the sales are destined for charitable causes, the idea that this collection is being dispersed, with much of it disappearing from public view, comes as a great disappointment to people, including those who had donated their computers to preserve them for posterity and to make them accessible to future generations.\n\nMore Information\n\nGen One: Innovations from the Paul G.

      "# [Seattle U Law students earn prestigious Gregoire Fellowships](https://law.seattleu.edu/about/newscenter/all-current-stories/seattle-u-law-students-earn-prestigious-gregoire-fellowships.html)\nFour outstanding first-year Seattle University School of Law JD students have been named Gregoire Fellows in recognition of their academic and professional achievements, unique perspectives and experiences, and leadership potential to diversify the Washington legal profession. The program is named in honor of former Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire, who practiced law before becoming governor.\n\nAfter completing their first year of law school, fellows spend the summer clerking at both a major law firm and either a Seattle-based corporation or government agency. In addition to summer employment, Gregoire Fellows receive:\n\nThree-year Seattle U Law scholarship\n\n$20,000 first-year summer stipend\n\nMentorship from Gov. Gregoire and members of the Seattle legal community\n\n$5,000 bar exam study stipend\n\n“We are very proud to have these four scholars as Seattle U Law students. They exemplify the law school’s values of academic excellence, diversity, leadership, and passion for social justice,” said Dean Anthony E. Varona. “The Gregoire Fellows Program is a wonderful opportunity for these students to gain valuable experience in the legal profession and learn from some of our region’s most esteemed leaders.”\n\nEmmi Bella ’26 immigrated to the U.S. from the Philippines as a toddler. At the University of California, Davis, she double-majored in philosophy and communications, graduating in just two years, all while juggling two part-time jobs. Bella said that it is her parents’ sacrifice to bring her to a new country that pushes her to work so hard.\n\n“That’s why I would wish to advocate for others,” she said. “I was given these opportunities by my parents, and there are so many other people from similar situations who don’t have the same opportunities I do; it’s my duty to use my privilege to speak on behalf of others.”\n\nShe hopes to use her law degree to advocate for workers, especially those experiencing sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\n“If you work, you should be able to benefit from it,” Bella said. “You need to be able to stand up for yourself in a place in which you have the right to work.”\n\nDuring Tyler King’s ’26 sophomore year of college at Florida State University, Hurricane Michael devastated his hometown of Panama City, Florida. To help his family financially recover, King worked full-time while taking a full load of classes. Suffering heavy losses to a climate-related disaster inspired King to pursue environmental law, as well as to advocate for affordable housing.\n\nKing was especially inspired to be a voice for the underprivileged when he saw how the law field can be lacking in diversity; King, who is gay and a first-generation law student from a family that struggled financially, has sometimes felt out of place.\n\n“It’s important to make people who aren’t part of that majority feel like their voices are important. We’re just as capable, smart, and hardworking,” he said. “We need to show diverse people being successful, so the younger generation sees that. It’s clear that Seattle U Law highly values diversity; I knew that I was going to be seen as an important part of the community coming here.”\n\nGrowing up in a working-class, half-Filipino, half-Chinese family in San Francisco, Emily Masangcay ’26 said it never occurred to her to become a lawyer because she simply was not exposed to attorneys. But this changed when Masangcay, who studied business administration and economics at the University of Puget Sound, “fell in love with working in contracts” at Amazon Web Services.\n\n“We see the legal profession as one where minorities aren’t represented. I’ve always felt very underrepresented. It’s hard to dream of yourself in a certain role if you don’t see anyone in the top there,” she said. “It motivates me to be a trailblazer in certain communities. My parents were mail carriers growing up, so even the concept of doing an advanced degree is very different from the community I grew up in.”\n\nShe feels pride and gratefulness to be a Gregoire Fellow.\n\n“Christine Gregoire is a female leader in the legal field that was long overdue,” Masangcay said. “To sit in class and see how many females there are with me is empowering.”\n\nAfter graduating from Bowdoin College in Maine and moving back home to Seattle, Liem Tu ’26 began his career in educational consulting. However, he soon determined that his heart lay in the legal field.\n\n“I realized I needed some aspect of social justice in my career or in my volunteer life,” said Tu, a first-generation American who regularly picks up trash in the International District with Friends of Little Saigon. “Part of what drew me to Seattle University and to the legal field in general was how you can mix business with service work. You’re helping people and you have that one-on-one relationship with your clients.”\n\nPart of Tu’s desire to become an immigration lawyer comes from his dad’s sacrifice; he gave up his own legal career to move from Vietnam to the U.S.\n\n“His eyes light up when I talk about law school because it was his dream to do that and he never was able to,” Tu said. “It gives me a little extra motivation.”\n\nThe Gregoire Fellows Program is made possible thanks to generous support from sponsors, including Amazon, Davis Wright Tremaine, Expedia Group, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, K&L Gates LLP, Keller Rohrback LLP, King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office, Lane Powell PC, Moss Adams LLP, Microsoft Corp., Nintendo of America Inc., Ogden Murphy Wallace PLLC, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Pacifica Law Group, Perkins Coie LLP, Reed Longyear PLLC, Ryan Swanson PLLC, Seagen Inc., Starbucks Corp., Stoel Rives LLP, Stokes Lawrence PS, Vulcan Inc., Washington State Office of the Attorney General, and Weyerhaeuser Co.",

The data generated from this project is publicly accessible and is being used to inform conservation strategies worldwide.\n\n## Company Scale and Financials\n\nWhile specific revenue figures for Vulcan Inc. are not publicly disclosed, the company is recognized as a multi-billion dollar family office managing a diverse portfolio of investments across various sectors, including technology, real estate, and sports. The scale of its operations is underscored by its ownership of major sports franchises and significant real estate developments [(Jody Allen by Contributors to Wikimedia projects, 2013)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jody_Allen).\n\n## Public Perception and Controversies\n\nVulcan Inc. has faced some controversies, particularly surrounding Jody Allen's leadership. In 2013, allegations of sexual harassment and unethical behavior were made against her, which were settled out of court [(Jody Allen by Contributors to Wikimedia projects, 2013)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jody_Allen). Despite these issues, the company continues to maintain a strong public presence through its philanthropic efforts and community engagement.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVulcan Inc. stands as a significant player in both the investment and philanthropic landscapes, driven by the legacy of Paul Allen and the ongoing leadership of Jody Allen. With a focus on diversifying investments and enhancing its philanthropic impact, the company is well-positioned for future growth. Prospective candidates and investors should consider Vulcan Inc.'s strategic initiatives and its commitment to social responsibility as key factors in their decision-making processes."
