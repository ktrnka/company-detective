  "summary_markdown": "# About Vulcan Inc.\n\nVulcan Inc. is an investment and project management firm founded in 1986 by Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft. The company operates across a diverse range of sectors, including technology, real estate, and philanthropy. Following Paul Allen's death in October 2018, the company continues under the leadership of his sister, Jody Allen, maintaining a strong commitment to Allen's philanthropic vision, which includes significant contributions to science, technology, and the arts [(Sue Gee, I Programmer, 2023)](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/82-heritage/17430-paul-allens-enigma-machine-under-the-hammer.html).\n\nVulcan Inc. functions as a multi-billion dollar family office, with a substantial portion of its portfolio dedicated to various investments. As of 2024, Vulcan Capital, the investment arm of Vulcan Inc., has approximately 5% of its portfolio invested in Asia, indicating a strategic focus on expanding its global investment footprint [(Private Equity International, 2024)](https://www.privateequityinternational.com/institution-profiles/cercano-management.html).\n\nThe company is not product-centric in the traditional sense but is involved in various technology-related initiatives, such as the Living Computers: Museum + Labs, which showcases historic computers to inspire future generations of technologists [(Sue Gee, I Programmer, 2023)](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/82-heritage/17430-paul-allens-enigma-machine-under-the-hammer.html).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Jody Allen**: She leads Vulcan Inc. following the death of her brother, Paul Allen. Her leadership continues to emphasize the company's philanthropic and investment goals.\n- **Jennifer Crawford**: Vice President of Human Resources at Vulcan Inc. She has played a key role in launching the FAME program, highlighting the company's commitment to workforce development [(WHISPER EDWARDSEditorial Assistant, Gulf Coast Media, 2024)](https://gulfcoastmedia.com/stories/baldwin-county-launches-fame-chapter-to-boost-local-manufacturing-workforce,233672).\n\n# News\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Fundraising and Philanthropy\nVulcan Inc. has been actively involved in philanthropic initiatives, such as the Allen Coral Atlas project, which aims to map and conserve coral reefs globally. This project uses advanced satellite technology to provide detailed information about coral reef distribution and composition, aiding scientists and policymakers in conservation efforts [(University of Queensland, 2023)](https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2024/01/satellites-unveil-size-and-nature-of-world%E2%80%99s-coral-reefs).\n\n### Partnerships and Collaborations\nIn September 2024, Vulcan Inc. announced a partnership with Coastal Alabama Community College to launch a new chapter of the Federation for Advanced Manufacturing Education (FAME). This initiative is designed to create a skilled workforce in the manufacturing sector through a hybrid work-study program, allowing students to gain practical experience while earning an Advanced Manufacturing Technician credential [(WHISPER EDWARDSEditorial Assistant, Gulf Coast Media, 2024)](https://gulfcoastmedia.com/stories/baldwin-county-launches-fame-chapter-to-boost-local-manufacturing-workforce,233672).\n\n## Opinions and Sentiment\nVulcan Inc. generally enjoys a positive reputation, particularly for its philanthropic efforts. However, it has faced scrutiny, such as when Paul Allen's yacht was implicated in damaging coral reefs in the Cayman Islands. Vulcan Inc. took responsibility and committed to funding restoration efforts, demonstrating a proactive approach to environmental stewardship [(Mara Siegler, Page Six, 2024)](https://www.ieyenews.com/tag/vulcan-inc/).\n\n# Additional Reading\n\n- [Vulcan Real Estate](https://vulcanrealestate.com/) (2023-04-06)\n- [About Vulcan Real Estate](https://vulcanrealestate.com/About/) (2023-04-10)\n- [News + Press](https://vulcanrealestate.com/news-press/) (2023-04-18)\n- [Careers](https://vulcanrealestate.com/about/careers/) (2023-04-11)\n- [Terms of Use](https://vulcanrealestate.com/terms-of-use/) (2023-05-10)\n- [Privacy Policy](https://vulcanrealestate.com/privacy-policy/) (2023-04-26)\n- [Vulcan Tech Dev Blog](https://techblog.vulcan.com/post/154821633396/from-logbooks-to-web-consoles-the-tech-behind-das) (2016-12-22)\n- [Comprehensive Analyst Report on Vulcan Inc.](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/82-heritage/17430-paul-allens-enigma-machine-under-the-hammer.html) (2023)\n- [University of Queensland on Allen Coral Atlas](https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2024/01/satellites-unveil-size-and-nature-of-world%E2%80%99s-coral-reefs) (2023)\n- [Gulf Coast Media on FAME Program](https://gulfcoastmedia.com/stories/baldwin-county-launches-fame-chapter-to-boost-local-manufacturing-workforce,233672) (2024)\n- [Private Equity International on Vulcan Capital](https://www.privateequityinternational.com/institution-profiles/cercano-management.html) (2024)\n- [Page Six on Environmental Stewardship](https://www.ieyenews.com/tag/vulcan-inc/) (2024)\n\nVulcan Inc. remains a significant player in both the investment landscape and social impact initiatives, with a strong focus on innovation, sustainability, and community development.",

For example, Google Web Tools interact with other Google Inc. products and services in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy. Please see the section below on “Managing Your Information” for ways to manage how your information is shared via Google Web Tools.\n\nHow Your Information is Used\n\nPlease see below on the circumstances where VRE may share your personal information with others without further notice, obligation or liability to you:\n\nService Providers: VRE may use third-party providers to provide or support some of the services that are available through the Site, including without limitation, communications and hosting services, network security, technical and user support, tracking and reporting, quality assurance testing, and other functions. VRE may share your information with these third-party providers so that they can perform their services or complete your requests.

Please note that if you change your settings to opt out of receiving cookies, it will not retroactively delete or remove any previously collected information, but it will prevent your information from being shared through such cookies from that point on.\n\nWithin the US: If the Site detects that your IP address is from a location within the United States, you will be prompted to accept or reject cookies when you first visit the platform. If you accept, you accept all of the cookies specified in the “Cookies” section above. If you take no action, you will be deemed as having accepted the cookies. If you opt out, you will be directed to a settings page where you can select which cookies to opt out of receiving. You cannot, however, opt out of Strictly Necessary Cookies, but you can configure your browser settings to block or alert you about them. If you block Strictly Necessary Cookies, some parts of the Site will have degraded performance or will not work. You can turn off cookies in your browser settings at any time, and delete previously saved cookies and other browsing data by clearing your browsing data and history.\n\nOutside of the US: If the Site detects that your IP address is from a location outside of the United States, all of the same apply as above, except if you take no action to accept or reject cookies, you will be deemed as having rejected the cookies.\n\nGoogle Web Tools\n\nYou can manage how your information is shared and used with Google Web Tools as follows:\n\nGoogle Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on: Google has developed a browser add-on tool to enable visitors of websites with Google cookies and tags to prevent Google Analytics from receiving their information. This add-on will not prevent websites from collecting information through other first party or third-party cookies and tags. You can download and install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to begin using this tool.\n\nGoogle Settings: In addition to above, you can manage how Google uses the information obtained through Google Web Tools and other cookies, and how it interacts with other Google products by changing the settings in your Google account. For example, you can restrict personalization features used in Google ads by changing your preference settings in your Google account to prevent use for targeted ads and content. Please review Google’s Privacy Controls for more general information on how you can configure various privacy and share settings through Google.\n\nThird-Party Tools: Third parties have also developed mechanisms for opting out of various cookies that use and share information collected from Google Web Tools and other sources for advertising purposes. For US-based users, the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) WebChoices is a tool that enables you to view and manage the cookies used for online advertising. For EU-based users, there is Your Online Choices.\n\nCompliance\n\nInformation collected from the Site will be stored and processed in the United States.

      "# [Vulcan Tech Dev Blog — From Logbooks to Web Consoles: The Tech Behind DAS by vulcantech on 2016-12-22](https://techblog.vulcan.com/post/154821633396/from-logbooks-to-web-consoles-the-tech-behind-das)\nOn the Philanthropic Technology team at Vulcan, we collaborate with other organizations to identify and solve some of the big problems facing our world. One major initiative we’ve focused on recently is the Domain Awareness Project, also known as DAS, where we are collaborating with conservationists in Africa to protect elephants. DAS complements another of our key initiatives to safeguard this species, described in a previous tech blog: Technology for the Great Elephant Census.\n\nAll of the conservation area teams we talked to are using logbooks to record incidents and animal movements. These logbooks are used both as a reference and to compile monthly reports. Those monthly reports are then compiled into annual reports developed to inform the boards of these conservation areas about what occurred over the year. Typically, all of this information was then placed on a physical shelf to collect dust.\n\nCommunications from rangers in the field went into similar logbooks. Some organizations augmented these paper systems with rudimentary database systems written in MS Access or built in complex spreadsheets. We all agreed there was a nee to consolidate and make this information more easily accessible to their entire organizations in near real-time.\n\nSave the Elephants, or STE, is a research and conservation organization based in Kenya. STE pioneered the use of elephant collars to record and analyze elephant movements. We have been collaborating with STE on other projects and were familiar with their tracking platform. Through discussions with them and others, their tracking platform became the genesis for DAS. Working with STE, we have incorporated their animal-tracking expertise with new functionality to record the data streams typically found in conservation areas. This project culminated in the DAS platform, which provides conservation area managers with a tool to visualize and monitor their animals, rangers, and related incidents.\n\nIn our first minimal viable product, or MVP, of DAS, we first collected animal-collar tracking information and displayed it on a website. Next, we added security so users were limited to which animals they could access and how much of the tracking they could view. We have also worked with several handheld radio platform makers that rangers carry in the field. With the integration of ranger radios, it allows the conservation area managers to contact them and coordinate ranger movements.\n\nOn the same map we use to visualize animal and ranger movements, we also show reports of incidents. The radio operator receives calls about incidents and enters these reports directly in DAS. These are communications of status or occurrences sent in from the field. In the military, the base report is known as a situational report or sitrep. Our technology allows the radio operator to enter these sitreps directly into DAS which in most cases includes a location for visualization on the map.\n\nAbove is an example image of the DAS web console. (Note: This is an example conservation area, not a real place.) On the left is the big map showing the location of the elephants and their tracks. On the right is the list of incoming reports. Not shown is the map layers tab that allows the user to see or hide different user interface elements, such as the reports, animals, rangers, or geographic points of interest.\n\nIn addition to the sitreps, there was other data we needed to incorporate, such as human wildlife conflict, or HWC, reports. A HWC report records a ranger in contact with a person of concern. Additionally, a vehicle report describes a vehicle of interest, such as car or truck that is not supposed to be in the conservation area.\n\nBased on these different report types, we investigated several ideas, including having many tables in the database or one wide table with many empty fields. We looked at entity-attribute-value – EAV – pairs. Using EAV works in some cases, but the downside for us was the extra work to query the data. We needed to address custom report data storage while also considering how the user interface (UI) would render it. We discovered an open standard called JSON Schema that looked interesting, and there was a validation implementation available in Python. We also found an Angular Forms implementation for rendering the user interface. We chose PostgreSQL, which includes JSON support at the field level. Using JSON Schema to define the custom report data, then rendering it using existing libraries allowed us to quickly support custom reports for our initial sites.\n\nDAS is built on the Django Web Framework and is written in Python. We use PostgreSQL and PostGIS for storing and accessing data. Various open source-based GIS libraries, including GDAL, PyProj, Shapely and Fiona, are used to analyze movement data. Django Rest Framework provides our restful API. Additionally, we have used a SocketIO library to support real-time updates to our single web page app. Our visualization consists of a single page Angular web app, specifically using MapBox and Leaflet technology for the map render piece. Redis rounds out our infrastructure to provide queuing and real-time communication coordination.\n\nDuring development, we used AWS RDS and ElasticCache to host our PostgreSQL and Redis services respectively. ElasticBeanstalk provides an easy to configure almost all-in-one pipeline. For production, we need to have the ability to deploy on-premise as well as in the cloud and have moved to using Chef to coordinate this type of deployment.\n\nWe have DAS installed at two conservation areas so far with plans for another to go live in January 2017."

      "# Post ID 1apmpn4: sad that living computers: museum + labs is still closed but feeling a bit of hope! with +88 score by [(skyscapeparadise, Reddit, 2024-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1apmpn4/sad_that_living_computers_museum_labs_is_still/)\nWhen the Living Computers museum closed during the pandemic, several other Vale Group (formerly Vulcan Inc.) museums/public spaces closed as well including the Cinerama and the Flying Heritage Collection. It seemed as though none of these spaces would ever be open to the public again as the priorities of Vale Group appeared to be shifting away from these projects. However, given that both the Cinerama and the Flying Heritage Collection have been sold off to new owners who have reopened them, I'm hoping that Living Computers can meet this positive fate as well. I never had the opportunity to visit LCM+L since I had only recently moved to Washington at the time. Most people don't care about old computers but being someone who is really interested in history and technology, the thought of being able to try out a Xerox Alto or a PDP-11 or an Apple I seems incredible! It makes me sad that this one-of-a-kind resource has been in limbo, but my hope is that Vale is in the process of selling the museum to an owner who will give it the care and attention it deserves. I haven't given up the dream of being able to visit this museum!\n\n## Comment ID kq7dj58 with +22 score by [(aerothorn, Reddit, 2024-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1apmpn4/sad_that_living_computers_museum_labs_is_still/kq7dj58/) (in reply to ID 1apmpn4):\nIt's a fantastic museum, I am not holding my breath on it reopening but I hope with you.

I was told that Jody walked around the building basically harassing people.\n\nAlso, I was peripherally connected to a person who was one air crew of Paul Allen's planes and he said that Jody Allen's kids were all a bunch of entitled brats.  He said Paul was okay, but that most of the rest were really entitled.  \n\nMaybe her name should be Karen?\n\n### Comment ID if0zdsy with +5 score by [(dukeofmadnessmotors, Reddit, 2022-07-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/vs5fqn/why_do_people_dislike_jody_allen_so_much/if0zdsy/) (in reply to ID iezkuki):\nI worked with a company owned by Paul Allen and interacted with him and Bert Kolde.

I think she's done a poor job of handling the Seahawks as well. People like to say that Paul Allen deferred to the experts, but he wasn't afraid to rock the boat.

He wasn’t a football guy (more of a basketball fan) but he bought the Seahawks so they wouldn’t leave Seattle. He bought and kept open a lotta local little historical places like a computer museum and the cinerama. He also had a very hands on approach to the Seahawks where the community trusted his leadership. He definitely had points of conflict with the community, people either loved or hated his Seattle Commons idea to build a Central Park using the cities money but his land (people thought he should fund it himself and pointed out he was developing all the surrounding land) and his rich neighbors got annoyed the way he treated Lake Washington as his own personal pond (tho the stories are just funny to everyone else). However, ultimately Paul’s behavior made him someone people looked up to and that’s not the same for Jody. She’s been shutting down his program and has shown disinterest in properties like the Seahawks. For the Seahawks specifically given the timing she’s an easy person to blame\n\n## Comment ID ifh898g with +1 score by [(snokesroomate, Reddit, 2022-07-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/vs5fqn/why_do_people_dislike_jody_allen_so_much/ifh898g/) (in reply to ID vs5fqn):\nI like her.

I've also seen them on green ways with bike paths right next to them. So awesome!\n\nBut I saw the street car in south lake union (the SLUT) the other day stuck behind an unoccupied car that had parked too far out into the lane and was blocking the tracks. The street car just had to sit there indefinitely whereas a bus could just go around easily. Additionally the street car is subject to traffic lights and typical traffic...and it seems to take a long time to build and a lot of money to install. To me, the street car in Seattle is basically just a big bus that's subject to a track. \n\nSo if it's not gonna be in a dedicated travel lane or space, why have street cars at all? Buses seem cheaper and more practical for Seattle. \n\nWhat am I missing?\n\n## Comment ID ic94hm0 with +242 score by [(Greedy_Craft, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic94hm0/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nOff topic but the First Hill streetcar is so slow that I literally outrun it during my morning jogs lol.\n\n### Comment ID ic95ovf with +133 score by [(blahcubed, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic95ovf/) (in reply to ID ic94hm0):\nI have outpaced the SLUT walking casually.\n\n#### Comment ID ic9axcp with +50 score by [(thearchiguy, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic9axcp/) (in reply to ID ic95ovf):\nHey now.

It isn't individual to just Seattle -- basically all of the 2010's modern USA streetcar (not light rail) projects have failed. In DC, Atlanta etc... The high construction costs meant the streetcars couldn't travel anywhere far.\n\nCompared to the BRT (lite) routes which have become much more useful in Seattle itself and say in Oakland's BRT, Richmond VA's BRT, etc.. which have had much better ridership and also with the vastly cheaper construction costs been able to reach much more useful destinations than being a 1/2 mile neighborhood loop.\n\nThat being said, I will note that the dedicated transit lane on Westlake the 40 and C bus use were basically only achieved because of the streetcar.

Busses usually cost more than a street car, are less energy efficient, and less dense with riders. Street cars have a psychological benefit of a sense of permanency that busses don't which tend to spur more business investment along the route than would happen with a new bus route. So economically, streetcars *tend* to be cheaper over a longer period.\n\nStreet cars have some soft benefits over busses as well such as being more easily understood, more comfortable, quieter, environmentally cleaner, spend less time at stops and more time moving, and are usually have better ridership.\n\nThat being said busses are great too. Relatively they're extremely cheap and quick to deploy. Cities can throw up new bus routes with decent stops in almost no time and very little upfront capital. Streetcar extensions take at least 5 years, often times getting as high as 15 years and cost a fortune upfront.\n\nMy opinion is that the city be focusing on deploying bus routes heavily across the city while simultaneously working on street car extensions in the most dense areas.

Load/unload times that are a bit faster don't mean much when someone can walk faster than taking the street car in the first place. So that leaves us with tourists being more likely to use them. \n\nIn other words, they are fancy vanity projects that benefit nearby businesses, at best. They are absolutely not \"mass transit\".

A streetcar can in theory move more people than an articulated bus since it can have multiple cars. A streetcar is also more comfortable than a bus typically so once again, if you're going to run a high volume route without wanting to dig a subway tunnel the streetcar is a good alternative to buses as you could run 1 street (with one employee) over say 2-3 buses.\n\nNeither of these really apply much to the streetcars in Seattle.\n\n## Comment ID icbcg1l with +3 score by [(quietletmethink, Reddit, 2022-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/icbcg1l/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nTldr I'm an urbanist asshole who just doesn't understand the struggles of living with 2 cars in a single family home in suburbia. \n\nThere's a lot of hostility in this thread towards public transit as a whole. Also weird the way people are derogatorily using \"urbanist.\"\n\nI think any incidental failing of transit will be used as an excuse to crucify the whole system. People who are concerned about their lifestyle, especially when that lifestyle revolves around a car, feel threatened by talk of expanding transit and closing off areas from cars. Obviously, this prevents progress.\n\nTangentially, it's incredible how some people will mock gun enthusiasts but turn around and try to hang onto cars. \"Muh guns\" turns into \"muh subaru,\" but people don't see the irony in that they're defending the deadlier machine. Personally, I'm not big on either. \n\nThat might be a little too meta though, so to directly answer your question OP, Seattle's implementation of streetcars has been pretty lackluster. This is in part due to the programs being gutted by NIMBYs and likely exacerbated by the number of cars on the road. \n\nI'm not sure where in SLU this happened but ideally streetcar lines should run down the center of the street, with car lanes on either side, and parking should always be at least a lane or two away from the streetcar. The situation you described shouldn't happen with proper implementation. \n\nBusses certainly have a number of advantages over streetcars, especially the more environmentally friendly electrified buses. Like you said, they have more mobility options, and it's easier to reroute things if there's construction or an accident or so on. A lot of buses also fit people more efficiently than a streetcar.  \n\nBut on the other hand, buses destroy their own infrastructure very quickly, have longer boarding/offloading times, and are harder to automate. \n\nI think the ultimate answer to transit in Seattle is to use both. Buses can serve more far-flung areas and bring people in and out of the city center, while streetcars should be used to connect major destinations within the city.\n\n## Comment ID icbvm6x with +3 score by [(marssaxman, Reddit, 2022-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/icbvm6x/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nSeattle did not build the South Lake Union Trolley because it made sense as part of a comprehensive transit network. Rather, developers who owned property in SLU built it, in order to promote the neighborhood as an up-and-coming destination so that their new buildings would be successful. \n\nSimilarly, Seattle did not build the First Hill Streetcar because it made sense as part of a comprehensive transit network. Rather, Sound Transit built it in order to settle a lawsuit, after they cut the originally-planned First Hill station from the light rail line. Its function is to provide rail access from First Hill to either the Capitol Hill station or the International District station.\n\nThere was a proposal to connect these two lines using a dedicated lane on 1st Avenue downtown.

I'm all for improving transit as well as pedestrian and bicycle facilities but coming at it from a strictly anti-car angle is politically foolish and anyone that suggests otherwise comes off as delusional.\n\n## Comment ID ica2teu with +2 score by [(AcclaimedGroundhog, Reddit, 2022-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ica2teu/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nNeeds a dedicated, physically separated lane for buses and streetcar only.\n\nOtherwise it's a waste.\n\n## Comment ID ica8rwm with +2 score by [(Bretmd, Reddit, 2022-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ica8rwm/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nSeattle has a streetcar because lots of other cities were doing streetcars so Seattle wanted to have one in order to sit at the popular kids lunch table. \n\nThen Seattle built it in a way that doesn’t serve riders. \n\nNow, in all ironies, sound transit is looking at changing the entire routing of the Ballard light rail in order to not temporarily shut down the SLUT.

Also add on how short the line is and the lack of connections to other transit lines (pretty much the only hub would be at Westlake station)\n\nWhy was it built? The SLU Streetcar was a vanity project for Paul Allen with his redevelopment of that neighborhood.  He effectively contributed half of the cost via LID taxes. (https://seattletransitblog.com/2017/12/15/seattles-streetcar-turns-10/)\n\nWhen the streetcar first opened, it had even worse performance than what you see now because it didn't have any dedicated transit lanes.  Not that the dedicated lanes today help too much since it still has to contend with right-turning cars, especially at Denny Way.\n\nIt eventually got semi-decent ridership during rush hour with the Amazon crowd up until Rapidride C was extended to run down Westlake. After that it made zero sense to take the streetcar over the Rapidride.  Which really proved that a bus makes way more sense in this corridor.\n\nThe only place I've seen a \"successful\" streetcar system that also has to contend with traffic is in Toronto.  That streetcar system has some insane ridership, but that's also because the lines travel through high density areas and have many transit connections.  They're certainly not fast, but the vehicles are massive and as such they are very cost-effective over buses at their ridership level.\n\n## Comment ID icammv0 with +1 score by [(fucktysonfoods, Reddit, 2022-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/icammv0/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nClose off all of downtown and Capitol Hill to cars and bring back horse drawn carriages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comment ID ic9g2v0 with +1 score by [(seattlecyclone, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic9g2v0/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nA streetcar doesn't move anyone anywhere any faster than a bus running over the same surface. A streetcar sharing a lane with cars can get stuck in traffic the same way a bus sharing a lane with cars can get stuck in traffic. Similarly, giving the streetcar its own lane speeds it up exactly as much as a bus would be sped up on that same route by painting a bus lane.\n\nStreetcars are seen as a nicer ride than buses, so the politics of devoting dedicated lanes to them may be a bit easier in certain cases, but we've failed at that for most (all?) of our existing routes so not very relevant here. Streetcars are also larger than buses, so they can be useful to deploy on routes where you'd otherwise need to run a bus every minute or three...again not very relevant here. \n\nGiven all that I'd err on the side of using limited transit funds to improve bus service and/or accelerate Link development. Streetcars just seem like they don't currently have much of a niche here to be worth the cost.\n\n## Comment ID ic9g47q with +1 score by [(WelcomeTheLahar, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic9g47q/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nHow could a terrible idea cost $285 million to implement?\n\n## Comment ID ic9l986 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic9l986/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nwhat do you mean?!?!

Not just SLU.\n\nThe irony is that Seattle used to have streetcars and we paved over the lines.\n\nRegardless of all that, we have them now so hopefully we can make them work.

Jody Allen wasn't chosen, we're simply stuck with her because Paul died. The only way that changes is if she chooses to sell the team, which some seem to think is going to happen. In the event of a trade for Watson, however, there would be several people in team leadership making the conscious decision to go out and get him.\n\nThey both suck, but the team actually has a say on whether or not Watson will be involved with the team, and I know I'll be disappointed if they choose to bring him on board.\n\n### Comment ID i0idqj7 with +17 score by [(Youronlysunshine42, Reddit, 2022-03-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/td5cgz/exbodyguards_accuse_jody_allen_of_sexual/i0idqj7/) (in reply to ID i0hlmmf):\nIt really speaks ill of everyone in the organization if Watson is allowed to become part of it.

No one here is defending Jodie Allen and in fact I think we all want her out.\n2. The accusations against her are not comparable. Allen is accused of things like buying her bodyguards \"skimpy\" swimsuits and suggesting they get in the hot tub with her while she was in her underwear, both of which are scummy but not illegal. Watson is accused of physical sexual assault by over 20 women. There is no legitimate comparison to be made between their actions.\n\nYou probably know both of those things already though and this post wasn't made in good faith.

The Vulcan lawsuit was a civil suit that settled out of court and never had a criminal investigation. The allegations against Vulcan were sexual harassment, not sexual assault. Jody was accused of having fashion shows and undressing in front of bodyguards.\n\nIn contrast, Watson was accused of coercing massages therapists into performing sexual acts. Moreover, he was under criminal investigation for multiple accounts of sexual assault, and he admitted to most everything but the coercion. \n\nBoth cases are gross.

Watson trade wouldn’t end my fandom, it’d piss me right the fuck off and I’d tell everyone that asked “I love my hawks but Jody Allen can jump in front of a bus”\n\nOne can zoom out and find all sorts of things that each fan base should not support a team over. I abhor any Chiefs fan that dons a Tyreek jersey because he hit a pregnant woman…and that organization still allows him to suit up and play in front of tens of thousands cheering fans all because he can run fast? Cool. So as long as your are productive than, you can hit whomever you want if you are a Chief. But that’s not fair to the whole fan base because I’m sure there are a ton of people (going out on a limb here for humanity sake) who don’t support Tyreek for being able to play too. \n\nAre KC fans wrong for cheering their team on or it is possible, just maybe, to like the team as a whole and simultaneously despise individuals? Are Patriot fans not allowed to cheer on their team because Kraft got a handy in a massage parlor? Or Commanders fans not allowed to be fans despite Snyders multiple scandals and racist remarks? \n\nBy all means, if we are going to use consistency as a scope of argument then we should all never watch a game again.

I don’t want him on my team because my fandom is a personal investment of time and money into the product on the field. I don’t really care about the teams ownership group. I don’t think about them. I do think about the players. I root for them to do well. I suffer their failures. I like to discuss them. I don’t want to do that for deshaun Watson. \n\nIf I was making a moral stance I wouldn’t watch the NFL. it’s way too problematic of a league. But that’s not my issue with Watson. My issue with Watson is I find what he’s done to be too far for me to ignore and I don’t want to invest the personal effort of my fandom towards him directly. I’m not taking a stand, I just don’t have the motivation to be a fan of a piece of Shit of his caliber and would rather spend that energy doing something else. I don’t want to deal with other fanbases bringing him up. I don’t really want to talk about him at all. \n\nThe owner of the team never got that energy from me.

They do love the Blazers and Timbers, and sport is huge in the state in general.\n\nThe Portland metro area is probably large and wealthy enough. I feel like NHL hockey would have appeal as something new and different, which kind of fits with the eclectic attitude of the city, and the a lot of the state for that matter. \n\nThe biggest unknown is if there's enough interest to go around between the Blazers and the NHL. I just never knew anyone, friends, or co-workers, that had ever even given hockey a single thought. It would be a pretty raw market to develop fans in—similar to Vegas imo. A lot of fans would support the team because it's a Portland pro sports team and not because it's hockey.\n\n### Comment ID e1k94dz with +5 score by [(RoloTamassi, Reddit, 2018-06-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/8v1y5y/do_you_think_that_portland_could_support_an_nhl/e1k94dz/) (in reply to ID e1jwwzy):\nAlso from the GTA (Guelph represent) living in Portland.

Portland could very much support a NHL hockey team. They consistently have some of the highest attendances for the WHL and if the support of the Timbers/Thorns is to be used as any indication of how well a NHL team will be supported I think Portland would be a great NHL city.

The Portland metropolitan area has a population of around 2.45 million, and out of the 50 biggest metro areas in the United States it is ranked 15th in population growth. That gives it a bigger population than the metro areas supporting the Jets, Sabres, Hurricanes, Oilers, Senators, Flames, Predators, Blue Jackets, Golden Knights, and Penguins.\n\nPortland is certainly big enough to support a team, the question is if it would do so. Atlanta is the 10th largest metropolitan area in the United States and Canada, with a metro population of 5.79 million, yet the NHL failed to keep a team in Atlanta *twice* (the Flames were there from 1972 to 1980, and the Thrashers were there from 1999 to 2011). \n\nCould it?

So I don't know how to assess the success of a scenario that can't really realistically exist. \n  \nPortland's populous enough, if the infrastructure, the plan and the circumstances (the right stadium,promotion, owners, etc.) supported it.  We've seen via Vegas how tremendously well an expansion/relocation can do even outside a \"traditional hockey market\" with the right plan.  But none of that is guaranteed.

This makes people dislike the idea more knowing that much money is going somewhere else, and the council doesn't want a new arena built (the mayor has vowed to  build as much \"affordable housing\" as he can).

It’s just that her ownership sort of coincided with Dame aging and us having to go into a rebuild but I think she’s far from the reason our basketball team sucks.\n\n### Comment ID lcndcq8 with +32 score by [(Responsible-Knee6288, Reddit, 2024-07-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/1e0ddo5/now_that_we_have_the_new_media_deal/lcndcq8/) (in reply to ID lcmehmf):\nFans legit talk about her like she killed Paul to get the team\n\n### Comment ID lcp4lvv with +14 score by [(mm825, Reddit, 2024-07-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/1e0ddo5/now_that_we_have_the_new_media_deal/lcp4lvv/) (in reply to ID lcmehmf):\nPeople on this sub act like old ass Phil Knight knows how to evaluate draft prospects\n\n## Comment ID lcma9zf with +26 score by [(Goducks91, Reddit, 2024-07-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/1e0ddo5/now_that_we_have_the_new_media_deal/lcma9zf/) (in reply to ID 1e0ddo5):\nY’all are so obsessed with Jody selling.

Currents ebb and flow. A tide cannot \"pull your ship in a full 360 circle\".\n\n> A 30 foot boat should lay out around 50 feet of anchor line (most of which sits on the bottom).\n\nSo if you're anchoring in 40 feet of water you only need 50 feet of rode?\n\nAlso- most of it should not be sitting on the bottom. The only way that would happen is if there was no wind or current, you were using a chain rode, and you had a ton of scope. Heck [even the picture you linked to](http://ephemerisle.org/index.php/Anchoring) doesn't show the rode sitting on the bottom.\n\n> At 330 feet, we're talking about a 1000 feet of heavy chain to keep that ship in place.\n\nI'm sorry but where are you coming up with these numbers?\n\nI've sailed my entire life and I've never once heard anything like this. The amount of rode you pay out is dependent on depth and desired scope. Scope is determined primarily by weather conditions and bottom composition (though duration of stay and whether or not you will be aboard are also factors). The only time the size of the vessel is taken into account is if it has a lot of windage- e.g. a tall cruise ship versus a low slung tanker and that's still largely a weather concern- not really a ship size concern.\n\nA heavy chain rode needs less scope than a nylon rode or a combination rode- but it still doesn't have anything to do with the vessel's length. Chain is used because it artificially increases the scope of the rode near the anchor and helps keep it set.\n\nHere is West Marine's page on selecting an anchor rode:\n\nhttp://www.westmarine.com/WestAdvisor/Selecting-An-Anchor-Rode\n\nScroll to the bottom. They mention the thickness/strength of the rode as a function of the size of the vessel- but not the length of the rode. Specifically:\n\n\"In general the load on an anchor line varies with the square of the LOA of the boat. A high windage, heavy displacement boat such as a trawler or fishing boat will require heavier anchor rode than an ultra-light racing sailboat of the same LOA.\"\n\n> the buoyancy of the hull makes a larger ship harder to anchor\n\nThis statement doesn't make any sense. Did you mean the _displacement_ of the hull of a larger ship makes it harder to anchor?\n\n#### Comment ID czfw3r6 with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2016-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/435paw/microsoft_cofounders_yacht_tears_up_protected/czfw3r6/) (in reply to ID czfujts):\n> At 330 feet, we're talking about a 1000 feet of heavy chain to keep that ship in place (the buoyancy of the hull makes a larger ship harder to anchor).\n\nThe _buoyancy of the hull_?\n\nPlease cite your source for this claim because, frankly, it's a load of bollocks.\n\nThe size of the ship determines anchor size and strength of the rode. The length of the rode is determined by the scope and the depth of the water. The scope is determined by bottom composition, weather, and duration of stay (among other things).\n\n#### Comment ID czfvphs with +4 score by [(polonium269, Reddit, 2016-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/435paw/microsoft_cofounders_yacht_tears_up_protected/czfvphs/) (in reply to ID czfujts):\nAn \"experienced sailor\" also knows the difference between a \"map\" and what sailors use are charts sir.\n\n#### Comment ID czfxipp with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2016-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/435paw/microsoft_cofounders_yacht_tears_up_protected/czfxipp/) (in reply to ID czfujts):\n> The Cayman Islands need to clearly mark these areas with buoys or have their customs officer hand out accurate maps.\n\nJust so you know- sailors use charts- not maps.\n\n#### Comment ID czg0qef with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2016-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/435paw/microsoft_cofounders_yacht_tears_up_protected/czg0qef/) (in reply to ID czfujts):\n> we had a briefing telling us good anchor spots and were given a map.\n\nYou were given a chart, not a map. Drivers use maps. Sailors use charts.\n\n> ...but these aren't GPS accurate maps.\n\nActually many of these charts are \"GPS accurate\". Some things on the chart like sunken rocks may not be precisely plotted- but a reef is large enough and would be pretty accurate.\n\n> Additionally, depending on how you anchor, the current and tide can pull your ship in a full 360 circle around your anchor point.\n\nOk- currents ebb and flow. Tides rise and fall. Tides cannot \"pull your ship in a full 360 degree circle\".\n\n> What's more, the larger the ship, the longer your anchor line needs to be.\n\nThis is patently untrue. The length of your rode depends on depth and scope. As others have pointed out- scope is a function of your ground tackle, the composition of the bottom (holding power), the weather, the duration of stay, and a host of other factors. The only thing even slightly related to this is windage- which is still a function of weather moreso than ship size.\n\nLarger ships have larger anchors and stronger (and heavier) anchor rodes. The anchor holds the chain and the chain holds the ship- sort of. The reason you use a chain anchor rode is that it is heavy and it will sag which creates an artificially larger scope. In that sense the chain holds the anchor and the ship.\n\n>  A 30 foot boat at 20 feet depth needs to lay out around 100 feet of anchor line\n\nThe size of the vessel is irrelevant here. In fact- the web site you linked to doesn't mention the size of the vessel at all except when it comes to sizing the ground tackle.\n\n> At 330 feet, we're talking about a 1000 feet of heavy chain to keep that ship in place\n\nAgain- the size of the ship has nothing to do with the length of the chain used to anchor it. The weight/size of the chain is relevant because it determines the holding power- but not the length.\n\n> the buoyancy of the hull makes a larger ship harder to anchor\n\nThis is just completely wrong. By your logic a 480' long, 18,750 ton Ohio class submarine that is neutrally buoyant would be _easier_ to anchor than a 25' long, 3 ton positively buoyant pleasure boat?\n\nLook- I don't know who you are- but you are most definitely not a sailor.\n\n#### Comment ID czfutui with +3 score by [(randomly-generated, Reddit, 2016-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/435paw/microsoft_cofounders_yacht_tears_up_protected/czfutui/) (in reply to ID czfujts):\nHow often do chains just get stuck on shit and lost?

We anchored outside in the Virgin Gorda area, not sure of the exact location, same island as the Fat Virgin restaurant. Pretty much, we tried to anchor since all the moorings were taken and there was a tiny reef right under us and we didnt realize until the anchor was halfway down. It was just a duo hall catamaran, but still. We quickly, and carefully, raised the anchor and found another spot. It was pretty dangerous for our sail boat, too. \n\nP.S.

The pilot missed the specified anchorage placing the ship in a live coral area.\n\n5) The Tatoosh is reported to have damaged coral in the West Bay Replenishment zone, which is about 5 miles north of Georgetown. It is questionable if the Port Captain would have been providing anchoring instructions in this area.\n\n6) The coast where Tatoosh is reported to have been has a sharp dropoff, thus a limited anchoring area.  Looking at the chart as I write, the depth goes from 20 feet to 1000 feet in a distance of 900 yards.\n\n7) A captain will do everything possible to avoid anchoring in coral, as it is very poor holding, and anchor chains are prone to get wrapped in the coral heads.\n\n8) The charts for this location do not indicate coral once you are past 300 yards from shore, at which point the depth is 15 feet.\n\n## Comment ID czfwn9o with +24 score by [(bludvein, Reddit, 2016-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/435paw/microsoft_cofounders_yacht_tears_up_protected/czfwn9o/) (in reply to ID 435paw):\nPeople reacting without even reading the article.

Apparently he was having it delivered, but the boat was too big to make it through some of the locks along the route, so rather than back tracking and choosing another route, it was decided that they would airlift the yacht straight in to Seattle (I'm assuming Seattle because Microsoft and that's where my business partner is from).  Now, the only problem was that the yacht was so big that they needed to use two helicopters to bring it in.  Besides the fact that flying two helicopters near each other is incredibly difficult and dangerous, these are also both attached to a giant boat.\n\nSo as they're approaching Allen's mansion, which is - as I'm told at the time - on a pebble beach, one of the straps used to lift the boat starts to give way until finally the whole thing snaps, dropping the yacht, ass end first... on to the pebble beach, which is now a rock tsunami.  Stones are flying all over the place, the two helicopters barely make it out, and I don't know if anyone was injured.\n\nHoly hell, I just looked up info on his yachts, thinking that it would be easy to confirm or deny the validity of this story and he has a lot of yachts.\n\n## Comment ID czg6qgg with +2 score by [(fireybawlz, Reddit, 2016-01-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/435paw/microsoft_cofounders_yacht_tears_up_protected/czg6qgg/) (in reply to ID 435paw):\nPaul Allen?

Two years ago he parked his monstrosity of a yacht Octopus about 400-500 yards off Seven Mile Beach and left it there for over a week, right in the middle of some of the most popular public scuba diving areas on that side of the island. It was a huge inconvenience for a lot of the local dive shops who frequent those reefs and an eyesore for all the beach goers on Seven Mile (it was cool for about a day but after a few days it was just an annoyance).

Groups working in niche fields built up capabilities only to have their efforts redirected by whoever the latest manager was who had no domain expertise. Managers were brought in based on their credentials at the biggest tech companies but the strategies they learned there were inappropriate to the size, scope, and audience of Vulcan projects.  Imagine a 2 person 6 month research project. Now bring in 3 managers who insist on making the prototype 'enterprise grade', halting progress. Be sure to berate the engineers on their way out. Projects managers focus more on reporting progress than progressing. I've never been at an organization which spends the amount of effort this one does to tell employees how great it is to work there. I wish I left sooner.",

It's a culture of fear that will not change because it comes directly from Paul Allen. \"Owner meetings\" as they are called are unpredictable and can go well or poorly depending on Paul's mood. Senior management operates on his whim and therefore the company lacks strategy and clear level-headed directional planning. Senior management will do anything to keep their well-paying jobs: they repeatedly move/alter project goals/direction and blame their employees when projects don't go as planned. Self-preservation at Vulcan is senior management's primary goal.  A series of poor hires at the C-suite level have sent the company reeling. The technology department, in particular, is in upheaval and the new leader has a complete disregard for his team. Company morale has taken another massive beating.",

He was very positive and enthusiastic about what we are doing, and it felt very validating. Great and recently improved benefits and vacation + great location across from the stadiums.

          "cons": "I’m also very happy to have left. Vulcan lacks paying customers. Without that simple but powerful force, it is hard to keep a company pointed toward true north.\r\n\r\nIn my five years in the tech department, it had about three name changes and 4-6 leadership changes. With each regime change I would feel a new sense of hope. “This guy (note: always a guy) seems like he understands business. He’s not just interested in creating a wacky invention, but he wants to make products for actual human beings.” Inevitably, users would fall to the wayside and we would ultimately build something for a white guy sitting in an ivory tower. While Mr. Allen had good intentions and creative ideas, he often wanted a cutting edge engineering solution to a big humanitarian problem. The non-engineering solutions were too dull. But the engineering solutions were often out of touch.\r\n\r\nOne thing was consistent: the worker bees were passionate about making something amazing and functional. Similar to Mr. Allen, they wanted to make a big impact in people’s’ lives. They researched ways to make science fiction come to life. They are smart, kind, creative, sharing people. However, the people who get promoted spout empty promises. They strut in like Donald Trump, fabricating business models and customer needs.\r\n\r\nIn some ways, it's hard to fault these leaders. When there is no business, then lying with flourish is the best way to personally survive. If they can’t be successful by making a sale, then success has to come from a bloated sense of self worth.\r\n\r\nIn the last regime change, things have gone slightly differently. The customer we designed for was no longer Paul Allen but instead a nonexistent customer who wants futuristic products at a reasonable price. In trying to productize Paul’s ideas, they are taking something developed in a lab and trying to make it a commodity, underfunding any R&amp;D that would maintain differentiation.\r\n\r\nLeadership isn’t taking a strong stance in any direction:\r\n- If it truly wanted to build products, it would expand the team size to function comparably to a competitor. Right now, teams of 2-10 people are trying to create a full scale business.\r\n- If it wanted to operate as a tech transfer office, it would partner with major companies. Instead, it keeps its tech development under wraps.\r\n- If it wanted to be a Google X, it would focus on R&amp;D and build truly futuristic product prototypes and not worry about making a sale.\r\n\r\nVulcan doesn’t know what it is. It never has. It always sat in a technological purgatory, partially because I don’t think Mr. Allen cared enough to commercialize. Without Paul Allen, it loses a leader that had a sci-fi imagination. That might be a good thing since his ideas never touched the ground. It might be a bad thing because there are no longer any ideas.\r\n\r\nRight now, it is trying to commoditize futuristic ideas for an imaginary customer. Best of luck.",

Vertical communication, up and down, is not healthy: there is some \"yes\"-men/women mentality, and I think honesty in interactions suffer for that. Despite being an organization owned by a billionaire, there is an unreasonable financial austerity when it comes to HR that can sometimes stifle growth of employees and success of projects. In my opinion, the performance appraisal process here is very counterproductive. Employees are graded on a curve (remember college courses?) HR rejects the notion of \"stack ranking\", but under the hood, managers have to stack rank to determine how their teams members are distributed under the curve. The curve is determined by how well the company and department has been rated that year. The PA and goal-setting processes together extend over several months.",

Anticipate more cuts, and don't be surprised if the company eventually folds entirely.\r\n\r\nThere were so many long term employees who had dedicated decades (yes, 20+ years) of their careers to this company. They were committed and passionate, and were tossed aside in often quite disrespectful ways. After so many rounds of layoffs, it was truly disheartening to see how incompetently our HR team continued to handle these events. Executives with flippant attitudes towards the process, and decisions made based on politics and personal whims of the Chair. Your success at Vulcan is not dictated by what you know or accomplish, but rather how in favor you are with the top leaders. As one person had commented upon leaving, they had never seen politics to this degree at any previous company, regardless of size.\r\n\r\nBottom line... proceed with extreme caution.",

In my opinion, the performance appraisal process here is very counterproductive. Employees are graded on a curve (remember college courses?)

Without that simple but powerful force, it is hard to keep a company pointed toward true north.\r\n\r\nIn my five years in the tech department, it had about three name changes and 4-6 leadership changes. With each regime change I would feel a new sense of hope. “This guy (note: always a guy) seems like he understands business. He’s not just interested in creating a wacky invention, but he wants to make products for actual human beings.” Inevitably, users would fall to the wayside and we would ultimately build something for a white guy sitting in an ivory tower. While Mr. Allen had good intentions and creative ideas, he often wanted a cutting edge engineering solution to a big humanitarian problem. The non-engineering solutions were too dull. But the engineering solutions were often out of touch.\r\n\r\nOne thing was consistent: the worker bees were passionate about making something amazing and functional. Similar to Mr. Allen, they wanted to make a big impact in people’s’ lives. They researched ways to make science fiction come to life. They are smart, kind, creative, sharing people. However, the people who get promoted spout empty promises. They strut in like Donald Trump, fabricating business models and customer needs.\r\n\r\nIn some ways, it's hard to fault these leaders. When there is no business, then lying with flourish is the best way to personally survive. If they can’t be successful by making a sale, then success has to come from a bloated sense of self worth.\r\n\r\nIn the last regime change, things have gone slightly differently. The customer we designed for was no longer Paul Allen but instead a nonexistent customer who wants futuristic products at a reasonable price. In trying to productize Paul’s ideas, they are taking something developed in a lab and trying to make it a commodity, underfunding any R&amp;D that would maintain differentiation.\r\n\r\nLeadership isn’t taking a strong stance in any direction:\r\n- If it truly wanted to build products, it would expand the team size to function comparably to a competitor. Right now, teams of 2-10 people are trying to create a full scale business.\r\n- If it wanted to operate as a tech transfer office, it would partner with major companies. Instead, it keeps its tech development under wraps.\r\n- If it wanted to be a Google X, it would focus on R&amp;D and build truly futuristic product prototypes and not worry about making a sale.\r\n\r\nVulcan doesn’t know what it is. It never has. It always sat in a technological purgatory, partially because I don’t think Mr. Allen cared enough to commercialize. Without Paul Allen, it loses a leader that had a sci-fi imagination. That might be a good thing since his ideas never touched the ground. It might be a bad thing because there are no longer any ideas.\r\n\r\nRight now, it is trying to commoditize futuristic ideas for an imaginary customer. Best of luck.",

They ran a perimeter of a 5k and 10k of downtown Mount Airy and there used to be a rock concert at the end. But this year they are shaking things up!\n\n\"Over the years there's a lot of music that happens in downtown Mount Airy now., 17 years later.\" said Melissa Hiatt on the United Fund of Surry, \"So we've had to get creative with the rocks part of the title. Throughout the years, we've added some music along the pathway, which is a little difficult to do. So we decided this year to take a spin on Ernest T Bass and throw some rocks with some children!\"\n\nBut how does that work?\n\n\"There's a 50-yard dash after the 5k and 10k that the kids can run and it's down South Main Street. What we will do is have them run down the street, have window panes without glass in them and rubber rocks from Vulcan Inc. for them to throw a rock through the window\", continued Hiatt, \"When they get the rock through the window, they'll turn around and run by just to add a little fun for the kids to see something that you're not supposed to do normally.\"\n\nThe event has been successful in the past but expectations are high this year.\n\n\"Over the past 17 years, the average is about $30 ,000 that we've raised for United Fund Agencies.\" said Hiatt, \"We support 25 member nonprofit agencies that provide human services in Surry County to our citizens.

      "# [Baldwin County launches FAME Chapter to boost local manufacturing workforce by WHISPER EDWARDSEditorial Assistantwhisper@gulfcoastmedia.com on 2024-09-19](https://gulfcoastmedia.com/stories/baldwin-county-launches-fame-chapter-to-boost-local-manufacturing-workforce,233672)\nA new chapter of the Federation for Advanced Manufacturing Education (FAME) is launching in Baldwin County, bringing an innovative workforce development initiative to the heart of Alabama's manufacturing sector.\n\nDubbed \"FAME Built By Baldwin,\" the local FAME chapter is designed to create a pipeline of highly skilled workers ready to meet the demands of modern industry.\n\nThe initiative, a collaboration between 10 local manufacturing partners and Coastal Alabama Community College, aims to cultivate top-tier technicians through a hands-on work-study program. The program's structure allows students to gain both academic knowledge and practical experience, making it a powerful tool for producing globally competitive, multiskilled workers.\n\n\"We are so excited to have launched this initiative in August this year with our first student cohort starting in August 2025,\" said Jennifer Crawford, Vice President of Human Resources at Vulcan Inc. \"As we begin this new chapter, we are not only opening the doors to a new academic program at Coastal Alabama Community College but also affirming our dedication to providing a continuous talent pool to the industry involved. Our aim is to cultivate a future workforce that meets our evolving needs and equips those future FAME students with the skills and knowledge necessary for successful careers in manufacturing and industry.\"\n\nStudents in the FAME program will split their time between the classroom and real-world work experience. They will attend classes at Coastal Alabama Community College part of the week, and then part of the week at a sponsoring company. These companies, which include The Baldwin County employers sponsoring students include Vulcan, E-Covery, Gulf Packaging, Novelis, Quincy Compressors, Segers Aviation, Collins Inc., Saunders Yachtworks, Kaishan Compressor USA and Coca-Cola Bottling Co., will provide students with hands-on training in areas such as mechanical equipment, electrical controls, robotics and motor controls.\n\nThe competitive recruitment process for the first cohort of students will begin in spring 2025, with classes starting in the fall of that year. Those selected will have the opportunity to earn an Advanced Manufacturing Technician (AMT) credential, setting them up for success in a range of industries.\n\n\"Students participating in the FAME Built By Baldwin cohort will receive hands-on experience with mechanical equipment, electrical controls, robotics, pneumatics, hydraulics, PLCs, motor controls, etc. three days per week at their sponsoring employer's facility and two days per week of classroom learning,\" Crawford said. \"This hybrid on-the-job/classroom component is what makes FAME unique and provides that tactical learning element that many curriculums miss.\"",
      "# [Wikipedia by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2003-06-17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechTV)\nCable channel\n\nTelevision channel\n\nTechTV was a 24-hour cable and satellite channel based in San Francisco featuring news and shows about computers, technology, and the Internet. In 2004, it merged with the G4 gaming channel which ultimately dissolved TechTV programming. At the height of its six-year run, TechTV was broadcast in 70 countries, reached 43 million households, and claimed 1.9 million unique visitors monthly to its website.[1] A focus on personality-driven product reviews and technical support made it a cultural hub for technology information worldwide, still existing today online through its former hosts' webcasts, most notably the TWiT Network.\n\nThe offices were located at 650 Townsend Street, 94103,[2] and the studios, of which there were two, were located at 535 York Street, 94110.[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nOrigins\n\n[edit]\n\nOn August 20, 1994, computer magazine publisher Ziff Davis entered the television industry with the premiere of The Personal Computing Show, a program that aired on Saturday mornings on CNBC, America's Talking and the Jones Computing Network. The Personal Computing Show, co-hosted by Jim Louderback and Gina Smith, targeted a growing demographic of personal computer owners and demonstrated how to purchase, install, maintain and repair personal computers and peripheral devices such as printers. Shortly after The Personal Computing Show's premiere, Ziff Davis revealed plans to produce a second show in October 1994 named PC Update, a half-hour Sunday morning news program hosted by Leo Laporte and focusing on the computer industry.[4][5] According to Ziff Davis spokesman Gregory Jarboe, The Personal Computing Show was unsuccessful due to its relegation to odd channels and timeslots.[6] When Ziff Davis' sale to investment firm Forstmann Little & Company was announced in October 1994, a small Foster City-based television operation named \"ZD-TV\" was listed as a company asset.[7]\n\nIn April 1996, Ziff Davis announced the establishment of ZDTV as a San Francisco-based unit specializing in the production of television and internet broadcasts, which would allow the publisher to showcase its products. Its first project was to develop The Site, a daily hour-long prime time news show co-hosted by Soledad O'Brien about the increasing social and economic effects of technology. The program aired on the cable news network MSNBC, which launched on July 15, 1996.[8][9] It was the third San Francisco-based television program specializing in technology after CNET Central and Cyberlife.[10] According to Ziff Davis chief executive Larry Wangberg,[6] San Francisco was chosen as ZDTV's headquarters for its proximity to Silicon Valley and easy access to Multimedia Gulch-based talent.[11]\n\nOn May 6, 1997, Ziff Davis announced its plan to launch ZDTV as a 24-hour interactive cable network specializing in computers and the Internet. The publisher put $100 million behind the project and planned to debut the ZDTV channel in early 1998. Projected programming for the channel included talk shows on the impact of technology, business-oriented shows evaluating investments in high-tech stocks, and reviews of software and hardware.[12] Children's programming was also planned for the weekends.[13] The channel had 11 initial charter advertisers, including IBM, Gateway 2000, Microsoft, and Charles Schwab.[12] Ziff Davis chairman and CEO Eric Hippeau cited the increasing presence of computers in cable television homes and workspaces as motivation for filling the niche of programming about computers, saying \"This is a huge audience and it will only get bigger\".[13] Wangberg, who would be made the network's CEO, proclaimed Ziff Davis' ambition of ZDTV becoming \"to computing what CNN is to news, what ESPN is to sports\".[11] Although Ziff Davis intended to continue producing The Site for MSNBC following ZDTV's launch,[14] the show was canceled in September 1997 as a result of the network's shift toward an all-news format.[6][15] In December 1997, Ziff Davis revealed at the Western Cable Trade Show in Anaheim that it had secured agreements with four cable operators to carry the network: Prime Cable in Las Vegas, Harron Communications in Detroit, Televue in Georgia, and Prestige Cable in Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland.[6]\n\nZDTV\n\n[edit]\n\nZDTV was initially set to launch at the end of 1998's first quarter, but was delayed by Ziff Davis' initial public offering, which was announced on February 18.[11] The network launched on Monday May 11, 1998, on cable systems in Las Vegas, Detroit, parts of Georgia near Atlanta and parts of Maine.[16] An early adopter of ZDTV was Paul Allen's Charter Communications, which began carrying the channel in Newnan, Georgia in July 1998.[17] On August 1, 1998, ZDTV was broadcast in its native San Francisco when the channel struck a deal with DirecTV to become available on Channel 273 via the providers' satellite dishes.[18] In November 1998, Allen's holding company Vulcan Ventures invested $54 million in ZDTV, granting it a 33 percent stake in the network.[19]\n\nAlthough ZDTV was critically acclaimed, it struggled to gain a foothold in AT&T/TCI cable lineups,[20] and was deemed unprofitable. In an effort to sell company assets to reduce debt and boost its share price,[21] Ziff Davis put ZDTV up for sale on July 16, 1999. In November 1999, Vulcan purchased the remaining two-thirds in a transaction that was completed on January 21, 2000. The deal (which permitted the network to retain its name) was worth $204.8 million.[20][22] On August 21, 2000, ZDTV announced that it would be changing its name to TechTV the following month, and would simultaneously be added to AT&T and Time Warner Cable's digital cable lineups.[23][24]\n\nTechTV\n\n[edit]\n\nOn September 18, 2000, ZDTV was renamed TechTV, and a new on-air strategy was announced along with several new series including the music-technology series, AudioFile. Soon, TechTV made a huge commitment to enter into live broadcasting when it launched a nine-hour experimental news program called TechLive in April 2001. The show, which catered to day traders and business types, never caught on with TechTV's audience. In November 2001, following a massive round of layoffs, TechLive was divided into three one-hour shows. In the spring of 2002, TechLive was cut further into just one thirty-minute daily news magazine show, with a focus less on tech news and more on how technology changed people's lives.\n\nBeginning March 15, 2001, TechTV experienced repeated layoffs.[25] In 2002, Silicon Spin (an opinion forum hosted by PC Magazine editor John C. Dvorak from the original ZDTV launched in May 1998) and AudioFile (a show for digital music enthusiasts launched in August 2000) were canceled, with its hosts being absorbed onto other network programs. 2003 saw the introduction of several new shows (such as Performance, Robot Wars, and Unscrewed with Martin Sargent).\n\nTechTV was also broadcast over the air on KTQW in Wichita, Kansas until the TechTV name was dropped during the G4 merger.[26]\n\nInternational distribution\n\n[edit]\n\nA Canadian version of TechTV launched on September 7, 2001, as a joint venture of TechTV, Rogers Media, and Shaw Communications. The channel would later become G4techTV Canada to coincide with the American merger of TechTV and G4. The channel would change its name once again in mid-2009 to G4 Canada. In 2004, TechTV launched on Foxtel Digital in Australia. After the merger with G4, TechTV (then called G4techTV) left Australia lineups as its international feed ceased. On Malaysia's ASTRO platform, repeats of the international feed was run for some time after the international feed ceased before starting to import G4TV programming and retransmitting them locally on the same channel as the public educational service TV Pendidikan from 2002 to 2006. In Japan, Sony's So-net channel aired several TechTV programs until the fall of 2005 (they aired reruns after May 2004). In New Zealand, TechTV aired on Saturn Communications's channel 34 until May 2004. In addition to those countries, TechTV was broadcast internationally in the United Kingdom.\n\nMerger and consolidation\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 25, 2004, Comcast's G4 gaming channel announced a merger with TechTV. This move became hugely controversial among loyal fans of TechTV and Leo Laporte, who, because of a contract dispute with Vulcan, left the channel. Shows with Laporte, including The Screen Savers and Call for Help, continued on with remaining staff taking over his hosting duties.\n\nAround May 6, 2004, G4 announced the termination of 250 employees from the San Francisco office by July 16, 2004, allowing approximately 80 to 100 employees to transition to G4's main office in Los Angeles if they agreed to relocate there.[27] Shows from TechTV that were not redundant to G4's offerings continued on until July, when the closing of the TechTV Offices would close the respective stages for these shows in turn.\n\nOn May 10, 2004, G4 Media completed the acquisition of TechTV from Vulcan. G4techTV was launched in the U.S. on May 28, 2004. This led to the cancellation of many of the TechTV channels throughout carriers across the world (e.g.: systems with both channels active, systems limiting Comcast's number of channels on their lineup, etc.) On January 3, 2005, TechTV International began airing select programs from G4techTV. After the closure deadline passed on July 16, 2004, only Los Angeles produced shows would air on the new channel. The final production originating at TechTV in San Francisco was the September 2, 2004, episode of The Screen Savers (which was taped on July 16, 2004).\n\nOn February 15, 2005, the TechTV brand was dropped from the United States G4techTV feed, leaving the network name as G4 – Video Game Television which also echoed the changes in programming made to the channel due to the merger for both G4's original offering and the greatly diminished TechTV originated shows (exceptions noted below); after that, G4 went through a rebranding and changed most of its programming to position itself as a male-oriented network.\n\nTechTV shows and personalities who survived the merger\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Screen Savers survived somewhat in Attack of the Show!, remaining an open-format hosted talk show. On March 17, 2005, the staff made an announcement that they intended to reformat The Screen Savers to better fit the network, including the change of its name (a computer term for a program to protect a monitor from burned-in imagery, which no longer fit when The Screen Savers stopped covering computer self-help and DIY programming). It changed to Attack of the Show (a reference to the Star Wars prequel \"Attack of the Clones\"), and while still covering technology to a lesser extent, it also covers autos, sports, movies, new products and pop culture. Kevin Rose, Sarah Lane, and Brendan Moran stayed on after the transition to Attack of the Show for a short time, but Rose left on May 27, 2005, and both Lane and Moran left after their marriage on April 6, 2006, marking the final TechTV on-camera staff's exit from the program.\n\nSix TechTV personalities, Kevin Rose, Sarah Lane, Morgan Webb, Adam Sessler, Chi-Lan Lieu and Brendan Moran relocated to Los Angeles to join G4. Only two TechTV shows, Anime Unleashed and X-Play, survived the merger without any major changes. Anime Unleashed (and in turn, all of the anime series which aired on the block) was canceled in March 2006. X-Play was the last TechTV-created show in production under G4 until it was announced in late 2012 that it and Attack of the Show would both be cancelled in December 2012.\n\nIn April 2012, Sessler was let go from G4.[28][29] A proper reason was not given, however there have been rumors of a contractual dispute.[30] Sessler was the last of the original hosts from the initial launch of ZDTV in 1998. When the network withdrew all their live programming in December 2012, Blair Butler and Webb were the only remaining TechTV personalities working at G4.\n\nPrograms\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following is a partial list of programs aired by TechTV.\n\nOriginal programming\n\n[edit]\n\nAudioFile – a weekly program focusing on technology's increasing role in the music industry.[31]\n\nBig Thinkers – a weekly interactive program that conducts interviews with the technology industry's visionaries.[31][32][33][34]\n\nCall for Help – a prime-time interactive program in which viewers can call, email or netcam for assistance in solving computer problems.[31][32][33][34]\n\nComputer Shopper – a weekly program that provides information about computer hardware and software products and how to buy them intelligently.[32]\n\nCyberCrime – a weekly program that investigates dangers to computer users such as fraud, hacking, viruses, cybersex crimes, and invasions of privacy.[31][33][34][35]\n\nDigital Avenue – a prime-time program in which manufacturers present in-depth demonstrations of their latest products.[32]\n\nEye Drops – a weekly showcase of computer-animated shorts.[36]\n\nFresh Gear – a weekly program that reviews technological gadgets.[31][32][33][34]\n\nInternet Tonight – a prime-time program showcasing people and personalities who specialize in the Internet.[31][32][33]\n\nInvent This! – a weekly prime-time program showcasing inventors.[34]\n\nMicrosoft Insider Live – a pair of special live events that aired on October 5 and November 2, 2002.

      "# [Paul Allen's Historic Computers Under the Hammer by Sue Gee](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/82-heritage/17430-paul-allens-enigma-machine-under-the-hammer.html)\nDozens of rare historic computers are currently up for auction. As well as a room-sized PDP 7, there's an Altair, an Apple I, a Cray I and an Enigma machine on offer to the highest bidder as the private collection of the late Paul Allen, is sold by Christies, New York.\n\nAs well as being co-founder of Microsoft with Bill Gates, the duo responsible for bringing BASIC to the home computer, specifically the Altair 8800, Paul Allen was an avid collector. During his lifetime he had amassed not only historic computers and notable technology, but also artworks and precious artefacts of all kinds.\n\nAllen was also a philanthropist who supported the arts, music, sport, science and technology. After resigning from Microsoft in 1983, he set up Vulcan Inc. in 1986 as an investment and project management firm with his sister, Jody Allen and two years later established the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation to oversee his philanthropic venture. Now, nearly six years after his death in October 2018, from complications of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a disease he was first diagnosed with in 1982, items from his private collection are being sold to further his philanthropic mission.\n\nIn fact the number of items is so large, so varied and so valuable that Christies has split them across three sales. The collective title for the sales is \"Gen One: Innovations from the Paul G. Allen Collection\" and expectations are high given that in 2022 a previous auction titled \"Visionary: The Paul G. Allen Collection\" and comprising 155 art masterpieces achieved $1.62 billion, becoming the most valuable private collection ever to come to auction. The artworks now going on sale are in one of the two online auctions that started on August 23rd and finishes on September 12th. As it's title, \"Over the Horizon: Art of the Future from the Paul G. Allen Collection\" suggest, works in the 57 lots are devoted to how the future, especially interplanetary travel, was imagined by artists and other thinkers during the 20th century including Chesley Bonestell, Robert McCall, R.C. Swanson, George Gibbs, and Fred Freeman. According to Christies:\n\nThe artworks in this auction, along with their publication in popular magazines, inspired a generation of explorers, scientists, and aerospace engineers.\n\nThe concurrent online auction is Firsts: The History of Computing from the Paul G. Allen Collection which Christies claim:\n\npresents important milestones in the history of computing, some of which have been preserved in working order\n\nThe 58 lots in this sale comprises the bulk of the contents of the Living Computers, the Seattle-based museum, which Paul Allen founded in 2012 to display his growing collection of historic computers and have them restored to working order and maintained by a team of engineers. In this video posted by Christies, Stephen Jones, Senior Restoration & Collection Manager, Living Computers sets the scene and introduces some of the historic computers that he used to be responsible for, presenting a timeline that highlights the breakthroughs in technology that the machines represent.\n\nAs reported in Paul Allen's Living Computer Museum Going, Going, Gone Living Computers had been forced to close to the public by the pandemic 2020. It never re-opened much to the disappointment of those who appreciated Paul Allen's aim of preserving vintage and heritage computers for posterity. One aficionado, Seattle-area tech veteran, Paolo Tosolini, founder of Tosolini Productions, had done a high-tech 3D photo scans of Living Computers and later created a more detailed scan of the first and second floors. Now, using technology from the 3D-capture platform Matterport, interactive “hot spots” have been added to 16 items that are up for auction, including the PDP 7 and the Apple 1 with links to lot details at Chrisitie's.\n\nClick on image to go to the Virtual Tour of LCM and see how Paul Allen's collection told the history of computing.\n\nWhile the online auction a mix of huge and small items, from the PDP 7 to mercury delay line memory from the Remington Rand Univac, the gems of the LMC collection are included in the \"live auction, \"Pushing Boundaries: Ingenuity from the Paul G. Allen Collection, taking place at Christies Rockefeller Center galleries in New York on September with viewing open from September 6-9. It comprises 36 lots, including Einstein’s letter to President Roosevelt which propelled the US into the nuclear age and crucial artifacts from the Space Race, including astronaut Ed White’s spacesuit cover layer, the pilot’s in-flight logbook from Apollo 8, and an annotated checklist from the first American spacewalk in June 1965.\n\nThe historic computers included in the sale all have important stories. The MITS Altair 8800 is as Christie's state:\n\nThe first commercially successful personal computer, which catalysed the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s.\n\nMore importantly for Paul Allen it was the machine for which he and Bill Gates, when they were 22 and 20 years old respectively, created a BASIC interpreter, to know more about this and how it led to the formation of Microsoft, see articles in our History section.\n\nWhile Apple Is are rare, the one included in the sale, with an estimate of $500,000-800,00 is unique. Around 200 units were originally produced and one of these was retained by the company probably to be used a as demo unit. As explained in the lot details this machine was removed from its place in Jobs’ office in 1985 by Don Hutmacher after Steve Jobs was dismissed from Apple and engineers were allowed to take items from his office. Hutchmacher's Apple security pass is included in the lot.\n\nBy way of Apple I memorabilia, the auction also includes a lot comprising two typed letters, the first of which dated 5 November 1976, is signed twice by Steve Jobs and has apologetic annotation in his handwriting. Its estimate is $50,000–80,000.\n\nThere's also an Enigma Machine. We've covered the auction of several of these over the years, seeing them realize from $100,000 upwards. This one is a four-rotor model, manufactured by Heimsoeth & Rinke in 1941 and has an estimate of $250,000-350,000.\n\nAnother lot that caught my eye is an IBM 360/91 console, which according to Chrisitie's:\n\nstands as a testament to the advanced technology of its era, representing the height of the System/360 line and offering a rare glimpse into the computing innovations of the 1960s.\n\nHaving been owned by Princeton University and exhibited by Walt Disney Picture in Tomorrowland in 2015, this example was restored at Living Computers. Having had new circuitry added, the console:\n\nnow includes an animated display demonstrating its operation, complete with a playful light show currently programmed where Pac-Man chases a ghost, adding a touch of modern whimsy to its historical significance.\n\nMoving forward a decade there is a Cray-1 Supercomputer. Only around 80 units were ever built and this one, Serial Number 12 was purchased in 1981 by the University of Minnesota and was designed to match UMN colors. After being decommissioned it was used as a sales model for Cray Research Inc. Only 17 Cray-1s are thought to survive and this is the first to come to auction with an estimate of USD 150,000 – USD 250,000.\n\nThere's a decommissioned Cray-2 in the online auction with an estimate of USD 150,000 – USD 250,000, but as yet no bid has yet been placed. One does have to wonder who has deep enough pockets and sufficient spare room to afford to win such an item. Although the computers are indeed important milestones in the history of computing they can also be seen as white elephants - expensive to maintain and a big responsibility due to their rarity.\n\nAs Stephen Jones points out in the video Living Computers was:\n\n\"a grand collection of restored machines, some of the most important milestones in the history of computing\"\n\nwhich Paul Allen had put together to inspire the next generation of technologists. Even though all the proceeds of the sales are destined for charitable causes, the idea that this collection is being dispersed, with much of it disappearing from public view, comes as a great disappointment to people, including those who had donated their computers to preserve them for posterity and to make them accessible to future generations.\n\nMore Information\n\nGen One: Innovations from the Paul G.

      "# [How Big Box Stores Can Win with Baling on 2024-05-02](https://www.vulcanwire.com/big-box-stores-baling/)\nBig box retailers move incredible amounts of merchandise, which translates to a mountain of cardboard and packaging waste. Baling offers a smart solution to transform that waste into manageable volumes, reducing hauling costs and even generating a little extra income. Here’s where many big box stores can gain a big edge in their efficiency…\n\nStart With Quality Baling Wire from Vulcan Wire\n\nBaling wire is the backbone of efficient big box store recycling operations. Key features of quality baling wire include strength and durability. The wire should be able to withstand the high-compression forces exerted by the baler, preventing breaks and the need for retying. Also, choosing the appropriate gauge of wire is essential for maximum baling efficiency and prevents frustrating delays and wasted wire. Plus, different applications may require different types of wire, such as black annealed, high-tensile galvanized steel, single-loop bale ties, or box wire.\n\nInferior wire can result in annoying breaks, loose bales, and even equipment damage. Don’t settle for anything less than top-notch wire that can withstand the demands of large-scale operations.\n\nMaintenance Isn’t Optional\n\nTreat your baler like a high-performance machine – it needs regular maintenance to keep cranking out those dense, valuable bales. A neglected baler is a recipe for frustrating breakdowns, lost time, and grumpy employees.\n\nHere’s how to stay ahead of potential problems:\n\nTrain Your Team: Even the best baler and wire won’t help if it’s used incorrectly. Invest in basic maintenance training for your employees so they can confidently do simple upkeep and spot issues before they become major headaches.\n\nSchedule Proactive Service: Don’t wait until something breaks! Partner with a maintenance provider (like Vulcan Wire) for scheduled inspections and tune-ups. It’s like an insurance policy for your baling operation.\n\nThink Like a Mechanic: Picture those moving parts – the wires, the gears, the powerful ram. Regular lubrication and cleaning those areas are essential to prevent wear and tear that could lead to costly repairs.\n\nDon’t Let a Broken Tie Device Derail Your Baling\n\nYour baler tie device is the heart of a smooth baling operation. A malfunctioning tie device throws a major wrench in the works. Without a properly functioning tie device, your bales might become loose and messy, making it a nightmare to handle and transport. A broken tie device also means your team is probably hand-tying bales, which is slow, inefficient, and frustrating. All these delays mean higher labor costs and less time for other crucial tasks in your big box store.\n\nWinning with Baling\n\nSome more ways big box stores can get more out of baling is by concentrating on bale density. Denser bales mean fewer hauling trips and less wasted space. Quality wire is key here, ensuring your bales hold their shape even at maximum capacity. Stores can also separate higher-value recyclables and types of cardboard to maximize your profit from the operation.\n\nChoosing the Right Partner\n\nChoosing the right baling wire, parts supplier, and service provider is just as crucial as choosing the right baler. You need a company that understands the unique challenges of big box retail, and Vulcan Wire can help. We’ve got your back on baling wire, baler tie device parts, and servicing. With over 40 years of experience, we’re baling experts.\n\nHere’s why Vulcan Wire is the clear choice:\n\nAmerican-Made Quality: Our wire is manufactured right here in the USA, ensuring top-tier quality and reliability.\n\nMassive Inventory, Fast Shipping: Need baling wire or a tie device part yesterday? Our extensive inventory and network of warehouses ensure you get what you need, fast.\n\nReal-World Expertise: We’ve been serving big box stores, recyclers, and more for decades. We know what it takes to keep your operation running smoothly.",

      "# [Announcing the 2023 Gregoire Fellows](https://www.law.uw.edu/news-events/news/2023/gregoire-fellows)\nEight UW Law students are named Gregoire Fellows as part of a continuing partnership between law schools and the Washington legal community to increase professional diversity.\n\nThe University of Washington School of Law is proud to announce its 2023–2024 Gregoire Fellows: Lauren Chivers, Julia Ely, Esha Jain, Jason Lu, Tavis McClain, Gary Nguyen, Francisco Quintana and Kyler Teo.\n\nSince 2015, the Gregoire Fellows Program has attracted diverse and talented students to UW Law and connected them with leading Puget Sound area businesses, governmental organizations and law firms committed to increasing diversity in the legal profession. In 2019, the program expanded to include the Seattle University School of Law.\n\nThe program is a unique partnership between the law schools and the legal community in Washington to ensure the legal profession reflects the diversity of our society.\n\nAs part of the program, students receive paid summer internships, which split their summer work assignments between two placements at a participating law firm, a corporate legal department and a governmental entity after the first year of law school. Students also receive scholarship aid and financial assistance for bar exam preparation. Additionally, the fellows participate in a mentorship program with former Washington Governor Christine Gregoire.\n\nThe Gregoire Fellows Program is made possible thanks to generous support from sponsors, including Amazon; Davis Wright Tremaine; Expedia Group; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center; K&L Gates LLP; Keller Rohrback LLP; King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office; Lane Powell PC; Moss Adams LLP; Microsoft Corp.; Nintendo of America Inc., Ogden Murphy Wallace PLLC, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP; Pacifica Law Group; Perkins Coie LLP; Reed Longyear PLLC; Ryan Swanson PLLC; Seagen Inc.; Starbucks Corp.; Stoel Rives LLP; Stokes Lawrence PS; Vulcan Inc.; Washington State Office of the Attorney General; and Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nLauren Chivers\n\nBachelor of Arts in Philosophy and Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Sustainability, Pepperdine University\n\nLauren focused her undergraduate studies on the systematic inequalities of climate change. As a leader in Pepperdine University’s sustainability coalitions and a part of the second inaugural class to receive a bachelor’s degree in environmental sustainability, Lauren looks forward to tackling topics involving the intersection of technology and environmental issues while at UW Law. Additionally, Lauren spent time serving as a judicial intern for the Superior Court of Santa Clara County, working on research pertaining to child dependency and juvenile justice in her native Bay Area. Through her time in this role, Lauren developed a deeper interest in the process of judicial decision-making and witnessed firsthand how judicial proceedings and fierce advocacy shape the lives of those in her community.\n\n“I am honored to have the support of this fellowship as I launch my legal career. Through building connections within the Seattle legal industry, I hope to use this opportunity to reflect on how I may leverage my values and skills to serve the communities most affected by social inequality,” says Lauren. “As a first-generation student, the Gregoire Fellowship will provide the first steps toward my commitment to uplifting others seeking to enter this field. I am grateful to be part of a program that will foster my confidence, ambition and leadership skills as an emerging legal professional.”\n\nJulia Ely\n\nBachelor of Arts in Political Science, Sociology minor, American University\n\nDuring her undergraduate studies, Julia interned for the Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women where she worked on several projects aimed at strengthening services to victims of domestic violence. She then worked for Holland & Knight’s Public Policy and Regulation Group, where she assisted with policy in areas such as Indigenous affairs, agriculture and COVID-19 resources. After graduation, Julia spent three years working in local government with the Pitkin County, Colorado Board of County Commissioners. These experiences allowed her to examine how our communities are affected by legal and governmental intervention, highlighting her passion for advocacy and inclusive leadership.\n\n“As a Gregoire Fellow, I am eager to build upon my experiences and work on combating some of the most pressing legal issues of our time, such as fair housing, sustainable growth and development, and economic justice,” says Julia. “The opportunities afforded by this program provide the resources to flourish as an attorney and promote diverse perspectives in the legal field. I am honored to have the support of the Gregoire Fellows Program as I begin law school and work towards starting my legal career.”\n\nEsha Jain\n\nBachelor of Arts in English, Philosophy and Political Science, University of Washington\n\nEsha is a consultant for a local small business, where she researches codified laws and analyzes their impact on an ongoing land use dispute, mentors new personnel and furthers their writing abilities, and maintains all written communication, including regular correspondence with government agencies, on behalf of the client. In this role, Esha also created an exhibit list and helped draft a closing argument for a quasi-judicial proceeding. Esha is also on the board of a homeowners’ association, where she resolves various tenant and member concerns and collaborates with board members to ensure compliance with governing legal documents.\n\n\"My experiences have taught me how to interact effectively with a wide array of people. I know that this particular ability will transfer well to my legal career, allowing me to better serve my future clients,” says Esha. “I wholeheartedly support the work that the Gregoire Fellows Program is doing to increase and broaden diversity in Seattle’s legal industry. I am also very grateful for the opportunities that the Gregoire Fellows Program will provide to me, and I look forward to effecting positive change.\"\n\nJason Lu\n\nBachelor of Arts in Mathematics and Russian Language and Literature, Davidson College\n\nDuring his undergraduate studies, Jason studied abroad in Russia, where he conducted research on the memorialization of eyewitness history through poetry and prose from the Siege of Leningrad. While there, he also interned with integration centers which assisted in the transitioning of refugee children into everyday life. Jason also interned with the International Rescue Committee as an immigration intern, helping U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) applicants with translation and interpreting forms and documents.\n\n“I’m honored to be named a Gregoire Fellow, and also very grateful for all of the professional development and mentorship that the fellowship’s programming will provide,” says Jason. “In return, I intend to use the network and skills acquired through the Gregoire Fellowship to provide legal counsel to communities that have been historically underrepresented and disenfranchised, and to continue to serve the various immigrant and refugee communities, much like the one I’m from.”\n\nTavis McClain\n\nBachelor of Arts in Law, Societies and Justice and Business minor, University of Washington\n\nTavis's undergraduate studies focused on how differently the law operates on the books and on the ground. He also received an introduction to various elements of business. Following graduation, he worked at a downtown Seattle law firm where he conducted legal research and assisted in various intake roles. This experience, along with his undergraduate studies, piqued his interest in the legal field.\n\n\"As an aspiring lawyer and as a Gregoire Fellow, I look forward to taking full advantage of the opportunities that are presented to me and learning from both my peers and mentors,” Tavis said. \"I believe that my diverse experiences and background, combined with the unique opportunities provided to me as a fellowship recipient, will allow me to push forward and advance in the legal field and contribute towards equality and fairness in the legal profession.\"\n\nGary Nguyen\n\nBachelor of Arts in Business Administration (Accounting), University of Washington\n\nInspired by lived experiences, Gary pursued accounting in his undergraduate career to help bridge the gap between the financial world and underrepresented communities. His role as an associate at PricewaterhouseCoopers was one of many experiences that required him to interact with ever-changing tax laws and their subsequent impact on others. To delve into the effects of the law even further, Gary is eager to shift into a legal career while continually uplifting his passion for mentorship and education.\n\n“Throughout my life, I have seen firsthand how mentorship, or the lack thereof, has the power to change lives. As a Gregoire Fellow, I hope to use the invaluable resources provided to me to bring mentorship into the legal field and encourage legal literacy amongst my peers, communities and future clients,” says Gary. “Where accounting is formulaic, the law is fluid and has no limits on how you can help others, so I am confident that this will bring about increased perspectives and creative legal solutions.”\n\nFrancisco Quintana\n\nBachelor of Arts in International Relations, emphasis on Peace and Security Studies, and minor in Human Rights Studies, University of California at Davis\n\nFrancisco's undergraduate work focused on the history and development of war and conflict in the Mediterranean region. His honors thesis delved into the mechanisms of genocide denial, exploring its effects through a humanitarian lens. Upon graduation, Francisco pursued a career in political communications, last serving as the Communications Director for California’s 52nd Assembly District, affording him the opportunity to direct the Assembly’s outreach platform for the North and East Los Angeles regions.\n\n“My time in the public sector helped me identify the regulatory aspects of cybersecurity and technology that most fascinate me, which I believe can change the trajectory of future generations,” says Francisco. “The Gregoire Fellows Program, in providing firsthand exposure and access to Seattle's most prestigious legal spaces, has afforded me the opportunity to capitalize on the primary driver of my motivation to pursue a legal career, which is to become an effective advocate for people and for important causes.”\n\nKyler Teo\n\nBachelor of Arts in Political Economy, University of Washington\n\nKyler began his undergraduate studies in chemistry but pivoted to exploring the intersection between politics and economics. He worked as a writer for Sporcle throughout his studies, covering topics anywhere between “how many holes does a straw have” to human rights violations. After graduating, he returned to coach the undergraduate mock trial program at UW, where he works to uplift speakers from marginalized communities.\n\n“Intersectionality has always been core to my identity and exploring it has similarly always been something I value deeply. Examining that, I think, is key to taking responsibility for inclusion in the legal profession,” says Kyler. “To be accepted as a Gregoire Fellow is a great honor, and I hope the opportunities afforded to me will promote a more equitable and diverse community, one that strives to be better than the one it was yesterday.”",

Koniar then won three terms as Foley’s mayor before retiring in 2020.\n\nAccording to the city, Koniar oversaw a period of rapid growth and development, as the city’s population and budget soared, thanks to its proximity to Alabama’s Gulf Coast beaches.\n\nFoley was one of Alabama’s fastest-growing cities during that time, including expansion of county roads, the city’s emergence as a sports tournament host venue, and the development of the OWA Parks and Resort, a theme park, water park, and entertainment venue in the city.\n\nAccording to his obituary, Koniar is survived by his wife Linda Sue (Lee), sons John Todd Koniar (Kim) of Magnolia Springs, Robert Thomas Koniar (Sarah) of Lewisville, Texas, daughter Mell Koniar Davis of Foley; five grandchildren, Katherine Ann Koniar, John Bradley Koniar, Claire Ann Davis, Shelby Chatham Koniar, Lee Webster Davis; sister, Sandy Chatham Martin (Ken) of Cato, MS; and many nieces and nephews.\n\nKoniar served four years in the United States Air Force, being honorably discharged as a captain in 1969, and worked for Vulcan, Inc. in Foley for 37 years.\n\nKoniar’s visitation will be Thursday, March 28 at First Presbyterian Church of Foley from 1-3 p.m. with the funeral service to follow.",
      "# [Amazon Employees Begin Relocating from Seattle Office Space to Bellevue by Kara on 2023-10-10](https://downtownbellevue.com/2023/10/10/amazon-employees-begin-relocating-from-seattle-office-space-bellevue/)\nAmazon is moving 2,000 office employees from Seattle to Bellevue into two office towers. Costar News, a commercial real estate website, first reported the news.\n\nVulcan Real Estate’s 555 Tower is one of the two office buildings where Amazon employees will be moving into this fall. The first 19 floors out of the 42-story tower have been completed. Work on the interior of the remaining floors remains paused.\n\nThe other building that 1,000 Amazon employees are planned to move into is West Main Tower 1 in coming months.\n\nIn July 2022, Amazon announced that they had made a decision to pause construction on Bellevue 600’s second tower, while the exterior shell and core work for Tower 1 at Bellevue 600, 555 Tower, Towers 2 and 3 of West Main, and The Artise will be completed.\n\nAmazon’s previous decision to pause construction does not affect hiring. According to the tech company, they are still fulfilling their pledge to have 25,000 employees in Bellevue.\n\nJohn Schoettler, Amazon’s vice president of global real estate and facilities, stated, “Our offices are long-term investments and we want to make sure that we design them in a way that meets our employees’ needs in the future. As we continue to learn, we’re pausing construction to reevaluate the design of some of our projects in Bellevue. This doesn’t affect our plans to bring more than 25,000 jobs to the city, or our commitment to continuing to invest in and engage with the community.” In July 2022, Amazon had almost 10,000 employees, with 2,000 open roles in Bellevue.\n\nBroderick Group’s newly released third-quarter report discussed that the first Bellevue 600 tower, and the Artise, which is leased by Amazon, are expected to be completed in 2024.\n\nThe report also highlighted a growing trend: in-person office usage is on the rise. Hybrid work models are becoming the norm, with companies realizing that being in the office can boost productivity, collaboration, and cost-effectiveness. Amazon, for instance, now requires three days of in-person work, while Meta in The Spring District is following suit. The return-to-office mandate have has driven foot traffic and increased office use significantly, which could also boost the real estate market."
