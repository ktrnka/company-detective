VRE uses cookies to administer and operate the Site, including site configuration and IT security. VRE also uses cookies with Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager (referred together as “Google Web Tools“) for feedback and usage statistics to operate and improve the Site.

For more information about how Google Analytics uses cookies, please review the Google Analytics Cookie Guide.\n\nTags: We use third-party JavaScript tags (code elements), to set the Performance Cookies. We manage the tags using Google Tag Manager, which is a tag management tool that integrates with Google Analytics to derive usage statistics and performance analytics.\n\nIn order to provide the Site, VRE may use and share Aggregate Data collected through the cookies with third parties. For example, Google Web Tools interact with other Google Inc. products and services in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy. Please see the section below on “Managing Your Information” for ways to manage how your information is shared via Google Web Tools.\n\nHow Your Information is Used\n\nPlease see below on the circumstances where VRE may share your personal information with others without further notice, obligation or liability to you:\n\nService Providers: VRE may use third-party providers to provide or support some of the services that are available through the Site, including without limitation, communications and hosting services, network security, technical and user support, tracking and reporting, quality assurance testing, and other functions. VRE may share your information with these third-party providers so that they can perform their services or complete your requests. These third-party providers may share information with VRE that they obtain from or about you in connection with providing their services or completing your requests. Third-party providers may also share this information with their subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control.\n\nBusiness Transfers: VRE may share your information with its affiliated entities, prospective buyers, partners or joint ventures, in which case VRE will require them to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires VRE or all or substantially all of its assets (e.g. merger, acquisition or sale), that company will possess the same information, and will assume the rights and obligations with respect to that information as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nInvestigations: VRE may investigate and disclose your personal information if it has a good faith belief that such disclosure (a) is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on VRE; (b) is helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible fraud wrongdoing in connection with the Site; (c) is necessary to act under exigent circumstances to protect the safety of the public or users of the Site, or (d) is reasonably necessary to protect VRE’s rights, reputation, property, or that of its users, affiliates, partners or the public.\n\nLinks: The Site may contain links to unaffiliated third-party services. If you visit any websites through those links, the collection and use of your information will be subject to such third party’s terms and privacy policy. Unless there is a separate basis for sharing your information as expressly set forth in this Privacy Policy, VRE will not share your personal information with these third parties and is not responsible for their privacy practices. VRE will not be liable for any loss or damage that may be incurred as a result of accessing or using any third-party links through the Site.\n\nManaging Your Information\n\nCookie Settings\n\nYou may manage your cookies at any time through the cookie settings on the Site. Please note that if you change your settings to opt out of receiving cookies, it will not retroactively delete or remove any previously collected information, but it will prevent your information from being shared through such cookies from that point on.\n\nWithin the US: If the Site detects that your IP address is from a location within the United States, you will be prompted to accept or reject cookies when you first visit the platform. If you accept, you accept all of the cookies specified in the “Cookies” section above. If you take no action, you will be deemed as having accepted the cookies. If you opt out, you will be directed to a settings page where you can select which cookies to opt out of receiving. You cannot, however, opt out of Strictly Necessary Cookies, but you can configure your browser settings to block or alert you about them. If you block Strictly Necessary Cookies, some parts of the Site will have degraded performance or will not work. You can turn off cookies in your browser settings at any time, and delete previously saved cookies and other browsing data by clearing your browsing data and history.\n\nOutside of the US: If the Site detects that your IP address is from a location outside of the United States, all of the same apply as above, except if you take no action to accept or reject cookies, you will be deemed as having rejected the cookies.\n\nGoogle Web Tools\n\nYou can manage how your information is shared and used with Google Web Tools as follows:\n\nGoogle Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on: Google has developed a browser add-on tool to enable visitors of websites with Google cookies and tags to prevent Google Analytics from receiving their information. This add-on will not prevent websites from collecting information through other first party or third-party cookies and tags. You can download and install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to begin using this tool.\n\nGoogle Settings: In addition to above, you can manage how Google uses the information obtained through Google Web Tools and other cookies, and how it interacts with other Google products by changing the settings in your Google account. For example, you can restrict personalization features used in Google ads by changing your preference settings in your Google account to prevent use for targeted ads and content. Please review Google’s Privacy Controls for more general information on how you can configure various privacy and share settings through Google.\n\nThird-Party Tools: Third parties have also developed mechanisms for opting out of various cookies that use and share information collected from Google Web Tools and other sources for advertising purposes. For US-based users, the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) WebChoices is a tool that enables you to view and manage the cookies used for online advertising. For EU-based users, there is Your Online Choices.\n\nCompliance\n\nInformation collected from the Site will be stored and processed in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States and visit the Site, you permit us to transfer your information outside of your country.\n\nSecurity\n\nVRE is committed to protecting the security of your information and follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information it receives. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, devices, or cloud or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while VRE strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, VRE cannot guarantee its absolute security.\n\nPersonal Information of Children\n\nThe Site is intended for a general audience, and VRE does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you become aware that a child has provided VRE with personal information without parental consent, please contact VRE at [email protected]. If VRE becomes aware that a child under 16 has provided personal information without parental consent, VRE will take steps to delete such data as soon as possible without notice.\n\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\n\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) effective as of January 1, 2020 is a law that protects the privacy rights of California residents by putting certain requirements on how businesses collect and use personal information. VRE is committed to take the necessary measures to protect your personal information and comply with the CCPA as the specific requirements and application of the rules continue to develop over time. As part of this commitment, the cookie settings are available for you to change your settings any time.\n\nEuropean Union (EU) Residents: Your Privacy Rights Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n\nIf you are located in the EU, we will collect personal information only if VRE has one or more legal bases for doing so under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The legal bases depend on your interaction with the Site. VRE will only collect personal information from you where: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; (ii) it is necessary to perform a contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you; (iii) it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests; (iv) it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or another natural person; or (v) it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.\n\nData Subject Rights\n\nYou can submit a request regarding your personal information through the Data Subject Access Request Form.

      "# [Vulcan Tech Dev Blog — From Logbooks to Web Consoles: The Tech Behind DAS by vulcantech on 2016-12-22](https://techblog.vulcan.com/post/154821633396/from-logbooks-to-web-consoles-the-tech-behind-das)\nOn the Philanthropic Technology team at Vulcan, we collaborate with other organizations to identify and solve some of the big problems facing our world. One major initiative we’ve focused on recently is the Domain Awareness Project, also known as DAS, where we are collaborating with conservationists in Africa to protect elephants. DAS complements another of our key initiatives to safeguard this species, described in a previous tech blog: Technology for the Great Elephant Census.\n\nAll of the conservation area teams we talked to are using logbooks to record incidents and animal movements. These logbooks are used both as a reference and to compile monthly reports. Those monthly reports are then compiled into annual reports developed to inform the boards of these conservation areas about what occurred over the year. Typically, all of this information was then placed on a physical shelf to collect dust.\n\nCommunications from rangers in the field went into similar logbooks. Some organizations augmented these paper systems with rudimentary database systems written in MS Access or built in complex spreadsheets. We all agreed there was a nee to consolidate and make this information more easily accessible to their entire organizations in near real-time.\n\nSave the Elephants, or STE, is a research and conservation organization based in Kenya. STE pioneered the use of elephant collars to record and analyze elephant movements. We have been collaborating with STE on other projects and were familiar with their tracking platform. Through discussions with them and others, their tracking platform became the genesis for DAS. Working with STE, we have incorporated their animal-tracking expertise with new functionality to record the data streams typically found in conservation areas. This project culminated in the DAS platform, which provides conservation area managers with a tool to visualize and monitor their animals, rangers, and related incidents.\n\nIn our first minimal viable product, or MVP, of DAS, we first collected animal-collar tracking information and displayed it on a website. Next, we added security so users were limited to which animals they could access and how much of the tracking they could view. We have also worked with several handheld radio platform makers that rangers carry in the field. With the integration of ranger radios, it allows the conservation area managers to contact them and coordinate ranger movements.\n\nOn the same map we use to visualize animal and ranger movements, we also show reports of incidents. The radio operator receives calls about incidents and enters these reports directly in DAS. These are communications of status or occurrences sent in from the field. In the military, the base report is known as a situational report or sitrep. Our technology allows the radio operator to enter these sitreps directly into DAS which in most cases includes a location for visualization on the map.\n\nAbove is an example image of the DAS web console. (Note: This is an example conservation area, not a real place.) On the left is the big map showing the location of the elephants and their tracks. On the right is the list of incoming reports. Not shown is the map layers tab that allows the user to see or hide different user interface elements, such as the reports, animals, rangers, or geographic points of interest.\n\nIn addition to the sitreps, there was other data we needed to incorporate, such as human wildlife conflict, or HWC, reports. A HWC report records a ranger in contact with a person of concern. Additionally, a vehicle report describes a vehicle of interest, such as car or truck that is not supposed to be in the conservation area.\n\nBased on these different report types, we investigated several ideas, including having many tables in the database or one wide table with many empty fields. We looked at entity-attribute-value – EAV – pairs. Using EAV works in some cases, but the downside for us was the extra work to query the data. We needed to address custom report data storage while also considering how the user interface (UI) would render it. We discovered an open standard called JSON Schema that looked interesting, and there was a validation implementation available in Python. We also found an Angular Forms implementation for rendering the user interface. We chose PostgreSQL, which includes JSON support at the field level. Using JSON Schema to define the custom report data, then rendering it using existing libraries allowed us to quickly support custom reports for our initial sites.\n\nDAS is built on the Django Web Framework and is written in Python. We use PostgreSQL and PostGIS for storing and accessing data. Various open source-based GIS libraries, including GDAL, PyProj, Shapely and Fiona, are used to analyze movement data. Django Rest Framework provides our restful API. Additionally, we have used a SocketIO library to support real-time updates to our single web page app. Our visualization consists of a single page Angular web app, specifically using MapBox and Leaflet technology for the map render piece. Redis rounds out our infrastructure to provide queuing and real-time communication coordination.\n\nDuring development, we used AWS RDS and ElasticCache to host our PostgreSQL and Redis services respectively. ElasticBeanstalk provides an easy to configure almost all-in-one pipeline. For production, we need to have the ability to deploy on-premise as well as in the cloud and have moved to using Chef to coordinate this type of deployment.\n\nWe have DAS installed at two conservation areas so far with plans for another to go live in January 2017."

      "# Post ID 1apmpn4: sad that living computers: museum + labs is still closed but feeling a bit of hope! with +87 score by [(skyscapeparadise, Reddit, 2024-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1apmpn4/sad_that_living_computers_museum_labs_is_still/)\nWhen the Living Computers museum closed during the pandemic, several other Vale Group (formerly Vulcan Inc.) museums/public spaces closed as well including the Cinerama and the Flying Heritage Collection. It seemed as though none of these spaces would ever be open to the public again as the priorities of Vale Group appeared to be shifting away from these projects. However, given that both the Cinerama and the Flying Heritage Collection have been sold off to new owners who have reopened them, I'm hoping that Living Computers can meet this positive fate as well. I never had the opportunity to visit LCM+L since I had only recently moved to Washington at the time. Most people don't care about old computers but being someone who is really interested in history and technology, the thought of being able to try out a Xerox Alto or a PDP-11 or an Apple I seems incredible! It makes me sad that this one-of-a-kind resource has been in limbo, but my hope is that Vale is in the process of selling the museum to an owner who will give it the care and attention it deserves. I haven't given up the dream of being able to visit this museum!\n\n## Comment ID kq7dj58 with +24 score by [(aerothorn, Reddit, 2024-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1apmpn4/sad_that_living_computers_museum_labs_is_still/kq7dj58/) (in reply to ID 1apmpn4):\nIt's a fantastic museum, I am not holding my breath on it reopening but I hope with you.

I was told that Jody walked around the building basically harassing people.\n\nAlso, I was peripherally connected to a person who was one air crew of Paul Allen's planes and he said that Jody Allen's kids were all a bunch of entitled brats.  He said Paul was okay, but that most of the rest were really entitled.  \n\nMaybe her name should be Karen?\n\n### Comment ID if0zdsy with +6 score by [(dukeofmadnessmotors, Reddit, 2022-07-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/vs5fqn/why_do_people_dislike_jody_allen_so_much/if0zdsy/) (in reply to ID iezkuki):\nI worked with a company owned by Paul Allen and interacted with him and Bert Kolde.

I think she's done a poor job of handling the Seahawks as well. People like to say that Paul Allen deferred to the experts, but he wasn't afraid to rock the boat. For example, Mike Holmgren was given HC and GM roles when he came here. He had his GM powers revoked after poor drafts. Or how about Paul Allen canning Mora after just one season? \n\nI think if Paul Allen was running the show I do think things would look differently.\n\n## Comment ID if00rmh with +2 score by [(SPEK2120, Reddit, 2022-07-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/vs5fqn/why_do_people_dislike_jody_allen_so_much/if00rmh/) (in reply to ID vs5fqn):\nI feel like part of it's because no one who was put in charge of Paul's passion projects seem to give a shit about them/would rather have them gone and she's the easiest one to take it out on.

He wasn’t a football guy (more of a basketball fan) but he bought the Seahawks so they wouldn’t leave Seattle. He bought and kept open a lotta local little historical places like a computer museum and the cinerama. He also had a very hands on approach to the Seahawks where the community trusted his leadership. He definitely had points of conflict with the community, people either loved or hated his Seattle Commons idea to build a Central Park using the cities money but his land (people thought he should fund it himself and pointed out he was developing all the surrounding land) and his rich neighbors got annoyed the way he treated Lake Washington as his own personal pond (tho the stories are just funny to everyone else). However, ultimately Paul’s behavior made him someone people looked up to and that’s not the same for Jody. She’s been shutting down his program and has shown disinterest in properties like the Seahawks. For the Seahawks specifically given the timing she’s an easy person to blame\n\n## Comment ID ifh898g with +1 score by [(snokesroomate, Reddit, 2022-07-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/vs5fqn/why_do_people_dislike_jody_allen_so_much/ifh898g/) (in reply to ID vs5fqn):\nI like her.

I abhor any Chiefs fan that dons a Tyreek jersey because he hit a pregnant woman…and that organization still allows him to suit up and play in front of tens of thousands cheering fans all because he can run fast? Cool. So as long as your are productive than, you can hit whomever you want if you are a Chief. But that’s not fair to the whole fan base because I’m sure there are a ton of people (going out on a limb here for humanity sake) who don’t support Tyreek for being able to play too. \n\nAre KC fans wrong for cheering their team on or it is possible, just maybe, to like the team as a whole and simultaneously despise individuals? Are Patriot fans not allowed to cheer on their team because Kraft got a handy in a massage parlor?

I don’t want him on my team because my fandom is a personal investment of time and money into the product on the field. I don’t really care about the teams ownership group. I don’t think about them. I do think about the players. I root for them to do well. I suffer their failures. I like to discuss them. I don’t want to do that for deshaun Watson. \n\nIf I was making a moral stance I wouldn’t watch the NFL. it’s way too problematic of a league. But that’s not my issue with Watson. My issue with Watson is I find what he’s done to be too far for me to ignore and I don’t want to invest the personal effort of my fandom towards him directly. I’m not taking a stand, I just don’t have the motivation to be a fan of a piece of Shit of his caliber and would rather spend that energy doing something else.

This week will mark the Lakers 8th during that same timespan (1987, 1988, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009, 2010, 2020)\n\n* As Laker fans like to point out, only 4 of our NBA championships took place after the NBA/ABA merger in 1976. This will be the Lakers 11th.  Bulls (6 titles) and Spurs (5 titles) also lead us in post-merger championships.\n\n* The bulk of our championships (57, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66) happened when the league was 8-9 teams deep.  \n\n* Magic (5 titles) vs Bird (3 titles) was a victory for the Lakers.\n\n* Even our 1 championship in 2008 was eventually vanquished by the Lakers when they won back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010... essentially turning KG and the 08 Celtics into a Joe Frazier-esque footnote to Kobe's Muhammad Ali-esque championship legacy.\n\n* Lakers = 33 Finals appearances to Boston's 21\n\nIt sucks, but it is what it is.  The Lakers are the NBA's greatest franchise.  Must be nice to be in Los Angeles.  \n\nGotta hope that Tatum and his team can build a little dynasty here and start chipping away at the Laker league dominance.   It's been 12 years since our last championship.  Unclear if/when we'll be see ourselves back on top.\n\n## Comment ID g81hhm2 with +47 score by [(chickspeak, Reddit, 2020-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g81hhm2/) (in reply to ID j6y7pj):\nWe have the same number of championships with Dallas, Cleveland, Toronto, Detroit in the last 30 years. Into the player empowerment era, the non-mega-city teams have to do everything perfectly to be a real contender and need perfect luck to win a championship while the mega-city teams can just hoard the superstars who want to team up through free agency to become a contender.\n\n### Comment ID g81jg0g with +15 score by [(yardplayfaction, Reddit, 2020-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g81jg0g/) (in reply to ID g81hhm2):\nThe Celtics have signed as FAs recently: Kemba, Hayward, and Horford, 3 all stars.

Unless we draft another Pierce type of player (hoping JT is a Celtic lifer) and build a competent squad with assets and using those assets to trade for a superstar, its hard to see how teams like Boston with no geographical advantage can build a true championship squad for a 5 year window. \n\nLuckily for us Danny hit in the draft with Tatum and Brown. The rest is up to how they improve as players and what Danny is willing to do to surround those 2 with the right guys.\n\n### Comment ID g83m0o4 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g83m0o4/) (in reply to ID g81jl27):\ni’ve never understood why top tier nba players didn’t want to come to boston for this reason. are they divas compared to other sports? it seems like the other boston franchises can get top tier or second tier guys.\n\n#### Comment ID g83znxq with +7 score by [(shinyjolteon1, Reddit, 2020-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g83znxq/) (in reply to ID g83m0o4):\nWeather and culture are the two things. \n\nThe NBA is in season in the winter meaning players need to live in Boston during the winter. Most NBA players (at least superstars) prefer a warm climate as they don't have to worry about little things like comfort with humidity or heat since they make a fuck ton of money. Cold is much more pervasive than heat. MLB players don't have to worry about it, the MLB season is spring-fall without the worst of winter. NFL players are out by the end of January and while they do have to go through winter, it isn't all of it. NHL players are a bit of a wild card- unlike NBA/NFL/MLB players, most NHL players are used to the cold being mostly Canadian, northern American, Scandinavian, or Russian. The weather isn't some horrific turn off for them like it is for a young NBA player.  \n\nNBA players are generally the ones that like to go out clubbing and partying more obviously at bare minimum than most MLB/NHL/NFL guys (how many other guys have jokes about them like Paul George and strippers, or Harden and strippers, or Kawhi and stri... you get the point, the biggest I can think of it NHL players can doing rails of coke in bar bathrooms- Bozak, Kadri, Hall are the biggies on that). Boston isn't a town built on the glitz, glamour, and nonstop partying like New York, LA, or Miami that appeals to stars with a thin veneer of gold covering a pile of failed ambitions. We are a town built on actually building shit that applies to real life in the sciences. It is a college town with the best colleges and universities in the country right up there with the best in the world. What is isn't, ZooMass excepted, is a party city- you don't have the crazy parties or clubs that New York, LA, or Miami have. If a college kid just wants to party, they go to ASU not to anywhere here. There is stuff to do absolutely, but most of it focuses on learning or history. LA has no history as a city, Miami has no history as a city, New York has some, but that isn't what you think of with New York. Boston, after colleges, medicine, and banking, has history as a big draw. That isn't an NBA thing- look at Leveon Bell who enjoys slapping ass at strip clubs and riding around jet ski's in Miami who had two places on his wishlist in FA- Miami and New York. Artemi Panarin went right to New York when he hit FA despite having a good team around him in Columbus because his girlfriend could find more work there are a model and they are known for enjoying nights out.\n\nTaxes are another reason- part of why Miami is able to get players there, look at the NHL and the discount deals that guys like Hedman, Stamkos, Kucherov, ect. took to stay in Tampa since they get far more there with no state tax than a player in Boston, Toronto, Montreal, ect.\n\nNBA players also hit FA a bit earlier than any other sport as most come in and play right away at 18/19 and can be a UFA by 25 with a 3 year rookie deal and 4 on a second contract, most MLB free agents don't hit the market until they are 29 or older, the best players are at minimum 26-27. The NHL is about the same, 26 being only for the guys like Tavares, most hit it in the 27-29 range. Look at David Pastrnak, 3 year rookie deal, then signed a 6 year deal as a RFA, no NBA player is gonna sign a 6 year deal- it is 4 with a player option for a 5th year likely that they will decline to make bank at 25. The NFL is a bit different- players can be UFA's by 26 in spite of playing football, but the big names the Pats have signed have been people ring chasing or using BB as a method to get a big contract somewhere else.\n\nThat doesn't sound like much, but the biggest thing I have noticed is players who have a family love Boston. Jarome Iginla played here one year and then moved here full time after retiring because he felt it gave his kids a great education and that was important to him. Guys like Theis, Hayward, IT,  Horford, ect.- the ones with family love Boston as a city. It has a ton of great qualities for a successful family. It doesn't have much to appeal to a young NBA player who likely wants to party, fuck, and enjoy the hell out of their personal life. We see a lot of older people from MA move to places like Florida or Arizona if they can afford it after their families have moved on into their own lives because once they aren't a family, the perks of Boston aren't as important anymore compared to a warmer, easier climate for their bodies. That goes full circle to NBA players without any attachments. \n\nTL;DR: New York, LA, and Miami are the business majors who are built, constantly partying, and having a good time- Boston is the nerdy, in decent shape but not built pre-med major who is focused on academia more than the college experience, NBA players are sorority girls on Tinder who don't give a shit about anything beyond the next 24 hours when they are swiping.\n\n#### Comment ID g83w370 with +7 score by [(pittiv20, Reddit, 2020-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g83w370/) (in reply to ID g83m0o4):\nThe actual answer is because there is legitimately nothing for a rich black man to do in Boston.

Watching the Lakers clinch on the court must be too devastating to them. Look at Pierce here:\n\n[http://archive.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2010/06/18/no\\_banner/](http://archive.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2010/06/18/no_banner/)\n\nWhat? the Celtics didn't deliberately lose earlier? then they weren't good enough to lose to the Lakers in the finals in order to maintain a 9-3 H2H record. Why is it then a credit to the Celtics? They sat home 14 times when the Lakers clinched.\n\nI know, I know, the Lakers lost 15 times in the finals, you folks say? Yet the Celtics lost 15 times in the Conference Finals (called Eastern Division Finals in the early years) in 53, 54, 55, 67, 72, 73, 75, 80, 82, 88, 02, 12, 17, 18, and 20. Yep, try to tell me losing in the Conference finals is a greater honor than losing in the finals. It sure pads their finals record of 17-4 and 9-3 H2H vs the Lakers really good.\n\n2020 is a great year.

See how many top tier free agents went there and how many players indicated they wanted to be traded there. Shaq, Howard, Nash, Gasol, AD (who didn't want to go to Celtics mind you!), Lebron. How many decent 2nd tier, like Artest? Meanwhile Boston just had the KG + Ray Allen and recently Kemba, Kyrie was traded here and him being a cancer he left, so I don't even count that as a good trade. The rest they had to draft. Even Clippers are more attractive to players, cause it's in LA.\n\nKnicks might be worth more, but LA is THE team in NBA, they have it easy like Real Madrid in Spain - they are funded by the crown of Spain. Other teams like Boston, Miami, OKC and Bucks are more impressive cause they had to build it on their own. And Laker fans still think they were fucked on the CP3 non-trade. Puh-lease, if the league hadn't stepped in it might as well be LALBA (Los Angeles Lakers Basketball League).

They do love the Blazers and Timbers, and sport is huge in the state in general.\n\nThe Portland metro area is probably large and wealthy enough. I feel like NHL hockey would have appeal as something new and different, which kind of fits with the eclectic attitude of the city, and the a lot of the state for that matter. \n\nThe biggest unknown is if there's enough interest to go around between the Blazers and the NHL. I just never knew anyone, friends, or co-workers, that had ever even given hockey a single thought. It would be a pretty raw market to develop fans in—similar to Vegas imo.

The Portland metropolitan area has a population of around 2.45 million, and out of the 50 biggest metro areas in the United States it is ranked 15th in population growth. That gives it a bigger population than the metro areas supporting the Jets, Sabres, Hurricanes, Oilers, Senators, Flames, Predators, Blue Jackets, Golden Knights, and Penguins.\n\nPortland is certainly big enough to support a team, the question is if it would do so. Atlanta is the 10th largest metropolitan area in the United States and Canada, with a metro population of 5.79 million, yet the NHL failed to keep a team in Atlanta *twice* (the Flames were there from 1972 to 1980, and the Thrashers were there from 1999 to 2011). \n\nCould it?

We've seen via Vegas how tremendously well an expansion/relocation can do even outside a \"traditional hockey market\" with the right plan.  But none of that is guaranteed.

Pick an environmental problem, and help scientists working on it write code to model the issue, or identify problems spots. Help them apply ML techniques to build decision engines and predictive models and such. There's *loads* of possible work here, it just pays like shit compared to building a CRUD app for an insurance company or whatever.\n\nI think the reason you take such a pessimistic view is that you view this only from the \"big picture\" perspective. Obviously no one software program is going to solve the whole climate change problem. But specific environmental problems certainly can make use of better software to solve them far more directly than just writing some web app to help people sign up for a mailing list. There's a vast world of difference between tackling coding problems that help people solve real problems in real life... and trying to change the world with the internet.\n\nEach of these huge problems is made up of innumerable small problems--and those small problems are often problems directly addressable by software.\n\n#### Comment ID dwbjyii with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-03-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dwbjyii/) (in reply to ID dwbf8fy):\nOn one hand, yes--I most definitely have a pessimistic view due to the big picture perspective... but how is looking at the totality of the problem not the way to solve it? What matter is it, anyway, if your software can detect fraud when the organizations running these welfare programs don't have the budget to run and maintain it, or if the fraud-doers are backed by corrupt politicians whose contrivances are vast and pockets deep such that anything recorded by the software is easily nullified by bribery? What matter is it if your software can help scientists model natural phenomena and better understand the data, when solving climate change is against the business interests of oligarchs and politicians who, together, can ensure that none of your recommendations are written and enacted into policy and that you will systematically find it difficult to get research funding?\n\nAgain, tools. Software is not going to directly address these problems at large; policy and the implementation thereof by state officials, really, are the direct solutions. Or maybe being a billionaire like Elon Musk--but even his solutions to the most challenging problems of our species which states all over the world are deliberately ignoring aren't software products by themselves. But software is, definitely, one of his tools.\n\n## Comment ID dw97xz5 with +372 score by [(thomas30486, Reddit, 2018-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dw97xz5/) (in reply to ID 87013t):\nI know it's probably not what you were looking for but one of the most effective things you can do is work at a company that isn't detrimental to the world and donate a portion of your income to the relevant charity.

There's just *no jobs*.  \nThe NOAA? They have [33 job openings](https://www.usajobs.gov/Search?k=NOAA&p=1). How important are they? Let's see, whenever you check the weather, you can thank them. Whenever you eat salmon or shrimp, you can thank the NOAA for regulating fisheries and marine gaming to ensure that populations are sustainable and the water near fisheries is clean. They do precious research on ocean acidity, they map glaciers and ice melting rates, they conduct satellite imagery using GIS.  \nThey're one of the most important branches of government for climate change and they have 33 fucking job openings and maybe a third of them are engineering.  \nAnd good luck getting even an interview for it. It's a paid cost of living and accommodations software engineering role in Hawaii.  \nThe last time I applied to the NOAA, I was competing against over 950 other applicants that got *passed* the resume screening, out of a pool of over 4500 resume's submitted. 950 applicants got sent to the phase 1 test and background screening which involves credit check, fingerprint check, references, degree and transcripts and a 2 hour engineering test.  \n75% fail that part and the remaining 25% get put through an additional document/test filter. Only about 30-50 make it to the interview phase.  \nI was cut out from the first round and I had heard I was competing against PhD graduates with over 2 years of experience directly related to the field. Oh and I submitted my resume with a referral from a current employee, it took 13 months for me to get my first response.\n\n#### Comment ID dw9knr2 with +4 score by [(1dayHappy_1daySad, Reddit, 2018-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dw9knr2/) (in reply to ID dw98ei7):\nWoot?\n\n    require \"Universe\"\n    class Earth\n      attr_accessor :global_temp\n      def initialize\n        @global_temp = Universe::Earth.global_temp\n      end\n    end\n    muh_earth = Earth.new\n    muh_earth.global_temp -= 3\n\nGeez you people want everything done for you.\n\n#### Comment ID dw9emv9 with +3 score by [(shaggorama, Reddit, 2018-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dw9emv9/) (in reply to ID dw98ei7):\nThe demand is there, the companies that do that work just can't afford you.\n\n#### Comment ID dwa2o3e with +1 score by [(WillCode4Cats, Reddit, 2018-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dwa2o3e/) (in reply to ID dw98ei7):\nShit, well there goes my next app.\n\n### Comment ID dw9cpfx with +18 score by [(beegreen, Reddit, 2018-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dw9cpfx/) (in reply to ID dw97xz5):\nAlso if you want to be extreme about it don't eat meat or have kids\n\n#### Comment ID dw9d0j2 with +16 score by [(CunningFatalist, Reddit, 2018-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dw9d0j2/) (in reply to ID dw9cpfx):\nOr just be thoughtful in general and teach your children to do so, too.

You need buy-in from the end user and client. Often the success of the system is not really down to how good it is, if its passable thats good enough, what you really need is great people skills and to be able to drive awareness. So to really make a success on this front, focus on those skills too.\n\n## Comment ID dw998ww with +6 score by [(RockleyBob, Reddit, 2018-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dw998ww/) (in reply to ID 87013t):\nNon profits and charities would be thrilled to get someone who can make an app or help modernize their webpage.

The manager to engineer ratio is incredibly large. \r\n\r\nManagement is constantly churning and the new managers are brought in from the outside, never promoted up from within. Groups working in niche fields built up capabilities only to have their efforts redirected by whoever the latest manager was who had no domain expertise. Managers were brought in based on their credentials at the biggest tech companies but the strategies they learned there were inappropriate to the size, scope, and audience of Vulcan projects.  Imagine a 2 person 6 month research project. Now bring in 3 managers who insist on making the prototype 'enterprise grade', halting progress. Be sure to berate the engineers on their way out. Projects managers focus more on reporting progress than progressing. I've never been at an organization which spends the amount of effort this one does to tell employees how great it is to work there. I wish I left sooner.",

It's a culture of fear that will not change because it comes directly from Paul Allen. \"Owner meetings\" as they are called are unpredictable and can go well or poorly depending on Paul's mood. Senior management operates on his whim and therefore the company lacks strategy and clear level-headed directional planning. Senior management will do anything to keep their well-paying jobs: they repeatedly move/alter project goals/direction and blame their employees when projects don't go as planned. Self-preservation at Vulcan is senior management's primary goal.  A series of poor hires at the C-suite level have sent the company reeling. The technology department, in particular, is in upheaval and the new leader has a complete disregard for his team. Company morale has taken another massive beating.",

Provide a path of upward mobility to employees instead of telling young people that there's no where to go within the company for them. Build a culture that cares about problem solving and creativity instead of filling out paperwork.

          "cons": "I’m also very happy to have left. Vulcan lacks paying customers. Without that simple but powerful force, it is hard to keep a company pointed toward true north.\r\n\r\nIn my five years in the tech department, it had about three name changes and 4-6 leadership changes. With each regime change I would feel a new sense of hope. “This guy (note: always a guy) seems like he understands business. He’s not just interested in creating a wacky invention, but he wants to make products for actual human beings.” Inevitably, users would fall to the wayside and we would ultimately build something for a white guy sitting in an ivory tower. While Mr. Allen had good intentions and creative ideas, he often wanted a cutting edge engineering solution to a big humanitarian problem. The non-engineering solutions were too dull. But the engineering solutions were often out of touch.\r\n\r\nOne thing was consistent: the worker bees were passionate about making something amazing and functional. Similar to Mr. Allen, they wanted to make a big impact in people’s’ lives. They researched ways to make science fiction come to life. They are smart, kind, creative, sharing people. However, the people who get promoted spout empty promises. They strut in like Donald Trump, fabricating business models and customer needs.\r\n\r\nIn some ways, it's hard to fault these leaders. When there is no business, then lying with flourish is the best way to personally survive. If they can’t be successful by making a sale, then success has to come from a bloated sense of self worth.\r\n\r\nIn the last regime change, things have gone slightly differently. The customer we designed for was no longer Paul Allen but instead a nonexistent customer who wants futuristic products at a reasonable price. In trying to productize Paul’s ideas, they are taking something developed in a lab and trying to make it a commodity, underfunding any R&amp;D that would maintain differentiation.\r\n\r\nLeadership isn’t taking a strong stance in any direction:\r\n- If it truly wanted to build products, it would expand the team size to function comparably to a competitor. Right now, teams of 2-10 people are trying to create a full scale business.\r\n- If it wanted to operate as a tech transfer office, it would partner with major companies. Instead, it keeps its tech development under wraps.\r\n- If it wanted to be a Google X, it would focus on R&amp;D and build truly futuristic product prototypes and not worry about making a sale.\r\n\r\nVulcan doesn’t know what it is. It never has. It always sat in a technological purgatory, partially because I don’t think Mr. Allen cared enough to commercialize. Without Paul Allen, it loses a leader that had a sci-fi imagination. That might be a good thing since his ideas never touched the ground. It might be a bad thing because there are no longer any ideas.\r\n\r\nRight now, it is trying to commoditize futuristic ideas for an imaginary customer. Best of luck.",

In my opinion, the performance appraisal process here is very counterproductive. Employees are graded on a curve (remember college courses?) HR rejects the notion of \"stack ranking\", but under the hood, managers have to stack rank to determine how their teams members are distributed under the curve. The curve is determined by how well the company and department has been rated that year. The PA and goal-setting processes together extend over several months.",

There are tons of perks that we enjoy here, including quarterly parties, tickets to sporting events, and an amazing year-end event. We even have a 'bring your dog to work' day :)  \r\nAnd let's not forget the Super Bowl (x2!) \r\n\r\nAlso, one of my favorite things about Vulcan is that they have managed to grab the most talented and extraordinary people to do their jobs.

In my opinion, the performance appraisal process here is very counterproductive. Employees are graded on a curve (remember college courses?)

Without that simple but powerful force, it is hard to keep a company pointed toward true north.\r\n\r\nIn my five years in the tech department, it had about three name changes and 4-6 leadership changes. With each regime change I would feel a new sense of hope. “This guy (note: always a guy) seems like he understands business. He’s not just interested in creating a wacky invention, but he wants to make products for actual human beings.” Inevitably, users would fall to the wayside and we would ultimately build something for a white guy sitting in an ivory tower. While Mr. Allen had good intentions and creative ideas, he often wanted a cutting edge engineering solution to a big humanitarian problem. The non-engineering solutions were too dull. But the engineering solutions were often out of touch.\r\n\r\nOne thing was consistent: the worker bees were passionate about making something amazing and functional. Similar to Mr. Allen, they wanted to make a big impact in people’s’ lives. They researched ways to make science fiction come to life. They are smart, kind, creative, sharing people. However, the people who get promoted spout empty promises. They strut in like Donald Trump, fabricating business models and customer needs.\r\n\r\nIn some ways, it's hard to fault these leaders. When there is no business, then lying with flourish is the best way to personally survive. If they can’t be successful by making a sale, then success has to come from a bloated sense of self worth.\r\n\r\nIn the last regime change, things have gone slightly differently. The customer we designed for was no longer Paul Allen but instead a nonexistent customer who wants futuristic products at a reasonable price. In trying to productize Paul’s ideas, they are taking something developed in a lab and trying to make it a commodity, underfunding any R&amp;D that would maintain differentiation.\r\n\r\nLeadership isn’t taking a strong stance in any direction:\r\n- If it truly wanted to build products, it would expand the team size to function comparably to a competitor. Right now, teams of 2-10 people are trying to create a full scale business.\r\n- If it wanted to operate as a tech transfer office, it would partner with major companies. Instead, it keeps its tech development under wraps.\r\n- If it wanted to be a Google X, it would focus on R&amp;D and build truly futuristic product prototypes and not worry about making a sale.\r\n\r\nVulcan doesn’t know what it is. It never has. It always sat in a technological purgatory, partially because I don’t think Mr. Allen cared enough to commercialize. Without Paul Allen, it loses a leader that had a sci-fi imagination. That might be a good thing since his ideas never touched the ground. It might be a bad thing because there are no longer any ideas.\r\n\r\nRight now, it is trying to commoditize futuristic ideas for an imaginary customer. Best of luck.",

      "# [High Alpha Invests in Kevala](https://www.highalpha.com/news/high-alpha-invests-in-kevala)\nKevala Raises $4.0 Million to Provide Intelligent Workforce Management and Care Orchestration Platform for the Fast-Growing Long-Term Care Industry\n\nSEATTLE — January 26, 2021 — Kevala today announced that it has raised $4.0 million to provide long-term care organizations with an intelligent workforce management and care orchestration platform that elevates employee productivity and engagement, improves quality of care and automates compliance. Vulcan Capital led the financing, with participation from Costanoa Ventures, High Alpha and PSL Ventures. Kevala spun out of Pioneer Square Labs last April.\n\nLong-term care, which includes senior living, skilled nursing and rehabilitation, home care, and hospice, is the fastest growing segment of healthcare and represents over 65,000 service providers.\n\n“Long-term care eventually affects all of us, but we in the tech industry have not done our part to properly equip the facilities and people doing the hard work on the front lines,” said Todd Owens, CEO and co-founder of Kevala. “Kevala is on a mission to deliver an integrated and intelligent solution that enables caregivers to spend more time with their patients and residents.”\n\nWith Kevala, long-term care organizations can use the platform to:\n\nAutomate the cumbersome onboarding and credentialing process;\n\nOptimize scheduling to improve labor utilization and eliminate waste;\n\nEliminate unnecessary overtime and associated staff burnout;\n\nOffer in-house caregivers a secure platform to collaborate; and\n\nProvide an efficient marketplace to add supplemental staff when necessary.\n\n“At Aegis, the key to our success has always been our people who provide remarkable, personal, hands-on care to each and every resident,” said Kris Engskov, President of Aegis Living, a national leader in senior assisted living and memory care. “We’re incredibly excited to work with Kevala to develop a unique platform that will enable us to better manage our care team’s time and scheduling - to ensure everyone is in the right place, at exactly the right time - and do it with the same technology they are already using in other parts of their lives.”\n\nWhen healthcare facilities need to employ temporary staff from third-party agencies, Kevala maintains a ready pool of high-quality, credentialed workers so that shifts can be filled without the usual delay, administration, and risk that results from managing transactions over phone and text.\n\n“The sad reality today is that supervisors call down long lists of staffing firms, relying on voice mail and ad-hoc text messages to fill urgent shifts,” said Amy Cheetham, Principal at Costanoa Ventures who joined the board as part of the financing. “It’s an archaic and painful process. We are convinced that Kevala’s solution can provide a better way.”\n\nIn the healthcare industry, compliance is often managed using paper and spreadsheets. Kevala’s solution automates the compliance process from initial hire through the lifecycle of an employee.\n\n“We love that Kevala is attacking the compliance piece of the healthcare system with a modern SaaS solution,” said Scott Dorsey, Managing Partner of High Alpha and former CEO and Chairman of ExactTarget. “This is an area ripe for change as Kevala helps organizations replace their paper and spreadsheets with intelligent software.”\n\nOwens was the former CEO of TalentWise, which was acquired by Sterling Talent Solutions forming the world’s largest background check and credentialing company. After serving as COO of Sterling, Owens then served as CEO of Appuri and Azuqua, which were acquired by Docusign and Okta, respectively.\n\nKevala’s founding team includes Noah Kusz and Patrick Lawler, both of whom were senior executives who worked closely with Owens at Azuqua, as well as Jake Gordon, a former senior technologist at EagleView and LiquidPlanner. The company will use the new funds to hire experienced web and mobile engineers, hire a product leader, and expand its service to additional long-term care organizations.\n\n“Healthcare organizations need modern, intelligent software to help them manage their workforces and improve the lives of their clients and patients,” said Greg Gottesman, Co-Founder and Managing Director of Pioneer Square Labs and PSL Ventures. “Todd is a visionary leader. I couldn’t be more excited to partner with him and the rest of the Kevala team on this unique opportunity.”\n\nAbout Kevala\n\nKevala is an intelligent workforce management and care orchestration platform specifically built to address the unique needs of long-term care organizations, including senior living, skilled nursing and rehabilitation, home care, and hospice. Long-term care is the fastest growing segment of healthcare and yet is the most underserved by technology. By building an\n\nintegrated and intelligent SaaS solution, Kevala is able to maximize employee productivity and engagement, while increasing quality of care and improving the bottom line. For more information, please visit www.kevala.care.\n\nAbout Costanoa Ventures\n\nCostanoa Ventures backs tenacious and thoughtful founders who change how business gets done. Costanoa seeks to be a long-term partner to entrepreneurs building durable companies leveraging data to solve complex business problems.

A total of 33,452 seamounts and 138,412 knolls were identified, representing the largest global set of identified seamounts and knolls to date. Seamount habitat was found to constitute approximately 4.7% of the ocean floor, whilst knolls covered 16.3%.\n\nThe research leading to these results received funding from the European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme, and from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\nConservation International, GRID-Arendal and Geoscience Australia recently collaborated to produce a map of the global distribution of seafloor geomorphic features. The global seafloor geomorphic features map represents an important contribution towards the understanding of the distribution of blue habitats. Certain geomorphic feature are known to be good surrogates for biodiversity. For example, seamounts support a different suite of species to abyssal plains.\n\nGEBCO's aim is to provide the most authoritative publicly-available bathymetry of the world's oceans. It operates under the joint auspices of the International Hydrographic Organization(IHO) and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) (of UNESCO).\n\nGEBCO produces and makes available a range of bathymetric data sets and products. This includes a global bathymetric grid; gazetteer of undersea feature names, a Web Map Service and printable maps of ocean bathymetry.\n\nBio-ORACLE is a set of GIS rasters providing geophysical, biotic and environmental data for surface and benthic marine realms. The data are available for global-scale applications at a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin (approximately 9.2 km at the equator).\n\nLinking biodiversity occurrence data to the physical and biotic environment provides a framework to formulate hypotheses about the ecological processes governing spatial and temporal patterns in biodiversity, which can be useful for marine ecosystem management and conservation.\n\nThe Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4): Population Density, Revision 11 consists of estimates of human population density (number of persons per square kilometer) based on counts consistent with national censuses and population registers, for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. A proportional allocation gridding algorithm, utilizing approximately 13.5 million national and sub-national administrative units, was used to assign population counts to 30 arc-second grid cells.\n\nMinerals are non-renewable resources (at least within human timeframes) but mining them is now apparently a sustainable enterprise, not a one-way street of exploitation.

      "# [Are the Trail Blazers Any Closer to Being Sold? by Dave Deckard, www.facebook.com on 2024-07-31](https://www.blazersedge.com/2024/7/31/24209769/portland-trail-blazers-sale-rumors-jody-allen-nba-tv-rights-deal-broadcast-amount-vulcan-inc-paul)\nThe Portland Trail Blazers have changed coaches, general managers, and floor personnel over the last four years, but their ownership has remained the same throughout. As of July, 2024, Jody Allen and Vulcan Sports still hold controlling interest in the franchise, to the chagrin of many Blazers fans who expect—and perhaps want—the team to be sold. Are we any closer to that event this summer than we were last? That’s the subject of today’s Blazer’s Edge Mailbag.\n\nHello Dave,\n\nWith the new NBA television deal having been finalized, will that make it any more likely that Jody will sell the team to a new owner sooner rather than later? Perhaps she plans to hang on to the team indefinitely? What are your thoughts?\n\nPatrick B\n\nMeddling in the minds of NBA owners is perilous business, but I would guess that finalizing the new broadcast rights deal was a necessary step to setting the price of the team, should it be sold.\n\nLots of people guessed at potential numbers for the new contract. I’m not sure $76 billion over 11 years crossed anyone’s lips until it happened. Surely incumbent owners had a clue, but they couldn’t very well broadcast (ha!) the amount. Nor would it have shown up on organizational ledgers. Until the deal got done, it was vapor and rumor.\n\nNow both seller and buyer have a tangible forecast for this critical revenue stream over the next decade. That’s one of the two major undecided pieces, along with any expansion fees franchises might rake in. And the broadcast deal is by far the bigger.\n\nWith the numbers in place, sellers can now account for the increased value of the franchise during the span of the deal, while buyers can factor in the income from broadcast partners. This makes setting—and paying—a price much easier.\n\nSo I’d guess that if the Trail Blazers are going to be sold anytime soon, we’re one step closer to the transaction...one of the most important steps, at that.\n\nThat said, be careful what you wish for. Who buys the franchise next is going to be just as important as the final price or timing of the sale. Ownership is increasingly becoming the province of billionaires, a trend that late owner Paul Allen helped pioneer. Once upon a time, teams were purchased by fanatical, motivated individuals such as Allen and Mark Cuban. This had advantages and drawbacks, but either way, the owner’s connection to the franchise and its success was personal.\n\nAs the cost of entry soars into the billions, though, corporations are going to start to take over where individuals once ruled. The obsession will shift away from prestige and winning towards efficiency and the bottom line. That could spell disaster for a small-market franchise like Portland.\n\nWhenever the Blazers are moved, let’s hope they fall into the hands of someone who cares rather than the Executive Vice President of Sports and Marketing in some investment firm, simply looking to run the project for financial leverage. Call me stupid, but I’ll take a billionaire cowboy over an umbrella organization every time.",

      "# [Wikipedia by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2003-06-17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechTV)\nCable channel\n\nTelevision channel\n\nTechTV was a 24-hour cable and satellite channel based in San Francisco featuring news and shows about computers, technology, and the Internet. In 2004, it merged with the G4 gaming channel which ultimately dissolved TechTV programming. At the height of its six-year run, TechTV was broadcast in 70 countries, reached 43 million households, and claimed 1.9 million unique visitors monthly to its website.[1] A focus on personality-driven product reviews and technical support made it a cultural hub for technology information worldwide, still existing today online through its former hosts' webcasts, most notably the TWiT Network.\n\nThe offices were located at 650 Townsend Street, 94103,[2] and the studios, of which there were two, were located at 535 York Street, 94110.[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nOrigins\n\n[edit]\n\nOn August 20, 1994, computer magazine publisher Ziff Davis entered the television industry with the premiere of The Personal Computing Show, a program that aired on Saturday mornings on CNBC, America's Talking and the Jones Computing Network. The Personal Computing Show, co-hosted by Jim Louderback and Gina Smith, targeted a growing demographic of personal computer owners and demonstrated how to purchase, install, maintain and repair personal computers and peripheral devices such as printers. Shortly after The Personal Computing Show's premiere, Ziff Davis revealed plans to produce a second show in October 1994 named PC Update, a half-hour Sunday morning news program hosted by Leo Laporte and focusing on the computer industry.[4][5] According to Ziff Davis spokesman Gregory Jarboe, The Personal Computing Show was unsuccessful due to its relegation to odd channels and timeslots.[6] When Ziff Davis' sale to investment firm Forstmann Little & Company was announced in October 1994, a small Foster City-based television operation named \"ZD-TV\" was listed as a company asset.[7]\n\nIn April 1996, Ziff Davis announced the establishment of ZDTV as a San Francisco-based unit specializing in the production of television and internet broadcasts, which would allow the publisher to showcase its products. Its first project was to develop The Site, a daily hour-long prime time news show co-hosted by Soledad O'Brien about the increasing social and economic effects of technology. The program aired on the cable news network MSNBC, which launched on July 15, 1996.[8][9] It was the third San Francisco-based television program specializing in technology after CNET Central and Cyberlife.[10] According to Ziff Davis chief executive Larry Wangberg,[6] San Francisco was chosen as ZDTV's headquarters for its proximity to Silicon Valley and easy access to Multimedia Gulch-based talent.[11]\n\nOn May 6, 1997, Ziff Davis announced its plan to launch ZDTV as a 24-hour interactive cable network specializing in computers and the Internet. The publisher put $100 million behind the project and planned to debut the ZDTV channel in early 1998. Projected programming for the channel included talk shows on the impact of technology, business-oriented shows evaluating investments in high-tech stocks, and reviews of software and hardware.[12] Children's programming was also planned for the weekends.[13] The channel had 11 initial charter advertisers, including IBM, Gateway 2000, Microsoft, and Charles Schwab.[12] Ziff Davis chairman and CEO Eric Hippeau cited the increasing presence of computers in cable television homes and workspaces as motivation for filling the niche of programming about computers, saying \"This is a huge audience and it will only get bigger\".[13] Wangberg, who would be made the network's CEO, proclaimed Ziff Davis' ambition of ZDTV becoming \"to computing what CNN is to news, what ESPN is to sports\".[11] Although Ziff Davis intended to continue producing The Site for MSNBC following ZDTV's launch,[14] the show was canceled in September 1997 as a result of the network's shift toward an all-news format.[6][15] In December 1997, Ziff Davis revealed at the Western Cable Trade Show in Anaheim that it had secured agreements with four cable operators to carry the network: Prime Cable in Las Vegas, Harron Communications in Detroit, Televue in Georgia, and Prestige Cable in Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland.[6]\n\nZDTV\n\n[edit]\n\nZDTV was initially set to launch at the end of 1998's first quarter, but was delayed by Ziff Davis' initial public offering, which was announced on February 18.[11] The network launched on Monday May 11, 1998, on cable systems in Las Vegas, Detroit, parts of Georgia near Atlanta and parts of Maine.[16] On August 1, 1998, ZDTV was broadcast in its native San Francisco when the channel struck a deal with DirecTV to become available on Channel 273 via the providers' satellite dishes.[17] In November 1998, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's holding company Vulcan Ventures invested $54 million in ZDTV, granting it a 33 percent stake in the network.[18]\n\nAlthough ZDTV was critically acclaimed, it struggled to gain a foothold in AT&T/TCI cable lineups,[19] and was deemed unprofitable. In an effort to sell company assets to reduce debt and boost its share price,[20] Ziff Davis put ZDTV up for sale on July 16, 1999. In November 1999, Vulcan purchased the remaining two-thirds in a transaction that was completed on January 21, 2000. The deal (which permitted the network to retain its name) was worth $204.8 million.[19][21] On August 21, 2000, ZDTV announced that it would be changing its name to TechTV the following month, and would simultaneously be added to AT&T and Time Warner Cable's digital cable lineups.[22][23]\n\nTechTV\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 15, 2001, TechTV announced that it had laid off an approximate of a dozen employees as part of a reorganization effort in the face of the waning dot-com bubble.[24] On April 2, the nine-hour live programming block Tech Live, which the network described as the \"nucleus of TechTV's daytime programming\", was launched.[25]\n\nOn November 16, TechTV announced another layoff of 130 employees. This, combined with the reduction of Tech Live and indifferent online reactions to TechTV's struggles, were interpreted by Wired News' Farhad Manjoo as a sign of declining cultural interest in technology. Anonymous TechTV employees remarked that the increasingly ubiquitous nature of the Internet had rendered the network's mission statement \"a bit fantastical\", and suggested that the only reason the network was still in business was because \"Allen doesn't know what to do with his billions\".[26] In the spring of 2002, TechLive was cut further into just one thirty-minute daily news magazine show, with a focus less on tech news and more on technology's cultural aspect.[27] In 2002, Silicon Spin (an opinion forum hosted by PC Magazine editor John C. Dvorak from the original ZDTV launched in May 1998) and AudioFile (a show for digital music enthusiasts launched in August 2000) were canceled, with its hosts being absorbed onto other network programs. 2003 saw the introduction of several new shows (such as Performance, Robot Wars, and Unscrewed with Martin Sargent).\n\nTechTV was also broadcast over the air on KTQW in Wichita, Kansas until the TechTV name was dropped during the G4 merger.[28]\n\nInternational distribution\n\n[edit]\n\nA Canadian version of TechTV launched on September 7, 2001, as a joint venture of TechTV, Rogers Media, and Shaw Communications. The channel would later become G4techTV Canada to coincide with the American merger of TechTV and G4. The channel would change its name once again in mid-2009 to G4 Canada. In 2004, TechTV launched on Foxtel Digital in Australia. After the merger with G4, TechTV (then called G4techTV) left Australia lineups as its international feed ceased. On Malaysia's ASTRO platform, repeats of the international feed was run for some time after the international feed ceased before starting to import G4TV programming and retransmitting them locally on the same channel as the public educational service TV Pendidikan from 2002 to 2006. In Japan, Sony's So-net channel aired several TechTV programs until the fall of 2005 (they aired reruns after May 2004). In New Zealand, TechTV aired on Saturn Communications's channel 34 until May 2004. In addition to those countries, TechTV was broadcast internationally in the United Kingdom.\n\nMerger and consolidation\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 25, 2004, Comcast's G4 gaming channel announced a merger with TechTV. This move became hugely controversial among loyal fans of TechTV and Leo Laporte, who, because of a contract dispute with Vulcan, left the channel. Shows with Laporte, including The Screen Savers and Call for Help, continued on with remaining staff taking over his hosting duties.\n\nAround May 6, 2004, G4 announced the termination of 250 employees from the San Francisco office by July 16, 2004, allowing approximately 80 to 100 employees to transition to G4's main office in Los Angeles if they agreed to relocate there.[29] Shows from TechTV that were not redundant to G4's offerings continued on until July, when the closing of the TechTV Offices would close the respective stages for these shows in turn.\n\nOn May 10, 2004, G4 Media completed the acquisition of TechTV from Vulcan. G4techTV was launched in the U.S. on May 28, 2004. This led to the cancellation of many of the TechTV channels throughout carriers across the world (e.g.: systems with both channels active, systems limiting Comcast's number of channels on their lineup, etc.) On January 3, 2005, TechTV International began airing select programs from G4techTV. After the closure deadline passed on July 16, 2004, only Los Angeles produced shows would air on the new channel. The final production originating at TechTV in San Francisco was the September 2, 2004, episode of The Screen Savers (which was taped on July 16, 2004).\n\nOn February 15, 2005, the TechTV brand was dropped from the United States G4techTV feed, leaving the network name as G4 – Video Game Television which also echoed the changes in programming made to the channel due to the merger for both G4's original offering and the greatly diminished TechTV originated shows; after that, G4 went through a rebranding and changed most of its programming to position itself as a male-oriented network.\n\nPrograms\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following is a partial list of programs aired by TechTV.\n\nOriginal programming\n\n[edit]\n\nAudioFile – a weekly program focusing on technology's increasing role in the music industry.[30]\n\nBig Thinkers – a weekly interactive program that conducts interviews with the technology industry's visionaries.[30][31][32][33]\n\nCall for Help – a prime-time interactive program in which viewers can call, email or netcam for assistance in solving computer problems.[30][31][32][33]\n\nComputer Shopper – a weekly program that provides information about computer hardware and software products and how to buy them intelligently.[31]\n\nCyberCrime – a weekly program that investigates dangers to computer users such as fraud, hacking, viruses, cybersex crimes, and invasions of privacy.[30][32][33][34]\n\nDigital Avenue – a prime-time program in which manufacturers present in-depth demonstrations of their latest products.[31]\n\nEye Drops – a weekly showcase of computer-animated shorts.[35]\n\nFresh Gear – a weekly program that reviews technological gadgets.[30][31][32][33]\n\nInternet Tonight – a prime-time program showcasing people and personalities who specialize in the Internet.[30][31][32]\n\nInvent This! – a weekly prime-time program showcasing inventors.[33]\n\nMicrosoft Insider Live – a pair of special live events that aired on October 5 and November 2, 2002.

      "# [Moda Center by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2003-07-09](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moda_Center)\nSports arena in Portland, Oregon\n\nModa Center, formerly known as the Rose Garden, is the primary indoor sports arena in Portland, Oregon, United States. It is used for basketball, rodeos, circuses, conventions, ice shows, concerts, and dramatic productions. The arena has a capacity of 20,500 spectators when configured for basketball.[2] It is equipped with state-of-the-art acoustics and other amenities.[8]\n\nThe arena is owned by Jodi Allen, Vulcan Inc., a holding company owned by the estate of Paul Allen. The primary tenant is the Portland Trail Blazers NBA franchise, also owned by Allen's estate. In addition, the Portland WNBA team will make its debut in the arena in 2026.\n\nThe other major tenant of the building was the major junior hockey franchise Portland Winterhawks of the Western Hockey League, which used to split its schedule with the Memorial Coliseum next door. In addition to the Blazers and Winterhawks, several other professional sports franchises, and the Portland State University men's basketball team, either currently play home games in Moda Center, or have done so in the past. In addition, Moda Center is a popular venue for concerts and other artistic productions.[9]\n\nConstruction began in 1993, and the arena opened on October 12, 1995. The arena cost US$262 million to build; construction was financed with funds obtained by a variety of sources, including the City of Portland, Allen's personal fortune, and $155 million in bonds issued by a consortium of mutual funds and insurance companies.[10] These bonds would become the subject of an acrimonious 2004 bankruptcy in which the Oregon Arena Corporation, the holding company which owned the arena at the time, would forfeit title to the arena in lieu of repaying the bonds per the payment terms.[11] Allen would later repurchase the arena from the creditors in 2007.[12]\n\nDescription\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information on transportation and parking: Rose Quarter § Transportation and parking\n\nModa Center is a multipurpose arena which is suitable for numerous indoor sports, including basketball, ice hockey, arena football, and lacrosse, as well as for hosting other events such as concerts, conventions, and circuses.[8] The arena is located in a sports and entertainment district known as the Rose Quarter, a parcel of land in inner northeast Portland which also includes the Memorial Coliseum arena, as well as several parking structures, restaurants, and other amenities.\n\nName\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original name of the facility was \"Rose Garden\"; however, the arena was also commonly known as the \"Rose Garden Arena\" to disambiguate it from the International Rose Test Garden, also located in Portland. The name was chosen both to reflect Portland's reputation as the Rose City,[13] and to reflect the importance to basketball heritage of Boston Garden and Madison Square Garden arenas in Boston and New York City, respectively. When the name was selected, the remainder of the former coliseum grounds were given the name \"Rose Quarter\".\n\nIn 2007, the Trail Blazers and Vulcan announced that they were seeking a corporate partner to grant naming rights for the facility, with the goal of a new name being available for the Blazers' 2008–09 season.[14] In August 2013, the Trail Blazers announced a 10-year deal with Moda Health, an Oregon-based health insurance provider, to rename the arena Moda Center.[15]\n\nThe renaming spurred a public outcry and petition by fans and Portlanders who preferred the old name. Portland mayor Charlie Hales initially expressed concern about the name, calling it a \"head scratcher\".[16]\n\nStructure and architecture\n\n[edit]\n\nModa Center is a precast concrete-framed structure with a roof made up of skeletal steel. The arena structure encloses a total of over 785,000 square feet (72,900 m2), on eight levels, five of which are open to the public. The building height is 140 feet (43 m), from the event floor to the pinnacle of the saddle-shaped roof.[8] The arena includes a 60-by-40-foot (18 m × 12 m) permanent stage, and a 200-by-85-foot (61 m × 26 m) ice rink.[17]\n\nThe building is composed of over 48,000 cubic yards (37,000 m3) of concrete, and over 9,700 short tons (8,800 t) of steel. The exterior is composed of over 29,000 square feet (2,700 m2) of glass, 17,500 square feet (1,630 m2) of plaster, 52,000 square feet (4,800 m2) of architectural precast, 39,000 square feet (3,600 m2) of insulation, and 13,654 square feet (1,268.5 m2) of steel louvers.[8][18]\n\nThe building, designed by architecture firm Ellerbe Becket, has been criticized by some in Portland's architectural community. A survey of local architects and planners was conducted by the Portland Tribune, and subsequently Moda Center was listed among the five ugliest buildings in the city.[19]\n\nSeating\n\n[edit]\n\nThe arena has a total of over 14,000 permanent seats arranged in two bowls. An additional 1540 permanent seats are found in the arena's 70 skyboxes. Over 4,200 portable seats may or may not be installed, depending on the arena's configuration.[17] When configured for basketball, the arena has a capacity of 19,393, and can accommodate a total of up to 20,796 patrons with standing room. Prior to the 1998 NBA season the capacity was reduced to 19,980 from the original 21,485 spectators.[20] When configured for hockey or lacrosse, capacity decreases to 17,544. The arena supports numerous other configurations for events such as concerts, monster trucks, and circuses.[8] The seating below the suites, known as the lower bowl, is further divided into the 100 and 200 levels. The upper bowl seats, above the suites, are the 300 level.[8]\n\nSkyboxes and suites\n\n[edit]\n\nThe arena features 70 Suites and 8 Skyboxes each with a seating capacity of 22 guests. Suites include amenities such as a wet bar, catering, a private restroom, multiple television monitors, and a sound system.[8] Suites may be rented on a yearly[21] or single-event[22] basis; yearly renters of suites are given access to all Moda Center events. The arena also features modular party suites, which can be configured either as a pair of 44-person Super Suites, or as one 88-person mega suite.[23]\n\nTheater of the Clouds\n\n[edit]\n\nFor smaller, more intimate events, Moda Center can be placed into a configuration known as the \"Theater of the Clouds\". This configuration, part of a trend of large arenas having smaller theater configurations,[24] places the stage at center court, and utilizes the western side of the arena.[25] Custom floor-to-ceiling theater curtains are draped at the edges of the seating area, creating a more intimate setting. As of 2004, on average 10 events per year have been held in the Theater of the Clouds configuration.[26] The Theater of the Clouds configuration seats 6,500, with 16 of the 70 luxury boxes being usable.[27]\n\nAmenities\n\n[edit]\n\nTwo concourses, the 100 level and the 300 level, are open to the ticket-buying public during events; the 100 level concourse provides access to the lower bowl (including the 200-level seats); the 300-level concourse provides access to the upper bowl. A third concourse, the 200 level, provides access to guest services such as a sports bar, a barbecue grill, an executive banquet facility, and several outdoor terraces. A fourth concourse, known as Suite Level, provides access to the skyboxes and is restricted to patrons who have skybox admission. All concourses provide a variety of concession stands. The arena also features 32 public restrooms; women's toilets outnumber men's toilets 3 to 1.[8] There are Wi-Fi hotspots throughout the arena.[23] The concourses are decorated with historical memorabilia.[28]\n\nThe primary scoreboard is a Mitsubishi-manufactured HD video scoreboard. This scoreboard, which hangs from the ceiling over center court, features four 15 feet by 22.5 feet (4.5 m by 6.75 m) video screens, among the biggest in the NBA.[23] The arena also features over 650 television monitors placed throughout,[8] showing the action on court. Auxiliary scoreboards located both in the arena itself and the concourses provide statistical information, including \"hustle\" statistics for basketball (rebounds, blocked shots, and steals). Three media towers, one at each main entrance, provide video of other games in the NBA.[28]\n\nAcoustics\n\n[edit]\n\nA unique feature found in no other multi-purpose arena is known as the \"acoustical cloud\". The acoustical cloud is a set of 160 rotating acoustic panels suspended from the Moda Center ceiling, intended to recreate the roar of noise that made the old Memorial Coliseum one of the loudest buildings in the NBA. One side of each 10 feet by 10 feet (3 m by 3 m) panel reflects sound, while the other side absorbs sound. Each panel is shaped like an airplane wing, and is 8 inches (20 cm) thick at the center and 4 inches (10 cm) thick at the edges. The effect during Blazers games is to absorb the noise from the upper levels and reflect it back down to the court.\n\nThe panels permit the acoustics of the arena to be adjusted according to the requirements of the event. For smaller events in which only the lower bowl of the arena is used, the panels can be lowered to further improve the sound and increase the intimacy of the arena. The acoustical cloud cost US$2 million to design and install.[29] The arena is also equipped with a JBL sound system.[23] The acoustics of Moda Center have been widely praised compared to similar venues.[26]\n\nOwnership and management\n\n[edit]\n\nModa Center is currently owned by Vulcan Sports and Entertainment, a holding company owned by the Estate of Paul Allen which manages Allen's various sports-related properties. Management and operation of Moda Center, along with other Rose Quarter facilities, is contracted out to Global Spectrum,[30] Global Spectrum employs more than 75 full-time and 700 part-time employees at Moda Center.[31] Mike Scanlon is the current general manager of the arena. Global Spectrum was first hired by arena creditors to operate the facility after Allen lost possession of the arena in a bankruptcy proceeding; Allen has subsequently repurchased the arena from creditors.[32] Prior to the bankruptcy, Oregon Arena Corporation operated the arena directly; Global Spectrum has been widely praised for increasing the financial performance of the facility.[9] In July 2024, City of Portland entered an agreement to purchase Moda Center for $7.13 million.[33]\n\nTenants\n\n[edit]\n\nThe arena's current primary tenant is the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA. Both the Trail Blazers and Moda Center are ultimately owned by the estate of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, which also owns the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League. The head of the estate is his sister Jody Allen. The Trail Blazers have a lease agreement with Moda Health which runs through 2025,[34] and an exclusive site agreement with the City of Portland requires the team to remain in Portland through 2023.[35]\n\nIt was home to the Portland Winterhawks of the Western Hockey League, a Canadian-based junior hockey league. Both the Trail Blazers and Winterhawks previously played in the Memorial Coliseum and moved to the arena when it was completed in 1995. However, the Winterhawks played home games in both facilities during the season. Moda Center and Winterhawks hold the Western Hockey League's record for single game attendance with a crowd of 14,103 on March 15, 1997, in which Portland tied the visiting Seattle Thunderbirds, 6–6. Prior to the start of the 2021-22 WHL season, the Winterhawks announced they will be moving back to Veterans Memorial Coliseum full-time.[36]\n\nThe arena was also built to accommodate an NHL franchise and there has been speculation over the years about Portland landing an NHL team; however this has not occurred. A former third tenant was the Portland Lumberjax of the National Lacrosse League, who played four seasons in the arena prior to disbanding.[37][38]\n\nThe arena has hosted numerous other minor league sports teams as well. In 1997, an AFL team landed in Portland from Memphis as the Portland Forest Dragons. Two seasons later, they relocated to Oklahoma City. The arena started hosting another AFL team, the Portland Steel (originally called the Portland Thunder), from 2014 until it disbanded in 2016.[39] From 2000 through 2002, the facility hosted the now-defunct Portland Fire of the WNBA. In the past, the Portland State Vikings men's basketball team has played home games in the arena; currently, the team plays its home games at Viking Pavilion on the PSU campus.[40]\n\nOn September 18, 2024, the WNBA announced their a new team to play in Portland, which will bring the league back to both the arena and Portland for the first time since 2002.[41]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the early 1980s, as the National Basketball Association increased in popularity, it became apparent that the 12,888-seat Memorial Coliseum, which was the home of the Portland Trail Blazers at the time, was no longer an adequate NBA facility. The Trail Blazers had sold out every home game since April 5, 1977.[42] In 1988, the team was purchased by Paul Allen and made appearances in the NBA Finals in 1990 and 1992. Allen soon expressed a desire to build a new arena for his team, and in 1991 chartered the Oregon Arena Corporation, a private corporation with Allen as the sole shareholder, to build and operate a new facility.[10] The team soon made an agreement with the City of Portland to build a new multi-purpose arena on the Coliseum's parking lot.[43]\n\nA major factor in the choice of the site for the new arena was its close proximity to transit, with MAX Light Rail and bus service at TriMet's Coliseum Transit Center (later renamed Rose Quarter Transit Center) being adjacent to the site. In July 1995, the Portland Business Journal quoted the Trail Blazers' then-president Marshall Glickman as saying, \"There is no doubt that transit made it possible for us to build here. The thing that burns everyone in terms of financing big projects like this is parking. The fact that we have a [light rail] stop outside our front door, and the potential for what we'll get with the south/north line made this the only place for us to build.\"[44] (The \"south/north\" MAX line referred to was a then-planned line from Clackamas Town Center to Vancouver via downtown Portland, which was canceled in 1996, but partially revived several years later, with the MAX Yellow Line connecting Moda Center with areas to the north.)\n\nFinancing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe financing of the construction of the facility was widely hailed at the time as a good example of public-private partnership; most of the costs were borne by Allen and/or Allen-owned companies, rather than by taxpayers.[45] The bulk of the $262 million[10] construction costs were funded by a $155 million loan from a consortium of lenders led by pension fund TIAA-CREF. As Allen was unwilling to guarantee the loan with his personal finances, the lenders demanded an interest rate of 8.99%, with no opportunity for prepayment.[46] Other major creditors included Prudential Insurance, and Farmers Insurance.[47]\n\nThe remainder of funds came from the City of Portland ($34.5 million), Allen himself ($46 million), with the final $10 million coming from a bond backed by box office and parking revenues.[48] In addition, the City transferred to Allen the underlying land. The city maintains ownership of the Memorial Coliseum and the adjacent parking garages, but the right to manage these was also transferred to Allen. In exchange, Allen signed an exclusive site agreement with the city requiring the Trail Blazers to play all home games in Portland for 30 years[35] The City of Portland hoped that the building of the arena would lead to other renovation or development in the Rose Quarter district, but as of 2021 this has yet to materialize.[49]\n\nConstruction and opening\n\n[edit]\n\nGround on the arena was broken in 1993, and the arena opened on October 12, 1995.[50] The project included the largest construction and demolition recycling program in the U.S. up to that time, in which 32,700 tonnes (32,200 long tons; 36,000 short tons) of construction waste and 308,400 tonnes (303,500 long tons; 340,000 short tons) of dirt were recycled, saving OAC over $127,000. This effort later won the project an environmental award from the city.[51]\n\nThe first concert held in the arena was held two weeks after opening, when David Bowie performed on October 25, with Nine Inch Nails opening.[52] The first regular-season game to be played at the facility was the Trail Blazers hosting the then-Vancouver Grizzlies on November 3, 1995, a 92–80 defeat for the home team.[10] The arena was originally capable of seating 20,340 spectators for NBA basketball. Its capacity has since been reduced to 19,393 by subsequent modifications. At the time of its construction, the arena was a state-of-the-art facility. Although more recent NBA arenas have surpassed Moda Center in amenities, it still is well regarded as a facility.[28] A 2005 survey by USA Today ranked the facility in the middle of the pack among the 29 NBA arenas; factors unrelated to the venue itself (such as ticket prices and entertainment offerings) are considered in the rankings.[53]\n\nSoon after the arena opened, it was the subject of several lawsuits seeking to enforce the Americans with Disabilities Act. One lawsuit (United States v. Ellerbe Becket, Inc.) was filed by the United States Department of Justice against architect Ellerbe-Becket; another (Independent Living Resources v. Oregon Arena Corporation) was filed by a disabled advocacy group against OAC. Both lawsuits alleged that Moda Center (and other facilities designed by Ellerbe Becket) did not provide adequate seating for patrons using wheelchairs, and that the line-of-sight of patrons in wheelchairs was frequently obstructed by standing spectators.[54] The first case was settled with a consent decree, wherein Ellerbe Becket agreed to design future projects in compliance with the ADA;[55] the lawsuit against Oregon Arena Corp was resolved in 1998 when OAC agreed to install over one hundred elevated seats permitting wheelchair-using patrons to see over standing spectators in front.[56]\n\nOregon Arena Corporation bankruptcy\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Rose Garden arena bankruptcy\n\nClaiming the local economy was responsible for reduced revenues which made it unable to make payments on the loans used to finance construction, the Oregon Arena Corporation filed for bankruptcy on February 27, 2004. After negotiations concurrent with the bankruptcy failed to produce a settlement, the United States Bankruptcy Court ordered on November 8 of that year that the Oregon Arena Corporation transfer the facility to the creditors.[57] A new corporation owned by the creditors, Portland Arena Management (PAM) took over operation of the arena.[11] PAM in turn hired Global Spectrum to operate the arena. For several years, the Trail Blazers (still owned by Allen) and the Portland Arena Management had a highly hostile relationship,[58] with the two entities competing for ticket sales.[59]\n\nThe team made numerous complaints about a \"broken economic model\",[60] and there was much speculation that the Trail Blazers might leave.[61] The team was put up for sale in the summer of 2006,[62] only to be taken off the market again several months later.[63] Speculation intensified as to what would happen,[64] and the team and Paul Allen were roundly criticized in the media.[47][64][65][66][67] Despite the criticism and the team's poor finances the team insisted that bankruptcy was the right move.[68]\n\nEarly in 2007, Allen and the creditors reached an agreement for Allen to repurchase the arena, and the team and the building were united under common ownership once more.[12] After much speculation that Allen would hire Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) to replace Global Spectrum, arena management elected to extend Global Spectrum's management contract by one year in the summer of 2007.[31] In September 2007, Global Spectrum announced that the arena would undergo $13 million in renovations.[23]\n\nNotable events\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile Moda Center has never hosted the NBA Finals (Portland's last appearance in the Finals was in 1992, three years before the arena opened), it has hosted three NBA Western Conference Finals series: in 1999 vs. the San Antonio Spurs; in 2000 vs. the Los Angeles Lakers; and in 2019 vs. the Golden State Warriors. One NBA-related event Moda Center—and for that matter, the Trail Blazers franchise—has never hosted is the NBA All-Star Game. The Trail Blazers are one of several franchises to never host an All-Star game; the Blazers' All-Star drought of 42 years is second only to the Boston Celtics, who last hosted the game in 1964. According to the Oregon Sports Authority, the main issue is hotel space close to the arena; the city of Portland lacks the large \"headquarters\" hotel needed to host the NBA and media entourage which accompanies the game.[69]\n\nModa Center has also hosted PBR Built Ford Tough Series bull riding events.\n\nThe arena has hosted various WWE events, including Unforgiven in 2004, No Mercy in 2008, and NXT TakeOver: Portland in 2020. The arena has also hosted various episodes of Raw and SmackDown.[70]\n\nThe arena has also hosted UFC 102 in 2009.\n\nIn 2004, Portland was selected as one of five cities in the U.S. to host the Dew Action Sports Tour, a new extreme sports franchise to start in 2005. Titled the Vans Invitational, the event was held at the Rose Quarter from August 17 to 21. The Rose Quarter hosted BMX: Dirt and Freestyle Motocross. The Dew Action Sports returned to Portland for a third year.[71]\n\nIn the winter of 2005, the Rose Quarter hosted the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, an event attended by over 100,000 spectators.[72] The arena would later host the 2007 NLL All Star Game on March 10, 2007.[73]\n\nIn 2009, the arena hosted first- and second-round games of the NCAA men's basketball tournament as well as in 2015 and 2022. It was the first time NCAA men's tournament games were played in the state of Oregon since 1983, though the arena did host the finals of the 2008 Big Sky Conference men's basketball tournament. The state had been under an NCAA-imposed tournament embargo due to sports betting being legal in the state (specifically, the Oregon Lottery's \"Sports Action\" game, a parlay game which allowed bettors to wager on NFL games), but was awarded 2009 tournament games when the state Legislature eliminated Sports Action from the lottery's lineup.[74] In addition to sports, the arena regularly hosts numerous other types of events, including concerts, circuses, ice shows, and conventions.[8] Portland State University holds its spring commencement ceremonies at the arena.[75]\n\nNotable non-sports related events include the 1998 Portland State commencement ceremony, where the keynote speaker was then U.S. President Bill Clinton. The President, speaking before a packed house in the Garden (including a graduating class of 2000), gave a speech embracing immigration to the United States, and was also awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the university.[76]\n\nOn June 27, 2000, a concert by former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters at the arena became the basis for the concert video In the Flesh: Live.[77]\n\nOn April 24, 2012, British rock band Coldplay performed a sold-out show at the arena as part of their Mylo Xyloto Tour. On October 2, 2017, the band came back to the arena during their A Head Full of Dreams Tour. The band covered Free Fallin' with Peter Buck of R.E.M. there as a tribute to Tom Petty following his death that day.[78]\n\nLady Gaga performed at the arena on January 15, 2013, as part of her Born This Way Ball tour trek through North America. This was one of the few shows the singer completed in the United States before she was forced to cancel the remainder of the tour due to a labral tear of the hip.[79]\n\nOn Sunday, August 9, 2015, Bernie Sanders held a campaign rally at Moda Center that was attended by over 28,000 people.[80]\n\nOn April 9, 2017, Radiohead performed at the arena for the first time during their A Moon Shaped Pool tour. It was also their first concert in Portland since 1996.[81]\n\nOn October 1, 2019, AJR headlined the theater in Moda Center for their Neotheater World Tour.\n\nThe exterior of Moda Center was featured in How I Met Your Mother's 2011 episode, Tick Tick Tick; again in the 2013 episode Platonish, and the series finale episode, Last Forever.\n\nThe exterior of Moda Center was also featured in iCarly's 2009 episode, iFight Shelby Marx.\n\nOn August 22, 2021, Guns N' Roses played a show as part of their 2020 Tour.\n\nOn November 8, 2021, Harry Styles performed a sold-out show as part of his Love On Tour.\n\nOn March 29, 2022, Dua Lipa performed a sold-out show as part of her Future Nostalgia Tour.\n\nOn April 5, 2022, Olivia Rodrigo performed a sold-out show as the first show on her Sour Tour.[82]\n\nOn June 27, 2022, Shawn Mendes performed a sold-out show, as the first show on his Wonder: The World Tour.\n\nOn November 4, 2022, Lizzo performed a sold-out show on her The Special Tour. 6 days later, on November 10, 2022, she performed another sold-out show on the same tour.\n\nOn April 24, 2024, AJR performed their second show in the arena.\n\nOn August 10, 2024, Olivia Rodrigo performed her second show in the arena on her Guts World Tour.\n\nOn September 5, 2024, Gracie Abrams kicked off her The Secret of Us Tour with a sold-out show.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of sports venues in Portland, Oregon\n\nList of indoor arenas in the United States\n\nVeterans Memorial Coliseum (Portland, Oregon)\n\nList of indoor arenas by capacity\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nRose Quarter official website\n\nVulcan, Inc. official website\n\nGlobal Spectrum official website\n\nPortland Trail Blazers official website\n\nPortland Winterhawks official website",
