  "summary_markdown": "# About Vulcan Inc.\n\nVulcan Inc. was founded in 1986 by Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, to manage his business and philanthropic activities. The company operates in various sectors, including technology, real estate, and conservation efforts. Following Allen's death in October 2018, Vulcan Inc. has continued under the leadership of his sister, Jody Allen, who oversees the company's philanthropic initiatives and business ventures [(Gee, I Programmer, 2023)](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/82-heritage/17430-paul-allens-enigma-machine-under-the-hammer.html).\n\nVulcan Inc. is involved in real estate through Vulcan Real Estate, which focuses on sustainable development projects in the Pacific Northwest. The company aims to enhance the quality of life by fostering cleaner environments, healthier living spaces, and vibrant cultural experiences. Vulcan Real Estate collaborates with local communities and cities to deliver lasting value [(Vulcan Real Estate)](https://vulcan.com/).\n\nIn addition to real estate, Vulcan Inc. has been involved in various business ventures and acquisitions, including a significant stake in Ticketmaster in 1993 and the purchase of the NFL's Seattle Seahawks in 1997. The company has also been active in technology ventures, such as Interval Research Corporation, which generated over 300 patents [(Nostalgia Nerd, 2025)](https://www.nostalgianerd.com/this-tiny-2k-computer-is-nuts/).\n\nVulcan Inc. is also known for its philanthropic efforts, particularly in wildlife conservation. The company has funded studies on elephant populations in Africa and advocated for stronger anti-poaching measures [(Sierra Club, 2023)](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2016-5-september-october/green-life/elephant-populations-decline-30-percent).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Jody Allen**: Following the death of her brother, Paul Allen, Jody Allen has taken on a significant role in overseeing Vulcan Inc.'s philanthropic initiatives and business ventures [(Gee, I Programmer, 2023)](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/82-heritage/17430-paul-allens-enigma-machine-under-the-hammer.html).\n\n# News\n\n## Philanthropic Initiatives\n\nVulcan Inc. has been actively involved in wildlife conservation, particularly in efforts to protect elephants in Africa. A comprehensive study funded by Vulcan revealed a 30% decline in savanna elephant populations across Africa between 2007 and 2014. Paul Allen emphasized the need for stronger anti-poaching measures and habitat protection [(Sierra Club, 2023)](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2016-5-september-october/green-life/elephant-populations-decline-30-percent).\n\n## Business Ventures and Acquisitions\n\nVulcan Inc. has a history of strategic acquisitions, including a significant stake in Ticketmaster in 1993 and the purchase of the NFL's Seattle Seahawks in 1997. The company has also been involved in various technology ventures, such as Interval Research Corporation, which generated over 300 patents [(Nostalgia Nerd, 2025)](https://www.nostalgianerd.com/this-tiny-2k-computer-is-nuts/).\n\n## Product Development: Vulcan FlipStart\n\nOne notable product developed by Vulcan Inc. is the Vulcan FlipStart, an ultra-mobile PC that was first showcased in 2004 and launched in 2007. The FlipStart aimed to provide a fully functional Windows XP experience in a handheld form factor. Despite its innovative design, the product struggled in the market due to timing and competition from smaller devices like smartphones [(Nostalgia Nerd, 2025)](https://www.nostalgianerd.com/this-tiny-2k-computer-is-nuts/).\n\n### Specifications and Features\n\nThe FlipStart was designed to be compact, measuring approximately 5.9 x 4.5 x 1.6 inches and weighing just under a pound. It featured a 5.6-inch display, a Transmeta Crusoe CPU, and a battery life of 2-6 hours. However, the actual product was slightly larger and heavier than initially planned, which affected its portability [(Nostalgia Nerd, 2025)](https://www.nostalgianerd.com/this-tiny-2k-computer-is-nuts/).\n\n### Market Reception\n\nUpon its release, the FlipStart was priced at $1,199 but saw a price reduction of $500 just six months later due to slow sales. By January 2008, the price had dropped to $699, and production ceased shortly thereafter. The product is now considered a collector's item, with some enthusiasts appreciating its unique design and capabilities [(Nostalgia Nerd, 2025)](https://www.nostalgianerd.com/this-tiny-2k-computer-is-nuts/).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nVulcan Inc. remains a significant player in both the business and philanthropic landscapes, driven by the legacy of its founder, Paul Allen. The company's commitment to conservation and innovative technology products like the FlipStart reflect its diverse interests and impact. As Vulcan continues to evolve under new leadership, its future initiatives will likely focus on addressing pressing global challenges while exploring new business opportunities.",

      "# Post ID 1apmpn4: sad that living computers: museum + labs is still closed but feeling a bit of hope! with +88 score by [(skyscapeparadise, Reddit, 2024-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1apmpn4/sad_that_living_computers_museum_labs_is_still/)\nWhen the Living Computers museum closed during the pandemic, several other Vale Group (formerly Vulcan Inc.) museums/public spaces closed as well including the Cinerama and the Flying Heritage Collection. It seemed as though none of these spaces would ever be open to the public again as the priorities of Vale Group appeared to be shifting away from these projects. However, given that both the Cinerama and the Flying Heritage Collection have been sold off to new owners who have reopened them, I'm hoping that Living Computers can meet this positive fate as well. I never had the opportunity to visit LCM+L since I had only recently moved to Washington at the time. Most people don't care about old computers but being someone who is really interested in history and technology, the thought of being able to try out a Xerox Alto or a PDP-11 or an Apple I seems incredible! It makes me sad that this one-of-a-kind resource has been in limbo, but my hope is that Vale is in the process of selling the museum to an owner who will give it the care and attention it deserves. I haven't given up the dream of being able to visit this museum!\n\n## Comment ID kq7dj58 with +22 score by [(aerothorn, Reddit, 2024-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1apmpn4/sad_that_living_computers_museum_labs_is_still/kq7dj58/) (in reply to ID 1apmpn4):\nIt's a fantastic museum, I am not holding my breath on it reopening but I hope with you.

Or how about Paul Allen canning Mora after just one season? \n\nI think if Paul Allen was running the show I do think things would look differently.\n\n## Comment ID if00rmh with +2 score by [(SPEK2120, Reddit, 2022-07-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/vs5fqn/why_do_people_dislike_jody_allen_so_much/if00rmh/) (in reply to ID vs5fqn):\nI feel like part of it's because no one who was put in charge of Paul's passion projects seem to give a shit about them/would rather have them gone and she's the easiest one to take it out on.

He wasn’t a football guy (more of a basketball fan) but he bought the Seahawks so they wouldn’t leave Seattle. He bought and kept open a lotta local little historical places like a computer museum and the cinerama. He also had a very hands on approach to the Seahawks where the community trusted his leadership. He definitely had points of conflict with the community, people either loved or hated his Seattle Commons idea to build a Central Park using the cities money but his land (people thought he should fund it himself and pointed out he was developing all the surrounding land) and his rich neighbors got annoyed the way he treated Lake Washington as his own personal pond (tho the stories are just funny to everyone else). However, ultimately Paul’s behavior made him someone people looked up to and that’s not the same for Jody. She’s been shutting down his program and has shown disinterest in properties like the Seahawks.

I'm heavily against it.\n\nI personally feel he has become overrated by this sub. One of the main reasons people want him is his defense, but Grant has been nothing more than an average defender since he left OKC. Major reason people love the idea of trading for him is that he is a good on-ball defender but throughout his career he's been average if not slightly below average.\n\nIn his time with the Pistons he hasn't really contributed to winning at all. **This season they are 12-21 without him, and 11-36 with him.** Last season they were 15-39 with him 5-13 without, had the exact same win %. This season the Pistons have a -7.9 with him, and a -7.0 without him. The Pistons over the last two seasons have a better win percentage without Jerami Grant.\n\nStatisically he hasn't been great either, he's put up **19.2 points, 2.4 assists, and 4.1 rebounds** (which is awful for a guy his size), and **2.0 turnovers** on a shit team. His shooting splits are 42.6/35.8/83.8, his **ts is 55.6%** which is slightly below league average. He puts up the best stats offensively with the ball in his hands hands, which is not a role we'd want him to be in, and it's not like he's a great playmaker to warrant making him a primary offensive option.\n\nOur very own Trendon Watford, the undrafted rookie has put up **15.3/6.3/3.4 and 1.9 to** **on 57.9 ts%** as a starter on a shit team. And I will agree with the argument that this is a small sample size.\n\nBut you can see the same thing with Josh Hart. **19.9/5.4/4.3 and 2.5 turnovers on 62.2 ts%,** with us.\n\nEven with Drew Eubanks **14.0/8.7/1.7 and 1.7 turnovers on 67.4 ts%.**\n\nThe main thing here, a lot of players can put up good stats on a shit team. Grant sample size is bigger but what sticks out to you about the way he's played that warrants sending a lotto and giving him a near max, other than the fact that he is a big name? \n\nI'm not trying to argue that Trendon is a better player than Jerami Grant, he’s not at all. But impact wise Grant has been close to the same as an **UNDRAFTED ROOKIE** when starting on a shitty team. A guy you get with a lottery pick is likely more talented than Trendon. So, why should I believe that it’s impossible for them to impact winning, when Grant himself hasn’t even impacted winning the past few seasons. And here’s the big thing Trendon is set to get about 1.5 for the next three seasons after this. Even Hart is only getting 12 mil the two seasons after this, and he is a similar caliber player as Grant. Grant gets 20 mil next season and is looking for a near max contract extension. \n\nWe just moved off Norm and got pretty shit value back. And a lot of people have attributed that to Norm being on a bad contract. Norm and Grant are the same age and are very similar caliber players. Norm will get on average 18 mil for the 4 seasons after this. We basically got back Keon for him. Grant gets 20 mil next season and then is a FA where he wants a 4/112. That’s a 26.4 mil average for the 5 seasons after this. So how is Norms contract such bad value that it only warrants getting back keon yet, Grant getting about 8 mil more and a year longer warrants a lotto pick?\n\nI'm fine with trading the Pels pick for a player, but Jerami Grant is not the guy to do that for. And so many keep on saying we should trade for a player with the pick and the name that they come up 90% of the time is Jerami Grant. Then when I've put up the argument saying we shouldn't get Grant a lot of people have told me we should trade it anyway because *young players can't impact winning*. Grant is ideally, a 3rd or 4th option and I just don't see that as worth a near max contract and a lottery pick. Rookie deals are the most valuable contracts in the league.\n \nRant/mini disseration over.\n\n### Comment ID i3slyt3 with +8 score by [(dannywacko, Reddit, 2022-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/tygk56/jerami_grants_career_defensive_metrics_via/i3slyt3/) (in reply to ID i3s6gb1):\nThe last two seasons he’s played for the pistons who have been tanking, it’s hard to say he doesn’t contribute to winning when the franchise is purposely looking to lose.\n\n#### Comment ID i3smj55 with +3 score by [(raahiv, Reddit, 2022-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/tygk56/jerami_grants_career_defensive_metrics_via/i3smj55/) (in reply to ID i3slyt3):\nThey’ve won more games this season without him than with him…\n\n### Comment ID i3tadj5 with +3 score by [(Tanman7211, Reddit, 2022-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/tygk56/jerami_grants_career_defensive_metrics_via/i3tadj5/) (in reply to ID i3s6gb1):\nI’m definitely getting RoCo vibes with Grant where people here talked themselves into believing a solid player is this star that’s going to make us a contender.\n\n#### Comment ID i3tcdxx with +8 score by [(raahiv, Reddit, 2022-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/tygk56/jerami_grants_career_defensive_metrics_via/i3tcdxx/) (in reply to ID i3tadj5):\nSame. I honestly liked the RoCo trade at the time but I look back at it now and I just think we would have been much better off with Saddiq Bey who we were basically guaranteed to get if he had kept our pick. Trading for Grant just feels like deja vu. Yes he’s a tier above RoCo as a player but you take into consideration his contract and looming extension on top of the fact that the pick we’d be giving up is better and it just seems like the same shit over again. I just feel like Grant’s impact is getting overrated and we’re gonna be 2 years down the line and he isn’t living up to expectations because they were much too high and now we’re in another Norm situation because we couldn’t just let him walk. And the guy that we could’ve got with the pick is just as impactful on an 8th of price. Cause that’s legit what happened with RoCo and Bey and it only took a season for it to play out like that.\n\n### Comment ID i3s8blm with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/tygk56/jerami_grants_career_defensive_metrics_via/i3s8blm/) (in reply to ID i3s6gb1):\nWatch people ignore this shit.\n\n### Comment ID i3t0kpz with +2 score by [(TheLetterOh, Reddit, 2022-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/tygk56/jerami_grants_career_defensive_metrics_via/i3t0kpz/) (in reply to ID i3s6gb1):\nI just wanted you to know that I've been pretty on the fence regarding Grant, but you totally swayed me.

However jerami would be the best wing defender this team has had since aminu while also being the best offensive option we’ve had since lamarcus aldridge. I think he could help this team a lot right away especially if we put him next to another defnsive wing in hart, nassir, or possibly our draft pick(praying for jabari). On offense we’d have 3 players capable of getting their own shot and can also fit into the offense. Tbh grant really helped that nuggets team in the bubble when they were making their 3-1 comebacks to have a run to the conference finals. When you add nurk to that and other good pieces off the bench I think we’ll be able to complete for a legit playoff spot, and at worst be in the 7-8th seed. Then atp we just have to continue to develop players and make some trades around the edges to build up our core, so that we could make deep runs in the playoffs. It’s not like we’ll be contenders next year regardless of if we have grant or a rookie, but there is definitely a path to contention with both options. We just need to make sure we don’t overpay for him, and at the end of the day this all hinges on whether or not Dame will stick this all the way through or not because I don’t see us realistically contending for another 2-3 years. Atp I think Dame could take on more of a cp3 role on the suns because i believe he’ll age just fine due to his shooting ability, work ethic, and improved playmaking\n\n## Comment ID i3u6z8j with +2 score by [(BrklynDragon, Reddit, 2022-04-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ripcity/comments/tygk56/jerami_grants_career_defensive_metrics_via/i3u6z8j/) (in reply to ID tygk56):\nDefensive metrics suck.

Problem now is that 1. Detroits been blatantly tanking for 2 seasons which it's hard to look impressive on a team like that and 2. He's playing beside a 2nd yr SF that's average at best on defense and a 2nd yr C that's barely 6'9  with practically No vertical and thus limited in his own defensive ability. Oh and let's not forget a rookie PG that is still growing out of rookie pains getting bated by veteran players to make Dumb defensive fouls. \n\nThat's the type of lineup Grant is playing within in a tanking season. Nobody's gonna look as good as they are when that's what they're surrounded by. \n\nThat's Grant's last 3 years and all things considered, he still looks much better than what yall are giving him credit for",
      "# Post ID j6y7pj: Comparing Lakers vs Celtics credentials as \"GOAT\" NBA franchise with +63 score by [(LarBrd33, Reddit, 2020-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/)\nBoston Celtics = 17 NBA championships\n\nLos Angeles Lakers = 12 NBA championships + 5 as the Minneapolis Lakers\n\nWe Celtic fans can continue to lean on this fact as a means of disputing LA's GOAT legitimacy.  Bill Simmons named a recent podcast after this fact.   \n\nBut if we're being honest...\n\n... and it pains me to admit this...\n\n2020, in addition to many other shitty things, marks the official dethroning of the Boston Celtics as the GOAT franchise.  \n\n* Over the past 34 years, we only have 1 NBA championship (2008).   This week will mark the Lakers 8th during that same timespan (1987, 1988, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009, 2010, 2020)\n\n* As Laker fans like to point out, only 4 of our NBA championships took place after the NBA/ABA merger in 1976. This will be the Lakers 11th.  Bulls (6 titles) and Spurs (5 titles) also lead us in post-merger championships.\n\n* The bulk of our championships (57, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66) happened when the league was 8-9 teams deep.  \n\n* Magic (5 titles) vs Bird (3 titles) was a victory for the Lakers.\n\n* Even our 1 championship in 2008 was eventually vanquished by the Lakers when they won back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010... essentially turning KG and the 08 Celtics into a Joe Frazier-esque footnote to Kobe's Muhammad Ali-esque championship legacy.\n\n* Lakers = 33 Finals appearances to Boston's 21\n\nIt sucks, but it is what it is.  The Lakers are the NBA's greatest franchise.  Must be nice to be in Los Angeles.  \n\nGotta hope that Tatum and his team can build a little dynasty here and start chipping away at the Laker league dominance.   It's been 12 years since our last championship.  Unclear if/when we'll be see ourselves back on top.\n\n## Comment ID g81hhm2 with +47 score by [(chickspeak, Reddit, 2020-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g81hhm2/) (in reply to ID j6y7pj):\nWe have the same number of championships with Dallas, Cleveland, Toronto, Detroit in the last 30 years.

Unless we draft another Pierce type of player (hoping JT is a Celtic lifer) and build a competent squad with assets and using those assets to trade for a superstar, its hard to see how teams like Boston with no geographical advantage can build a true championship squad for a 5 year window. \n\nLuckily for us Danny hit in the draft with Tatum and Brown.

Most NBA players (at least superstars) prefer a warm climate as they don't have to worry about little things like comfort with humidity or heat since they make a fuck ton of money. Cold is much more pervasive than heat. MLB players don't have to worry about it, the MLB season is spring-fall without the worst of winter. NFL players are out by the end of January and while they do have to go through winter, it isn't all of it. NHL players are a bit of a wild card- unlike NBA/NFL/MLB players, most NHL players are used to the cold being mostly Canadian, northern American, Scandinavian, or Russian. The weather isn't some horrific turn off for them like it is for a young NBA player.  \n\nNBA players are generally the ones that like to go out clubbing and partying more obviously at bare minimum than most MLB/NHL/NFL guys (how many other guys have jokes about them like Paul George and strippers, or Harden and strippers, or Kawhi and stri... you get the point, the biggest I can think of it NHL players can doing rails of coke in bar bathrooms- Bozak, Kadri, Hall are the biggies on that). Boston isn't a town built on the glitz, glamour, and nonstop partying like New York, LA, or Miami that appeals to stars with a thin veneer of gold covering a pile of failed ambitions. We are a town built on actually building shit that applies to real life in the sciences. It is a college town with the best colleges and universities in the country right up there with the best in the world. What is isn't, ZooMass excepted, is a party city- you don't have the crazy parties or clubs that New York, LA, or Miami have. If a college kid just wants to party, they go to ASU not to anywhere here. There is stuff to do absolutely, but most of it focuses on learning or history. LA has no history as a city, Miami has no history as a city, New York has some, but that isn't what you think of with New York. Boston, after colleges, medicine, and banking, has history as a big draw. That isn't an NBA thing- look at Leveon Bell who enjoys slapping ass at strip clubs and riding around jet ski's in Miami who had two places on his wishlist in FA- Miami and New York. Artemi Panarin went right to New York when he hit FA despite having a good team around him in Columbus because his girlfriend could find more work there are a model and they are known for enjoying nights out.\n\nTaxes are another reason- part of why Miami is able to get players there, look at the NHL and the discount deals that guys like Hedman, Stamkos, Kucherov, ect. took to stay in Tampa since they get far more there with no state tax than a player in Boston, Toronto, Montreal, ect.\n\nNBA players also hit FA a bit earlier than any other sport as most come in and play right away at 18/19 and can be a UFA by 25 with a 3 year rookie deal and 4 on a second contract, most MLB free agents don't hit the market until they are 29 or older, the best players are at minimum 26-27. The NHL is about the same, 26 being only for the guys like Tavares, most hit it in the 27-29 range. Look at David Pastrnak, 3 year rookie deal, then signed a 6 year deal as a RFA, no NBA player is gonna sign a 6 year deal- it is 4 with a player option for a 5th year likely that they will decline to make bank at 25. The NFL is a bit different- players can be UFA's by 26 in spite of playing football, but the big names the Pats have signed have been people ring chasing or using BB as a method to get a big contract somewhere else.\n\nThat doesn't sound like much, but the biggest thing I have noticed is players who have a family love Boston. Jarome Iginla played here one year and then moved here full time after retiring because he felt it gave his kids a great education and that was important to him. Guys like Theis, Hayward, IT,  Horford, ect.- the ones with family love Boston as a city. It has a ton of great qualities for a successful family. It doesn't have much to appeal to a young NBA player who likely wants to party, fuck, and enjoy the hell out of their personal life. We see a lot of older people from MA move to places like Florida or Arizona if they can afford it after their families have moved on into their own lives because once they aren't a family, the perks of Boston aren't as important anymore compared to a warmer, easier climate for their bodies. That goes full circle to NBA players without any attachments. \n\nTL;DR: New York, LA, and Miami are the business majors who are built, constantly partying, and having a good time- Boston is the nerdy, in decent shape but not built pre-med major who is focused on academia more than the college experience, NBA players are sorority girls on Tinder who don't give a shit about anything beyond the next 24 hours when they are swiping.\n\n#### Comment ID g83w370 with +4 score by [(pittiv20, Reddit, 2020-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g83w370/) (in reply to ID g83m0o4):\nThe actual answer is because there is legitimately nothing for a rich black man to do in Boston.

How many decent 2nd tier, like Artest? Meanwhile Boston just had the KG + Ray Allen and recently Kemba, Kyrie was traded here and him being a cancer he left, so I don't even count that as a good trade. The rest they had to draft. Even Clippers are more attractive to players, cause it's in LA.\n\nKnicks might be worth more, but LA is THE team in NBA, they have it easy like Real Madrid in Spain - they are funded by the crown of Spain. Other teams like Boston, Miami, OKC and Bucks are more impressive cause they had to build it on their own. And Laker fans still think they were fucked on the CP3 non-trade.

Blatant outright shameful tanking.\n\nBoston only really tried tanking for a season.  They just took Brooklyn to pound town and ended up with all their top picks for a few years.\n\n#### Comment ID g82fh9o with +1 score by [(horseshoeoverlook, Reddit, 2020-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g82fh9o/) (in reply to ID g82fe4c):\nAnd they actually traded their top picks for a top 5 guy\n\n### Comment ID g83vr70 with +1 score by [(Dondon1927, Reddit, 2020-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g83vr70/) (in reply to ID g82ejeh):\nThat's what happens when you're the Lakers.

They have a big market location that on its own lures stars, they have branding that on its own lures stars, and they have a history that lures stars because of this.\n\nThe Lakers will **never** be bad for long. For every shitty few years that the Lakers have, there's a LeBron or Shaq trying to play for them. They don't have to draft stars like most other teams because they can easily sign stars when they hit free agency.\n\nLet's say a neutral star free agent has two offers:\n\n- 4yrs/$120mil from the Celtics\n- 4yrs/$120mil from the Lakers\n\nThat free agent is choosing LA 9/10 times. It would take Knicks-level incompetence to reverse this fact. It's inevitable that the Lakers will get more championships than the Celtics at some point. The more people brush this off, the more disappointed they'll be when it happens. Did the deaths of Len Bias and Reggie Lewis accelerate this inevitability? Absolutely, but it's still an inevitability.\n\nThe Lakers will end up being the Yankees of the NBA over the next few decades because it's simply a lot more difficult for the Lakers to be consistently bad than consistently good.\n\nThe best the Celtics can do is try to be the sharpest thorn in their side possible.\n\n### Comment ID g85d72y with +3 score by [(Hungry4Banner18, Reddit, 2020-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g85d72y/) (in reply to ID g82rkvb):\nBoth Lakers and Celtics had enough cap space to sign Durant but at the very least KD gave us an meeting and he didn’t even dare contact LA.\n\n### Comment ID g83885m with +1 score by [(macklowe, Reddit, 2020-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g83885m/) (in reply to ID g82rkvb):\nI think Brooklyn are more apt to be the Yankees actually - the Spurs in a 20x bigger market.\n\nAlso they share the same cable network.\n\n#### Comment ID g83luh8 with +1 score by [(yeliandbeli, Reddit, 2020-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g83luh8/) (in reply to ID g83885m):\nLol no.

I don't understand why people are just shaming Jodie, sexism maybe?!\n\n## Comment ID i0hehrl with +155 score by [(MountTuchanka, Reddit, 2022-03-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/td5cgz/exbodyguards_accuse_jody_allen_of_sexual/i0hehrl/) (in reply to ID td5cgz):\n> Besides allegations of sexual harassment, court documents allege Jody Allen tried to sneak home giraffe bones while on safari in Botswana\n\nIm speechless\n\n### Comment ID i0hle0m with +54 score by [(yrulaughing, Reddit, 2022-03-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/td5cgz/exbodyguards_accuse_jody_allen_of_sexual/i0hle0m/) (in reply to ID i0hehrl):\nWait what?

Cool. So as long as your are productive than, you can hit whomever you want if you are a Chief.

I don’t want him on my team because my fandom is a personal investment of time and money into the product on the field. I don’t really care about the teams ownership group. I don’t think about them.

I don’t want to deal with other fanbases bringing him up. I don’t really want to talk about him at all. \n\nThe owner of the team never got that energy from me. So the fact that jodie Allen sucks is of the same interest level to me as the thousands of other shitty people slightly adjacent to my life.\n\n## Comment ID i0icwez with +1 score by [(Capnjack84, Reddit, 2022-03-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/td5cgz/exbodyguards_accuse_jody_allen_of_sexual/i0icwez/) (in reply to ID td5cgz):\nRich people are fucking weird. “Oh security….please grab my suitcase full of coke, weed, giraffe bones and oh yea don’t forget the one with penguin skulls.”\n\n## Comment ID i0ico2a with +1 score by [(Capnjack84, Reddit, 2022-03-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/td5cgz/exbodyguards_accuse_jody_allen_of_sexual/i0ico2a/) (in reply to ID td5cgz):\nLink to Seattle PI article.

They do love the Blazers and Timbers, and sport is huge in the state in general.\n\nThe Portland metro area is probably large and wealthy enough. I feel like NHL hockey would have appeal as something new and different, which kind of fits with the eclectic attitude of the city, and the a lot of the state for that matter. \n\nThe biggest unknown is if there's enough interest to go around between the Blazers and the NHL. I just never knew anyone, friends, or co-workers, that had ever even given hockey a single thought. It would be a pretty raw market to develop fans in—similar to Vegas imo.

The Portland metropolitan area has a population of around 2.45 million, and out of the 50 biggest metro areas in the United States it is ranked 15th in population growth. That gives it a bigger population than the metro areas supporting the Jets, Sabres, Hurricanes, Oilers, Senators, Flames, Predators, Blue Jackets, Golden Knights, and Penguins.\n\nPortland is certainly big enough to support a team, the question is if it would do so. Atlanta is the 10th largest metropolitan area in the United States and Canada, with a metro population of 5.79 million, yet the NHL failed to keep a team in Atlanta *twice* (the Flames were there from 1972 to 1980, and the Thrashers were there from 1999 to 2011). \n\nCould it?

We've seen via Vegas how tremendously well an expansion/relocation can do even outside a \"traditional hockey market\" with the right plan.  But none of that is guaranteed.

This makes people dislike the idea more knowing that much money is going somewhere else, and the council doesn't want a new arena built (the mayor has vowed to  build as much \"affordable housing\" as he can).  All that said, the city council and mayor have all stated they are not going to okay a new team anytime soon.",

Welfare programs exist, and are intended to help address poverty. They have limited funds. Every dollar wasted on fraud is a dollar not making its way towards combatting poverty. This means there's a need for better fraud detection software tailored to the needs of welfare programs.\n\nWant to help save the environment? Pick an environmental problem, and help scientists working on it write code to model the issue, or identify problems spots. Help them apply ML techniques to build decision engines and predictive models and such. There's *loads* of possible work here, it just pays like shit compared to building a CRUD app for an insurance company or whatever.\n\nI think the reason you take such a pessimistic view is that you view this only from the \"big picture\" perspective. Obviously no one software program is going to solve the whole climate change problem. But specific environmental problems certainly can make use of better software to solve them far more directly than just writing some web app to help people sign up for a mailing list. There's a vast world of difference between tackling coding problems that help people solve real problems in real life... and trying to change the world with the internet.\n\nEach of these huge problems is made up of innumerable small problems--and those small problems are often problems directly addressable by software.\n\n#### Comment ID dwbjyii with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-03-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dwbjyii/) (in reply to ID dwbf8fy):\nOn one hand, yes--I most definitely have a pessimistic view due to the big picture perspective... but how is looking at the totality of the problem not the way to solve it? What matter is it, anyway, if your software can detect fraud when the organizations running these welfare programs don't have the budget to run and maintain it, or if the fraud-doers are backed by corrupt politicians whose contrivances are vast and pockets deep such that anything recorded by the software is easily nullified by bribery? What matter is it if your software can help scientists model natural phenomena and better understand the data, when solving climate change is against the business interests of oligarchs and politicians who, together, can ensure that none of your recommendations are written and enacted into policy and that you will systematically find it difficult to get research funding?\n\nAgain, tools. Software is not going to directly address these problems at large; policy and the implementation thereof by state officials, really, are the direct solutions. Or maybe being a billionaire like Elon Musk--but even his solutions to the most challenging problems of our species which states all over the world are deliberately ignoring aren't software products by themselves. But software is, definitely, one of his tools.\n\n## Comment ID dw97xz5 with +379 score by [(thomas30486, Reddit, 2018-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dw97xz5/) (in reply to ID 87013t):\nI know it's probably not what you were looking for but one of the most effective things you can do is work at a company that isn't detrimental to the world and donate a portion of your income to the relevant charity.

They do precious research on ocean acidity, they map glaciers and ice melting rates, they conduct satellite imagery using GIS.  \nThey're one of the most important branches of government for climate change and they have 33 fucking job openings and maybe a third of them are engineering.  \nAnd good luck getting even an interview for it.

Only about 30-50 make it to the interview phase.  \nI was cut out from the first round and I had heard I was competing against PhD graduates with over 2 years of experience directly related to the field.

Groups working in niche fields built up capabilities only to have their efforts redirected by whoever the latest manager was who had no domain expertise. Managers were brought in based on their credentials at the biggest tech companies but the strategies they learned there were inappropriate to the size, scope, and audience of Vulcan projects.  Imagine a 2 person 6 month research project. Now bring in 3 managers who insist on making the prototype 'enterprise grade', halting progress. Be sure to berate the engineers on their way out. Projects managers focus more on reporting progress than progressing. I've never been at an organization which spends the amount of effort this one does to tell employees how great it is to work there. I wish I left sooner.",

Senior management will do anything to keep their well-paying jobs: they repeatedly move/alter project goals/direction and blame their employees when projects don't go as planned. Self-preservation at Vulcan is senior management's primary goal.  A series of poor hires at the C-suite level have sent the company reeling.

          "cons": "I’m also very happy to have left. Vulcan lacks paying customers. Without that simple but powerful force, it is hard to keep a company pointed toward true north.\r\n\r\nIn my five years in the tech department, it had about three name changes and 4-6 leadership changes. With each regime change I would feel a new sense of hope. “This guy (note: always a guy) seems like he understands business. He’s not just interested in creating a wacky invention, but he wants to make products for actual human beings.” Inevitably, users would fall to the wayside and we would ultimately build something for a white guy sitting in an ivory tower. While Mr. Allen had good intentions and creative ideas, he often wanted a cutting edge engineering solution to a big humanitarian problem. The non-engineering solutions were too dull. But the engineering solutions were often out of touch.\r\n\r\nOne thing was consistent: the worker bees were passionate about making something amazing and functional. Similar to Mr. Allen, they wanted to make a big impact in people’s’ lives. They researched ways to make science fiction come to life. They are smart, kind, creative, sharing people. However, the people who get promoted spout empty promises. They strut in like Donald Trump, fabricating business models and customer needs.\r\n\r\nIn some ways, it's hard to fault these leaders. When there is no business, then lying with flourish is the best way to personally survive. If they can’t be successful by making a sale, then success has to come from a bloated sense of self worth.\r\n\r\nIn the last regime change, things have gone slightly differently. The customer we designed for was no longer Paul Allen but instead a nonexistent customer who wants futuristic products at a reasonable price. In trying to productize Paul’s ideas, they are taking something developed in a lab and trying to make it a commodity, underfunding any R&amp;D that would maintain differentiation.\r\n\r\nLeadership isn’t taking a strong stance in any direction:\r\n- If it truly wanted to build products, it would expand the team size to function comparably to a competitor. Right now, teams of 2-10 people are trying to create a full scale business.\r\n- If it wanted to operate as a tech transfer office, it would partner with major companies. Instead, it keeps its tech development under wraps.\r\n- If it wanted to be a Google X, it would focus on R&amp;D and build truly futuristic product prototypes and not worry about making a sale.\r\n\r\nVulcan doesn’t know what it is. It never has. It always sat in a technological purgatory, partially because I don’t think Mr. Allen cared enough to commercialize. Without Paul Allen, it loses a leader that had a sci-fi imagination. That might be a good thing since his ideas never touched the ground. It might be a bad thing because there are no longer any ideas.\r\n\r\nRight now, it is trying to commoditize futuristic ideas for an imaginary customer. Best of luck.",

Without that simple but powerful force, it is hard to keep a company pointed toward true north.\r\n\r\nIn my five years in the tech department, it had about three name changes and 4-6 leadership changes. With each regime change I would feel a new sense of hope. “This guy (note: always a guy) seems like he understands business. He’s not just interested in creating a wacky invention, but he wants to make products for actual human beings.” Inevitably, users would fall to the wayside and we would ultimately build something for a white guy sitting in an ivory tower. While Mr. Allen had good intentions and creative ideas, he often wanted a cutting edge engineering solution to a big humanitarian problem. The non-engineering solutions were too dull. But the engineering solutions were often out of touch.\r\n\r\nOne thing was consistent: the worker bees were passionate about making something amazing and functional. Similar to Mr. Allen, they wanted to make a big impact in people’s’ lives. They researched ways to make science fiction come to life. They are smart, kind, creative, sharing people. However, the people who get promoted spout empty promises. They strut in like Donald Trump, fabricating business models and customer needs.\r\n\r\nIn some ways, it's hard to fault these leaders. When there is no business, then lying with flourish is the best way to personally survive. If they can’t be successful by making a sale, then success has to come from a bloated sense of self worth.\r\n\r\nIn the last regime change, things have gone slightly differently. The customer we designed for was no longer Paul Allen but instead a nonexistent customer who wants futuristic products at a reasonable price. In trying to productize Paul’s ideas, they are taking something developed in a lab and trying to make it a commodity, underfunding any R&amp;D that would maintain differentiation.\r\n\r\nLeadership isn’t taking a strong stance in any direction:\r\n- If it truly wanted to build products, it would expand the team size to function comparably to a competitor. Right now, teams of 2-10 people are trying to create a full scale business.\r\n- If it wanted to operate as a tech transfer office, it would partner with major companies. Instead, it keeps its tech development under wraps.\r\n- If it wanted to be a Google X, it would focus on R&amp;D and build truly futuristic product prototypes and not worry about making a sale.\r\n\r\nVulcan doesn’t know what it is. It never has. It always sat in a technological purgatory, partially because I don’t think Mr. Allen cared enough to commercialize. Without Paul Allen, it loses a leader that had a sci-fi imagination. That might be a good thing since his ideas never touched the ground. It might be a bad thing because there are no longer any ideas.\r\n\r\nRight now, it is trying to commoditize futuristic ideas for an imaginary customer. Best of luck.",

It was great for my career to dabble in cutting edge technology. It makes people notice my resume. It forced me to think outside the box. I am grateful for my time at Vulcan.",

      "# [Akagi 赤城: NOAA Ocean Exploration by US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic, Atmospheric Administration](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/news/exploration-extras/photogrammetry/akagi/akagi.html)\nBackground\n\nAkagi 赤城 was a Japanese aircraft carrier that was in service from 1927 to 1942. It was originally designed as an Amagi-Class battlecruiser, but construction as such was not finished due to the 1922 signing of the Washington Naval Treaty. In 1927, the incomplete hull of Akagi was repurposed and used to build a larger and faster aircraft carrier.\n\nAkagi had an overall length of 261 meters, a beam of 31 meters, a draft of 8 meters, a maximum speed of 31.5 knots, and a range of 12,000 miles at 16 knots. It had a complement of 1,630 personnel and 88 aircraft.",
      "# [Tonga Environment Data Portal](https://tonga-data.sprep.org/index.php/search?f%5B0%5D=content_type%3Aannouncements&f%5B1%5D=content_type%3Adataset&f%5B2%5D=content_type%3Adata%20story&page=9)\nThis dataset shows the global distribution of seamounts and knolls identified using global bathymetric data at 30 arc-sec resolution. A total of 33,452 seamounts and 138,412 knolls were identified, representing the largest global set of identified seamounts and knolls to date. Seamount habitat was found to constitute approximately 4.7% of the ocean floor, whilst knolls covered 16.3%.\n\nThe research leading to these results received funding from the European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme, and from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\nConservation International, GRID-Arendal and Geoscience Australia recently collaborated to produce a map of the global distribution of seafloor geomorphic features. The global seafloor geomorphic features map represents an important contribution towards the understanding of the distribution of blue habitats. Certain geomorphic feature are known to be good surrogates for biodiversity. For example, seamounts support a different suite of species to abyssal plains.\n\nGEBCO's aim is to provide the most authoritative publicly-available bathymetry of the world's oceans. It operates under the joint auspices of the International Hydrographic Organization(IHO) and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) (of UNESCO).\n\nGEBCO produces and makes available a range of bathymetric data sets and products. This includes a global bathymetric grid; gazetteer of undersea feature names, a Web Map Service and printable maps of ocean bathymetry.\n\nBio-ORACLE is a set of GIS rasters providing geophysical, biotic and environmental data for surface and benthic marine realms. The data are available for global-scale applications at a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin (approximately 9.2 km at the equator).\n\nLinking biodiversity occurrence data to the physical and biotic environment provides a framework to formulate hypotheses about the ecological processes governing spatial and temporal patterns in biodiversity, which can be useful for marine ecosystem management and conservation.\n\nThe Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4): Population Density, Revision 11 consists of estimates of human population density (number of persons per square kilometer) based on counts consistent with national censuses and population registers, for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. A proportional allocation gridding algorithm, utilizing approximately 13.5 million national and sub-national administrative units, was used to assign population counts to 30 arc-second grid cells.\n\nMinerals are non-renewable resources (at least within human timeframes) but mining them is now apparently a sustainable enterprise, not a one-way street of exploitation. ISA provides an international and transparent forum to regulate and manage all mineral resources related activities and ensure protection of the marine environment in the “Area”, the deep seabed and subsoil beyond national jurisdiction, for the benefit of all humanity.\n\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) is a free, editable map & spatial database of the whole world. This dataset is an extract of OpenStreetMap data for 21 Pacific Island Countries, in a GIS-friendly format. The OSM data has been split into separate layers based on themes (buildings, roads, points of interest, etc), and it comes bundled with a QGIS project and styles, to help you get started with using the data in your maps.\n\nThe Khaled bin Sultan Living Oceans Foundation has completed the World Reef Map, an online interactive coral reef atlas that allows users to explore all of the coral reefs and shallow water marine habitats mapped on the Global Reef Expedition. With over 65,000 square kilometers of shallow water marine ecosystems mapped, this is by far the largest collection of high-resolution coral reef maps ever made.\n\nMap layers include Benthic Habitat Data, Bathymetry, Depth Contours and Habitat Videos.\n\nThe Khaled bin Sultan Living Oceans Foundation completed field research for one of the largest coral reef studies in history: the Global Reef Expedition. The Expedition travelled around the globe surveying some of the most remote reefs on the planet, conducting research to assess coral reef ecosystem health and resiliency.\n\nThe Global Reef Expedition visited many countries in the Pacific Ocean to assess the health and resiliency of their coral reef ecosystems. See links below for more information, reports and maps.\n\nThe World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is the most comprehensive global database of marine and terrestrial protected areas, updated on a monthly basis, and is one of the key global biodiversity data sets being widely used by scientists, businesses, governments, International secretariats and others to inform planning, policy decisions and management. The WDPA is a joint project between UN Environment and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\nThis project has developed sub-regional bioregionalisations for the western-south Pacific Ocean, through expert workshops and novel statistical analysis of physical and biological data. This combines approaches CSIRO developed in Australia, used in the Bay of Bengal (in collaboration with BOBLME) with similar approaches that have been used throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans to derive a single combined bioregionalisation.",

      "# [Paul Allen's Historic Computers Under the Hammer by Sue Gee](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/82-heritage/17430-paul-allens-enigma-machine-under-the-hammer.html)\nDozens of rare historic computers are currently up for auction. As well as a room-sized PDP 7, there's an Altair, an Apple I, a Cray I and an Enigma machine on offer to the highest bidder as the private collection of the late Paul Allen, is sold by Christies, New York.\n\nAs well as being co-founder of Microsoft with Bill Gates, the duo responsible for bringing BASIC to the home computer, specifically the Altair 8800, Paul Allen was an avid collector. During his lifetime he had amassed not only historic computers and notable technology, but also artworks and precious artefacts of all kinds.\n\nAllen was also a philanthropist who supported the arts, music, sport, science and technology. After resigning from Microsoft in 1983, he set up Vulcan Inc. in 1986 as an investment and project management firm with his sister, Jody Allen and two years later established the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation to oversee his philanthropic venture. Now, nearly six years after his death in October 2018, from complications of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a disease he was first diagnosed with in 1982, items from his private collection are being sold to further his philanthropic mission.\n\nIn fact the number of items is so large, so varied and so valuable that Christies has split them across three sales. The collective title for the sales is \"Gen One: Innovations from the Paul G. Allen Collection\" and expectations are high given that in 2022 a previous auction titled \"Visionary: The Paul G. Allen Collection\" and comprising 155 art masterpieces achieved $1.62 billion, becoming the most valuable private collection ever to come to auction. The artworks now going on sale are in one of the two online auctions that started on August 23rd and finishes on September 12th. As it's title, \"Over the Horizon: Art of the Future from the Paul G. Allen Collection\" suggest, works in the 57 lots are devoted to how the future, especially interplanetary travel, was imagined by artists and other thinkers during the 20th century including Chesley Bonestell, Robert McCall, R.C. Swanson, George Gibbs, and Fred Freeman. According to Christies:\n\nThe artworks in this auction, along with their publication in popular magazines, inspired a generation of explorers, scientists, and aerospace engineers.\n\nThe concurrent online auction is Firsts: The History of Computing from the Paul G. Allen Collection which Christies claim:\n\npresents important milestones in the history of computing, some of which have been preserved in working order\n\nThe 58 lots in this sale comprises the bulk of the contents of the Living Computers, the Seattle-based museum, which Paul Allen founded in 2012 to display his growing collection of historic computers and have them restored to working order and maintained by a team of engineers. In this video posted by Christies, Stephen Jones, Senior Restoration & Collection Manager, Living Computers sets the scene and introduces some of the historic computers that he used to be responsible for, presenting a timeline that highlights the breakthroughs in technology that the machines represent.\n\nAs reported in Paul Allen's Living Computer Museum Going, Going, Gone Living Computers had been forced to close to the public by the pandemic 2020. It never re-opened much to the disappointment of those who appreciated Paul Allen's aim of preserving vintage and heritage computers for posterity. One aficionado, Seattle-area tech veteran, Paolo Tosolini, founder of Tosolini Productions, had done a high-tech 3D photo scans of Living Computers and later created a more detailed scan of the first and second floors. Now, using technology from the 3D-capture platform Matterport, interactive “hot spots” have been added to 16 items that are up for auction, including the PDP 7 and the Apple 1 with links to lot details at Chrisitie's.\n\nClick on image to go to the Virtual Tour of LCM and see how Paul Allen's collection told the history of computing.\n\nWhile the online auction a mix of huge and small items, from the PDP 7 to mercury delay line memory from the Remington Rand Univac, the gems of the LMC collection are included in the \"live auction, \"Pushing Boundaries: Ingenuity from the Paul G. Allen Collection, taking place at Christies Rockefeller Center galleries in New York on September with viewing open from September 6-9. It comprises 36 lots, including Einstein’s letter to President Roosevelt which propelled the US into the nuclear age and crucial artifacts from the Space Race, including astronaut Ed White’s spacesuit cover layer, the pilot’s in-flight logbook from Apollo 8, and an annotated checklist from the first American spacewalk in June 1965.\n\nThe historic computers included in the sale all have important stories. The MITS Altair 8800 is as Christie's state:\n\nThe first commercially successful personal computer, which catalysed the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s.\n\nMore importantly for Paul Allen it was the machine for which he and Bill Gates, when they were 22 and 20 years old respectively, created a BASIC interpreter, to know more about this and how it led to the formation of Microsoft, see articles in our History section.\n\nWhile Apple Is are rare, the one included in the sale, with an estimate of $500,000-800,00 is unique. Around 200 units were originally produced and one of these was retained by the company probably to be used a as demo unit. As explained in the lot details this machine was removed from its place in Jobs’ office in 1985 by Don Hutmacher after Steve Jobs was dismissed from Apple and engineers were allowed to take items from his office. Hutchmacher's Apple security pass is included in the lot.\n\nBy way of Apple I memorabilia, the auction also includes a lot comprising two typed letters, the first of which dated 5 November 1976, is signed twice by Steve Jobs and has apologetic annotation in his handwriting. Its estimate is $50,000–80,000.\n\nThere's also an Enigma Machine. We've covered the auction of several of these over the years, seeing them realize from $100,000 upwards. This one is a four-rotor model, manufactured by Heimsoeth & Rinke in 1941 and has an estimate of $250,000-350,000.\n\nAnother lot that caught my eye is an IBM 360/91 console, which according to Chrisitie's:\n\nstands as a testament to the advanced technology of its era, representing the height of the System/360 line and offering a rare glimpse into the computing innovations of the 1960s.\n\nHaving been owned by Princeton University and exhibited by Walt Disney Picture in Tomorrowland in 2015, this example was restored at Living Computers. Having had new circuitry added, the console:\n\nnow includes an animated display demonstrating its operation, complete with a playful light show currently programmed where Pac-Man chases a ghost, adding a touch of modern whimsy to its historical significance.\n\nMoving forward a decade there is a Cray-1 Supercomputer. Only around 80 units were ever built and this one, Serial Number 12 was purchased in 1981 by the University of Minnesota and was designed to match UMN colors. After being decommissioned it was used as a sales model for Cray Research Inc. Only 17 Cray-1s are thought to survive and this is the first to come to auction with an estimate of USD 150,000 – USD 250,000.\n\nThere's a decommissioned Cray-2 in the online auction with an estimate of USD 150,000 – USD 250,000, but as yet no bid has yet been placed. One does have to wonder who has deep enough pockets and sufficient spare room to afford to win such an item. Although the computers are indeed important milestones in the history of computing they can also be seen as white elephants - expensive to maintain and a big responsibility due to their rarity.\n\nAs Stephen Jones points out in the video Living Computers was:\n\n\"a grand collection of restored machines, some of the most important milestones in the history of computing\"\n\nwhich Paul Allen had put together to inspire the next generation of technologists. Even though all the proceeds of the sales are destined for charitable causes, the idea that this collection is being dispersed, with much of it disappearing from public view, comes as a great disappointment to people, including those who had donated their computers to preserve them for posterity and to make them accessible to future generations.\n\nMore Information\n\nGen One: Innovations from the Paul G.

      "# [Wikipedia by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2003-06-17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechTV)\nCable channel\n\nTelevision channel\n\nTechTV was a 24-hour cable and satellite channel based in San Francisco featuring news and shows about computers, technology, and the Internet. In 2004, it merged with the G4 gaming channel which ultimately dissolved TechTV programming. At the height of its six-year run, TechTV was broadcast in 70 countries, reached 43 million households, and claimed 1.9 million unique visitors monthly to its website.[1] A focus on personality-driven product reviews and technical support made it a cultural hub for technology information worldwide, still existing today online through its former hosts' webcasts, most notably the TWiT Network.\n\nThe offices were located at 650 Townsend Street, 94103,[2] and the studios, of which there were two, were located at 535 York Street, 94110.[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nOrigins\n\n[edit]\n\nOn August 20, 1994, computer magazine publisher Ziff Davis entered the television industry with the premiere of The Personal Computing Show, a program that aired on Saturday mornings on CNBC, America's Talking and the Jones Computing Network. The Personal Computing Show, co-hosted by Jim Louderback and Gina Smith, targeted a growing demographic of personal computer owners and demonstrated how to purchase, install, maintain and repair personal computers and peripheral devices such as printers. Shortly after The Personal Computing Show's premiere, Ziff Davis revealed plans to produce a second show in October 1994 named PC Update, a half-hour Sunday morning news program hosted by Leo Laporte and focusing on the computer industry.[4][5] According to Ziff Davis spokesman Gregory Jarboe, The Personal Computing Show was unsuccessful due to its relegation to odd channels and timeslots.[6] When Ziff Davis' sale to investment firm Forstmann Little & Company was announced in October 1994, a small Foster City-based television operation named \"ZD-TV\" was listed as a company asset.[7]\n\nIn April 1996, Ziff Davis announced the establishment of ZDTV as a San Francisco-based unit specializing in the production of television and internet broadcasts, which would allow the publisher to showcase its products. Its first project was to develop The Site, a daily hour-long prime time news show co-hosted by Soledad O'Brien about the increasing social and economic effects of technology. The program aired on the cable news network MSNBC, which launched on July 15, 1996.[8][9] It was the third San Francisco-based television program specializing in technology after CNET Central and Cyberlife.[10] According to Ziff Davis chief executive Larry Wangberg,[6] San Francisco was chosen as ZDTV's headquarters for its proximity to Silicon Valley and easy access to Multimedia Gulch-based talent.[11]\n\nOn May 6, 1997, Ziff Davis announced its plan to launch ZDTV as a 24-hour interactive cable network specializing in computers and the Internet. The publisher put $100 million behind the project and planned to debut the ZDTV channel in early 1998. Projected programming for the channel included talk shows on the impact of technology, business-oriented shows evaluating investments in high-tech stocks, and reviews of software and hardware.[12] Children's programming was also planned for the weekends.[13] The channel had 11 initial charter advertisers, including IBM, Gateway 2000, Microsoft, and Charles Schwab.[12] Ziff Davis chairman and CEO Eric Hippeau cited the increasing presence of computers in cable television homes and workspaces as motivation for filling the niche of programming about computers, saying \"This is a huge audience and it will only get bigger\".[13] Wangberg, who would be made the network's CEO, proclaimed Ziff Davis' ambition of ZDTV becoming \"to computing what CNN is to news, what ESPN is to sports\".[11] Although Ziff Davis intended to continue producing The Site for MSNBC following ZDTV's launch,[14] the show was canceled in September 1997 as a result of the network's shift toward an all-news format.[6][15] In December 1997, Ziff Davis revealed at the Western Cable Trade Show in Anaheim that it had secured agreements with four cable operators to carry the network: Prime Cable in Las Vegas, Harron Communications in Detroit, Televue in Georgia, and Prestige Cable in Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland.[6]\n\nZDTV\n\n[edit]\n\nZDTV was initially set to launch at the end of 1998's first quarter, but was delayed by Ziff Davis' initial public offering, which was announced on February 18.[11] The network launched on Monday May 11, 1998, on cable systems in Las Vegas, Detroit, parts of Georgia near Atlanta and parts of Maine.[16] On August 1, 1998, ZDTV was broadcast in its native San Francisco when the channel struck a deal with DirecTV to become available on Channel 273 via the providers' satellite dishes.[17] In November 1998, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's holding company Vulcan Ventures invested $54 million in ZDTV, granting it a 33 percent stake in the network.[18]\n\nAlthough ZDTV was critically acclaimed, it struggled to gain a foothold in AT&T/TCI cable lineups,[19] and was deemed unprofitable. In an effort to sell company assets to reduce debt and boost its share price,[20] Ziff Davis put ZDTV up for sale on July 16, 1999. In November 1999, Vulcan purchased the remaining two-thirds in a transaction that was completed on January 21, 2000. The deal (which permitted the network to retain its name) was worth $204.8 million.[19][21] On August 21, 2000, ZDTV announced that it would be changing its name to TechTV the following month, and would simultaneously be added to AT&T and Time Warner Cable's digital cable lineups.[22][23]\n\nTechTV\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 15, 2001, TechTV announced that it had laid off an approximate of a dozen employees as part of a reorganization effort in the face of the waning dot-com bubble.[24] On April 2, the nine-hour live programming block Tech Live, which the network described as the \"nucleus of TechTV's daytime programming\", was launched.[25]\n\nOn November 16, TechTV announced another layoff of 130 employees. This, combined with the reduction of Tech Live and indifferent online reactions to TechTV's struggles, were interpreted by Wired News' Farhad Manjoo as a sign of declining cultural interest in technology. Anonymous TechTV employees remarked that the increasingly ubiquitous nature of the Internet had rendered the network's mission statement \"a bit fantastical\", and suggested that the only reason the network was still in business was because \"Allen doesn't know what to do with his billions\".[26] In the spring of 2002, TechLive was cut further into just one thirty-minute daily news magazine show, with a focus less on tech news and more on technology's cultural aspect.[27] In 2002, Silicon Spin (an opinion forum hosted by PC Magazine editor John C. Dvorak from the original ZDTV launched in May 1998) and AudioFile (a show for digital music enthusiasts launched in August 2000) were canceled, with its hosts being absorbed onto other network programs. 2003 saw the introduction of several new shows (such as Performance, Robot Wars, and Unscrewed with Martin Sargent).\n\nTechTV was also broadcast over the air on KTQW in Wichita, Kansas until the TechTV name was dropped during the G4 merger.[28]\n\nInternational distribution\n\n[edit]\n\nA Canadian version of TechTV launched on September 7, 2001, as a joint venture of TechTV, Rogers Media, and Shaw Communications. The channel would later become G4techTV Canada to coincide with the American merger of TechTV and G4. The channel would change its name once again in mid-2009 to G4 Canada. In 2004, TechTV launched on Foxtel Digital in Australia. After the merger with G4, TechTV (then called G4techTV) left Australia lineups as its international feed ceased. On Malaysia's ASTRO platform, repeats of the international feed was run for some time after the international feed ceased before starting to import G4TV programming and retransmitting them locally on the same channel as the public educational service TV Pendidikan from 2002 to 2006. In Japan, Sony's So-net channel aired several TechTV programs until the fall of 2005 (they aired reruns after May 2004). In New Zealand, TechTV aired on Saturn Communications's channel 34 until May 2004. In addition to those countries, TechTV was broadcast internationally in the United Kingdom.\n\nMerger and consolidation\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 25, 2004, Comcast's G4 gaming channel announced a merger with TechTV. This move became hugely controversial among loyal fans of TechTV and Leo Laporte, who, because of a contract dispute with Vulcan, left the channel. Shows with Laporte, including The Screen Savers and Call for Help, continued on with remaining staff taking over his hosting duties.\n\nAround May 6, 2004, G4 announced the termination of 250 employees from the San Francisco office by July 16, 2004, allowing approximately 80 to 100 employees to transition to G4's main office in Los Angeles if they agreed to relocate there.[29] Shows from TechTV that were not redundant to G4's offerings continued on until July, when the closing of the TechTV Offices would close the respective stages for these shows in turn.\n\nOn May 10, 2004, G4 Media completed the acquisition of TechTV from Vulcan. G4techTV was launched in the U.S. on May 28, 2004. This led to the cancellation of many of the TechTV channels throughout carriers across the world (e.g.: systems with both channels active, systems limiting Comcast's number of channels on their lineup, etc.) On January 3, 2005, TechTV International began airing select programs from G4techTV. After the closure deadline passed on July 16, 2004, only Los Angeles produced shows would air on the new channel. The final production originating at TechTV in San Francisco was the September 2, 2004, episode of The Screen Savers (which was taped on July 16, 2004).\n\nOn February 15, 2005, the TechTV brand was dropped from the United States G4techTV feed, leaving the network name as G4 – Video Game Television which also echoed the changes in programming made to the channel due to the merger for both G4's original offering and the greatly diminished TechTV originated shows; after that, G4 went through a rebranding and changed most of its programming to position itself as a male-oriented network.\n\nPrograms\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following is a partial list of programs aired by TechTV.\n\nOriginal programming\n\n[edit]\n\nAudioFile – a weekly program focusing on technology's increasing role in the music industry.[30]\n\nBig Thinkers – a weekly interactive program that conducts interviews with the technology industry's visionaries.[30][31][32][33]\n\nCall for Help – a prime-time interactive program in which viewers can call, email or netcam for assistance in solving computer problems.[30][31][32][33]\n\nComputer Shopper – a weekly program that provides information about computer hardware and software products and how to buy them intelligently.[31]\n\nCyberCrime – a weekly program that investigates dangers to computer users such as fraud, hacking, viruses, cybersex crimes, and invasions of privacy.[30][32][33][34]\n\nDigital Avenue – a prime-time program in which manufacturers present in-depth demonstrations of their latest products.[31]\n\nEye Drops – a weekly showcase of computer-animated shorts.[35]\n\nFresh Gear – a weekly program that reviews technological gadgets.[30][31][32][33]\n\nInternet Tonight – a prime-time program showcasing people and personalities who specialize in the Internet.[30][31][32]\n\nInvent This! – a weekly prime-time program showcasing inventors.[33]\n\nMicrosoft Insider Live – a pair of special live events that aired on October 5 and November 2, 2002.

A total of 33,452 seamounts and 138,412 knolls were identified, representing the largest global set of identified seamounts and knolls to date. Seamount habitat was found to constitute approximately 4.7% of the ocean floor, whilst knolls covered 16.3%.\n\nThe research leading to these results received funding from the European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme, and from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\nConservation International, GRID-Arendal and Geoscience Australia recently collaborated to produce a map of the global distribution of seafloor geomorphic features.

      "# [This Tiny $2k Computer is Nuts by Nostalgia Nerd on 2025-01-05](https://www.nostalgianerd.com/this-tiny-2k-computer-is-nuts/)\nTHIS is the Vulcan Flipstart. Also an Ultra Mobile PC, but nobody really knows about this one. Which is strange, because frankly. This thing IS NUTS.\n\nWe’ll get to the details of that in a bit, but first, LIKE EVERY DAMN VIDEO ON THIS CHANNEL, Let’s rewind to the early noughties. A time when tech was getting smaller and smaller, as opposed to absolutely mammoth like today’s world of tech playing Tonka toy. God I loved things like my lil’ Nokia 7210i… and one person who also loved it and indeed, wanted to capitalise on shrinking tech was Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.\n\nAllen wasn’t alien to new ventures. In 1986 he founded Vulcan Inc. to oversee his family’s business activities and philanthropic endeavours. In 1992 he co-founded Interval Research Corporation, a silicon valley new business incubator that generated over 300 patents, including some which he would later sue Apple, eBay, Facebook, Google, Netflix and Office Depot to name a few for violating.\n\nIn November 1993, he acquired 80% of Ticketmaster. In 1997 he purchased National Football League’s Seattle Seahawks, and in 1998 he purchased Seattle’s historic Cinerama Theatre, quickly upgrading it to 3D capability…. and that’s just naming a few of his business side quests.\n\nSo, it’s no surprise that with various companies having jumped on the Ultra-Mobile PC Market, including the infamous Toshiba Libretto, Allen would like to get involved in that, especially given his ties to Microsoft.\n\nPreviewed at the 2003 Consumer Electronics Show with the code name Mini-PC and then First showcased in February at Seattle’s 2004 DEMO Trade Show, the same show that had launched the original Palm Pilot back in 1996, the idea was simple; create a fully functioning Windows XP machine but in handheld form, and it certainly got the media’s attention.\n\nBut this wasn’t the first computer of this type of be announced; The Tiqit eightythree was showcased two years prior at the Planet PDA Technology show in Boston, the OQO Ultra Personal Computer had been announced in 2001 and was due out later in 2004 along with the then called Sony VGN-U50, sans keyboard.\n\nWhat made the Vulcan FlipStart different was really the name behind it; Paul Allen. Given all these machines were going to run Windows XP, it seemed like the FlipStart should really be the one ahead of the game.\n\nHowever, ahead started to feel like behind when it took a further 3 years before the FlipStart was actually launched, with the first units shipping on 27th March 2007. Here’s how they arrived, which I’m going to unbox as I explain the fact that in between its announcement and launch a lot changed, politics, the world, tech, the manufacture process of Pears soap, everything. Which meant some of FlipStarts specs also changed.\n\nOriginal specs detailed a 5.8x4x1 inch size, just under a pound in weight, 2-6 hours battery life, 20GB Hard Drive, 256MB of RAM, a 5.6 inch HDTV quality display, and a Transmeta Crusoe CPU.\n\nThe actual size came in a bit more at 5.9×4.5×1.6, with an extra half pound in weight. That might not sound a lot, but it makes a significant difference in a handheld device. However, double the amount of RAM, a 30 Gig drive, 1.1GHz Intel Pentium M processor and 64MB Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 900 try their best to make up for that.\n\nEven said, the FlipStart was now entering a world where literal pocket sized devices like the BlackBerry were common in business and where the first iPhone was starting its domination of the rest of the mobile world. Even Windows XP had been succeeded, by Windows Vista, although really…. that wasn’t much of a problem.\n\nRoger Kay, president of Endpoint technologies commented on the FlipStart’s launch;\n\n“The only people who will want that is someone with a tremendous demand for mobility and isn’t compromised by a lack of a fully functional set, they might sell a few as executive jewellery, but they won’t sell any more.”\n\nBut Allen was still very much convinced in it’s potential; “Years ago, I began to imagine a super compact computer that would allow us to connect, communicate, work and relax, no matter where we are — one that is intrinsically intuitive to use. FlipStart is the first commercial product to meet that vision; it simply works as expected.”\n\nThe FlipStart Itself\n\nAs you can see, we got a lot in the box. A Quick Start Guide, manual, battery, headphones, a lil’ dock like thing, a case, AC adapter, a crap load of cardboard, and of course, the FlipStart itself.\n\nFirst things first, we have to connect the battery. As standard you actually get the chunky version that gives up to 6 hours life, or at least, it may have 17 years ago. Christ, 17 years, it’s old enough to drive. We can then plug the AC adapter in, and BOOM, we have life. Windows XP life. Well after it boots. Honestly, seeing a standard PC boot screen on something like this is just so weird to me.\n\nOne thing you recognise right away is the absolute build quality of this thing. It feels like some kind of nuclear grade military tech. Like it would win in a game of Chicken with a Nokia 3310. It’s just so robust and firm feeling.\n\nIt also feels immediately weird to be using Windows, even XP, on a device so small, and that’s not just because we’ve largely abandoned devices like this, but it’s also because, well, this feels like a desktop computer, but it’s tiny. The screen being crisp, the mouse tracking definite, plus the fact it weighs about the same as a desktop PC all help to give it that larger than life feel. Its almost a little uncanny.\n\nSo the FlipStart feels like a big PC in some ways, but the brains behind Vulcan knew that this very much wasn’t a full size PC, so we’ve got a number of features to help us cope with the change in scale a bit better.\n\nYou’ll note the trackpad is over on the right, with the mouse buttons over on the left. This works pretty well, especially as the pad can be tapped and scrolled like a modern day trackpad. But if you don’t fancy tracking, we’ve got one of those noughties nubs that people got into for a while. They’re an acquired taste, but you can use it to fling the mouse cursor across the screen rapidly. Next to the pad you’ll notice a discrete CTRL-ALT-DELETE button, which is considerate, and the arrow keys.\n\nBottom left, there are a couple of new buttons. This one brings up the dedicated FlipStart menu, which allows you to jump to files and common organisation programs. The zoom button here is especially useful, as it resizes the window you’re currently using to good effect, you can then scroll about if needed. Press it again, and you’re back to normal. Neat.\n\nStandard media controls at the bottom, then over on the right is essentially an ALT-TAB button, allowing you to flip between applications, and a desktop button which, well, gives you the desktop. These are all very useful features, especially in the XP era.\n\nBut how does it function?\n\nLet’s start with the keyboard. I mean, it’s not ideal. I’m sure you could get used to it, in the same way you get used to a ZX80 keyboard, but it’s more suited for thumb typing. The only problem is, you need pretty large hands to use it in that way, rendering it a little tricky for typing. Compared to the Libretto, which had essentially a proper mini keyboard, the FlipStart lags behind\n\nBut for general Windows operation, it’s pretty great. All you really need to do is connect up a full size keyboard, and maybe a monitor, and well, then it’s really not a handheld computer anymore, BUT the fact you can do these things makes it versatile. However we need the right ports for that.\n\nOn the front there, we’ve got our standard indicator lights, on the right we’ve got a jog button, a headphone jack and some media buttons on the lid for use when its shut. The rear reveals one USB 2, a power in, an expansion port and a little heat sink vent which pours out some pretty warm air. Oh, we also have a little screen on the top which gives access to emails and the like when you don’t want to open it up. You can navigate using that jog button on the side. Pretty good for conserving battery life. Plus if you have an American version you can put a SIM card in here and connect up to your mobile network.\n\nIf you’re wondering about that expansion slot, that’s where the Port Replicator plugs in. Giving us a VGA out, speaker out, ethernet and two USBs. It’s kinda like a mini dock, and allows us to go into that FULL productivity mode.\n\nHell yeah, this thing is pumping out 1280×1024 on our new monitor, along with 1024×600 on it’s own screen with no sweat. Alright, maybe a little bit, but LOOK AT THIS SIZE OF IT. It’s nuts. You can push the build in screen up to 1024×768 if you really want, but then you just have to scroll about. There’s no need the standard resolution is decent and looks sharp as a pin.\n\nAlright screw productivity, let’s try and play some games on this thing.\n\nYou know it kinda works, out of the box, the FlipStart shipped with a Quake 3 demo, to show what it’s really made of, and why not, it works pretty well for most games.\n\nThe only times I ran into trouble were trying to use these little arrow keys to games which are very much geared up to use standard arrow keys. Crazy Taxi is a bit of a pain.\n\nOh, also you’re not going to get far in Typing of the Dead on this thing.\n\nBut it’s great. It’s almost like a lil Steam Deck, well ahead of its time. I can see many an exec getting in a quick blast on Grand Theft Auto on a lunch break. Pop some headphones on and who’s gonna know?\n\nHonestly, it’s a shame this didn’t sell better, because it’s both a crazy and incredibly professional bit of kit, and I can see why they’re so sought after today.\n\nWrong Timing?\n\nHowever, the FlipStart witnessed a slow uptake, with it’s US price slashed by $500 just 6 months after launch. By January 2008, it was down to $699, or just £339 in the UK, and by the middle of the year, all initial units had sold out, with Vulcan downing tools and making no more. With all warranties expiring a year later, support was withdrawn and the FlipStart faded into obscurity.\n\nThe FlipStart felt like something that people wanted. It felt like something that could fit in pockets and be useful. But it was just a little too big and bulky for that, and if you’re going to carry something around, you might as well make it a more usable laptop, especially given you could get more bang for your buck.\n\nRoger Kay it seems was right, it was jewellery, a gadget, a cool toy to show off, with very few practical uses, and weirdly enough that’s exactly what it remains. Unless of course you want to just use it as a very expensive and rare XP gaming handheld. Then, go for your life.\n\nPaul Allen fulfilled his tiny computer dream, and in many ways it was a great success. It does everything that he set out for it to do, and it does it well. It’s just the market wasn’t there for it. It was going in the opposite direction, and in just a few years we’d all be playing with whopping great ipads. It’s a shame really, because tiny tech like this, really is cool as hell.\n\nSo there we go, that’s the Vulcan Flipstart ultra mobile PC. What a fantastic piece of kit from the past. It’s also about to go on my eBay shop, which has just re-opened! So if you want to pick this up, or anything else, follow the link below and see what you find!\n\nUntil next time, I’ve been Nostalgia Nerd, Toodleoo.\n\n“TOSHIBA LIBRETTTTO, why do you come to myy barrrr?….

      "# [Elephant Populations Decline by 30 Percent](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2016-5-september-october/green-life/elephant-populations-decline-30-percent)\nA comprehensive $7 million, three-year study released today reveals that populations of savanna elephants across Africa dropped by 30 percent between 2007 and 2014.\n\nThe Great Elephant Census estimates that there are currently 352,271 savanna elephants spread across 18 countries, representing approximately 93 percent of the species’ range. Surveys of two additional countries should happen by the end of this year. “It’s in the spirit of elephant movements that we’re trying to create one of the largest landscape mosaics in Africa,” said Dr. Mike Chase, the study’s lead author, in a video statement released with the findings. “What was heartbreaking was I didn’t recognize or fully comprehend the scale and the rate at which elephants are being killed for their ivory.”\n\nPopulations dropped by 144,000 animals in seven years and are currently declining at a rate of 8 percent a year.\n\nThe international survey was funded in part by philanthropist and Microsoft founder Paul Allen and managed by his organization Vulcan, Inc. More than 90 scientists, six nongovernmental organizations, and two advisory partners contributed to the effort. Participants conducted survey flights beginning in February 2014. Spotters looked out of the low-flying planes to count the animals. Over the past three years, pilots have flown more than 180,000 miles using 81 airplanes carrying 286 people. The results of the survey, which was first published yesterday in the journal PeerJ, are also available here.\n\nAllen has been a vocal opponent of ivory poaching. “In order to save the elephants, we need stronger antipoaching patrols in Africa’s parks, more protection for elephant habitats, and the political will to apprehend and sentence ivory-trafficking kingpins,” Allen said last month on LinkedIn. “Yet even these vital measures are only half the equation. In addition to eliminating the supply of ivory, we also need to do a lot more to reduce the demand for ivory.”\n\nAlthough international commercial trade in ivory was banned in 1989, a major study by National Geographic released last year found that the international ivory trade has more than tripled since 1998. The majority of the ivory ends up in Asia and the United States. Two countries, Zimbabwe and Namibia, have asked for permission this year to trade ivory legally, according to National Geographic. Twenty-six African nations have submitted a proposal to prevent any such legal trade.",

The vast majority of the dataset is focused on invasive mammals. Data gathered from each project includes island location and characteristics, details about the eradication including focal species, methods and outcome, plus links and or contact details for learning more about the project.\n\nThe geospatial industry is a growing industry all over the world and here in the Pacific, there exists a hub (magazine) for women to collaborate, support, STEM and promote the profession to girls in school.\n\nFUGRO has sponsored the printing of this magazine to enable the distribution of “Pacific Women in Geospatial” to the girls and women in remote areas that have limited access to the internet.\n\nThe Multi-national Geospatial Co-production Program (MGCP) is a coalition of over 30 countries dedicated to producing high-resolution topographic vector data throughout high interest areas of the world. Data is extracted from high resolution imagery in 1° x 1° cells at a scale of 1:50 000. All data produced must meet a minimum horizontal circular error accuracy of 25m and meet MGCP Technical Reference Documentation (TRD) specifications, which details extraction guidelines and feature catalogues to ensure consistency.",

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on Vulcan Inc.\n\n## Company Overview\n\nVulcan Inc. was founded in 1986 by Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, to manage his business and philanthropic activities. The company has been involved in various sectors, including technology, real estate, and conservation efforts. Following Allen's death in October 2018, Vulcan Inc. has continued to operate under the leadership of his sister, Jody Allen, who has taken on a significant role in overseeing the company's philanthropic initiatives and business ventures [(Gee, I Programmer, 2023)](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/82-heritage/17430-paul-allens-enigma-machine-under-the-hammer.html).\n\n## Philanthropic Initiatives\n\nVulcan Inc. has been actively involved in wildlife conservation, particularly in efforts to protect elephants in Africa. A comprehensive study funded by Vulcan revealed a 30% decline in savanna elephant populations across Africa between 2007 and 2014. Paul Allen emphasized the need for stronger anti-poaching measures and habitat protection, stating, \"In order to save the elephants, we need stronger anti-poaching patrols in Africa’s parks, more protection for elephant habitats, and the political will to apprehend and sentence ivory-trafficking kingpins\" [(Sierra Club, 2023)](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2016-5-september-october/green-life/elephant-populations-decline-30-percent).\n\n## Business Ventures and Acquisitions\n\nVulcan Inc. has a history of strategic acquisitions, including a significant stake in Ticketmaster in 1993 and the purchase of the NFL's Seattle Seahawks in 1997. The company has also been involved in various technology ventures, such as Interval Research Corporation, which generated over 300 patents [(Nostalgia Nerd, 2025)](https://www.nostalgianerd.com/this-tiny-2k-computer-is-nuts/).\n\n## Product Development: Vulcan FlipStart\n\nOne notable product developed by Vulcan Inc. is the Vulcan FlipStart, an ultra-mobile PC that was first showcased in 2004 and launched in 2007. The FlipStart aimed to provide a fully functional Windows XP experience in a handheld form factor. Despite its innovative design, the product struggled in the market due to timing and competition from smaller devices like smartphones. Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies, remarked, \"The only people who will want that is someone with a tremendous demand for mobility and isn’t compromised by a lack of a fully functional set\" [(Nostalgia Nerd, 2025)](https://www.nostalgianerd.com/this-tiny-2k-computer-is-nuts/).\n\n### Specifications and Features\n\nThe FlipStart was designed to be compact, measuring approximately 5.9 x 4.5 x 1.6 inches and weighing just under a pound. It featured a 5.6-inch display, a Transmeta Crusoe CPU, and a battery life of 2-6 hours. However, the actual product was slightly larger and heavier than initially planned, which affected its portability [(Nostalgia Nerd, 2025)](https://www.nostalgianerd.com/this-tiny-2k-computer-is-nuts/).\n\n### Market Reception\n\nUpon its release, the FlipStart was priced at $1,199 but saw a price reduction of $500 just six months later due to slow sales. By January 2008, the price had dropped to $699, and production ceased shortly thereafter. The product is now considered a collector's item, with some enthusiasts appreciating its unique design and capabilities [(Nostalgia Nerd, 2025)](https://www.nostalgianerd.com/this-tiny-2k-computer-is-nuts/).\n\n## Company Scale and Workforce\n\nWhile specific employee numbers for Vulcan Inc. are not readily available, the company has been known to employ a diverse team across various sectors, including technology, real estate, and conservation. The company’s operations are supported by its philanthropic arm, which continues to focus on environmental and social issues.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVulcan Inc. remains a significant player in both the business and philanthropic landscapes, driven by the legacy of its founder, Paul Allen. The company's commitment to conservation and innovative technology products like the FlipStart reflect its diverse interests and impact. As Vulcan continues to evolve under new leadership, its future initiatives will likely focus on addressing pressing global challenges while exploring new business opportunities. \n\nFor prospective candidates and investors, Vulcan Inc. represents a unique blend of innovation, philanthropy, and strategic business management, making it an intriguing entity to consider for future engagement."
