The company operates as a privately held entity, managing a diverse portfolio that includes technology investments, real estate development, and philanthropic initiatives. Vulcan Inc. is known for its significant contributions to various fields, including science, arts, and sports, largely driven by Paul Allen's vision until his passing in 2018 [(Paul Allen by Contributors to Wikimedia projects, 2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen).\n\nVulcan Inc. generates revenue through its investment arm, Vulcan Capital, which focuses on emerging technology and internet companies. The company has made notable investments, such as acquiring 80% of Ticketmaster in 1993 and a controlling interest in Charter Communications in 1998. However, the latter resulted in substantial losses during its bankruptcy reorganization in 2009 [(Paul Allen by Contributors to Wikimedia projects, 2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen).\n\nThe company also engages in real estate development through Vulcan Real Estate, which is dedicated to creating sustainable and thoughtful developments that positively impact communities and the environment. Vulcan Real Estate specializes in mixed-use, residential, life science, and office properties, with a focus on projects that enhance air and water quality and foster vibrant cultural experiences [(Vulcan Real Estate)](https://vulcan.com/).\n\nVulcan Inc. is involved in philanthropic efforts, with Paul Allen having donated over $2 billion to various causes, including education, wildlife conservation, and healthcare. The Paul G. Allen Family Foundation has provided over $494 million to more than 1,500 nonprofits [(Paul Allen by Contributors to Wikimedia projects, 2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Jody Allen**: Following Paul Allen's death in 2018, Jody Allen has taken on a significant role in managing Vulcan Inc. and its various initiatives [(Paul Allen by Contributors to Wikimedia projects, 2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen).\n\n- **Steve Van Til**: Senior Director of Portfolio Management at Vulcan Real Estate.

The company also played a role in the redevelopment of the South Lake Union neighborhood in Seattle, which has been described as \"unexpectedly lucrative\" due to its significant real estate transactions [(Paul Allen by Contributors to Wikimedia projects, 2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen).\n\n## Product Development: Vulcan FlipStart\n\nThe Vulcan FlipStart, an ultra-mobile PC, was first showcased in 2004 and launched in 2007. Despite its innovative design, it struggled to gain market traction and was eventually discontinued [(Nostalgia Nerd, 2025)](https://www.nostalgianerd.com/this-tiny-2k-computer-is-nuts/).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\nIn recent years, Vulcan Inc. has continued to focus on its philanthropic mission and investment strategies.

We manage the tags using Google Tag Manager, which is a tag management tool that integrates with Google Analytics to derive usage statistics and performance analytics.\n\nIn order to provide the Site, VRE may use and share Aggregate Data collected through the cookies with third parties. For example, Google Web Tools interact with other Google Inc. products and services in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy. Please see the section below on “Managing Your Information” for ways to manage how your information is shared via Google Web Tools.\n\nHow Your Information is Used\n\nPlease see below on the circumstances where VRE may share your personal information with others without further notice, obligation or liability to you:\n\nService Providers: VRE may use third-party providers to provide or support some of the services that are available through the Site, including without limitation, communications and hosting services, network security, technical and user support, tracking and reporting, quality assurance testing, and other functions. VRE may share your information with these third-party providers so that they can perform their services or complete your requests. These third-party providers may share information with VRE that they obtain from or about you in connection with providing their services or completing your requests. Third-party providers may also share this information with their subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control.\n\nBusiness Transfers: VRE may share your information with its affiliated entities, prospective buyers, partners or joint ventures, in which case VRE will require them to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires VRE or all or substantially all of its assets (e.g. merger, acquisition or sale), that company will possess the same information, and will assume the rights and obligations with respect to that information as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nInvestigations: VRE may investigate and disclose your personal information if it has a good faith belief that such disclosure (a) is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on VRE; (b) is helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible fraud wrongdoing in connection with the Site; (c) is necessary to act under exigent circumstances to protect the safety of the public or users of the Site, or (d) is reasonably necessary to protect VRE’s rights, reputation, property, or that of its users, affiliates, partners or the public.\n\nLinks: The Site may contain links to unaffiliated third-party services. If you visit any websites through those links, the collection and use of your information will be subject to such third party’s terms and privacy policy. Unless there is a separate basis for sharing your information as expressly set forth in this Privacy Policy, VRE will not share your personal information with these third parties and is not responsible for their privacy practices. VRE will not be liable for any loss or damage that may be incurred as a result of accessing or using any third-party links through the Site.\n\nManaging Your Information\n\nCookie Settings\n\nYou may manage your cookies at any time through the cookie settings on the Site. Please note that if you change your settings to opt out of receiving cookies, it will not retroactively delete or remove any previously collected information, but it will prevent your information from being shared through such cookies from that point on.\n\nWithin the US: If the Site detects that your IP address is from a location within the United States, you will be prompted to accept or reject cookies when you first visit the platform. If you accept, you accept all of the cookies specified in the “Cookies” section above. If you take no action, you will be deemed as having accepted the cookies. If you opt out, you will be directed to a settings page where you can select which cookies to opt out of receiving. You cannot, however, opt out of Strictly Necessary Cookies, but you can configure your browser settings to block or alert you about them. If you block Strictly Necessary Cookies, some parts of the Site will have degraded performance or will not work. You can turn off cookies in your browser settings at any time, and delete previously saved cookies and other browsing data by clearing your browsing data and history.\n\nOutside of the US: If the Site detects that your IP address is from a location outside of the United States, all of the same apply as above, except if you take no action to accept or reject cookies, you will be deemed as having rejected the cookies.\n\nGoogle Web Tools\n\nYou can manage how your information is shared and used with Google Web Tools as follows:\n\nGoogle Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on: Google has developed a browser add-on tool to enable visitors of websites with Google cookies and tags to prevent Google Analytics from receiving their information. This add-on will not prevent websites from collecting information through other first party or third-party cookies and tags. You can download and install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to begin using this tool.\n\nGoogle Settings: In addition to above, you can manage how Google uses the information obtained through Google Web Tools and other cookies, and how it interacts with other Google products by changing the settings in your Google account. For example, you can restrict personalization features used in Google ads by changing your preference settings in your Google account to prevent use for targeted ads and content. Please review Google’s Privacy Controls for more general information on how you can configure various privacy and share settings through Google.\n\nThird-Party Tools: Third parties have also developed mechanisms for opting out of various cookies that use and share information collected from Google Web Tools and other sources for advertising purposes. For US-based users, the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) WebChoices is a tool that enables you to view and manage the cookies used for online advertising. For EU-based users, there is Your Online Choices.\n\nCompliance\n\nInformation collected from the Site will be stored and processed in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States and visit the Site, you permit us to transfer your information outside of your country.\n\nSecurity\n\nVRE is committed to protecting the security of your information and follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information it receives. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, devices, or cloud or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while VRE strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, VRE cannot guarantee its absolute security.\n\nPersonal Information of Children\n\nThe Site is intended for a general audience, and VRE does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you become aware that a child has provided VRE with personal information without parental consent, please contact VRE at [email protected]. If VRE becomes aware that a child under 16 has provided personal information without parental consent, VRE will take steps to delete such data as soon as possible without notice.\n\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\n\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) effective as of January 1, 2020 is a law that protects the privacy rights of California residents by putting certain requirements on how businesses collect and use personal information. VRE is committed to take the necessary measures to protect your personal information and comply with the CCPA as the specific requirements and application of the rules continue to develop over time. As part of this commitment, the cookie settings are available for you to change your settings any time.\n\nEuropean Union (EU) Residents: Your Privacy Rights Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n\nIf you are located in the EU, we will collect personal information only if VRE has one or more legal bases for doing so under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The legal bases depend on your interaction with the Site. VRE will only collect personal information from you where: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; (ii) it is necessary to perform a contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you; (iii) it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests; (iv) it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or another natural person; or (v) it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.\n\nData Subject Rights\n\nYou can submit a request regarding your personal information through the Data Subject Access Request Form. To submit the form, you must provide certain information such as your first name, last name and email address, your relationship to VRE, and details about your request.

For example the Kroenke's own the Nuggets and Kroenke Sports & Entertainment, with the Sports and Entertainment company owning Ball Arena. \n\nAs you can tell, most arenas are either owned by some government municipality, or the private company that also owns the team. I'm going to highlight a few exceptions:\n\nTD Garden- Owned by Delaware North Companies which is notably the parent company of the Boston Bruins, but does not own the Celtics.\n\nUnited Center- Jointly owned by the Bulls and Blackhawks\n\nChase Center- Owned by the Golden State Warriors\n\nStaples Center- Owned by the Anschutz Entertainment Group which specializes in being the owner/operator of sports venues. They also own the LA Galaxy and 50% of the Kings. While they have a minority stake in the Lakers and Sparks, they are not the majority owners of either the Lakers or Clippers like the owners I marked with an * above.\n\nMadison Square Garden- You could probably write a book about the history of MSG, but long story short, at this point in time it essentially owns itself.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID gefzqxf with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-12-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/k5jymy/finding_out_who_owns_every_nba_arena/gefzqxf/) (in reply to ID k5jymy):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID gf76i49 with +1 score by [(noodeloodel, Reddit, 2020-12-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/k5jymy/finding_out_who_owns_every_nba_arena/gf76i49/) (in reply to ID gefzqxf):\nI'm quite certain that these cities and municipalities do own these arenas, but they don't necessarily operate them.",
      "# Post ID 1apmpn4: sad that living computers: museum + labs is still closed but feeling a bit of hope! with +89 score by [(skyscapeparadise, Reddit, 2024-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1apmpn4/sad_that_living_computers_museum_labs_is_still/)\nWhen the Living Computers museum closed during the pandemic, several other Vale Group (formerly Vulcan Inc.) museums/public spaces closed as well including the Cinerama and the Flying Heritage Collection. It seemed as though none of these spaces would ever be open to the public again as the priorities of Vale Group appeared to be shifting away from these projects. However, given that both the Cinerama and the Flying Heritage Collection have been sold off to new owners who have reopened them, I'm hoping that Living Computers can meet this positive fate as well. I never had the opportunity to visit LCM+L since I had only recently moved to Washington at the time. Most people don't care about old computers but being someone who is really interested in history and technology, the thought of being able to try out a Xerox Alto or a PDP-11 or an Apple I seems incredible! It makes me sad that this one-of-a-kind resource has been in limbo, but my hope is that Vale is in the process of selling the museum to an owner who will give it the care and attention it deserves. I haven't given up the dream of being able to visit this museum!\n\n## Comment ID kq7dj58 with +22 score by [(aerothorn, Reddit, 2024-02-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1apmpn4/sad_that_living_computers_museum_labs_is_still/kq7dj58/) (in reply to ID 1apmpn4):\nIt's a fantastic museum, I am not holding my breath on it reopening but I hope with you.

I think she's done a poor job of handling the Seahawks as well. People like to say that Paul Allen deferred to the experts, but he wasn't afraid to rock the boat. For example, Mike Holmgren was given HC and GM roles when he came here. He had his GM powers revoked after poor drafts.

He wasn’t a football guy (more of a basketball fan) but he bought the Seahawks so they wouldn’t leave Seattle. He bought and kept open a lotta local little historical places like a computer museum and the cinerama. He also had a very hands on approach to the Seahawks where the community trusted his leadership. He definitely had points of conflict with the community, people either loved or hated his Seattle Commons idea to build a Central Park using the cities money but his land (people thought he should fund it himself and pointed out he was developing all the surrounding land) and his rich neighbors got annoyed the way he treated Lake Washington as his own personal pond (tho the stories are just funny to everyone else). However, ultimately Paul’s behavior made him someone people looked up to and that’s not the same for Jody. She’s been shutting down his program and has shown disinterest in properties like the Seahawks.

The Vulcan lawsuit was a civil suit that settled out of court and never had a criminal investigation. The allegations against Vulcan were sexual harassment, not sexual assault. Jody was accused of having fashion shows and undressing in front of bodyguards.\n\nIn contrast, Watson was accused of coercing massages therapists into performing sexual acts. Moreover, he was under criminal investigation for multiple accounts of sexual assault, and he admitted to most everything but the coercion. \n\nBoth cases are gross.

Watson trade wouldn’t end my fandom, it’d piss me right the fuck off and I’d tell everyone that asked “I love my hawks but Jody Allen can jump in front of a bus”\n\nOne can zoom out and find all sorts of things that each fan base should not support a team over. I abhor any Chiefs fan that dons a Tyreek jersey because he hit a pregnant woman…and that organization still allows him to suit up and play in front of tens of thousands cheering fans all because he can run fast? Cool. So as long as your are productive than, you can hit whomever you want if you are a Chief. But that’s not fair to the whole fan base because I’m sure there are a ton of people (going out on a limb here for humanity sake) who don’t support Tyreek for being able to play too. \n\nAre KC fans wrong for cheering their team on or it is possible, just maybe, to like the team as a whole and simultaneously despise individuals? Are Patriot fans not allowed to cheer on their team because Kraft got a handy in a massage parlor? Or Commanders fans not allowed to be fans despite Snyders multiple scandals and racist remarks? \n\nBy all means, if we are going to use consistency as a scope of argument then we should all never watch a game again.

I don’t want him on my team because my fandom is a personal investment of time and money into the product on the field. I don’t really care about the teams ownership group. I don’t think about them. I do think about the players. I root for them to do well. I suffer their failures. I like to discuss them. I don’t want to do that for deshaun Watson. \n\nIf I was making a moral stance I wouldn’t watch the NFL. it’s way too problematic of a league. But that’s not my issue with Watson. My issue with Watson is I find what he’s done to be too far for me to ignore and I don’t want to invest the personal effort of my fandom towards him directly. I’m not taking a stand, I just don’t have the motivation to be a fan of a piece of Shit of his caliber and would rather spend that energy doing something else. I don’t want to deal with other fanbases bringing him up. I don’t really want to talk about him at all. \n\nThe owner of the team never got that energy from me.

Bill Simmons named a recent podcast after this fact.   \n\nBut if we're being honest...\n\n... and it pains me to admit this...\n\n2020, in addition to many other shitty things, marks the official dethroning of the Boston Celtics as the GOAT franchise.  \n\n* Over the past 34 years, we only have 1 NBA championship (2008).   This week will mark the Lakers 8th during that same timespan (1987, 1988, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009, 2010, 2020)\n\n* As Laker fans like to point out, only 4 of our NBA championships took place after the NBA/ABA merger in 1976. This will be the Lakers 11th.  Bulls (6 titles) and Spurs (5 titles) also lead us in post-merger championships.\n\n* The bulk of our championships (57, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66) happened when the league was 8-9 teams deep.  \n\n* Magic (5 titles) vs Bird (3 titles) was a victory for the Lakers.\n\n* Even our 1 championship in 2008 was eventually vanquished by the Lakers when they won back-to-back titles in 2009 and 2010... essentially turning KG and the 08 Celtics into a Joe Frazier-esque footnote to Kobe's Muhammad Ali-esque championship legacy.\n\n* Lakers = 33 Finals appearances to Boston's 21\n\nIt sucks, but it is what it is.  The Lakers are the NBA's greatest franchise.  Must be nice to be in Los Angeles.  \n\nGotta hope that Tatum and his team can build a little dynasty here and start chipping away at the Laker league dominance.   It's been 12 years since our last championship.

Unless we draft another Pierce type of player (hoping JT is a Celtic lifer) and build a competent squad with assets and using those assets to trade for a superstar, its hard to see how teams like Boston with no geographical advantage can build a true championship squad for a 5 year window. \n\nLuckily for us Danny hit in the draft with Tatum and Brown.

Most NBA players (at least superstars) prefer a warm climate as they don't have to worry about little things like comfort with humidity or heat since they make a fuck ton of money. Cold is much more pervasive than heat. MLB players don't have to worry about it, the MLB season is spring-fall without the worst of winter. NFL players are out by the end of January and while they do have to go through winter, it isn't all of it. NHL players are a bit of a wild card- unlike NBA/NFL/MLB players, most NHL players are used to the cold being mostly Canadian, northern American, Scandinavian, or Russian. The weather isn't some horrific turn off for them like it is for a young NBA player.  \n\nNBA players are generally the ones that like to go out clubbing and partying more obviously at bare minimum than most MLB/NHL/NFL guys (how many other guys have jokes about them like Paul George and strippers, or Harden and strippers, or Kawhi and stri... you get the point, the biggest I can think of it NHL players can doing rails of coke in bar bathrooms- Bozak, Kadri, Hall are the biggies on that). Boston isn't a town built on the glitz, glamour, and nonstop partying like New York, LA, or Miami that appeals to stars with a thin veneer of gold covering a pile of failed ambitions. We are a town built on actually building shit that applies to real life in the sciences. It is a college town with the best colleges and universities in the country right up there with the best in the world. What is isn't, ZooMass excepted, is a party city- you don't have the crazy parties or clubs that New York, LA, or Miami have. If a college kid just wants to party, they go to ASU not to anywhere here. There is stuff to do absolutely, but most of it focuses on learning or history. LA has no history as a city, Miami has no history as a city, New York has some, but that isn't what you think of with New York. Boston, after colleges, medicine, and banking, has history as a big draw. That isn't an NBA thing- look at Leveon Bell who enjoys slapping ass at strip clubs and riding around jet ski's in Miami who had two places on his wishlist in FA- Miami and New York. Artemi Panarin went right to New York when he hit FA despite having a good team around him in Columbus because his girlfriend could find more work there are a model and they are known for enjoying nights out.\n\nTaxes are another reason- part of why Miami is able to get players there, look at the NHL and the discount deals that guys like Hedman, Stamkos, Kucherov, ect. took to stay in Tampa since they get far more there with no state tax than a player in Boston, Toronto, Montreal, ect.\n\nNBA players also hit FA a bit earlier than any other sport as most come in and play right away at 18/19 and can be a UFA by 25 with a 3 year rookie deal and 4 on a second contract, most MLB free agents don't hit the market until they are 29 or older, the best players are at minimum 26-27. The NHL is about the same, 26 being only for the guys like Tavares, most hit it in the 27-29 range. Look at David Pastrnak, 3 year rookie deal, then signed a 6 year deal as a RFA, no NBA player is gonna sign a 6 year deal- it is 4 with a player option for a 5th year likely that they will decline to make bank at 25. The NFL is a bit different- players can be UFA's by 26 in spite of playing football, but the big names the Pats have signed have been people ring chasing or using BB as a method to get a big contract somewhere else.\n\nThat doesn't sound like much, but the biggest thing I have noticed is players who have a family love Boston. Jarome Iginla played here one year and then moved here full time after retiring because he felt it gave his kids a great education and that was important to him. Guys like Theis, Hayward, IT,  Horford, ect.- the ones with family love Boston as a city. It has a ton of great qualities for a successful family. It doesn't have much to appeal to a young NBA player who likely wants to party, fuck, and enjoy the hell out of their personal life. We see a lot of older people from MA move to places like Florida or Arizona if they can afford it after their families have moved on into their own lives because once they aren't a family, the perks of Boston aren't as important anymore compared to a warmer, easier climate for their bodies. That goes full circle to NBA players without any attachments. \n\nTL;DR: New York, LA, and Miami are the business majors who are built, constantly partying, and having a good time- Boston is the nerdy, in decent shape but not built pre-med major who is focused on academia more than the college experience, NBA players are sorority girls on Tinder who don't give a shit about anything beyond the next 24 hours when they are swiping.\n\n#### Comment ID g83w370 with +5 score by [(pittiv20, Reddit, 2020-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g83w370/) (in reply to ID g83m0o4):\nThe actual answer is because there is legitimately nothing for a rich black man to do in Boston.

Watching the Lakers clinch on the court must be too devastating to them. Look at Pierce here:\n\n[http://archive.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2010/06/18/no\\_banner/](http://archive.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2010/06/18/no_banner/)\n\nWhat? the Celtics didn't deliberately lose earlier? then they weren't good enough to lose to the Lakers in the finals in order to maintain a 9-3 H2H record. Why is it then a credit to the Celtics? They sat home 14 times when the Lakers clinched.\n\nI know, I know, the Lakers lost 15 times in the finals, you folks say? Yet the Celtics lost 15 times in the Conference Finals (called Eastern Division Finals in the early years) in 53, 54, 55, 67, 72, 73, 75, 80, 82, 88, 02, 12, 17, 18, and 20. Yep, try to tell me losing in the Conference finals is a greater honor than losing in the finals. It sure pads their finals record of 17-4 and 9-3 H2H vs the Lakers really good.\n\n2020 is a great year. While the Lakers won their 17th title, the Celtics lost their 15th times in the Conference Finals, matching the # of Lakers' losses in the Finals.\n\n## Comment ID g81dwoh with +6 score by [(Ajeezy502, Reddit, 2020-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g81dwoh/) (in reply to ID j6y7pj):\nWe still beat them in regular season and finals matchup, they’re just better than the rest of the league\n\n### Comment ID g81ey0a with +7 score by [(idzova, Reddit, 2020-10-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g81ey0a/) (in reply to ID g81dwoh):\nCeltics vs. Lakers = Celtics are better.\n\n## Comment ID g828stx with +6 score by [(garvierloon, Reddit, 2020-10-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/j6y7pj/comparing_lakers_vs_celtics_credentials_as_goat/g828stx/) (in reply to ID j6y7pj):\nWell if you factor in the Chicago Bulls titles, the Celtics have 23 championships.

See how many top tier free agents went there and how many players indicated they wanted to be traded there. Shaq, Howard, Nash, Gasol, AD (who didn't want to go to Celtics mind you!), Lebron. How many decent 2nd tier, like Artest? Meanwhile Boston just had the KG + Ray Allen and recently Kemba, Kyrie was traded here and him being a cancer he left, so I don't even count that as a good trade. The rest they had to draft. Even Clippers are more attractive to players, cause it's in LA.\n\nKnicks might be worth more, but LA is THE team in NBA, they have it easy like Real Madrid in Spain - they are funded by the crown of Spain. Other teams like Boston, Miami, OKC and Bucks are more impressive cause they had to build it on their own. And Laker fans still think they were fucked on the CP3 non-trade. Puh-lease, if the league hadn't stepped in it might as well be LALBA (Los Angeles Lakers Basketball League).

For every shitty few years that the Lakers have, there's a LeBron or Shaq trying to play for them. They don't have to draft stars like most other teams because they can easily sign stars when they hit free agency.\n\nLet's say a neutral star free agent has two offers:\n\n- 4yrs/$120mil from the Celtics\n- 4yrs/$120mil from the Lakers\n\nThat free agent is choosing LA 9/10 times.

They do love the Blazers and Timbers, and sport is huge in the state in general.\n\nThe Portland metro area is probably large and wealthy enough. I feel like NHL hockey would have appeal as something new and different, which kind of fits with the eclectic attitude of the city, and the a lot of the state for that matter. \n\nThe biggest unknown is if there's enough interest to go around between the Blazers and the NHL. I just never knew anyone, friends, or co-workers, that had ever even given hockey a single thought. It would be a pretty raw market to develop fans in—similar to Vegas imo. A lot of fans would support the team because it's a Portland pro sports team and not because it's hockey.\n\n### Comment ID e1k94dz with +4 score by [(RoloTamassi, Reddit, 2018-06-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/8v1y5y/do_you_think_that_portland_could_support_an_nhl/e1k94dz/) (in reply to ID e1jwwzy):\nAlso from the GTA (Guelph represent) living in Portland.

It was Blazers, soccer, various outdoor sports taking advantage of the environment there, the NFL, and a bit of baseball.\n\n## Comment ID e1jxx4t with +6 score by [(BWinDCI, Reddit, 2018-06-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/8v1y5y/do_you_think_that_portland_could_support_an_nhl/e1jxx4t/) (in reply to ID 8v1y5y):\nI would love to see an ice hockey version of the Cascadia rivalry. Portland could very much support a NHL hockey team. They consistently have some of the highest attendances for the WHL and if the support of the Timbers/Thorns is to be used as any indication of how well a NHL team will be supported I think Portland would be a great NHL city.

The Portland metropolitan area has a population of around 2.45 million, and out of the 50 biggest metro areas in the United States it is ranked 15th in population growth. That gives it a bigger population than the metro areas supporting the Jets, Sabres, Hurricanes, Oilers, Senators, Flames, Predators, Blue Jackets, Golden Knights, and Penguins.\n\nPortland is certainly big enough to support a team, the question is if it would do so. Atlanta is the 10th largest metropolitan area in the United States and Canada, with a metro population of 5.79 million, yet the NHL failed to keep a team in Atlanta *twice* (the Flames were there from 1972 to 1980, and the Thrashers were there from 1999 to 2011). \n\nCould it?

Welfare programs exist, and are intended to help address poverty. They have limited funds. Every dollar wasted on fraud is a dollar not making its way towards combatting poverty. This means there's a need for better fraud detection software tailored to the needs of welfare programs.\n\nWant to help save the environment? Pick an environmental problem, and help scientists working on it write code to model the issue, or identify problems spots. Help them apply ML techniques to build decision engines and predictive models and such. There's *loads* of possible work here, it just pays like shit compared to building a CRUD app for an insurance company or whatever.\n\nI think the reason you take such a pessimistic view is that you view this only from the \"big picture\" perspective. Obviously no one software program is going to solve the whole climate change problem. But specific environmental problems certainly can make use of better software to solve them far more directly than just writing some web app to help people sign up for a mailing list. There's a vast world of difference between tackling coding problems that help people solve real problems in real life... and trying to change the world with the internet.\n\nEach of these huge problems is made up of innumerable small problems--and those small problems are often problems directly addressable by software.\n\n#### Comment ID dwbjyii with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2018-03-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dwbjyii/) (in reply to ID dwbf8fy):\nOn one hand, yes--I most definitely have a pessimistic view due to the big picture perspective... but how is looking at the totality of the problem not the way to solve it? What matter is it, anyway, if your software can detect fraud when the organizations running these welfare programs don't have the budget to run and maintain it, or if the fraud-doers are backed by corrupt politicians whose contrivances are vast and pockets deep such that anything recorded by the software is easily nullified by bribery? What matter is it if your software can help scientists model natural phenomena and better understand the data, when solving climate change is against the business interests of oligarchs and politicians who, together, can ensure that none of your recommendations are written and enacted into policy and that you will systematically find it difficult to get research funding?\n\nAgain, tools. Software is not going to directly address these problems at large; policy and the implementation thereof by state officials, really, are the direct solutions. Or maybe being a billionaire like Elon Musk--but even his solutions to the most challenging problems of our species which states all over the world are deliberately ignoring aren't software products by themselves.

Oh and I submitted my resume with a referral from a current employee, it took 13 months for me to get my first response.\n\n#### Comment ID dw9knr2 with +4 score by [(1dayHappy_1daySad, Reddit, 2018-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dw9knr2/) (in reply to ID dw98ei7):\nWoot?\n\n    require \"Universe\"\n    class Earth\n      attr_accessor :global_temp\n      def initialize\n        @global_temp = Universe::Earth.global_temp\n      end\n    end\n    muh_earth = Earth.new\n    muh_earth.global_temp -= 3\n\nGeez you people want everything done for you.\n\n#### Comment ID dw9emv9 with +3 score by [(shaggorama, Reddit, 2018-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dw9emv9/) (in reply to ID dw98ei7):\nThe demand is there, the companies that do that work just can't afford you.\n\n#### Comment ID dwa2o3e with +1 score by [(WillCode4Cats, Reddit, 2018-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dwa2o3e/) (in reply to ID dw98ei7):\nShit, well there goes my next app.\n\n### Comment ID dw9cpfx with +19 score by [(beegreen, Reddit, 2018-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dw9cpfx/) (in reply to ID dw97xz5):\nAlso if you want to be extreme about it don't eat meat or have kids\n\n#### Comment ID dw9d0j2 with +13 score by [(CunningFatalist, Reddit, 2018-03-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/87013t/how_can_a_programmer_like_myself_use_my_skills_to/dw9d0j2/) (in reply to ID dw9cpfx):\nOr just be thoughtful in general and teach your children to do so, too.

I've also seen them on green ways with bike paths right next to them. So awesome!\n\nBut I saw the street car in south lake union (the SLUT) the other day stuck behind an unoccupied car that had parked too far out into the lane and was blocking the tracks. The street car just had to sit there indefinitely whereas a bus could just go around easily. Additionally the street car is subject to traffic lights and typical traffic...and it seems to take a long time to build and a lot of money to install. To me, the street car in Seattle is basically just a big bus that's subject to a track. \n\nSo if it's not gonna be in a dedicated travel lane or space, why have street cars at all? Buses seem cheaper and more practical for Seattle. \n\nWhat am I missing?\n\n## Comment ID ic94hm0 with +248 score by [(Greedy_Craft, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic94hm0/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nOff topic but the First Hill streetcar is so slow that I literally outrun it during my morning jogs lol.\n\n### Comment ID ic95ovf with +135 score by [(blahcubed, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic95ovf/) (in reply to ID ic94hm0):\nI have outpaced the SLUT walking casually.\n\n#### Comment ID ic9axcp with +47 score by [(thearchiguy, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic9axcp/) (in reply to ID ic95ovf):\nHey now.

It isn't individual to just Seattle -- basically all of the 2010's modern USA streetcar (not light rail) projects have failed. In DC, Atlanta etc... The high construction costs meant the streetcars couldn't travel anywhere far.\n\nCompared to the BRT (lite) routes which have become much more useful in Seattle itself and say in Oakland's BRT, Richmond VA's BRT, etc.. which have had much better ridership and also with the vastly cheaper construction costs been able to reach much more useful destinations than being a 1/2 mile neighborhood loop.\n\nThat being said, I will note that the dedicated transit lane on Westlake the 40 and C bus use were basically only achieved because of the streetcar. (Note that means a lot of other bus routes can be improved by bus lanes, not to spend streetcar money just to get one dedicated lane)\n\nAlso fun fact back in 2015\n\n[https://seattletransitblog.com/2015/12/04/sound-transit-presents-st3-options/](https://seattletransitblog.com/2015/12/04/sound-transit-presents-st3-options/)\n\n**Option C1D** is the “Westlake Rapid Streetcar” option\n\nOne of the options for the Ballard link extension was actually to extend the South Lake Union Streetcar up Westlake through Fremont then to Ballard.

Busses usually cost more than a street car, are less energy efficient, and less dense with riders. Street cars have a psychological benefit of a sense of permanency that busses don't which tend to spur more business investment along the route than would happen with a new bus route. So economically, streetcars *tend* to be cheaper over a longer period.\n\nStreet cars have some soft benefits over busses as well such as being more easily understood, more comfortable, quieter, environmentally cleaner, spend less time at stops and more time moving, and are usually have better ridership.\n\nThat being said busses are great too. Relatively they're extremely cheap and quick to deploy. Cities can throw up new bus routes with decent stops in almost no time and very little upfront capital. Streetcar extensions take at least 5 years, often times getting as high as 15 years and cost a fortune upfront.\n\nMy opinion is that the city be focusing on deploying bus routes heavily across the city while simultaneously working on street car extensions in the most dense areas. As new street car routes come online, move the busses serving that route elsewhere or retire them if they're end-of-life, which with how long street car extensions take they very well may be.\n\n## Comment ID ic908cx with +103 score by [(HistorianOrdinary390, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic908cx/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nCars need a swift and harsh lesson that, no, they are not entitled to every inch of road in the city.\n\nBan cars from more streets, make more dedicated space for transit and alternative forms of transit.\n\nReduce the burden of SOVs so that those who *must* use them can do so with less traffic and those that have the option and mobility find transit to be just as good if not better.\n\n### Comment ID ic99nan with +43 score by [(AdultingGoneMild, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic99nan/) (in reply to ID ic908cx):\nremoving parking for cars along street car routes makes sense to me. open that space for bikes\n\n#### Comment ID ic9dy1f with +20 score by [(ALLoftheFancyPants, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic9dy1f/) (in reply to ID ic99nan):\nBike lanes next to streetcar tracks are very much  not ideal.

I don't know what those numbers might be, but my guess is that it's not a very significant number of people.\n\n### Comment ID ic9lxph with +4 score by [(letskeepitcleanfolks, Reddit, 2022-06-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/ic9lxph/) (in reply to ID ic97xif):\nIt's worth noting that fares only cover a minority of the expenses associated with providing bus service, with the majority coming from public funding.

Load/unload times that are a bit faster don't mean much when someone can walk faster than taking the street car in the first place.

Also weird the way people are derogatorily using \"urbanist.\"\n\nI think any incidental failing of transit will be used as an excuse to crucify the whole system. People who are concerned about their lifestyle, especially when that lifestyle revolves around a car, feel threatened by talk of expanding transit and closing off areas from cars. Obviously, this prevents progress.\n\nTangentially, it's incredible how some people will mock gun enthusiasts but turn around and try to hang onto cars. \"Muh guns\" turns into \"muh subaru,\" but people don't see the irony in that they're defending the deadlier machine. Personally, I'm not big on either. \n\nThat might be a little too meta though, so to directly answer your question OP, Seattle's implementation of streetcars has been pretty lackluster. This is in part due to the programs being gutted by NIMBYs and likely exacerbated by the number of cars on the road. \n\nI'm not sure where in SLU this happened but ideally streetcar lines should run down the center of the street, with car lanes on either side, and parking should always be at least a lane or two away from the streetcar. The situation you described shouldn't happen with proper implementation. \n\nBusses certainly have a number of advantages over streetcars, especially the more environmentally friendly electrified buses. Like you said, they have more mobility options, and it's easier to reroute things if there's construction or an accident or so on. A lot of buses also fit people more efficiently than a streetcar.  \n\nBut on the other hand, buses destroy their own infrastructure very quickly, have longer boarding/offloading times, and are harder to automate. \n\nI think the ultimate answer to transit in Seattle is to use both. Buses can serve more far-flung areas and bring people in and out of the city center, while streetcars should be used to connect major destinations within the city.\n\n## Comment ID icbvm6x with +3 score by [(marssaxman, Reddit, 2022-06-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/vbm7tw/change_my_mind_the_streetcar_in_seattle_is_a/icbvm6x/) (in reply to ID vbm7tw):\nSeattle did not build the South Lake Union Trolley because it made sense as part of a comprehensive transit network.

(https://seattletransitblog.com/2017/12/15/seattles-streetcar-turns-10/)\n\nWhen the streetcar first opened, it had even worse performance than what you see now because it didn't have any dedicated transit lanes.  Not that the dedicated lanes today help too much since it still has to contend with right-turning cars, especially at Denny Way.\n\nIt eventually got semi-decent ridership during rush hour with the Amazon crowd up until Rapidride C was extended to run down Westlake.

Which really proved that a bus makes way more sense in this corridor.\n\nThe only place I've seen a \"successful\" streetcar system that also has to contend with traffic is in Toronto.

A streetcar sharing a lane with cars can get stuck in traffic the same way a bus sharing a lane with cars can get stuck in traffic. Similarly, giving the streetcar its own lane speeds it up exactly as much as a bus would be sped up on that same route by painting a bus lane.\n\nStreetcars are seen as a nicer ride than buses, so the politics of devoting dedicated lanes to them may be a bit easier in certain cases, but we've failed at that for most (all?) of our existing routes so not very relevant here. Streetcars are also larger than buses, so they can be useful to deploy on routes where you'd otherwise need to run a bus every minute or three...again not very relevant here. \n\nGiven all that I'd err on the side of using limited transit funds to improve bus service and/or accelerate Link development.

It _should_ also fit into their \"Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer\", but it clearly doesn't.\n\nI worked (briefly) at Amazon over a decade ago. Customer obsession is actually something I really liked - it helped drive clarity whenever there was some sort of debate about what you should do. And here, the term \"customer\" isn't just \"people buying stuff on amazon.com\" - it included your partner teams that use your internal service, or the engineers that are using your build system, or whatever. Your. Customers. Are. EVERYWHERE. It was actually pretty fantastic.\n\nAnd yet. And yet, Bezos seemed to have taken a lesson from the 90s-era Microsoft. Design a company in which it's every man for himself (and let's be honest, tech is mostly men). Stories abound about the interpersonal bullshit at Amazon. But the painfully obvious conflict here is that customer obsession was (and maybe still is?) pervasive **except** when it comes to how you treat your employees. A few years ago, they added their \"Strive to be Earth's Best Employer\". This was _long_ after I left the company. My outsider-looking-in assumption is that it's all corporate doublespeak/PR to cover for the shitshow that is their fulfillment centers. If you simply recognized that your employees - as a first-tier people manager, as a VP of some organization, or as the CEO - are **your** fucking customers, then you don't need a new principle and you can drive improvement - real improvement and not \"RTO or else\" bullshit.\n\n#### Comment ID lq7gx1n with +3 score by [(bpeden99, Reddit, 2024-10-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1fvd0ox/google_says_it_wont_follow_amazons_lead_with_a/lq7gx1n/) (in reply to ID lq7g84p):\nMy experience with Teamsters union made me have the attitude of us vs corporate...

I am a remote employee, but we need a home hub. So in this company's infinite wisdom they decided that remote was no longer an option so all employees in the Customer Success org are now what they call office flex. We have been given three options; relocate to 1 of 3 support hubs, find new position in the company, or get a severance. No exceptions for medical or family need. Relocate or GTFO. Mind you that I am a mission critical employee that leads support for a money making feature of this company. And so they can either let me stay remote, make what I am making now, and just update my hub to be another location. OR they can spend thousands of dollars relocating me (they are paying for moving expenses) and then adjust my income by 10% so I would make more due to the cost of living in the new office. So it makes more fiscal sense to simply let me be, but they feel that relocation is the better option???? So I would then relocate, sell my home, get a way more expensive home, and then probably get laid off a few years down the road.......\n\n## Comment ID lq7q9bk with +1 score by [(programaticallycat5e, Reddit, 2024-10-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1fvd0ox/google_says_it_wont_follow_amazons_lead_with_a/lq7q9bk/) (in reply to ID 1fvd0ox):\nCause all the ex MSFT shit managers went to Amazon— what did you expect.

The manager to engineer ratio is incredibly large. \r\n\r\nManagement is constantly churning and the new managers are brought in from the outside, never promoted up from within. Groups working in niche fields built up capabilities only to have their efforts redirected by whoever the latest manager was who had no domain expertise. Managers were brought in based on their credentials at the biggest tech companies but the strategies they learned there were inappropriate to the size, scope, and audience of Vulcan projects.  Imagine a 2 person 6 month research project. Now bring in 3 managers who insist on making the prototype 'enterprise grade', halting progress. Be sure to berate the engineers on their way out. Projects managers focus more on reporting progress than progressing. I've never been at an organization which spends the amount of effort this one does to tell employees how great it is to work there. I wish I left sooner.",

Senior management will do anything to keep their well-paying jobs: they repeatedly move/alter project goals/direction and blame their employees when projects don't go as planned. Self-preservation at Vulcan is senior management's primary goal.  A series of poor hires at the C-suite level have sent the company reeling.

Without that simple but powerful force, it is hard to keep a company pointed toward true north.\r\n\r\nIn my five years in the tech department, it had about three name changes and 4-6 leadership changes. With each regime change I would feel a new sense of hope. “This guy (note: always a guy) seems like he understands business. He’s not just interested in creating a wacky invention, but he wants to make products for actual human beings.” Inevitably, users would fall to the wayside and we would ultimately build something for a white guy sitting in an ivory tower. While Mr. Allen had good intentions and creative ideas, he often wanted a cutting edge engineering solution to a big humanitarian problem. The non-engineering solutions were too dull. But the engineering solutions were often out of touch.\r\n\r\nOne thing was consistent: the worker bees were passionate about making something amazing and functional. Similar to Mr. Allen, they wanted to make a big impact in people’s’ lives. They researched ways to make science fiction come to life. They are smart, kind, creative, sharing people. However, the people who get promoted spout empty promises. They strut in like Donald Trump, fabricating business models and customer needs.\r\n\r\nIn some ways, it's hard to fault these leaders. When there is no business, then lying with flourish is the best way to personally survive. If they can’t be successful by making a sale, then success has to come from a bloated sense of self worth.\r\n\r\nIn the last regime change, things have gone slightly differently. The customer we designed for was no longer Paul Allen but instead a nonexistent customer who wants futuristic products at a reasonable price. In trying to productize Paul’s ideas, they are taking something developed in a lab and trying to make it a commodity, underfunding any R&amp;D that would maintain differentiation.\r\n\r\nLeadership isn’t taking a strong stance in any direction:\r\n- If it truly wanted to build products, it would expand the team size to function comparably to a competitor. Right now, teams of 2-10 people are trying to create a full scale business.\r\n- If it wanted to operate as a tech transfer office, it would partner with major companies. Instead, it keeps its tech development under wraps.\r\n- If it wanted to be a Google X, it would focus on R&amp;D and build truly futuristic product prototypes and not worry about making a sale.\r\n\r\nVulcan doesn’t know what it is. It never has. It always sat in a technological purgatory, partially because I don’t think Mr. Allen cared enough to commercialize. Without Paul Allen, it loses a leader that had a sci-fi imagination. That might be a good thing since his ideas never touched the ground. It might be a bad thing because there are no longer any ideas.\r\n\r\nRight now, it is trying to commoditize futuristic ideas for an imaginary customer. Best of luck.",

        "cons": "I’m also very happy to have left. Vulcan lacks paying customers. Without that simple but powerful force, it is hard to keep a company pointed toward true north.\r\n\r\nIn my five years in the tech department, it had about three name changes and 4-6 leadership changes. With each regime change I would feel a new sense of hope. “This guy (note: always a guy) seems like he understands business. He’s not just interested in creating a wacky invention, but he wants to make products for actual human beings.” Inevitably, users would fall to the wayside and we would ultimately build something for a white guy sitting in an ivory tower. While Mr. Allen had good intentions and creative ideas, he often wanted a cutting edge engineering solution to a big humanitarian problem. The non-engineering solutions were too dull. But the engineering solutions were often out of touch.\r\n\r\nOne thing was consistent: the worker bees were passionate about making something amazing and functional. Similar to Mr. Allen, they wanted to make a big impact in people’s’ lives. They researched ways to make science fiction come to life. They are smart, kind, creative, sharing people. However, the people who get promoted spout empty promises. They strut in like Donald Trump, fabricating business models and customer needs.\r\n\r\nIn some ways, it's hard to fault these leaders. When there is no business, then lying with flourish is the best way to personally survive. If they can’t be successful by making a sale, then success has to come from a bloated sense of self worth.\r\n\r\nIn the last regime change, things have gone slightly differently. The customer we designed for was no longer Paul Allen but instead a nonexistent customer who wants futuristic products at a reasonable price. In trying to productize Paul’s ideas, they are taking something developed in a lab and trying to make it a commodity, underfunding any R&amp;D that would maintain differentiation.\r\n\r\nLeadership isn’t taking a strong stance in any direction:\r\n- If it truly wanted to build products, it would expand the team size to function comparably to a competitor. Right now, teams of 2-10 people are trying to create a full scale business.\r\n- If it wanted to operate as a tech transfer office, it would partner with major companies. Instead, it keeps its tech development under wraps.\r\n- If it wanted to be a Google X, it would focus on R&amp;D and build truly futuristic product prototypes and not worry about making a sale.\r\n\r\nVulcan doesn’t know what it is. It never has. It always sat in a technological purgatory, partially because I don’t think Mr. Allen cared enough to commercialize. Without Paul Allen, it loses a leader that had a sci-fi imagination. That might be a good thing since his ideas never touched the ground. It might be a bad thing because there are no longer any ideas.\r\n\r\nRight now, it is trying to commoditize futuristic ideas for an imaginary customer. Best of luck.",

It was great for my career to dabble in cutting edge technology. It makes people notice my resume. It forced me to think outside the box. I am grateful for my time at Vulcan.",

Build a culture that cares about problem solving and creativity instead of filling out paperwork.

      "# [Paul Allen by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2001-05-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen)\nAmerican businessman (1953–2018)\n\nThis article is about the entrepreneur and philanthropist. For other people of the same name, see Paul Allen (disambiguation).\n\nPaul Gardner Allen (January 21, 1953 – October 15, 2018) was an American businessman, computer programmer, researcher, film producer, explorer, sports executive, investor, author, and philanthropist. He co-founded Microsoft Corporation with his childhood friend Bill Gates in 1975, which was followed by the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s. Allen was ranked as the 44th-wealthiest person in the world by Forbes with an estimated net worth of $20.3 billion at the time of his death in October 2018.[2][3]\n\nAllen quit from day-to-day work at Microsoft in early 1983 after a Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, remaining on its board as vice-chairman. He and his sister, Jody Allen, founded Vulcan Inc. in 1986,[4] a privately held company that managed his business and philanthropic efforts. He had a multi-billion dollar investment portfolio, including technology and media companies, scientific research, real estate holdings, private space flight ventures, and stakes in other sectors. He owned the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League[5] and the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association,[6] and was part-owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer.[7] Under Allen's helm, the Seahawks won Super Bowl XLVIII and made it to two other Super Bowls (XL and XLIX). In 2000 he resigned from his position on Microsoft's board and assumed the post of senior strategy advisor to the company's management team.\n\nAllen founded the Allen Institutes for Brain Science,[8] Artificial Intelligence,[9] and Cell Science,[10] as well as companies like Stratolaunch Systems[11] and Apex Learning.[12] He gave more than $2 billion to causes such as education, wildlife and environmental conservation, the arts, healthcare, and community services.[13] In 2004, he funded the first crewed private spaceplane with SpaceShipOne.[14][15] He received numerous awards and honors, and was listed among the Time 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2007 and 2008.[16]\n\nAllen was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2009. He died of septic shock related to cancer on October 15, 2018, at the age of 65.[17] Shortly after his death, in April 2019, the Allen-funded Stratolaunch first flew and became the largest aircraft in history by wingspan.[18]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nAllen was born on January 21, 1953, in Seattle, Washington, to Kenneth Sam Allen (a librarian)[19] and Edna Faye (née Gardner) Allen[20] (a fourth-grade teacher).[21] From 1965 to 1971 he attended Lakeside School,[22] a private school in Seattle where he befriended Bill Gates, with whom he shared an enthusiasm for computers.[22] They used Lakeside's Teletype terminals to develop their programming skills on several time-sharing computer systems.[23] They also used the laboratory of the Computer Science Department of the University of Washington for personal research and computer programming until they were banned in 1971 for abusing their privileges.[24]\n\nGates and Allen joined with Ric Weiland and Gates' childhood best friend and first collaborator, Kent Evans, to form the Lakeside Programming Club and find bugs in Computer Center Corporation's software, in exchange for extra computer time.[25] In 1972, after Evans' sudden death due to a mountain climbing accident, Gates turned to Allen for help finishing an automated class scheduling system for Lakeside.[26] They then formed Traf-O-Data to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor. According to Allen, he and Gates would go dumpster diving during their teenage years for computer program code.[27]\n\nAllen achieved a perfect SAT score of 1600[28] and went to Washington State University, where he joined the Phi Kappa Theta fraternity.[29][30][31] He dropped out of college after two years to work as a programmer for Honeywell in Boston near Harvard University where Gates was enrolled.[23] Allen convinced Gates to drop out of Harvard in order to found Microsoft.[32]\n\nMicrosoft\n\n[edit]\n\nAllen and Gates formed Microsoft in 1975 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and began marketing a BASIC programming language interpreter, with their first employee being high school friend and collaborator Ric Weiland.[33][23] Allen came up with the name of \"Micro-Soft\", a combination of \"microcomputer\" and \"software\".[34]\n\nMicrosoft committed to delivering a disk operating system (DOS) to IBM for the original IBM PC in 1980, although they had not yet developed one, and Allen spearheaded a deal for Microsoft to purchase QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System) written by Tim Paterson who was employed at Seattle Computer Products.[35][36] As a result of this transaction, Microsoft secured a contract to supply the DOS that ran on IBM's PC line, which opened the door to Allen's and Gates' wealth and success.[23]\n\nThe company restructured on June 25, 1981, to become an incorporated business in its home state of Washington (with a further change of its name to \"Microsoft Corporation, Inc.\"). As part of the restructuring, Gates became president of the company and chairman of the board, and Allen became executive vice president and vice chairman.[23][37] The relationship between Allen and Gates became strained as they argued even over small things.[26] Allen effectively left Microsoft in 1982 after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, though he remained on the board of directors as vice chairman.[23][38] Gates reportedly asked Allen to give him some of his shares to compensate for the higher amount of work that Gates was doing.[39][40] According to Allen, Gates said that he \"did almost everything on BASIC\" and the company should be split 60–40 in his favor. Allen agreed to this arrangement, which Gates later renegotiated to 64–36.[41] In 1983, Gates tried to buy Allen out at $5 per share, but Allen refused and left the company with his shares intact; this made him a billionaire when Microsoft went public.[41][42] Gates later repaired his relationship with Allen, and the two men donated $2.2 million to their childhood school Lakeside in 1986.[26] They remained friends for the rest of Allen's life.[43]\n\nAllen resigned from his position on the Microsoft board of directors on November 9, 2000, but he remained as a senior strategy advisor to the company's executives.[1][44][45] In January 2014, he still held 100 million shares of Microsoft.[46]\n\nBusinesses and investments\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Vulcan Inc.\n\nFinancial and technology\n\n[edit]\n\nVulcan Capital is an investment arm of Allen's Seattle-based Vulcan Inc., which has managed his personal fortune. In 2013, Allen opened a new Vulcan Capital office in Palo Alto, California, to focus on making new investments in emerging technology and internet companies.[47]\n\nPatents: Allen held 43 patents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.[48]\n\nApps: Allen backed A.R.O., the startup behind the mobile app Saga;[49] SportStream, a social app for sports fans;[50] and a content-management app called Fayve.[51]\n\nInterval Research Corporation: In 1992, Allen and David Liddle co-founded Interval Research Corporation, a Silicon Valley–based laboratory and new business incubator that was dissolved in 2000 after generating over 300 patents,[52] four of which were the subject of Allen's August 2010 patent infringement lawsuit against AOL, Apple, eBay, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Office Depot, OfficeMax, Staples, Yahoo!, and YouTube.[53][54]\n\nTicketmaster: In November 1993, Allen invested more than $325 million to acquire 80% of Ticketmaster.[55][56] In 1997, Home Shopping Network acquired 47.5% of Allen's stock in exchange for $209 million worth of their own stock.[57]\n\nCharter Communications: In 1998, Allen bought a controlling interest in Charter Communications.[58] Charter filed for bankruptcy reorganization in 2009, with Allen's loss estimated at $7 billion. Allen kept a small stake after Charter emerged from reorganization, worth $535 million in 2012.[59] The company's 2016 purchase and subsequent merger of Time Warner Cable with Charter's subsidiary, Spectrum, made Charter Communications the second-largest cable company in the U.S.[60][61]\n\nAerospace\n\n[edit]\n\nSpaceShipOne on ramp before takeoff in October 2004\n\nAllen (third from right) and Rutan (fifth from right) were awarded the Ansari X PRIZE by members of the X PRIZE Foundation in November 2004.\n\nSpaceShipOne at the National Air and Space Museum\n\nAllen confirmed that he was the sole investor behind aerospace engineer and entrepreneur Burt Rutan's SpaceShipOne suborbital commercial spacecraft on October 4, 2004.[62] The craft was developed and flown by Mojave Aerospace Ventures, which was a joint venture between Allen and Rutan's aviation company, Scaled Composites. SpaceShipOne climbed to an altitude of 367,442 feet (111,996 m) over the Mojave Air and Space Port and was the first privately funded effort to successfully put a civilian in suborbital space. It won the Ansari X Prize competition and received the $10 million prize.[63]\n\nOn December 13, 2011, Allen announced the creation of Stratolaunch Systems, based at the Mojave Air and Space Port. The Stratolaunch is a proposed orbital launch system consisting of a dual-bodied, 6-engine jet aircraft, capable of carrying a rocket to high altitude; the rocket would then separate from its carrier aircraft and fire its own engines to complete its climb into orbit. If successful, this project would be the first wholly privately funded space transport system.[64] Stratolaunch, which is partnering with Orbital ATK and Scaled Composites, is intended to launch in inclement weather, fly without worrying about the availability of launch pads and to operate from different locations. Stratolaunch plans to ultimately host six to ten missions per year.[65] On April 13, 2015, Vulcan Aerospace was announced. It is the company within Allen's Vulcan Inc. that plans and executes projects to shift how the world conceptualizes space travel through cost reduction and on-demand access.[66]\n\nOn April 13, 2019, the Stratolaunch aircraft made its maiden flight, reaching 15,000 ft (4,600 m) and 165 kn (305 km/h) in a 2 h 29 min flight.[67][68] Stratolaunch CEO Jean Floyd offered this comment: \"We dedicate this day to the man who inspired us all to strive for ways to empower the world's problem-solvers, Paul Allen. Without a doubt, he would have been exceptionally proud to see his aircraft take flight\". Upon its flight, the airplane became the largest in history by wingspan.[18]\n\nAs of the end of May 2019, Stratolaunch Systems Corporation had ceased operations.[69]\n\nReal estate\n\n[edit]\n\nAllen's Vulcan Real Estate[70] division offers development and portfolio management services, and was involved in the redevelopment of the South Lake Union neighborhood immediately north of downtown Seattle.[71] Vulcan has developed 6.3 million square feet (590,000 m2) of new residential, office, retail and biotechnology research space, and has a total development capacity of 10,000,000 sq ft (930,000 m2). Vulcan advocated for the Seattle Streetcar line known as South Lake Union Streetcar, which runs from Seattle's Westlake Center to the south end of Lake Union.[72] In 2012, The Wall Street Journal called Allen's South Lake Union investment \"unexpectedly lucrative\" and one that led to his firm selling a 1,800,000-square-foot (170,000 m2) office complex to Amazon.com for US$1.16 billion, one of the most expensive office deals ever in Seattle.[73] \"It's exceeded my expectations\", Allen said of the South Lake Union development.[74]\n\nVenues\n\n[edit]\n\nSports and event centers: Allen funded the development of Portland's Moda Center, which he purchased in 2007.[75] He also contributed $130 million to help build CenturyLink Field in Seattle.[76]\n\nSeattle Cinerama: Allen purchased Seattle's historic Cinerama Theater in 1998, and upgraded it with 3-D capability and digital sound, in addition to interior and exterior refurbishing. The theater installed the world's first commercial digital laser projector in 2014.[77]\n\nHospital Club: Allen opened the Hospital Club in London in 2004 as a professional and social hub for people working in the creative arts.[78] A second location in Los Angeles is under construction.[79]\n\nSports team ownership\n\n[edit]\n\nPortland Trail Blazers\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Portland Trail Blazers\n\nAllen purchased the Portland Trail Blazers NBA team in 1988 from California real estate developer Larry Weinberg for $70 million.[6] He was instrumental in the development and funding of the Moda Center (previously known as the Rose Garden), the arena where the Blazers play. He purchased the arena on April 2, 2007, and stated that this was a major milestone and a positive step for the franchise.[23][80] The Allen-owned Trail Blazers reached the playoffs 19 times including the NBA Finals in 1990 and 1992.[81] According to Forbes, the Blazers were valued at $2.09 billion in 2021 and ranked No. 13 out of 30 NBA teams.[82]\n\nSeattle Seahawks\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Seattle Seahawks\n\nAllen purchased the National Football League's Seattle Seahawks in 1997 from owner Ken Behring,[83][84] who had attempted to move the team to southern California the previous year.[5][85][86] Herman Sarkowsky, a former Seahawks minority owner, told The Seattle Times about Allen's decision to buy the team, \"I'm not sure anybody else in this community would have done what [Allen] did.\"[87]\n\nAs told to Howard Stern in 2015, Allen approached Adam Sandler and told him to \"86\" the references to him being Jewish in Sandler's harmless Channukah song he performed on SNL. After approaching him in a restaurant, Allen became extremely defensive about being called a \"Jew.\" [88]\n\nIn 2002, the team moved into Seahawks Stadium (now known as Lumen Field), after Allen invested into the upgrade of the stadium.[89] Acquired for US$200 million in 1997,[83][84] the Seahawks were valued at $1.33 billion in August 2014 by Forbes, which says the team has \"one of the most rabid fan bases in the NFL\".[90] Under the helm of Allen, the Seahawks made the Super Bowl three times following NFC Championship victories (2005, 2013, 2014), and won Super Bowl XLVIII in February 2014.[91]\n\nSeattle Sounders FC\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Seattle Sounders FC\n\nAllen's Vulcan Sports & Entertainment is part of the ownership team of the Seattle Sounders FC, a Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise that began play in 2009 at CenturyLink Field, a stadium which was also controlled by Allen.[7] The ownership team also includes film producer Joe Roth, businessman Adrian Hanauer, and comedian Drew Carey. The Sounders sold out every home game during its first season, setting a new MLS record for average match attendance.[92]\n\nFilmmaking\n\n[edit]\n\nAllen and his sister, Jody Allen, together were the owners and executive producers of Vulcan Productions,[93] a television and film production company headquartered in Seattle within the entertainment division of Vulcan Inc. Their films have received various recognition, ranging from a Peabody Award[94] to Independent Spirit Awards,[95] Grammys[96] and Emmys.\n\nIn 2014 alone, Allen's film, We The Economy, won 12 awards including a Webby award for best Online News & Politics Series. The films have also been nominated for Golden Globes[96] and Academy Awards[95] among many others. Vulcan Productions' films and documentary projects include Far from Heaven[95] (2002), Hard Candy[97] (2005), Rx for Survival: A Global Health Challenge[98][99] (2005), Where God Left His Shoes[100] (2006), Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial[101][102] (2007), This Emotional Life[103][104] (2010), We The Economy[105] (2014) Racing Extinction[106] (2015) and Oscar-nominated Body Team 12[107] (2015).\n\nIn 2013, Vulcan Productions co-produced the Richard E. Robbins-directed film Girl Rising[108] which tells the stories of girls from different parts of the world who seek an education. Globally, over 205 million households watched Girl Rising during the CNN premier,[109] and over 4 million people have engaged with Girl Rising through websites and social media. Through the associated 10×10 program, over $2.1 million has been donated to help girls receive an education worldwide.[110]\n\nAlso in 2013, Vulcan Productions signed on as a producing partner of Pandora's Promise,[111] a documentary about nuclear power, directed by Oscar-nominated director Robert Stone. It was released on CNN in November 2013. A variety of college and private screenings as well as panel discussions have been hosted throughout the country.[112]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\n[edit]\n\nAllen gave more than $2 billion towards the advancement of science, technology, education, wildlife conservation, the arts, and community services in his lifetime.[13] The Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, which he founded with his sister Jody, was established to administer a portion of Allen's philanthropic contributions. Since its formation, the foundation has given more than $494 million to over 1,500 nonprofits; and,[113] in 2010, Allen became a signatory of The Giving Pledge, promising to give at least half of his fortune to philanthropic causes.[114] Allen received commendations for his philanthropic commitments including the Andrew Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy[115] and Inside Philanthropy's \"Philanthropist of the Year\".[116]\n\nScience and research\n\n[edit]\n\nIn September 2003, Allen launched the Allen Institute for Brain Science with a $100 million contribution dedicated to understanding how the human brain works. In total, Allen donated $500 million to the institute, making it his single largest philanthropic recipient. Since its launch, the Allen Institute for Brain Science has taken a Big Science and open science approach to tackle projects. The institute makes research tools available to the scientific community using an open data model.[117] Some of the institute's projects include the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, Allen Human Brain Atlas and the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas. The Allen Institute is also helping to advance and shape the White House's BRAIN Initiative as well as the Human Brain Project.[118]\n\nFounded in 2014, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2)'s main focus is to research and engineer artificial intelligence.[119] The institute is modeled after the Allen Institute for Brain Science and led by researcher and professor, Dr. Oren Etzioni. AI2 has undertaken four main projects, Aristo, Semantic Scholar, Euclid, and Plato. As of 2015 Project Aristo is working to build an AI system capable of passing an 8th-grade science exam.[120]\n\nIn December 2014, Allen committed $100 million to create the Allen Institute for Cell Science in Seattle. The institute is investigating and creating a virtual model of cells in the hope of bringing forth treatment of different diseases.[121] Like the institutes before it, all data generated and tools developed will be made publicly available online.[122]\n\nLaunched in 2016 with a $100 million commitment, The Paul G. Allen Frontiers Group aims to discover and support ideas at the frontier of bioscience in an effort to accelerate the pace of discovery.[123] The group will target scientists and research areas that \"some might consider out-of-the-box at the very edges of knowledge\".[124]\n\nAllen launched the Allen Distinguished Investigators Awards (ADI) in 2010 to support scientists pursuing early-stage research projects who often have difficulty securing funding from traditional sources.[125] Allen donated the seed money to build SETI's Allen Telescope Array, eventually contributing $30 million to the project.[126]\n\nThe Paul Allen's flower fly was named in recognition of his contributions to Dipterology.[127]\n\nEnvironment and conservation\n\n[edit]\n\nAllen provided more than $7 million to fund a census of elephant populations in Africa, the largest such endeavour since the 1970s. The Great Elephant Census team flew over 20 countries to survey African savannah elephants. The survey results were published in 2015 and showed rapid rates of decline which were accelerating.[128]\n\nHe began supporting the University of British Columbia's Sea Around Us Project in 2014 to improve data on global fisheries as a way to fight illegal fishing. Part of his $2.6 million in funding went towards the creation of FishBase,[129] an online database about adult finfish.[130] Allen funded the Global FinPrint initiative, launched in July 2015, a three-year survey of sharks and rays in coral reef areas. The survey is the largest of its kind and designed to provide data to help conservation programs.[131][132]\n\nAllen backed Washington state initiative 1401 to prohibit the purchase, sale and distribution of products made from 10 endangered species including elephants, rhinos, lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs, marine turtles, pangolins, sharks and rays. The initiative gained enough signatures to be on the state's ballot on November 3, 2015, and passed.[133]\n\nAlongside the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), Allen and Vulcan Inc. launched the Smart City Challenge,[134] a contest inviting American cities to transform their transportation systems. Created in 2015 with the USDOT's $40 million commitment as well as $10 million from Allen's Vulcan Inc., the challenge aims to create a first-of-its-kind modern city that will demonstrate how cities can improve quality of life while lowering greenhouse gas emissions.[135] The winning city was Columbus, Ohio.[136]\n\nAs a member of the International SeaKeepers Society, Allen hosted its proprietary SeaKeeper 1000TM oceanographic and atmospheric monitoring system on all three of his megayachts.[137]\n\nAllen funded the building of microgrids, which are small-scale power grids that can operate independently, in Kenya, to help promote reusable energy and empower its businesses and residents.[138] He was an early investor in the Mawingu Networks, a wireless and solar-powered Internet provider which aims to connect rural Africa with the world, and Off Grid Electric, a company focused on providing solar energy to people in emerging nations.[139]\n\nEbola\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2014, Allen pledged at least $100 million toward the fight to end the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa,[140] making him the largest private donor in the Ebola crisis. He also created a website called TackleEbola.org[141] as a way to spread awareness and serve as a vehicle for donors to fund projects in need. The site highlighted organizations working to stop Ebola that Allen supported, such as International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, Médecins Sans Frontières, Partners in Health, UNICEF and World Food Program USA. On April 21, 2015, Allen brought together key leaders in the Ebola fight at the Ebola Innovation Summit in San Francisco. The summit aimed to share key learnings and reinforce the need for continued action and support to reduce the number of Ebola cases to zero, which was achieved in January 2016.[142]\n\nIn October 2015, the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation announced it would award seven new grants totaling $11 million to prevent future widespread outbreaks of the virus.[143]\n\nExploration\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2012, along with his research team and the Royal Navy, Allen attempted to retrieve the ship's bell from HMS Hood, which sank in the Denmark Strait during World War II, but the attempt failed due to poor weather. On August 7, 2015, they tried again and recovered the bell in very good condition.[144] It was restored and put on display in May 2016 in the National Museum of the Royal Navy, Portsmouth, in remembrance of the 1,415 crewmen lost.[145]\n\nSince 2015, Allen funded the research ship RV Petrel, which he purchased in 2016. The project team aboard Petrel was responsible for locating the Japanese battleship Musashi in 2015.[146] In 2017, at Allen's direction, Petrel found USS Indianapolis, USS Ward, the wrecks of the Battle of Surigao Strait and the Battle of Ormoc Bay. In 2018, Petrel found a lost US Navy C-2A Greyhound aircraft in the Philippine Sea, USS Lexington in the Coral Sea and the USS Juneau off the coast of the Solomon Islands.[147][148][149]\n\nMuseums and community institutions\n\n[edit]\n\nAllen established non-profit community institutions to display his collections of historic artifacts. These include:\n\nMuseum of Pop Culture, or MoPOP, is a nonprofit museum, dedicated to contemporary popular culture inside a Frank Gehry–designed building at Seattle Center, established in 2000.[150]\n\nFlying Heritage Collection, which showcases restored vintage military aircraft and armaments primarily from the World War II era, established in 2004.[151]\n\nSTARTUP Gallery, a permanent exhibit at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science in Albuquerque dedicated to the history of the microcomputer, established in 2007.[152]\n\nLiving Computer: Museum + Labs, a collection of vintage computers in working order and available for interactive sessions on-site or through networked access, opened to the public in 2012.[153][154]\n\nArt\n\n[edit]\n\nAn active art collector, Allen gifted more than $100 million to support the arts.[155] On October 15, 2012, the Americans for the Arts gave Allen the Eli and Edythe Broad Award for Philanthropy in the Arts.[156] Allen loaned out more than 300 pieces from his private art collection to 47 different venues. The original 541-page typescript of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula was in his collection at one point.[157] In 2013, Allen sold Barnett Newman's Onement VI (1953) at Sotheby's in New York for $43.8 million, then the record for a work by the abstract artist.[158][159]\n\nIn 2015, Allen founded the Seattle Art Fair, a four-day event with 60-plus galleries from around the world including the participation of the Gagosian Gallery, David Zwirner. The event drew thousands and inspired other satellite fairs throughout the city.[160]\n\nIn August 2016, Allen announced the launch of Upstream Music Fest + Summit,[161] an annual festival fashioned after South by Southwest.[162] Held in Pioneer Square, the first festival took place in May 2017.[163] It was cancelled in 2019 following Allen's death in 2018.[164]\n\nIn November 2022, Allen's art collection was auctioned at Christie's New York.[165] It was the biggest sale in art auction history, surpassing $1.5 billion in sales. Six works sold for more than $100 million: Seurat's Les Poseuses Ensemble (Petite version), ($149 million, with fees); Paul Cézanne's 1888-90 La Montagne Sainte-Victoire ($138 million); van Gogh's Verger avec cyprès ($117 million); and Gustav Klimt's 1903 Birch Forest ($105 million). The auction also included paintings by Botticelli, David Hockney, Roy Lichtenstein, Edward Hopper, Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns and Jan Brueghel the Younger. Proceeds from the auction benefitted undisclosed philanthropies.[166][167][168]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1989, Allen donated $2 million to the University of Washington to construct the Allen Library, which was named after his father Kenneth S. Allen, a former associate director of the University of Washington library system.[169] In the same year, Allen donated an additional $8 million to establish the Kenneth S. Allen Library Endowment.[170] In 2012, the endowment was renamed the Kenneth S. and Faye G. Allen Library Endowment after Allen's mother (a noted bibliophile) died.[171]\n\nIn 2002, Allen donated $14 million to the University of Washington to construct the Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science and Engineering.[172] The building was dedicated in October 2003.[173]\n\nIn 2010, Allen announced a gift of $26 million to build the Paul G. Allen School of Global Animal Health at Washington State University, his alma mater. The gift was the largest private donation in the university's history.[174]\n\nIn 2016, Allen pledged a $10 million donation over four years for the creation of the Allen Discovery Centers at Tufts University and Stanford University. The centers would fund research that would read and write the morphogenetic code. Over eight years the donation could be as much as $20 million.[175]\n\nIn 2017, Allen donated $40 million (with an additional $10 million from Microsoft) to reorganize the University of Washington's Computer Science and Engineering department into the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering.[176]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile Allen expressed interest in romantic love and one day having a family,[177] he never married and had no children.[178] His marriage plans with his first girlfriend were cancelled as he felt he \"was not ready to marry at 23\".[39] He was sometimes considered reclusive.[179][180] In the 1990s, he purchased Rock Hudson's Los Angeles estate from film director John Landis and added the Neptune Valley recording studio to the property. Allen's family put the home on the market for $56 million after his death.[181]\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nAllen received his first electric guitar at the age of sixteen, and was inspired to play it by listening to Jimi Hendrix.[182] In 2000, Allen played rhythm guitar on the independently produced album Grown Men.[183] In 2013, he had a major label release on Sony's Legacy Recordings: Everywhere at Once by Paul Allen and the Underthinkers.[184] PopMatters.com described Everywhere at Once as \"a quality release of blues-rock that's enjoyable from start to finish\".[185][186]\n\nOn February 7, 2018, an interview by the magazine New York on their Vulture website, Quincy Jones expressed respect for Allen's talent, saying he \"sings and plays just like Hendrix\".[187]\n\nYachting\n\n[edit]\n\nAllen's 414-foot (126 m) yacht, Octopus, was launched in 2003.[188] As of 2019, it was 20th on the list of motor yachts by length. The yacht is equipped with two helicopters, a submarine, an ROV, a swimming pool, a music studio and a basketball court.[189] Octopus is a member of AMVER, a voluntary group ship reporting system used worldwide by authorities to arrange assistance for those in distress at sea.[190] The ship is also known for its annual celebrity-studded parties which Allen hosted at the Cannes film festival,[191] where Allen and his band played for guests. These performances included musicians such as Usher and Dave Stewart.[192] Octopus was also used in the search for a missing American pilot and two officers whose plane disappeared off Palau,[193] and the study of a rare fish called a coelacanth, among many others.[194] Following Allen's death in 2018, Octopus was refitted and put on the market for $325 million.[195]\n\nAllen also owned Tatoosh, one of the world's 100 largest yachts. In January 2016, it was reported that Tatoosh severely damaged approximately 1300 square meters of coral reef in the West Bay replenishment zone, Cayman Islands.[196] In April 2016, the Department of Environment (DoE) and Allen's Vulcan Inc. successfully completed a restoration plan to help speed recovery and protect the future of coral in this area.[197]\n\nIdea Man\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Idea Man\n\nIn 2011, Allen's memoir, Idea Man: A Memoir by the Co-founder of Microsoft, was published by Portfolio, a Penguin Group imprint. The book recounts how Allen became enamored with computers and, at an early age, conceived the idea for Microsoft, recruited his friend Bill Gates to join him, and launched what would become the world's most successful software company. It also explores Allen's business and creative ventures following his 1983 departure from Microsoft, including his involvement in SpaceShipOne, his purchase of the Portland Trail Blazers and Seattle Seahawks, his passion for music, and his ongoing support for scientific research. The book made the New York Times Best Seller list. A paperback version, which included a new epilogue, was published on October 30, 2012.[198][199]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nAllen was diagnosed with Stage 1-A Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1982.[41] His cancer was successfully treated by several months of radiation therapy.[38] Allen was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2009. Likewise, the cancer was successfully treated until it returned in 2018. It ultimately caused his death by septic shock on October 15, 2018.[200][17] He was 65 years old.[201][202] Allen's sister, Jody Allen, was named executor and trustee of his estate.[195][203]\n\nSeveral Seattle-area landmarks, including the Space Needle, Columbia Center and Lumen Field, as well as various Microsoft offices throughout the United States, were illuminated in blue on November 3, 2018, as a tribute to Allen.[204] He was also honored by his early business partner and lifelong friend Bill Gates, who said in a statement:\n\nPaul loved life and those around him, and we all cherished him in return. He deserved much more time, but his contributions to the world of technology and philanthropy will live on for generations to come. We will miss him tremendously.[43]\n\nAwards and recognition\n\n[edit]\n\nAllen received numerous awards in many different areas, including sports, technology, philanthropy, and the arts:\n\nIn 2004, Allen, Burt Rutan, Doug Shane, Mike Melvill, and Brian Binnie won the Collier Trophy for SpaceShipOne.[14]\n\nOn March 9, 2005, Allen, Rutan, and the rest of the SpaceShipOne team were awarded the 2005 National Air and Space Museum Trophy for Current Achievement.[15]\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, Allen was listed among the Time 100 Most Influential People in The World.[16]\n\nHe received the Vanguard Award from the National Cable & Telecommunications Association on May 20, 2008.[205]\n\nOn October 30, 2008, the Seattle-King County Association of Realtors honored Allen for his \"unwavering commitment to nonprofit organizations in the Pacific Northwest and lifetime giving approaching US$1 billion\".[206]\n\nIn 2009, Allen's philanthropy as the long-time owner of the Portland Trail Blazers was recognized with an Oregon Sports Award.[207]\n\nOn October 26, 2010, Allen was awarded the W.

      "# [Are the Trail Blazers Any Closer to Being Sold? by Dave Deckard, www.facebook.com on 2024-07-31](https://www.blazersedge.com/2024/7/31/24209769/portland-trail-blazers-sale-rumors-jody-allen-nba-tv-rights-deal-broadcast-amount-vulcan-inc-paul)\nThe Portland Trail Blazers have changed coaches, general managers, and floor personnel over the last four years, but their ownership has remained the same throughout. As of July, 2024, Jody Allen and Vulcan Sports still hold controlling interest in the franchise, to the chagrin of many Blazers fans who expect—and perhaps want—the team to be sold. Are we any closer to that event this summer than we were last? That’s the subject of today’s Blazer’s Edge Mailbag.\n\nHello Dave,\n\nWith the new NBA television deal having been finalized, will that make it any more likely that Jody will sell the team to a new owner sooner rather than later? Perhaps she plans to hang on to the team indefinitely? What are your thoughts?\n\nPatrick B\n\nMeddling in the minds of NBA owners is perilous business, but I would guess that finalizing the new broadcast rights deal was a necessary step to setting the price of the team, should it be sold.\n\nLots of people guessed at potential numbers for the new contract. I’m not sure $76 billion over 11 years crossed anyone’s lips until it happened. Surely incumbent owners had a clue, but they couldn’t very well broadcast (ha!) the amount. Nor would it have shown up on organizational ledgers. Until the deal got done, it was vapor and rumor.\n\nNow both seller and buyer have a tangible forecast for this critical revenue stream over the next decade. That’s one of the two major undecided pieces, along with any expansion fees franchises might rake in. And the broadcast deal is by far the bigger.\n\nWith the numbers in place, sellers can now account for the increased value of the franchise during the span of the deal, while buyers can factor in the income from broadcast partners. This makes setting—and paying—a price much easier.\n\nSo I’d guess that if the Trail Blazers are going to be sold anytime soon, we’re one step closer to the transaction...one of the most important steps, at that.\n\nThat said, be careful what you wish for. Who buys the franchise next is going to be just as important as the final price or timing of the sale. Ownership is increasingly becoming the province of billionaires, a trend that late owner Paul Allen helped pioneer. Once upon a time, teams were purchased by fanatical, motivated individuals such as Allen and Mark Cuban. This had advantages and drawbacks, but either way, the owner’s connection to the franchise and its success was personal.\n\nAs the cost of entry soars into the billions, though, corporations are going to start to take over where individuals once ruled. The obsession will shift away from prestige and winning towards efficiency and the bottom line. That could spell disaster for a small-market franchise like Portland.\n\nWhenever the Blazers are moved, let’s hope they fall into the hands of someone who cares rather than the Executive Vice President of Sports and Marketing in some investment firm, simply looking to run the project for financial leverage. Call me stupid, but I’ll take a billionaire cowboy over an umbrella organization every time.",
      "# [This Tiny $2k Computer is Nuts by Nostalgia Nerd on 2025-01-05](https://www.nostalgianerd.com/this-tiny-2k-computer-is-nuts/)\nTHIS is the Vulcan Flipstart. Also an Ultra Mobile PC, but nobody really knows about this one. Which is strange, because frankly. This thing IS NUTS.\n\nWe’ll get to the details of that in a bit, but first, LIKE EVERY DAMN VIDEO ON THIS CHANNEL, Let’s rewind to the early noughties. A time when tech was getting smaller and smaller, as opposed to absolutely mammoth like today’s world of tech playing Tonka toy. God I loved things like my lil’ Nokia 7210i… and one person who also loved it and indeed, wanted to capitalise on shrinking tech was Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.\n\nAllen wasn’t alien to new ventures. In 1986 he founded Vulcan Inc. to oversee his family’s business activities and philanthropic endeavours. In 1992 he co-founded Interval Research Corporation, a silicon valley new business incubator that generated over 300 patents, including some which he would later sue Apple, eBay, Facebook, Google, Netflix and Office Depot to name a few for violating.\n\nIn November 1993, he acquired 80% of Ticketmaster. In 1997 he purchased National Football League’s Seattle Seahawks, and in 1998 he purchased Seattle’s historic Cinerama Theatre, quickly upgrading it to 3D capability…. and that’s just naming a few of his business side quests.\n\nSo, it’s no surprise that with various companies having jumped on the Ultra-Mobile PC Market, including the infamous Toshiba Libretto, Allen would like to get involved in that, especially given his ties to Microsoft.\n\nPreviewed at the 2003 Consumer Electronics Show with the code name Mini-PC and then First showcased in February at Seattle’s 2004 DEMO Trade Show, the same show that had launched the original Palm Pilot back in 1996, the idea was simple; create a fully functioning Windows XP machine but in handheld form, and it certainly got the media’s attention.\n\nBut this wasn’t the first computer of this type of be announced; The Tiqit eightythree was showcased two years prior at the Planet PDA Technology show in Boston, the OQO Ultra Personal Computer had been announced in 2001 and was due out later in 2004 along with the then called Sony VGN-U50, sans keyboard.\n\nWhat made the Vulcan FlipStart different was really the name behind it; Paul Allen. Given all these machines were going to run Windows XP, it seemed like the FlipStart should really be the one ahead of the game.\n\nHowever, ahead started to feel like behind when it took a further 3 years before the FlipStart was actually launched, with the first units shipping on 27th March 2007. Here’s how they arrived, which I’m going to unbox as I explain the fact that in between its announcement and launch a lot changed, politics, the world, tech, the manufacture process of Pears soap, everything. Which meant some of FlipStarts specs also changed.\n\nOriginal specs detailed a 5.8x4x1 inch size, just under a pound in weight, 2-6 hours battery life, 20GB Hard Drive, 256MB of RAM, a 5.6 inch HDTV quality display, and a Transmeta Crusoe CPU.\n\nThe actual size came in a bit more at 5.9×4.5×1.6, with an extra half pound in weight. That might not sound a lot, but it makes a significant difference in a handheld device. However, double the amount of RAM, a 30 Gig drive, 1.1GHz Intel Pentium M processor and 64MB Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 900 try their best to make up for that.\n\nEven said, the FlipStart was now entering a world where literal pocket sized devices like the BlackBerry were common in business and where the first iPhone was starting its domination of the rest of the mobile world. Even Windows XP had been succeeded, by Windows Vista, although really…. that wasn’t much of a problem.\n\nRoger Kay, president of Endpoint technologies commented on the FlipStart’s launch;\n\n“The only people who will want that is someone with a tremendous demand for mobility and isn’t compromised by a lack of a fully functional set, they might sell a few as executive jewellery, but they won’t sell any more.”\n\nBut Allen was still very much convinced in it’s potential; “Years ago, I began to imagine a super compact computer that would allow us to connect, communicate, work and relax, no matter where we are — one that is intrinsically intuitive to use. FlipStart is the first commercial product to meet that vision; it simply works as expected.”\n\nThe FlipStart Itself\n\nAs you can see, we got a lot in the box. A Quick Start Guide, manual, battery, headphones, a lil’ dock like thing, a case, AC adapter, a crap load of cardboard, and of course, the FlipStart itself.\n\nFirst things first, we have to connect the battery. As standard you actually get the chunky version that gives up to 6 hours life, or at least, it may have 17 years ago. Christ, 17 years, it’s old enough to drive. We can then plug the AC adapter in, and BOOM, we have life. Windows XP life. Well after it boots. Honestly, seeing a standard PC boot screen on something like this is just so weird to me.\n\nOne thing you recognise right away is the absolute build quality of this thing. It feels like some kind of nuclear grade military tech. Like it would win in a game of Chicken with a Nokia 3310. It’s just so robust and firm feeling.\n\nIt also feels immediately weird to be using Windows, even XP, on a device so small, and that’s not just because we’ve largely abandoned devices like this, but it’s also because, well, this feels like a desktop computer, but it’s tiny. The screen being crisp, the mouse tracking definite, plus the fact it weighs about the same as a desktop PC all help to give it that larger than life feel. Its almost a little uncanny.\n\nSo the FlipStart feels like a big PC in some ways, but the brains behind Vulcan knew that this very much wasn’t a full size PC, so we’ve got a number of features to help us cope with the change in scale a bit better.\n\nYou’ll note the trackpad is over on the right, with the mouse buttons over on the left. This works pretty well, especially as the pad can be tapped and scrolled like a modern day trackpad. But if you don’t fancy tracking, we’ve got one of those noughties nubs that people got into for a while. They’re an acquired taste, but you can use it to fling the mouse cursor across the screen rapidly. Next to the pad you’ll notice a discrete CTRL-ALT-DELETE button, which is considerate, and the arrow keys.\n\nBottom left, there are a couple of new buttons. This one brings up the dedicated FlipStart menu, which allows you to jump to files and common organisation programs. The zoom button here is especially useful, as it resizes the window you’re currently using to good effect, you can then scroll about if needed. Press it again, and you’re back to normal. Neat.\n\nStandard media controls at the bottom, then over on the right is essentially an ALT-TAB button, allowing you to flip between applications, and a desktop button which, well, gives you the desktop. These are all very useful features, especially in the XP era.\n\nBut how does it function?\n\nLet’s start with the keyboard. I mean, it’s not ideal. I’m sure you could get used to it, in the same way you get used to a ZX80 keyboard, but it’s more suited for thumb typing. The only problem is, you need pretty large hands to use it in that way, rendering it a little tricky for typing. Compared to the Libretto, which had essentially a proper mini keyboard, the FlipStart lags behind\n\nBut for general Windows operation, it’s pretty great. All you really need to do is connect up a full size keyboard, and maybe a monitor, and well, then it’s really not a handheld computer anymore, BUT the fact you can do these things makes it versatile. However we need the right ports for that.\n\nOn the front there, we’ve got our standard indicator lights, on the right we’ve got a jog button, a headphone jack and some media buttons on the lid for use when its shut. The rear reveals one USB 2, a power in, an expansion port and a little heat sink vent which pours out some pretty warm air. Oh, we also have a little screen on the top which gives access to emails and the like when you don’t want to open it up. You can navigate using that jog button on the side. Pretty good for conserving battery life. Plus if you have an American version you can put a SIM card in here and connect up to your mobile network.\n\nIf you’re wondering about that expansion slot, that’s where the Port Replicator plugs in. Giving us a VGA out, speaker out, ethernet and two USBs. It’s kinda like a mini dock, and allows us to go into that FULL productivity mode.\n\nHell yeah, this thing is pumping out 1280×1024 on our new monitor, along with 1024×600 on it’s own screen with no sweat. Alright, maybe a little bit, but LOOK AT THIS SIZE OF IT. It’s nuts. You can push the build in screen up to 1024×768 if you really want, but then you just have to scroll about. There’s no need the standard resolution is decent and looks sharp as a pin.\n\nAlright screw productivity, let’s try and play some games on this thing.\n\nYou know it kinda works, out of the box, the FlipStart shipped with a Quake 3 demo, to show what it’s really made of, and why not, it works pretty well for most games.\n\nThe only times I ran into trouble were trying to use these little arrow keys to games which are very much geared up to use standard arrow keys. Crazy Taxi is a bit of a pain.\n\nOh, also you’re not going to get far in Typing of the Dead on this thing.\n\nBut it’s great. It’s almost like a lil Steam Deck, well ahead of its time. I can see many an exec getting in a quick blast on Grand Theft Auto on a lunch break. Pop some headphones on and who’s gonna know?\n\nHonestly, it’s a shame this didn’t sell better, because it’s both a crazy and incredibly professional bit of kit, and I can see why they’re so sought after today.\n\nWrong Timing?\n\nHowever, the FlipStart witnessed a slow uptake, with it’s US price slashed by $500 just 6 months after launch. By January 2008, it was down to $699, or just £339 in the UK, and by the middle of the year, all initial units had sold out, with Vulcan downing tools and making no more. With all warranties expiring a year later, support was withdrawn and the FlipStart faded into obscurity.\n\nThe FlipStart felt like something that people wanted. It felt like something that could fit in pockets and be useful. But it was just a little too big and bulky for that, and if you’re going to carry something around, you might as well make it a more usable laptop, especially given you could get more bang for your buck.\n\nRoger Kay it seems was right, it was jewellery, a gadget, a cool toy to show off, with very few practical uses, and weirdly enough that’s exactly what it remains. Unless of course you want to just use it as a very expensive and rare XP gaming handheld. Then, go for your life.\n\nPaul Allen fulfilled his tiny computer dream, and in many ways it was a great success. It does everything that he set out for it to do, and it does it well. It’s just the market wasn’t there for it. It was going in the opposite direction, and in just a few years we’d all be playing with whopping great ipads. It’s a shame really, because tiny tech like this, really is cool as hell.\n\nSo there we go, that’s the Vulcan Flipstart ultra mobile PC. What a fantastic piece of kit from the past. It’s also about to go on my eBay shop, which has just re-opened! So if you want to pick this up, or anything else, follow the link below and see what you find!\n\nUntil next time, I’ve been Nostalgia Nerd, Toodleoo.\n\n“TOSHIBA LIBRETTTTO, why do you come to myy barrrr?….

      "# [Paul Allen's Historic Computers Under the Hammer by Sue Gee](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/82-heritage/17430-paul-allens-enigma-machine-under-the-hammer.html)\nDozens of rare historic computers are currently up for auction. As well as a room-sized PDP 7, there's an Altair, an Apple I, a Cray I and an Enigma machine on offer to the highest bidder as the private collection of the late Paul Allen, is sold by Christies, New York.\n\nAs well as being co-founder of Microsoft with Bill Gates, the duo responsible for bringing BASIC to the home computer, specifically the Altair 8800, Paul Allen was an avid collector. During his lifetime he had amassed not only historic computers and notable technology, but also artworks and precious artefacts of all kinds.\n\nAllen was also a philanthropist who supported the arts, music, sport, science and technology. After resigning from Microsoft in 1983, he set up Vulcan Inc. in 1986 as an investment and project management firm with his sister, Jody Allen and two years later established the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation to oversee his philanthropic venture. Now, nearly six years after his death in October 2018, from complications of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a disease he was first diagnosed with in 1982, items from his private collection are being sold to further his philanthropic mission.\n\nIn fact the number of items is so large, so varied and so valuable that Christies has split them across three sales. The collective title for the sales is \"Gen One: Innovations from the Paul G. Allen Collection\" and expectations are high given that in 2022 a previous auction titled \"Visionary: The Paul G. Allen Collection\" and comprising 155 art masterpieces achieved $1.62 billion, becoming the most valuable private collection ever to come to auction. The artworks now going on sale are in one of the two online auctions that started on August 23rd and finishes on September 12th. As it's title, \"Over the Horizon: Art of the Future from the Paul G. Allen Collection\" suggest, works in the 57 lots are devoted to how the future, especially interplanetary travel, was imagined by artists and other thinkers during the 20th century including Chesley Bonestell, Robert McCall, R.C. Swanson, George Gibbs, and Fred Freeman. According to Christies:\n\nThe artworks in this auction, along with their publication in popular magazines, inspired a generation of explorers, scientists, and aerospace engineers.\n\nThe concurrent online auction is Firsts: The History of Computing from the Paul G. Allen Collection which Christies claim:\n\npresents important milestones in the history of computing, some of which have been preserved in working order\n\nThe 58 lots in this sale comprises the bulk of the contents of the Living Computers, the Seattle-based museum, which Paul Allen founded in 2012 to display his growing collection of historic computers and have them restored to working order and maintained by a team of engineers. In this video posted by Christies, Stephen Jones, Senior Restoration & Collection Manager, Living Computers sets the scene and introduces some of the historic computers that he used to be responsible for, presenting a timeline that highlights the breakthroughs in technology that the machines represent.\n\nAs reported in Paul Allen's Living Computer Museum Going, Going, Gone Living Computers had been forced to close to the public by the pandemic 2020. It never re-opened much to the disappointment of those who appreciated Paul Allen's aim of preserving vintage and heritage computers for posterity. One aficionado, Seattle-area tech veteran, Paolo Tosolini, founder of Tosolini Productions, had done a high-tech 3D photo scans of Living Computers and later created a more detailed scan of the first and second floors. Now, using technology from the 3D-capture platform Matterport, interactive “hot spots” have been added to 16 items that are up for auction, including the PDP 7 and the Apple 1 with links to lot details at Chrisitie's.\n\nClick on image to go to the Virtual Tour of LCM and see how Paul Allen's collection told the history of computing.\n\nWhile the online auction a mix of huge and small items, from the PDP 7 to mercury delay line memory from the Remington Rand Univac, the gems of the LMC collection are included in the \"live auction, \"Pushing Boundaries: Ingenuity from the Paul G. Allen Collection, taking place at Christies Rockefeller Center galleries in New York on September with viewing open from September 6-9. It comprises 36 lots, including Einstein’s letter to President Roosevelt which propelled the US into the nuclear age and crucial artifacts from the Space Race, including astronaut Ed White’s spacesuit cover layer, the pilot’s in-flight logbook from Apollo 8, and an annotated checklist from the first American spacewalk in June 1965.\n\nThe historic computers included in the sale all have important stories. The MITS Altair 8800 is as Christie's state:\n\nThe first commercially successful personal computer, which catalysed the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s.\n\nMore importantly for Paul Allen it was the machine for which he and Bill Gates, when they were 22 and 20 years old respectively, created a BASIC interpreter, to know more about this and how it led to the formation of Microsoft, see articles in our History section.\n\nWhile Apple Is are rare, the one included in the sale, with an estimate of $500,000-800,00 is unique. Around 200 units were originally produced and one of these was retained by the company probably to be used a as demo unit. As explained in the lot details this machine was removed from its place in Jobs’ office in 1985 by Don Hutmacher after Steve Jobs was dismissed from Apple and engineers were allowed to take items from his office. Hutchmacher's Apple security pass is included in the lot.\n\nBy way of Apple I memorabilia, the auction also includes a lot comprising two typed letters, the first of which dated 5 November 1976, is signed twice by Steve Jobs and has apologetic annotation in his handwriting. Its estimate is $50,000–80,000.\n\nThere's also an Enigma Machine. We've covered the auction of several of these over the years, seeing them realize from $100,000 upwards. This one is a four-rotor model, manufactured by Heimsoeth & Rinke in 1941 and has an estimate of $250,000-350,000.\n\nAnother lot that caught my eye is an IBM 360/91 console, which according to Chrisitie's:\n\nstands as a testament to the advanced technology of its era, representing the height of the System/360 line and offering a rare glimpse into the computing innovations of the 1960s.\n\nHaving been owned by Princeton University and exhibited by Walt Disney Picture in Tomorrowland in 2015, this example was restored at Living Computers. Having had new circuitry added, the console:\n\nnow includes an animated display demonstrating its operation, complete with a playful light show currently programmed where Pac-Man chases a ghost, adding a touch of modern whimsy to its historical significance.\n\nMoving forward a decade there is a Cray-1 Supercomputer. Only around 80 units were ever built and this one, Serial Number 12 was purchased in 1981 by the University of Minnesota and was designed to match UMN colors. After being decommissioned it was used as a sales model for Cray Research Inc. Only 17 Cray-1s are thought to survive and this is the first to come to auction with an estimate of USD 150,000 – USD 250,000.\n\nThere's a decommissioned Cray-2 in the online auction with an estimate of USD 150,000 – USD 250,000, but as yet no bid has yet been placed. One does have to wonder who has deep enough pockets and sufficient spare room to afford to win such an item. Although the computers are indeed important milestones in the history of computing they can also be seen as white elephants - expensive to maintain and a big responsibility due to their rarity.\n\nAs Stephen Jones points out in the video Living Computers was:\n\n\"a grand collection of restored machines, some of the most important milestones in the history of computing\"\n\nwhich Paul Allen had put together to inspire the next generation of technologists. Even though all the proceeds of the sales are destined for charitable causes, the idea that this collection is being dispersed, with much of it disappearing from public view, comes as a great disappointment to people, including those who had donated their computers to preserve them for posterity and to make them accessible to future generations.\n\nMore Information\n\nGen One: Innovations from the Paul G.

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on Vulcan Inc.\n\n## Company Overview\n\nVulcan Inc. was founded in 1986 by Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, and his sister, Jody Allen, to manage his business and philanthropic endeavors. The company operates as a privately held entity, overseeing a diverse portfolio that includes technology investments, real estate development, and various philanthropic initiatives. Paul Allen was a prominent figure in technology and philanthropy, known for his significant contributions to various fields, including science, arts, and sports, until his passing in 2018 [(Paul Allen by Contributors to Wikimedia projects, 2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen).\n\n## Financial and Investment Activities\n\nVulcan Capital, the investment arm of Vulcan Inc., focuses on emerging technology and internet companies. In 2013, it expanded its operations by opening an office in Palo Alto, California [(Paul Allen by Contributors to Wikimedia projects, 2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen). The company has a history of significant investments, including acquiring 80% of Ticketmaster in 1993 and a controlling interest in Charter Communications in 1998, although the latter resulted in substantial losses during its bankruptcy reorganization in 2009 [(Paul Allen by Contributors to Wikimedia projects, 2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen).\n\n## Philanthropic Efforts\n\nPaul Allen was known for his philanthropic contributions, having donated over $2 billion to various causes, including education, wildlife conservation, and healthcare [(Paul Allen by Contributors to Wikimedia projects, 2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen). The Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, established to manage his philanthropic activities, has provided over $494 million to more than 1,500 nonprofits [(Paul Allen by Contributors to Wikimedia projects, 2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen).\n\n## Major Projects and Initiatives\n\nVulcan Inc. has been involved in several notable projects, including the development of the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle and the Flying Heritage Collection, which showcases restored military aircraft [(Paul Allen by Contributors to Wikimedia projects, 2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen). The company also played a role in the redevelopment of the South Lake Union neighborhood in Seattle, which has been described as \"unexpectedly lucrative\" due to its significant real estate transactions, including a $1.16 billion sale of an office complex to Amazon [(Paul Allen by Contributors to Wikimedia projects, 2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen).\n\n## Product Development: Vulcan FlipStart\n\nOne of the notable products developed under Vulcan Inc. is the Vulcan FlipStart, an ultra-mobile PC that was first showcased in 2004 and launched in 2007. The FlipStart aimed to provide a fully functional Windows XP experience in a compact form factor. Despite its innovative design, it struggled to gain market traction, leading to a price reduction shortly after launch and eventual discontinuation [(Nostalgia Nerd, 2025)](https://www.nostalgianerd.com/this-tiny-2k-computer-is-nuts/).\n\nPaul Allen expressed his vision for the FlipStart, stating, \"Years ago, I began to imagine a super compact computer that would allow us to connect, communicate, work and relax, no matter where we are\" [(Nostalgia Nerd, 2025)](https://www.nostalgianerd.com/this-tiny-2k-computer-is-nuts/). However, the product faced challenges in a rapidly evolving tech landscape, where smaller, more powerful devices were becoming the norm.\n\n## Company Scale and Employee Count\n\nAs of the latest available information, Vulcan Inc. operates with a relatively small team, focusing on high-impact projects rather than large-scale operations. The company has been involved in various sectors, including technology, real estate, and philanthropy, but specific employee counts are not publicly disclosed [(Paul Allen by Contributors to Wikimedia projects, 2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen).\n\n## Leadership and Executive Insights\n\nFollowing Paul Allen's death in 2018, Jody Allen has taken on a significant role in managing Vulcan Inc. and its various initiatives. The company continues to uphold Allen's legacy through its ongoing projects and philanthropic efforts [(Paul Allen by Contributors to Wikimedia projects, 2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen).\n\n## Recent Developments and Future Outlook\n\nIn recent years, Vulcan Inc. has continued to focus on its philanthropic mission and investment strategies. The company has been involved in the auctioning of Paul Allen's extensive collection of historic computers and artworks, with proceeds aimed at supporting charitable causes [(Sue Gee, 2023)](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/82-heritage/17430-paul-allens-enigma-machine-under-the-hammer.html). The future of Vulcan Inc. appears to be aligned with continuing Allen's vision of impactful philanthropy and innovative investments.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVulcan Inc. stands as a testament to Paul Allen's multifaceted legacy, encompassing technology, philanthropy, and cultural contributions. While the company has faced challenges, particularly with product launches like the FlipStart, its ongoing initiatives and investments reflect a commitment to innovation and social impact. Prospective candidates and investors should consider Vulcan Inc.'s unique position in the market and its potential for future growth in various sectors."
