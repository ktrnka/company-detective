      "# Post ID 11ss3vs: Qualtrics alternatives? with +12 score by [(hello_kitteh, Reddit, 2023-03-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/)\nAny recommendations for Qualtrics alternatives?\n\nAs many of you may know, Qualtrics has recently gotten rid of their Research/Academia license and is moving everyone over to the CoreXM license. This license is built for business and has lots of analytics bells and whistles that are useless for research, and it also costs over double the annual subscription cost.\n\nMy SLAC is having a hard time justifying this price hike, so we're looking at alternative platforms.  We need something on par with Qualtrics in terms of question and output types, and the ability to have custom branding would be ideal (i.e. I don't want participants to be redirected to a random SurveyMonkey page after completing the survey).\n\nFor comparison, a site-wide license (unlimited responses) for my college with ~1200 students used to be $7500/year. Now it is limited to 1000 users and 25,000 responses for $15,000/year. We have been able to negotiate both of these prices down a little, but we're still looking at a $5k increase for more-restricted usage.\n\n## Comment ID jfqm2cy with +2 score by [(cequims, Reddit, 2023-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/jfqm2cy/) (in reply to ID 11ss3vs):\nJust got off the phone with our Qualtrics rep, and it's clear they have no interest in serving small businesses. They want to more or less double our license cost. I last did my research on different survey platforms about a year ago, and at that time I liked [Survey Sparrow](https://www.surveysparrow.com), so check them out.\n\n### Comment ID ke5j3n0 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/ke5j3n0/) (in reply to ID jfqm2cy):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID kxp1oz9 with +1 score by [(cequims, Reddit, 2024-04-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/kxp1oz9/) (in reply to ID ke5j3n0):\nSorry for the slow reply - I don't get on Reddit much. So far, I'm pretty happy with SurveySparrow. The features are sufficiently complex for just about everything our company needs to do across our many projects. The question options aren't as customizable as Qualtrics, and the automated reports could use a few improvements, but for the drastically lower cost I am happy to make adjustments to work with the available options. I will say that customer service is a bit spotty. They are often (but not always) available right away via their chat feature. I think most of their team is located in India, however, and sometimes time zone differences are an issue. My colleague on Pacific time tends says they often don't get back to her til the next day. I'm on East Coast time, and it's less of an issue. I also sometimes worry that because they are a smaller company, they may be less stable and more likely to have tech issues. For example, I once found that I couldn't edit data on the back end, then the next day it worked. And right now, there's a weird formatting issue where text is overlapping in the footer of the surveys. So there are definitely small signs that they are more scrappy than the big leagues. But our team of about 16 employees has been using it for about 10 months now, and it hasn't held us back.\n\n## Comment ID kzw0jm1 with +1 score by [(Spiritual-Dance-562, Reddit, 2024-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/kzw0jm1/) (in reply to ID 11ss3vs):\nQualtrics is clearly trying to eliminate small businesses.

Plus, as opposed to Qualtrics, Survicate is a small company that understands and values all of its customers, so surely you'd be able to get a good deal. One thing they also offer that's great for research is AI analysis - really speeds up analyzing open-ended responses.\n\n## Comment ID l9bmfin with +1 score by [(Mohawk200x, Reddit, 2024-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/l9bmfin/) (in reply to ID 11ss3vs):\nBest one yet is [SmartSurvey](https://www.smartsurvey.com), easy to use and no nonesense.

For my Psych 220 online course, I need to do a research project. I have submitted my proposal and got approved, and the next step is to create a survey with very specific questions included, and send it out to as many adults as possible.\n\nHere's my question: how do we register to create a Qualtrics survey using BYU credentials? According to their academic solutions page on the Qualtrics website, all BYU faculty and students are entitled to a Qualtrics account, but I can't get my BYU account to work. Does anyone know why it doesn't work, and how I could get it to do I could create this survey?\nConversely, does anyone know any real alternatives to Qualtrics for data collection? I've looked into Microsoft Forms and Google Forms, but they don't break the data up the same way as Qualtrics.\n\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks\n\n## Comment ID lr8v2kr with +6 score by [(Accurate-Company-475, Reddit, 2024-10-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/1g0erey/qualtrics_survey_creation/lr8v2kr/) (in reply to ID 1g0erey):\nJust Google BYU qualtrics.

      "# Post ID 11ss012: Qualtrics alternatives? with +29 score by [(hello_kitteh, Reddit, 2023-03-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/11ss012/qualtrics_alternatives/)\nAny recommendations for Qualtrics alternatives?\n\nAs many of you may know, Qualtrics has recently gotten rid of their Research/Academia license and is moving everyone over to the CoreXM license. This license is built for business and has lots of analytics bells and whistles that are useless for research, and it also costs over double the annual subscription cost.\n\nMy SLAC is having a hard time justifying this price hike, so we're looking at alternative platforms.  We need something on par with Qualtrics in terms of question and output types, and the ability to have custom branding would be ideal (i.e. I don't want participants to be redirected to a random SurveyMonkey page after completing the survey).\n\nFor comparison, a site-wide license (unlimited responses) for my college with ~1200 students used to be $7500/year. Now it is limited to 1000 users and 25,000 responses for $15,000/year. We have been able to negotiate both of these prices down a little, but we're still looking at a $5k increase for more-restricted usage.\n\n## Comment ID jcinizm with +7 score by [(cattyditty, Reddit, 2023-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/11ss012/qualtrics_alternatives/jcinizm/) (in reply to ID 11ss012):\nREDCap!

I have a bunch of kids who participate in ice sports at the Oval and the team's treatment of the youth there is outrageous. Players do not say hello back to the children nor even smile at them. I have had staff tell me to not let my very young child \"look\" at the players during a practice in a very public place where they are the guest (until South Towne Mall practice facility is ready). Staff and players speed through the parking lot after dark when many young children are coming and going for their sports. They have the walking track blocked off nearly daily for no reason at all, making that unusable to patrons. \n\nI was also a little taken aback by the ticket prices for the games.

If they were to move in Draper then what is going to fill the hole in downtown? \n\nNobody goes to that end of the city, no restaurants no bars, nothing. You got a convention center that can easily be condensed or stacked. SL is the most realistic scenario for that type of set up.

By the time the break-even point is approached, suddenly the stadium/arena needs major upgrades and can't possibly be done without even more public money and if the city doesn't pay up they'll relocate. Repeat ad nauseam.\n\nAll of the \"studies\" that show how much local revenue and jobs are generated by these things ignore that the vast majority of that money would be spent locally anyway, because the vast majority of people attending the events are the local population. The number of jobs they say are generated counts short-term construction jobs as equally valuable as long-term staff but once the thing is built those construction jobs go away.\n\n## Comment ID lohfdie with +1 score by [(georgiaviking, Reddit, 2024-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/1fn6wel/just_got_this_survey_from_qualtrics_about_ryan/lohfdie/) (in reply to ID 1fn6wel):\nfucking tool\n\n## Comment ID loj0n67 with +1 score by [(GnawPhoReal, Reddit, 2024-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/1fn6wel/just_got_this_survey_from_qualtrics_about_ryan/loj0n67/) (in reply to ID 1fn6wel):\nIt's as if they want to receive a certain answer 🤔\n\n## Comment ID lojddj0 with +1 score by [(AcheronK, Reddit, 2024-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/1fn6wel/just_got_this_survey_from_qualtrics_about_ryan/lojddj0/) (in reply to ID 1fn6wel):\nDog whistle\n\n## Comment ID lojf510 with +1 score by [(AdditionalTime8303, Reddit, 2024-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/1fn6wel/just_got_this_survey_from_qualtrics_about_ryan/lojf510/) (in reply to ID 1fn6wel):\nRyan Smith can fuck off\n\n## Comment ID lojjews with +1 score by [(rabid_briefcase, Reddit, 2024-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/1fn6wel/just_got_this_survey_from_qualtrics_about_ryan/lojjews/) (in reply to ID 1fn6wel):\nTagging /u/QualtricsXMCMTY -- Any thoughts or comments to why the company is using such an obviously biased question in their own surveys?\n\n## Comment ID lojvc08 with +1 score by [(RockMan7733, Reddit, 2024-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/1fn6wel/just_got_this_survey_from_qualtrics_about_ryan/lojvc08/) (in reply to ID 1fn6wel):\nWhat awful push polling.

The number of surveys I've done that lack page breaks is astounding. Seeing more than about 10 questions on a single page is overwhelming for most people and increases your chances of accidentally skipped questions.\n\nFor question matrices with Likert scale items, ensure that the labels for the response options appear at the top and the middle of the matrix (not just the top). You can change this in question settings. This will help to ensure that respondents don't have to keep scrolling to the top of the page to see the the response options. People will forget what the response options are, especially if you have a larger number of response options. \n\nSet the questions to \"request response\". This will flag skipped questions for participants so they are asked if they want to continue the survey without answering a skipped question. This doesn't work for matrices though.\n\nUse multie blocks as you're setting up your survey. For example, if you have demographics questions, mental health questions, and substance use questions, put all of your demographics questions in one block, your mental health questions in second block, and your substance use questions in a third block.  This is for YOUR sake. It's easier to find/edit/move questions when you have multipe blocks rather than what could be 100+ questions placed into a single block. Using multipe blocks also makes setting up survey flow and skip logic more effective/efficient.\n\n## Comment ID ljzodjv with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-08-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/ljzodjv/) (in reply to ID 101qloz):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID lkbuqjj with +1 score by [(barrybulsara, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/lkbuqjj/) (in reply to ID ljzodjv):\n/u/Odd-Courage- is a bot account.\n\n## Comment ID lk4rvn9 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/lk4rvn9/) (in reply to ID 101qloz):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID lkbuj74 with +1 score by [(barrybulsara, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/lkbuj74/) (in reply to ID lk4rvn9):\n/u/Odd-Courage- is a bot account.\n\n## Comment ID j2qfltq with +1 score by [(Decent-Reception-232, Reddit, 2023-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/j2qfltq/) (in reply to ID 101qloz):\n1.

CV entitlements are included with D365 (so free or cheap for D365 shops). MS Office has Forms, so a souped-up version became CV. If you want the best of breed point solution in this area, qualtrics or a medallia is a better fit. With the complexities MS needs across all its customer base, CV prob doesn't check the boxes.\n\n## Comment ID kv2uzp8 with +1 score by [(365LYF-MVP, Reddit, 2024-03-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dynamics365/comments/1befomj/just_got_a_survey_from_microsoft_that_is_powered/kv2uzp8/) (in reply to ID 1befomj):\nNope, it’s still around on life support, but each time my customers have brought it up the response has been to consider third party products (make of that what you will).\n\nI wrote a comparison article on alternatives :\nhttp://365lyf.com/overview-of-third-party-form-builder-voice-of-customer-applications-that-integrate-with-dynamics-365-power-platform/\n\n### Comment ID kv67dor with +1 score by [(Fennek1237, Reddit, 2024-03-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dynamics365/comments/1befomj/just_got_a_survey_from_microsoft_that_is_powered/kv67dor/) (in reply to ID kv2uzp8):\n> it’s still around on life support,\n\nAre you sure about that? They just did a lot of work / renaming all the products. Forms, Forms Pro, Customer Voice, what ever it is now. I would have thought that there was still a lot going on. The integration into Dynamics 365 / data verse is also not bad. You get all the survey answers into dynamics and can use it from there directly. No need to integrate any 3rd Party.\n\n#### Comment ID kv6qt0j with +1 score by [(365LYF-MVP, Reddit, 2024-03-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dynamics365/comments/1befomj/just_got_a_survey_from_microsoft_that_is_powered/kv6qt0j/) (in reply to ID kv67dor):\nYes this is non-nda information now, I’ve heard this from several Microsoft account managers, and product team members.  You can still purchase licensing for it upon request but there is no further active investment in the product (D365 Customer Voice that is, not speaking about Forms).\n\n## Comment ID kuu6u20 with +1 score by [(wizdomeleven, Reddit, 2024-03-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dynamics365/comments/1befomj/just_got_a_survey_from_microsoft_that_is_powered/kuu6u20/) (in reply to ID 1befomj):\nI did a comparison of the products, and qualtrics had a number of question types that voice doesn't support, as well as showing results to survey users as questions were answered. Voice has much better customer data integration, and is a no Brainer for D365 Shops. Also qualtrics has punishing pricing"

          "advice": "Don’t risk selling long-term competitive advantages and strategic value differentiators for short-term ROI and immediate profit margins. Qualtrics’ platform is ripe for disruption if we do not stay at the bleeding edge of emerging technology. To do this, Silver Lake, ELT, and the board need to be willing to invest heavily in the people that make this business special. Qualtrics had the rise that it did (and created generational wealth for many people, especially much of the board and the leadership team) because of the hard work of a mission-driven team. If Qualtrics is going to do this again and hit 10X or 100X value multiples and become a generational SaaS company, issues with employee engagement and retention of top talent need to be addressed immediately. Here is what I would recommend: 1. Qualtrics needs to rebuild a culture of trust and collaboration, and that has to be driven through transparency and accountability at the very top. If leaders signal that they trust employees and want them to succeed, employees will trust leadership to guide them. 2. Invest heavily in systems, processes, and people. Qualtrics has significant needs for enterprise systems that work together (for example, the CRM and HRIS are poorly integrated with the other systems that they rely on). The new promotion philosophy makes sense from a cost-saving standpoint, but Qualtrics should not be cost-saving if that means we’re losing top talent that would deliver outsized value in the future. 3. Reconnect employees with the values and the mission that made this company “bigger than itself”. Becoming a top SaaS company is not motivating to the vast majority of employees if they have only marginal incentives for achieving that goal. Qualtrics’ investors and the board either needs share a much greater portion of the equity and give employees much more lucrative LTI for the financial success of the business, OR leadership needs to develop a culture that prioritizes CSR and the collective good Qualtrics can provide the world and the communities in which we operate. The company needs to do more than simply matching employee contributions to 5fortheFight. How will Qualtrics support vulnerable and marginalized people? Promote equitable, fair, inclusive, and just policies in the community? Protect the environment? How will Qualtrics be a force for good? Demonstrating good stewardship and social governance through corporate action will make Qualtrics an employer and a brand that employees and customers can be proud of.",

          "cons": "“Fast-paced growth SaaS company” also means major organizational changes are constant; the change fatigue is real and can be a lot to manage at times (I have been with Q for 7 years and have been through at least as many re-orgs). Recent layoffs (October 2023) have dampened moral and eroded trust in the exec leadership team, but it seems like the culture is rebounding. The hybrid work policy is not for everyone. There is a significant lack of diversity amongst the leadership team- you will see women and underrepresented minorities in the executive team, but the core group of decision makers (the Founder &amp; Board Chairman, CEO, COO, Chief Product Officer, President, many sales leaders) are all white men from Provo, Utah. Since being taken private again, Qualtrics’ promotion philosophy has become much more conservative and there are fewer opportunities for accelerated advancement compared to what you might find at a pre-IPO startup. The private equity firm that owns Q is heavily focused on profit margins, which may risk product development when many competitors are investing heavily in R&amp;D for AI.",

Change is constant, so there are lots of opportunities for making a meaningful impact on the success of the business. The pay is competitive in most markets for most roles, and the benefits are fantastic. 401k match, equity options, STI and LTI, lunches in most offices. The performance expectations are aggressive, but the bonuses are equally aggressive- exceptional work is recognized and rewarded here. It takes a lot to be exceptional with the kind of peers we have at Qualtrics, but I would rather deliver average work at this company than be a star performer some place else. The best part is the people that work here- there is a high bar for hiring and this place is filled with talented, motivated, intelligent, and empathetic people. The frontline managers and middle managers are generally very good and they care deeply about the success of their teams and their people. The leadership team is committed and competent (most have been with the company for years).",

Big layoffs recently, many jobs moved to lower cost locations and other countries, no leadership accountability whatsoever. Total chaos followed. RTO enforcement coming. Pay cuts (or absence of refreshers) likely coming. Everyone good is looking to leave soon. Product is also incredibly boring to work on although I don't personally mind as long as working hours stay low. Not a single person in the C-suite deserves to be there. They are driving the company away from being a survey platform (which we excel at) to being a management suggestion tool (which we're bad at and customers don't need). They set on this path when the economy was good, and many customers were shelling out for a luxury product and making decisions based on employee and customer feedback. But now that the tech economy is bad, decision making is driven only by profit, making Qualtrics' experience management insights irrelevant. For example, Qualtrics can tell Delta that customers want extra leg room on flights. But Delta doesn't care, they need the money from those 3 extra rows. It is a rare case when Qualtrics can provide an insight that 1.) is novel and 2.) is actionable in a profitable way.",

Big layoffs recently, many jobs moved to lower cost locations and other countries, no leadership accountability whatsoever. Total chaos followed. RTO enforcement coming. Pay cuts (or absence of refreshers) likely coming. Everyone good is looking to leave soon. Product is also incredibly boring to work on although I don't personally mind as long as working hours stay low. Not a single person in the C-suite deserves to be there. They are driving the company away from being a survey platform (which we excel at) to being a management suggestion tool (which we're bad at and customers don't need). They set on this path when the economy was good, and many customers were shelling out for a luxury product and making decisions based on employee and customer feedback. But now that the tech economy is bad, decision making is driven only by profit, making Qualtrics' experience management insights irrelevant. For example, Qualtrics can tell Delta that customers want extra leg room on flights. But Delta doesn't care, they need the money from those 3 extra rows. It is a rare case when Qualtrics can provide an insight that 1.) is novel and 2.) is actionable in a profitable way.",

        "advice": "Don’t risk selling long-term competitive advantages and strategic value differentiators for short-term ROI and immediate profit margins. Qualtrics’ platform is ripe for disruption if we do not stay at the bleeding edge of emerging technology. To do this, Silver Lake, ELT, and the board need to be willing to invest heavily in the people that make this business special. Qualtrics had the rise that it did (and created generational wealth for many people, especially much of the board and the leadership team) because of the hard work of a mission-driven team. If Qualtrics is going to do this again and hit 10X or 100X value multiples and become a generational SaaS company, issues with employee engagement and retention of top talent need to be addressed immediately. Here is what I would recommend: 1. Qualtrics needs to rebuild a culture of trust and collaboration, and that has to be driven through transparency and accountability at the very top. If leaders signal that they trust employees and want them to succeed, employees will trust leadership to guide them. 2. Invest heavily in systems, processes, and people. Qualtrics has significant needs for enterprise systems that work together (for example, the CRM and HRIS are poorly integrated with the other systems that they rely on). The new promotion philosophy makes sense from a cost-saving standpoint, but Qualtrics should not be cost-saving if that means we’re losing top talent that would deliver outsized value in the future. 3. Reconnect employees with the values and the mission that made this company “bigger than itself”. Becoming a top SaaS company is not motivating to the vast majority of employees if they have only marginal incentives for achieving that goal. Qualtrics’ investors and the board either needs share a much greater portion of the equity and give employees much more lucrative LTI for the financial success of the business, OR leadership needs to develop a culture that prioritizes CSR and the collective good Qualtrics can provide the world and the communities in which we operate. The company needs to do more than simply matching employee contributions to 5fortheFight. How will Qualtrics support vulnerable and marginalized people? Promote equitable, fair, inclusive, and just policies in the community? Protect the environment? How will Qualtrics be a force for good? Demonstrating good stewardship and social governance through corporate action will make Qualtrics an employer and a brand that employees and customers can be proud of.",
        "cons": "“Fast-paced growth SaaS company” also means major organizational changes are constant; the change fatigue is real and can be a lot to manage at times (I have been with Q for 7 years and have been through at least as many re-orgs). Recent layoffs (October 2023) have dampened moral and eroded trust in the exec leadership team, but it seems like the culture is rebounding. The hybrid work policy is not for everyone. There is a significant lack of diversity amongst the leadership team- you will see women and underrepresented minorities in the executive team, but the core group of decision makers (the Founder &amp; Board Chairman, CEO, COO, Chief Product Officer, President, many sales leaders) are all white men from Provo, Utah. Since being taken private again, Qualtrics’ promotion philosophy has become much more conservative and there are fewer opportunities for accelerated advancement compared to what you might find at a pre-IPO startup. The private equity firm that owns Q is heavily focused on profit margins, which may risk product development when many competitors are investing heavily in R&amp;D for AI.",

        "pros": "By far the dominant market leader in experience management software. The product is really exciting and always evolving. Change is constant, so there are lots of opportunities for making a meaningful impact on the success of the business. The pay is competitive in most markets for most roles, and the benefits are fantastic. 401k match, equity options, STI and LTI, lunches in most offices. The performance expectations are aggressive, but the bonuses are equally aggressive- exceptional work is recognized and rewarded here. It takes a lot to be exceptional with the kind of peers we have at Qualtrics, but I would rather deliver average work at this company than be a star performer some place else. The best part is the people that work here- there is a high bar for hiring and this place is filled with talented, motivated, intelligent, and empathetic people. The frontline managers and middle managers are generally very good and they care deeply about the success of their teams and their people. The leadership team is committed and competent (most have been with the company for years).",

      "# [Qualtrics Announces Top Consumer Experience Trends for 2024 on 2023-11-15](https://www.qualtrics.com/news/qualtrics-announces-top-consumer-experience-trends-for-2024/)\nPROVO, Utah & SEATTLE, Nov. 15, 2023 – Consumer expectations are on the rise heading into 2024, and they expect companies to deliver a consistently smooth experience whether they’re shopping on a website, calling customer support or using a chatbot, according to the 2024 Consumer Experience Trends Report from Qualtrics. The study found that as AI becomes a bigger part of daily life, consumers are putting a higher value on human connection and rewarding brands that deliver exceptional digital support with their dollars and lasting loyalty.\n\nQualtrics asked over 28,000 consumers in 26 countries around the world about their expectations and what companies should do to win and keep their business. The findings reveal that consumers are sharing less direct feedback and they are frustrated with the customer service they receive while shopping on websites and apps.\n\nThe report identified 4 key trends that will define the consumer experience in 2024:\n\nHuman connection is the foundation of a winning AI strategy\n\nGreat service beats low prices in the battle for customer loyalty\n\nDigital support is the weakest link in your customer journey\n\nConsumers don’t give feedback like they used to, so companies must listen in new ways\n\nA winning AI strategy must address consumers’ fear of losing the human connection\n\nDespite all of the hype around AI, consumers aren’t sure they’re ready for customer service delivered by AI directly; Less than half (48%) of consumers are comfortable getting help from a chatbot or using AI-powered self-service. Skeptical consumers worry about the loss of human connection, the potential for poor service and the possibility people could be replaced by AI in their jobs.\n\nCustomer experience professionals believe AI will give them a competitive advantage, as it can augment how they do their work. With the right data, AI has the potential to deliver service that closely resembles the human experience–it can understand human emotions, adapt to circumstances, act with empathy and create connections. And it can make the humans delivering service even better.\n\nThe challenge for brands in 2024 will be identifying the tasks AI does and doesn’t do well and aligning those capabilities with consumer preferences. 73% of consumers are comfortable using a brand’s automated system for simple, transactional activities like checking an order status. However, they are averse to using it when the stakes are high—only 19% of consumers would prefer to engage with a chatbot or self-service channel for advice on a medical issue.\n\nLack of a human to connect to Poor quality of the interactions Loss of jobs for employees Consumers’ top 3 concerns about AI 48% 45% 45%\n\n“Organizations are understandably excited about the potential of AI, but as they incorporate it into their business, they must take customers’ concerns into account,” said Moira Dorsey, Principal XM Catalyst, Qualtrics XM Institute. “Done well, AI-powered services will make human teams more effective and give customers a fast, effective way to get what they need through self-service and automated tasks.”\n\nCustomer service is even more important than low prices\n\nDespite rising prices and the risk of inflation, price will not be the primary driver of consumer purchase decisions in 2024. Consumers say that organizations that provide excellent customer service are more likely to gain their repeat business, with customer service and support ranking above low prices when it comes to the top drivers influencing consumer purchase decisions. Only product quality ranked higher.\n\nProduct / Service Quality Customer Service Support Low Price Easy Digital Experience Does good for society What will drive consumer purchases in 2024 61% 47% 43% 30% 18%\n\nBut lagging morale among frontline employees such as cashiers, restaurant servers, and bank tellers is a huge barrier to organizations delivering the level of experience that creates loyal customers. Qualtrics research shows frontline workers are less satisfied with their pay and development compared to non-frontline staff and they feel a lack of support to effectively do their job. These issues may get worse in 2024 as only 38% of CX professionals said, “training our customer service agents and frontline employees” would be a priority for the year ahead, according to Qualtrics research.\n\n“Great customer service starts with taking care of the humans engaging with customers on the frontline,” Dorsey said. “Customer service experiences are often where people have strong emotions, so they tend to influence future purchase decisions more than any other interaction.”\n\nDigital support will create winners and losers\n\nGreat digital support can have an outsized impact on customer loyalty. Despite being equally satisfied making a purchase online or in person, consumers are 2.7 times more likely to return if they had great digital support, compared to 2.5 times after great customer support from a person. Consumers are six percentage points less likely to be satisfied by their digital customer support experience, compared to human support.\n\nThe issue is especially pressing as brands are increasing their reliance on digital channels to drive their business. A recent Qualtrics study found that 70% of companies say that digital channels contribute to at least 40% of their revenue, and 85% of respondents expect that number to grow in the coming months.\n\n“Digital channels, such as websites and apps, are becoming increasingly critical in shaping the customer experience,” said Dorsey. “Brands that invest in improving the service and support they provide on their digital channels will pull ahead of the pack in customer retention and loyalty. “\n\nCustomers aren’t giving feedback like they used to – companies must listen in new ways\n\nOnly a third of consumers give direct feedback every time they have a bad experience with a company, but they are providing feedback in less direct ways, such as in call center conversations, online chat, product reviews and social media posts. Since 2021, the share of consumers providing feedback directly to the companies they buy from following a very bad experience has fallen by 7.2 percentage points, so organizations need to be smart about gathering feedback where customers are giving it and taking action to address it.\n\nCompanies can build a richer understanding of what customers want and expect by tuning into both direct and indirect sources of feedback. The latter may even provide a more authentic view into the customer experience and can surface issues or insights that may not come up on a traditional survey.\n\nTell friends and family Tell the company directly Leave a review online Share their experience on social media Say nothing at all What consumers do after a bad experience 45%\n\n-3.7 pts since 2021\n\n34%\n\n-7.2 pts since 2021\n\n26%\n\n-2.4 pts since 2021\n\n21%\n\n-3.7 pts since 2021\n\n21%\n\n+3.8 pts since 2021\n\nWhat consumers do after a good experience 50%\n\n-4.4 pts since 2021\n\n33%\n\n-5.1 pts since 2021\n\n34%\n\n-0.1 since 2021\n\n24%\n\n-2.6 pts since 2021\n\n17%\n\n+2.7 pts since 2021\n\nAccording to Dorsey, “Companies need a diverse set of listening tools to understand customers’ perceptions and deliver experiences that drive business value. As brands incorporate more unstructured and unsolicited data to understand what customers are thinking from sources like social media, product reviews, chat logs and call transcripts, they should combine it with operational data, such as average spend and visit frequency, to gain insight into what consumers are doing to understand how to serve them better.”\n\nRead the full 2024 Consumer Experience Trends Report here.\n\nAbout Qualtrics\n\nQualtrics, the leader and creator of the experience management category, is a cloud-native software platform that empowers organizations to deliver exceptional experiences and build deep relationships with their customers and employees.

      "# [Research: As AI Increases in the Workplace, Employees Are Open to Their Employers Listening on 2024-08-22](https://www.qualtrics.com/news/research-as-ai-increases-in-the-workplace-employees-are-open-to-their-employers-listening/)\nPROVO, Utah & SEATTLE, August 22, 2024 – Most employees are open to having their organizations analyze data from emails, messages and meetings to improve their employee experience, according to new Qualtrics research. Also known as passive listening, this practice provides valuable insights using data employees generate in their daily activities. In fact, only 27% of employees said they definitely or probably would not opt in to a program that analyzed text data from sources like work emails or instant messages to improve their experiences at work.\n\nEmployees’ self-reported comfort with their organization analyzing different data sources is significantly higher than what HR leaders predicted. The biggest difference is in direct messages; HR underestimated employee comfort by 16 percentage points.\n\nThe expansion of AI is increasing data collection and analysis by organizations trying to reign in expensive attrition. Employees generate valuable data in the course of their daily work, such as emails, Slack messages, IT tickets, and meeting invitations. AI can parse this data to reveal patterns that predict things like disengagement or burnout and allow employers to step in, especially as the volume of data increases.\n\n“This research underscores the crucial dialogue needed between employers and employees in the evolving landscape of today’s workplace,” said Dr. Benjamin Granger, Chief Workplace Psychologist at Qualtrics. “Good dialogue is two-way and employees appreciate opportunities to drive the conversation with senior leadership. Passive listening allows employees to raise topics that don’t show up in employee surveys and open up new lines of communication.”\n\nOther key findings of the research include:\n\nLower-level employees are much more wary about their organization analyzing their data than senior leaders, reflecting findings from Qualtrics’ 2024 Employee Experience Trends Report.\n\nJust 27% of individual contributors say they probably or definitely would opt in to a passive listening program, compared with 71% of C-suite leaders. This disparity in embracing new technology supports previous Qualtrics research that found executives were excited about the potential impact of AI while individual contributors were more likely to call it scary.\n\nEmployees are more comfortable with analysis of their emails and messages than social media.\n\nAmong text-based channels, they are most comfortable with work system processes like IT tickets, open-text survey responses and meeting transcripts being used. Employees are less comfortable with more personal data sources like email and Slack messages being analyzed, and least comfortable with their organization analyzing social media, even if it is anonymous.\n\nThe biggest concern employees have about passive listening is an invasion of privacy, followed by data security and the data being misinterpreted.\n\nFor employees who would not opt in to a passive listening program, transparency about how the data is used–or not used–and who had access to it, as well as control over opting out in the future are the top ways to change their minds.\n\nCompanies must build trust before introducing passive employee listening programs\n\nEmployees who trust senior leadership at their organization are significantly more willing to participate in a passive listening program than those who don’t trust their leaders. More than half (55%) of employees who trust senior leadership said they would probably or definitely share their data. If employees do not trust their senior leaders, the reverse is true – 53% said they probably or definitely would not choose to share their data.\n\n“Trust is foundational in developing a mutually beneficial relationship between employees and organizational leaders,” said Granger. “This is especially true when it comes to introducing new programs and technologies. Leaders can build trust by highlighting how individual employees will benefit and providing ongoing transparency and autonomy over their data.”\n\nEmployees are more comfortable with passive listening than HR leaders expect\n\n“In their laudable desire to protect employee privacy, HR leaders may be underestimating employee comfort with passive listening,” said Matt Evans, head of employee experience product science at Qualtrics. “When organizations highlight the benefits and address concerns, they will drive higher acceptance and gain valuable insights into what is top of mind for employees.”\n\nLearn more here.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis research was conducted in March 2024 among 1,000 desk-based workers and 100 HR leaders in Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. Respondents were selected from a randomized panel and considered eligible if they are at least 18 years of age.\n\nAbout Qualtrics\n\nQualtrics, the leader and creator of the experience management category, is a cloud-native software platform that empowers organizations to deliver exceptional experiences and build deep relationships with their customers and employees.

This leads to strong customer loyalty that accelerates revenue growth and reduces operating costs.\n\nResearch from Qualtrics and ServiceNow revealed 80% of customers said they have switched brands because of poor customer experience, and 43% of respondents said they were at least somewhat likely to switch brands after only a single negative customer service interaction. However, since 2021, the share of consumers providing feedback directly to the companies they buy from following a very bad experience has fallen by 7.2 percentage points.\n\nQualtrics empowers every organization to understand what’s going on at every stage of the customer journey, at every frontline touchpoint, without ever having to ask.\n\n“Fueled by our $500 million commitment to AI innovation, Qualtrics is making it easier than ever for customer experience teams to rapidly and meaningfully deliver the superior, personal, and human experiences their customers are looking for,” said Brad Anderson, President of Product, UX and Engineering at Qualtrics. “With these new purpose-built AI capabilities, Qualtrics is at the forefront of an exciting new age of experience management, giving organizations, including Hilton and Motorola Solutions, the power to improve every experience in the moment, across every channel that matters.”\n\nQualtrics AI and Qualtrics Frontline Locations™ allow frontline teams to connect with every customer in every location\n\nThe impact of consumers’ online reviews and comments on a business is huge – over two-thirds of consumers look at reviews before buying from a new brand. Responding to detractors can soften the impact of a negative review, but companies with multiple locations often struggle to capture and analyze the location-level insights necessary to tailor responses across all their online channels.\n\nNew AI-powered capabilities from Qualtrics help frontline teams – in-store and online – personalize the customer experience and remove points of friction across channels by listening to customer feedback across all channels (e.g., voice calls, chats, social reviews, ratings, surveys):\n\n● Frontline Locations Assist is an intuitive, purpose-built insights hub that analyzes every piece of customer feedback – including feedback from surveys, within the app, the contact center, online, and reviews – to equip frontline managers with actionable insights and recommended steps they should take to improve their customer experience and drive business value, such as replying to customer reviews, checking in on open tickets, and rewarding employees.\n\n● New AI-powered review and ticket response suggestions enable frontline teams to quickly resolve issues with automatically generated, personalized and appropriately tuned responses. This speeds up ticket resolution and online review response times, helping organizations exceed customer expectations for support, build stronger relationships and increase customer loyalty.\n\nWith Qualtrics AI-enabled capabilities, Hilton is now collecting and synthesizing feedback across the entire guest journey for its more than 7,600 global properties, including calls, chatbot interactions, email and messaging during and after a guest’s stay, in-app, and from digital surveys. Guest insights inform every aspect of the company’s commercial strategy, and in 2023, Hilton served hundreds of millions of guests and achieved record financial results.\n\nQualtrics AI-powered Frontline Digital™ solutions pinpoint, diagnose, & help prioritize broken digital experiences\n\nGreat online experiences are essential to attracting and retaining customers, but a recent Qualtrics study found that consumers feel businesses frequently fall short, failing to deliver a humanized, personalized digital experience. Frustrated users are more likely than satisfied users to leave the website and not complete desired actions, leading to costly support calls, and potentially lost customers. However, businesses often struggle to understand customer pain points or measure how frustrating online experiences affect conversion rates.\n\nQualtrics Digital Experience Analytics, powered by Qualtrics AI, continues to evolve with Digital Assist, a purpose-built digital insights hub made specifically for improving digital experiences:\n\n● New heatmap capabilities help digital and UX teams quickly identify and resolve web technical, design and product issues through a visual diagram of customer interactions with a company’s websites. Heatmaps are compiled using millions of clicks, scrolls and mouse movements to demonstrate on-page behavior and identify hotspots of user activity.\n\n● New funnel analytics enable businesses to identify major drop-off points along the web customer journey and understand why customers are failing to complete their tasks by combining experience data with behavioral clues, such as mouse thrashes, to fix problems quickly and efficiently.\n\n● New real-time frustration intercepting capabilities enable businesses to identify customers experiencing challenges online in real time and offer targeted support in the moment.\n\nCompanies can combine digital customer experience insights with other data sources – including profiles in Qualtrics Experience iD™, sentiment data from surveys, session replays, or operational data like purchase history – in Digital Experience Analytics to create a complete view of their customer experience. Qualtrics Frontline Digital and Frontline Care work together to uncover services calls specifically correlated with lack of information on digital channels and suggest actions to deflect those calls to self-service options, lowering operating costs in the service center.\n\nFor Motorola Solutions, a global leader in safety and security technologies, enhancing its global digital experiences is a priority. Using the digital solutions within Qualtrics XM for Customer Experience™ suite, Motorola Solutions is optimizing its web and eCommerce experiences to drive stronger web traffic and conversion rates while improving its customers’ overall satisfaction.\n\nQualtrics Frontline Care™ enables agents to build deeper human connections with AI\n\nNew real-time agent productivity solutions powered by Qualtrics AI help frontline agents resolve customer issues with empathy at speed and scale.\n\n● Customer Care Assist is a purpose-built app for aggregating insights & workflows across the customer care experience. Managers can generate personalized coaching plans based on each individual agent’s strengths and weaknesses, reducing time spent reviewing dashboards and listening to calls. Many contact center quality assurance (QA) practices today are costly, manual, slow, and biased, typically relying on a QA manager reviewing only three to five calls per week, per agent. Qualtrics AI automatically evaluates every call to identify attributes such as problem resolution, friendliness and compliance, to surface where teams may need additional coaching, improving customer service while saving time and money.\n\n● Qualtrics Automated Call Summaries uses Qualtrics AI to automatically summarize customer feedback, enabling frontline teams to instantly generate support tickets, send personalized follow-up emails, and create knowledge based articles using real-time information about customer issues and historical, personalized customer data from XiD.\n\nAdditional Information\n\n● Qualtrics Frontline Location Assist is available in private preview.\n\n● Qualtrics new Digital Experience Analytics capabilities are available in private preview.\n\n● Qualtrics Customer Care Assist is in private preview and Automated Call Summaries is generally available today.\n\n● You can learn more about Qualtrics XM for Customer Experience here.\n\nAbout Qualtrics\n\nQualtrics, the leader and creator of the experience management category, is a cloud-native software platform that empowers organizations to deliver exceptional experiences and build deep relationships with their customers and employees.

      "# [Duke renews contract with Qualtrics by Office of Information Technology on 2024-07-15](https://oit.duke.edu/news/duke-renews-contract-qualtrics/)\nThe university has reached an agreement on pricing, and there is no longer a risk of disruption with the Duke University/DKU-wide Qualtrics license at the end of the 2024 year. The new license covers the current volume of Qualtrics survey responses for another 5 years, through Dec 31, 2029.\n\nWho is covered under the new contract?\n\nThe contract that has been under negotiation includes users of the existing University and DKU service, as well as two other services used by the Health System:\n\nAcademic CoreXM (University/DKU)\n\nPatient Experience (Duke Health)\n\nDiscover for Contact Centers DHAS & DPC Triage (Duke Health)\n\nHow much will the new contract cost Duke?\n\nThe 2025 annual cost will be roughly 70 percent more than what the University paid in 2024 and 2.5x the license cost from 2023. However, it is a significant improvement over the initial proposed increase from the vendor which would have amounted to a 6x increase over the life of the contract, relative to 2023. The price now increases by ~3x relative to what the University paid in 2023.\n\nAn additional benefit is that the University now has a five-year contract over which to spread the increase.\n\nThe contract period also gives us more time gaining experience with current survey tools and upcoming tools on the market. We will also need to evaluate whether alternative funding options might be advisable in the future (e.g., for research projects, funding via grants may become an option).\n\nShould Duke researchers using Academic CoreXM still consider other survey tool options?\n\nIt is still important to consider other software for surveys with uncomplicated designs and where tracking longitudinal data is less essential. Duke will soon develop a request process to reduce the number of Qualtrics survey responses and, if necessary, direct them to a more appropriate survey tool. See a list of other survey tools available at Duke here: https://oit.duke.edu/service/survey-tools.\n\nUpdates on the new Qualtrics process will be shared broadly and posted on the OIT website: https://oit.duke.edu/service/qualtrics.\n\nHow do I know which tool is right for me?\n\nThe Office of Information Technology has developed a comparison chart to help Duke community members decide among various survey and forms tools - https://oit.duke.edu/help/articles/kb0037717.",

The partnership will help organizations more deeply understand relationships between quality, safety, and patient experiences.\n\nThis collaboration will move beyond traditional siloed measurement, combining key metrics and benchmarks Vizient and Qualtrics measure in order to drive meaningful improvements in patient outcomes and operational efficiency.\n\nUniversity of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann Health System, and Stanford Health Care—leaders in both clinical care and patient experience— participated in a pilot analysis for this groundbreaking initiative. The results of an initial analysis, presented this week at the Vizient Connections Summit, linked patient experience metrics such as clearer medical provider communication to important clinical outcomes, like emergency room visits, complications, and readmissions.\n\n\"Quality and patient experience are interrelated, but data is not easy to analyze at the patient level. By bringing quality, safety, and experience data together, we believe we can unlock the most impactful drivers of healthcare performance across multiple domains and the relationships between them,\" said David Levine, MD, FACEP, Chief Medical Officer for Vizient. \"This level of depth in insights has not been achieved in healthcare to date given siloed datasets and limited analytics.\"\n\n\"The initial analysis confirms so much of what we all believe: that the perception of experience is significantly related to clinical outcomes,\" said Dr. Adrienne Boissy, Chief Medical Officer, Qualtrics. \"But the thoughtful rigor of this work and the near term potential to focus improvement efforts of hardworking teams, prioritize interventions, and demonstrate value in dollars and operational gains is even more compelling.\"\n\nA New Era of Healthcare Performance Measurement\n\nHistorically, healthcare organizations have relied on siloed, retrospective data to measure performance and patient satisfaction. This new partnership between Vizient and Qualtrics will introduce a dynamic, forward-looking approach, allowing healthcare organizations to proactively manage performance and address clinical challenges before they manifest in performance data and drive continuous improvement with dynamic, actionable metrics that evolve with changing patient expectations and clinical environments.\n\nIdeal outcomes of the collaboration include:\n\nAnticipate Patient Outcomes: Harness patient feedback to predict clinical and operational outcomes, such as readmission rates, length of stay, and adverse clinical outcomes.\n\nClose the Gap Between Experience and Performance: Identify correlations between patient and clinical outcomes, providing healthcare leaders with the insights needed to address care gaps before they impact performance.\n\nDevelop Modern Experience Measurement: Define key elements of modern patient experience measurement that reflect real time performance, patient reported outcomes, and align to patient centered principles.\n\nFoundational Analyses with Leading Health Systems\n\nAn initial analysis of clinical and patient experience data from mutual clients University of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann Health System, and Stanford Health Care demonstrates the power of patient experience to drive better healthcare outcomes.\n\nKey findings included:\n\nPatients having a positive perception of communication with their caregivers was significantly associated with reductions in length of stay, 30-day readmissions, and emergency room visits.\n\nAmong inpatients with limited healthcare access, those who did not feel that their preferences were considered in their discharge plan were more likely to visit the emergency department within 30 days.\n\nBetter provider explanations could help mitigate the impact of adverse clinical events. Patients who rated provider explanations negatively exhibited significantly worse overall patient satisfaction when complications occurred, an effect that reversed when patients positively rated provider explanations.\n\nParticipating hospital leaders praised the collaboration and the insights delivered in the pilot.\n\n\"The combined analytics power of Qualtrics and Vizient allows us to break down data silos and gain actionable insights that directly enhance patient care,\" said Dan Lundergan, CEO at University of Utah Health Hospitals and Clinics. \"By understanding the connections between quality measures and patient experiences, we are better equipped to deliver high-value, patient-centered healthcare.\"\n\n\"This collaboration is a transformative step forward for health care. The ability to integrate and analyze diverse data sets in meaningful ways will power even more focused improvement efforts, ultimately fulfilling our commitment to creating more value for patients and populations,\" said Memorial Hermann Health System COO, Erin Asprec.\n\n\"We're excited to participate in this innovative collaboration with Qualtrics and Vizient,\" said David Entwistle, President and CEO of Stanford Health Care. \"By leveraging comprehensive data analysis, we can redefine patient experience and operational excellence, ensuring that every decision we make is closely aligned with our patients' needs and preferences.\"\n\nNext Steps and Industry-Wide Application\n\nOpportunities for other health systems to participate are expected to be rolled out following the completion of this initial phase with University of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann, and Stanford Health Care. The partnership will empower healthcare systems to take an innovative, data-driven approach to improving patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, positioning them for long-term success in an increasingly value-based care environment.\n\nAbout Vizient, Inc.\n\nVizient, Inc., the nation's largest provider-driven healthcare performance improvement company, serves more than 65% of the nation's acute care providers, including 97% of the nation's academic medical centers, and more than 35% of the non-acute market.

      "# [Vizient and Qualtrics Announce Strategic Partnership to Develop Predictive Experience Metrics to Revolutionize Healthcare Performance on 2024-09-17](https://newsroom.vizientinc.com/en-US/releases/releases-vizient-and-qualtrics-announce-strategic-partnership-to-develop-predictive-experience-metrics-to-revolutionize-healthcare-performance)\nQualtrics and Vizient combine quality and patient experience data from leading hospitals, showing a tie between patient experience and clinical outcomes\n\nInnovative partnership will empower healthcare organizations with holistic, actionable insights that will transform the way healthcare organizations measure and improve performance by using groundbreaking research-backed predictive experience models\n\nIRVING, Texas and PROVO, Utah, Sept. 17, 2024 — Vizient, Inc. the nation's largest healthcare performance improvement company, and Qualtrics, the leader and creator of the experience management category, today announced an innovative strategic partnership to employ experience metrics to transform the way healthcare organizations measure and improve performance. The partnership will help organizations more deeply understand relationships between quality, safety, and patient experiences.\n\nThis collaboration will move beyond traditional siloed measurement, combining key metrics and benchmarks Vizient and Qualtrics measure in order to drive meaningful improvements in patient outcomes and operational efficiency.\n\nUniversity of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann Health System, and Stanford Health Care—leaders in both clinical care and patient experience— participated in a pilot analysis for this groundbreaking initiative. The results of an initial analysis, presented this week at the Vizient Connections Summit, linked patient experience metrics such as clearer medical provider communication to important clinical outcomes, like emergency room visits, complications, and readmissions.\n\n\"Quality and patient experience are interrelated, but data is not easy to analyze at the patient level. By bringing quality, safety, and experience data together, we believe we can unlock the most impactful drivers of healthcare performance across multiple domains and the relationships between them,\" said David Levine, MD, FACEP, Chief Medical Officer for Vizient. \"This level of depth in insights has not been achieved in healthcare to date given siloed datasets and limited analytics.\"\n\n\"The initial analysis confirms so much of what we all believe: that the perception of experience is significantly related to clinical outcomes,\" said Dr. Adrienne Boissy, Chief Medical Officer, Qualtrics. \"But the thoughtful rigor of this work and the near term potential to focus improvement efforts of hardworking teams, prioritize interventions, and demonstrate value in dollars and operational gains is even more compelling.\"\n\nA New Era of Healthcare Performance Measurement\n\nHistorically, healthcare organizations have relied on siloed, retrospective data to measure performance and patient satisfaction. This new partnership between Vizient and Qualtrics will introduce a dynamic, forward-looking approach, allowing healthcare organizations to proactively manage performance and address clinical challenges before they manifest in performance data and drive continuous improvement with dynamic, actionable metrics that evolve with changing patient expectations and clinical environments.\n\nIdeal outcomes of the collaboration include:\n\nAnticipate Patient Outcomes: Harness patient feedback to predict clinical and operational outcomes, such as readmission rates, length of stay, and adverse clinical outcomes.\n\nClose the Gap Between Experience and Performance: Identify correlations between patient and clinical outcomes, providing healthcare leaders with the insights needed to address care gaps before they impact performance.\n\nDevelop Modern Experience Measurement: Define key elements of modern patient experience measurement that reflect real time performance, patient reported outcomes, and align to patient centered principles.\n\nFoundational Analyses with Leading Health Systems\n\nAn initial analysis of clinical and patient experience data from mutual clients University of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann Health System, and Stanford Health Care demonstrates the power of patient experience to drive better healthcare outcomes.\n\nKey findings included:\n\nPatients having a positive perception of communication with their caregivers was significantly associated with reductions in length of stay, 30-day readmissions, and emergency room visits.\n\nAmong inpatients with limited healthcare access, those who did not feel that their preferences were considered in their discharge plan were more likely to visit the emergency department within 30 days.\n\nBetter provider explanations could help mitigate the impact of adverse clinical events. Patients who rated provider explanations negatively exhibited significantly worse overall patient satisfaction when complications occurred, an effect that reversed when patients positively rated provider explanations.\n\nParticipating hospital leaders praised the collaboration and the insights delivered in the pilot.\n\n\"The combined analytics power of Qualtrics and Vizient allows us to break down data silos and gain actionable insights that directly enhance patient care,\" said Dan Lundergan, CEO at University of Utah Health Hospitals and Clinics. \"By understanding the connections between quality measures and patient experiences, we are better equipped to deliver high-value, patient-centered healthcare.\"\n\n\"This collaboration is a transformative step forward for health care. The ability to integrate and analyze diverse data sets in meaningful ways will power even more focused improvement efforts, ultimately fulfilling our commitment to creating more value for patients and populations,\" said Memorial Hermann Health System COO, Erin Asprec.\n\n\"We're excited to participate in this innovative collaboration with Qualtrics and Vizient,\" said David Entwistle, President and CEO of Stanford Health Care. \"By leveraging comprehensive data analysis, we can redefine patient experience and operational excellence, ensuring that every decision we make is closely aligned with our patients' needs and preferences.\"\n\nNext Steps and Industry-Wide Application\n\nOpportunities for other health systems to participate are expected to be rolled out following the completion of this initial phase with University of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann, and Stanford Health Care. The partnership will empower healthcare systems to take an innovative, data-driven approach to improving patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, positioning them for long-term success in an increasingly value-based care environment.\n\nAbout Vizient, Inc.\n\nVizient, Inc., the nation's largest provider-driven healthcare performance improvement company, serves more than 65% of the nation's acute care providers, including 97% of the nation's academic medical centers, and more than 35% of the non-acute market.
