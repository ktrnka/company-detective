As of 2024, Qualtrics has expanded its customer base significantly, growing from 10,000 to 18,000 customers during its time under SAP [(Fisher, CX Today, 2024)](https://www.cxtoday.com/voice-of-the-customer/court-approves-12-5bn-sap-qualtrics-sale-dismisses-stockholders-conflict-claims/).\n\nQualtrics generates revenue through its experience management platform, which is used by over 8,500 enterprises worldwide, including more than 75 percent of the Fortune 100 and 99 of the top 100 U.S. business schools [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/qualtrics).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nZig Serafin is the CEO of Qualtrics. He has expressed enthusiasm about the company's partnership with Silver Lake, highlighting their understanding of the business and commitment to innovation [(Fisher, CX Today, 2024)](https://www.cxtoday.com/voice-of-the-customer/court-approves-12-5bn-sap-qualtrics-sale-dismisses-stockholders-conflict-claims/). Alex Nemeth joined Qualtrics as the A/NZ lead in November 2024, bringing additional leadership to the company's regional operations [(Julia Talevski, 2024-11-20)](https://www.arnnet.com.au/article/3609969/alex-nemeth-joins-qualtrics-as-a-nz-lead.html).\n\n# News\n\n## Acquisitions and Partnerships\n\n- In March 2023, Qualtrics was sold to Silver Lake and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for $12.5 billion, transitioning back to private ownership. This acquisition is expected to allow Qualtrics to focus more on innovation and customer success without the pressures of public market scrutiny [(Fisher, CX Today, 2024)](https://www.cxtoday.com/voice-of-the-customer/court-approves-12-5bn-sap-qualtrics-sale-dismisses-stockholders-conflict-claims/).\n\n- Qualtrics and SAP announced a new partnership in January 2025 to help organizations deliver great employee experiences [(Gordon Peters, 2025-01-22)](http://itwire.com/strategy/qualtrics-and-sap-announce-new-partnership-to-‘help-organisations-deliver-great-employee-experiences’.html).\n\n## Product Developments\n\n- Qualtrics has been recognized for its investment in generative AI, which has been integrated into its CX solutions. This focus on AI is part of a broader trend in the industry, as companies seek to leverage technology to enhance customer experiences [(Fisher, CX Today, 2024)](https://www.cxtoday.com/voice-of-the-customer/court-approves-12-5bn-sap-qualtrics-sale-dismisses-stockholders-conflict-claims/).\n\n- The company introduced three new applications for its XM Platform aimed at frontline staff, enhancing customer connections across various environments [(Fisher, CX Today, 2024)](https://www.cxtoday.com/voice-of-the-customer/court-approves-12-5bn-sap-qualtrics-sale-dismisses-stockholders-conflict-claims/).\n\n## Market Position and Competitors\n\n- Qualtrics competes with other major players in the experience management space, including Medallia. The recent executive shakeup at Medallia, which involved the appointment of several former Qualtrics executives, highlights the competitive landscape and the ongoing evolution within the industry [(Nicastro, CMSWire, 2025)](https://www.cmswire.com/contact-center/medallia-adds-5-former-qualtrics-execs-including-new-ceo-mark-bishof/).\n\n## User Feedback and Community Insights\n\n- User feedback on platforms like Reddit indicates a mix of opinions regarding Qualtrics' product limitations, such as the recent implementation of a 100-widget limit on dashboards. Users have expressed frustration over this restriction, suggesting that it may hinder their ability to present data effectively [(Qualtrics Community, 2024)](https://community.qualtrics.com/cx-dashboards-8/cx-dashboards-widget-limit-31464). However, the company has been praised for its overall capabilities in experience management.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nQualtrics stands as a robust player in the experience management software market, with a strong focus on innovation and customer success. The recent acquisition and product developments position the company well for future growth. Prospective candidates and investors should consider Qualtrics' strategic direction, market position, and ongoing commitment to enhancing customer experiences through advanced technology.",

This license is built for business and has lots of analytics bells and whistles that are useless for research, and it also costs over double the annual subscription cost.\n\nMy SLAC is having a hard time justifying this price hike, so we're looking at alternative platforms.  We need something on par with Qualtrics in terms of question and output types, and the ability to have custom branding would be ideal (i.e. I don't want participants to be redirected to a random SurveyMonkey page after completing the survey).\n\nFor comparison, a site-wide license (unlimited responses) for my college with ~1200 students used to be $7500/year. Now it is limited to 1000 users and 25,000 responses for $15,000/year. We have been able to negotiate both of these prices down a little, but we're still looking at a $5k increase for more-restricted usage.\n\n## Comment ID jfqm2cy with +2 score by [(cequims, Reddit, 2023-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/jfqm2cy/) (in reply to ID 11ss3vs):\nJust got off the phone with our Qualtrics rep, and it's clear they have no interest in serving small businesses.

So far, I'm pretty happy with SurveySparrow. The features are sufficiently complex for just about everything our company needs to do across our many projects. The question options aren't as customizable as Qualtrics, and the automated reports could use a few improvements, but for the drastically lower cost I am happy to make adjustments to work with the available options. I will say that customer service is a bit spotty. They are often (but not always) available right away via their chat feature. I think most of their team is located in India, however, and sometimes time zone differences are an issue. My colleague on Pacific time tends says they often don't get back to her til the next day. I'm on East Coast time, and it's less of an issue. I also sometimes worry that because they are a smaller company, they may be less stable and more likely to have tech issues. For example, I once found that I couldn't edit data on the back end, then the next day it worked. And right now, there's a weird formatting issue where text is overlapping in the footer of the surveys. So there are definitely small signs that they are more scrappy than the big leagues. But our team of about 16 employees has been using it for about 10 months now, and it hasn't held us back.\n\n## Comment ID kzw0jm1 with +1 score by [(Spiritual-Dance-562, Reddit, 2024-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/kzw0jm1/) (in reply to ID 11ss3vs):\nQualtrics is clearly trying to eliminate small businesses.

Plus, as opposed to Qualtrics, Survicate is a small company that understands and values all of its customers, so surely you'd be able to get a good deal.

This license is built for business and has lots of analytics bells and whistles that are useless for research, and it also costs over double the annual subscription cost.\n\nMy SLAC is having a hard time justifying this price hike, so we're looking at alternative platforms.  We need something on par with Qualtrics in terms of question and output types, and the ability to have custom branding would be ideal (i.e. I don't want participants to be redirected to a random SurveyMonkey page after completing the survey).\n\nFor comparison, a site-wide license (unlimited responses) for my college with ~1200 students used to be $7500/year. Now it is limited to 1000 users and 25,000 responses for $15,000/year. We have been able to negotiate both of these prices down a little, but we're still looking at a $5k increase for more-restricted usage.\n\n## Comment ID jcinizm with +8 score by [(cattyditty, Reddit, 2023-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/11ss012/qualtrics_alternatives/jcinizm/) (in reply to ID 11ss012):\nREDCap!

The number of surveys I've done that lack page breaks is astounding. Seeing more than about 10 questions on a single page is overwhelming for most people and increases your chances of accidentally skipped questions.\n\nFor question matrices with Likert scale items, ensure that the labels for the response options appear at the top and the middle of the matrix (not just the top). You can change this in question settings. This will help to ensure that respondents don't have to keep scrolling to the top of the page to see the the response options. People will forget what the response options are, especially if you have a larger number of response options. \n\nSet the questions to \"request response\". This will flag skipped questions for participants so they are asked if they want to continue the survey without answering a skipped question. This doesn't work for matrices though.\n\nUse multie blocks as you're setting up your survey. For example, if you have demographics questions, mental health questions, and substance use questions, put all of your demographics questions in one block, your mental health questions in second block, and your substance use questions in a third block.  This is for YOUR sake. It's easier to find/edit/move questions when you have multipe blocks rather than what could be 100+ questions placed into a single block.

On review sites, they get high marks for being “well-rounded,” but when you dive into market researchers’ opinions, it’s a different story. The pricing complaints are real—it’s not transparent, and you end up paying way more than expected. Plus, customer service issues? Definitely frustrating when you’re dealing with tight deadlines and complex surveys.\n\nI think part of the problem is that Qualtrics has grown so much, and with that comes the loss of personalized support and that sharp focus on survey quality. It’s like they’re trying to be *everything* for *everyone*, and that just doesn’t work when you need reliability and flexibility in your research.\n\nIn my experience, if you’re looking for a solid alternative, SurveySparrow hits a sweet spot. It’s way more intuitive, so you don’t need a specialist breathing down your neck for every little thing. Plus, it’s self-serve, which is what a lot of people here seem to be looking for. You can easily run and manage your surveys without those constant check-ins from a project manager. And with automated workflows, real-time insights, and sentiment analysis baked in, it feels much lighter without sacrificing the important features.\n\nBut yeah, it seems like Qualtrics sticks around because switching can feel like a hassle, and it’s what a lot of agencies are already comfortable with. Still, the cracks are showing, and people are starting to explore other tools. Have any of you tried switching, or are you sticking with it because of familiarity?\n\n### Comment ID lnholkb with +1 score by [(reallymemorable, Reddit, 2024-09-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lnholkb/) (in reply to ID lnhny3o):\nSo why can't one of their many competitors unseat them?

the quality of the sample provided was so poor that we ended up removing all of the Qualtrics respondents from the final reporting.\n\nSo, that’s why I don’t like Qualtrics.\n\n### Comment ID lp9y2vw with +1 score by [(reallymemorable, Reddit, 2024-09-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lp9y2vw/) (in reply to ID lp39eev):\nWhat platform did you switch to?\n\n#### Comment ID lpwksqm with +1 score by [(jelybely8, Reddit, 2024-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lpwksqm/) (in reply to ID lp9y2vw):\nVoxco\n\n## Comment ID lx4df7p with +2 score by [(shkilo, Reddit, 2024-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lx4df7p/) (in reply to ID 1fijau3):\nIMO their platform has major usability issues and performance issues, and the customer support and account managers are abysmal.\n\nThe whole vibe I get from them...\n\n...from the sloppy and frustrating product design, to the lack of response to feedback provided to them, to their confusing support hub, to their ideation platform that basically ask you how much you'd be willing to pay for a proposed enhancement, to their support callback time estimates being consistently and significantly inaccurate, to their extensive knowledge base that somehow manages to never answer my questions...\n\n...is that they couldn't care less about the experience of their own customers.\n\n## Comment ID lnhospx with +3 score by [(AMKumle24, Reddit, 2024-09-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lnhospx/) (in reply to ID 1fijau3):\nThey also have severe control issues, they always need to have one of their specialists involved with a project, or they force implementation hours on you.\n\n### Comment ID lnjxs2t with +2 score by [(pnutbutterpirate, Reddit, 2024-09-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lnjxs2t/) (in reply to ID lnhospx):\nThis has not been my experience.

They don't create the surveys, they just provide the means for other people to. Some surveys on Qualtrics work just fine and pay off as advertised, but often you'll get a flurry of surveys made by people who don't know what they're doing.

This list is a mix of pros and cons and is in no particular order:\n\n- the survey design functionality itself is superior to what you would find with most vendors.\n- data visualization through dashboards is highly effective for standard org use cases (eg manager and exec dashboards, filtering, etc.). The fact that your data lives in the same platform makes data eng work unnecessary.\n- the dashboards themselves are limited though if you're trying to do anything \"highly rigorous\" like include estimates based on weighting. \n- if you're looking to develop an organizational survey program Qualtrics will have everything you need for pretty much any use case an exec leadership team could currently dream up. However, Qualtrics is not built to support weekly or daily surveying. \n- Qualtrics employee survey platform is frustratingly more limited than their CX platform (see weighting issue above)\n- NLP capability is poor, but it is better than most other vendors. It will probably improve over time now that they have acquired Clarabridge (i think that's the name of the company anyway)\n- Qualtrics is $$$ and is likely going to become even more so in the future \n\nDifficult to know what to focus on without knowing your intended use case, but hopefully this is helpful!\n\n### Comment ID le79r9j with +2 score by [(ZestyMuffin85496, Reddit, 2024-07-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/le79r9j/) (in reply to ID haqn6tm):\nwould qualrics release your name to your employer if they stated they are supposed to be anonymous?\n\n## Comment ID hass6s3 with +5 score by [(armyprof, Reddit, 2021-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/hass6s3/) (in reply to ID pdiz5m):\nLet me preface my thoughts with some context.\n\nI’ve been the admin and key user for Qualtrics for two global companies for eight years now…I also do consulting on the side.  I have two certifications with them as well; the XM CM platforms.  My graduate work was in research methods and survey research was a big part of it.\n\nQualtrics has a lot going for it and has some problems too.  Overall I recommend it, but here’s a breakdown.\n\nPros:\n\nThe customer service is very good.  If you call you’ll get help.  In eight years and who knows how many calls I’ve yet to not get an answer to a question.  Sometimes the answer is no, but I’ve never had trouble reaching anyone or felt like they didn’t know what they were doing.  \n\n2:  the survey platform itself is pretty robust and will do about anything you need it too with a few exceptions.  And it’s pretty easy and intuitive to use.\n\n3:  the new tools like text and stats IQ or the cross tab tool are fantastic enhancements.  \n\n4:  the dashboard tool is excellent for helping other users explore their data.\n\nCons:\n\n1:  it’s expensive.\n\n2:  there are certain baffling features that it should have but doesn’t.  For example, being able to independently recode or reverse code items in a matrix, or device in what aggregation you want for scoring instead of just a sum.\n\n3:  reporting is a bit clunky.  They used to have a fantastic report tool that was super flexible.  But they dumbed it down to make it easier for beginners to use but less powerful.  You can’t, for example, resize the height of rows in tables or put things on the page freely.  \n\nOverall I find it a good tool, and use it successfully with client work constantly.  I do wish they’d listen to some suggestions sometimes, but overall I’m very satisfied with it.  \n\nGood luck!\n\n### Comment ID hatid6q with +1 score by [(Bite-Expensive, Reddit, 2021-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/hatid6q/) (in reply to ID hass6s3):\nThank you for the thorough overview!

So let’s say you have a matrix question with ten items on a 1-5 Likert scale.  With StatsIQ you can then do, say, an ANOVA on all those items or any subset of them by picking an IV (like ethnicity).  You’ll get all your results like significance, effect size, etc.  Super handy.\n\nText IQ is text analytics.  Topic/subtopics, and sentiment analysis.  Also super handy.\n\nThese can be used together.  You could, for example, do a comparison of means on a question using your sentiment categories as IVs.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n## Comment ID hatfq0s with +5 score by [(kongfukinny, Reddit, 2021-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/hatfq0s/) (in reply to ID pdiz5m):\nI’ve been running survey programs for some time now. Worked with and demoed various tools and currently using Qualtrics. Here’s my high level summary:\n\n1. Ur tool will depend on your needs. My company really likes to do surveys and they love to ask all sorts of wonky display logic type questions as well as create forms for events and other various use cases for surveys. This is really where Qualtrics shines over other tools. It has so many features that you can literally do anything with it. That said, if your looking for the simple most effective platform for engagement surveys, Qualtrics is not it.\n\n2. Cost is moderate IMO. It depends on the size of your business but it’s not the most expensive solution out there. I was quoted by Glint at twice the rate we pay for Qualtrics.\n\n3. Dashboards and analytics suck in Qualtrics. Tools like Glint or Peakon automate all the dash boarding for you. Qualtrics dashboarding and analytics is super admin cost heavy and isn’t nearly as robust something like PowerBI. That said if you have the resources, there is an SFTP integration with Qualtrics that could allow you to automate a pipeline to SQL and be able to automate dashboards for recurring surveys.\n\n4. Support for the most part is pretty bad. This surprised me. I work for a reputable tech company that I would think Qualtrics would consider a high profile client. It took us to threatening to end the contract early for them to switch us to a more involved CSM. This was night and day compares to when I previously used Glint where our CSM was always on top of things and helpful.\n\n5. Their “science” isn’t very scientific IMO. They have a hard time giving me straight answers on where their questions come from, why they design questions the way they do, or what research supports their validity and reliability. This again is unlock other platforms I’ve used which are happy to share white papers and research to support the utility of their measures.\n\nTL;DR and going back to your original question about what they provide that others don’t, we’ll not much really. But again, it depends on your needs. They provide dashboards but not automated like some platforms. They provide question banks but validity is questionable compared to other platforms. Their big sell is in their wide ranging features, but if your use case is simply engagement surveys, these might not be useful to you.\n\n### Comment ID hathqz3 with +2 score by [(Bite-Expensive, Reddit, 2021-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/hathqz3/) (in reply to ID hatfq0s):\nThank you for such a thoughtful response!\n\n## Comment ID haqj466 with +3 score by [(aeywaka, Reddit, 2021-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/haqj466/) (in reply to ID pdiz5m):\nFrome someone not currently able to use qualtrics (would take a large initiative to implement).

Their crowdsourcing services produce low quality data, customer service unhelpful, and actual survey system is static with no new developments to do sound, rigorous data collection. More and more they are chasing enterprise solutions, new markets, and feel increasingly like the SPSS of survey solutions. They would rather spend a ton of money on huge fluff events with oprah as a speaker than actually build out their tools.\n\nThe only advantages include it is easy to use, has a few nice embedding and mail survey features, and offers both the storage and interface for data collection. While I don't have an immediate alternative I would seriously consider any other I/O or research oriented survey platform as they can easily mimic an easy user interface but provide a much better platform with more capabilities.\n\n## Comment ID jd44nu6 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-03-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/jd44nu6/) (in reply to ID pdiz5m):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID jd44nvk with +1 score by [(AutoModerator, Reddit, 2023-03-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/jd44nvk/) (in reply to ID jd44nu6):\nYou are a new user with less than two weeks of reddit activity.

If Qualtrics is going to do this again and hit 10X or 100X value multiples and become a generational SaaS company, issues with employee engagement and retention of top talent need to be addressed immediately. Here is what I would recommend: 1. Qualtrics needs to rebuild a culture of trust and collaboration, and that has to be driven through transparency and accountability at the very top. If leaders signal that they trust employees and want them to succeed, employees will trust leadership to guide them. 2. Invest heavily in systems, processes, and people. Qualtrics has significant needs for enterprise systems that work together (for example, the CRM and HRIS are poorly integrated with the other systems that they rely on). The new promotion philosophy makes sense from a cost-saving standpoint, but Qualtrics should not be cost-saving if that means we’re losing top talent that would deliver outsized value in the future. 3. Reconnect employees with the values and the mission that made this company “bigger than itself”. Becoming a top SaaS company is not motivating to the vast majority of employees if they have only marginal incentives for achieving that goal. Qualtrics’ investors and the board either needs share a much greater portion of the equity and give employees much more lucrative LTI for the financial success of the business, OR leadership needs to develop a culture that prioritizes CSR and the collective good Qualtrics can provide the world and the communities in which we operate. The company needs to do more than simply matching employee contributions to 5fortheFight. How will Qualtrics support vulnerable and marginalized people? Promote equitable, fair, inclusive, and just policies in the community? Protect the environment? How will Qualtrics be a force for good? Demonstrating good stewardship and social governance through corporate action will make Qualtrics an employer and a brand that employees and customers can be proud of.",

          "cons": "“Fast-paced growth SaaS company” also means major organizational changes are constant; the change fatigue is real and can be a lot to manage at times (I have been with Q for 7 years and have been through at least as many re-orgs). Recent layoffs (October 2023) have dampened moral and eroded trust in the exec leadership team, but it seems like the culture is rebounding. The hybrid work policy is not for everyone. There is a significant lack of diversity amongst the leadership team- you will see women and underrepresented minorities in the executive team, but the core group of decision makers (the Founder &amp; Board Chairman, CEO, COO, Chief Product Officer, President, many sales leaders) are all white men from Provo, Utah. Since being taken private again, Qualtrics’ promotion philosophy has become much more conservative and there are fewer opportunities for accelerated advancement compared to what you might find at a pre-IPO startup. The private equity firm that owns Q is heavily focused on profit margins, which may risk product development when many competitors are investing heavily in R&amp;D for AI.",

The performance expectations are aggressive, but the bonuses are equally aggressive- exceptional work is recognized and rewarded here. It takes a lot to be exceptional with the kind of peers we have at Qualtrics, but I would rather deliver average work at this company than be a star performer some place else. The best part is the people that work here- there is a high bar for hiring and this place is filled with talented, motivated, intelligent, and empathetic people. The frontline managers and middle managers are generally very good and they care deeply about the success of their teams and their people.

And with full realization that no one is perfect, and success is messy and employees can't just blame management for their own shortcomings and should look in the mirror more often. Guilty as charged.  But management seems to be missing just one critical awareness.\n\nSome things even XM can't measure.  X Data helps, but it will never tell the whole story. Do things to build trust and connection and social capital that don't make sense on your financial statements.  Don't tell the employees that they wanted more money and less parties based on their own survey responses. Give them both.  Don't remind them that it will all be worth it because of the money they will make and the financial strategy for the stage of growth and the market we are in, and this new level of chess that private equity is taking us to. That will not fix the core structural issue that the people at this company are not as connected with a sense of meaning and belonging as deeply as they used to be even if on the engagement surveys lots of people say they have a best friend at the organization, and they like their manager.    The cost of ignoring that unseen disconnection, far outweighs any \"frivolous\" expense incurred to foster relationships again.  In my experience, Qualtrics is made up of some of the most brilliant and great people in the world who want to work hard and be consistent and inclusive and do what is right and celebrate together when they all get rich or richer if they catch the curve right and persevere.  They are proud to work there and of what Qualtrics can do and the impact its having in the world, and are willing to stick with it through almost anything and forgive all the mistakes and let downs and overpromises while they watch executives who urged them to play the long game, strategically take their shares and run.  But it seems like despite all your knowledge and experience and resources and expertise and the respect of your brand, you are messing up one thing that you can't mess up...\n\nYou can't be customer-obsessed if you don't treat every single one of your employees as your most important customers.  \n\nAccountability can co-exist with this, and you can keep your investors happy. And the employees are not usually as spoiled or entitled or ungrateful as they might seem.  They are just tired and disconnected.  Don't just say that employee experience engagement has gotten better based on quarter-over-quarter survey results.   No one cares.  Its interesting insight, but no one who is not responsible for that number actually cares about that number.  And its only going to frustrate them  to hear that win if they don't feel it.  It has to be something shared and palpable that only a human can sense. Use AI and stats and surveys and dashboards for everything else.  Make the investors happy.  But go back to making the employees first.  That's how you got here.  Thanks for all the years and work and risks taken you have provided and sacrificed to make it possible.  You deserve it.  No shame.  Just consider it. ",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "Take this with a grain of salt. But they forfeited their internal culture to keep winning bigger and faster. I hope they get it back. They had a harder and harder time adapting to their own rapid and relentless growth and success as time went on. I think they tried hard, but it just had so much unchecked momentum, that it became chaotic and disjointed to respond to the sheer amount of work and demand it created. Hiring more rapidly didn't fix the problem. There was a lot of collateral damage in the operational cohesiveness and culture of one team that was previously in the org. Lots of conflicting incentives had gradually developed that didn't get addressed enough or mapped or aligned very well along the way, so the individuals who desperately needed to work together with a benevolent mindset across departments had progressively lower natural motivation or patience to keep playing as a team. But they are working on it.",

There are opportunities for progression, but it is mostly in positions that are entry level (Technical Account Manager, Enterprise Support, and Resolution Analyst.) Enterprise Support does the same work, but gets paid more. It would drive me crazy when people in that team would ask me questions, and I would just think that I have the same learning and training, and they're getting paid more than me to do the same work.

Management’s inability to listen (starting with skip level manager and up to company management) was shocking. Lots of burn out. Many people were happy to be in the lay-off group and many were sad they weren’t. Somehow the company manages to attract amazing people, so I genuinely hope they’re able to turn things around and rebuild. Really grateful for everything I learned at Q and wish them the best!",

Big layoffs recently, many jobs moved to lower cost locations and other countries, no leadership accountability whatsoever. Total chaos followed. RTO enforcement coming. Pay cuts (or absence of refreshers) likely coming. Everyone good is looking to leave soon. Product is also incredibly boring to work on although I don't personally mind as long as working hours stay low. Not a single person in the C-suite deserves to be there. They are driving the company away from being a survey platform (which we excel at) to being a management suggestion tool (which we're bad at and customers don't need). They set on this path when the economy was good, and many customers were shelling out for a luxury product and making decisions based on employee and customer feedback. But now that the tech economy is bad, decision making is driven only by profit, making Qualtrics' experience management insights irrelevant. For example, Qualtrics can tell Delta that customers want extra leg room on flights. But Delta doesn't care, they need the money from those 3 extra rows. It is a rare case when Qualtrics can provide an insight that 1.) is novel and 2.) is actionable in a profitable way.",

Big layoffs recently, many jobs moved to lower cost locations and other countries, no leadership accountability whatsoever. Total chaos followed. RTO enforcement coming. Pay cuts (or absence of refreshers) likely coming. Everyone good is looking to leave soon. Product is also incredibly boring to work on although I don't personally mind as long as working hours stay low. Not a single person in the C-suite deserves to be there. They are driving the company away from being a survey platform (which we excel at) to being a management suggestion tool (which we're bad at and customers don't need). They set on this path when the economy was good, and many customers were shelling out for a luxury product and making decisions based on employee and customer feedback. But now that the tech economy is bad, decision making is driven only by profit, making Qualtrics' experience management insights irrelevant. For example, Qualtrics can tell Delta that customers want extra leg room on flights. But Delta doesn't care, they need the money from those 3 extra rows. It is a rare case when Qualtrics can provide an insight that 1.) is novel and 2.) is actionable in a profitable way.",

Management’s inability to listen (starting with skip level manager and up to company management) was shocking. Lots of burn out.

        "advice": "Don’t risk selling long-term competitive advantages and strategic value differentiators for short-term ROI and immediate profit margins. Qualtrics’ platform is ripe for disruption if we do not stay at the bleeding edge of emerging technology. To do this, Silver Lake, ELT, and the board need to be willing to invest heavily in the people that make this business special. Qualtrics had the rise that it did (and created generational wealth for many people, especially much of the board and the leadership team) because of the hard work of a mission-driven team. If Qualtrics is going to do this again and hit 10X or 100X value multiples and become a generational SaaS company, issues with employee engagement and retention of top talent need to be addressed immediately. Here is what I would recommend: 1. Qualtrics needs to rebuild a culture of trust and collaboration, and that has to be driven through transparency and accountability at the very top. If leaders signal that they trust employees and want them to succeed, employees will trust leadership to guide them. 2. Invest heavily in systems, processes, and people. Qualtrics has significant needs for enterprise systems that work together (for example, the CRM and HRIS are poorly integrated with the other systems that they rely on). The new promotion philosophy makes sense from a cost-saving standpoint, but Qualtrics should not be cost-saving if that means we’re losing top talent that would deliver outsized value in the future. 3. Reconnect employees with the values and the mission that made this company “bigger than itself”. Becoming a top SaaS company is not motivating to the vast majority of employees if they have only marginal incentives for achieving that goal. Qualtrics’ investors and the board either needs share a much greater portion of the equity and give employees much more lucrative LTI for the financial success of the business, OR leadership needs to develop a culture that prioritizes CSR and the collective good Qualtrics can provide the world and the communities in which we operate. The company needs to do more than simply matching employee contributions to 5fortheFight. How will Qualtrics support vulnerable and marginalized people? Promote equitable, fair, inclusive, and just policies in the community? Protect the environment? How will Qualtrics be a force for good? Demonstrating good stewardship and social governance through corporate action will make Qualtrics an employer and a brand that employees and customers can be proud of.",
        "cons": "“Fast-paced growth SaaS company” also means major organizational changes are constant; the change fatigue is real and can be a lot to manage at times (I have been with Q for 7 years and have been through at least as many re-orgs). Recent layoffs (October 2023) have dampened moral and eroded trust in the exec leadership team, but it seems like the culture is rebounding. The hybrid work policy is not for everyone. There is a significant lack of diversity amongst the leadership team- you will see women and underrepresented minorities in the executive team, but the core group of decision makers (the Founder &amp; Board Chairman, CEO, COO, Chief Product Officer, President, many sales leaders) are all white men from Provo, Utah. Since being taken private again, Qualtrics’ promotion philosophy has become much more conservative and there are fewer opportunities for accelerated advancement compared to what you might find at a pre-IPO startup. The private equity firm that owns Q is heavily focused on profit margins, which may risk product development when many competitors are investing heavily in R&amp;D for AI.",

Change is constant, so there are lots of opportunities for making a meaningful impact on the success of the business. The pay is competitive in most markets for most roles, and the benefits are fantastic. 401k match, equity options, STI and LTI, lunches in most offices. The performance expectations are aggressive, but the bonuses are equally aggressive- exceptional work is recognized and rewarded here. It takes a lot to be exceptional with the kind of peers we have at Qualtrics, but I would rather deliver average work at this company than be a star performer some place else. The best part is the people that work here- there is a high bar for hiring and this place is filled with talented, motivated, intelligent, and empathetic people. The frontline managers and middle managers are generally very good and they care deeply about the success of their teams and their people.

And with full realization that no one is perfect, and success is messy and employees can't just blame management for their own shortcomings and should look in the mirror more often. Guilty as charged.  But management seems to be missing just one critical awareness.\n\nSome things even XM can't measure.  X Data helps, but it will never tell the whole story. Do things to build trust and connection and social capital that don't make sense on your financial statements.  Don't tell the employees that they wanted more money and less parties based on their own survey responses. Give them both.  Don't remind them that it will all be worth it because of the money they will make and the financial strategy for the stage of growth and the market we are in, and this new level of chess that private equity is taking us to. That will not fix the core structural issue that the people at this company are not as connected with a sense of meaning and belonging as deeply as they used to be even if on the engagement surveys lots of people say they have a best friend at the organization, and they like their manager.    The cost of ignoring that unseen disconnection, far outweighs any \"frivolous\" expense incurred to foster relationships again.  In my experience, Qualtrics is made up of some of the most brilliant and great people in the world who want to work hard and be consistent and inclusive and do what is right and celebrate together when they all get rich or richer if they catch the curve right and persevere.  They are proud to work there and of what Qualtrics can do and the impact its having in the world, and are willing to stick with it through almost anything and forgive all the mistakes and let downs and overpromises while they watch executives who urged them to play the long game, strategically take their shares and run.  But it seems like despite all your knowledge and experience and resources and expertise and the respect of your brand, you are messing up one thing that you can't mess up...\n\nYou can't be customer-obsessed if you don't treat every single one of your employees as your most important customers.  \n\nAccountability can co-exist with this, and you can keep your investors happy. And the employees are not usually as spoiled or entitled or ungrateful as they might seem.  They are just tired and disconnected.  Don't just say that employee experience engagement has gotten better based on quarter-over-quarter survey results.   No one cares.  Its interesting insight, but no one who is not responsible for that number actually cares about that number.  And its only going to frustrate them  to hear that win if they don't feel it.  It has to be something shared and palpable that only a human can sense. Use AI and stats and surveys and dashboards for everything else.  Make the investors happy.  But go back to making the employees first.  That's how you got here.  Thanks for all the years and work and risks taken you have provided and sacrificed to make it possible.  You deserve it.  No shame.  Just consider it. ",
        "cons": "Take this with a grain of salt. But they forfeited their internal culture to keep winning bigger and faster. I hope they get it back. They had a harder and harder time adapting to their own rapid and relentless growth and success as time went on. I think they tried hard, but it just had so much unchecked momentum, that it became chaotic and disjointed to respond to the sheer amount of work and demand it created. Hiring more rapidly didn't fix the problem. There was a lot of collateral damage in the operational cohesiveness and culture of one team that was previously in the org. Lots of conflicting incentives had gradually developed that didn't get addressed enough or mapped or aligned very well along the way, so the individuals who desperately needed to work together with a benevolent mindset across departments had progressively lower natural motivation or patience to keep playing as a team.

      "# [CX Dashboards widget limit](https://community.qualtrics.com/cx-dashboards-8/cx-dashboards-widget-limit-31464)\nHi @Aggarwal,\n\nThanks for the reply. I think this is something set in stone for newer dashboard pages or something that has since been implemented (without informing us in the weekly bulletin). The support page states it so I can only assume it is for all users. I think the caveat is that where one had a dashboard with more than 100 widgets in before the time they implemented it then you can still edit them but you just can’t add or duplicate new ones.\n\nI must say 100 widgets can be used up very easily if you are wanting to make the dashboard look presentable and show images and text boxes to help guide the user. It doesn’t take long to use that up. We split our data in many ways so need to ensure this is easily viewable by ensuring it has all the data on one page. Pages filters won’t allow you to compare the different datasets in one go so that’s not really a solution in this context. (i do use pages filters though).\n\nI appreciate Qualtrics (if they do read this) they have sided with caution as they want to make sure their dashboards run smoothly but if the user reads their support page I feel they should not have made this a statutory limit and more of a guidance. Then it’s our responsibility. (more so if they were to sort out all the errors that come through in the console window about each widget, that my help too!)\n\nI feel another product idea coming along but as many users will know - working with their product idea system to be honest is not workable nor usable at the best of times (so what’s the point I hear myself say - which is a really sad state of affairs when you get to that point). :( Anyway I digress.\n\nIf anyone has a solution to this that would be great\n\nThanks\n\nRod Pestell",

      "# [Court Approves SAP’s $12.5BN Qualtrics Sale, Dismisses Stockholders’ Conflict Claims by Rhys Fisher on 2024-07-24](https://www.cxtoday.com/voice-of-the-customer/court-approves-12-5bn-sap-qualtrics-sale-dismisses-stockholders-conflict-claims/)\nA chancery court has dismissed the suit brought forward by two Qualtrics stockholders accusing the company of favoring a conflicted offer for the $12.5 billion sale of the company in March of last year.\n\nThe class case alleged that Qualtrics and SAP – which owned a 71 percent stake in Qualtrics at the time – accepted an $18.15 per-share bid from Silver Lake and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, despite having also received a $21 offer from Thoma Bravo.\n\nCounsel for the plaintiffs claimed that the agreed deal benefitted SAP rather than the stockholders, arguing that the company chose to sell to an ally in Silver Lake rather than a rival in Thoma Bravo, costing investors and stockholders money in the process.\n\nIndeed, CX vendors within Thoma Bravo’s portfolio include Calabrio, Qlik, and – most interestingly – Qualtrics’s closest competitor, Medallia.\n\nThey also stated that the terms of the deal – which included the continuation of intercompany agreements between SAP and Qualtrics – were “generally favorable to SAP.”\n\nHowever, Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster ruled in Qualtrics and SAP’s favor, claiming that the plaintiffs were unable to prove any tangible benefit for SAP in selling to Silver Lake rather than Thoma Bravo.\n\nThis is a situation where the plaintiff needs to come up with something more. What’s required is some form of incremental benefit over the status quo that the controller would receive.\n\n“The plaintiff says the new agreement must mean that they conferred some benefit on SAP. I don’t think that’s what the law says.”\n\nLaster also questioned the accuracy of the $21 offer from Thoma Bravo, suggesting that the two deals were at completely different stages, with the $18.50 price being locked in, whereas the $21 was more open to fluctuation after deeper scrutiny.\n\n“In terms of Thoma Bravo’s response, there was never an offer of [buyer] contractual provisions. They didn’t get to the point of hiring an economic consultant to look at those types of things.\n\nFirst, $21 was an initial indication of interest from a private equity buyer. That makes it somewhat of a questionable number. That number often goes down as due diligence continues.\n\nThe Deal in Question\n\nIn March of last year, it was announced that Silver Lake and CPP Investments had acquired Qualtrics for $12.5BN.\n\nThe deal included the sale of SAP’s remaining 71 percent stake in Qualtrics, which it purchased for $8 billion in 2018.\n\nHaving spun Qualtrics into an IPO, SAP saw a significant rise in the company’s market value as well as its customer base growing from 10,000 to 18,000\n\nHowever, in spite of this, SAP had been gradually reducing its percentage since the acquisition and, following the post-pandemic tech market downturn, decided to sell its remaining stake.\n\nIn discussing the deal at the time, Zig Serafin, CEO of Qualtrics, commented:\n\nWe are incredibly excited to partner with the team at Silver Lake, who deeply understand our business and will help us continue to build a high-performing company, invest in our innovation and expand our ecosystem to help our customers succeed.\n\nMore News from Qualtrics\n\nSince the acquisition, Qualtrics has returned to being a private company and has garnered some success.\n\nMost notably, it was named a leading voice of the customer solution in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant, where it was commended for its investment in generative AI (GenAI) and its standout CX, analysis, and insight capabilities.\n\nElsewhere, during its annual X4 event in May, Qualtrics introduced the following three new apps for its XM Platform:\n\nQualtrics Frontline Locations\n\nQualtrics Frontline Digital\n\nQualtrics Frontline Care\n\nThese apps are designed to help frontline staff quickly and effectively build personalized customer connections across in-store, online, and contact center environments.\n\nThe apps also promise to enhance CX at scale by leveraging Qualtrics AI, which is informed by the world’s largest database of human sentiment.",

Medallia aims to enhance AI-driven customer experience with a new leadership team focused on innovation.\n\nMarket confidence. The contact center software market is poised for growth, with a 23.9% CAGR predicted through 2030.\n\nThe new year has brought an executive shakeup in the contact center software space.\n\nMedallia today added five former Qualtrics executives, most notably at the top: Mark Bishof is the new chairman and CEO of Medallia.\n\nBishof most recently served as strategic advisor and chief business officer of Qualtrics, following its 2021 acquisition of Clarabridge. Bishof was CEO of Clarabridge, which also played in this customer experience space before Qualtrics acquired Clarabridge for $1.125 billion in July 2021.\n\nMedallia and Qualtrics play in the contact center, customer and employee experience management software space.\n\nCall it a CX-EX exec shakeup.\n\nMike Lipps was in the Medallia CEO role since April 2024. He took over for Joe Tyrrell, who left for personal reasons. Lipps is remaining on the Medallia board. Lipps’ appointment was only temporary as Medallia seeked a long-term successor, which is now Bishof, a Medallia spokesperson told CMSWire.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNew Medallia Executives With Qualtrics Ties\n\nImpact on Contact Center Software Space\n\nMedallia and Qualtrics: Tale of the Tape\n\nCore Questions Around Medallia's Executive Changes\n\nNew Medallia Executives With Qualtrics Ties\n\nWhat's more: Bishof brings along to Medallia some of his Clarabridge/Qualtrics friends. Four other former Clarabridge/Qualtrics executives in addition to Bishof are now part of Medallia:\n\nSid Banerjee has been appointed chief strategy officer. As former founder of Clarabridge and chief XM strategy officer at Qualtrics XM (Qualtrics XM is the branding for its products), Banerjee has been in customer experience technology for more than 20 years. He will lead the development of Medallia’s AI innovation agenda.\n\nBas Brukx has been appointed chief financial officer. Brukx joins from Therapy Brands, where he served as CFO. He previously held CFO roles at Clarabridge and Allego, the latter which he joined after about a year with Qualtrics.\n\nRam Ramachandran has been appointed chief transformation officer. He was most recently the president of CareJourney and previously served as the chief technology officer of Clarabridge and CTO of Qualtrics XM Discover.\n\nKarl Knoll has been appointed general counsel. He previously served as general counsel of Clarabridge and was a Qualtrics legal consultant for about a year after the Clarabridge acquisition. Prior to that, he was a partner at Womble Bond Dickinson.\n\nIn other executive move, Jamie Hunter has been appointed chief of staff and head of corporate development at Medallia. She most recently served as chief operating officer at Emburse and is the lone executive in the news today not formerly with Qualtrics connections.\n\n“I am thrilled to bring these seasoned industry leaders together and pair them with Medallia’s team and long history of innovation in customer experience and AI,” Bishof said. “The world is changing, and our vision is to accelerate our clients from CX-based surveys and signals to AI-based conversations and automation, enabling them to compete more effectively and gain higher share and delight from their customers.”\n\nRelated Article: Former Microsoft Exec to Join Qualtrics as President of AI Strategy\n\nImpact on Contact Center Software Space\n\nWhat does all this mean for the contact center and customer experience management software space? Naturally the biggest impact would be on Medallia customers. Such a large executive dump could mean new things for product roadmap and company strategy. The incoming executives for Medallia are not insignificant roles, with strategy, roadmap and AI innovation all likely to see change.\n\nAbove all else, think about this news this way: Five major executives with customer experience management and contact center space backgrounds are staying in the same space. That signals confidence in driving customer experience on the front lines, and it's no surprise when you look at the numbers. Grand View Research reported the global contact center software market size was valued at $33.38 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.9% from 2023 to 2030.\n\n\"The increasing demand for enhanced customer experience is expected to significantly drive the market growth,\" researchers reported. \"Businesses understand the importance of providing exceptional customer service and invest in contact center software to streamline customer interactions, improve response times and personalize the customer experience. Moreover, the rise of omnichannel communication is driving the adoption of contact center software.\"\n\nWhat's more: companies like Medallia and Qualtrics need to evolve and innovate — and fast. They're up against a technology world that's moving at light speed because of artificial intelligence. By 2027, Gartner predicts 40% of all customer service issues will be fully resolved by unofficial third-party tools powered by generative AI, according to Gartner, Inc. The Medallias, Qualtrics and companies like NICE of this space have already recognized this AI in customer experience revolution but need to keep up.\n\nConsumers are increasingly adopting unofficial third-party generative tools such as ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews and Apple Intelligence to resolve customer service issues, Gartner notes. \"The deep integration of GenAI into these widely available consumer tools is driving a shift in consumer behavior, as customers prefer these platforms for their convenience and availability. As a result, customer service teams may expect a decline in official first-party service volume,\" according to Gartner.\n\nRelated Article: SAP Sells Qualtrics Shares in $12.5B Acquisition by Silver Lake and CPP Investments\n\nMedallia and Qualtrics: Tale of the Tape\n\nAs for the two CX companies at play here, each company went private after major acquisitions this decade:\n\nThoma Bravo, a software investment firm, announced in July 2021 it had acquired Medallia for $6.4 billion. Medallia, which went public in 2019, reverted back to a private company in the deal. Medallia had been growing steadily and IPO'ed itself in the summer of 2019. The total revenue for fiscal year 2021 was $477.2 million for Medallia, an increase of 19% from the prior year. When it did the same in 2019, the yearly revenue was $313.6 million.\n\nQualtrics, meanwhile, was sold by SAP as part of the company's $12.5 billion acquisition by Silver Lake and CPP Investments in March of 2023. SAP acquired Qualtrics in 2019 for $8 billion. SAP took Qualtrics public in 2021, with a valuation of nearly $21 billion, allowing it to operate independently, yet still retaining ownership over a majority of the stock.\n\nLearning Opportunities\n\nQualtrics and Medallia were both leaders in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Voice of the Customer (VoC) Platforms 2024. They were well ahead of fellow leaders PG Forsta and InMoment. Concentrix was named a visionary; Verint was named a challenger; and Alida, Alchemer, QuestionPro and Pisano all got nods as niche players.\n\nCore Questions Around Medallia's Executive Changes\n\nEditor's note: Here's a summary of two core questions around the topic of Medallia's executive changes:\n\nWho is the CEO of Medallia?\n\nMark Bishof is the new chairman and CEO of Medallia. He previously served as the chief business officer of Qualtrics and was CEO of Clarabridge before its acquisition by Qualtrics in 2021.\n\nWhat impact will executive changes have on Medallia's strategy?\n\nThe appointment of five former Qualtrics executives, including key roles in strategy, AI innovation, and legal, signals a strategic shift toward AI-driven solutions and potential changes in Medallia's product roadmap and company vision. This could influence how Medallia adapts to the rapidly-evolving customer experience software market.",

      "# [Duke renews contract with Qualtrics by Office of Information Technology on 2024-07-15](https://oit.duke.edu/news/duke-renews-contract-qualtrics/)\nThe university has reached an agreement on pricing, and there is no longer a risk of disruption with the Duke University/DKU-wide Qualtrics license at the end of the 2024 year. The new license covers the current volume of Qualtrics survey responses for another 5 years, through Dec 31, 2029.\n\nWho is covered under the new contract?\n\nThe contract that has been under negotiation includes users of the existing University and DKU service, as well as two other services used by the Health System:\n\nAcademic CoreXM (University/DKU)\n\nPatient Experience (Duke Health)\n\nDiscover for Contact Centers DHAS & DPC Triage (Duke Health)\n\nHow much will the new contract cost Duke?\n\nThe 2025 annual cost will be roughly 70 percent more than what the University paid in 2024 and 2.5x the license cost from 2023. However, it is a significant improvement over the initial proposed increase from the vendor which would have amounted to a 6x increase over the life of the contract, relative to 2023. The price now increases by ~3x relative to what the University paid in 2023.\n\nAn additional benefit is that the University now has a five-year contract over which to spread the increase.\n\nThe contract period also gives us more time gaining experience with current survey tools and upcoming tools on the market. We will also need to evaluate whether alternative funding options might be advisable in the future (e.g., for research projects, funding via grants may become an option).\n\nShould Duke researchers using Academic CoreXM still consider other survey tool options?\n\nIt is still important to consider other software for surveys with uncomplicated designs and where tracking longitudinal data is less essential. Duke will soon develop a request process to reduce the number of Qualtrics survey responses and, if necessary, direct them to a more appropriate survey tool. See a list of other survey tools available at Duke here: https://oit.duke.edu/service/survey-tools.\n\nUpdates on the new Qualtrics process will be shared broadly and posted on the OIT website: https://oit.duke.edu/service/qualtrics.\n\nHow do I know which tool is right for me?\n\nThe Office of Information Technology has developed a comparison chart to help Duke community members decide among various survey and forms tools - https://oit.duke.edu/help/articles/kb0037717.",

The recent executive shakeup at Medallia, which involved the appointment of several former Qualtrics executives, highlights the competitive landscape and the ongoing evolution within the industry [(Nicastro, CMSWire, 2025)](https://www.cmswire.com/contact-center/medallia-adds-5-former-qualtrics-execs-including-new-ceo-mark-bishof/).\n\n## User Feedback and Community Insights\n\nUser feedback on platforms like Reddit indicates a mix of opinions regarding Qualtrics' product limitations, such as the recent implementation of a 100-widget limit on dashboards. Users have expressed frustration over this restriction, suggesting that it may hinder their ability to present data effectively [(Qualtrics Community, 2024)](https://community.qualtrics.com/cx-dashboards-8/cx-dashboards-widget-limit-31464). However, the company has been praised for its overall capabilities in experience management.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nQualtrics stands as a robust player in the experience management software market, with a strong focus on innovation and customer success. The recent acquisition and product developments position the company well for future growth. Prospective candidates and investors should consider Qualtrics' strategic direction, market position, and ongoing commitment to enhancing customer experiences through advanced technology."
