The company was founded on January 1, 2002, and is headquartered in Provo, Utah [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/qualtrics). Qualtrics was acquired by SAP in 2019 for $8 billion but was later sold in March 2023 to Silver Lake and CPP Investments for $12.5 billion, allowing it to operate independently [(Medallia's Exec Shakeup, CMSWire, 2025)](https://www.cmswire.com/contact-center/medallia-adds-5-former-qualtrics-execs-including-new-ceo-mark-bishof/).\n\nQualtrics serves over 8,500 enterprises worldwide, including more than 75% of the Fortune 100 and 99 of the top 100 U.S. business schools [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/qualtrics). The company generates revenue by providing its XM platform to a diverse range of clients, primarily in a B2B model. Its customers span various sectors, including healthcare, education, and corporate environments [(Qualtrics on 2024-12-02, Virginia Tech, 2024)](https://software.vt.edu/deptsoftware/qualtrics.html).\n\nThe company's products are distributed through a cloud-based platform, allowing organizations to design surveys, analyze feedback, and derive actionable insights. Qualtrics is known for its user-friendly interface and AI-powered solutions that enhance customer experience across multiple channels [(Qualtrics XM, 2015)](https://www.qualtrics.com/).\n\nQualtrics has been recognized as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Voice of the Customer (VoC) Platforms, highlighting its strong market position [(Medallia's Exec Shakeup, CMSWire, 2025)](https://www.cmswire.com/contact-center/medallia-adds-5-former-qualtrics-execs-including-new-ceo-mark-bishof/).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nWhile specific details about the current leadership team are not provided, it is noted that several former Qualtrics executives joined Medallia in early 2025, including Mark Bishof, who became the CEO and chairman [(Medallia's Exec Shakeup, CMSWire, 2025)](https://www.cmswire.com/contact-center/medallia-adds-5-former-qualtrics-execs-including-new-ceo-mark-bishof/).\n\n# News\n\n## Strategic Partnerships\n\nQualtrics has formed a strategic partnership with Vizient, the largest healthcare performance improvement company in the U.S. This collaboration aims to integrate quality and patient experience data to improve healthcare performance metrics [(Vizient and Qualtrics Announce Strategic Partnership, 2024)](https://www.vizientinc.com/newsroom/news-releases/2024/vizient-and-qualtrics-announce-strategic-partnership-to-develop-predictive-experience-metrics).\n\n## Product Innovations\n\nIn March 2025, Qualtrics launched several AI-powered solutions to enhance customer experience, including Qualtrics AI Assist, Frontline Locations Assist, Frontline Digital, and Frontline Care [(related News from AWS, No Jitter, 2024)](https://www.nojitter.com/ai-automation/no-jitter-roll-another-slew-of-gen-ai-related-news-from-aws-ringcentral-qualtrics-and-avaamo). These innovations are part of Qualtrics' strategy to deliver omnichannel insights and improve customer engagement [(Qualtrics AI Powered Innovations, 2025-03-19)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qualtrics-ai-powered-innovations-deliver-omnichannel-insights-organizations-need-to-win-in-the-next-era-of-agentic-ai-302405462.html).\n\n## Executive Changes\n\nIn early 2025, several former Qualtrics executives transitioned to Medallia, indicating a strategic shift towards AI-driven solutions in the customer experience management space [(Medallia's Exec Shakeup, CMSWire, 2025)](https://www.cmswire.com/contact-center/medallia-adds-5-former-qualtrics-execs-including-new-ceo-mark-bishof/).\n\n## Pricing and Licensing Concerns\n\nQualtrics has faced challenges regarding pricing, with a report from Duke University noting a 50% increase in licensing costs compared to the previous year. This has led Duke to explore alternative solutions and negotiate with Qualtrics to manage costs effectively [(Important News About Qualtrics, Office of Information Technology, 2024)](https://oit.duke.edu/news/important-news-about-qualtrics/).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n- Qualtrics has been actively involved in enhancing AI capabilities, as seen in its partnership with LangChain to improve AI agents [(Qualtrics & LangChain join forces, 2025-03-19)](https://itbrief.co.nz/story/qualtrics-langchain-join-forces-to-enhance-ai-agents).\n- The company has also been involved in transforming K-12 education through a partnership with the State Board of Education [(State Board of Education, Qualtrics partnering, 2025-03-20)](https://www.deseret.com/education/2025/03/20/state-board-of-education-qualtrics-partnering-to-transform-k-12-education/).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nQualtrics continues to be a leader in the experience management space, driven by innovative product offerings and strategic partnerships. However, it faces challenges related to pricing and competition in a rapidly evolving market. The company's focus on AI-driven solutions and partnerships in critical sectors like healthcare may provide significant growth potential in the coming years.",

This license is built for business and has lots of analytics bells and whistles that are useless for research, and it also costs over double the annual subscription cost.\n\nMy SLAC is having a hard time justifying this price hike, so we're looking at alternative platforms.  We need something on par with Qualtrics in terms of question and output types, and the ability to have custom branding would be ideal (i.e. I don't want participants to be redirected to a random SurveyMonkey page after completing the survey).\n\nFor comparison, a site-wide license (unlimited responses) for my college with ~1200 students used to be $7500/year. Now it is limited to 1000 users and 25,000 responses for $15,000/year. We have been able to negotiate both of these prices down a little, but we're still looking at a $5k increase for more-restricted usage.\n\n## Comment ID jfqm2cy with +2 score by [(cequims, Reddit, 2023-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/jfqm2cy/) (in reply to ID 11ss3vs):\nJust got off the phone with our Qualtrics rep, and it's clear they have no interest in serving small businesses.

So far, I'm pretty happy with SurveySparrow. The features are sufficiently complex for just about everything our company needs to do across our many projects. The question options aren't as customizable as Qualtrics, and the automated reports could use a few improvements, but for the drastically lower cost I am happy to make adjustments to work with the available options. I will say that customer service is a bit spotty. They are often (but not always) available right away via their chat feature. I think most of their team is located in India, however, and sometimes time zone differences are an issue. My colleague on Pacific time tends says they often don't get back to her til the next day. I'm on East Coast time, and it's less of an issue. I also sometimes worry that because they are a smaller company, they may be less stable and more likely to have tech issues. For example, I once found that I couldn't edit data on the back end, then the next day it worked. And right now, there's a weird formatting issue where text is overlapping in the footer of the surveys. So there are definitely small signs that they are more scrappy than the big leagues.

Does anyone know why it doesn't work, and how I could get it to do I could create this survey?\nConversely, does anyone know any real alternatives to Qualtrics for data collection?

This license is built for business and has lots of analytics bells and whistles that are useless for research, and it also costs over double the annual subscription cost.\n\nMy SLAC is having a hard time justifying this price hike, so we're looking at alternative platforms.  We need something on par with Qualtrics in terms of question and output types, and the ability to have custom branding would be ideal (i.e. I don't want participants to be redirected to a random SurveyMonkey page after completing the survey).\n\nFor comparison, a site-wide license (unlimited responses) for my college with ~1200 students used to be $7500/year. Now it is limited to 1000 users and 25,000 responses for $15,000/year. We have been able to negotiate both of these prices down a little, but we're still looking at a $5k increase for more-restricted usage.\n\n## Comment ID jcinizm with +7 score by [(cattyditty, Reddit, 2023-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/11ss012/qualtrics_alternatives/jcinizm/) (in reply to ID 11ss012):\nREDCap!

On review sites, they get high marks for being “well-rounded,” but when you dive into market researchers’ opinions, it’s a different story. The pricing complaints are real—it’s not transparent, and you end up paying way more than expected. Plus, customer service issues? Definitely frustrating when you’re dealing with tight deadlines and complex surveys.\n\nI think part of the problem is that Qualtrics has grown so much, and with that comes the loss of personalized support and that sharp focus on survey quality. It’s like they’re trying to be *everything* for *everyone*, and that just doesn’t work when you need reliability and flexibility in your research.\n\nIn my experience, if you’re looking for a solid alternative, SurveySparrow hits a sweet spot. It’s way more intuitive, so you don’t need a specialist breathing down your neck for every little thing. Plus, it’s self-serve, which is what a lot of people here seem to be looking for. You can easily run and manage your surveys without those constant check-ins from a project manager. And with automated workflows, real-time insights, and sentiment analysis baked in, it feels much lighter without sacrificing the important features.\n\nBut yeah, it seems like Qualtrics sticks around because switching can feel like a hassle, and it’s what a lot of agencies are already comfortable with. Still, the cracks are showing, and people are starting to explore other tools.

the quality of the sample provided was so poor that we ended up removing all of the Qualtrics respondents from the final reporting.\n\nSo, that’s why I don’t like Qualtrics.\n\n### Comment ID lp9y2vw with +1 score by [(reallymemorable, Reddit, 2024-09-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lp9y2vw/) (in reply to ID lp39eev):\nWhat platform did you switch to?\n\n#### Comment ID lpwksqm with +1 score by [(jelybely8, Reddit, 2024-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lpwksqm/) (in reply to ID lp9y2vw):\nVoxco\n\n## Comment ID lx4df7p with +2 score by [(shkilo, Reddit, 2024-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lx4df7p/) (in reply to ID 1fijau3):\nIMO their platform has major usability issues and performance issues, and the customer support and account managers are abysmal.\n\nThe whole vibe I get from them...\n\n...from the sloppy and frustrating product design, to the lack of response to feedback provided to them, to their confusing support hub, to their ideation platform that basically ask you how much you'd be willing to pay for a proposed enhancement, to their support callback time estimates being consistently and significantly inaccurate, to their extensive knowledge base that somehow manages to never answer my questions...\n\n...is that they couldn't care less about the experience of their own customers.\n\n## Comment ID lnhospx with +3 score by [(AMKumle24, Reddit, 2024-09-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lnhospx/) (in reply to ID 1fijau3):\nThey also have severe control issues, they always need to have one of their specialists involved with a project, or they force implementation hours on you.\n\n### Comment ID lnjxs2t with +2 score by [(pnutbutterpirate, Reddit, 2024-09-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lnjxs2t/) (in reply to ID lnhospx):\nThis has not been my experience.

The number of surveys I've done that lack page breaks is astounding. Seeing more than about 10 questions on a single page is overwhelming for most people and increases your chances of accidentally skipped questions.\n\nFor question matrices with Likert scale items, ensure that the labels for the response options appear at the top and the middle of the matrix (not just the top). You can change this in question settings. This will help to ensure that respondents don't have to keep scrolling to the top of the page to see the the response options. People will forget what the response options are, especially if you have a larger number of response options. \n\nSet the questions to \"request response\". This will flag skipped questions for participants so they are asked if they want to continue the survey without answering a skipped question. This doesn't work for matrices though.\n\nUse multie blocks as you're setting up your survey. For example, if you have demographics questions, mental health questions, and substance use questions, put all of your demographics questions in one block, your mental health questions in second block, and your substance use questions in a third block.  This is for YOUR sake. It's easier to find/edit/move questions when you have multipe blocks rather than what could be 100+ questions placed into a single block. Using multipe blocks also makes setting up survey flow and skip logic more effective/efficient.\n\n## Comment ID ljzodjv with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-08-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/ljzodjv/) (in reply to ID 101qloz):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID lkbuqjj with +1 score by [(barrybulsara, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/lkbuqjj/) (in reply to ID ljzodjv):\n/u/Odd-Courage- is a bot account.\n\n## Comment ID lk4rvn9 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/lk4rvn9/) (in reply to ID 101qloz):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID lkbuj74 with +1 score by [(barrybulsara, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/lkbuj74/) (in reply to ID lk4rvn9):\n/u/Odd-Courage- is a bot account.\n\n## Comment ID j2qfltq with +1 score by [(Decent-Reception-232, Reddit, 2023-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/j2qfltq/) (in reply to ID 101qloz):\n1.

If you check the URL to see the specific group associated with your Qualtrics surveys, you can get better at filtering out the crappy ones and letting the good ones through.\n\n## Comment ID f9ea0is with +1 score by [(bearjew96, Reddit, 2019-12-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwagBucks/comments/e469mp/qualtrics_micro_survey_scams/f9ea0is/) (in reply to ID e469mp):\nYeah Qualtrics surveys have constantly been redirecting me after completion to another survey.

I am a UI/UX designer and web developer.\n\nAfter seeing her work with Qualtrics and before that with SurveyMonkey, I think there's room for a platform that would **better embrace the specificities of scientific research** (automatic pairing of the data from a dyad, anonymization of the data, easy way to export **clean** data to SPSS or SAS, etc).\n\nI'm even considering building one myself with a couple friend-developers.\n\nWould you have any interest in such a platform?

It's easier on the eyes. However, REDCap is ideal for research projects across the board (e.g. clinical trials to social behavioral/psychology, or even a basic survey for any need), and allows for longitudinal tracking of participants or cohorts, which Qualtrics lacks. That is why some major research institutions use REDCap over Qualtrics (though I've worked on projects that used both). Having a singular record that corresponds to one participant to track several types of surveys and data over time is a huge advantage over Qualtrics.\n\n#### Comment ID hmc63mm with +1 score by [(Sighann, Reddit, 2021-11-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/qw6pe4/room_for_an_alternative_to_qualtrics/hmc63mm/) (in reply to ID hl2qiza):\nI've used both and agree Qualtrics is overall the better tool - it is more intuitive, has better question logic, a better user interface, and graphics output.  However, an individual license is ˜$1300 and I assume this is something this individual does not have access to. The free version of Qualtrics does not allow for data downloads making it useless for research.\n\nWe rely on REDCap as a database and scheduled measures tool, I am not sure about Qualtrics' abilities here. Our institution has also cleared REDCap to add results directly to patients charts which for our purposes makes a huge difference. Although it's more basic, the REDCap development team have been very helpful and made changes to the source code to accommodate some of our needs, and it took them less than a week!\n\n### Comment ID hl4kl8w with +2 score by [(_Jii_, Reddit, 2021-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/qw6pe4/room_for_an_alternative_to_qualtrics/hl4kl8w/) (in reply to ID hl111x5):\nThank you for pointing REDCap out.

Remember, Qualtrics has servers and certifications and data security stuff. You might ask your wife who picks the service, then reconsider your target. That is, if it is chosen at the university level, chances are the university is going to go with a big enterprise solution, not a little start-up. If it is the department-level, same thing, but you might have more of an in if you have a great product. If it's at the lab level, then you could potentially make inroads, but then what about scalability? Would it be actually worth it? \n\n>automatic pairing of the data from a dyad, anonymization of the data, easy way to export clean data to SPSS or SAS, etc\n\nYou can already do this with Qualtrics.  \nHow skilled a Qualtrics user is your wife? I'm not trying to throw shade, I'm just saying that if you are judging Qualtrics' functionality based off the use-patterns of a novice or even intermediate user, maybe you're not getting the full picture of what Qualtrics can do. It's a very versatile system and an advanced user can get a huge amount of functionality out of it.  \n\nBut yeah, you can do those things already. Pairing data between dyads would take some thought, but you can definitely do that. Anonymization is built into Qualtrics; it's a check-box you can check off so we're not talking custom javascript or anything complex. Exporting data is basic functionality and is already clean so I'm not sure what you mean.\n\n### Comment ID hl4t49x with +3 score by [(_Jii_, Reddit, 2021-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/qw6pe4/room_for_an_alternative_to_qualtrics/hl4t49x/) (in reply to ID hl2gwk7):\nThank you for your input! Safety is definitely a matter that should not be skimped on and I believe it is manageable. Same goes for scalability.My wife is well recognized in her field of study and has good funding. She pays for her own license (something her department could not afford). Nevertheless, I consider her to be a novice with Qualtrics. And I think she will remain so. Most of her time is dedicated to research, not learning a new platform.\n\nAs for “clean data” I had in mind the output of matrix questions not being properly encoded when exported. It happened several times with Qualtrics. Maybe a novice mistake. But definitely something she’s annoyed by and that other users might be experiencing too. I also had in mind the fact that she has to through all the answers one by one to identify the ones answered too quickly, randomly or where the answer is always “yes”. I’m not saying Qualtrics is unable to do that (it probably does). But I think a good software should point those out more clearly, in a user friendly fashion.\n\n#### Comment ID hl52ord with +1 score by [(andero, Reddit, 2021-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/qw6pe4/room_for_an_alternative_to_qualtrics/hl52ord/) (in reply to ID hl4t49x):\nYeah, that sounds like novice Qualtrics problems to me. \n\nI guess the thing is, if she isn't willing to learn the platform she has, why would she (or other people like her) be willing to learn your new platform?\n\nIn other words, if a person has problems exporting clean data from Qualtrics, they're going to have problems exporting clean data *from any platform*. As a software person, you know that what you think of as clean data is data that is exported using a specified format and following that format. Qualtrics already does that. If the user is unwilling to learn the format and unwilling to set up their use of the platform with an understanding of the format, it really doesn't matter what the format *is* because the user isn't going to learn it.\n\nChances are, you could write a quick script in any language you know to reformat the data Qualtrics gives you into whatever format your wife wants. That would be a lot faster than building a whole new platform just because she's unwilling to learn the functionality of this one.  \n\n>she has to through all the answers one by one to identify the ones answered too quickly, randomly or where the answer is always “yes”.  \n>As a web developer though, going through 600 lines in a spreadsheet to spot check “sketchy” answers makes no sense. A good software should point out items answered too quickly or always with the first option, etc.\n\nAgain, this is your wife being a novice. There is already a way to do this in Qualtrics. You could also do with a script that would be trivially easy to write. There is probably a way to do this in SPSS, too; I use R to analyze so I'm not sure.\n\nBut yeah... sounds like this is a \"your wife doesn't want to learn software\" issue, not a \"software is limited\" issue. Qualtrics does everything your wife needs, but she isn't willing to learn it. The solution to that problem is not \"build a whole new platform\".\n\n## Comment ID hl13ky4 with +16 score by [(1n_pla1n_s1ght, Reddit, 2021-11-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/qw6pe4/room_for_an_alternative_to_qualtrics/hl13ky4/) (in reply to ID qw6pe4):\nHere's my take: \n\nAs a young researcher who just wanted to push a button and have all that done for me because learning it was hard, yes I would have jumped at the chance to have that.\n\nAs an older researcher who doesn't trust automated processes like this since they are often not transparent and if there's an issue in the process I can't identify it myself, no I don't want that. Especially if it is about anonymization which could go seriously wrong if the program did it incorrectly and I wasn't aware of it. \n\nThese are all steps for which there is usually no one way to do things right and the right way is dependent on the study and researcher preferences. Basic data cleaning isn't crazy hard and should be done based on researcher insight not on external algorithms. Does data cleaning suck? Yes. Are there sometimes insights to be gained when doing this which would be missed if the process was automated? Also yes. \n\nI've worked with data from Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey, Limesurvey, Sawtooth, Formdesk, Google Forms, and other private survey companies, and they all suck uniquely in their own way. Most of the suck goes away with experience programming the surveys properly to begin with. Most of the issues I've had have been when I trusted other companies to program stuff for me. So I would say no, there's no need for a platform like this and the big risk is over-reliance of younger researchers on button pushing rather than understanding processes.\n\nBut the real takeaway is this: your wife is a professor, she should be having graduate students doing this for her since they need the experience. Tell her to farm out the work next time and focus on the important stuff like getting grant money to hire more graduate students to do this work for her.\n\n### Comment ID hl4z4th with +1 score by [(_Jii_, Reddit, 2021-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/qw6pe4/room_for_an_alternative_to_qualtrics/hl4z4th/) (in reply to ID hl13ky4):\nThank you for your honest feedback.

Qualtrics is also well-established and has good support, so I think it’d be a hard sell.\n\n\r  \nThere’s a possible parallel with statistics software. Historically, SPSS has been widely used in psychology departments, but some are ditching it in favour of free alternatives like Jamovi or R. I’d say that Jamovi hits a sweet spot in terms of how user friendly it is, but part of that is that it does a relatively small number of things. SPSS is bloated with things that 99.9% of psychology undergraduates will never use. But if you need those features, and/or if you know where to find the things you need, then it's not really an issue and it's hard to justify the time required to learn something else.\n\n\r  \nThere is a learning curve to Qualtrics, but that’s probably unavoidable with something that has as much functionality as it does. People are going to complain about it if they can’t do the things they want to do immediately – we’re all busy people and faffing around with software doesn’t count for much – but having less features isn’t a great selling point to experienced users.\n\n### Comment ID hl5cjw5 with +2 score by [(_Jii_, Reddit, 2021-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/qw6pe4/room_for_an_alternative_to_qualtrics/hl5cjw5/) (in reply to ID hl3p8ne):\n>so the only way to compete in that space is to either be more user-friendly and/or cheaper.\n\nTotally agree.\n\nAnd I would add taking into account the fact that the new platform, if it ever exists, is dedicated to **academic research**. By going through Qualtrics website I understand it's more of an *appreciation survey* tool. They even rebranded their name to XM (experience management). A very powerful one I'll admit, but still.\n\nClearly there  must be differences between academic research and marketing research and that's what I'm trying to figure out.\n\nAny cues? :)\n\n## Comment ID hl3ppcj with +1 score by [(bobbyfiend, Reddit, 2021-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/qw6pe4/room_for_an_alternative_to_qualtrics/hl3ppcj/) (in reply to ID qw6pe4):\nFrankly, Qualtrics but cheaper.

I have a bunch of kids who participate in ice sports at the Oval and the team's treatment of the youth there is outrageous. Players do not say hello back to the children nor even smile at them. I have had staff tell me to not let my very young child \"look\" at the players during a practice in a very public place where they are the guest (until South Towne Mall practice facility is ready). Staff and players speed through the parking lot after dark when many young children are coming and going for their sports. They have the walking track blocked off nearly daily for no reason at all, making that unusable to patrons. \n\nI was also a little taken aback by the ticket prices for the games.

By the time the break-even point is approached, suddenly the stadium/arena needs major upgrades and can't possibly be done without even more public money and if the city doesn't pay up they'll relocate. Repeat ad nauseam.\n\nAll of the \"studies\" that show how much local revenue and jobs are generated by these things ignore that the vast majority of that money would be spent locally anyway, because the vast majority of people attending the events are the local population.

Big layoffs recently, many jobs moved to lower cost locations and other countries, no leadership accountability whatsoever. Total chaos followed. RTO enforcement coming. Pay cuts (or absence of refreshers) likely coming. Everyone good is looking to leave soon. Product is also incredibly boring to work on although I don't personally mind as long as working hours stay low. Not a single person in the C-suite deserves to be there. They are driving the company away from being a survey platform (which we excel at) to being a management suggestion tool (which we're bad at and customers don't need). They set on this path when the economy was good, and many customers were shelling out for a luxury product and making decisions based on employee and customer feedback. But now that the tech economy is bad, decision making is driven only by profit, making Qualtrics' experience management insights irrelevant. For example, Qualtrics can tell Delta that customers want extra leg room on flights. But Delta doesn't care, they need the money from those 3 extra rows. It is a rare case when Qualtrics can provide an insight that 1.) is novel and 2.) is actionable in a profitable way.",

And with full realization that no one is perfect, and success is messy and employees can't just blame management for their own shortcomings and should look in the mirror more often. Guilty as charged.  But management seems to be missing just one critical awareness.\n\nSome things even XM can't measure.  X Data helps, but it will never tell the whole story. Do things to build trust and connection and social capital that don't make sense on your financial statements.  Don't tell the employees that they wanted more money and less parties based on their own survey responses. Give them both.  Don't remind them that it will all be worth it because of the money they will make and the financial strategy for the stage of growth and the market we are in, and this new level of chess that private equity is taking us to. That will not fix the core structural issue that the people at this company are not as connected with a sense of meaning and belonging as deeply as they used to be even if on the engagement surveys lots of people say they have a best friend at the organization, and they like their manager.    The cost of ignoring that unseen disconnection, far outweighs any \"frivolous\" expense incurred to foster relationships again.  In my experience, Qualtrics is made up of some of the most brilliant and great people in the world who want to work hard and be consistent and inclusive and do what is right and celebrate together when they all get rich or richer if they catch the curve right and persevere.  They are proud to work there and of what Qualtrics can do and the impact its having in the world, and are willing to stick with it through almost anything and forgive all the mistakes and let downs and overpromises while they watch executives who urged them to play the long game, strategically take their shares and run.  But it seems like despite all your knowledge and experience and resources and expertise and the respect of your brand, you are messing up one thing that you can't mess up...\n\nYou can't be customer-obsessed if you don't treat every single one of your employees as your most important customers.  \n\nAccountability can co-exist with this, and you can keep your investors happy. And the employees are not usually as spoiled or entitled or ungrateful as they might seem.  They are just tired and disconnected.  Don't just say that employee experience engagement has gotten better based on quarter-over-quarter survey results.   No one cares.  Its interesting insight, but no one who is not responsible for that number actually cares about that number.  And its only going to frustrate them  to hear that win if they don't feel it.  It has to be something shared and palpable that only a human can sense. Use AI and stats and surveys and dashboards for everything else.  Make the investors happy.  But go back to making the employees first.  That's how you got here.  Thanks for all the years and work and risks taken you have provided and sacrificed to make it possible.  You deserve it.  No shame.  Just consider it.",

They had a harder and harder time adapting to their own rapid and relentless growth and success as time went on. I think they tried hard, but it just had so much unchecked momentum, that it became chaotic and disjointed to respond to the sheer amount of work and demand it created. Hiring more rapidly didn't fix the problem. There was a lot of collateral damage in the operational cohesiveness and culture of one team that was previously in the org. Lots of conflicting incentives had gradually developed that didn't get addressed enough or mapped or aligned very well along the way, so the individuals who desperately needed to work together with a benevolent mindset across departments had progressively lower natural motivation or patience to keep playing as a team. But they are working on it.",

          "cons": "My time at Qualtrics was marked by a significant lack of growth opportunities. Promotions appeared to favor a select group of employees, and if you weren’t part of the \"right\" group, chances are, advancement would pass you by. It felt like the promotion system was more about who you knew or who you were close to, rather than actual performance or merit.\n\nFeedback was a rare commodity, even when actively requested. Despite asking for guidance to improve, it felt like feedback was withheld or given in vague, unhelpful terms. On top of that, toxic positivity ran rampant, with the company pushing an unrealistic, overly optimistic narrative that made it hard to address real issues or challenges. It’s ironic for a company that prides itself on gathering and acting on employee feedback—because, in reality, they don’t actually listen to it.\n\nThe leadership team often made promises about product features and improvements that never came to fruition, creating challenges in supporting clients and making the job even harder. Role expectations were also in constant flux, and responsibilities were often shifted or combined in ways that didn’t align with what people were hired to do.\n\nAdditionally, the company’s culture is heavily influenced by Mormon principles, which adds another layer of complexity to the work environment. Senior leadership is disconnected from the day-to-day reality, and there’s little accountability for the decisions that directly impact employees. The work environment can feel like a toxic mix of favoritism and a lack of support, where only a certain group of people seem to get the recognition and opportunities they deserve.\n\nThe company made the decision to bring employees back into the office, but the Chicago office is not equipped to handle it. There’s not enough space for the teams on their assigned days, and the office is incredibly loud, making it hard to focus or get work done. \n\nOn top of that, if you express any dissatisfaction or frustration, the senior leadership team has referred to us as \"free agents,\" suggesting that if we’re unhappy, we have the option to leave. This approach only highlights the disconnect between leadership and employees, making it feel like our concerns are dismissed rather than addressed.\n\nIf you're considering working here, I strongly recommend paying attention to the most upvoted and recent reviews. Many of the positive reviews seem to be written in response to negative feedback, which may be an attempt to cover up the company’s deeper issues.",

        "cons": "Qualtrics has been circling the drain for a while now. Private equity bought the company out this past summer and has been slowly gutting it. Big layoffs recently, many jobs moved to lower cost locations and other countries, no leadership accountability whatsoever. Total chaos followed. RTO enforcement coming. Pay cuts (or absence of refreshers) likely coming. Everyone good is looking to leave soon. Product is also incredibly boring to work on although I don't personally mind as long as working hours stay low. Not a single person in the C-suite deserves to be there. They are driving the company away from being a survey platform (which we excel at) to being a management suggestion tool (which we're bad at and customers don't need). They set on this path when the economy was good, and many customers were shelling out for a luxury product and making decisions based on employee and customer feedback. But now that the tech economy is bad, decision making is driven only by profit, making Qualtrics' experience management insights irrelevant. For example, Qualtrics can tell Delta that customers want extra leg room on flights. But Delta doesn't care, they need the money from those 3 extra rows. It is a rare case when Qualtrics can provide an insight that 1.) is novel and 2.) is actionable in a profitable way.",

The C-Suite and upper management does not care about the people that work under them. As long as they are putting more money in their pockets they do not care that they are eliminating hundreds of jobs. 2 huge layoffs in one year with more to come. Zig reads off a script to tell hundreds of people that they don't have a job anymore. They do not listen to their employees. You can be a top performer and still not have job security.

        "advice": "I say this with all due respect and gratitude and empathy for how much they do care and want everyone to win and are trying. And with full realization that no one is perfect, and success is messy and employees can't just blame management for their own shortcomings and should look in the mirror more often. Guilty as charged.  But management seems to be missing just one critical awareness.\n\nSome things even XM can't measure.  X Data helps, but it will never tell the whole story. Do things to build trust and connection and social capital that don't make sense on your financial statements.  Don't tell the employees that they wanted more money and less parties based on their own survey responses. Give them both.  Don't remind them that it will all be worth it because of the money they will make and the financial strategy for the stage of growth and the market we are in, and this new level of chess that private equity is taking us to. That will not fix the core structural issue that the people at this company are not as connected with a sense of meaning and belonging as deeply as they used to be even if on the engagement surveys lots of people say they have a best friend at the organization, and they like their manager.    The cost of ignoring that unseen disconnection, far outweighs any \"frivolous\" expense incurred to foster relationships again.  In my experience, Qualtrics is made up of some of the most brilliant and great people in the world who want to work hard and be consistent and inclusive and do what is right and celebrate together when they all get rich or richer if they catch the curve right and persevere.  They are proud to work there and of what Qualtrics can do and the impact its having in the world, and are willing to stick with it through almost anything and forgive all the mistakes and let downs and overpromises while they watch executives who urged them to play the long game, strategically take their shares and run.  But it seems like despite all your knowledge and experience and resources and expertise and the respect of your brand, you are messing up one thing that you can't mess up...\n\nYou can't be customer-obsessed if you don't treat every single one of your employees as your most important customers.  \n\nAccountability can co-exist with this, and you can keep your investors happy. And the employees are not usually as spoiled or entitled or ungrateful as they might seem.  They are just tired and disconnected.  Don't just say that employee experience engagement has gotten better based on quarter-over-quarter survey results.   No one cares.  Its interesting insight, but no one who is not responsible for that number actually cares about that number.  And its only going to frustrate them  to hear that win if they don't feel it.  It has to be something shared and palpable that only a human can sense. Use AI and stats and surveys and dashboards for everything else.  Make the investors happy.  But go back to making the employees first.  That's how you got here.  Thanks for all the years and work and risks taken you have provided and sacrificed to make it possible.  You deserve it.  No shame.  Just consider it.",
        "cons": "Take this with a grain of salt. But they forfeited their internal culture to keep winning bigger and faster. I hope they get it back. They had a harder and harder time adapting to their own rapid and relentless growth and success as time went on. I think they tried hard, but it just had so much unchecked momentum, that it became chaotic and disjointed to respond to the sheer amount of work and demand it created. Hiring more rapidly didn't fix the problem. There was a lot of collateral damage in the operational cohesiveness and culture of one team that was previously in the org. Lots of conflicting incentives had gradually developed that didn't get addressed enough or mapped or aligned very well along the way, so the individuals who desperately needed to work together with a benevolent mindset across departments had progressively lower natural motivation or patience to keep playing as a team. But they are working on it.",

        "cons": "My time at Qualtrics was marked by a significant lack of growth opportunities. Promotions appeared to favor a select group of employees, and if you weren’t part of the \"right\" group, chances are, advancement would pass you by. It felt like the promotion system was more about who you knew or who you were close to, rather than actual performance or merit.\n\nFeedback was a rare commodity, even when actively requested. Despite asking for guidance to improve, it felt like feedback was withheld or given in vague, unhelpful terms. On top of that, toxic positivity ran rampant, with the company pushing an unrealistic, overly optimistic narrative that made it hard to address real issues or challenges. It’s ironic for a company that prides itself on gathering and acting on employee feedback—because, in reality, they don’t actually listen to it.\n\nThe leadership team often made promises about product features and improvements that never came to fruition, creating challenges in supporting clients and making the job even harder. Role expectations were also in constant flux, and responsibilities were often shifted or combined in ways that didn’t align with what people were hired to do.\n\nAdditionally, the company’s culture is heavily influenced by Mormon principles, which adds another layer of complexity to the work environment. Senior leadership is disconnected from the day-to-day reality, and there’s little accountability for the decisions that directly impact employees. The work environment can feel like a toxic mix of favoritism and a lack of support, where only a certain group of people seem to get the recognition and opportunities they deserve.\n\nThe company made the decision to bring employees back into the office, but the Chicago office is not equipped to handle it. There’s not enough space for the teams on their assigned days, and the office is incredibly loud, making it hard to focus or get work done. \n\nOn top of that, if you express any dissatisfaction or frustration, the senior leadership team has referred to us as \"free agents,\" suggesting that if we’re unhappy, we have the option to leave. This approach only highlights the disconnect between leadership and employees, making it feel like our concerns are dismissed rather than addressed.\n\nIf you're considering working here, I strongly recommend paying attention to the most upvoted and recent reviews. Many of the positive reviews seem to be written in response to negative feedback, which may be an attempt to cover up the company’s deeper issues.",

I am hesitant to move forward with this because it says ALL data connected with user will be lost.\n\nDoes that include previous survey responses? I am under the impression that it is any surveys that they may have owned but am looking more specifically about data loss. Any clarity would be appreciated!\n\nHello ​@haileygarcia,\n\nYes, When you delete a user in Qualtrics, all data associated with that user, including their survey responses, contact lists and any other data in their account, will be permanently deleted. This means that any surveys they owned and the responses collected through those surveys will also be lost.\n\nIf you want to avoid data loss, you can transfer the ownership of their surveys to another user before deleting the account.\n\nLet me know if this helps.",

      "# [Weird behaviour after changing label position in slider questions](https://community.qualtrics.com/survey-platform-54/weird-behaviour-after-changing-label-position-in-slider-questions-31841)\nHi all\n\nI have multiple slider questions throughout my survey and the same behaviour emerges throughout. I wanted to change the position of the labels for my slider question. I used the following to move the labels:\n\nQualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnload(function()\n\n{\n\njQuery(\".numbers li\").hide();\n\nvar labels = jQuery(\"#\"+this.questionId+\" ul.labels\");\n\nif (labels.length > 0 && jQuery(\"div.slider-container\").length > 0) {\n\nlabels.insertAfter(\"div.slider-container\");\n\nlabels.css('font-weight', '700');\n\n}\n\n});\n\nWhen I preview the question on its own, it works like a charm!\n\nBut, when I preview the block or test out the survey after it is published, this is what happens:\n\nImmediately below this question, I have a second, similar question which uses the following (identical to the first):\n\nQualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnload(function()\n\n{\n\njQuery(\".numbers li\").hide();\n\nvar labels = jQuery(\"#\"+this.questionId+\" ul.labels\");\n\nif (labels.length > 0 && jQuery(\"div.slider-container\").length > 0) {\n\nlabels.insertAfter(\"div.slider-container\");\n\nlabels.css('font-weight', '700');\n\n}\n\n});\n\nAgain, previewing the question on its own works fine but here it is only producing two labels when it is in the published form. This slider question and the first one referenced in this post are literally immediately after one another in the same block.\n\nCan anyone tell me what’s happening here? Why is it tripling/doubling the labels like that? If there is a mistake in my java code, please feel free to correct it and post the corrected code. Alternative work-arounds would also be welcome!",

The licensing costs for Qualtrics has already increased by 50 percent compared to last year, and initial indications from the vendor suggests they may further increase the price by three times.\n\nGiven the widespread use of Qualtrics across various departments and organizations at Duke, we are adopting a multi-pronged approach and comprehensive strategy to:\n\nContinue negotiations with the vendor to reduce costs\n\nAnalyze the usage patterns and specific needs of heavy users throughout Duke and DKU\n\nExplore alternative solutions, both currently utilized at Duke/DKU and potentially new options.\n\nMore information will be forthcoming in the coming weeks. We invite you to to participate in one of two upcoming Zoom sessions. These sessions will provide an update on Duke's contract negotiations, discuss what's at stake, introduce alternative solutions such as Microsoft Office 365 Forms, Google Workspace Forms, and Kuali Build.

For example, one of our departments has 10 action plans created, but the dashboard is only showing 4.\n\nI’ve checked the permissions and the metrics for the dashboard and individual who has loaded the action plans onto the system. I did see that some of their action plans are in progress, but at 0%, but this hasn’t been a factor in the past, when counting for the overall actions plans.\n\nDoes anyone know how I can fix this issue, without having to do an action plan export and count on Excel?",

How do I over come this?\n\nI have tried changing the field in the CSV to text, that works for the ID however the DOB does not work if I do this, is there anyway to get around this.\n\nThanks\n\nIf anyone else has the issue, the work around was to create and extra column, convert the DOB e.g. 06/11/2004 with formula =TEXT(A1, “DDMMYYYY”), then when converted to the CSV it keeps the ‘0’ at the beginning of the DOB and becomes 06112004",

Medallia appoints Mark Bishof as CEO and chairman, bringing along four other former Qualtrics executives.\n\nStrategic evolution. Medallia aims to enhance AI-driven customer experience with a new leadership team focused on innovation.\n\nMarket confidence. The contact center software market is poised for growth, with a 23.9% CAGR predicted through 2030.\n\nThe new year has brought an executive shakeup in the contact center software space.\n\nMedallia today added five former Qualtrics executives, most notably at the top: Mark Bishof is the new chairman and CEO of Medallia.\n\nBishof most recently served as strategic advisor and chief business officer of Qualtrics, following its 2021 acquisition of Clarabridge. Bishof was CEO of Clarabridge, which also played in this customer experience space before Qualtrics acquired Clarabridge for $1.125 billion in July 2021.\n\nMedallia and Qualtrics play in the contact center, customer and employee experience management software space.\n\nCall it a CX-EX exec shakeup.\n\nMike Lipps was in the Medallia CEO role since April 2024. He took over for Joe Tyrrell, who left for personal reasons. Lipps is remaining on the Medallia board. Lipps’ appointment was only temporary as Medallia seeked a long-term successor, which is now Bishof, a Medallia spokesperson told CMSWire.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNew Medallia Executives With Qualtrics Ties\n\nImpact on Contact Center Software Space\n\nMedallia and Qualtrics: Tale of the Tape\n\nCore Questions Around Medallia's Executive Changes\n\nNew Medallia Executives With Qualtrics Ties\n\nWhat's more: Bishof brings along to Medallia some of his Clarabridge/Qualtrics friends. Four other former Clarabridge/Qualtrics executives in addition to Bishof are now part of Medallia:\n\nSid Banerjee has been appointed chief strategy officer. As former founder of Clarabridge and chief XM strategy officer at Qualtrics XM (Qualtrics XM is the branding for its products), Banerjee has been in customer experience technology for more than 20 years. He will lead the development of Medallia’s AI innovation agenda.\n\nBas Brukx has been appointed chief financial officer. Brukx joins from Therapy Brands, where he served as CFO. He previously held CFO roles at Clarabridge and Allego, the latter which he joined after about a year with Qualtrics.\n\nRam Ramachandran has been appointed chief transformation officer. He was most recently the president of CareJourney and previously served as the chief technology officer of Clarabridge and CTO of Qualtrics XM Discover.\n\nKarl Knoll has been appointed general counsel. He previously served as general counsel of Clarabridge and was a Qualtrics legal consultant for about a year after the Clarabridge acquisition. Prior to that, he was a partner at Womble Bond Dickinson.\n\nIn other executive move, Jamie Hunter has been appointed chief of staff and head of corporate development at Medallia. She most recently served as chief operating officer at Emburse and is the lone executive in the news today not formerly with Qualtrics connections.\n\n“I am thrilled to bring these seasoned industry leaders together and pair them with Medallia’s team and long history of innovation in customer experience and AI,” Bishof said. “The world is changing, and our vision is to accelerate our clients from CX-based surveys and signals to AI-based conversations and automation, enabling them to compete more effectively and gain higher share and delight from their customers.”\n\nRelated Article: Former Microsoft Exec to Join Qualtrics as President of AI Strategy\n\nImpact on Contact Center Software Space\n\nWhat does all this mean for the contact center and customer experience management software space? Naturally the biggest impact would be on Medallia customers. Such a large executive dump could mean new things for product roadmap and company strategy. The incoming executives for Medallia are not insignificant roles, with strategy, roadmap and AI innovation all likely to see change.\n\nAbove all else, think about this news this way: Five major executives with customer experience management and contact center space backgrounds are staying in the same space. That signals confidence in driving customer experience on the front lines, and it's no surprise when you look at the numbers. Grand View Research reported the global contact center software market size was valued at $33.38 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.9% from 2023 to 2030.\n\n\"The increasing demand for enhanced customer experience is expected to significantly drive the market growth,\" researchers reported. \"Businesses understand the importance of providing exceptional customer service and invest in contact center software to streamline customer interactions, improve response times and personalize the customer experience. Moreover, the rise of omnichannel communication is driving the adoption of contact center software.\"\n\nWhat's more: companies like Medallia and Qualtrics need to evolve and innovate — and fast. They're up against a technology world that's moving at light speed because of artificial intelligence. By 2027, Gartner predicts 40% of all customer service issues will be fully resolved by unofficial third-party tools powered by generative AI, according to Gartner, Inc. The Medallias, Qualtrics and companies like NICE of this space have already recognized this AI in customer experience revolution but need to keep up.\n\nConsumers are increasingly adopting unofficial third-party generative tools such as ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews and Apple Intelligence to resolve customer service issues, Gartner notes. \"The deep integration of GenAI into these widely available consumer tools is driving a shift in consumer behavior, as customers prefer these platforms for their convenience and availability. As a result, customer service teams may expect a decline in official first-party service volume,\" according to Gartner.\n\nRelated Article: SAP Sells Qualtrics Shares in $12.5B Acquisition by Silver Lake and CPP Investments\n\nMedallia and Qualtrics: Tale of the Tape\n\nAs for the two CX companies at play here, each company went private after major acquisitions this decade:\n\nThoma Bravo, a software investment firm, announced in July 2021 it had acquired Medallia for $6.4 billion. Medallia, which went public in 2019, reverted back to a private company in the deal. Medallia had been growing steadily and IPO'ed itself in the summer of 2019. The total revenue for fiscal year 2021 was $477.2 million for Medallia, an increase of 19% from the prior year. When it did the same in 2019, the yearly revenue was $313.6 million.\n\nQualtrics, meanwhile, was sold by SAP as part of the company's $12.5 billion acquisition by Silver Lake and CPP Investments in March of 2023. SAP acquired Qualtrics in 2019 for $8 billion. SAP took Qualtrics public in 2021, with a valuation of nearly $21 billion, allowing it to operate independently, yet still retaining ownership over a majority of the stock.\n\nQualtrics and Medallia were both leaders in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Voice of the Customer (VoC) Platforms 2024. They were well ahead of fellow leaders PG Forsta and InMoment. Concentrix was named a visionary; Verint was named a challenger; and Alida, Alchemer, QuestionPro and Pisano all got nods as niche players.\n\nCore Questions Around Medallia's Executive Changes\n\nEditor's note: Here's a summary of two core questions around the topic of Medallia's executive changes:\n\nWho is the CEO of Medallia?\n\nMark Bishof is the new chairman and CEO of Medallia. He previously served as the chief business officer of Qualtrics and was CEO of Clarabridge before its acquisition by Qualtrics in 2021.\n\nLearning Opportunities\n\nWhat impact will executive changes have on Medallia's strategy?\n\nThe appointment of five former Qualtrics executives, including key roles in strategy, AI innovation, and legal, signals a strategic shift toward AI-driven solutions and potential changes in Medallia's product roadmap and company vision. This could influence how Medallia adapts to the rapidly-evolving customer experience software market.",

Leading off this week, we highlight: The general availability of Amazon Q from AWS; a new generative AI feature in Amazon Connect's Contact Lens; Talkmap's Gen AI updates to its TalkDiscovery platform; new APIs from RingCentral for AI, video and social media, as well as a workflow builder.\n\nAlso, Qualtrics launched several CX-specific solutions based on its Qualtrics AI Assist product; Avaamo launched an agent assist product for the contact center; and, SymphonyAI debuted a Gen AI copilot targeted at employees and IT staff.\n\nLastly, in the one piece of non-AI news, Calendly introduced a new Web browser extension that helps streamline meeting workflows.\n\nAmazon Q from AWS Becomes Generally Available\n\nAnnounced in late 2023, Amazon Q is now generally available. Amazon Q is a generative AI-based assistant. It is available in two broad categories: Developer and Business.\n\nAmazon Q Business\n\nAmazon Q Business can answer questions, provide summaries, generate content, and securely complete tasks based on data and information in enterprise systems. Q Business:\n\nAmazon Q Developer\n\nAmazon Q Developer assists developers and other IT professionals in several ways. First, Q will generate code suggestions and recommendations in near real time while developers are coding. Customizations are private and the underlying foundation model does not use them for training.\n\nAWS noted that one of its customers, BT Group, said it accepted 37% of Q’s code suggestions while another, National Australia Bank reported 50% acceptance rates. Q can leverage a customer’s internal code base to provide more relevant and useful code recommendations.\n\nQ has another capability, called agents, which can autonomously perform various tasks, such as implementing features, documenting and refactoring code, or performing software upgrades. For example, a human developer can ask the agent to implement an application feature and the agent will then analyze existing application code and generate a step-by-step implementation plan. The human can then review and iterate on that plan before the agent implements.Lastly, Q Developer can scan code for vulnerabilities and suggest remediations. It will also help IT professional optimize and troubleshoot their AWS environment.\n\nWant to know more?\n\nCheck out analyst Sheila McGee-Smith’s thoughts on what Amazon Q brings to Amazon Connect (published in December 2023).\n\nAt Amazon Connect’s Contact Center Day, AWS announced a new generative AI feature in preview in Amazon Connect Contact Lens. The new feature provides managers with generative AI-powered recommendations for answers to questions in agent evaluation forms. Managers receive additional agent behavioral insights (e.g., did the agent show empathy while delivering bad news?) and will get context and justification for the recommended answers (i.e., reference points from the transcript that were used to provide answers).\n\nThese gen AI-powered recommendations are built using Amazon Bedrock and are available in the US West (Oregon) and US East (North Virginia) regions in the English language. During preview, this feature is included with Contact Lens performance evaluations at no additional charge. To learn more, visit Amazon Connect’s documentation and webpage.\n\nTalkmap Unveils TalkDiscovery Version 8.3\n\nThe provider of generative AI-powered contact center solutions announced version 8.3 of its TalkDiscovery platform. The new release introduces two new generative AI platform features: Conversation Summaries and Contact Intents. Contact Intents is a standalone data attribute that is generated for each conversation. It identifies the customer’s “main reason” why they contacted the contact center. Note that this is in addition to the platform recording all turn-level customer intents. Conversation Summaries have been supported by TalkDiscovery for several years; this new version is a revamped approach to generating those summaries.\n\nRingCentral Launches RingSense AI APIs and Workflow Builder\n\nThe AI-driven UCaaS, CCaaS, video and hybrid event solution provider made several announcements, including new RingSense AI APIS with which customers can generate audio and video transcriptions, summarizations, and speaker diarization (attributing audio segments within a recording to individual speakers) across RingCentral and third-party generated recordings.\n\nRingCentral’s new video APIs and SDK will allow developers to integrate live video meetings and interactions into their applications through a white-labeled experience with built-in customizability, closed captioning, and chat. With the social messaging APIs, can integrate with nine different social media platforms (all the major ones). These new APIs are available in beta to RingCentral Video Pro+ and RingEX customers, free of charge.\n\nThe new RingCentral Workflow Builder allows customers to create workflows from pre-built or custom templates. The pre-built templates include automatic, canned responses for out-of-office replies, SMS keyword autoreplies, voicemail received notifications via SMS and after-hours SMS autoreplies. These new capabilities can handle more complex triggers, for example creating automated, personalized responses to an exact phone number match of an incoming SMS message or transcribing a voicemail to trigger actions based on its content.\n\nQualtrics AI to Improve CX In-Store, Online, and in the Call Center\n\nThe experience management solution provider announced its Qualtrics AI-powered Frontline Locations, Frontline Digital and Frontline Care solutions. Underlying these several CX related solutions is Qualtrics AI Assist, a platform-wide Gen AI agent that allows users to ask natural language questions about data and receive a response based on a company’s own data. Qualtrics AI Assist can generate summaries and trigger workflows.\n\nQualtrics Frontline Locations Assist is a hub that analyzes customer feedback – from surveys, within apps, the contact center, online, and reviews – to provide frontline managers with insights and recommended steps to improve customer experience.\n\nThe Qualtrics AI-powered Frontline Digital solution provides similar insights but for a Web site, such as heatmaps, funnel analytics and real-time frustration ‘interception’ which enables business to identify customers experiencing challenges with the company’s site in real time and offer targeted support in the moment.\n\nQualtrics Frontline Care includes Customer Care Assist, which aggregates insights and workflows across the customer care experience which a manager could use to generate per-agent coaching plans. It also uses Qualtrics AI to automatically summarize customer feedback which frontline teams can use to generate support tickets, send follow-up emails and/or create knowledge base articles.\n\nQualtrics Frontline Location Assist is available in private preview, as are the Digital solutions. Qualtrics Customer Care Assist is in private preview and Automated Call Summaries is generally available today.\n\nAvaamo Launches AI-Powered Agent Assist Copilot\n\nThe autonomous agent platform provider for customer service operations launched its Avaamo Agent Assist Copilot which uses generative AI throughout the call to:\n\nAgent Assist Copilot joins Avaamo’s Suite of Generative AI tools, including LLaMB, Avaamo IVA, Avaamo Outreach, and Avaamo Live Agent.\n\nSymphonyAI Launches Generative AI-based Apex Enterprise IT Copilot\n\nThe predictive and generative enterprise AI SaaS provider unveiled Apex Enterprise IT Copilot, a generative AI-based assistant for end users, IT analysts and executives. Depending on the type of end user, the copilot will provide self-serve assistance via knowledge articles, work prioritization, insights around trends, and more. The copilot is part of SymphonyAI Apex, a predictive and generative AI-based IT service management/enterprise service management platform. The copilot and Apex are powered by SymphonyAI’s Eureka Gen AI platform.\n\nCalendly Delivers New Web Browser Extension for Meeting Workflows\n\nThe centralized scheduling automation platform announced a new Calendly web browser extension for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, and a similar add-in for Outlook. Via a new meetings tab (pictured below), users can see all meetings in one place, view contact details and meeting history, schedule meetings on behalf of a team member, and book meetings from the extension without task- or app-switching. The extension is available here.\n\nThis Week on No Jitter\n\nIn case you missed them, here are some of our top stories:\n\nReserve Your Spot: Enterprise Connect AI 2024",
      "# [Vizient and Qualtrics Announce Strategic Partnership to Develop Predictive Experience Metrics to Revolutionize Healthcare Performance](https://www.vizientinc.com/newsroom/news-releases/2024/vizient-and-qualtrics-announce-strategic-partnership-to-develop-predictive-experience-metrics)\nQualtrics and Vizient combine quality and patient experience data from leading hospitals, showing a tie between patient experience and clinical outcomes\n\nInnovative partnership will empower healthcare organizations with holistic, actionable insights that will transform the way healthcare organizations measure and improve performance by using groundbreaking research-backed predictive experience models\n\nIRVING, Texas and PROVO, Utah, Sept. 17, 2024 — Vizient, Inc. the nation's largest healthcare performance improvement company, and Qualtrics, the leader and creator of the experience management category, today announced an innovative strategic partnership to employ experience metrics to transform the way healthcare organizations measure and improve performance. The partnership will help organizations more deeply understand relationships between quality, safety, and patient experiences.\n\nThis collaboration will move beyond traditional siloed measurement, combining key metrics and benchmarks Vizient and Qualtrics measure in order to drive meaningful improvements in patient outcomes and operational efficiency.\n\nUniversity of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann Health System, and Stanford Health Care—leaders in both clinical care and patient experience— participated in a pilot analysis for this groundbreaking initiative. The results of an initial analysis, presented this week at the Vizient Connections Summit, linked patient experience metrics such as clearer medical provider communication to important clinical outcomes, like emergency room visits, complications, and readmissions.\n\n\"Quality and patient experience are interrelated, but data is not easy to analyze at the patient level. By bringing quality, safety, and experience data together, we believe we can unlock the most impactful drivers of healthcare performance across multiple domains and the relationships between them,\" said David Levine, MD, FACEP, Chief Medical Officer for Vizient. \"This level of depth in insights has not been achieved in healthcare to date given siloed datasets and limited analytics.\"\n\n\"The initial analysis confirms so much of what we all believe: that the perception of experience is significantly related to clinical outcomes,\" said Dr. Adrienne Boissy, Chief Medical Officer, Qualtrics. \"But the thoughtful rigor of this work and the near term potential to focus improvement efforts of hardworking teams, prioritize interventions, and demonstrate value in dollars and operational gains is even more compelling.\"\n\nA New Era of Healthcare Performance Measurement\n\nHistorically, healthcare organizations have relied on siloed, retrospective data to measure performance and patient satisfaction. This new partnership between Vizient and Qualtrics will introduce a dynamic, forward-looking approach, allowing healthcare organizations to proactively manage performance and address clinical challenges before they manifest in performance data and drive continuous improvement with dynamic, actionable metrics that evolve with changing patient expectations and clinical environments.\n\nIdeal outcomes of the collaboration include:\n\nAnticipate Patient Outcomes: Harness patient feedback to predict clinical and operational outcomes, such as readmission rates, length of stay, and adverse clinical outcomes.;\n\nClose the Gap Between Experience and Performance: Identify correlations between patient and clinical outcomes, providing healthcare leaders with the insights needed to address care gaps before they impact performance.\n\nDevelop Modern Experience Measurement: Define key elements of modern patient experience measurement that reflect real time performance, patient reported outcomes, and align to patient centered principles.\n\nFoundational Analyses with Leading Health Systems\n\nAn initial analysis of clinical and patient experience data from mutual clients University of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann Health System, and Stanford Health Care demonstrates the power of patient experience to drive better healthcare outcomes.\n\nKey findings included:\n\nPatients having a positive perception of communication with their caregivers was significantly associated with reductions in length of stay, 30-day readmissions, and emergency room visits.\n\nAmong inpatients with limited healthcare access, those who did not feel that their preferences were considered in their discharge plan were more likely to visit the emergency department within 30 days.\n\nBetter provider explanations could help mitigate the impact of adverse clinical events. Patients who rated provider explanations negatively exhibited significantly worse overall patient satisfaction when complications occurred, an effect that reversed when patients positively rated provider explanations.\n\nParticipating hospital leaders praised the collaboration and the insights delivered in the pilot.\n\n\"The combined analytics power of Qualtrics and Vizient allows us to break down data silos and gain actionable insights that directly enhance patient care,\" said Dan Lundergan, CEO at University of Utah Health Hospitals and Clinics. \"By understanding the connections between quality measures and patient experiences, we are better equipped to deliver high-value, patient-centered healthcare.\"\n\n\"This collaboration is a transformative step forward for health care. The ability to integrate and analyze diverse data sets in meaningful ways will power even more focused improvement efforts, ultimately fulfilling our commitment to creating more value for patients and populations,\" said Memorial Hermann Health System COO, Erin Asprec.\n\n\"We're excited to participate in this innovative collaboration with Qualtrics and Vizient,\" said David Entwistle, President and CEO of Stanford Health Care. \"By leveraging comprehensive data analysis, we can redefine patient experience and operational excellence, ensuring that every decision we make is closely aligned with our patients' needs and preferences.\"\n\nNext Steps and Industry-Wide Application\n\nOpportunities for other health systems to participate are expected to be rolled out following the completion of this initial phase with University of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann, and Stanford Health Care. The partnership will empower healthcare systems to take an innovative, data-driven approach to improving patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, positioning them for long-term success in an increasingly value-based care environment.\n\nAbout Vizient, Inc.\n\nVizient, Inc., the nation's largest provider-driven healthcare performance improvement company, serves more than 65% of the nation's acute care providers, including 97% of the nation's academic medical centers, and more than 35% of the non-acute market.
