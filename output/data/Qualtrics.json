      "# Post ID 11ss3vs: Qualtrics alternatives? with +12 score by [(hello_kitteh, Reddit, 2023-03-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/)\nAny recommendations for Qualtrics alternatives?\n\nAs many of you may know, Qualtrics has recently gotten rid of their Research/Academia license and is moving everyone over to the CoreXM license. This license is built for business and has lots of analytics bells and whistles that are useless for research, and it also costs over double the annual subscription cost.\n\nMy SLAC is having a hard time justifying this price hike, so we're looking at alternative platforms.  We need something on par with Qualtrics in terms of question and output types, and the ability to have custom branding would be ideal (i.e. I don't want participants to be redirected to a random SurveyMonkey page after completing the survey).\n\nFor comparison, a site-wide license (unlimited responses) for my college with ~1200 students used to be $7500/year. Now it is limited to 1000 users and 25,000 responses for $15,000/year. We have been able to negotiate both of these prices down a little, but we're still looking at a $5k increase for more-restricted usage.\n\n## Comment ID jfqm2cy with +2 score by [(cequims, Reddit, 2023-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/jfqm2cy/) (in reply to ID 11ss3vs):\nJust got off the phone with our Qualtrics rep, and it's clear they have no interest in serving small businesses.

So far, I'm pretty happy with SurveySparrow. The features are sufficiently complex for just about everything our company needs to do across our many projects. The question options aren't as customizable as Qualtrics, and the automated reports could use a few improvements, but for the drastically lower cost I am happy to make adjustments to work with the available options. I will say that customer service is a bit spotty. They are often (but not always) available right away via their chat feature. I think most of their team is located in India, however, and sometimes time zone differences are an issue. My colleague on Pacific time tends says they often don't get back to her til the next day. I'm on East Coast time, and it's less of an issue. I also sometimes worry that because they are a smaller company, they may be less stable and more likely to have tech issues. For example, I once found that I couldn't edit data on the back end, then the next day it worked. And right now, there's a weird formatting issue where text is overlapping in the footer of the surveys. So there are definitely small signs that they are more scrappy than the big leagues. But our team of about 16 employees has been using it for about 10 months now, and it hasn't held us back.\n\n## Comment ID kzw0jm1 with +1 score by [(Spiritual-Dance-562, Reddit, 2024-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/kzw0jm1/) (in reply to ID 11ss3vs):\nQualtrics is clearly trying to eliminate small businesses.

And the most popular/exciting seminars are often booked full. \nThey always end the conference with a big concert which is cool. \nIt’s fun and I think has been most inspirational from a high level POV but if you’re looking to get into nitty gritty topics I’d say it’s not the place for that.\n\n### Comment ID ky02wqt with +2 score by [(PennyPatch2000, Reddit, 2024-04-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/19dyvyv/qualtrics_x4_conference/ky02wqt/) (in reply to ID kj9q612):\nOk, I’m in good company here as someone who has been to the X4 summit 6 times, admittedly mostly for the chance to see the big name speakers and private entertainment.

Very rarely do I find some content truly divergent or compelling. Look for the agenda and explore who is speaking first.\n\nIf you really want to go the extra mile, chat up panel/tech/data providers and have some convos. 90% of the time, theyll even give you free data to play with and explore if it will apply value to your work. You could probably make your own white paper and present yourself. This is actually a highly desirable situation for providers.\n\nIt can be so frustrating being a provider for the industry in a sales capacity because not all reps have the know how or are just leaning into a basic sales agenda. It makes it harder for those that have been around the block and know what's out there.\n\nHowever, its worthwhile to consider that those that are well positioned  see a good chunk of whats happening (SMB to Enterprise) and we see a good portion of their \"special projects\", the best example use cases with experience, the pros and cons of the competitive offerings in the marketplace, and we have a lot of value to share that can help you. It's up to you to figure out who you want to play ball with and collaborate.\n\nFollow the trends, find out who is boasting what, think if if has value to your day to day, have those convos, and explore with no commitments.\n\nMy best advice.",

I probably wouldn't do it this way.  \n\nInstead, I'd probably just build a survey-style module for data collection into the go/no-go program itself, then there is only one thing to run.\n\n## Comment ID k2ng83w with +2 score by [(Daannii, Reddit, 2023-09-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/16um4yo/is_there_a_way_to_put_an_experimental_measure_in/k2ng83w/) (in reply to ID 16um4yo):\nCheck out this website.

It's easier on the eyes. However, REDCap is ideal for research projects across the board (e.g. clinical trials to social behavioral/psychology, or even a basic survey for any need), and allows for longitudinal tracking of participants or cohorts, which Qualtrics lacks. That is why some major research institutions use REDCap over Qualtrics (though I've worked on projects that used both).

The free version of Qualtrics does not allow for data downloads making it useless for research.\n\nWe rely on REDCap as a database and scheduled measures tool, I am not sure about Qualtrics' abilities here. Our institution has also cleared REDCap to add results directly to patients charts which for our purposes makes a huge difference.

Remember, Qualtrics has servers and certifications and data security stuff. You might ask your wife who picks the service, then reconsider your target. That is, if it is chosen at the university level, chances are the university is going to go with a big enterprise solution, not a little start-up. If it is the department-level, same thing, but you might have more of an in if you have a great product. If it's at the lab level, then you could potentially make inroads, but then what about scalability? Would it be actually worth it? \n\n>automatic pairing of the data from a dyad, anonymization of the data, easy way to export clean data to SPSS or SAS, etc\n\nYou can already do this with Qualtrics.  \nHow skilled a Qualtrics user is your wife? I'm not trying to throw shade, I'm just saying that if you are judging Qualtrics' functionality based off the use-patterns of a novice or even intermediate user, maybe you're not getting the full picture of what Qualtrics can do. It's a very versatile system and an advanced user can get a huge amount of functionality out of it.  \n\nBut yeah, you can do those things already. Pairing data between dyads would take some thought, but you can definitely do that. Anonymization is built into Qualtrics; it's a check-box you can check off so we're not talking custom javascript or anything complex. Exporting data is basic functionality and is already clean so I'm not sure what you mean.\n\n### Comment ID hl4t49x with +3 score by [(_Jii_, Reddit, 2021-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/qw6pe4/room_for_an_alternative_to_qualtrics/hl4t49x/) (in reply to ID hl2gwk7):\nThank you for your input! Safety is definitely a matter that should not be skimped on and I believe it is manageable. Same goes for scalability.My wife is well recognized in her field of study and has good funding. She pays for her own license (something her department could not afford). Nevertheless, I consider her to be a novice with Qualtrics. And I think she will remain so. Most of her time is dedicated to research, not learning a new platform.\n\nAs for “clean data” I had in mind the output of matrix questions not being properly encoded when exported. It happened several times with Qualtrics. Maybe a novice mistake. But definitely something she’s annoyed by and that other users might be experiencing too. I also had in mind the fact that she has to through all the answers one by one to identify the ones answered too quickly, randomly or where the answer is always “yes”. I’m not saying Qualtrics is unable to do that (it probably does). But I think a good software should point those out more clearly, in a user friendly fashion.\n\n#### Comment ID hl52ord with +1 score by [(andero, Reddit, 2021-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/qw6pe4/room_for_an_alternative_to_qualtrics/hl52ord/) (in reply to ID hl4t49x):\nYeah, that sounds like novice Qualtrics problems to me. \n\nI guess the thing is, if she isn't willing to learn the platform she has, why would she (or other people like her) be willing to learn your new platform?\n\nIn other words, if a person has problems exporting clean data from Qualtrics, they're going to have problems exporting clean data *from any platform*. As a software person, you know that what you think of as clean data is data that is exported using a specified format and following that format. Qualtrics already does that. If the user is unwilling to learn the format and unwilling to set up their use of the platform with an understanding of the format, it really doesn't matter what the format *is* because the user isn't going to learn it.\n\nChances are, you could write a quick script in any language you know to reformat the data Qualtrics gives you into whatever format your wife wants. That would be a lot faster than building a whole new platform just because she's unwilling to learn the functionality of this one.  \n\n>she has to through all the answers one by one to identify the ones answered too quickly, randomly or where the answer is always “yes”.  \n>As a web developer though, going through 600 lines in a spreadsheet to spot check “sketchy” answers makes no sense. A good software should point out items answered too quickly or always with the first option, etc.\n\nAgain, this is your wife being a novice. There is already a way to do this in Qualtrics. You could also do with a script that would be trivially easy to write. There is probably a way to do this in SPSS, too; I use R to analyze so I'm not sure.\n\nBut yeah... sounds like this is a \"your wife doesn't want to learn software\" issue, not a \"software is limited\" issue. Qualtrics does everything your wife needs, but she isn't willing to learn it. The solution to that problem is not \"build a whole new platform\".\n\n## Comment ID hl13ky4 with +16 score by [(1n_pla1n_s1ght, Reddit, 2021-11-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/qw6pe4/room_for_an_alternative_to_qualtrics/hl13ky4/) (in reply to ID qw6pe4):\nHere's my take: \n\nAs a young researcher who just wanted to push a button and have all that done for me because learning it was hard, yes I would have jumped at the chance to have that.\n\nAs an older researcher who doesn't trust automated processes like this since they are often not transparent and if there's an issue in the process I can't identify it myself, no I don't want that. Especially if it is about anonymization which could go seriously wrong if the program did it incorrectly and I wasn't aware of it. \n\nThese are all steps for which there is usually no one way to do things right and the right way is dependent on the study and researcher preferences. Basic data cleaning isn't crazy hard and should be done based on researcher insight not on external algorithms. Does data cleaning suck? Yes. Are there sometimes insights to be gained when doing this which would be missed if the process was automated? Also yes. \n\nI've worked with data from Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey, Limesurvey, Sawtooth, Formdesk, Google Forms, and other private survey companies, and they all suck uniquely in their own way. Most of the suck goes away with experience programming the surveys properly to begin with. Most of the issues I've had have been when I trusted other companies to program stuff for me. So I would say no, there's no need for a platform like this and the big risk is over-reliance of younger researchers on button pushing rather than understanding processes.\n\nBut the real takeaway is this: your wife is a professor, she should be having graduate students doing this for her since they need the experience. Tell her to farm out the work next time and focus on the important stuff like getting grant money to hire more graduate students to do this work for her.\n\n### Comment ID hl4z4th with +1 score by [(_Jii_, Reddit, 2021-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/qw6pe4/room_for_an_alternative_to_qualtrics/hl4z4th/) (in reply to ID hl13ky4):\nThank you for your honest feedback.

Qualtrics is also well-established and has good support, so I think it’d be a hard sell.\n\n\r  \nThere’s a possible parallel with statistics software. Historically, SPSS has been widely used in psychology departments, but some are ditching it in favour of free alternatives like Jamovi or R. I’d say that Jamovi hits a sweet spot in terms of how user friendly it is, but part of that is that it does a relatively small number of things. SPSS is bloated with things that 99.9% of psychology undergraduates will never use. But if you need those features, and/or if you know where to find the things you need, then it's not really an issue and it's hard to justify the time required to learn something else.\n\n\r  \nThere is a learning curve to Qualtrics, but that’s probably unavoidable with something that has as much functionality as it does. People are going to complain about it if they can’t do the things they want to do immediately – we’re all busy people and faffing around with software doesn’t count for much – but having less features isn’t a great selling point to experienced users.\n\n### Comment ID hl5cjw5 with +2 score by [(_Jii_, Reddit, 2021-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/qw6pe4/room_for_an_alternative_to_qualtrics/hl5cjw5/) (in reply to ID hl3p8ne):\n>so the only way to compete in that space is to either be more user-friendly and/or cheaper.\n\nTotally agree.\n\nAnd I would add taking into account the fact that the new platform, if it ever exists, is dedicated to **academic research**.

Both are powerful, widely used, and have strong communities and resources to help beginners.\n\n* **R**: Particularly strong in statistical analysis and very popular in academia. You can use RStudio, which is a user-friendly interface for R. The `readr` package can be used to easily import . CSV files, and the `lm()` function for linear regression is straightforward for beginners.\n* **Python**: Great for data manipulation and analysis with libraries like Pandas for data handling and stats models or sci-kit-learn for regression analysis. Jupyter Notebooks provides an interactive coding environment that's beginner-friendly.\n\nBoth options have extensive online tutorials and communities for support. Choose one based on your comfort with programming and the specific needs of your thesis.\n\nI feel like you should check SurveySparrow, a better alternative to Qualtrics.   \nSurveySparrow provides robust analytics tools that help you quickly interpret your data and make informed decisions. With features like real-time analytics, cross-tabulation, and trend analysis, it’s easy to dive deep into the data.

Other researchers have probably made Stroop task studies using both and could probably be accessed/downloaded for free.\n\n### Comment ID j2shszv with +2 score by [(kaikane10, Reddit, 2023-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/101fiss/looking_to_develop_a_colour_stroop_task_on/j2shszv/) (in reply to ID j2q73yp):\nI'll have a look into these and have a talk with my supervisor to see if I can change to one of these\n\n## Comment ID j2q7chw with +2 score by [(Daannii, Reddit, 2023-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/101fiss/looking_to_develop_a_colour_stroop_task_on/j2q7chw/) (in reply to ID 101fiss):\nHere\n\nhttps://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/stroop.html\n\nAlready created.

      "# Post ID 1d8lt4a: Amazon Preview - Qualtrics with +1 score by [(Ainhel, Reddit, 2024-06-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/1d8lt4a/amazon_preview_qualtrics/)\nHi, I have been on the Amazon Preview panel for some time now, but yesterday I received an email from this address [noreply@qualtrics-research.com](mailto:noreply@qualtrics-research.com) asking me to complete a survey to stay on the panel.\n\nI did a little research about what Qualtrics was and read about a deal between Amazon and the company.  \nSo - very stupidly perhaps - I took the survey. Today I received another email from the address, in which they welcomed me (subj: Welcome to Amazon Preview!).\n\nDo you think I got scammed or not?\n\n## Comment ID l77gf5w with +3 score by [(Cautious-String7076, Reddit, 2024-06-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/1d8lt4a/amazon_preview_qualtrics/l77gf5w/) (in reply to ID 1d8lt4a):\nNo, lots of companies work with Qualtrics to handle their surveys, I think you’re fine\n\n### Comment ID l78bech with +1 score by [(Ainhel, Reddit, 2024-06-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/1d8lt4a/amazon_preview_qualtrics/l78bech/) (in reply to ID l77gf5w):\nThanks for replying, I hope Amazon is one of them.   \nMy main concern is that in two years this is the first time I have received a Preview survey by this e-mail address.\n\n#### Comment ID l7xqqyl with +2 score by [(Sandro905, Reddit, 2024-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/1d8lt4a/amazon_preview_qualtrics/l7xqqyl/) (in reply to ID l78bech):\nI got the same e-mail, seemed a bit weird but I took the survey, it didn't ask for anything out of the ordinary, except for my prime video mail address, but it was the same address that I received the mail on so I didn't think much of it.\n\nI then got a confirmation email just like you (a bit strange, the original mail was in my native language, the confirmation was in english). \n\n4 days later I got the same original email, that brigs me to what seems to be the exact same survey. I'm not 100% sure this is phishing, but it's a very weird mistake on their part and the pressuring of \"take this survey or you won't be a member anymore\" seems very out of place. \n\nFor now I'll not take it again.\n\n## Comment ID lhd9iqe with +2 score by [(pancakepartyy, Reddit, 2024-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/1d8lt4a/amazon_preview_qualtrics/lhd9iqe/) (in reply to ID 1d8lt4a):\nThis is an old post but I just stumbled upon it and can help reassure you that you didn’t get scammed. Qualtrics is a well known reputable company for research surveys. In college we used them to make all of our surveys when we had to do research projects. Think of it like survey monkey but more high quality. \n\nAlso, I got the email too and filled it out as well.\n\n### Comment ID lhf706n with +1 score by [(Ainhel, Reddit, 2024-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/1d8lt4a/amazon_preview_qualtrics/lhf706n/) (in reply to ID lhd9iqe):\nThank you for informing me about your experience!\nIt should not be a scam and many others have received similar emails from Amazon in recent months.\n\n### Comment ID ljih6qw with +1 score by [(Ornella_28, Reddit, 2024-08-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/1d8lt4a/amazon_preview_qualtrics/ljih6qw/) (in reply to ID lhd9iqe):\nDid you get any confirmation email after the first survey?\n\n#### Comment ID ljiudcs with +1 score by [(pancakepartyy, Reddit, 2024-08-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/1d8lt4a/amazon_preview_qualtrics/ljiudcs/) (in reply to ID ljih6qw):\nAfter the qualtrics survey?

Qualtrics just sent my most recent survey.  I had to download an app and am having a problem completing sign up.  I can not find a contact number or email address or knowledgable customer service agent for help anywhere.  Amazon Studios refers you to their general shopping customer service and no one there even realizes this program exists.  The email to be able to log into the app from the qualtrics survey does not contain a clickable link to get started and qualtrics has zero customer service for the average person.  In order to get an email address for help I need to be able to access the app for the developers email address.  It is maddening Amazon offers this program for feedback on their services and no customer service when there is a question, problem or even change of email address for their customers who participate in activities that help improve their platform."

          "advice": "Don’t risk selling long-term competitive advantages and strategic value differentiators for short-term ROI and immediate profit margins. Qualtrics’ platform is ripe for disruption if we do not stay at the bleeding edge of emerging technology. To do this, Silver Lake, ELT, and the board need to be willing to invest heavily in the people that make this business special. Qualtrics had the rise that it did (and created generational wealth for many people, especially much of the board and the leadership team) because of the hard work of a mission-driven team. If Qualtrics is going to do this again and hit 10X or 100X value multiples and become a generational SaaS company, issues with employee engagement and retention of top talent need to be addressed immediately. Here is what I would recommend: 1. Qualtrics needs to rebuild a culture of trust and collaboration, and that has to be driven through transparency and accountability at the very top. If leaders signal that they trust employees and want them to succeed, employees will trust leadership to guide them. 2. Invest heavily in systems, processes, and people. Qualtrics has significant needs for enterprise systems that work together (for example, the CRM and HRIS are poorly integrated with the other systems that they rely on). The new promotion philosophy makes sense from a cost-saving standpoint, but Qualtrics should not be cost-saving if that means we’re losing top talent that would deliver outsized value in the future. 3. Reconnect employees with the values and the mission that made this company “bigger than itself”. Becoming a top SaaS company is not motivating to the vast majority of employees if they have only marginal incentives for achieving that goal. Qualtrics’ investors and the board either needs share a much greater portion of the equity and give employees much more lucrative LTI for the financial success of the business, OR leadership needs to develop a culture that prioritizes CSR and the collective good Qualtrics can provide the world and the communities in which we operate. The company needs to do more than simply matching employee contributions to 5fortheFight. How will Qualtrics support vulnerable and marginalized people? Promote equitable, fair, inclusive, and just policies in the community? Protect the environment? How will Qualtrics be a force for good? Demonstrating good stewardship and social governance through corporate action will make Qualtrics an employer and a brand that employees and customers can be proud of.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "“Fast-paced growth SaaS company” also means major organizational changes are constant; the change fatigue is real and can be a lot to manage at times (I have been with Q for 7 years and have been through at least as many re-orgs). Recent layoffs (October 2023) have dampened moral and eroded trust in the exec leadership team, but it seems like the culture is rebounding. The hybrid work policy is not for everyone. There is a significant lack of diversity amongst the leadership team- you will see women and underrepresented minorities in the executive team, but the core group of decision makers (the Founder &amp; Board Chairman, CEO, COO, Chief Product Officer, President, many sales leaders) are all white men from Provo, Utah. Since being taken private again, Qualtrics’ promotion philosophy has become much more conservative and there are fewer opportunities for accelerated advancement compared to what you might find at a pre-IPO startup. The private equity firm that owns Q is heavily focused on profit margins, which may risk product development when many competitors are investing heavily in R&amp;D for AI.",

Change is constant, so there are lots of opportunities for making a meaningful impact on the success of the business. The pay is competitive in most markets for most roles, and the benefits are fantastic. 401k match, equity options, STI and LTI, lunches in most offices. The performance expectations are aggressive, but the bonuses are equally aggressive- exceptional work is recognized and rewarded here. It takes a lot to be exceptional with the kind of peers we have at Qualtrics, but I would rather deliver average work at this company than be a star performer some place else. The best part is the people that work here- there is a high bar for hiring and this place is filled with talented, motivated, intelligent, and empathetic people. The frontline managers and middle managers are generally very good and they care deeply about the success of their teams and their people. The leadership team is committed and competent (most have been with the company for years).",

A lot more work in every area with no additional compensation and not promoting people (a month after being laid off I’m making significantly more at a different company, doing the same thing for way less accounts). Management’s inability to listen (starting with skip level manager and up to company management) was shocking. Lots of burn out. Many people were happy to be in the lay-off group and many were sad they weren’t. Somehow the company manages to attract amazing people, so I genuinely hope they’re able to turn things around and rebuild. Really grateful for everything I learned at Q and wish them the best!",

Everyone L7 and above (especially the C-suite) need extensive training in effective change management.

          "advice": "Don’t risk selling long-term competitive advantages and strategic value differentiators for short-term ROI and immediate profit margins. Qualtrics’ platform is ripe for disruption if we do not stay at the bleeding edge of emerging technology. To do this, Silver Lake, ELT, and the board need to be willing to invest heavily in the people that make this business special. Qualtrics had the rise that it did (and created generational wealth for many people, especially much of the board and the leadership team) because of the hard work of a mission-driven team. If Qualtrics is going to do this again and hit 10X or 100X value multiples and become a generational SaaS company, issues with employee engagement and retention of top talent need to be addressed immediately. Here is what I would recommend: 1. Qualtrics needs to rebuild a culture of trust and collaboration, and that has to be driven through transparency and accountability at the very top. If leaders signal that they trust employees and want them to succeed, employees will trust leadership to guide them. 2. Invest heavily in systems, processes, and people. Qualtrics has significant needs for enterprise systems that work together (for example, the CRM and HRIS are poorly integrated with the other systems that they rely on). The new promotion philosophy makes sense from a cost-saving standpoint, but Qualtrics should not be cost-saving if that means we’re losing top talent that would deliver outsized value in the future. 3. Reconnect employees with the values and the mission that made this company “bigger than itself”. Becoming a top SaaS company is not motivating to the vast majority of employees if they have only marginal incentives for achieving that goal. Qualtrics’ investors and the board either needs share a much greater portion of the equity and give employees much more lucrative LTI for the financial success of the business, OR leadership needs to develop a culture that prioritizes CSR and the collective good Qualtrics can provide the world and the communities in which we operate. The company needs to do more than simply matching employee contributions to 5fortheFight. How will Qualtrics support vulnerable and marginalized people? Promote equitable, fair, inclusive, and just policies in the community? Protect the environment? How will Qualtrics be a force for good? Demonstrating good stewardship and social governance through corporate action will make Qualtrics an employer and a brand that employees and customers can be proud of.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "“Fast-paced growth SaaS company” also means major organizational changes are constant; the change fatigue is real and can be a lot to manage at times (I have been with Q for 7 years and have been through at least as many re-orgs). Recent layoffs (October 2023) have dampened moral and eroded trust in the exec leadership team, but it seems like the culture is rebounding. The hybrid work policy is not for everyone. There is a significant lack of diversity amongst the leadership team- you will see women and underrepresented minorities in the executive team, but the core group of decision makers (the Founder &amp; Board Chairman, CEO, COO, Chief Product Officer, President, many sales leaders) are all white men from Provo, Utah. Since being taken private again, Qualtrics’ promotion philosophy has become much more conservative and there are fewer opportunities for accelerated advancement compared to what you might find at a pre-IPO startup. The private equity firm that owns Q is heavily focused on profit margins, which may risk product development when many competitors are investing heavily in R&amp;D for AI.",

Change is constant, so there are lots of opportunities for making a meaningful impact on the success of the business. The pay is competitive in most markets for most roles, and the benefits are fantastic. 401k match, equity options, STI and LTI, lunches in most offices. The performance expectations are aggressive, but the bonuses are equally aggressive- exceptional work is recognized and rewarded here. It takes a lot to be exceptional with the kind of peers we have at Qualtrics, but I would rather deliver average work at this company than be a star performer some place else. The best part is the people that work here- there is a high bar for hiring and this place is filled with talented, motivated, intelligent, and empathetic people. The frontline managers and middle managers are generally very good and they care deeply about the success of their teams and their people. The leadership team is committed and competent (most have been with the company for years).",

They cut their entire DEI team and the high level people at the company are primarily all white mormon men. Women and BIPOC people are grossly underrepresented. - They will not consider hiring people who do not have a 4-year college degree which is a really outdated and classist practice. - The general vibe especially in the Utah office is cult-like and oozes toxic bro culture. - Mormon culture seeps into company culture and is uncomfortable for non-LDS - The general strategy for where the product is going is a total mess and real innovation is extremely hard. It's more arguments than productivity. - Because of terrible leadership moral is at an all time low - Back in the day, I would've recommended working at Qualtrics to anyone.

Big layoffs recently, many jobs moved to lower cost locations and other countries, no leadership accountability whatsoever. Total chaos followed. RTO enforcement coming. Pay cuts (or absence of refreshers) likely coming. Everyone good is looking to leave soon. Product is also incredibly boring to work on although I don't personally mind as long as working hours stay low. Not a single person in the C-suite deserves to be there. They are driving the company away from being a survey platform (which we excel at) to being a management suggestion tool (which we're bad at and customers don't need). They set on this path when the economy was good, and many customers were shelling out for a luxury product and making decisions based on employee and customer feedback. But now that the tech economy is bad, decision making is driven only by profit, making Qualtrics' experience management insights irrelevant. For example, Qualtrics can tell Delta that customers want extra leg room on flights. But Delta doesn't care, they need the money from those 3 extra rows. It is a rare case when Qualtrics can provide an insight that 1.) is novel and 2.) is actionable in a profitable way.",

They cut their entire DEI team and the high level people at the company are primarily all white mormon men. Women and BIPOC people are grossly underrepresented. - They will not consider hiring people who do not have a 4-year college degree which is a really outdated and classist practice. - The general vibe especially in the Utah office is cult-like and oozes toxic bro culture. - Mormon culture seeps into company culture and is uncomfortable for non-LDS - The general strategy for where the product is going is a total mess and real innovation is extremely hard. It's more arguments than productivity. - Because of terrible leadership moral is at an all time low - Back in the day, I would've recommended working at Qualtrics to anyone.

Big layoffs recently, many jobs moved to lower cost locations and other countries, no leadership accountability whatsoever. Total chaos followed. RTO enforcement coming. Pay cuts (or absence of refreshers) likely coming. Everyone good is looking to leave soon. Product is also incredibly boring to work on although I don't personally mind as long as working hours stay low. Not a single person in the C-suite deserves to be there. They are driving the company away from being a survey platform (which we excel at) to being a management suggestion tool (which we're bad at and customers don't need). They set on this path when the economy was good, and many customers were shelling out for a luxury product and making decisions based on employee and customer feedback. But now that the tech economy is bad, decision making is driven only by profit, making Qualtrics' experience management insights irrelevant. For example, Qualtrics can tell Delta that customers want extra leg room on flights. But Delta doesn't care, they need the money from those 3 extra rows.

      "# [Qualtrics To Lay Off Hundreds Amid Restructuring by Wade Tyler Millward](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/qualtrics-to-lay-off-hundreds-amid-restructuring)\nPositions in sales, DEI, engineering were cut, according to LinkedIn posts.\n\nQualtrics, a web-based survey and reports tools provider, plans to lay off about 780 people across the company, with “several hundred roles” changing or moving locations over the next year.\n\nZig Serafin, CEO of the vendor – which has headquarters in Provo, Utah, and Seattle – said in a blog post that the layoffs are a result of “a deep review of every function in the company” and that the new Qualtrics “will enable our teams to work better together, bring new innovations to market faster, and make it easier for our customers and partners to do business with us.”\n\n“Rapid hiring was essential to enable our growth up to this point, but it also created complexity that does not support continued growth at our scale,” Serafin said. “Simply put, the organizational structures, work processes and the way we made decisions previously don’t work for the company we’ve become, or the company we aspire to be.”\n\n[RELATED: SAP-Backed Qualtrics Accepts $12.5B Takeover From Silver Lake, CPPIC]\n\nQualtrics Layoffs\n\nCRN has reached out to Qualtrics for comment.\n\nIn the blog post, Serafin added that “while these changes are important to Qualtrics’ future, they are not easy. And we are going to support teammates who are affected.”\n\n“To those who are leaving, I am truly sorry,” he said. “I know this explanation doesn’t make it any better for you. On behalf of the entire company, thank you for everything you’ve given to Qualtrics, and for the chapters you have helped to write. We are committed to supporting you through this change.”\n\nQualtrics has a partner program with members including EY, Accenture, IBM, Bain & Co., UST, Cognizant and other solution provider giants. As of Jan. 25, more than 400 partners were in the Qualtrics Partner Network, according to the company.\n\nThe company had more than 5,000 employees worldwide as of Jan. 25, according to Qualtrics’ website. This would mean the layoffs affect about 15 percent of the workforce.\n\nIn June, private equity firm Silver Lake and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board – or CPP Investments – completed their acquisition of Qualtrics for about $12.5 billion, which included the purchase of SAP’s majority stake in the company.\n\nSilver Lake portfolio companies include Dell Technologies, Stripe and VMware, according to its website.\n\nCPP holdings include Alphabet and Nvidia. CPP private equity investments have included Epicor, Veeam, Qlik, Mimecast, McAfee, Snowflake, Anaplan, Databricks and Informatica, according to its website.\n\nSAP had bought Qualtrics four years earlier for $8 billion and spun it out as a publicly traded company, with SAP retaining that majority stake.\n\nWord of SAP seeking to sell its stake emerged in January, when SAP announced it would lay off up to 3,000 employees – about 2.5 percent of its global workforce.\n\nIn Qualtrics’ last public report of its finances, the company reported for full year 2022 $1.5 billion in total revenue, up 36 percent year over year. Fourth quarter revenue was $389.1 million, up 23 percent year over year.\n\nOn Qualtrics’ earnings call Jan. 25, Serafin notably said that the company continued “to strengthen our strategic partnerships and work together to solve our customers’ most pressing challenges,” according to a call transcript.\n\nQualtrics Chief Financial Officer Rob Bachman elaborated on the call that said that for fiscal year 2023, Qualtrics was “streamlining our go-to-market, including leveraging our partner ecosystem for both business development and services fulfillment,” according to the transcript.\n\nThe company isn’t alone in cutting its employee roster amid growing inflation, the possibility of a recession in the near future and tightening IT budgets after high demand for technology during the height of the pandemic.\n\nBlackLine, Malwarebytes, Google, Dell Technologies and Slalom are among the tech businesses to announce or conduct layoffs in recent weeks.\n\nEmployees In Sales, DEI Cut\n\nMultiple Qualtrics employees took to social media network LinkedIn to confirm their layoffs, with cuts hitting roles in engineering, management, sales, and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).\n\nA senior sales enablement specialist with the company for almost two years said in a LinkedIn post that last week, his wife gave birth to a son who spent time in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) due to complications.\n\n“Despite being laid off, I am the luckiest man in the world,” he wrote. “After 5 days of paternity, it got cut short with the layoffs at Qualtrics, with no explanation other than reduction in spend & reorganization. Yet I’m LUCKY again to be back on the market and seek my next adventure!”\n\nOthers who posted on LinkedIn about getting laid off from Qualtrics include:\n\n*A senior sales development representative for employee experience with the company for more than a year\n\n*A level two technology specialist with the company for more than two years\n\n*A senior vendor analyst with the company for more than a year\n\n*A DEI program manager with the company for about a year\n\n*A revenue operations specialist with the company for more than three years\n\n*A principal solutions engineer for financial services with the company for more than a year\n\n*A global program manager with a Salesforce focus with the company for more than two years\n\n*A deal support specialist with the company for less than a year\n\n*An information security engineer with the company for more than a year\n\n*A product enablement consultant with the company for almost four years\n\n*A global web marketing strategy manager with the company for almost five years\n\n*An engineering project manager with the company for more than a year",

It makes it possible for an organisation to build an understanding of every customer and employee to create human connection at scale, so that your products and services and personalised experiences feel tailored to their needs and their preferences.\n\n“This helps engender deep loyalty among the many, not just the few, and that attracts new customers and employees while also driving down the costs to serve both.”",

Companies using Qualtrics saw their customer satisfaction metrics rise 7-12% year over year.\n\nNucleus analysts conducted in-depth interviews with six organizations using Qualtrics to understand their business challenges, their decision and deployment processes, the costs incurred, benefits achieved, and best practices learned from their deployments. The customers had annual revenues ranging from $10B to $90B. Based on customer data collected, Nucleus completed an ROI assessment of three customer deployments and validated that ROI audit with each customer's project team leadership.\n\n\"Qualtrics equips organizations with the capabilities they need to deliver superior experiences, fostering deep connections with customers and employees,\" said Brad Anderson, President of Product and Engineering at Qualtrics. \"Businesses are more focused than ever on delivering strong profits and this report shows the clear link between experience management and increased revenue, employee productivity and cost savings that have a major impact on a company's topline results.\"\n\nBad customer experiences lead directly to lost revenue, and just one negative interaction can result in losing a customer and their potential spending in the future. New Qualtrics research found that globally, organizations are putting $3.7 trillion annually at risk due to bad customer experiences, an increase of approximately $600 billion (19%) compared to projections from last year. Organizations use XM solutions to understand their greatest friction points, retain and engage top talent, and take the right action to deliver exceptional products and services.\n\nOrganizations that participated in the Nucleus research increased revenue, employee retention, customer satisfaction, and cut costs, by using the Qualtrics platform to reduce customer churn, uncover business opportunities, reduce compliance risk, and improve employee recognition. The report highlighted several significant benefits of using the Qualtrics platform.\n\nIncreased Revenue:\n\nOne organization identified common mistakes in its processes and lowered customer churn for clients due to better allocation of support resources, resulting in an annual revenue increase of $2.5 million.\n\nOne Qualtrics customer in healthcare was able to use insights from the platform to fix bugs on its website that were interfering with patient payments, increasing its annual net collection rate by approximately $1.3 million.\n\nQualtrics also played a key role in identifying and validating new business opportunities. Nucleus found that insights provided by Qualtrics enabled organizations to optimize post-pandemic reopening strategies, new product-line segmentations, and strategic merger and acquisition prospects.\n\nImproved Scalability:\n\nThanks to the platform's high scalability, some organizations managed to avoid extra per-survey expenses from their former providers, leading to yearly savings ranging from $90,000 to $650,000 by consolidating their experience management efforts into a single platform.\n\nOrganizations reduced average survey and XM technology costs by 37.5 percent, accomplished by consolidating several platform features and tools into Qualtrics. One customer was able to consolidate eight different systems into one instance of Qualtrics.\n\nThe Qualtrics platform allowed customers to do more with fewer employees – Nucleus found that avoided extraneous overhead across Qualtrics customers ranged from 1.25 to 100 full-time equivalents (FTEs) depending on the scale of the deployment.\n\nIncreased Productivity and Frontline Engagement\n\nQualtrics XM® for Customer Frontlines made a strong impact on frontline engagement.\n\nOne organization avoided having to manually capture and enter customer complaints by switching from a system without the necessary functionality, saving more than 800 hours annually.\n\nReporting was another area of improved CX efficiency, with one organization experiencing an 80 percent average decrease in time spent generating reports.\n\nBy using Qualtrics to learn about employee needs, including training requirements and new equipment, a large healthcare provider reduced caregiver turnover by 1.2 percent, saving it the cost and hassle of replacing 26 caregivers every year.\n\nThe same healthcare industry customer reduced the workload for risk executives by avoiding escalations, saving 32 hours per week on average\n\nOrganizations in the logistics and retail sectors improved employee performance by using Qualtrics to share direct feedback from customers.\n\n\"By employing an all-comprehensive experience management platform, organizations can streamline vendor management costs and complexities while reaping benefits from a singular data source, assuring effective delivery of outcomes at the intersection of customer and employee experience,\" states Research Manager Evelyn McMullen. \"Qualtrics' CrossXM product converges customer experience (CX) and employee experience (EX) data and processes to optimize decision-making and amplify business impact across different experiences.\"\n\nDownload the full Nucleus Research report to learn more.\n\nAbout Qualtrics\n\nQualtrics, the leader and creator of the experience management category, is a cloud-native software platform that empowers organizations to deliver exceptional experiences and build deep relationships with their customers and employees.

Earlier this year, it announced plans to lay off 2.5 percent of its global workforce.\n\nSoon after, Qualtrics was acquired by investment firms Silver Lake and CPP Investments for $12.5BN, including SAP’s remaining 71 percent stake in Qualtrics.\n\nGoing deeper into the rationale behind the job cuts in a memo to employees, Serafin explained: “Simply put, the organizational structures, work processes, and the way we made decisions previously don’t work for the company we’ve become or the company we aspire to be.\n\nThe result is an organizational structure that will enable our teams to work better together, bring new innovations to market faster, and make it easier for our customers and partners to do business with us.\n\nEmployees made redundant will receive a minimum of ten weeks of severance pay, health insurance, equity vesting, as well as outstanding quarterly bonuses.\n\nAlongside these layoffs, the company is also planning to relocate hundreds of staff to new roles and locations. The aim is to streamline its go-to-market and product development activities.\n\nQualtrics is expected to have completed this restricting effort by the end of the year.\n\nYet, the news may come as a surprise to many after Qualtrics’ promising recent financial results after SAP’s agreed sale of the company.\n\nIndeed, the company reported revenue for the quarter as $409.8 million, representing a 22 percent increase year over year. Moreover, the company reduced its net and operating losses and increased its margin and income per share.\n\nQualtrics has formed some positive new relationships with organizations, including LinkedIn, Lumen Technologies, ISS Worldwide, PayPal, Dairy Queen, Banco Compartamos, and more.\n\nIt has also expanded partnerships in recent times with Twilio, Five9, and Merkle.\n\nMoreover, Qualtrics announced the general availability of its AI insights tools, Qualtrics Automated Summaries for Video Feedback, In-Depth Interviews, and Focus Groups. The suite assists companies in improving research, increasing market share, and meeting customer needs.\n\nYet, unfortunately, all this innovation was not enough to save the jobs of almost 800 employees as Qualtrics prepares for the future.\n\nFor more from Qualtrics, check out some of its other recent news stories:",

To get here, we conducted a deep review of every function in the company.\n\n“The result is an organizational structure that will enable our teams to work better together, bring new innovations to market faster, and make it easier for our customers and partners to do business with us.”\n\nA company spokeswoman said the layoffs will affect workers at all 26 Qualtrics offices, including the company co-headquarters in Provo and Seattle, but could not offer details on how many Utah-based employees would be impacted by the decision.\n\nU.S.-based Qualtrics employees who lost their jobs Wednesday will be eligible for a minimum of 10 weeks of severance pay, depending on their job title and tenure, as well as health insurance extensions and other benefits, according to the company.\n\n“To those who are leaving, I am truly sorry,” Serafin wrote in his email to employees. “I know this explanation doesn’t make it any better for you. On behalf of the entire company, thank you for everything you’ve given to Qualtrics, and for the chapters you have helped to write.”\n\nBack in March, Silicon Valley tech investment firm Silver Lake, in partnership with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire Qualtrics in an all-cash deal worth $12.5 billion. The acquisition deal closed over the summer.\n\nSilver Lake participated in Qualtrics’ 2021 IPO and, before the sale agreement, held a stake in the company just shy of 4.2%. Silver Lake, based in Menlo Park, California, is a technology-focused investment firm that holds around $92 billion in assets and is also heavily invested in another Utah-based company, property management software developer Entrata.\n\nGerman software giant SAP acquired Qualtrics in November 2018 when it inked a mammoth deal to acquire the Utah-born customer experience innovator for $8 billion.\n\nAt the time, it stood as the highest valued acquisition ever for a venture-backed software company and, adding to the drama of the moment, the deal was announced just days before Qualtrics was scheduled to launch its own IPO.\n\nBack in 2018, some market watchers criticized SAP for overpaying, noting Qualtrics’ pre-IPO valuation estimates were coming in at the $4.5 billion to $5 billion range.\n\nBut just two years later, that naysaying was rendered moot when SAP spun Qualtrics off in an IPO that raised $1.5 billion in fresh capital on a valuation north of $15 billion.\n\nQualtrics’ IPO redux in 2021 came just weeks after Smith was announced as the new majority owner of the Utah Jazz after closing a deal rumored to be worth $1.6 billion.\n\nSmith kept a stake in Qualtrics following the IPO, and is reportedly the biggest individual shareholder while SAP retained a majority interest in the company.\n\nQualtrics was founded in 2002 by Ryan and Jared Smith based on technology first developed by Ryan and his father, BYU researcher and professor Scott Smith, amid the elder Smith’s successful fight against throat cancer.\n\nInitially conceived of as a survey tool for academics, Qualtrics morphed into a set of tools and deep data analysis processes optimized for assessing clients’ business vitality, as viewed through the eyes of their clients and/or employees. This new set of analytics and insight theory has grown to become its own business category, and Qualtrics is both the progenitor and leader of the customer experience realm.\n\nQualtrics has some 20,000 clients in over 100 countries and reported nearly $1.5 billion in total revenue in 2022.",

      "# [Duke renews contract with Qualtrics by Office of Information Technology on 2024-07-15](https://oit.duke.edu/news/duke-renews-contract-qualtrics/)\nThe university has reached an agreement on pricing, and there is no longer a risk of disruption with the Duke University/DKU-wide Qualtrics license at the end of the 2024 year. The new license covers the current volume of Qualtrics survey responses for another 5 years, through Dec 31, 2029.\n\nWho is covered under the new contract?\n\nThe contract that has been under negotiation includes users of the existing University and DKU service, as well as two other services used by the Health System:\n\nAcademic CoreXM (University/DKU)\n\nPatient Experience (Duke Health)\n\nDiscover for Contact Centers DHAS & DPC Triage (Duke Health)\n\nHow much will the new contract cost Duke?\n\nThe 2025 annual cost will be roughly 70 percent more than what the University paid in 2024 and 2.5x the license cost from 2023. However, it is a significant improvement over the initial proposed increase from the vendor which would have amounted to a 6x increase over the life of the contract, relative to 2023. The price now increases by ~3x relative to what the University paid in 2023.\n\nAn additional benefit is that the University now has a five-year contract over which to spread the increase.\n\nThe contract period also gives us more time gaining experience with current survey tools and upcoming tools on the market. We will also need to evaluate whether alternative funding options might be advisable in the future (e.g., for research projects, funding via grants may become an option).\n\nShould Duke researchers using Academic CoreXM still consider other survey tool options?\n\nIt is still important to consider other software for surveys with uncomplicated designs and where tracking longitudinal data is less essential. Duke will soon develop a request process to reduce the number of Qualtrics survey responses and, if necessary, direct them to a more appropriate survey tool. See a list of other survey tools available at Duke here: https://oit.duke.edu/service/survey-tools.\n\nUpdates on the new Qualtrics process will be shared broadly and posted on the OIT website: https://oit.duke.edu/service/qualtrics.\n\nHow do I know which tool is right for me?\n\nThe Office of Information Technology has developed a comparison chart to help Duke community members decide among various survey and forms tools - https://oit.duke.edu/help/articles/kb0037717.",
