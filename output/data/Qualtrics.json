Qualtrics leverages a vast database of human sentiment data to inform its solutions, which are designed to improve digital experiences, customer engagement, and business growth through actionable insights [(Qualtrics, 2024)](https://www.qualtrics.com/news/).\n\nFounded in 2002, Qualtrics has grown significantly over the years. In March 2023, it was acquired by Silver Lake and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for $12.5 billion, transitioning from its previous ownership under SAP, which held a 71% stake [(Fisher, CX Today, 2024)](https://www.cxtoday.com/voice-of-the-customer/court-approves-12-5bn-sap-qualtrics-sale-dismisses-stockholders-conflict-claims/). This acquisition has enabled Qualtrics to focus on innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence, with plans to invest $500 million in AI advancements over the coming years [(Blakeley & Kay-McClean, Research Live, 2024)](https://www.research-live.com/article/news/qualtrics-expands-ai-and-market-research-tools/id/5125463).\n\nQualtrics' product offerings include tools for digital experience management, customer experience, employee experience, brand tracking, and market research.

Customer satisfaction metrics also improved by 7-12% year-over-year [(PR Newswire, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/report-cost-savings-and-added-revenue-pay-off-initial-qualtrics-investment-in-1-5-years-302068577.html).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nQualtrics continues to strengthen its position as a leader in experience management through strategic partnerships, innovative AI developments, and a commitment to enhancing customer and employee experiences.

      "# Post ID 11ss3vs: Qualtrics alternatives? with +12 score by [(hello_kitteh, Reddit, 2023-03-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/)\nAny recommendations for Qualtrics alternatives?\n\nAs many of you may know, Qualtrics has recently gotten rid of their Research/Academia license and is moving everyone over to the CoreXM license. This license is built for business and has lots of analytics bells and whistles that are useless for research, and it also costs over double the annual subscription cost.\n\nMy SLAC is having a hard time justifying this price hike, so we're looking at alternative platforms.  We need something on par with Qualtrics in terms of question and output types, and the ability to have custom branding would be ideal (i.e. I don't want participants to be redirected to a random SurveyMonkey page after completing the survey).\n\nFor comparison, a site-wide license (unlimited responses) for my college with ~1200 students used to be $7500/year. Now it is limited to 1000 users and 25,000 responses for $15,000/year. We have been able to negotiate both of these prices down a little, but we're still looking at a $5k increase for more-restricted usage.\n\n## Comment ID jfqm2cy with +2 score by [(cequims, Reddit, 2023-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/jfqm2cy/) (in reply to ID 11ss3vs):\nJust got off the phone with our Qualtrics rep, and it's clear they have no interest in serving small businesses. They want to more or less double our license cost. I last did my research on different survey platforms about a year ago, and at that time I liked [Survey Sparrow](https://www.surveysparrow.com), so check them out.\n\n### Comment ID ke5j3n0 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/ke5j3n0/) (in reply to ID jfqm2cy):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID kxp1oz9 with +1 score by [(cequims, Reddit, 2024-04-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/kxp1oz9/) (in reply to ID ke5j3n0):\nSorry for the slow reply - I don't get on Reddit much. So far, I'm pretty happy with SurveySparrow. The features are sufficiently complex for just about everything our company needs to do across our many projects. The question options aren't as customizable as Qualtrics, and the automated reports could use a few improvements, but for the drastically lower cost I am happy to make adjustments to work with the available options. I will say that customer service is a bit spotty. They are often (but not always) available right away via their chat feature. I think most of their team is located in India, however, and sometimes time zone differences are an issue. My colleague on Pacific time tends says they often don't get back to her til the next day. I'm on East Coast time, and it's less of an issue. I also sometimes worry that because they are a smaller company, they may be less stable and more likely to have tech issues. For example, I once found that I couldn't edit data on the back end, then the next day it worked. And right now, there's a weird formatting issue where text is overlapping in the footer of the surveys. So there are definitely small signs that they are more scrappy than the big leagues. But our team of about 16 employees has been using it for about 10 months now, and it hasn't held us back.\n\n## Comment ID kzw0jm1 with +1 score by [(Spiritual-Dance-562, Reddit, 2024-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/kzw0jm1/) (in reply to ID 11ss3vs):\nQualtrics is clearly trying to eliminate small businesses.

Plus, as opposed to Qualtrics, Survicate is a small company that understands and values all of its customers, so surely you'd be able to get a good deal. One thing they also offer that's great for research is AI analysis - really speeds up analyzing open-ended responses.\n\n## Comment ID l9bmfin with +1 score by [(Mohawk200x, Reddit, 2024-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/l9bmfin/) (in reply to ID 11ss3vs):\nBest one yet is [SmartSurvey](https://www.smartsurvey.com), easy to use and no nonesense.

All of these errors happen on Google Chrome. I am either getting \"400 Error\" or \"Error\" after trying to proceed after the consent form.\n\n I changed browsers, and had a smooth experience. Is anyone else experiencing errors from Qualtrics? Are you using Google Chrome? If you are, then change browsers. I tested Opera and Firefox, and the surveys did not have errors. \n\n## Comment ID efx7vi9 with +7 score by [(clickhappier, Reddit, 2019-02-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/comments/anxlsj/errors_with_qualtrics_may_be_chrome_related/efx7vi9/) (in reply to ID anxlsj):\nOnce you've done enough surveys in the other browsers, you'll get the same error there too sooner or later.

      "# Post ID 11ss012: Qualtrics alternatives? with +28 score by [(hello_kitteh, Reddit, 2023-03-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/11ss012/qualtrics_alternatives/)\nAny recommendations for Qualtrics alternatives?\n\nAs many of you may know, Qualtrics has recently gotten rid of their Research/Academia license and is moving everyone over to the CoreXM license. This license is built for business and has lots of analytics bells and whistles that are useless for research, and it also costs over double the annual subscription cost.\n\nMy SLAC is having a hard time justifying this price hike, so we're looking at alternative platforms.  We need something on par with Qualtrics in terms of question and output types, and the ability to have custom branding would be ideal (i.e. I don't want participants to be redirected to a random SurveyMonkey page after completing the survey).\n\nFor comparison, a site-wide license (unlimited responses) for my college with ~1200 students used to be $7500/year. Now it is limited to 1000 users and 25,000 responses for $15,000/year. We have been able to negotiate both of these prices down a little, but we're still looking at a $5k increase for more-restricted usage.\n\n## Comment ID jcinizm with +7 score by [(cattyditty, Reddit, 2023-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/11ss012/qualtrics_alternatives/jcinizm/) (in reply to ID 11ss012):\nREDCap!

On review sites, they get high marks for being “well-rounded,” but when you dive into market researchers’ opinions, it’s a different story. The pricing complaints are real—it’s not transparent, and you end up paying way more than expected. Plus, customer service issues? Definitely frustrating when you’re dealing with tight deadlines and complex surveys.\n\nI think part of the problem is that Qualtrics has grown so much, and with that comes the loss of personalized support and that sharp focus on survey quality. It’s like they’re trying to be *everything* for *everyone*, and that just doesn’t work when you need reliability and flexibility in your research.\n\nIn my experience, if you’re looking for a solid alternative, SurveySparrow hits a sweet spot. It’s way more intuitive, so you don’t need a specialist breathing down your neck for every little thing. Plus, it’s self-serve, which is what a lot of people here seem to be looking for. You can easily run and manage your surveys without those constant check-ins from a project manager. And with automated workflows, real-time insights, and sentiment analysis baked in, it feels much lighter without sacrificing the important features.\n\nBut yeah, it seems like Qualtrics sticks around because switching can feel like a hassle, and it’s what a lot of agencies are already comfortable with.

The platform itself is solid when you’re handling your own panels and need a lot of customization, but when it comes to using their panels or relying on their project managers, it seems to fall apart. The long launch times and errors caused by their team must’ve been super frustrating. High turnover definitely doesn’t help either no one wants to feel like they know the tool better than the people managing their projects!\n\nSwitching to another solution sounds like the right call. What platform did you end up going with, and how has that experience been so far?\n\n#### Comment ID lr9l3mv with +1 score by [(jemedebrouille, Reddit, 2024-10-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lr9l3mv/) (in reply to ID lr8j9rd):\nWe switched to Prodege and it's still new for us but it's been super positive.

The number of surveys I've done that lack page breaks is astounding. Seeing more than about 10 questions on a single page is overwhelming for most people and increases your chances of accidentally skipped questions.\n\nFor question matrices with Likert scale items, ensure that the labels for the response options appear at the top and the middle of the matrix (not just the top). You can change this in question settings. This will help to ensure that respondents don't have to keep scrolling to the top of the page to see the the response options. People will forget what the response options are, especially if you have a larger number of response options. \n\nSet the questions to \"request response\". This will flag skipped questions for participants so they are asked if they want to continue the survey without answering a skipped question. This doesn't work for matrices though.\n\nUse multie blocks as you're setting up your survey. For example, if you have demographics questions, mental health questions, and substance use questions, put all of your demographics questions in one block, your mental health questions in second block, and your substance use questions in a third block.  This is for YOUR sake. It's easier to find/edit/move questions when you have multipe blocks rather than what could be 100+ questions placed into a single block.

Today I received another email from the address, in which they welcomed me (subj: Welcome to Amazon Preview!).\n\nDo you think I got scammed or not?\n\n## Comment ID l77gf5w with +3 score by [(Cautious-String7076, Reddit, 2024-06-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/1d8lt4a/amazon_preview_qualtrics/l77gf5w/) (in reply to ID 1d8lt4a):\nNo, lots of companies work with Qualtrics to handle their surveys, I think you’re fine\n\n### Comment ID l78bech with +1 score by [(Ainhel, Reddit, 2024-06-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/1d8lt4a/amazon_preview_qualtrics/l78bech/) (in reply to ID l77gf5w):\nThanks for replying, I hope Amazon is one of them.   \nMy main concern is that in two years this is the first time I have received a Preview survey by this e-mail address.\n\n#### Comment ID l7xqqyl with +2 score by [(Sandro905, Reddit, 2024-06-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/1d8lt4a/amazon_preview_qualtrics/l7xqqyl/) (in reply to ID l78bech):\nI got the same e-mail, seemed a bit weird but I took the survey, it didn't ask for anything out of the ordinary, except for my prime video mail address, but it was the same address that I received the mail on so I didn't think much of it.\n\nI then got a confirmation email just like you (a bit strange, the original mail was in my native language, the confirmation was in english). \n\n4 days later I got the same original email, that brigs me to what seems to be the exact same survey. I'm not 100% sure this is phishing, but it's a very weird mistake on their part and the pressuring of \"take this survey or you won't be a member anymore\" seems very out of place. \n\nFor now I'll not take it again.\n\n## Comment ID lhd9iqe with +2 score by [(pancakepartyy, Reddit, 2024-08-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonPrimeVideo/comments/1d8lt4a/amazon_preview_qualtrics/lhd9iqe/) (in reply to ID 1d8lt4a):\nThis is an old post but I just stumbled upon it and can help reassure you that you didn’t get scammed. Qualtrics is a well known reputable company for research surveys. In college we used them to make all of our surveys when we had to do research projects.

Qualtrics just sent my most recent survey.  I had to download an app and am having a problem completing sign up.  I can not find a contact number or email address or knowledgable customer service agent for help anywhere.  Amazon Studios refers you to their general shopping customer service and no one there even realizes this program exists.  The email to be able to log into the app from the qualtrics survey does not contain a clickable link to get started and qualtrics has zero customer service for the average person.  In order to get an email address for help I need to be able to access the app for the developers email address.  It is maddening Amazon offers this program for feedback on their services and no customer service when there is a question, problem or even change of email address for their customers who participate in activities that help improve their platform."

          "advice": "Don’t risk selling long-term competitive advantages and strategic value differentiators for short-term ROI and immediate profit margins. Qualtrics’ platform is ripe for disruption if we do not stay at the bleeding edge of emerging technology. To do this, Silver Lake, ELT, and the board need to be willing to invest heavily in the people that make this business special. Qualtrics had the rise that it did (and created generational wealth for many people, especially much of the board and the leadership team) because of the hard work of a mission-driven team. If Qualtrics is going to do this again and hit 10X or 100X value multiples and become a generational SaaS company, issues with employee engagement and retention of top talent need to be addressed immediately. Here is what I would recommend: 1. Qualtrics needs to rebuild a culture of trust and collaboration, and that has to be driven through transparency and accountability at the very top. If leaders signal that they trust employees and want them to succeed, employees will trust leadership to guide them. 2. Invest heavily in systems, processes, and people. Qualtrics has significant needs for enterprise systems that work together (for example, the CRM and HRIS are poorly integrated with the other systems that they rely on). The new promotion philosophy makes sense from a cost-saving standpoint, but Qualtrics should not be cost-saving if that means we’re losing top talent that would deliver outsized value in the future. 3. Reconnect employees with the values and the mission that made this company “bigger than itself”. Becoming a top SaaS company is not motivating to the vast majority of employees if they have only marginal incentives for achieving that goal. Qualtrics’ investors and the board either needs share a much greater portion of the equity and give employees much more lucrative LTI for the financial success of the business, OR leadership needs to develop a culture that prioritizes CSR and the collective good Qualtrics can provide the world and the communities in which we operate. The company needs to do more than simply matching employee contributions to 5fortheFight. How will Qualtrics support vulnerable and marginalized people? Promote equitable, fair, inclusive, and just policies in the community? Protect the environment? How will Qualtrics be a force for good? Demonstrating good stewardship and social governance through corporate action will make Qualtrics an employer and a brand that employees and customers can be proud of.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "“Fast-paced growth SaaS company” also means major organizational changes are constant; the change fatigue is real and can be a lot to manage at times (I have been with Q for 7 years and have been through at least as many re-orgs). Recent layoffs (October 2023) have dampened moral and eroded trust in the exec leadership team, but it seems like the culture is rebounding. The hybrid work policy is not for everyone. There is a significant lack of diversity amongst the leadership team- you will see women and underrepresented minorities in the executive team, but the core group of decision makers (the Founder &amp; Board Chairman, CEO, COO, Chief Product Officer, President, many sales leaders) are all white men from Provo, Utah. Since being taken private again, Qualtrics’ promotion philosophy has become much more conservative and there are fewer opportunities for accelerated advancement compared to what you might find at a pre-IPO startup. The private equity firm that owns Q is heavily focused on profit margins, which may risk product development when many competitors are investing heavily in R&amp;D for AI.",

Change is constant, so there are lots of opportunities for making a meaningful impact on the success of the business. The pay is competitive in most markets for most roles, and the benefits are fantastic. 401k match, equity options, STI and LTI, lunches in most offices. The performance expectations are aggressive, but the bonuses are equally aggressive- exceptional work is recognized and rewarded here. It takes a lot to be exceptional with the kind of peers we have at Qualtrics, but I would rather deliver average work at this company than be a star performer some place else. The best part is the people that work here- there is a high bar for hiring and this place is filled with talented, motivated, intelligent, and empathetic people. The frontline managers and middle managers are generally very good and they care deeply about the success of their teams and their people. The leadership team is committed and competent (most have been with the company for years).",

They cut their entire DEI team and the high level people at the company are primarily all white mormon men. Women and BIPOC people are grossly underrepresented. - They will not consider hiring people who do not have a 4-year college degree which is a really outdated and classist practice. - The general vibe especially in the Utah office is cult-like and oozes toxic bro culture. - Mormon culture seeps into company culture and is uncomfortable for non-LDS - The general strategy for where the product is going is a total mess and real innovation is extremely hard. It's more arguments than productivity. - Because of terrible leadership moral is at an all time low - Back in the day, I would've recommended working at Qualtrics to anyone.

Pay cuts (or absence of refreshers) likely coming. Everyone good is looking to leave soon. Product is also incredibly boring to work on although I don't personally mind as long as working hours stay low. Not a single person in the C-suite deserves to be there. They are driving the company away from being a survey platform (which we excel at) to being a management suggestion tool (which we're bad at and customers don't need). They set on this path when the economy was good, and many customers were shelling out for a luxury product and making decisions based on employee and customer feedback. But now that the tech economy is bad, decision making is driven only by profit, making Qualtrics' experience management insights irrelevant. For example, Qualtrics can tell Delta that customers want extra leg room on flights. But Delta doesn't care, they need the money from those 3 extra rows. It is a rare case when Qualtrics can provide an insight that 1.) is novel and 2.) is actionable in a profitable way.",

Pay cuts (or absence of refreshers) likely coming. Everyone good is looking to leave soon. Product is also incredibly boring to work on although I don't personally mind as long as working hours stay low. Not a single person in the C-suite deserves to be there. They are driving the company away from being a survey platform (which we excel at) to being a management suggestion tool (which we're bad at and customers don't need). They set on this path when the economy was good, and many customers were shelling out for a luxury product and making decisions based on employee and customer feedback. But now that the tech economy is bad, decision making is driven only by profit, making Qualtrics' experience management insights irrelevant. For example, Qualtrics can tell Delta that customers want extra leg room on flights. But Delta doesn't care, they need the money from those 3 extra rows. It is a rare case when Qualtrics can provide an insight that 1.) is novel and 2.) is actionable in a profitable way.",

        "advice": "Don’t risk selling long-term competitive advantages and strategic value differentiators for short-term ROI and immediate profit margins. Qualtrics’ platform is ripe for disruption if we do not stay at the bleeding edge of emerging technology. To do this, Silver Lake, ELT, and the board need to be willing to invest heavily in the people that make this business special. Qualtrics had the rise that it did (and created generational wealth for many people, especially much of the board and the leadership team) because of the hard work of a mission-driven team. If Qualtrics is going to do this again and hit 10X or 100X value multiples and become a generational SaaS company, issues with employee engagement and retention of top talent need to be addressed immediately. Here is what I would recommend: 1. Qualtrics needs to rebuild a culture of trust and collaboration, and that has to be driven through transparency and accountability at the very top. If leaders signal that they trust employees and want them to succeed, employees will trust leadership to guide them. 2. Invest heavily in systems, processes, and people. Qualtrics has significant needs for enterprise systems that work together (for example, the CRM and HRIS are poorly integrated with the other systems that they rely on). The new promotion philosophy makes sense from a cost-saving standpoint, but Qualtrics should not be cost-saving if that means we’re losing top talent that would deliver outsized value in the future. 3. Reconnect employees with the values and the mission that made this company “bigger than itself”. Becoming a top SaaS company is not motivating to the vast majority of employees if they have only marginal incentives for achieving that goal. Qualtrics’ investors and the board either needs share a much greater portion of the equity and give employees much more lucrative LTI for the financial success of the business, OR leadership needs to develop a culture that prioritizes CSR and the collective good Qualtrics can provide the world and the communities in which we operate. The company needs to do more than simply matching employee contributions to 5fortheFight. How will Qualtrics support vulnerable and marginalized people? Promote equitable, fair, inclusive, and just policies in the community? Protect the environment? How will Qualtrics be a force for good? Demonstrating good stewardship and social governance through corporate action will make Qualtrics an employer and a brand that employees and customers can be proud of.",
        "cons": "“Fast-paced growth SaaS company” also means major organizational changes are constant; the change fatigue is real and can be a lot to manage at times (I have been with Q for 7 years and have been through at least as many re-orgs). Recent layoffs (October 2023) have dampened moral and eroded trust in the exec leadership team, but it seems like the culture is rebounding. The hybrid work policy is not for everyone. There is a significant lack of diversity amongst the leadership team- you will see women and underrepresented minorities in the executive team, but the core group of decision makers (the Founder &amp; Board Chairman, CEO, COO, Chief Product Officer, President, many sales leaders) are all white men from Provo, Utah. Since being taken private again, Qualtrics’ promotion philosophy has become much more conservative and there are fewer opportunities for accelerated advancement compared to what you might find at a pre-IPO startup. The private equity firm that owns Q is heavily focused on profit margins, which may risk product development when many competitors are investing heavily in R&amp;D for AI.",

The performance expectations are aggressive, but the bonuses are equally aggressive- exceptional work is recognized and rewarded here. It takes a lot to be exceptional with the kind of peers we have at Qualtrics, but I would rather deliver average work at this company than be a star performer some place else. The best part is the people that work here- there is a high bar for hiring and this place is filled with talented, motivated, intelligent, and empathetic people.

Respondents added additional information 40% of the time when prompted, and the new responses were more comprehensive and descriptive, including nearly four times as many words, covering a wider range of topics. Importantly, customers did not detect any change in dropout rates, or increase in perceived burden among the respondents requested to say more.\n\nIntelligent summaries, which instantly turn customer and employee feedback, and market research, into concise and simple overviews, empowering managers, researchers, marketers and customer care agents to take confident and effective action.

It makes it possible for an organisation to build an understanding of every customer and employee to create human connection at scale, so that your products and services and personalised experiences feel tailored to their needs and their preferences.\n\n“This helps engender deep loyalty among the many, not just the few, and that attracts new customers and employees while also driving down the costs to serve both.”",

Companies using Qualtrics saw their customer satisfaction metrics rise 7-12% year over year.\n\nNucleus analysts conducted in-depth interviews with six organizations using Qualtrics to understand their business challenges, their decision and deployment processes, the costs incurred, benefits achieved, and best practices learned from their deployments. The customers had annual revenues ranging from $10B to $90B. Based on customer data collected, Nucleus completed an ROI assessment of three customer deployments and validated that ROI audit with each customer's project team leadership.\n\n\"Qualtrics equips organizations with the capabilities they need to deliver superior experiences, fostering deep connections with customers and employees,\" said Brad Anderson, President of Product and Engineering at Qualtrics. \"Businesses are more focused than ever on delivering strong profits and this report shows the clear link between experience management and increased revenue, employee productivity and cost savings that have a major impact on a company's topline results.\"\n\nBad customer experiences lead directly to lost revenue, and just one negative interaction can result in losing a customer and their potential spending in the future. New Qualtrics research found that globally, organizations are putting $3.7 trillion annually at risk due to bad customer experiences, an increase of approximately $600 billion (19%) compared to projections from last year. Organizations use XM solutions to understand their greatest friction points, retain and engage top talent, and take the right action to deliver exceptional products and services.\n\nOrganizations that participated in the Nucleus research increased revenue, employee retention, customer satisfaction, and cut costs, by using the Qualtrics platform to reduce customer churn, uncover business opportunities, reduce compliance risk, and improve employee recognition. The report highlighted several significant benefits of using the Qualtrics platform.\n\nIncreased Revenue:\n\nOne organization identified common mistakes in its processes and lowered customer churn for clients due to better allocation of support resources, resulting in an annual revenue increase of $2.5 million.\n\nOne Qualtrics customer in healthcare was able to use insights from the platform to fix bugs on its website that were interfering with patient payments, increasing its annual net collection rate by approximately $1.3 million.\n\nQualtrics also played a key role in identifying and validating new business opportunities. Nucleus found that insights provided by Qualtrics enabled organizations to optimize post-pandemic reopening strategies, new product-line segmentations, and strategic merger and acquisition prospects.\n\nImproved Scalability:\n\nThanks to the platform's high scalability, some organizations managed to avoid extra per-survey expenses from their former providers, leading to yearly savings ranging from $90,000 to $650,000 by consolidating their experience management efforts into a single platform.\n\nOrganizations reduced average survey and XM technology costs by 37.5 percent, accomplished by consolidating several platform features and tools into Qualtrics. One customer was able to consolidate eight different systems into one instance of Qualtrics.\n\nThe Qualtrics platform allowed customers to do more with fewer employees – Nucleus found that avoided extraneous overhead across Qualtrics customers ranged from 1.25 to 100 full-time equivalents (FTEs) depending on the scale of the deployment.\n\nIncreased Productivity and Frontline Engagement\n\nQualtrics XM® for Customer Frontlines made a strong impact on frontline engagement.\n\nOne organization avoided having to manually capture and enter customer complaints by switching from a system without the necessary functionality, saving more than 800 hours annually.\n\nReporting was another area of improved CX efficiency, with one organization experiencing an 80 percent average decrease in time spent generating reports.\n\nBy using Qualtrics to learn about employee needs, including training requirements and new equipment, a large healthcare provider reduced caregiver turnover by 1.2 percent, saving it the cost and hassle of replacing 26 caregivers every year.\n\nThe same healthcare industry customer reduced the workload for risk executives by avoiding escalations, saving 32 hours per week on average\n\nOrganizations in the logistics and retail sectors improved employee performance by using Qualtrics to share direct feedback from customers.\n\n\"By employing an all-comprehensive experience management platform, organizations can streamline vendor management costs and complexities while reaping benefits from a singular data source, assuring effective delivery of outcomes at the intersection of customer and employee experience,\" states Research Manager Evelyn McMullen. \"Qualtrics' CrossXM product converges customer experience (CX) and employee experience (EX) data and processes to optimize decision-making and amplify business impact across different experiences.\"\n\nDownload the full Nucleus Research report to learn more.\n\nAbout Qualtrics\n\nQualtrics, the leader and creator of the experience management category, is a cloud-native software platform that empowers organizations to deliver exceptional experiences and build deep relationships with their customers and employees.

      "# [Court Approves SAP’s $12.5BN Qualtrics Sale, Dismisses Stockholders’ Conflict Claims by Rhys Fisher Fisher on 2024-07-24](https://www.cxtoday.com/voice-of-the-customer/court-approves-12-5bn-sap-qualtrics-sale-dismisses-stockholders-conflict-claims/)\nA chancery court has dismissed the suit brought forward by two Qualtrics stockholders accusing the company of favoring a conflicted offer for the $12.5 billion sale of the company in March of last year.\n\nThe class case alleged that Qualtrics and SAP – which owned a 71 percent stake in Qualtrics at the time – accepted an $18.15 per-share bid from Silver Lake and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, despite having also received a $21 offer from Thoma Bravo.\n\nCounsel for the plaintiffs claimed that the agreed deal benefitted SAP rather than the stockholders, arguing that the company chose to sell to an ally in Silver Lake rather than a rival in Thoma Bravo, costing investors and stockholders money in the process.\n\nIndeed, CX vendors within Thoma Bravo’s portfolio include Calabrio, Qlik, and – most interestingly – Qualtrics’s closest competitor, Medallia.\n\nThey also stated that the terms of the deal – which included the continuation of intercompany agreements between SAP and Qualtrics – were “generally favorable to SAP.”\n\nHowever, Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster ruled in Qualtrics and SAP’s favor, claiming that the plaintiffs were unable to prove any tangible benefit for SAP in selling to Silver Lake rather than Thoma Bravo.\n\nThis is a situation where the plaintiff needs to come up with something more. What’s required is some form of incremental benefit over the status quo that the controller would receive.\n\n“The plaintiff says the new agreement must mean that they conferred some benefit on SAP. I don’t think that’s what the law says.”\n\nLaster also questioned the accuracy of the $21 offer from Thoma Bravo, suggesting that the two deals were at completely different stages, with the $18.50 price being locked in, whereas the $21 was more open to fluctuation after deeper scrutiny.\n\n“In terms of Thoma Bravo’s response, there was never an offer of [buyer] contractual provisions. They didn’t get to the point of hiring an economic consultant to look at those types of things.\n\nFirst, $21 was an initial indication of interest from a private equity buyer. That makes it somewhat of a questionable number. That number often goes down as due diligence continues.\n\nThe Deal in Question\n\nIn March of last year, it was announced that Silver Lake and CPP Investments had acquired Qualtrics for $12.5BN.\n\nThe deal included the sale of SAP’s remaining 71 percent stake in Qualtrics, which it purchased for $8 billion in 2018.\n\nHaving spun Qualtrics into an IPO, SAP saw a significant rise in the company’s market value as well as its customer base growing from 10,000 to 18,000\n\nHowever, in spite of this, SAP had been gradually reducing its percentage since the acquisition and, following the post-pandemic tech market downturn, decided to sell its remaining stake.\n\nIn discussing the deal at the time, Zig Serafin, CEO of Qualtrics, commented:\n\nWe are incredibly excited to partner with the team at Silver Lake, who deeply understand our business and will help us continue to build a high-performing company, invest in our innovation and expand our ecosystem to help our customers succeed.\n\nMore News from Qualtrics\n\nSince the acquisition, Qualtrics has returned to being a private company and has garnered some success.\n\nMost notably, it was named a leading voice of the customer solution in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant, where it was commended for its investment in generative AI (GenAI) and its standout CX, analysis, and insight capabilities.\n\nElsewhere, during its annual X4 event in May, Qualtrics introduced the following three new apps for its XM Platform:\n\nQualtrics Frontline Locations\n\nQualtrics Frontline Digital\n\nQualtrics Frontline Care\n\nThese apps are designed to help frontline staff quickly and effectively build personalized customer connections across in-store, online, and contact center environments.\n\nThe apps also promise to enhance CX at scale by leveraging Qualtrics AI, which is informed by the world’s largest database of human sentiment.",

      "# [Duke renews contract with Qualtrics by Office of Information Technology on 2024-07-15](https://oit.duke.edu/news/duke-renews-contract-qualtrics/)\nThe university has reached an agreement on pricing, and there is no longer a risk of disruption with the Duke University/DKU-wide Qualtrics license at the end of the 2024 year. The new license covers the current volume of Qualtrics survey responses for another 5 years, through Dec 31, 2029.\n\nWho is covered under the new contract?\n\nThe contract that has been under negotiation includes users of the existing University and DKU service, as well as two other services used by the Health System:\n\nAcademic CoreXM (University/DKU)\n\nPatient Experience (Duke Health)\n\nDiscover for Contact Centers DHAS & DPC Triage (Duke Health)\n\nHow much will the new contract cost Duke?\n\nThe 2025 annual cost will be roughly 70 percent more than what the University paid in 2024 and 2.5x the license cost from 2023. However, it is a significant improvement over the initial proposed increase from the vendor which would have amounted to a 6x increase over the life of the contract, relative to 2023. The price now increases by ~3x relative to what the University paid in 2023.\n\nAn additional benefit is that the University now has a five-year contract over which to spread the increase.\n\nThe contract period also gives us more time gaining experience with current survey tools and upcoming tools on the market. We will also need to evaluate whether alternative funding options might be advisable in the future (e.g., for research projects, funding via grants may become an option).\n\nShould Duke researchers using Academic CoreXM still consider other survey tool options?\n\nIt is still important to consider other software for surveys with uncomplicated designs and where tracking longitudinal data is less essential. Duke will soon develop a request process to reduce the number of Qualtrics survey responses and, if necessary, direct them to a more appropriate survey tool. See a list of other survey tools available at Duke here: https://oit.duke.edu/service/survey-tools.\n\nUpdates on the new Qualtrics process will be shared broadly and posted on the OIT website: https://oit.duke.edu/service/qualtrics.\n\nHow do I know which tool is right for me?\n\nThe Office of Information Technology has developed a comparison chart to help Duke community members decide among various survey and forms tools - https://oit.duke.edu/help/articles/kb0037717.",

The partnership will help organizations more deeply understand relationships between quality, safety, and patient experiences.\n\nThis collaboration will move beyond traditional siloed measurement, combining key metrics and benchmarks Vizient and Qualtrics measure in order to drive meaningful improvements in patient outcomes and operational efficiency.\n\nUniversity of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann Health System, and Stanford Health Care—leaders in both clinical care and patient experience— participated in a pilot analysis for this groundbreaking initiative. The results of an initial analysis, presented this week at the Vizient Connections Summit, linked patient experience metrics such as clearer medical provider communication to important clinical outcomes, like emergency room visits, complications, and readmissions.\n\n\"Quality and patient experience are interrelated, but data is not easy to analyze at the patient level. By bringing quality, safety, and experience data together, we believe we can unlock the most impactful drivers of healthcare performance across multiple domains and the relationships between them,\" said David Levine, MD, FACEP, Chief Medical Officer for Vizient. \"This level of depth in insights has not been achieved in healthcare to date given siloed datasets and limited analytics.\"\n\n\"The initial analysis confirms so much of what we all believe: that the perception of experience is significantly related to clinical outcomes,\" said Dr. Adrienne Boissy, Chief Medical Officer, Qualtrics. \"But the thoughtful rigor of this work and the near term potential to focus improvement efforts of hardworking teams, prioritize interventions, and demonstrate value in dollars and operational gains is even more compelling.\"\n\nA New Era of Healthcare Performance Measurement\n\nHistorically, healthcare organizations have relied on siloed, retrospective data to measure performance and patient satisfaction. This new partnership between Vizient and Qualtrics will introduce a dynamic, forward-looking approach, allowing healthcare organizations to proactively manage performance and address clinical challenges before they manifest in performance data and drive continuous improvement with dynamic, actionable metrics that evolve with changing patient expectations and clinical environments.\n\nIdeal outcomes of the collaboration include:\n\nAnticipate Patient Outcomes: Harness patient feedback to predict clinical and operational outcomes, such as readmission rates, length of stay, and adverse clinical outcomes.\n\nClose the Gap Between Experience and Performance: Identify correlations between patient and clinical outcomes, providing healthcare leaders with the insights needed to address care gaps before they impact performance.\n\nDevelop Modern Experience Measurement: Define key elements of modern patient experience measurement that reflect real time performance, patient reported outcomes, and align to patient centered principles.\n\nFoundational Analyses with Leading Health Systems\n\nAn initial analysis of clinical and patient experience data from mutual clients University of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann Health System, and Stanford Health Care demonstrates the power of patient experience to drive better healthcare outcomes.\n\nKey findings included:\n\nPatients having a positive perception of communication with their caregivers was significantly associated with reductions in length of stay, 30-day readmissions, and emergency room visits.\n\nAmong inpatients with limited healthcare access, those who did not feel that their preferences were considered in their discharge plan were more likely to visit the emergency department within 30 days.\n\nBetter provider explanations could help mitigate the impact of adverse clinical events. Patients who rated provider explanations negatively exhibited significantly worse overall patient satisfaction when complications occurred, an effect that reversed when patients positively rated provider explanations.\n\nParticipating hospital leaders praised the collaboration and the insights delivered in the pilot.\n\n\"The combined analytics power of Qualtrics and Vizient allows us to break down data silos and gain actionable insights that directly enhance patient care,\" said Dan Lundergan, CEO at University of Utah Health Hospitals and Clinics. \"By understanding the connections between quality measures and patient experiences, we are better equipped to deliver high-value, patient-centered healthcare.\"\n\n\"This collaboration is a transformative step forward for health care. The ability to integrate and analyze diverse data sets in meaningful ways will power even more focused improvement efforts, ultimately fulfilling our commitment to creating more value for patients and populations,\" said Memorial Hermann Health System COO, Erin Asprec.\n\n\"We're excited to participate in this innovative collaboration with Qualtrics and Vizient,\" said David Entwistle, President and CEO of Stanford Health Care. \"By leveraging comprehensive data analysis, we can redefine patient experience and operational excellence, ensuring that every decision we make is closely aligned with our patients' needs and preferences.\"\n\nNext Steps and Industry-Wide Application\n\nOpportunities for other health systems to participate are expected to be rolled out following the completion of this initial phase with University of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann, and Stanford Health Care. The partnership will empower healthcare systems to take an innovative, data-driven approach to improving patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, positioning them for long-term success in an increasingly value-based care environment.\n\nAbout Vizient, Inc.\n\nVizient, Inc., the nation's largest provider-driven healthcare performance improvement company, serves more than 65% of the nation's acute care providers, including 97% of the nation's academic medical centers, and more than 35% of the non-acute market.

      "# [No Jitter Roll: Another Slew of Gen AI-related News from AWS, RingCentral, Qualtrics and Avaamo by Matt Vartabedian on 2024-05-03](https://www.nojitter.com/ai-automation/no-jitter-roll-another-slew-gen-ai-related-news-aws-ringcentral-qualtrics-and-avaamo)\nWelcome to this week’s No Jitter Roll, our regular roundup of product news in the communication and collaboration spaces. Leading off this week, we highlight: The general availability of Amazon Q from AWS; a new generative AI feature in Amazon Connect's Contact Lens; Talkmap's Gen AI updates to its TalkDiscovery platform; new APIs from RingCentral for AI, video and social media, as well as a workflow builder.\n\nAlso, Qualtrics launched several CX-specific solutions based on its Qualtrics AI Assist product; Avaamo launched an agent assist product for the contact center; and, SymphonyAI debuted a Gen AI copilot targeted at employees and IT staff.\n\nLastly, in the one piece of non-AI news, Calendly introduced a new Web browser extension that helps streamline meeting workflows.\n\nAmazon Q from AWS Becomes Generally Available\n\nAnnounced in late 2023, Amazon Q is now generally available. Amazon Q is a generative AI-based assistant. It is available in two broad categories: Developer and Business.\n\nAmazon Q Business\n\nAmazon Q Business can answer questions, provide summaries, generate content, and securely complete tasks based on data and information in enterprise systems. Q Business:\n\nConnects to 40+ business tools, such as wikis, intranets, Atlassian, Gmail, Microsoft Exchange, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Slack, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Q can be “pointed” at those repositories for data analysis and interaction.\n\nIntegrates with a customer’s existing identities, roles, and access permissions to personalize the interactions for each individual user. Customers can restrict sensitive topics, block keywords, and filter out inappropriate content. As with Q Developer, Q Business also does not use customer content to train the underlying models for anybody else.\n\nCreates business insight dashboards using natural language thanks to integration with Amazon QuickSight, AWS’s unified Business Intelligence (BI) service. Users can also ask questions of data beyond what is presented in the dashboards. Users can the choose to layout the content produced by Q in a document or presentation where they can customize text, images, and themes, and use Amazon Q to rewrite and improve the text.\n\nAmazon Q Developer\n\nAmazon Q Developer assists developers and other IT professionals in several ways. First, Q will generate code suggestions and recommendations in near real time while developers are coding. Customizations are private and the underlying foundation model does not use them for training.\n\nAWS noted that one of its customers, BT Group, said it accepted 37% of Q’s code suggestions while another, National Australia Bank reported 50% acceptance rates. Q can leverage a customer’s internal code base to provide more relevant and useful code recommendations.\n\nQ has another capability, called agents, which can autonomously perform various tasks, such as implementing features, documenting and refactoring code, or performing software upgrades. For example, a human developer can ask the agent to implement an application feature and the agent will then analyze existing application code and generate a step-by-step implementation plan. The human can then review and iterate on that plan before the agent implements.Lastly, Q Developer can scan code for vulnerabilities and suggest remediations. It will also help IT professional optimize and troubleshoot their AWS environment.\n\nWant to know more?\n\nCheck out analyst Sheila McGee-Smith’s thoughts on what Amazon Q brings to Amazon Connect (published in December 2023).\n\nAmazon Connect Contact Lens To Provide Gen AI-powered Agent Performance Evaluations\n\nAt Amazon Connect’s Contact Center Day, AWS announced a new generative AI feature in preview in Amazon Connect Contact Lens. The new feature provides managers with generative AI-powered recommendations for answers to questions in agent evaluation forms. Managers receive additional agent behavioral insights (e.g., did the agent show empathy while delivering bad news?) and will get context and justification for the recommended answers (i.e., reference points from the transcript that were used to provide answers).\n\nThese gen AI-powered recommendations are built using Amazon Bedrock and are available in the US West (Oregon) and US East (North Virginia) regions in the English language. During preview, this feature is included with Contact Lens performance evaluations at no additional charge. To learn more, visit Amazon Connect’s documentation and webpage.\n\nTalkmap Unveils TalkDiscovery Version 8.3\n\nThe provider of generative AI-powered contact center solutions announced version 8.3 of its TalkDiscovery platform. The new release introduces two new generative AI platform features: Conversation Summaries and Contact Intents. Contact Intents is a standalone data attribute that is generated for each conversation. It identifies the customer’s “main reason” why they contacted the contact center. Note that this is in addition to the platform recording all turn-level customer intents. Conversation Summaries have been supported by TalkDiscovery for several years; this new version is a revamped approach to generating those summaries.\n\nRingCentral Launches RingSense AI APIs and Workflow Builder\n\nThe AI-driven UCaaS, CCaaS, video and hybrid event solution provider made several announcements, including new RingSense AI APIS with which customers can generate audio and video transcriptions, summarizations, and speaker diarization (attributing audio segments within a recording to individual speakers) across RingCentral and third-party generated recordings.\n\nRingCentral’s new video APIs and SDK will allow developers to integrate live video meetings and interactions into their applications through a white-labeled experience with built-in customizability, closed captioning, and chat. With the social messaging APIs, can integrate with nine different social media platforms (all the major ones). These new APIs are available in beta to RingCentral Video Pro+ and RingEX customers, free of charge.\n\nThe new RingCentral Workflow Builder allows customers to create workflows from pre-built or custom templates. The pre-built templates include automatic, canned responses for out-of-office replies, SMS keyword autoreplies, voicemail received notifications via SMS and after-hours SMS autoreplies. These new capabilities can handle more complex triggers, for example creating automated, personalized responses to an exact phone number match of an incoming SMS message or transcribing a voicemail to trigger actions based on its content.\n\nQualtrics AI to Improve CX In-Store, Online, and in the Call Center\n\nThe experience management solution provider announced its Qualtrics AI-powered Frontline Locations, Frontline Digital and Frontline Care solutions. Underlying these several CX related solutions is Qualtrics AI Assist, a platform-wide Gen AI agent that allows users to ask natural language questions about data and receive a response based on a company’s own data. Qualtrics AI Assist can generate summaries and trigger workflows.\n\nQualtrics Frontline Locations Assist is a hub that analyzes customer feedback – from surveys, within apps, the contact center, online, and reviews – to provide frontline managers with insights and recommended steps to improve customer experience.\n\nThe Qualtrics AI-powered Frontline Digital solution provides similar insights but for a Web site, such as heatmaps, funnel analytics and real-time frustration ‘interception’ which enables business to identify customers experiencing challenges with the company’s site in real time and offer targeted support in the moment.\n\nQualtrics Frontline Care includes Customer Care Assist, which aggregates insights and workflows across the customer care experience which a manager could use to generate per-agent coaching plans. It also uses Qualtrics AI to automatically summarize customer feedback which frontline teams can use to generate support tickets, send follow-up emails and/or create knowledge base articles.\n\nQualtrics Frontline Location Assist is available in private preview, as are the Digital solutions. Qualtrics Customer Care Assist is in private preview and Automated Call Summaries is generally available today.\n\nAvaamo Launches AI-Powered Agent Assist Copilot\n\nThe autonomous agent platform provider for customer service operations launched its Avaamo Agent Assist Copilot which uses generative AI throughout the call to:\n\nRoute calls based on caller intent to the agents best suited to handle those types of calls while also mining relevant CRM data, previous requests, historical interactions, etc.\n\nProvide agent assistance during the call based on what the customer is saying. This assistance draws on unique customer data, public information, standard operating procedure (SOP) documents, and more. The copilot will also recommend a “next best action” and via robotic process automation (RPA) integration with backends systems, the copilot can also automate some tasks.\n\nAssign tags, extract topics, track promises made to customers, and update customer records during the call and after the interaction completes.\n\nAgent Assist Copilot joins Avaamo’s Suite of Generative AI tools, including LLaMB, Avaamo IVA, Avaamo Outreach, and Avaamo Live Agent.\n\nSymphonyAI Launches Generative AI-based Apex Enterprise IT Copilot\n\nThe predictive and generative enterprise AI SaaS provider unveiled Apex Enterprise IT Copilot, a generative AI-based assistant for end users, IT analysts and executives. Depending on the type of end user, the copilot will provide self-serve assistance via knowledge articles, work prioritization, insights around trends, and more. The copilot is part of SymphonyAI Apex, a predictive and generative AI-based IT service management/enterprise service management platform. The copilot and Apex are powered by SymphonyAI’s Eureka Gen AI platform.\n\nCalendly Delivers New Web Browser Extension for Meeting Workflows\n\nThe centralized scheduling automation platform announced a new Calendly web browser extension for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, and a similar add-in for Outlook. Via a new meetings tab (pictured below), users can see all meetings in one place, view contact details and meeting history, schedule meetings on behalf of a team member, and book meetings from the extension without task- or app-switching. The extension is available here.\n\nThis Week on No Jitter\n\nIn case you missed them, here are some of our top stories:\n\nUser Adoption and Training Is Key for AI Growth: Can you boldly go where no man has gone before without proper training?
