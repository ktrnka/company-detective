This license is built for business and has lots of analytics bells and whistles that are useless for research, and it also costs over double the annual subscription cost.\n\nMy SLAC is having a hard time justifying this price hike, so we're looking at alternative platforms.  We need something on par with Qualtrics in terms of question and output types, and the ability to have custom branding would be ideal (i.e. I don't want participants to be redirected to a random SurveyMonkey page after completing the survey).\n\nFor comparison, a site-wide license (unlimited responses) for my college with ~1200 students used to be $7500/year. Now it is limited to 1000 users and 25,000 responses for $15,000/year. We have been able to negotiate both of these prices down a little, but we're still looking at a $5k increase for more-restricted usage.\n\n## Comment ID jfqm2cy with +2 score by [(cequims, Reddit, 2023-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/jfqm2cy/) (in reply to ID 11ss3vs):\nJust got off the phone with our Qualtrics rep, and it's clear they have no interest in serving small businesses. They want to more or less double our license cost. I last did my research on different survey platforms about a year ago, and at that time I liked [Survey Sparrow](https://www.surveysparrow.com), so check them out.\n\n### Comment ID ke5j3n0 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/ke5j3n0/) (in reply to ID jfqm2cy):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID kxp1oz9 with +1 score by [(cequims, Reddit, 2024-04-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/kxp1oz9/) (in reply to ID ke5j3n0):\nSorry for the slow reply - I don't get on Reddit much. So far, I'm pretty happy with SurveySparrow. The features are sufficiently complex for just about everything our company needs to do across our many projects. The question options aren't as customizable as Qualtrics, and the automated reports could use a few improvements, but for the drastically lower cost I am happy to make adjustments to work with the available options. I will say that customer service is a bit spotty. They are often (but not always) available right away via their chat feature. I think most of their team is located in India, however, and sometimes time zone differences are an issue. My colleague on Pacific time tends says they often don't get back to her til the next day. I'm on East Coast time, and it's less of an issue. I also sometimes worry that because they are a smaller company, they may be less stable and more likely to have tech issues. For example, I once found that I couldn't edit data on the back end, then the next day it worked. And right now, there's a weird formatting issue where text is overlapping in the footer of the surveys. So there are definitely small signs that they are more scrappy than the big leagues. But our team of about 16 employees has been using it for about 10 months now, and it hasn't held us back.\n\n## Comment ID kzw0jm1 with +1 score by [(Spiritual-Dance-562, Reddit, 2024-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/kzw0jm1/) (in reply to ID 11ss3vs):\nQualtrics is clearly trying to eliminate small businesses.

Plus, as opposed to Qualtrics, Survicate is a small company that understands and values all of its customers, so surely you'd be able to get a good deal.

It enables users to create forms, surveys, and workflows with ease, along with various integration options. Furthermore, it might not offer the same level of interactivity and dynamic content creation, especially when it comes to creating calculators and assessments.\n\n\r  \n**SurveyGizmo**: It is a versatile survey and data collection platform that allows users to create surveys, quizzes, and forms.

      "# Post ID 11ss012: Qualtrics alternatives? with +29 score by [(hello_kitteh, Reddit, 2023-03-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/11ss012/qualtrics_alternatives/)\nAny recommendations for Qualtrics alternatives?\n\nAs many of you may know, Qualtrics has recently gotten rid of their Research/Academia license and is moving everyone over to the CoreXM license. This license is built for business and has lots of analytics bells and whistles that are useless for research, and it also costs over double the annual subscription cost.\n\nMy SLAC is having a hard time justifying this price hike, so we're looking at alternative platforms.  We need something on par with Qualtrics in terms of question and output types, and the ability to have custom branding would be ideal (i.e. I don't want participants to be redirected to a random SurveyMonkey page after completing the survey).\n\nFor comparison, a site-wide license (unlimited responses) for my college with ~1200 students used to be $7500/year. Now it is limited to 1000 users and 25,000 responses for $15,000/year. We have been able to negotiate both of these prices down a little, but we're still looking at a $5k increase for more-restricted usage.\n\n## Comment ID jcinizm with +7 score by [(cattyditty, Reddit, 2023-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/11ss012/qualtrics_alternatives/jcinizm/) (in reply to ID 11ss012):\nREDCap!

The number of surveys I've done that lack page breaks is astounding. Seeing more than about 10 questions on a single page is overwhelming for most people and increases your chances of accidentally skipped questions.\n\nFor question matrices with Likert scale items, ensure that the labels for the response options appear at the top and the middle of the matrix (not just the top). You can change this in question settings. This will help to ensure that respondents don't have to keep scrolling to the top of the page to see the the response options. People will forget what the response options are, especially if you have a larger number of response options. \n\nSet the questions to \"request response\". This will flag skipped questions for participants so they are asked if they want to continue the survey without answering a skipped question. This doesn't work for matrices though.\n\nUse multie blocks as you're setting up your survey. For example, if you have demographics questions, mental health questions, and substance use questions, put all of your demographics questions in one block, your mental health questions in second block, and your substance use questions in a third block.  This is for YOUR sake. It's easier to find/edit/move questions when you have multipe blocks rather than what could be 100+ questions placed into a single block. Using multipe blocks also makes setting up survey flow and skip logic more effective/efficient.\n\n## Comment ID ljzodjv with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-08-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/ljzodjv/) (in reply to ID 101qloz):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID lkbuqjj with +1 score by [(barrybulsara, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/lkbuqjj/) (in reply to ID ljzodjv):\n/u/Odd-Courage- is a bot account.\n\n## Comment ID lk4rvn9 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/lk4rvn9/) (in reply to ID 101qloz):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID lkbuj74 with +1 score by [(barrybulsara, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/lkbuj74/) (in reply to ID lk4rvn9):\n/u/Odd-Courage- is a bot account.\n\n## Comment ID j2qfltq with +1 score by [(Decent-Reception-232, Reddit, 2023-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/j2qfltq/) (in reply to ID 101qloz):\n1.

This list is a mix of pros and cons and is in no particular order:\n\n- the survey design functionality itself is superior to what you would find with most vendors.\n- data visualization through dashboards is highly effective for standard org use cases (eg manager and exec dashboards, filtering, etc.). The fact that your data lives in the same platform makes data eng work unnecessary.\n- the dashboards themselves are limited though if you're trying to do anything \"highly rigorous\" like include estimates based on weighting. \n- if you're looking to develop an organizational survey program Qualtrics will have everything you need for pretty much any use case an exec leadership team could currently dream up. However, Qualtrics is not built to support weekly or daily surveying. \n- Qualtrics employee survey platform is frustratingly more limited than their CX platform (see weighting issue above)\n- NLP capability is poor, but it is better than most other vendors. It will probably improve over time now that they have acquired Clarabridge (i think that's the name of the company anyway)\n- Qualtrics is $$$ and is likely going to become even more so in the future \n\nDifficult to know what to focus on without knowing your intended use case, but hopefully this is helpful!\n\n### Comment ID le79r9j with +1 score by [(ZestyMuffin85496, Reddit, 2024-07-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/le79r9j/) (in reply to ID haqn6tm):\nwould qualrics release your name to your employer if they stated they are supposed to be anonymous?\n\n## Comment ID hass6s3 with +4 score by [(armyprof, Reddit, 2021-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/hass6s3/) (in reply to ID pdiz5m):\nLet me preface my thoughts with some context.\n\nI’ve been the admin and key user for Qualtrics for two global companies for eight years now…I also do consulting on the side.  I have two certifications with them as well; the XM CM platforms.  My graduate work was in research methods and survey research was a big part of it.\n\nQualtrics has a lot going for it and has some problems too.  Overall I recommend it, but here’s a breakdown.\n\nPros:\n\nThe customer service is very good.  If you call you’ll get help.  In eight years and who knows how many calls I’ve yet to not get an answer to a question.  Sometimes the answer is no, but I’ve never had trouble reaching anyone or felt like they didn’t know what they were doing.  \n\n2:  the survey platform itself is pretty robust and will do about anything you need it too with a few exceptions.  And it’s pretty easy and intuitive to use.\n\n3:  the new tools like text and stats IQ or the cross tab tool are fantastic enhancements.  \n\n4:  the dashboard tool is excellent for helping other users explore their data.\n\nCons:\n\n1:  it’s expensive.\n\n2:  there are certain baffling features that it should have but doesn’t.  For example, being able to independently recode or reverse code items in a matrix, or device in what aggregation you want for scoring instead of just a sum.\n\n3:  reporting is a bit clunky.  They used to have a fantastic report tool that was super flexible.  But they dumbed it down to make it easier for beginners to use but less powerful.  You can’t, for example, resize the height of rows in tables or put things on the page freely.  \n\nOverall I find it a good tool, and use it successfully with client work constantly.  I do wish they’d listen to some suggestions sometimes, but overall I’m very satisfied with it.  \n\nGood luck!\n\n### Comment ID hatid6q with +1 score by [(Bite-Expensive, Reddit, 2021-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/hatid6q/) (in reply to ID hass6s3):\nThank you for the thorough overview!

So let’s say you have a matrix question with ten items on a 1-5 Likert scale.  With StatsIQ you can then do, say, an ANOVA on all those items or any subset of them by picking an IV (like ethnicity).  You’ll get all your results like significance, effect size, etc.  Super handy.\n\nText IQ is text analytics.  Topic/subtopics, and sentiment analysis.  Also super handy.\n\nThese can be used together.  You could, for example, do a comparison of means on a question using your sentiment categories as IVs.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n## Comment ID hatfq0s with +4 score by [(kongfukinny, Reddit, 2021-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/hatfq0s/) (in reply to ID pdiz5m):\nI’ve been running survey programs for some time now. Worked with and demoed various tools and currently using Qualtrics. Here’s my high level summary:\n\n1. Ur tool will depend on your needs. My company really likes to do surveys and they love to ask all sorts of wonky display logic type questions as well as create forms for events and other various use cases for surveys. This is really where Qualtrics shines over other tools. It has so many features that you can literally do anything with it. That said, if your looking for the simple most effective platform for engagement surveys, Qualtrics is not it.\n\n2. Cost is moderate IMO. It depends on the size of your business but it’s not the most expensive solution out there. I was quoted by Glint at twice the rate we pay for Qualtrics.\n\n3. Dashboards and analytics suck in Qualtrics. Tools like Glint or Peakon automate all the dash boarding for you. Qualtrics dashboarding and analytics is super admin cost heavy and isn’t nearly as robust something like PowerBI. That said if you have the resources, there is an SFTP integration with Qualtrics that could allow you to automate a pipeline to SQL and be able to automate dashboards for recurring surveys.\n\n4. Support for the most part is pretty bad. This surprised me. I work for a reputable tech company that I would think Qualtrics would consider a high profile client. It took us to threatening to end the contract early for them to switch us to a more involved CSM. This was night and day compares to when I previously used Glint where our CSM was always on top of things and helpful.\n\n5. Their “science” isn’t very scientific IMO. They have a hard time giving me straight answers on where their questions come from, why they design questions the way they do, or what research supports their validity and reliability. This again is unlock other platforms I’ve used which are happy to share white papers and research to support the utility of their measures.\n\nTL;DR and going back to your original question about what they provide that others don’t, we’ll not much really. But again, it depends on your needs. They provide dashboards but not automated like some platforms. They provide question banks but validity is questionable compared to other platforms. Their big sell is in their wide ranging features, but if your use case is simply engagement surveys, these might not be useful to you.\n\n### Comment ID hathqz3 with +2 score by [(Bite-Expensive, Reddit, 2021-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/hathqz3/) (in reply to ID hatfq0s):\nThank you for such a thoughtful response!\n\n## Comment ID haqj466 with +3 score by [(aeywaka, Reddit, 2021-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/haqj466/) (in reply to ID pdiz5m):\nFrome someone not currently able to use qualtrics (would take a large initiative to implement).

Their crowdsourcing services produce low quality data, customer service unhelpful, and actual survey system is static with no new developments to do sound, rigorous data collection. More and more they are chasing enterprise solutions, new markets, and feel increasingly like the SPSS of survey solutions. They would rather spend a ton of money on huge fluff events with oprah as a speaker than actually build out their tools.\n\nThe only advantages include it is easy to use, has a few nice embedding and mail survey features, and offers both the storage and interface for data collection. While I don't have an immediate alternative I would seriously consider any other I/O or research oriented survey platform as they can easily mimic an easy user interface but provide a much better platform with more capabilities.\n\n## Comment ID jd44nu6 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-03-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/jd44nu6/) (in reply to ID pdiz5m):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID jd44nvk with +1 score by [(AutoModerator, Reddit, 2023-03-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/jd44nvk/) (in reply to ID jd44nu6):\nYou are a new user with less than two weeks of reddit activity.

The information I find suggests that users own the data on surveymonkey instead of the platform, at least as of Apr 2022.\n\n## Comment ID gm3zd1y with +2 score by [(dudeweresmyvan, Reddit, 2021-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXResearch/comments/ld675f/argument_for_qualtrics_vs_surveymonkey/gm3zd1y/) (in reply to ID ld675f):\nI've only played around a little with qualtrics enterprise and there's a lot I know I don't know, as it offers very advanced features. (I'd use it more if it wasn't against company policy) Does survey monkey offer maxdiffs or choice based conjoint? If not, maybe marketers can get behind those features alone. \n\nThat said, I'm not yet convinced that qualtrics is a replacement for tools like optional workshop, but you may be able to finagle it just enough. \n\nBut it depends on what you're research goals are.\n\n## Comment ID gm5qwbt with +2 score by [(mmmarcin, Reddit, 2021-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXResearch/comments/ld675f/argument_for_qualtrics_vs_surveymonkey/gm5qwbt/) (in reply to ID ld675f):\nSurvey routing logic is way more time consuming in Surveymonkey (and sometimes does not match what Qualtrics can do period). Surveymonkey forces me to compromise the design of my surveys because I’m not able to pipe from certain question types or route in the way I want. My impression is that Surveymonkey started as primarily a marketing survey tool and is better for more simple survey designs.\n\n## Comment ID lhweprj with +1 score by [(Odd-Courage-, Reddit, 2024-08-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXResearch/comments/ld675f/argument_for_qualtrics_vs_surveymonkey/lhweprj/) (in reply to ID ld675f):\nI've seen SurveySparrow as a great alternative; it blends the ease of SurveyMonkey with engaging, conversational forms that can rival Qualtrics in versatility!\n\n## Comment ID ljc7c81 with +1 score by [(Odd-Courage-, Reddit, 2024-08-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXResearch/comments/ld675f/argument_for_qualtrics_vs_surveymonkey/ljc7c81/) (in reply to ID ld675f):\nIf you're debating between Qualtrics and SurveyMonkey for advanced user research, here's the lowdown:\n\n* **Qualtrics** is top-tier if you're diving deep. It's perfect for complex analyses like hotspot testing which is great for interactive prototypes.\n* **SurveyMonkey** is super user-friendly and wallet-friendly, great for straightforward surveys.\n\nIf these tools feel like overkill or you're eyeing something fresh, maybe give SurveySparrow a shot. It's slick, simple to use, and packs some punchy features for engaging surveys. Plus, it won't bust your budget. It might be just what you need!\n\n## Comment ID gm5v8du with +1 score by [(beatlebill, Reddit, 2021-02-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXResearch/comments/ld675f/argument_for_qualtrics_vs_surveymonkey/gm5v8du/) (in reply to ID ld675f):\nSurveymonkey used to be a lot cheaper than it was. I do feel that Qualtrics provides more professional looking surveys and emails to users.\n\n## Comment ID k5ggwmj with +1 score by [(herci1, Reddit, 2023-10-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXResearch/comments/ld675f/argument_for_qualtrics_vs_surveymonkey/k5ggwmj/) (in reply to ID ld675f):\nIf you need something powerful like Qualtrics but on the budget, you may want to check out [Survicate](https://survicate.com) .\n\n## Comment ID kp6zs2e with +1 score by [(paulinahryn, Reddit, 2024-02-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXResearch/comments/ld675f/argument_for_qualtrics_vs_surveymonkey/kp6zs2e/) (in reply to ID ld675f):\nFor a solution that strikes the perfect balance between advanced functionality and user-friendliness, [Survicate](https://survicate.com/) is your go-to.

          "advice": "Don’t risk selling long-term competitive advantages and strategic value differentiators for short-term ROI and immediate profit margins. Qualtrics’ platform is ripe for disruption if we do not stay at the bleeding edge of emerging technology. To do this, Silver Lake, ELT, and the board need to be willing to invest heavily in the people that make this business special. Qualtrics had the rise that it did (and created generational wealth for many people, especially much of the board and the leadership team) because of the hard work of a mission-driven team. If Qualtrics is going to do this again and hit 10X or 100X value multiples and become a generational SaaS company, issues with employee engagement and retention of top talent need to be addressed immediately. Here is what I would recommend: 1. Qualtrics needs to rebuild a culture of trust and collaboration, and that has to be driven through transparency and accountability at the very top. If leaders signal that they trust employees and want them to succeed, employees will trust leadership to guide them. 2. Invest heavily in systems, processes, and people. Qualtrics has significant needs for enterprise systems that work together (for example, the CRM and HRIS are poorly integrated with the other systems that they rely on). The new promotion philosophy makes sense from a cost-saving standpoint, but Qualtrics should not be cost-saving if that means we’re losing top talent that would deliver outsized value in the future. 3. Reconnect employees with the values and the mission that made this company “bigger than itself”. Becoming a top SaaS company is not motivating to the vast majority of employees if they have only marginal incentives for achieving that goal. Qualtrics’ investors and the board either needs share a much greater portion of the equity and give employees much more lucrative LTI for the financial success of the business, OR leadership needs to develop a culture that prioritizes CSR and the collective good Qualtrics can provide the world and the communities in which we operate. The company needs to do more than simply matching employee contributions to 5fortheFight. How will Qualtrics support vulnerable and marginalized people? Promote equitable, fair, inclusive, and just policies in the community? Protect the environment? How will Qualtrics be a force for good? Demonstrating good stewardship and social governance through corporate action will make Qualtrics an employer and a brand that employees and customers can be proud of.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "“Fast-paced growth SaaS company” also means major organizational changes are constant; the change fatigue is real and can be a lot to manage at times (I have been with Q for 7 years and have been through at least as many re-orgs). Recent layoffs (October 2023) have dampened moral and eroded trust in the exec leadership team, but it seems like the culture is rebounding. The hybrid work policy is not for everyone. There is a significant lack of diversity amongst the leadership team- you will see women and underrepresented minorities in the executive team, but the core group of decision makers (the Founder &amp; Board Chairman, CEO, COO, Chief Product Officer, President, many sales leaders) are all white men from Provo, Utah. Since being taken private again, Qualtrics’ promotion philosophy has become much more conservative and there are fewer opportunities for accelerated advancement compared to what you might find at a pre-IPO startup. The private equity firm that owns Q is heavily focused on profit margins, which may risk product development when many competitors are investing heavily in R&amp;D for AI.",

The best part is the people that work here- there is a high bar for hiring and this place is filled with talented, motivated, intelligent, and empathetic people. The frontline managers and middle managers are generally very good and they care deeply about the success of their teams and their people. The leadership team is committed and competent (most have been with the company for years).",

And with full realization that no one is perfect, and success is messy and employees can't just blame management for their own shortcomings and should look in the mirror more often. Guilty as charged.  But management seems to be missing just one critical awareness.\n\nSome things even XM can't measure.  X Data helps, but it will never tell the whole story. Do things to build trust and connection and social capital that don't make sense on your financial statements.  Don't tell the employees that they wanted more money and less parties based on their own survey responses. Give them both.  Don't remind them that it will all be worth it because of the money they will make and the financial strategy for the stage of growth and the market we are in, and this new level of chess that private equity is taking us to. That will not fix the core structural issue that the people at this company are not as connected with a sense of meaning and belonging as deeply as they used to be even if on the engagement surveys lots of people say they have a best friend at the organization, and they like their manager.    The cost of ignoring that unseen disconnection, far outweighs any \"frivolous\" expense incurred to foster relationships again.  In my experience, Qualtrics is made up of some of the most brilliant and great people in the world who want to work hard and be consistent and inclusive and do what is right and celebrate together when they all get rich or richer if they catch the curve right and persevere.  They are proud to work there and of what Qualtrics can do and the impact its having in the world, and are willing to stick with it through almost anything and forgive all the mistakes and let downs and overpromises while they watch executives who urged them to play the long game, strategically take their shares and run.  But it seems like despite all your knowledge and experience and resources and expertise and the respect of your brand, you are messing up one thing that you can't mess up...\n\nYou can't be customer-obsessed if you don't treat every single one of your employees as your most important customers.  \n\nAccountability can co-exist with this, and you can keep your investors happy. And the employees are not usually as spoiled or entitled or ungrateful as they might seem.  They are just tired and disconnected.  Don't just say that employee experience engagement has gotten better based on quarter-over-quarter survey results.   No one cares.  Its interesting insight, but no one who is not responsible for that number actually cares about that number.  And its only going to frustrate them  to hear that win if they don't feel it.  It has to be something shared and palpable that only a human can sense. Use AI and stats and surveys and dashboards for everything else.  Make the investors happy.  But go back to making the employees first.  That's how you got here.  Thanks for all the years and work and risks taken you have provided and sacrificed to make it possible.  You deserve it.  No shame.  Just consider it. ",

          "cons": "Take this with a grain of salt. But they forfeited their internal culture to keep winning bigger and faster. I hope they get it back. They had a harder and harder time adapting to their own rapid and relentless growth and success as time went on. I think they tried hard, but it just had so much unchecked momentum, that it became chaotic and disjointed to respond to the sheer amount of work and demand it created. Hiring more rapidly didn't fix the problem. There was a lot of collateral damage in the operational cohesiveness and culture of one team that was previously in the org. Lots of conflicting incentives had gradually developed that didn't get addressed enough or mapped or aligned very well along the way, so the individuals who desperately needed to work together with a benevolent mindset across departments had progressively lower natural motivation or patience to keep playing as a team. But they are working on it.",

They cut their entire DEI team and the high level people at the company are primarily all white mormon men. Women and BIPOC people are grossly underrepresented. - They will not consider hiring people who do not have a 4-year college degree which is a really outdated and classist practice. - The general vibe especially in the Utah office is cult-like and oozes toxic bro culture. - Mormon culture seeps into company culture and is uncomfortable for non-LDS - The general strategy for where the product is going is a total mess and real innovation is extremely hard. It's more arguments than productivity. - Because of terrible leadership moral is at an all time low - Back in the day, I would've recommended working at Qualtrics to anyone.

A lot more work in every area with no additional compensation and not promoting people (a month after being laid off I’m making significantly more at a different company, doing the same thing for way less accounts). Management’s inability to listen (starting with skip level manager and up to company management) was shocking. Lots of burn out. Many people were happy to be in the lay-off group and many were sad they weren’t. Somehow the company manages to attract amazing people, so I genuinely hope they’re able to turn things around and rebuild. Really grateful for everything I learned at Q and wish them the best!",

Product is also incredibly boring to work on although I don't personally mind as long as working hours stay low. Not a single person in the C-suite deserves to be there. They are driving the company away from being a survey platform (which we excel at) to being a management suggestion tool (which we're bad at and customers don't need). They set on this path when the economy was good, and many customers were shelling out for a luxury product and making decisions based on employee and customer feedback. But now that the tech economy is bad, decision making is driven only by profit, making Qualtrics' experience management insights irrelevant. For example, Qualtrics can tell Delta that customers want extra leg room on flights. But Delta doesn't care, they need the money from those 3 extra rows. It is a rare case when Qualtrics can provide an insight that 1.) is novel and 2.) is actionable in a profitable way.",

There are opportunities for progression, but it is mostly in positions that are entry level (Technical Account Manager, Enterprise Support, and Resolution Analyst.) Enterprise Support does the same work, but gets paid more. It would drive me crazy when people in that team would ask me questions, and I would just think that I have the same learning and training, and they're getting paid more than me to do the same work. Pretty annoying. \n\nThis is a crappy call center job that is masked by fancy HR lingo!!!! Beware!!!",

They cut their entire DEI team and the high level people at the company are primarily all white mormon men. Women and BIPOC people are grossly underrepresented. - They will not consider hiring people who do not have a 4-year college degree which is a really outdated and classist practice. - The general vibe especially in the Utah office is cult-like and oozes toxic bro culture. - Mormon culture seeps into company culture and is uncomfortable for non-LDS - The general strategy for where the product is going is a total mess and real innovation is extremely hard.

Big layoffs recently, many jobs moved to lower cost locations and other countries, no leadership accountability whatsoever. Total chaos followed. RTO enforcement coming. Pay cuts (or absence of refreshers) likely coming. Everyone good is looking to leave soon. Product is also incredibly boring to work on although I don't personally mind as long as working hours stay low. Not a single person in the C-suite deserves to be there. They are driving the company away from being a survey platform (which we excel at) to being a management suggestion tool (which we're bad at and customers don't need). They set on this path when the economy was good, and many customers were shelling out for a luxury product and making decisions based on employee and customer feedback. But now that the tech economy is bad, decision making is driven only by profit, making Qualtrics' experience management insights irrelevant. For example, Qualtrics can tell Delta that customers want extra leg room on flights. But Delta doesn't care, they need the money from those 3 extra rows. It is a rare case when Qualtrics can provide an insight that 1.) is novel and 2.) is actionable in a profitable way.",

        "advice": "Don’t risk selling long-term competitive advantages and strategic value differentiators for short-term ROI and immediate profit margins. Qualtrics’ platform is ripe for disruption if we do not stay at the bleeding edge of emerging technology. To do this, Silver Lake, ELT, and the board need to be willing to invest heavily in the people that make this business special. Qualtrics had the rise that it did (and created generational wealth for many people, especially much of the board and the leadership team) because of the hard work of a mission-driven team. If Qualtrics is going to do this again and hit 10X or 100X value multiples and become a generational SaaS company, issues with employee engagement and retention of top talent need to be addressed immediately. Here is what I would recommend: 1. Qualtrics needs to rebuild a culture of trust and collaboration, and that has to be driven through transparency and accountability at the very top. If leaders signal that they trust employees and want them to succeed, employees will trust leadership to guide them. 2. Invest heavily in systems, processes, and people. Qualtrics has significant needs for enterprise systems that work together (for example, the CRM and HRIS are poorly integrated with the other systems that they rely on). The new promotion philosophy makes sense from a cost-saving standpoint, but Qualtrics should not be cost-saving if that means we’re losing top talent that would deliver outsized value in the future. 3. Reconnect employees with the values and the mission that made this company “bigger than itself”. Becoming a top SaaS company is not motivating to the vast majority of employees if they have only marginal incentives for achieving that goal. Qualtrics’ investors and the board either needs share a much greater portion of the equity and give employees much more lucrative LTI for the financial success of the business, OR leadership needs to develop a culture that prioritizes CSR and the collective good Qualtrics can provide the world and the communities in which we operate. The company needs to do more than simply matching employee contributions to 5fortheFight. How will Qualtrics support vulnerable and marginalized people? Promote equitable, fair, inclusive, and just policies in the community? Protect the environment? How will Qualtrics be a force for good? Demonstrating good stewardship and social governance through corporate action will make Qualtrics an employer and a brand that employees and customers can be proud of.",
        "cons": "“Fast-paced growth SaaS company” also means major organizational changes are constant; the change fatigue is real and can be a lot to manage at times (I have been with Q for 7 years and have been through at least as many re-orgs). Recent layoffs (October 2023) have dampened moral and eroded trust in the exec leadership team, but it seems like the culture is rebounding. The hybrid work policy is not for everyone. There is a significant lack of diversity amongst the leadership team- you will see women and underrepresented minorities in the executive team, but the core group of decision makers (the Founder &amp; Board Chairman, CEO, COO, Chief Product Officer, President, many sales leaders) are all white men from Provo, Utah. Since being taken private again, Qualtrics’ promotion philosophy has become much more conservative and there are fewer opportunities for accelerated advancement compared to what you might find at a pre-IPO startup. The private equity firm that owns Q is heavily focused on profit margins, which may risk product development when many competitors are investing heavily in R&amp;D for AI.",

The performance expectations are aggressive, but the bonuses are equally aggressive- exceptional work is recognized and rewarded here. It takes a lot to be exceptional with the kind of peers we have at Qualtrics, but I would rather deliver average work at this company than be a star performer some place else. The best part is the people that work here- there is a high bar for hiring and this place is filled with talented, motivated, intelligent, and empathetic people. The frontline managers and middle managers are generally very good and they care deeply about the success of their teams and their people.

And with full realization that no one is perfect, and success is messy and employees can't just blame management for their own shortcomings and should look in the mirror more often. Guilty as charged.  But management seems to be missing just one critical awareness.\n\nSome things even XM can't measure.  X Data helps, but it will never tell the whole story. Do things to build trust and connection and social capital that don't make sense on your financial statements.  Don't tell the employees that they wanted more money and less parties based on their own survey responses. Give them both.  Don't remind them that it will all be worth it because of the money they will make and the financial strategy for the stage of growth and the market we are in, and this new level of chess that private equity is taking us to. That will not fix the core structural issue that the people at this company are not as connected with a sense of meaning and belonging as deeply as they used to be even if on the engagement surveys lots of people say they have a best friend at the organization, and they like their manager.    The cost of ignoring that unseen disconnection, far outweighs any \"frivolous\" expense incurred to foster relationships again.  In my experience, Qualtrics is made up of some of the most brilliant and great people in the world who want to work hard and be consistent and inclusive and do what is right and celebrate together when they all get rich or richer if they catch the curve right and persevere.  They are proud to work there and of what Qualtrics can do and the impact its having in the world, and are willing to stick with it through almost anything and forgive all the mistakes and let downs and overpromises while they watch executives who urged them to play the long game, strategically take their shares and run.  But it seems like despite all your knowledge and experience and resources and expertise and the respect of your brand, you are messing up one thing that you can't mess up...\n\nYou can't be customer-obsessed if you don't treat every single one of your employees as your most important customers.  \n\nAccountability can co-exist with this, and you can keep your investors happy. And the employees are not usually as spoiled or entitled or ungrateful as they might seem.  They are just tired and disconnected.  Don't just say that employee experience engagement has gotten better based on quarter-over-quarter survey results.   No one cares.  Its interesting insight, but no one who is not responsible for that number actually cares about that number.  And its only going to frustrate them  to hear that win if they don't feel it.  It has to be something shared and palpable that only a human can sense. Use AI and stats and surveys and dashboards for everything else.  Make the investors happy.  But go back to making the employees first.  That's how you got here.  Thanks for all the years and work and risks taken you have provided and sacrificed to make it possible.  You deserve it.  No shame.  Just consider it. ",
        "cons": "Take this with a grain of salt. But they forfeited their internal culture to keep winning bigger and faster. I hope they get it back. They had a harder and harder time adapting to their own rapid and relentless growth and success as time went on. I think they tried hard, but it just had so much unchecked momentum, that it became chaotic and disjointed to respond to the sheer amount of work and demand it created. Hiring more rapidly didn't fix the problem. There was a lot of collateral damage in the operational cohesiveness and culture of one team that was previously in the org. Lots of conflicting incentives had gradually developed that didn't get addressed enough or mapped or aligned very well along the way, so the individuals who desperately needed to work together with a benevolent mindset across departments had progressively lower natural motivation or patience to keep playing as a team. But they are working on it.",
        "lengthOfEmployment": 6,
        "pros": "I think anyone should take an opportunity to work here as a great thing. It was an incredible ride and totally worth all the ups and downs. So much learning and skill development and exposure to a huge network of incredibly smart and talented people and industries in all walks of life. You will make more and more money sooner or later. And the people who stay and produce and contribute long enough for the next exit will be in a really solid spot financially.",

Because the number of choices are carried forward from previous questions, ALL might equal anything between 1 and 12 depending on the respondent.\n\nI’ve also investigated using Display Logic on Q5, but again I’m unsure how to specify “Display Q5 only if there is at least one unselected choice from Q4.”\n\nFYI I would like to avoid adding text to Q5 that says something like, “If no answer choices are displayed, please continue the survey” but I fear I might have to do just that if I cannot automate the skip / display logic.\n\nThank you for any advice or guidance you can provide!!!",

      "# [Cut the Chaos: Qualtrics Announces Top Employee Experience Trends for 2025 on 2024-10-17](https://www.qualtrics.com/news/cut-the-chaos-qualtrics-announces-top-employee-experience-trends-for-2025/)\nPROVO, Utah & SEATTLE, Oct. 17, 2024 – Today’s employees would like to get back on task. Years of chaotic workplace changes – think hybrid working arrangements and tracking multiple projects across different platforms have employees yearning for a simpler, productive 9-to-5, according to the sixth annual Employee Experience Trends Report from Qualtrics, drawing on insights from more than 35,000 employees in 23 countries around the world,\n\nThe five employee experience trends for 2025 are:\n\n+ 2025’s best employers will make work less chaotic: The pace of change is putting pressure on employees, and they need organizational support to stay engaged and maintain their well-being.\n\n+ Young employees are (surprisingly) optimistic…for now: Workers under 25 years old are highly engaged and have a positive outlook on the success of their company as well as their own careers.\n\n+ Employee experiences are being ruined by entry and exit: Employees rank the application and interview process as the worst part of the employee journey, risking company reputations.\n\n+ Prioritizing short-term gains are costing you long-term trust: While most employees believe in the competence and integrity of their senior leaders, just 56% believe they would prioritize employee well-being above short-term gains.\n\n+ PSA: Your people are outpacing you on AI: Only about half of employees say they have training and ethical guidelines around using AI at work.\n\n2025’s best employers will make work less chaotic\n\nAmid rapid change to the workplace, employees are more engaged when their employer’s culture and processes empower them and make it easier to do their jobs. A culture of continuous improvement is the strongest predictor of employee well-being, yet it’s trailing as one of the lowest rated metrics among global employees.\n\nNearly 40% of employees report feeling pressure to be more productive. The pressure primarily comes from trying to keep up with the pace of change, as well as the overall economic environment and strategic changes to the business. When employees feel pressure, they are less engaged and their well-being suffers.\n\nLeaders can ease this pressure by helping employees understand and adapt to changes – in fact, these are the top actions leaders can take to exceed employee expectations.\n\n“Over the past several years, we’ve seen that engagement and well-being are highest when employees feel proud of their organization’s impact on customers and supported in adapting to change.” said Dr. Benjamin Granger, Chief Workplace Psychologist at Qualtrics. “In general, humans are excellent at adapting to change, as long as they have support. Increased pressure to be productive must be met with increased organizational support and communication if organizations are to uphold their end of the new psychological contract between employee and employer.”\n\nYoung employees are (surprisingly) optimistic…for now\n\nWorkers under 25 are bringing highly engaged, optimistic energy to work. They want to drive change, and have an overall positive outlook on their company’s future, as well as their own.\n\nBut don’t count on them for the long run: The one metric where young workers trail older generations is their intent to stay with a company for three or more years, even when they feel their employer exceeds their expectations.\n\nSome of this could be due to typical demographic patterns. Young people may be more flexible about making major life changes more frequently. Still, leaders who want to retain this bright and valuable cohort can prioritize these things:\n\nTop drivers of intent to stay for employees 18-24 years old:\n\n+ My career goals can be met at this company\n\n+ Employee benefits meets my needs\n\n+ Manager behavior consistent with company values\n\n+ Believe in the company values\n\n+ Have meaningful career development discussions with my manager\n\n“When leaders accept stereotypes about young employees being lazy, entitled, or disengaged, they do their organizations a disservice. Crushing the optimism young workers bring into the workplace is far from productive, especially when it can be easily nurtured, bringing out creativity and new ideas for innovation,” according to Granger. “Offering them opportunities to share their ideas and stretch their skills can win over talented workers early in their careers and create lasting goodwill toward the company, even after they eventually depart.”\n\nEmployee experiences are being ruined by entry and exit\n\nEmployees who have been with their current company for less than six months don’t plan to stay long-term. More than half of these new employees (56%) plan to leave within three years, compared with just 34% of more tenured workers. Why? Because companies are souring their new employees’ morale before they even start by providing poor job candidate experience. In fact, the candidate experience is rated lowest among several significant phases in the employee journey, such as onboarding, changing roles or applying for a promotion.\n\nAt the other end of an employee’s time with a company, the exit experience was also poor. While departed employees are no longer active with a company, their final impression can become the lens through which they view their entire experience.\n\n“Potential and past employees are often overlooked when it comes to a company’s reputation, and organizations take on unnecessary risk by neglecting to address these bookend experiences,” said Granger. “Candidates and former employees can still influence others’ opinions about the company, good or bad. Organizations that invest in these first and final impressions gain a significant advantage in attracting talented candidates in the future, some of whom return to the company with enhanced skills and experiences.”\n\nPrioritizing short-term gains are costing you long-term trust\n\nMore than two-thirds of employees believe their senior leaders are both competent and act consistently with the organization’s values, but only 56% believe they will choose employee well-being over short-term gains.\n\nBusiness leaders are challenged by an uneven global economy and declining customer loyalty, but the long-term success of the company is at risk if they overlook the importance of employee trust.\n\n“Trust is the glue that holds people within organizations together, but it is often harder to earn and maintain during times of disruption and uncertainty,” said Granger. “Most leaders are comfortable tracking operational metrics, but the ones who earn employee trust go further to monitor how employees feel, and double down on trust building-behavior and communication during challenging times.”\n\nTrust is highly correlated with employee engagement, as well as employees’ sense of inclusion and well-being. Employees who trust their leaders are more open to changes, receptive to communication and overall act in ways that ultimately benefit the organization.\n\nEmployees are more likely to trust their leaders when:\n\n+ Senior leadership responds to feedback from employees\n\n+ Senior leadership values diverse perspectives, even if different\n\n+ There is open and honest communication at this company\n\n+ Work processes allow employees to be as productive as possible\n\n+ Company continually improves how work gets done\n\nPSA: Your people are outpacing you on AI\n\nEmployees are outpacing their employers on AI adoption, as enablement lags. Nearly half of employees say their organizations don’t provide AI enablement and training, and a similar share say their company has no clear AI guidelines, ethics or principles – or they are unaware they exist.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly a third of employees who use AI at work are using tools that they found themselves, as opposed to tools provided by the company, meaning they likely have not been approved by IT or security teams and may not have safeguards to protect company or customer data. Nearly half (45%) of employees say they are using AI daily or weekly, and employees who use AI regularly are more positive about its potential for their job than employees who rarely use it.\n\n“There’s a growing desire and readiness among workers to leverage AI, even if it isn’t explicitly supported by the company,” said Granger. “This introduces significant risks to employees, customers, and organizations alike. Many workers are already looking for opportunities to use AI to augment their work and it is far better for organizational leaders to lean in and provide approved tools and clear guidance to gain the benefits of these technologies without putting the company or customers at risk.”\n\nFor the full report and methodology, click here.\n\nAbout Qualtrics\n\nQualtrics, the leader of the experience management category, is a cloud-native software platform that empowers organizations to deliver exceptional experiences and build deep relationships with their customers and employees.

The partnership will help organizations more deeply understand relationships between quality, safety, and patient experiences.\n\nThis collaboration will move beyond traditional siloed measurement, combining key metrics and benchmarks Vizient and Qualtrics measure in order to drive meaningful improvements in patient outcomes and operational efficiency.\n\nUniversity of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann Health System, and Stanford Health Care—leaders in both clinical care and patient experience— participated in a pilot analysis for this groundbreaking initiative. The results of an initial analysis, presented this week at the Vizient Connections Summit, linked patient experience metrics such as clearer medical provider communication to important clinical outcomes, like emergency room visits, complications, and readmissions.\n\n\"Quality and patient experience are interrelated, but data is not easy to analyze at the patient level. By bringing quality, safety, and experience data together, we believe we can unlock the most impactful drivers of healthcare performance across multiple domains and the relationships between them,\" said David Levine, MD, FACEP, Chief Medical Officer for Vizient. \"This level of depth in insights has not been achieved in healthcare to date given siloed datasets and limited analytics.\"\n\n\"The initial analysis confirms so much of what we all believe: that the perception of experience is significantly related to clinical outcomes,\" said Dr. Adrienne Boissy, Chief Medical Officer, Qualtrics. \"But the thoughtful rigor of this work and the near term potential to focus improvement efforts of hardworking teams, prioritize interventions, and demonstrate value in dollars and operational gains is even more compelling.\"\n\nA New Era of Healthcare Performance Measurement\n\nHistorically, healthcare organizations have relied on siloed, retrospective data to measure performance and patient satisfaction. This new partnership between Vizient and Qualtrics will introduce a dynamic, forward-looking approach, allowing healthcare organizations to proactively manage performance and address clinical challenges before they manifest in performance data and drive continuous improvement with dynamic, actionable metrics that evolve with changing patient expectations and clinical environments.\n\nIdeal outcomes of the collaboration include:\n\nAnticipate Patient Outcomes: Harness patient feedback to predict clinical and operational outcomes, such as readmission rates, length of stay, and adverse clinical outcomes.\n\nClose the Gap Between Experience and Performance: Identify correlations between patient and clinical outcomes, providing healthcare leaders with the insights needed to address care gaps before they impact performance.\n\nDevelop Modern Experience Measurement: Define key elements of modern patient experience measurement that reflect real time performance, patient reported outcomes, and align to patient centered principles.\n\nFoundational Analyses with Leading Health Systems\n\nAn initial analysis of clinical and patient experience data from mutual clients University of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann Health System, and Stanford Health Care demonstrates the power of patient experience to drive better healthcare outcomes.\n\nKey findings included:\n\nPatients having a positive perception of communication with their caregivers was significantly associated with reductions in length of stay, 30-day readmissions, and emergency room visits.\n\nAmong inpatients with limited healthcare access, those who did not feel that their preferences were considered in their discharge plan were more likely to visit the emergency department within 30 days.\n\nBetter provider explanations could help mitigate the impact of adverse clinical events. Patients who rated provider explanations negatively exhibited significantly worse overall patient satisfaction when complications occurred, an effect that reversed when patients positively rated provider explanations.\n\nParticipating hospital leaders praised the collaboration and the insights delivered in the pilot.\n\n\"The combined analytics power of Qualtrics and Vizient allows us to break down data silos and gain actionable insights that directly enhance patient care,\" said Dan Lundergan, CEO at University of Utah Health Hospitals and Clinics. \"By understanding the connections between quality measures and patient experiences, we are better equipped to deliver high-value, patient-centered healthcare.\"\n\n\"This collaboration is a transformative step forward for health care. The ability to integrate and analyze diverse data sets in meaningful ways will power even more focused improvement efforts, ultimately fulfilling our commitment to creating more value for patients and populations,\" said Memorial Hermann Health System COO, Erin Asprec.\n\n\"We're excited to participate in this innovative collaboration with Qualtrics and Vizient,\" said David Entwistle, President and CEO of Stanford Health Care. \"By leveraging comprehensive data analysis, we can redefine patient experience and operational excellence, ensuring that every decision we make is closely aligned with our patients' needs and preferences.\"\n\nNext Steps and Industry-Wide Application\n\nOpportunities for other health systems to participate are expected to be rolled out following the completion of this initial phase with University of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann, and Stanford Health Care. The partnership will empower healthcare systems to take an innovative, data-driven approach to improving patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, positioning them for long-term success in an increasingly value-based care environment.\n\nAbout Vizient, Inc.\n\nVizient, Inc., the nation's largest provider-driven healthcare performance improvement company, serves more than 65% of the nation's acute care providers, including 97% of the nation's academic medical centers, and more than 35% of the non-acute market.

      "# [Powered Qualtrics Solutions Empower Leaders to Boost Employee Engagement With Strategic, Informed Action on 2024-10-30](https://www.qualtrics.com/news/new-ai-powered-qualtrics-solutions-empower-leaders-to-boost-employee-engagement-with-strategic-informed-action/)\nPROVO, Utah & SEATTLE, Oct. 30, 2024 – Qualtrics, the leader of the experience management (XM) category, today announced the general availability of new Qualtrics® AI capabilities in the XM for Employee Experience™ that will elevate organizations’ ability to collect and analyze complex employee feedback and turn those insights into recommendations and actions that improve employee engagement, satisfaction and productivity. New Qualtrics Assist for Employee Experience, Comment Summaries, and Conversational Feedback capabilities use employee feedback to create clear, practical recommendations that reduce bias, and improve manager and team effectiveness.\n\n“These new generative AI capabilities empower companies to harness AI’s potential in a safe and responsible way, ” said Wojtek Kubik, Head of Product, Employee Experience at Qualtrics. “Organizations can now extract insights faster through advanced summaries, interact seamlessly with data using a natural language copilot for deeper comprehension, and elicit more comprehensive team responses.”\n\nIn today’s hybrid and remote workplaces, managers need streamlined processes that help them lead their teams more effectively. A new Qualtrics study of over 35,000 employees worldwide showed that just half of all individual contributors believe their company has made positive changes based on their feedback. When employees don’t see any action taken on their feedback, they lose trust in the company.\n\nMany individual contributors report to first-time managers who struggle to interpret and take action on employee feedback results due to their lack of experience or technical skills. Complicated or lengthy team dashboards can obscure team sentiment and improvement opportunities, while a slow review process may lead to missed feedback and lingering unresolved issues.\n\nQualtrics Assist for Employee Experience enables people leaders across the organization to understand and act on employee feedback\n\nQualtrics Assist for Employee Experience is an AI-powered dashboard assistant that provides analysts, managers, and leaders with rapid insights regarding employee experience data, helping them focus on critical improvement areas. It allows managers and team leaders to explore their team’s data by asking simple questions such as “what conversations can I have in my next team meeting to help increase collaboration?” or “what are the most discussed topics from the open comments questions?” Guided prompts help managers explore and understand their data more thoroughly.\n\nQualtrics Assist identifies the most relevant employee engagement data and applies proprietary, science-backed industry benchmark data, methodologies, and best practices to transform complex data into clear and simple insights, recommendations, and suggested actions.\n\nadidas is recognized by Forbes as one of the world’s best employers and is leading globally by identifying and acting on the intrinsic link between employee experience and business outcomes. The company deepened its commitment to employee experience by embracing Qualtrics Assist for Employee Experience to empower managers at all levels to take effective action based on feedback.\n\n“We leveraged Qualtrics AI to democratize insights, reduce bias, and save time” says Dr. Sebastian Projahn, Senior Director of People Intelligence at adidas. “Managers, especially those in our stores and distribution centers where time is critical, can focus on driving impact, rather than interpreting data and reading multiple comments”.\n\nAI-generated Comment Summaries pinpoint unique team dynamics by analyzing open-text feedback\n\n“While personal comments from employees can be very insightful, going through all the feedback can be overwhelming for managers and team leaders.” said Wojtek Kubik, Head of Product, Employee Experience at Qualtrics. “This often leads to biased interpretations, where managers pay more attention to specific comments instead of looking for common themes in the team’s feedback.”\n\nQualtrics Comment Summaries uses Qualtrics proprietary AI to automatically aggregate and summarize employee feedback into clear themes that help managers quickly identify patterns and trends. These AI-generated summaries allow managers to analyze open-text feedback at scale without compromising employee anonymity.\n\nComment Summaries transform feedback into actionable insights, saving HR and leaders time while fostering trust and satisfaction in the workplace.\n\nAllstate faced challenges in analyzing employee feedback from open-text comments due to its large workforce. The time-consuming review process limited the number of surveys Allstate could conduct each year. To address this, Allstate implemented Qualtrics Comment Summaries, which offered a structured, automated, and unbiased way to categorize and summarize extensive feedback efficiently. Using the solution, Allstate was able to quickly identify overarching themes in employee feedback in hours, not weeks, and increase the frequency of survey touchpoints, allowing for a more continuous listening approach.\n\n“To turn something around within 48 hours, with our fresh data, for high-level executive board presentations is not something we’d been able to accomplish,” said Kiera Connerty, Global Employee Listening & Engagement Team Lead at Allstate. “We can now go beyond engagement and other scores, glean things employees are talking about, how they feel about them in such a short timeframe.”\n\nQualtrics Conversational Feedback empowers organizations get the most out of their employee surveys\n\nIncomplete or vague employee survey responses waste time and resources and make it difficult to uncover meaningful insights. Qualtrics Conversational Feedback uses Qualtrics AI to analyze survey responses to detect incomplete or vague answers and prompts respondents for additional details.\n\nIn a controlled study, survey respondents added additional information 40% of the time when prompted by Qualtrics AI, and the new responses were more comprehensive and descriptive, including nearly four times as many characters, covering a wider range of topics. Importantly, there was no change in dropout rates, or increase in perceived burden among the respondents.\n\nBy intelligently prompting respondents for additional detail, HR teams and managers can transform employee feedback into more actionable insights, enhancing the overall effectiveness of employee surveys.\n\nLearn more about Qualtrics AI for Employee Experience here\n\nAbout Qualtrics\n\nQualtrics, the leader of the experience management category, is a cloud-native software platform that empowers organizations to deliver exceptional experiences and build deep relationships with their customers and employees.

      "# [Healthcare Leaders Deliver Impact and Scale with Qualtrics on 2024-03-13](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/healthcare-leaders-deliver-impact-and-scale-with-qualtrics-302087772.html)\nPROVO, Utah and SEATTLE, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Healthcare leaders are continuing to partner with Qualtrics to make stressful and emotional care situations easier for their patients. Qualtrics helps healthcare organizations and healthcare providers better understand patient needs and respond to patients in the moment. In a recent Qualtrics report, consumers reported 16% of their recent experiences with hospitals and medical centers were very poor.\n\n\"We have made great strides to drive quality, safety and experience, but there is still work to be done to help people with empathy and humanity throughout the entirety of the healthcare experience,\" said Qualtrics Chief Medical Officer Dr. Adrienne Boissy. \"Working with electronic health records and organizations that are iterating and exploring new ways to listen and respond to make improvements - without burdening clinicians - gives me hope for the future of healthcare.\"\n\nHealthcare providers choose Qualtrics® to transform patient and provider experiences\n\nWakeMed Health & Hospitals, a not-for-profit health care system in Raleigh, N.C., is transforming from a system of measurement to a system of action by listening and responding. With Qualtrics, WakeMed will be collecting feedback across the continuum of care shortly after a visit. As a result, they will be gaining visibility into the patient journey in near real time. Any responses requiring action will immediately result in an assignment so patient feedback can be addressed in the moment. There are a multitude of touchpoints that affect how a patient views their overall healthcare experience, and a Qualtrics dashboard of the patient feedback data will give WakeMed actionable insights to make improvements at every stage in the patient's journey.\n\nNorthwell Health, the largest health system in the northeast, which operates 21 hospitals and nearly 900 outpatient facilities, selected Qualtrics to better gauge how patients connect with its Financial Services team and drive meaningful action based on that feedback. Each individual aspect of a patient's experience contributes to their overall perception of care received and the team at Northwell is on a mission to transform a historically viewed transaction like paying a bill into an experience differentiator. With a more holistic view of how patients and the Financial Services team interact, Northwell will be able to identify and resolve gaps, leverage feedback in real-time to coach team members, and help improve key performance indicators such as first call resolution of patient concerns.\n\nLeading organizations see improved results with insights from Qualtrics\n\nBon Secours Mercy Health, a leading Catholic healthcare system in the U.S. with 49 hospitals and more than 60,000 associates, utilizes the flexibility of the Qualtrics platform to combine experience data with data from multiple HR systems, enabling a holistic view of the associate experience. Bon Secours moved away from standard engagement surveys to a research-backed method of tracking experiences and metrics linked to desired outcomes, such as loyalty and well-being. By listening and acting on feedback, Bon Secours made improvements to benefits that resulted in a 5% reduction in turnover among registered nurses and 5% improvement in overall employee intent to stay.\n\nCHRISTUS Health, a health system with more than 600 centers, is now able to assess the overall experience of their patients. Through Qualtrics' Closed Loop Ticketing system, CHRISTUS is following up with dissatisfied patients to address individual needs and identify common challenges across 230 medical practice sites, closing an average of 80 tickets per day. In measuring the impact of this program, CHRISTUS saw a three-point increase in likelihood to recommend scores among patients who received follow-up and enthusiasm from caregivers about in-the-moment fixes they could make.\n\nUniversity of Utah Health, which provides medical care, education and research across six states, implemented Qualtrics solutions to get patient feedback into the hands of providers and staff who can make a difference for a patient in the moment. Their focus is on making it easier for patients, but also making it easier for employees to do the right thing. With digital feedback technology in some patient rooms and a 100% increase in patient comments, U of U Health is scaling individual insights to transform its overall patient experience program, creating a continuous cycle of improvement.\n\nA new integration between Qualtrics and Epic will integrate Qualtrics patient experience insights with clinical and operational data. Epic is the largest provider of electronic health records for medical organizations in the US, including payers and retail pharmacies. Patients are bringing expectations from other industries into their interactions with healthcare, and the Epic-Qualtrics integration will help providers meet and exceed those expectations.\n\nFor more information, visit www.qualtrics.com/healthcare.\n\nAbout Qualtrics XM® for Healthcare\n\nQualtrics helps healthcare and life sciences organizations design experiences that improve satisfaction, loyalty and trust.

      "# [Powered Innovations to Elevate CX on 2024-05-01](https://www.qualtrics.com/news/qualtrics-ai-empowers-organizations-to-improve-customer-experiences-in-store-online-and-in-the-call-center/)\nQUALTRICS X4, SALT LAKE CITY, May 1, 2024 – Qualtrics, the leader and creator of the experience management category, today unveiled new AI-powered innovations across XM for Customer Experience™ empowering organizations to understand and build connections at scale, with every customer, and personalize the customer experience at speed and scale across every channel.\n\nThese new solutions, powered by Qualtrics® AI, create an empathetic, humanized experience by helping organizations understand the sentiment, satisfaction, effort, expectations and preferences for every customer. This leads to strong customer loyalty that accelerates revenue growth and reduces operating costs.\n\nResearch from Qualtrics and ServiceNow revealed 80% of customers said they have switched brands because of poor customer experience, and 43% of respondents said they were at least somewhat likely to switch brands after only a single negative customer service interaction. However, since 2021, the share of consumers providing feedback directly to the companies they buy from following a very bad experience has fallen by 7.2 percentage points.\n\nQualtrics empowers every organization to understand what’s going on at every stage of the customer journey, at every frontline touchpoint, without ever having to ask.\n\n“Fueled by our $500 million commitment to AI innovation, Qualtrics is making it easier than ever for customer experience teams to rapidly and meaningfully deliver the superior, personal, and human experiences their customers are looking for,” said Brad Anderson, President of Product, UX and Engineering at Qualtrics. “With these new purpose-built AI capabilities, Qualtrics is at the forefront of an exciting new age of experience management, giving organizations, including Hilton and Motorola Solutions, the power to improve every experience in the moment, across every channel that matters.”\n\nQualtrics AI and Qualtrics Frontline Locations™ allow frontline teams to connect with every customer in every location\n\nThe impact of consumers’ online reviews and comments on a business is huge – over two-thirds of consumers look at reviews before buying from a new brand. Responding to detractors can soften the impact of a negative review, but companies with multiple locations often struggle to capture and analyze the location-level insights necessary to tailor responses across all their online channels.\n\nNew AI-powered capabilities from Qualtrics help frontline teams – in-store and online – personalize the customer experience and remove points of friction across channels by listening to customer feedback across all channels (e.g., voice calls, chats, social reviews, ratings, surveys):\n\n● Frontline Locations Assist is an intuitive, purpose-built insights hub that analyzes every piece of customer feedback – including feedback from surveys, within the app, the contact center, online, and reviews – to equip frontline managers with actionable insights and recommended steps they should take to improve their customer experience and drive business value, such as replying to customer reviews, checking in on open tickets, and rewarding employees.\n\n● New AI-powered review and ticket response suggestions enable frontline teams to quickly resolve issues with automatically generated, personalized and appropriately tuned responses. This speeds up ticket resolution and online review response times, helping organizations exceed customer expectations for support, build stronger relationships and increase customer loyalty.\n\nWith Qualtrics AI-enabled capabilities, Hilton is now collecting and synthesizing feedback across the entire guest journey for its more than 7,600 global properties, including calls, chatbot interactions, email and messaging during and after a guest’s stay, in-app, and from digital surveys. Guest insights inform every aspect of the company’s commercial strategy, and in 2023, Hilton served hundreds of millions of guests and achieved record financial results.\n\nQualtrics AI-powered Frontline Digital™ solutions pinpoint, diagnose, & help prioritize broken digital experiences\n\nGreat online experiences are essential to attracting and retaining customers, but a recent Qualtrics study found that consumers feel businesses frequently fall short, failing to deliver a humanized, personalized digital experience. Frustrated users are more likely than satisfied users to leave the website and not complete desired actions, leading to costly support calls, and potentially lost customers. However, businesses often struggle to understand customer pain points or measure how frustrating online experiences affect conversion rates.\n\nQualtrics Digital Experience Analytics, powered by Qualtrics AI, continues to evolve with Digital Assist, a purpose-built digital insights hub made specifically for improving digital experiences:\n\n● New heatmap capabilities help digital and UX teams quickly identify and resolve web technical, design and product issues through a visual diagram of customer interactions with a company’s websites. Heatmaps are compiled using millions of clicks, scrolls and mouse movements to demonstrate on-page behavior and identify hotspots of user activity.\n\n● New funnel analytics enable businesses to identify major drop-off points along the web customer journey and understand why customers are failing to complete their tasks by combining experience data with behavioral clues, such as mouse thrashes, to fix problems quickly and efficiently.\n\n● New real-time frustration intercepting capabilities enable businesses to identify customers experiencing challenges online in real time and offer targeted support in the moment.\n\nCompanies can combine digital customer experience insights with other data sources – including profiles in Qualtrics Experience iD™, sentiment data from surveys, session replays, or operational data like purchase history – in Digital Experience Analytics to create a complete view of their customer experience. Qualtrics Frontline Digital and Frontline Care work together to uncover services calls specifically correlated with lack of information on digital channels and suggest actions to deflect those calls to self-service options, lowering operating costs in the service center.\n\nFor Motorola Solutions, a global leader in safety and security technologies, enhancing its global digital experiences is a priority. Using the digital solutions within Qualtrics XM for Customer Experience™ suite, Motorola Solutions is optimizing its web and eCommerce experiences to drive stronger web traffic and conversion rates while improving its customers’ overall satisfaction.\n\nQualtrics Frontline Care™ enables agents to build deeper human connections with AI\n\nNew real-time agent productivity solutions powered by Qualtrics AI help frontline agents resolve customer issues with empathy at speed and scale.\n\n● Customer Care Assist is a purpose-built app for aggregating insights & workflows across the customer care experience. Managers can generate personalized coaching plans based on each individual agent’s strengths and weaknesses, reducing time spent reviewing dashboards and listening to calls. Many contact center quality assurance (QA) practices today are costly, manual, slow, and biased, typically relying on a QA manager reviewing only three to five calls per week, per agent. Qualtrics AI automatically evaluates every call to identify attributes such as problem resolution, friendliness and compliance, to surface where teams may need additional coaching, improving customer service while saving time and money.\n\n● Qualtrics Automated Call Summaries uses Qualtrics AI to automatically summarize customer feedback, enabling frontline teams to instantly generate support tickets, send personalized follow-up emails, and create knowledge based articles using real-time information about customer issues and historical, personalized customer data from XiD.\n\nAdditional Information\n\n● Qualtrics Frontline Location Assist is available in private preview.\n\n● Qualtrics new Digital Experience Analytics capabilities are available in private preview.\n\n● Qualtrics Customer Care Assist is in private preview and Automated Call Summaries is generally available today.\n\n● You can learn more about Qualtrics XM for Customer Experience here.\n\nAbout Qualtrics\n\nQualtrics, the leader and creator of the experience management category, is a cloud-native software platform that empowers organizations to deliver exceptional experiences and build deep relationships with their customers and employees.

      "# [No Jitter Roll: Another Slew of Gen AI-related News from AWS, RingCentral, Qualtrics and Avaamo by Matt Vartabedian on 2024-05-03](https://www.nojitter.com/ai-automation/no-jitter-roll-another-slew-gen-ai-related-news-aws-ringcentral-qualtrics-and-avaamo)\nWelcome to this week’s No Jitter Roll, our regular roundup of product news in the communication and collaboration spaces. Leading off this week, we highlight: The general availability of Amazon Q from AWS; a new generative AI feature in Amazon Connect's Contact Lens; Talkmap's Gen AI updates to its TalkDiscovery platform; new APIs from RingCentral for AI, video and social media, as well as a workflow builder.\n\nAlso, Qualtrics launched several CX-specific solutions based on its Qualtrics AI Assist product; Avaamo launched an agent assist product for the contact center; and, SymphonyAI debuted a Gen AI copilot targeted at employees and IT staff.\n\nLastly, in the one piece of non-AI news, Calendly introduced a new Web browser extension that helps streamline meeting workflows.\n\nAmazon Q from AWS Becomes Generally Available\n\nAnnounced in late 2023, Amazon Q is now generally available. Amazon Q is a generative AI-based assistant. It is available in two broad categories: Developer and Business.\n\nAmazon Q Business\n\nAmazon Q Business can answer questions, provide summaries, generate content, and securely complete tasks based on data and information in enterprise systems. Q Business:\n\nConnects to 40+ business tools, such as wikis, intranets, Atlassian, Gmail, Microsoft Exchange, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Slack, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Q can be “pointed” at those repositories for data analysis and interaction.\n\nIntegrates with a customer’s existing identities, roles, and access permissions to personalize the interactions for each individual user. Customers can restrict sensitive topics, block keywords, and filter out inappropriate content. As with Q Developer, Q Business also does not use customer content to train the underlying models for anybody else.\n\nCreates business insight dashboards using natural language thanks to integration with Amazon QuickSight, AWS’s unified Business Intelligence (BI) service. Users can also ask questions of data beyond what is presented in the dashboards. Users can the choose to layout the content produced by Q in a document or presentation where they can customize text, images, and themes, and use Amazon Q to rewrite and improve the text.\n\nAmazon Q Developer\n\nAmazon Q Developer assists developers and other IT professionals in several ways. First, Q will generate code suggestions and recommendations in near real time while developers are coding. Customizations are private and the underlying foundation model does not use them for training.\n\nAWS noted that one of its customers, BT Group, said it accepted 37% of Q’s code suggestions while another, National Australia Bank reported 50% acceptance rates. Q can leverage a customer’s internal code base to provide more relevant and useful code recommendations.\n\nQ has another capability, called agents, which can autonomously perform various tasks, such as implementing features, documenting and refactoring code, or performing software upgrades. For example, a human developer can ask the agent to implement an application feature and the agent will then analyze existing application code and generate a step-by-step implementation plan. The human can then review and iterate on that plan before the agent implements.Lastly, Q Developer can scan code for vulnerabilities and suggest remediations. It will also help IT professional optimize and troubleshoot their AWS environment.\n\nWant to know more?\n\nCheck out analyst Sheila McGee-Smith’s thoughts on what Amazon Q brings to Amazon Connect (published in December 2023).\n\nAmazon Connect Contact Lens To Provide Gen AI-powered Agent Performance Evaluations\n\nAt Amazon Connect’s Contact Center Day, AWS announced a new generative AI feature in preview in Amazon Connect Contact Lens. The new feature provides managers with generative AI-powered recommendations for answers to questions in agent evaluation forms. Managers receive additional agent behavioral insights (e.g., did the agent show empathy while delivering bad news?) and will get context and justification for the recommended answers (i.e., reference points from the transcript that were used to provide answers).\n\nThese gen AI-powered recommendations are built using Amazon Bedrock and are available in the US West (Oregon) and US East (North Virginia) regions in the English language. During preview, this feature is included with Contact Lens performance evaluations at no additional charge. To learn more, visit Amazon Connect’s documentation and webpage.\n\nTalkmap Unveils TalkDiscovery Version 8.3\n\nThe provider of generative AI-powered contact center solutions announced version 8.3 of its TalkDiscovery platform. The new release introduces two new generative AI platform features: Conversation Summaries and Contact Intents. Contact Intents is a standalone data attribute that is generated for each conversation. It identifies the customer’s “main reason” why they contacted the contact center. Note that this is in addition to the platform recording all turn-level customer intents. Conversation Summaries have been supported by TalkDiscovery for several years; this new version is a revamped approach to generating those summaries.\n\nRingCentral Launches RingSense AI APIs and Workflow Builder\n\nThe AI-driven UCaaS, CCaaS, video and hybrid event solution provider made several announcements, including new RingSense AI APIS with which customers can generate audio and video transcriptions, summarizations, and speaker diarization (attributing audio segments within a recording to individual speakers) across RingCentral and third-party generated recordings.\n\nRingCentral’s new video APIs and SDK will allow developers to integrate live video meetings and interactions into their applications through a white-labeled experience with built-in customizability, closed captioning, and chat. With the social messaging APIs, can integrate with nine different social media platforms (all the major ones). These new APIs are available in beta to RingCentral Video Pro+ and RingEX customers, free of charge.\n\nThe new RingCentral Workflow Builder allows customers to create workflows from pre-built or custom templates. The pre-built templates include automatic, canned responses for out-of-office replies, SMS keyword autoreplies, voicemail received notifications via SMS and after-hours SMS autoreplies. These new capabilities can handle more complex triggers, for example creating automated, personalized responses to an exact phone number match of an incoming SMS message or transcribing a voicemail to trigger actions based on its content.\n\nQualtrics AI to Improve CX In-Store, Online, and in the Call Center\n\nThe experience management solution provider announced its Qualtrics AI-powered Frontline Locations, Frontline Digital and Frontline Care solutions. Underlying these several CX related solutions is Qualtrics AI Assist, a platform-wide Gen AI agent that allows users to ask natural language questions about data and receive a response based on a company’s own data. Qualtrics AI Assist can generate summaries and trigger workflows.\n\nQualtrics Frontline Locations Assist is a hub that analyzes customer feedback – from surveys, within apps, the contact center, online, and reviews – to provide frontline managers with insights and recommended steps to improve customer experience.\n\nThe Qualtrics AI-powered Frontline Digital solution provides similar insights but for a Web site, such as heatmaps, funnel analytics and real-time frustration ‘interception’ which enables business to identify customers experiencing challenges with the company’s site in real time and offer targeted support in the moment.\n\nQualtrics Frontline Care includes Customer Care Assist, which aggregates insights and workflows across the customer care experience which a manager could use to generate per-agent coaching plans. It also uses Qualtrics AI to automatically summarize customer feedback which frontline teams can use to generate support tickets, send follow-up emails and/or create knowledge base articles.\n\nQualtrics Frontline Location Assist is available in private preview, as are the Digital solutions. Qualtrics Customer Care Assist is in private preview and Automated Call Summaries is generally available today.\n\nAvaamo Launches AI-Powered Agent Assist Copilot\n\nThe autonomous agent platform provider for customer service operations launched its Avaamo Agent Assist Copilot which uses generative AI throughout the call to:\n\nRoute calls based on caller intent to the agents best suited to handle those types of calls while also mining relevant CRM data, previous requests, historical interactions, etc.\n\nProvide agent assistance during the call based on what the customer is saying. This assistance draws on unique customer data, public information, standard operating procedure (SOP) documents, and more. The copilot will also recommend a “next best action” and via robotic process automation (RPA) integration with backends systems, the copilot can also automate some tasks.\n\nAssign tags, extract topics, track promises made to customers, and update customer records during the call and after the interaction completes.\n\nAgent Assist Copilot joins Avaamo’s Suite of Generative AI tools, including LLaMB, Avaamo IVA, Avaamo Outreach, and Avaamo Live Agent.\n\nSymphonyAI Launches Generative AI-based Apex Enterprise IT Copilot\n\nThe predictive and generative enterprise AI SaaS provider unveiled Apex Enterprise IT Copilot, a generative AI-based assistant for end users, IT analysts and executives. Depending on the type of end user, the copilot will provide self-serve assistance via knowledge articles, work prioritization, insights around trends, and more. The copilot is part of SymphonyAI Apex, a predictive and generative AI-based IT service management/enterprise service management platform. The copilot and Apex are powered by SymphonyAI’s Eureka Gen AI platform.\n\nCalendly Delivers New Web Browser Extension for Meeting Workflows\n\nThe centralized scheduling automation platform announced a new Calendly web browser extension for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, and a similar add-in for Outlook. Via a new meetings tab (pictured below), users can see all meetings in one place, view contact details and meeting history, schedule meetings on behalf of a team member, and book meetings from the extension without task- or app-switching.

      "# [Research: As AI Increases in the Workplace, Employees Are Open to Their Employers Listening on 2024-08-22](https://www.qualtrics.com/news/research-as-ai-increases-in-the-workplace-employees-are-open-to-their-employers-listening/)\nPROVO, Utah & SEATTLE, August 22, 2024 – Most employees are open to having their organizations analyze data from emails, messages and meetings to improve their employee experience, according to new Qualtrics research. Also known as passive listening, this practice provides valuable insights using data employees generate in their daily activities. In fact, only 27% of employees said they definitely or probably would not opt in to a program that analyzed text data from sources like work emails or instant messages to improve their experiences at work.\n\nEmployees’ self-reported comfort with their organization analyzing different data sources is significantly higher than what HR leaders predicted. The biggest difference is in direct messages; HR underestimated employee comfort by 16 percentage points.\n\nThe expansion of AI is increasing data collection and analysis by organizations trying to reign in expensive attrition. Employees generate valuable data in the course of their daily work, such as emails, Slack messages, IT tickets, and meeting invitations. AI can parse this data to reveal patterns that predict things like disengagement or burnout and allow employers to step in, especially as the volume of data increases.\n\n“This research underscores the crucial dialogue needed between employers and employees in the evolving landscape of today’s workplace,” said Dr. Benjamin Granger, Chief Workplace Psychologist at Qualtrics. “Good dialogue is two-way and employees appreciate opportunities to drive the conversation with senior leadership. Passive listening allows employees to raise topics that don’t show up in employee surveys and open up new lines of communication.”\n\nOther key findings of the research include:\n\nLower-level employees are much more wary about their organization analyzing their data than senior leaders, reflecting findings from Qualtrics’ 2024 Employee Experience Trends Report.\n\nJust 27% of individual contributors say they probably or definitely would opt in to a passive listening program, compared with 71% of C-suite leaders. This disparity in embracing new technology supports previous Qualtrics research that found executives were excited about the potential impact of AI while individual contributors were more likely to call it scary.\n\nEmployees are more comfortable with analysis of their emails and messages than social media.\n\nAmong text-based channels, they are most comfortable with work system processes like IT tickets, open-text survey responses and meeting transcripts being used. Employees are less comfortable with more personal data sources like email and Slack messages being analyzed, and least comfortable with their organization analyzing social media, even if it is anonymous.\n\nThe biggest concern employees have about passive listening is an invasion of privacy, followed by data security and the data being misinterpreted.\n\nFor employees who would not opt in to a passive listening program, transparency about how the data is used–or not used–and who had access to it, as well as control over opting out in the future are the top ways to change their minds.\n\nCompanies must build trust before introducing passive employee listening programs\n\nEmployees who trust senior leadership at their organization are significantly more willing to participate in a passive listening program than those who don’t trust their leaders. More than half (55%) of employees who trust senior leadership said they would probably or definitely share their data. If employees do not trust their senior leaders, the reverse is true – 53% said they probably or definitely would not choose to share their data.\n\n“Trust is foundational in developing a mutually beneficial relationship between employees and organizational leaders,” said Granger. “This is especially true when it comes to introducing new programs and technologies. Leaders can build trust by highlighting how individual employees will benefit and providing ongoing transparency and autonomy over their data.”\n\nEmployees are more comfortable with passive listening than HR leaders expect\n\n“In their laudable desire to protect employee privacy, HR leaders may be underestimating employee comfort with passive listening,” said Matt Evans, head of employee experience product science at Qualtrics. “When organizations highlight the benefits and address concerns, they will drive higher acceptance and gain valuable insights into what is top of mind for employees.”\n\nLearn more here.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis research was conducted in March 2024 among 1,000 desk-based workers and 100 HR leaders in Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. Respondents were selected from a randomized panel and considered eligible if they are at least 18 years of age.\n\nAbout Qualtrics\n\nQualtrics, the leader and creator of the experience management category, is a cloud-native software platform that empowers organizations to deliver exceptional experiences and build deep relationships with their customers and employees. With insights from Qualtrics, organizations can identify and resolve the greatest friction points in their business, retain and engage top talent, and bring the right products and services to market.

      "# [Vizient and Qualtrics Announce Strategic Partnership to Develop Predictive Experience Metrics to Revolutionize Healthcare Performance](https://www.vizientinc.com/newsroom/news-releases/2024/vizient-and-qualtrics-announce-strategic-partnership-to-develop-predictive-experience-metrics)\nQualtrics and Vizient combine quality and patient experience data from leading hospitals, showing a tie between patient experience and clinical outcomes\n\nInnovative partnership will empower healthcare organizations with holistic, actionable insights that will transform the way healthcare organizations measure and improve performance by using groundbreaking research-backed predictive experience models\n\nIRVING, Texas and PROVO, Utah, Sept. 17, 2024 — Vizient, Inc. the nation's largest healthcare performance improvement company, and Qualtrics, the leader and creator of the experience management category, today announced an innovative strategic partnership to employ experience metrics to transform the way healthcare organizations measure and improve performance. The partnership will help organizations more deeply understand relationships between quality, safety, and patient experiences.\n\nThis collaboration will move beyond traditional siloed measurement, combining key metrics and benchmarks Vizient and Qualtrics measure in order to drive meaningful improvements in patient outcomes and operational efficiency.\n\nUniversity of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann Health System, and Stanford Health Care—leaders in both clinical care and patient experience— participated in a pilot analysis for this groundbreaking initiative. The results of an initial analysis, presented this week at the Vizient Connections Summit, linked patient experience metrics such as clearer medical provider communication to important clinical outcomes, like emergency room visits, complications, and readmissions.\n\n\"Quality and patient experience are interrelated, but data is not easy to analyze at the patient level. By bringing quality, safety, and experience data together, we believe we can unlock the most impactful drivers of healthcare performance across multiple domains and the relationships between them,\" said David Levine, MD, FACEP, Chief Medical Officer for Vizient. \"This level of depth in insights has not been achieved in healthcare to date given siloed datasets and limited analytics.\"\n\n\"The initial analysis confirms so much of what we all believe: that the perception of experience is significantly related to clinical outcomes,\" said Dr. Adrienne Boissy, Chief Medical Officer, Qualtrics. \"But the thoughtful rigor of this work and the near term potential to focus improvement efforts of hardworking teams, prioritize interventions, and demonstrate value in dollars and operational gains is even more compelling.\"\n\nA New Era of Healthcare Performance Measurement\n\nHistorically, healthcare organizations have relied on siloed, retrospective data to measure performance and patient satisfaction. This new partnership between Vizient and Qualtrics will introduce a dynamic, forward-looking approach, allowing healthcare organizations to proactively manage performance and address clinical challenges before they manifest in performance data and drive continuous improvement with dynamic, actionable metrics that evolve with changing patient expectations and clinical environments.\n\nIdeal outcomes of the collaboration include:\n\nAnticipate Patient Outcomes: Harness patient feedback to predict clinical and operational outcomes, such as readmission rates, length of stay, and adverse clinical outcomes.;\n\nClose the Gap Between Experience and Performance: Identify correlations between patient and clinical outcomes, providing healthcare leaders with the insights needed to address care gaps before they impact performance.\n\nDevelop Modern Experience Measurement: Define key elements of modern patient experience measurement that reflect real time performance, patient reported outcomes, and align to patient centered principles.\n\nFoundational Analyses with Leading Health Systems\n\nAn initial analysis of clinical and patient experience data from mutual clients University of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann Health System, and Stanford Health Care demonstrates the power of patient experience to drive better healthcare outcomes.\n\nKey findings included:\n\nPatients having a positive perception of communication with their caregivers was significantly associated with reductions in length of stay, 30-day readmissions, and emergency room visits.\n\nAmong inpatients with limited healthcare access, those who did not feel that their preferences were considered in their discharge plan were more likely to visit the emergency department within 30 days.\n\nBetter provider explanations could help mitigate the impact of adverse clinical events. Patients who rated provider explanations negatively exhibited significantly worse overall patient satisfaction when complications occurred, an effect that reversed when patients positively rated provider explanations.\n\nParticipating hospital leaders praised the collaboration and the insights delivered in the pilot.\n\n\"The combined analytics power of Qualtrics and Vizient allows us to break down data silos and gain actionable insights that directly enhance patient care,\" said Dan Lundergan, CEO at University of Utah Health Hospitals and Clinics. \"By understanding the connections between quality measures and patient experiences, we are better equipped to deliver high-value, patient-centered healthcare.\"\n\n\"This collaboration is a transformative step forward for health care. The ability to integrate and analyze diverse data sets in meaningful ways will power even more focused improvement efforts, ultimately fulfilling our commitment to creating more value for patients and populations,\" said Memorial Hermann Health System COO, Erin Asprec.\n\n\"We're excited to participate in this innovative collaboration with Qualtrics and Vizient,\" said David Entwistle, President and CEO of Stanford Health Care. \"By leveraging comprehensive data analysis, we can redefine patient experience and operational excellence, ensuring that every decision we make is closely aligned with our patients' needs and preferences.\"\n\nNext Steps and Industry-Wide Application\n\nOpportunities for other health systems to participate are expected to be rolled out following the completion of this initial phase with University of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann, and Stanford Health Care. The partnership will empower healthcare systems to take an innovative, data-driven approach to improving patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, positioning them for long-term success in an increasingly value-based care environment.\n\nAbout Vizient, Inc.\n\nVizient, Inc., the nation's largest provider-driven healthcare performance improvement company, serves more than 65% of the nation's acute care providers, including 97% of the nation's academic medical centers, and more than 35% of the non-acute market.

      "# [Lumen and Qualtrics Build New Customer Insights Platform to Boost Customer Service and Satisfaction on 2024-10-01](https://www.qualtrics.com/news/lumen-and-qualtrics-build-new-customer-insights-platform-to-boost-customer-service-and-satisfaction/)\nPROVO, Utah & SEATTLE (Oct. 1, 2024) – Qualtrics, the leader and creator of the experience management (XM) category, expanded on its partnership with Lumen, a global enterprise technology platform and telecommunications company, to redesign Lumen’s customer and employee experience programs and improve the service it provides to customers.\n\nPowered by Qualtrics XM® for Customer Experience suite and Qualtrics AI, the new Lumen real-time customer insights platform combines feedback from more than two dozen sources, including customer interactions, service performance, and market-specific trends in unstructured feedback like social media or call center transcripts.\n\nThese real-time insights into customer and employee experience performance allow Lumen to tailor its communication with every customer based on their specific needs and recent experiences. For example, call-center agents assisting a customer can see a Customer Health Score that fluctuates daily based on real-time operational inputs. The added insights enable agents to communicate with greater relevance, as well as empathy.\n\nAs a result of its partnership with Qualtrics, Lumen achieved a 17-point year-over-year increase in NPS, indicating substantial gains in customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\n“Real-time data signals mean that our people can meet the moment and engage customers with empathy,” said Kristina Nissen, Senior Vice President, Strategic Pursuits and Mid-Market at Lumen Technologies. “Our new customer health scores powered by Qualtrics provide our people with a more comprehensive understanding of how to help each customer as an individual and which actions they can take to make the biggest impact on their experience.”\n\nContextual insights fuel smarter communications\n\nOver a decade of research by the Qualtrics XM Institute demonstrates that how customers feel about an experience has the most significant impact on their future loyalty behaviors compared to other factors. Thanks to its longstanding partnership with Qualtrics, Lumen already had a wealth of experiential data showing how customers felt about their interactions with the company. But that data was missing operational context; for example, Lumen couldn’t tell whether an unhappy customer was offering feedback right after a technician missed a service appointment.\n\nLumen tapped into Qualtrics AI and natural language processing capabilities to build a comprehensive real-time customer insights platform that combines data from dozens of sources, including unstructured, unsolicited feedback that already exists in places like online forums, review sites, social media platforms, and chat or phone conversations as well as operational metrics like on time service delivery. That fusion of experiential and operational data enables better understanding of the types of Lumen experiences that have the largest impact on customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\n“Unstructured data represents close to 90% of the data generated today and Qualtrics AI enables organizations to extract rich information that paints a comprehensive view of customers’ experiences and pain points,” said Manisha Powar, Chief Product Officer of Qualtrics XM for Customer Experience. “Armed with this information, organizations can identify and prioritize the improvements that will have the most significant effect on customers’ emotions – boosting loyalty and profits.”\n\nEmployee recognition feeds business outcomes\n\nLumen also used Qualtrics to establish a powerful link between Employee Experience (EX) and customer outcomes. With insights from Qualtrics XM for Customer Experience, Lumen found that when their frontline service technicians feel recognized for delivering excellent customer service, they are nine times more likely to resolve customer issues in a single visit.\n\nBased on that insight, Lumen leaders stepped up the company’s promotion and recognition of great customer service within the company’s field organization. That’s led to savings on operational costs and time, as well as a more loyal and engaged workforce.\n\n“You cannot drive exceptional customer experience, without unlocking the employee experience,” said Nissen. “For us, focusing on both experiences and empowering our employees is unlocking growth, profitability and increased customer loyalty.”\n\nAbout Qualtrics\n\nQualtrics, the leader and creator of the experience management category, is a cloud-native software platform that empowers organizations to deliver exceptional experiences and build deep relationships with their customers and employees.

      "# [These State Governments Offer the Best Customer Service on 2024-05-23](https://www.qualtrics.com/news/these-state-governments-offer-the-best-customer-service/)\nPROVO, Utah & SEATTLE, May 23, 2024 – Illinois is ranked lowest by its residents for state government service, according to a new report from Qualtrics. Fewer than half (49%) of Illinois residents who had received a state service said they were satisfied. On the other end of the spectrum, the study found that Alaska (72%) has the highest overall satisfaction scores for state government services. Across the country, federal services like Medicare, USPS, and Social Security have the highest overall customer satisfaction ratings while programs like the DMV, SNAP and state tax services scored the lowest.\n\nGovernment agencies provide social safety benefits, health care, licensing, and myriad other services to residents across the US. But customer service from government agencies has traditionally lagged behind service in the private sector. Increasingly, consumers expect a higher level of service from government offices. President Biden issued an executive order in 2021 requiring federal agencies to improve their customer service.\n\nQualtrics asked nearly 20,000 people who have recently used at least one of nine state and federal government services about their experience, creating a new benchmark for customer experience across a range of state and federal services.\n\nHeading into an election year, state and federal government leaders are trying to gain the trust of their constituents. Improving overall customer satisfaction scores has a major impact on citizens’ view of their local government. People who were “extremely satisfied” with government services are 8.5x more likely to say they trust agencies will do the right thing, 9.0x to say government service providers care about them as a person and 7.5x to say agency leaders hold themselves to high ethical standards.\n\n“Top-performing government agencies utilize customer insights to pinpoint crucial customer needs, wants, and desires, and invest in cross-channel improvements that not only meet but exceed their expectations,” said Spencer Steed, Senior Vice President of Public Sector at Qualtrics. “The state services that are leading the way have undertaken the important work of listening to their customers through a variety of structured and unstructured channels to identify the most effective ways to make government easier to work with, the holy grail for customer satisfaction.”\n\nMedicare, Post Office top the satisfaction list\n\nGenerally, federal services produced more happy customers than state services, according to the research. Of the nine government services included in the study, residents were most satisfied with federal services like Medicare and the USPS and least satisfied with state services tax and SNAP.\n\nThe research shows that satisfaction did not vary greatly between online and in-person service experiences, but the more a person has to interact during a service experience, the less satisfied they tend to be with that experience. For example, government customers who had to switch between a website and in-person channels had lower overall scores.\n\nSatisfaction with the Department of Motor Vehicles – perhaps the most notorious agency for poor experiences, varied widely depending on the state. Nearly nine out of 10 (88%) North Dakota residents who visited the DMV in the last year said they were at least somewhat satisfied. In Iowa, 41% of respondents said they believe the DMV “cares about me as a person.” (Only 1% agreed with that statement in Hawaii, the lowest-ranked DMV experience).\n\nSatisfaction with government services is strongly correlated with household income and age, but not political ideology\n\n– Older residents and those with a higher income tended to be more satisfied with the services they received, and have a higher trust in government.\n\n– Higher-income households (>$100k) have satisfaction levels 18% higher than lower-income households (<$25k).\n\n– White customers generally have higher levels of satisfaction (62%) than Hispanic (55%), Black (57%) or customers of another race or two or more races (54%).\n\n– Qualtrics research also shows a similar “satisfaction stratification” based on age. There is a 19 percentage point difference between 18-24-year-olds and those older than 59+. Customers are on average 2.5p.p. more satisfied with every five year increase in age.\n\nPolitical affiliation – or whether Democrats or Republicans were in the governor’s mansion – did not correlate with customer satisfaction. Looking at the 2020 presidential vote, the difference in satisfaction with state services between Biden voters (64%) and Trump voters (60%) is small. Qualtrics research found only small correlations in satisfaction with government services based on party in power, region, urbanity vs. rurality, or demographic mix.\n\n“Our research shows that even in today’s politically polarized environment, customers base their trust largely on their most recent experiences with government,” said Crosby Burns, Government Industry Advisor with Qualtrics. “This should give public sector leaders motivation to engineer world-class experiences for their customers, who will continue to expect high levels of service for their taxpayer dollars.”\n\nAdditional Information\n\nTo learn more, download the full eBook and read the Qualtrics blog post.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe data for this report comes from a study of state and federal government customers that have used at least one of several services over the past 12 months. Qualtrics Government conducted this research in December 2023 through January 2024, sampling 14,605 state customers and 4,985 federal customers. Respondents represent all 50 states and the District of Columbia, with minimum sample size thresholds to ensure state-by-state comparisons. Analysis included weighting at the regional level to ensure adequate representation of demographic groups.\n\nAbout Qualtrics\n\nQualtrics, the leader and creator of the experience management category, is a cloud-native software platform that empowers organizations to deliver exceptional experiences and build deep relationships with their customers and employees.

      "# [Healthcare Leaders Deliver Impact and Scale with Qualtrics on 2024-03-13](https://www.qualtrics.com/news/healthcare-leaders-deliver-impact-and-scale-with-qualtrics/)\nPROVO, Utah & SEATTLE, March 13, 2024 – Healthcare leaders are continuing to partner with Qualtrics to make stressful and emotional care situations easier for their patients. Qualtrics helps healthcare organizations and healthcare providers better understand patient needs and respond to patients in the moment. In a recent Qualtrics report, consumers reported 16% of their recent experiences with hospitals and medical centers were very poor.\n\n“We have made great strides to drive quality, safety and experience, but there is still work to be done to help people with empathy and humanity throughout the entirety of the healthcare experience,” said Qualtrics Chief Medical Officer Dr. Adrienne Boissy. “Working with electronic health records and organizations that are iterating and exploring new ways to listen and respond to make improvements – without burdening clinicians – gives me hope for the future of healthcare.”\n\nHealthcare providers choose Qualtrics® to transform patient and provider experiences\n\nWakeMed Health & Hospitals, a not-for-profit health care system in Raleigh, N.C., is transforming from a system of measurement to a system of action by listening and responding. With Qualtrics, WakeMed will be collecting feedback across the continuum of care shortly after a visit. As a result, they will be gaining visibility into the patient journey in near real time. Any responses requiring action will immediately result in an assignment so patient feedback can be addressed in the moment. There are a multitude of touchpoints that affect how a patient views their overall healthcare experience, and a Qualtrics dashboard of the patient feedback data will give WakeMed actionable insights to make improvements at every stage in the patient’s journey.\n\nNorthwell Health, the largest health system in the northeast, which operates 21 hospitals and nearly 900 outpatient facilities, selected Qualtrics to better gauge how patients connect with its Financial Services team and drive meaningful action based on that feedback. Each individual aspect of a patient’s experience contributes to their overall perception of care received and the team at Northwell is on a mission to transform a historically viewed transaction like paying a bill into an experience differentiator. With a more holistic view of how patients and the Financial Services team interact, Northwell will be able to identify and resolve gaps, leverage feedback in real-time to coach team members, and help improve key performance indicators such as first call resolution of patient concerns.\n\nLeading organizations see improved results with insights from Qualtrics\n\nBon Secours Mercy Health, a leading Catholic healthcare system in the U.S. with 49 hospitals and more than 60,000 associates, utilizes the flexibility of the Qualtrics platform to combine experience data with data from multiple HR systems, enabling a holistic view of the associate experience. Bon Secours moved away from standard engagement surveys to a research-backed method of tracking experiences and metrics linked to desired outcomes, such as loyalty and well-being. By listening and acting on feedback, Bon Secours made improvements to benefits that resulted in a 5% reduction in turnover among registered nurses and 5% improvement in overall employee intent to stay.\n\nCHRISTUS Health, a health system with more than 600 centers, is now able to assess the overall experience of their patients. Through Qualtrics’ Closed Loop Ticketing system, CHRISTUS is following up with dissatisfied patients to address individual needs and identify common challenges across 230 medical practice sites, closing an average of 80 tickets per day. In measuring the impact of this program, CHRISTUS saw a three-point increase in likelihood to recommend scores among patients who received follow-up and enthusiasm from caregivers about in-the-moment fixes they could make.\n\nUniversity of Utah Health, which provides medical care, education and research across six states, implemented Qualtrics solutions to get patient feedback into the hands of providers and staff who can make a difference for a patient in the moment. Their focus is on making it easier for patients, but also making it easier for employees to do the right thing. With digital feedback technology in some patient rooms and a 100% increase in patient comments, U of U Health is scaling individual insights to transform its overall patient experience program, creating a continuous cycle of improvement.\n\nA new integration between Qualtrics and Epic will integrate Qualtrics patient experience insights with clinical and operational data. Epic is the largest provider of electronic health records for medical organizations in the US, including payers and retail pharmacies. Patients are bringing expectations from other industries into their interactions with healthcare, and the Epic-Qualtrics integration will help providers meet and exceed those expectations.\n\nFor more information, visit www.qualtrics.com/healthcare.\n\nAbout Qualtrics XM® for Healthcare\n\nQualtrics helps healthcare and life sciences organizations design experiences that improve satisfaction, loyalty and trust.

      "# [Duke renews contract with Qualtrics by Office of Information Technology on 2024-07-15](https://oit.duke.edu/news/duke-renews-contract-qualtrics/)\nThe university has reached an agreement on pricing, and there is no longer a risk of disruption with the Duke University/DKU-wide Qualtrics license at the end of the 2024 year. The new license covers the current volume of Qualtrics survey responses for another 5 years, through Dec 31, 2029.\n\nWho is covered under the new contract?\n\nThe contract that has been under negotiation includes users of the existing University and DKU service, as well as two other services used by the Health System:\n\nAcademic CoreXM (University/DKU)\n\nPatient Experience (Duke Health)\n\nDiscover for Contact Centers DHAS & DPC Triage (Duke Health)\n\nHow much will the new contract cost Duke?\n\nThe 2025 annual cost will be roughly 70 percent more than what the University paid in 2024 and 2.5x the license cost from 2023. However, it is a significant improvement over the initial proposed increase from the vendor which would have amounted to a 6x increase over the life of the contract, relative to 2023. The price now increases by ~3x relative to what the University paid in 2023.\n\nAn additional benefit is that the University now has a five-year contract over which to spread the increase.\n\nThe contract period also gives us more time gaining experience with current survey tools and upcoming tools on the market. We will also need to evaluate whether alternative funding options might be advisable in the future (e.g., for research projects, funding via grants may become an option).\n\nShould Duke researchers using Academic CoreXM still consider other survey tool options?\n\nIt is still important to consider other software for surveys with uncomplicated designs and where tracking longitudinal data is less essential. Duke will soon develop a request process to reduce the number of Qualtrics survey responses and, if necessary, direct them to a more appropriate survey tool. See a list of other survey tools available at Duke here: https://oit.duke.edu/service/survey-tools.\n\nUpdates on the new Qualtrics process will be shared broadly and posted on the OIT website: https://oit.duke.edu/service/qualtrics.\n\nHow do I know which tool is right for me?\n\nThe Office of Information Technology has developed a comparison chart to help Duke community members decide among various survey and forms tools - https://oit.duke.edu/help/articles/kb0037717.",
      "# [Beware Of Push Polls by Doug Hardy on 2024-07-01](https://ctnewsjunkie.com/2024/07/01/analysis-beware-of-push-polls/)\nA survey from Qualtrics that has been arriving via text message today appears to contain at least one “push poll” question related to President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and former president Donald Trump.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the term, a “push poll” is defined as “an ostensible opinion poll in which the true objective is to sway voters using loaded or manipulative questions.”\n\nIn this case, the survey is quite long and asks respondents dozens of multiple-choice questions about where they stand with respect to presidential political candidates and party preferences, as well as a separate section about preferences related to energy/environment policy.\n\nHowever, the push poll question arrives in the midst of the group about presidential politics, including questions about last week’s debate. The survey asks the following:\n\n“If you knew Vice President Kamala Harris would end up becoming president in a second Biden term because he could not complete the term, would that influence your vote?” The possible responses are as follows:\n\nNo, was already going to vote for someone else\n\nYes, will now NOT vote for Biden but am undecided now\n\nYes, will now NOT vote for Biden but was going to before\n\nYes, will now vote for Trump but wasn’t going to before\n\nUnsure\n\nAmong the five response options, there are none available to respondents who are still planning to support Biden and Harris regardless of Biden’s condition in the years ahead.\n\nThe only information available on the poll’s many pages about its source is a Grand Rapids, MI-area landline (616-616-7187) that lists no owner, the url (votercx.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_djswc9FR2YarL1A?UID=LALCT1936832) and the linked phrase “Powered by Qualtrics” at the bottom, which takes you here.\n\nOn their website, Qualtrics advertises “customer” and “pulse” surveys but it does not list any specific pricing for those services.\n\nQualtrics did not immediately return a phone call seeking information about who paid to use their survey software.",
