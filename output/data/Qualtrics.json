This license is built for business and has lots of analytics bells and whistles that are useless for research, and it also costs over double the annual subscription cost.\n\nMy SLAC is having a hard time justifying this price hike, so we're looking at alternative platforms.  We need something on par with Qualtrics in terms of question and output types, and the ability to have custom branding would be ideal (i.e. I don't want participants to be redirected to a random SurveyMonkey page after completing the survey).\n\nFor comparison, a site-wide license (unlimited responses) for my college with ~1200 students used to be $7500/year. Now it is limited to 1000 users and 25,000 responses for $15,000/year. We have been able to negotiate both of these prices down a little, but we're still looking at a $5k increase for more-restricted usage.\n\n## Comment ID jfqm2cy with +2 score by [(cequims, Reddit, 2023-04-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/jfqm2cy/) (in reply to ID 11ss3vs):\nJust got off the phone with our Qualtrics rep, and it's clear they have no interest in serving small businesses. They want to more or less double our license cost. I last did my research on different survey platforms about a year ago, and at that time I liked [Survey Sparrow](https://www.surveysparrow.com), so check them out.\n\n### Comment ID ke5j3n0 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/ke5j3n0/) (in reply to ID jfqm2cy):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID kxp1oz9 with +1 score by [(cequims, Reddit, 2024-04-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/kxp1oz9/) (in reply to ID ke5j3n0):\nSorry for the slow reply - I don't get on Reddit much. So far, I'm pretty happy with SurveySparrow. The features are sufficiently complex for just about everything our company needs to do across our many projects. The question options aren't as customizable as Qualtrics, and the automated reports could use a few improvements, but for the drastically lower cost I am happy to make adjustments to work with the available options. I will say that customer service is a bit spotty. They are often (but not always) available right away via their chat feature. I think most of their team is located in India, however, and sometimes time zone differences are an issue. My colleague on Pacific time tends says they often don't get back to her til the next day. I'm on East Coast time, and it's less of an issue. I also sometimes worry that because they are a smaller company, they may be less stable and more likely to have tech issues. For example, I once found that I couldn't edit data on the back end, then the next day it worked. And right now, there's a weird formatting issue where text is overlapping in the footer of the surveys. So there are definitely small signs that they are more scrappy than the big leagues. But our team of about 16 employees has been using it for about 10 months now, and it hasn't held us back.\n\n## Comment ID kzw0jm1 with +1 score by [(Spiritual-Dance-562, Reddit, 2024-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/11ss3vs/qualtrics_alternatives/kzw0jm1/) (in reply to ID 11ss3vs):\nQualtrics is clearly trying to eliminate small businesses.

This license is built for business and has lots of analytics bells and whistles that are useless for research, and it also costs over double the annual subscription cost.\n\nMy SLAC is having a hard time justifying this price hike, so we're looking at alternative platforms.  We need something on par with Qualtrics in terms of question and output types, and the ability to have custom branding would be ideal (i.e. I don't want participants to be redirected to a random SurveyMonkey page after completing the survey).\n\nFor comparison, a site-wide license (unlimited responses) for my college with ~1200 students used to be $7500/year. Now it is limited to 1000 users and 25,000 responses for $15,000/year. We have been able to negotiate both of these prices down a little, but we're still looking at a $5k increase for more-restricted usage.\n\n## Comment ID jcinizm with +7 score by [(cattyditty, Reddit, 2023-03-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/11ss012/qualtrics_alternatives/jcinizm/) (in reply to ID 11ss012):\nREDCap!

You can change this in question settings. This will help to ensure that respondents don't have to keep scrolling to the top of the page to see the the response options. People will forget what the response options are, especially if you have a larger number of response options. \n\nSet the questions to \"request response\". This will flag skipped questions for participants so they are asked if they want to continue the survey without answering a skipped question. This doesn't work for matrices though.\n\nUse multie blocks as you're setting up your survey. For example, if you have demographics questions, mental health questions, and substance use questions, put all of your demographics questions in one block, your mental health questions in second block, and your substance use questions in a third block.  This is for YOUR sake. It's easier to find/edit/move questions when you have multipe blocks rather than what could be 100+ questions placed into a single block. Using multipe blocks also makes setting up survey flow and skip logic more effective/efficient.\n\n## Comment ID ljzodjv with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-08-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/ljzodjv/) (in reply to ID 101qloz):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID lkbuqjj with +1 score by [(barrybulsara, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/lkbuqjj/) (in reply to ID ljzodjv):\n/u/Odd-Courage- is a bot account.\n\n## Comment ID lk4rvn9 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-08-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/lk4rvn9/) (in reply to ID 101qloz):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID lkbuj74 with +1 score by [(barrybulsara, Reddit, 2024-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/lkbuj74/) (in reply to ID lk4rvn9):\n/u/Odd-Courage- is a bot account.\n\n## Comment ID j2qfltq with +1 score by [(Decent-Reception-232, Reddit, 2023-01-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/101qloz/qualtrics_survey_tips/j2qfltq/) (in reply to ID 101qloz):\n1.

On review sites, they get high marks for being “well-rounded,” but when you dive into market researchers’ opinions, it’s a different story. The pricing complaints are real—it’s not transparent, and you end up paying way more than expected. Plus, customer service issues? Definitely frustrating when you’re dealing with tight deadlines and complex surveys.\n\nI think part of the problem is that Qualtrics has grown so much, and with that comes the loss of personalized support and that sharp focus on survey quality. It’s like they’re trying to be *everything* for *everyone*, and that just doesn’t work when you need reliability and flexibility in your research.\n\nIn my experience, if you’re looking for a solid alternative, SurveySparrow hits a sweet spot. It’s way more intuitive, so you don’t need a specialist breathing down your neck for every little thing. Plus, it’s self-serve, which is what a lot of people here seem to be looking for. You can easily run and manage your surveys without those constant check-ins from a project manager. And with automated workflows, real-time insights, and sentiment analysis baked in, it feels much lighter without sacrificing the important features.\n\nBut yeah, it seems like Qualtrics sticks around because switching can feel like a hassle, and it’s what a lot of agencies are already comfortable with. Still, the cracks are showing, and people are starting to explore other tools. Have any of you tried switching, or are you sticking with it because of familiarity?\n\n### Comment ID lnholkb with +1 score by [(reallymemorable, Reddit, 2024-09-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lnholkb/) (in reply to ID lnhny3o):\nSo why can't one of their many competitors unseat them?

the quality of the sample provided was so poor that we ended up removing all of the Qualtrics respondents from the final reporting.\n\nSo, that’s why I don’t like Qualtrics.\n\n### Comment ID lp9y2vw with +1 score by [(reallymemorable, Reddit, 2024-09-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lp9y2vw/) (in reply to ID lp39eev):\nWhat platform did you switch to?\n\n#### Comment ID lpwksqm with +1 score by [(jelybely8, Reddit, 2024-10-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lpwksqm/) (in reply to ID lp9y2vw):\nVoxco\n\n## Comment ID lx4df7p with +2 score by [(shkilo, Reddit, 2024-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lx4df7p/) (in reply to ID 1fijau3):\nIMO their platform has major usability issues and performance issues, and the customer support and account managers are abysmal.\n\nThe whole vibe I get from them...\n\n...from the sloppy and frustrating product design, to the lack of response to feedback provided to them, to their confusing support hub, to their ideation platform that basically ask you how much you'd be willing to pay for a proposed enhancement, to their support callback time estimates being consistently and significantly inaccurate, to their extensive knowledge base that somehow manages to never answer my questions...\n\n...is that they couldn't care less about the experience of their own customers.\n\n## Comment ID lnhospx with +2 score by [(AMKumle24, Reddit, 2024-09-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lnhospx/) (in reply to ID 1fijau3):\nThey also have severe control issues, they always need to have one of their specialists involved with a project, or they force implementation hours on you.\n\n### Comment ID lnjxs2t with +2 score by [(pnutbutterpirate, Reddit, 2024-09-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketresearch/comments/1fijau3/thoughts_on_qualtrics/lnjxs2t/) (in reply to ID lnhospx):\nThis has not been my experience.

I work for a very large org (300k+ employees). We currently have qualtrics but have been very unhappy with the stability and reliability of the platform. From random outages to things not working how they should, and then a lack of customer service, we’re pretty unhappy with them. \n\n\nThere are some up and coming challengers to Qualtrics such as Perceptyx and Medallia.

This list is a mix of pros and cons and is in no particular order:\n\n- the survey design functionality itself is superior to what you would find with most vendors.\n- data visualization through dashboards is highly effective for standard org use cases (eg manager and exec dashboards, filtering, etc.). The fact that your data lives in the same platform makes data eng work unnecessary.\n- the dashboards themselves are limited though if you're trying to do anything \"highly rigorous\" like include estimates based on weighting. \n- if you're looking to develop an organizational survey program Qualtrics will have everything you need for pretty much any use case an exec leadership team could currently dream up. However, Qualtrics is not built to support weekly or daily surveying. \n- Qualtrics employee survey platform is frustratingly more limited than their CX platform (see weighting issue above)\n- NLP capability is poor, but it is better than most other vendors. It will probably improve over time now that they have acquired Clarabridge (i think that's the name of the company anyway)\n- Qualtrics is $$$ and is likely going to become even more so in the future \n\nDifficult to know what to focus on without knowing your intended use case, but hopefully this is helpful!\n\n### Comment ID le79r9j with +1 score by [(ZestyMuffin85496, Reddit, 2024-07-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/le79r9j/) (in reply to ID haqn6tm):\nwould qualrics release your name to your employer if they stated they are supposed to be anonymous?\n\n## Comment ID hass6s3 with +4 score by [(armyprof, Reddit, 2021-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/hass6s3/) (in reply to ID pdiz5m):\nLet me preface my thoughts with some context.\n\nI’ve been the admin and key user for Qualtrics for two global companies for eight years now…I also do consulting on the side.  I have two certifications with them as well; the XM CM platforms.  My graduate work was in research methods and survey research was a big part of it.\n\nQualtrics has a lot going for it and has some problems too.  Overall I recommend it, but here’s a breakdown.\n\nPros:\n\nThe customer service is very good.  If you call you’ll get help.  In eight years and who knows how many calls I’ve yet to not get an answer to a question.  Sometimes the answer is no, but I’ve never had trouble reaching anyone or felt like they didn’t know what they were doing.  \n\n2:  the survey platform itself is pretty robust and will do about anything you need it too with a few exceptions.  And it’s pretty easy and intuitive to use.\n\n3:  the new tools like text and stats IQ or the cross tab tool are fantastic enhancements.  \n\n4:  the dashboard tool is excellent for helping other users explore their data.\n\nCons:\n\n1:  it’s expensive.\n\n2:  there are certain baffling features that it should have but doesn’t.  For example, being able to independently recode or reverse code items in a matrix, or device in what aggregation you want for scoring instead of just a sum.\n\n3:  reporting is a bit clunky.  They used to have a fantastic report tool that was super flexible.  But they dumbed it down to make it easier for beginners to use but less powerful.  You can’t, for example, resize the height of rows in tables or put things on the page freely.  \n\nOverall I find it a good tool, and use it successfully with client work constantly.  I do wish they’d listen to some suggestions sometimes, but overall I’m very satisfied with it.  \n\nGood luck!\n\n### Comment ID hatid6q with +1 score by [(Bite-Expensive, Reddit, 2021-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/hatid6q/) (in reply to ID hass6s3):\nThank you for the thorough overview!

So let’s say you have a matrix question with ten items on a 1-5 Likert scale.  With StatsIQ you can then do, say, an ANOVA on all those items or any subset of them by picking an IV (like ethnicity).  You’ll get all your results like significance, effect size, etc.  Super handy.\n\nText IQ is text analytics.  Topic/subtopics, and sentiment analysis.  Also super handy.\n\nThese can be used together.  You could, for example, do a comparison of means on a question using your sentiment categories as IVs.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n## Comment ID hatfq0s with +5 score by [(kongfukinny, Reddit, 2021-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/hatfq0s/) (in reply to ID pdiz5m):\nI’ve been running survey programs for some time now. Worked with and demoed various tools and currently using Qualtrics. Here’s my high level summary:\n\n1. Ur tool will depend on your needs. My company really likes to do surveys and they love to ask all sorts of wonky display logic type questions as well as create forms for events and other various use cases for surveys. This is really where Qualtrics shines over other tools. It has so many features that you can literally do anything with it. That said, if your looking for the simple most effective platform for engagement surveys, Qualtrics is not it.\n\n2. Cost is moderate IMO. It depends on the size of your business but it’s not the most expensive solution out there. I was quoted by Glint at twice the rate we pay for Qualtrics.\n\n3. Dashboards and analytics suck in Qualtrics. Tools like Glint or Peakon automate all the dash boarding for you. Qualtrics dashboarding and analytics is super admin cost heavy and isn’t nearly as robust something like PowerBI. That said if you have the resources, there is an SFTP integration with Qualtrics that could allow you to automate a pipeline to SQL and be able to automate dashboards for recurring surveys.\n\n4. Support for the most part is pretty bad. This surprised me. I work for a reputable tech company that I would think Qualtrics would consider a high profile client. It took us to threatening to end the contract early for them to switch us to a more involved CSM. This was night and day compares to when I previously used Glint where our CSM was always on top of things and helpful.\n\n5. Their “science” isn’t very scientific IMO. They have a hard time giving me straight answers on where their questions come from, why they design questions the way they do, or what research supports their validity and reliability. This again is unlock other platforms I’ve used which are happy to share white papers and research to support the utility of their measures.\n\nTL;DR and going back to your original question about what they provide that others don’t, we’ll not much really. But again, it depends on your needs. They provide dashboards but not automated like some platforms. They provide question banks but validity is questionable compared to other platforms. Their big sell is in their wide ranging features, but if your use case is simply engagement surveys, these might not be useful to you.\n\n### Comment ID hathqz3 with +2 score by [(Bite-Expensive, Reddit, 2021-08-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/hathqz3/) (in reply to ID hatfq0s):\nThank you for such a thoughtful response!\n\n## Comment ID haqj466 with +3 score by [(aeywaka, Reddit, 2021-08-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/haqj466/) (in reply to ID pdiz5m):\nFrome someone not currently able to use qualtrics (would take a large initiative to implement).

Their crowdsourcing services produce low quality data, customer service unhelpful, and actual survey system is static with no new developments to do sound, rigorous data collection. More and more they are chasing enterprise solutions, new markets, and feel increasingly like the SPSS of survey solutions. They would rather spend a ton of money on huge fluff events with oprah as a speaker than actually build out their tools.\n\nThe only advantages include it is easy to use, has a few nice embedding and mail survey features, and offers both the storage and interface for data collection. While I don't have an immediate alternative I would seriously consider any other I/O or research oriented survey platform as they can easily mimic an easy user interface but provide a much better platform with more capabilities.\n\n## Comment ID jd44nu6 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-03-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/jd44nu6/) (in reply to ID pdiz5m):\n[removed]\n\n### Comment ID jd44nvk with +1 score by [(AutoModerator, Reddit, 2023-03-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/pdiz5m/for_practitioners_what_are_the_advantages_of/jd44nvk/) (in reply to ID jd44nu6):\nYou are a new user with less than two weeks of reddit activity.

          "advice": "Don’t risk selling long-term competitive advantages and strategic value differentiators for short-term ROI and immediate profit margins. Qualtrics’ platform is ripe for disruption if we do not stay at the bleeding edge of emerging technology. To do this, Silver Lake, ELT, and the board need to be willing to invest heavily in the people that make this business special. Qualtrics had the rise that it did (and created generational wealth for many people, especially much of the board and the leadership team) because of the hard work of a mission-driven team. If Qualtrics is going to do this again and hit 10X or 100X value multiples and become a generational SaaS company, issues with employee engagement and retention of top talent need to be addressed immediately. Here is what I would recommend: 1. Qualtrics needs to rebuild a culture of trust and collaboration, and that has to be driven through transparency and accountability at the very top. If leaders signal that they trust employees and want them to succeed, employees will trust leadership to guide them. 2. Invest heavily in systems, processes, and people. Qualtrics has significant needs for enterprise systems that work together (for example, the CRM and HRIS are poorly integrated with the other systems that they rely on). The new promotion philosophy makes sense from a cost-saving standpoint, but Qualtrics should not be cost-saving if that means we’re losing top talent that would deliver outsized value in the future. 3. Reconnect employees with the values and the mission that made this company “bigger than itself”. Becoming a top SaaS company is not motivating to the vast majority of employees if they have only marginal incentives for achieving that goal. Qualtrics’ investors and the board either needs share a much greater portion of the equity and give employees much more lucrative LTI for the financial success of the business, OR leadership needs to develop a culture that prioritizes CSR and the collective good Qualtrics can provide the world and the communities in which we operate. The company needs to do more than simply matching employee contributions to 5fortheFight. How will Qualtrics support vulnerable and marginalized people? Promote equitable, fair, inclusive, and just policies in the community? Protect the environment? How will Qualtrics be a force for good? Demonstrating good stewardship and social governance through corporate action will make Qualtrics an employer and a brand that employees and customers can be proud of.",

          "cons": "“Fast-paced growth SaaS company” also means major organizational changes are constant; the change fatigue is real and can be a lot to manage at times (I have been with Q for 7 years and have been through at least as many re-orgs). Recent layoffs (October 2023) have dampened moral and eroded trust in the exec leadership team, but it seems like the culture is rebounding. The hybrid work policy is not for everyone. There is a significant lack of diversity amongst the leadership team- you will see women and underrepresented minorities in the executive team, but the core group of decision makers (the Founder &amp; Board Chairman, CEO, COO, Chief Product Officer, President, many sales leaders) are all white men from Provo, Utah. Since being taken private again, Qualtrics’ promotion philosophy has become much more conservative and there are fewer opportunities for accelerated advancement compared to what you might find at a pre-IPO startup. The private equity firm that owns Q is heavily focused on profit margins, which may risk product development when many competitors are investing heavily in R&amp;D for AI.",

The performance expectations are aggressive, but the bonuses are equally aggressive- exceptional work is recognized and rewarded here. It takes a lot to be exceptional with the kind of peers we have at Qualtrics, but I would rather deliver average work at this company than be a star performer some place else. The best part is the people that work here- there is a high bar for hiring and this place is filled with talented, motivated, intelligent, and empathetic people. The frontline managers and middle managers are generally very good and they care deeply about the success of their teams and their people.

And with full realization that no one is perfect, and success is messy and employees can't just blame management for their own shortcomings and should look in the mirror more often. Guilty as charged.  But management seems to be missing just one critical awareness.\n\nSome things even XM can't measure.  X Data helps, but it will never tell the whole story. Do things to build trust and connection and social capital that don't make sense on your financial statements.  Don't tell the employees that they wanted more money and less parties based on their own survey responses. Give them both.  Don't remind them that it will all be worth it because of the money they will make and the financial strategy for the stage of growth and the market we are in, and this new level of chess that private equity is taking us to. That will not fix the core structural issue that the people at this company are not as connected with a sense of meaning and belonging as deeply as they used to be even if on the engagement surveys lots of people say they have a best friend at the organization, and they like their manager.    The cost of ignoring that unseen disconnection, far outweighs any \"frivolous\" expense incurred to foster relationships again.  In my experience, Qualtrics is made up of some of the most brilliant and great people in the world who want to work hard and be consistent and inclusive and do what is right and celebrate together when they all get rich or richer if they catch the curve right and persevere.  They are proud to work there and of what Qualtrics can do and the impact its having in the world, and are willing to stick with it through almost anything and forgive all the mistakes and let downs and overpromises while they watch executives who urged them to play the long game, strategically take their shares and run.  But it seems like despite all your knowledge and experience and resources and expertise and the respect of your brand, you are messing up one thing that you can't mess up...\n\nYou can't be customer-obsessed if you don't treat every single one of your employees as your most important customers.  \n\nAccountability can co-exist with this, and you can keep your investors happy. And the employees are not usually as spoiled or entitled or ungrateful as they might seem.  They are just tired and disconnected.  Don't just say that employee experience engagement has gotten better based on quarter-over-quarter survey results.   No one cares.  Its interesting insight, but no one who is not responsible for that number actually cares about that number.  And its only going to frustrate them  to hear that win if they don't feel it.  It has to be something shared and palpable that only a human can sense. Use AI and stats and surveys and dashboards for everything else.  Make the investors happy.  But go back to making the employees first.  That's how you got here.  Thanks for all the years and work and risks taken you have provided and sacrificed to make it possible.  You deserve it.  No shame.  Just consider it. ",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "Take this with a grain of salt. But they forfeited their internal culture to keep winning bigger and faster. I hope they get it back. They had a harder and harder time adapting to their own rapid and relentless growth and success as time went on. I think they tried hard, but it just had so much unchecked momentum, that it became chaotic and disjointed to respond to the sheer amount of work and demand it created. Hiring more rapidly didn't fix the problem. There was a lot of collateral damage in the operational cohesiveness and culture of one team that was previously in the org. Lots of conflicting incentives had gradually developed that didn't get addressed enough or mapped or aligned very well along the way, so the individuals who desperately needed to work together with a benevolent mindset across departments had progressively lower natural motivation or patience to keep playing as a team. But they are working on it.",

There are opportunities for progression, but it is mostly in positions that are entry level (Technical Account Manager, Enterprise Support, and Resolution Analyst.) Enterprise Support does the same work, but gets paid more. It would drive me crazy when people in that team would ask me questions, and I would just think that I have the same learning and training, and they're getting paid more than me to do the same work.

Management’s inability to listen (starting with skip level manager and up to company management) was shocking. Lots of burn out. Many people were happy to be in the lay-off group and many were sad they weren’t. Somehow the company manages to attract amazing people, so I genuinely hope they’re able to turn things around and rebuild. Really grateful for everything I learned at Q and wish them the best!",

Big layoffs recently, many jobs moved to lower cost locations and other countries, no leadership accountability whatsoever. Total chaos followed. RTO enforcement coming. Pay cuts (or absence of refreshers) likely coming. Everyone good is looking to leave soon. Product is also incredibly boring to work on although I don't personally mind as long as working hours stay low. Not a single person in the C-suite deserves to be there. They are driving the company away from being a survey platform (which we excel at) to being a management suggestion tool (which we're bad at and customers don't need). They set on this path when the economy was good, and many customers were shelling out for a luxury product and making decisions based on employee and customer feedback. But now that the tech economy is bad, decision making is driven only by profit, making Qualtrics' experience management insights irrelevant. For example, Qualtrics can tell Delta that customers want extra leg room on flights. But Delta doesn't care, they need the money from those 3 extra rows. It is a rare case when Qualtrics can provide an insight that 1.) is novel and 2.) is actionable in a profitable way.",

Big layoffs recently, many jobs moved to lower cost locations and other countries, no leadership accountability whatsoever. Total chaos followed. RTO enforcement coming. Pay cuts (or absence of refreshers) likely coming. Everyone good is looking to leave soon. Product is also incredibly boring to work on although I don't personally mind as long as working hours stay low. Not a single person in the C-suite deserves to be there. They are driving the company away from being a survey platform (which we excel at) to being a management suggestion tool (which we're bad at and customers don't need). They set on this path when the economy was good, and many customers were shelling out for a luxury product and making decisions based on employee and customer feedback. But now that the tech economy is bad, decision making is driven only by profit, making Qualtrics' experience management insights irrelevant. For example, Qualtrics can tell Delta that customers want extra leg room on flights. But Delta doesn't care, they need the money from those 3 extra rows. It is a rare case when Qualtrics can provide an insight that 1.) is novel and 2.) is actionable in a profitable way.",

Management’s inability to listen (starting with skip level manager and up to company management) was shocking. Lots of burn out.

        "advice": "Don’t risk selling long-term competitive advantages and strategic value differentiators for short-term ROI and immediate profit margins. Qualtrics’ platform is ripe for disruption if we do not stay at the bleeding edge of emerging technology. To do this, Silver Lake, ELT, and the board need to be willing to invest heavily in the people that make this business special. Qualtrics had the rise that it did (and created generational wealth for many people, especially much of the board and the leadership team) because of the hard work of a mission-driven team. If Qualtrics is going to do this again and hit 10X or 100X value multiples and become a generational SaaS company, issues with employee engagement and retention of top talent need to be addressed immediately. Here is what I would recommend: 1. Qualtrics needs to rebuild a culture of trust and collaboration, and that has to be driven through transparency and accountability at the very top. If leaders signal that they trust employees and want them to succeed, employees will trust leadership to guide them. 2. Invest heavily in systems, processes, and people. Qualtrics has significant needs for enterprise systems that work together (for example, the CRM and HRIS are poorly integrated with the other systems that they rely on). The new promotion philosophy makes sense from a cost-saving standpoint, but Qualtrics should not be cost-saving if that means we’re losing top talent that would deliver outsized value in the future. 3. Reconnect employees with the values and the mission that made this company “bigger than itself”. Becoming a top SaaS company is not motivating to the vast majority of employees if they have only marginal incentives for achieving that goal. Qualtrics’ investors and the board either needs share a much greater portion of the equity and give employees much more lucrative LTI for the financial success of the business, OR leadership needs to develop a culture that prioritizes CSR and the collective good Qualtrics can provide the world and the communities in which we operate. The company needs to do more than simply matching employee contributions to 5fortheFight. How will Qualtrics support vulnerable and marginalized people? Promote equitable, fair, inclusive, and just policies in the community? Protect the environment? How will Qualtrics be a force for good? Demonstrating good stewardship and social governance through corporate action will make Qualtrics an employer and a brand that employees and customers can be proud of.",
        "cons": "“Fast-paced growth SaaS company” also means major organizational changes are constant; the change fatigue is real and can be a lot to manage at times (I have been with Q for 7 years and have been through at least as many re-orgs). Recent layoffs (October 2023) have dampened moral and eroded trust in the exec leadership team, but it seems like the culture is rebounding. The hybrid work policy is not for everyone. There is a significant lack of diversity amongst the leadership team- you will see women and underrepresented minorities in the executive team, but the core group of decision makers (the Founder &amp; Board Chairman, CEO, COO, Chief Product Officer, President, many sales leaders) are all white men from Provo, Utah. Since being taken private again, Qualtrics’ promotion philosophy has become much more conservative and there are fewer opportunities for accelerated advancement compared to what you might find at a pre-IPO startup. The private equity firm that owns Q is heavily focused on profit margins, which may risk product development when many competitors are investing heavily in R&amp;D for AI.",

Change is constant, so there are lots of opportunities for making a meaningful impact on the success of the business. The pay is competitive in most markets for most roles, and the benefits are fantastic. 401k match, equity options, STI and LTI, lunches in most offices. The performance expectations are aggressive, but the bonuses are equally aggressive- exceptional work is recognized and rewarded here. It takes a lot to be exceptional with the kind of peers we have at Qualtrics, but I would rather deliver average work at this company than be a star performer some place else. The best part is the people that work here- there is a high bar for hiring and this place is filled with talented, motivated, intelligent, and empathetic people. The frontline managers and middle managers are generally very good and they care deeply about the success of their teams and their people.

And with full realization that no one is perfect, and success is messy and employees can't just blame management for their own shortcomings and should look in the mirror more often. Guilty as charged.  But management seems to be missing just one critical awareness.\n\nSome things even XM can't measure.  X Data helps, but it will never tell the whole story. Do things to build trust and connection and social capital that don't make sense on your financial statements.  Don't tell the employees that they wanted more money and less parties based on their own survey responses. Give them both.  Don't remind them that it will all be worth it because of the money they will make and the financial strategy for the stage of growth and the market we are in, and this new level of chess that private equity is taking us to. That will not fix the core structural issue that the people at this company are not as connected with a sense of meaning and belonging as deeply as they used to be even if on the engagement surveys lots of people say they have a best friend at the organization, and they like their manager.    The cost of ignoring that unseen disconnection, far outweighs any \"frivolous\" expense incurred to foster relationships again.  In my experience, Qualtrics is made up of some of the most brilliant and great people in the world who want to work hard and be consistent and inclusive and do what is right and celebrate together when they all get rich or richer if they catch the curve right and persevere.  They are proud to work there and of what Qualtrics can do and the impact its having in the world, and are willing to stick with it through almost anything and forgive all the mistakes and let downs and overpromises while they watch executives who urged them to play the long game, strategically take their shares and run.  But it seems like despite all your knowledge and experience and resources and expertise and the respect of your brand, you are messing up one thing that you can't mess up...\n\nYou can't be customer-obsessed if you don't treat every single one of your employees as your most important customers.  \n\nAccountability can co-exist with this, and you can keep your investors happy. And the employees are not usually as spoiled or entitled or ungrateful as they might seem.  They are just tired and disconnected.  Don't just say that employee experience engagement has gotten better based on quarter-over-quarter survey results.   No one cares.  Its interesting insight, but no one who is not responsible for that number actually cares about that number.  And its only going to frustrate them  to hear that win if they don't feel it.  It has to be something shared and palpable that only a human can sense. Use AI and stats and surveys and dashboards for everything else.  Make the investors happy.  But go back to making the employees first.  That's how you got here.  Thanks for all the years and work and risks taken you have provided and sacrificed to make it possible.  You deserve it.  No shame.  Just consider it. ",
        "cons": "Take this with a grain of salt. But they forfeited their internal culture to keep winning bigger and faster. I hope they get it back. They had a harder and harder time adapting to their own rapid and relentless growth and success as time went on. I think they tried hard, but it just had so much unchecked momentum, that it became chaotic and disjointed to respond to the sheer amount of work and demand it created. Hiring more rapidly didn't fix the problem. There was a lot of collateral damage in the operational cohesiveness and culture of one team that was previously in the org. Lots of conflicting incentives had gradually developed that didn't get addressed enough or mapped or aligned very well along the way, so the individuals who desperately needed to work together with a benevolent mindset across departments had progressively lower natural motivation or patience to keep playing as a team.

Because the number of choices are carried forward from previous questions, ALL might equal anything between 1 and 12 depending on the respondent.\n\nI’ve also investigated using Display Logic on Q5, but again I’m unsure how to specify “Display Q5 only if there is at least one unselected choice from Q4.”\n\nFYI I would like to avoid adding text to Q5 that says something like, “If no answer choices are displayed, please continue the survey” but I fear I might have to do just that if I cannot automate the skip / display logic.\n\nThank you for any advice or guidance you can provide!!!",
      "# [Qualtrics Appoints Gurdeep Singh Pall as President, AI Strategy on 2024-04-17](https://www.qualtrics.com/news/qualtrics-appoints-gurdeep-singh-pall-as-president-ai-strategy/)\nPROVO, Utah & SEATTLE (April 17, 2024) — Qualtrics, the leader and creator of the experience management (XM) category, today announced the appointment of Gurdeep Singh Pall as its first-ever President, AI Strategy. Pall will guide the company’s AI initiatives as Qualtrics develops powerful, generative, causal and predictive AI innovations powered by the world’s largest database of human sentiment. Qualtrics AI seamlessly integrates billions of data points across the customer and employee journey to drive action that personalizes experiences, at scale.\n\nCompanies have troves of experience data: chat logs, social media feeds, feedback surveys, call center recordings. But they often struggle to leverage this data to drive tangible business outcomes. AI is accelerating their ability to take action. Pall will work alongside the company’s technology and product teams to drive a transformative vision and roadmap for Qualtrics’ use of AI in experience management. He will be based in Seattle and be a member of the senior leadership team.\n\nPall brings more than 30 years of experience at Microsoft, where, as a technology leader and executive, he helped build and promote key products including Windows, Teams, Skype and Bing. Most recently, Pall was responsible for creating new products and solutions with emergent AI technologies. As part of the Technology and Research leadership team that spearheaded, among other things, Microsoft’s OpenAI partnership, he had a ringside perspective into the pace of AI developments and AI’s potential to change the way humans experience the world.\n\nPall was a technology leader at Microsoft through three transformative eras of technology – the personal computing and internet revolution, the advent of virtual communications platforms such as Microsoft Teams, and, most recently, new applications of emergent AI.\n\nIn today’s landscape, every organization is looking to AI to help them analyze vast amounts of data and connect information in unprecedented ways. Qualtrics AI creates a competitive advantage for companies in every industry by connecting human experiences across organizations to drive actions that protect revenue, drive growth, and create scale. Qualtrics’ fully-enabled AI platform allows companies to identify risk and resolve customer issues immediately and drives understanding of employee needs to keep them engaged and productive, preventing unwanted attrition. In 2023, Qualtrics announced a commitment to invest $500 million in AI innovation through 2027.\n\n“AI is the most transformative technology that the world has ever seen, and we are betting big on it, as a company, by hiring Gurdeep to set and accelerate a visionary agenda to make business more human,” said Qualtrics CEO Zig Serafin. “This exciting new addition to our leadership team sets us up to be out front, with our customers, leading into the new era of AI-powered experience management.”\n\n“Qualtrics occupies a very unique corner of the world as we shift from the age of software into the age of AI,” Pall said. “Experience is one of the most important aspects of our world today, and my new role is an exciting opportunity to help Qualtrics bring AI to bear on every industry around the globe, to create enormous impact for customers, employees and organizations.”",

      "# [Healthcare Leaders Deliver Impact and Scale with Qualtrics on 2024-03-13](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/healthcare-leaders-deliver-impact-and-scale-with-qualtrics-302087772.html)\nPROVO, Utah and SEATTLE, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Healthcare leaders are continuing to partner with Qualtrics to make stressful and emotional care situations easier for their patients. Qualtrics helps healthcare organizations and healthcare providers better understand patient needs and respond to patients in the moment. In a recent Qualtrics report, consumers reported 16% of their recent experiences with hospitals and medical centers were very poor.\n\n\"We have made great strides to drive quality, safety and experience, but there is still work to be done to help people with empathy and humanity throughout the entirety of the healthcare experience,\" said Qualtrics Chief Medical Officer Dr. Adrienne Boissy. \"Working with electronic health records and organizations that are iterating and exploring new ways to listen and respond to make improvements - without burdening clinicians - gives me hope for the future of healthcare.\"\n\nHealthcare providers choose Qualtrics® to transform patient and provider experiences\n\nWakeMed Health & Hospitals, a not-for-profit health care system in Raleigh, N.C., is transforming from a system of measurement to a system of action by listening and responding. With Qualtrics, WakeMed will be collecting feedback across the continuum of care shortly after a visit. As a result, they will be gaining visibility into the patient journey in near real time. Any responses requiring action will immediately result in an assignment so patient feedback can be addressed in the moment. There are a multitude of touchpoints that affect how a patient views their overall healthcare experience, and a Qualtrics dashboard of the patient feedback data will give WakeMed actionable insights to make improvements at every stage in the patient's journey.\n\nNorthwell Health, the largest health system in the northeast, which operates 21 hospitals and nearly 900 outpatient facilities, selected Qualtrics to better gauge how patients connect with its Financial Services team and drive meaningful action based on that feedback. Each individual aspect of a patient's experience contributes to their overall perception of care received and the team at Northwell is on a mission to transform a historically viewed transaction like paying a bill into an experience differentiator. With a more holistic view of how patients and the Financial Services team interact, Northwell will be able to identify and resolve gaps, leverage feedback in real-time to coach team members, and help improve key performance indicators such as first call resolution of patient concerns.\n\nLeading organizations see improved results with insights from Qualtrics\n\nBon Secours Mercy Health, a leading Catholic healthcare system in the U.S. with 49 hospitals and more than 60,000 associates, utilizes the flexibility of the Qualtrics platform to combine experience data with data from multiple HR systems, enabling a holistic view of the associate experience. Bon Secours moved away from standard engagement surveys to a research-backed method of tracking experiences and metrics linked to desired outcomes, such as loyalty and well-being. By listening and acting on feedback, Bon Secours made improvements to benefits that resulted in a 5% reduction in turnover among registered nurses and 5% improvement in overall employee intent to stay.\n\nCHRISTUS Health, a health system with more than 600 centers, is now able to assess the overall experience of their patients. Through Qualtrics' Closed Loop Ticketing system, CHRISTUS is following up with dissatisfied patients to address individual needs and identify common challenges across 230 medical practice sites, closing an average of 80 tickets per day. In measuring the impact of this program, CHRISTUS saw a three-point increase in likelihood to recommend scores among patients who received follow-up and enthusiasm from caregivers about in-the-moment fixes they could make.\n\nUniversity of Utah Health, which provides medical care, education and research across six states, implemented Qualtrics solutions to get patient feedback into the hands of providers and staff who can make a difference for a patient in the moment. Their focus is on making it easier for patients, but also making it easier for employees to do the right thing. With digital feedback technology in some patient rooms and a 100% increase in patient comments, U of U Health is scaling individual insights to transform its overall patient experience program, creating a continuous cycle of improvement.\n\nA new integration between Qualtrics and Epic will integrate Qualtrics patient experience insights with clinical and operational data. Epic is the largest provider of electronic health records for medical organizations in the US, including payers and retail pharmacies. Patients are bringing expectations from other industries into their interactions with healthcare, and the Epic-Qualtrics integration will help providers meet and exceed those expectations.\n\nFor more information, visit www.qualtrics.com/healthcare.\n\nAbout Qualtrics XM® for Healthcare\n\nQualtrics helps healthcare and life sciences organizations design experiences that improve satisfaction, loyalty and trust.

The partnership will help organizations more deeply understand relationships between quality, safety, and patient experiences.\n\nThis collaboration will move beyond traditional siloed measurement, combining key metrics and benchmarks Vizient and Qualtrics measure in order to drive meaningful improvements in patient outcomes and operational efficiency.\n\nUniversity of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann Health System, and Stanford Health Care—leaders in both clinical care and patient experience— participated in a pilot analysis for this groundbreaking initiative. The results of an initial analysis, presented this week at the Vizient Connections Summit, linked patient experience metrics such as clearer medical provider communication to important clinical outcomes, like emergency room visits, complications, and readmissions.\n\n\"Quality and patient experience are interrelated, but data is not easy to analyze at the patient level. By bringing quality, safety, and experience data together, we believe we can unlock the most impactful drivers of healthcare performance across multiple domains and the relationships between them,\" said David Levine, MD, FACEP, Chief Medical Officer for Vizient. \"This level of depth in insights has not been achieved in healthcare to date given siloed datasets and limited analytics.\"\n\n\"The initial analysis confirms so much of what we all believe: that the perception of experience is significantly related to clinical outcomes,\" said Dr. Adrienne Boissy, Chief Medical Officer, Qualtrics. \"But the thoughtful rigor of this work and the near term potential to focus improvement efforts of hardworking teams, prioritize interventions, and demonstrate value in dollars and operational gains is even more compelling.\"\n\nA New Era of Healthcare Performance Measurement\n\nHistorically, healthcare organizations have relied on siloed, retrospective data to measure performance and patient satisfaction. This new partnership between Vizient and Qualtrics will introduce a dynamic, forward-looking approach, allowing healthcare organizations to proactively manage performance and address clinical challenges before they manifest in performance data and drive continuous improvement with dynamic, actionable metrics that evolve with changing patient expectations and clinical environments.\n\nIdeal outcomes of the collaboration include:\n\nAnticipate Patient Outcomes: Harness patient feedback to predict clinical and operational outcomes, such as readmission rates, length of stay, and adverse clinical outcomes.\n\nClose the Gap Between Experience and Performance: Identify correlations between patient and clinical outcomes, providing healthcare leaders with the insights needed to address care gaps before they impact performance.\n\nDevelop Modern Experience Measurement: Define key elements of modern patient experience measurement that reflect real time performance, patient reported outcomes, and align to patient centered principles.\n\nFoundational Analyses with Leading Health Systems\n\nAn initial analysis of clinical and patient experience data from mutual clients University of Utah Health, Memorial Hermann Health System, and Stanford Health Care demonstrates the power of patient experience to drive better healthcare outcomes.\n\nKey findings included:\n\nPatients having a positive perception of communication with their caregivers was significantly associated with reductions in length of stay, 30-day readmissions, and emergency room visits.\n\nAmong inpatients with limited healthcare access, those who did not feel that their preferences were considered in their discharge plan were more likely to visit the emergency department within 30 days.\n\nBetter provider explanations could help mitigate the impact of adverse clinical events. Patients who rated provider explanations negatively exhibited significantly worse overall patient satisfaction when complications occurred, an effect that reversed when patients positively rated provider explanations.\n\nParticipating hospital leaders praised the collaboration and the insights delivered in the pilot.\n\n\"The combined analytics power of Qualtrics and Vizient allows us to break down data silos and gain actionable insights that directly enhance patient care,\" said Dan Lundergan, CEO at University of Utah Health Hospitals and Clinics. \"By understanding the connections between quality measures and patient experiences, we are better equipped to deliver high-value, patient-centered healthcare.\"\n\n\"This collaboration is a transformative step forward for health care.

To help us best support and communicate with riders who speak languages other than English, we want your feedback through a new survey.\n\nThis survey will help us continue to give a voice to everyone in our community. The survey is available in 14 languages to help us reach more people than ever before.\n\nCompleting the survey could take up to 10 minutes. At the end of the survey, you can enter to win a $100 gift card or a $50 Hop card.\n\nThe survey will be open through Dec. 31, 2024. We welcome community members of all languages to participate.\n\nWhy this feedback is important\n\nData from TriMet and the 2020 U.S. Census shows that nearly 119,000 people or roughly 8% of residents over the age of five in our tri-county service area have limited ability to read, write and speak English. TriMet and our community partners connect with people in multiple languages about how to use our transit service through our outreach and at local events.\n\nThis survey will build on that. We will use what we learn to improve access to TriMet services and make it easier to ride for people who may have difficulty understanding English.\n\nOur goal is to inform, motivate and empower everyone in our community to use public transit.

      "# [Duke renews contract with Qualtrics by Office of Information Technology on 2024-07-15](https://oit.duke.edu/news/duke-renews-contract-qualtrics/)\nThe university has reached an agreement on pricing, and there is no longer a risk of disruption with the Duke University/DKU-wide Qualtrics license at the end of the 2024 year. The new license covers the current volume of Qualtrics survey responses for another 5 years, through Dec 31, 2029.\n\nWho is covered under the new contract?\n\nThe contract that has been under negotiation includes users of the existing University and DKU service, as well as two other services used by the Health System:\n\nAcademic CoreXM (University/DKU)\n\nPatient Experience (Duke Health)\n\nDiscover for Contact Centers DHAS & DPC Triage (Duke Health)\n\nHow much will the new contract cost Duke?\n\nThe 2025 annual cost will be roughly 70 percent more than what the University paid in 2024 and 2.5x the license cost from 2023. However, it is a significant improvement over the initial proposed increase from the vendor which would have amounted to a 6x increase over the life of the contract, relative to 2023. The price now increases by ~3x relative to what the University paid in 2023.\n\nAn additional benefit is that the University now has a five-year contract over which to spread the increase.\n\nThe contract period also gives us more time gaining experience with current survey tools and upcoming tools on the market. We will also need to evaluate whether alternative funding options might be advisable in the future (e.g., for research projects, funding via grants may become an option).\n\nShould Duke researchers using Academic CoreXM still consider other survey tool options?\n\nIt is still important to consider other software for surveys with uncomplicated designs and where tracking longitudinal data is less essential. Duke will soon develop a request process to reduce the number of Qualtrics survey responses and, if necessary, direct them to a more appropriate survey tool. See a list of other survey tools available at Duke here: https://oit.duke.edu/service/survey-tools.\n\nUpdates on the new Qualtrics process will be shared broadly and posted on the OIT website: https://oit.duke.edu/service/qualtrics.\n\nHow do I know which tool is right for me?\n\nThe Office of Information Technology has developed a comparison chart to help Duke community members decide among various survey and forms tools - https://oit.duke.edu/help/articles/kb0037717.",
      "# [Beware Of Push Polls by Doug Hardy on 2024-07-01](https://ctnewsjunkie.com/2024/07/01/analysis-beware-of-push-polls/)\nA survey from Qualtrics that has been arriving via text message today appears to contain at least one “push poll” question related to President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and former president Donald Trump.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the term, a “push poll” is defined as “an ostensible opinion poll in which the true objective is to sway voters using loaded or manipulative questions.”\n\nIn this case, the survey is quite long and asks respondents dozens of multiple-choice questions about where they stand with respect to presidential political candidates and party preferences, as well as a separate section about preferences related to energy/environment policy.\n\nHowever, the push poll question arrives in the midst of the group about presidential politics, including questions about last week’s debate. The survey asks the following:\n\n“If you knew Vice President Kamala Harris would end up becoming president in a second Biden term because he could not complete the term, would that influence your vote?” The possible responses are as follows:\n\nNo, was already going to vote for someone else\n\nYes, will now NOT vote for Biden but am undecided now\n\nYes, will now NOT vote for Biden but was going to before\n\nYes, will now vote for Trump but wasn’t going to before\n\nUnsure\n\nAmong the five response options, there are none available to respondents who are still planning to support Biden and Harris regardless of Biden’s condition in the years ahead.\n\nThe only information available on the poll’s many pages about its source is a Grand Rapids, MI-area landline (616-616-7187) that lists no owner, the url (votercx.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_djswc9FR2YarL1A?UID=LALCT1936832) and the linked phrase “Powered by Qualtrics” at the bottom, which takes you here.\n\nOn their website, Qualtrics advertises “customer” and “pulse” surveys but it does not list any specific pricing for those services.\n\nQualtrics did not immediately return a phone call seeking information about who paid to use their survey software.",
