Verkada serves more than 28,000 customers in over 70 countries [(Wikipedia, 2020)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkada) [(Channel Sales Manager, Austin TX - Verkada Inc)](cache://builtin/12).\n\nVerkada specializes in integrating security equipment such as video cameras, access control systems, and environmental sensors with cloud-based machine vision and artificial intelligence. Their product suite includes video security cameras, access control systems, environmental sensors, alarms, workplace systems, and intercoms, all integrated into a single cloud-based platform designed for simplicity and scalability [(AGC/DGC, Product Legal - Verkada Inc)](https://www.builtinsf.com/job/agcdgc-product-legal/212557) [(Channel Sales Manager, Austin TX - Verkada Inc)](cache://builtin/12).\n\nThe company primarily operates in the B2B sector, serving educational institutions, healthcare facilities, and various enterprises seeking robust security solutions. Verkada's products are distributed through a combination of direct sales and channel partners [(Verkada by Public Affairs)](https://www.verkada.com/tags/company-news/).\n\nVerkada has raised a total of $607 million in funding, with its most recent round in December 2024 securing $150 million. The company was valued at $3.2 billion as of September 2022, with notable investors including Sequoia Capital and Felicis Ventures [(Wikipedia, 2020)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkada) [(Tracxn, 2021)](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/verkada/__MabJwkKkg0oIExy7Z4aEaDyJpDpGhLgk1mfJDk_rdQA).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Filip Kaliszan**: CEO and co-founder, with a background in computer science from Stanford University. He previously worked at Chegg as Director of Product Management.\n  \n- **Hans Robertson**: Executive Chairman and co-founder, who co-founded Meraki and led it to a $1.2 billion acquisition by Cisco. He holds degrees in computer science from MIT.\n  \n- **James Ren**: Co-founder and software architect, with experience at Google and Chegg. He has degrees in computer science from Stanford and a juris doctorate from Harvard Law School.\n  \n- **Benjamin Bercovitz**: Co-founder, previously served as CTO at CourseRank and principal engineer at Chegg. He also holds degrees in computer science from Stanford.\n\nRecent leadership expansions include:\n\n- **Boudewijn Pesch**: Vice President of Japan and Asia-Pacific Channel Sales\n- **Marc Peston**: General Manager of Northern Europe\n- **Jonathon Dixon**: Vice President and Managing Director of Japan and Asia-Pacific\n- **Mauricio Ramirez**: Vice President of North America Corporate Enterprise Sales [(Verkada by Public Affairs)](https://www.verkada.com/tags/company-news/).\n\n# News\n\n## Product Developments\n\nIn September 2024, Verkada introduced AI-powered alerts, next-generation cameras, intercoms, and door readers at its annual event, VerkadaOne. The company also launched a mailroom product in August 2022 to help organizations track incoming packages [(Verkada by Public Affairs)](https://www.verkada.com/tags/company-news/) [(Wikipedia, 2020)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkada).\n\n## Controversies and Legal Issues\n\nVerkada has faced significant challenges, including a data breach in March 2021 that exposed sensitive information from over 150,000 cameras. This incident raised concerns about the company's security practices and led to a proposed settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in August 2024, which included a $3 million fine and mandated the implementation of a comprehensive information security program [(Privacy Perils Series: Verkada Case, 2024)](https://www.schwabe.com/publication/privacy-perils-what-went-wrong/) [(FTC Settlement: Explained)](https://www.verkada.com/blog/ftc-settlement-explained/).\n\nAdditionally, the company has been accused of misleading marketing practices, including false claims about its security measures and compliance with privacy regulations [(Privacy Perils Series: Verkada Case, 2024)](https://www.schwabe.com/publication/privacy-perils-what-went-wrong/).\n\n## Market Position\n\nVerkada is recognized as a leader in the cloud-based B2B physical security market, competing with companies like ADT, Ring Labs, and Alarm.com. The company has been ranked 8th among 878 active competitors in the security and surveillance technology sector [(Tracxn, 2021)](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/verkada/__MabJwkKkg0oIExy7Z4aEaDyJpDpGhLgk1mfJDk_rdQA).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVerkada Inc. has established itself as a significant player in the cloud-based security technology market, with a robust product offering and a growing customer base. However, the company must navigate ongoing legal challenges and improve its security practices to maintain its reputation and market position. Prospective candidates and investors should consider both the growth potential and the risks associated with Verkada's current operational landscape.",

The thumbnails that are returned through this endpoint are extracted from our cloud services as opposed to the camera itself. With that in mind, cameras will send a thumbnail every 20 seconds to our backend with an additional thumbnail sent if motion is detected during those 20 seconds. The thumbnail's associated timestamp will be as close as possible to the user-specified timestamp but may differ by up to 10 seconds (when no motion has been detected).\n\nThe call to the Get Thumbnail Image API endpoint returns the binary data of a JPEG image.

It was far behind the rest of the industry as far as features but priced as a high end solution that bricks if you decide you don’t want to pay licensing fees.  Pair that with multiple data breaches and a reputation for cutting out their own dealers to steal their customers…  they aren’t a good partner to the industry.\n\n## Comment ID lm5dxf8 with +1 score by [(Interesting-File-666, Reddit, 2024-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/accesscontrol/comments/1fayo1d/verkada/lm5dxf8/) (in reply to ID 1fayo1d):\nVerkada is expensive. But if you want to go with them my suggestion is starting from scratch and not doing a system transfer or upgrade. That means pay for the labor to pull all new wire to devices and demo the existing one. Doing this can actually save money in the long run. \nVerkada is easy to install and easy to program and use but only if the installer is the one doing the work from start to finish.\nTheir products are trash and half the time need to be returned and replaced once right out of the box so when a general bid is at 2 weeks it will probably be more like 3 because of all the random stuff going on.\nVerkada support is great because they are always available when you need them. But there is a disconnect between IT and the Installer/electrical side when trying to explain the issues that can arise. \nMake sure the network is also dedicated as there are many times when Verkada systems no longer connect with the network because it turns some systems (not all of them) need a dedicated network and some don’t. \nThere are pros and cons to every system. I’m personally not a fan of Verkada equipment and systems because they are cheap for the price being paid, and Axis can do all the same cloud based stuff with added controllers. So depends on what you want to do.\n\n## Comment ID lm9d4p7 with +1 score by [(Ok_Energy2010, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/accesscontrol/comments/1fayo1d/verkada/lm9d4p7/) (in reply to ID 1fayo1d):\nGo cloud based with Brivo & Eagle Eye Networks.

The opportunity for growth is limited with a lot of external leadership that care more about their reputation than the actual work. The ramp is extremely fast and it takes more than 2 years to build a territory to scratch. Fully ramped quotas are not sustainable unless you have a mature customers that's already standardized on Verkada. Verkada is an expensive solution where 60-70% of the market don't overspend on security. If you're stuck in a corporate territory with limited healthcare and manufacturing customers, good luck.",

The role primarily involves facilitating camera demonstrations rather than direct sales. The real selling is performed by partners, who manage site visits, in-person meetings, and other key activities. If assigned a less favorable territory, you may find it challenging to achieve your targets. Partners exert significant control over deals, and your role often involves merely checking in on deal status and providing updated quotes. Yes you are traveling to these territories as well its all paid for by the company, but most of the visits you are either kissing partners butts with lunch and dinners or begging customers for purchase orders. Thats what you 6 hour plane ride consists of, very degrading.\n\nWhile you can arrange meetings between partners and customers, your role is largely intermediary. Success in this position can be heavily influenced by territory and luck, as previous reps may have already exhausted key contacts. Meeting sales quotas often relies on renewals or deals brought in by partners rather than your own efforts. It’s also challenging to prospect new business due to prior outreach by other representatives. They don't explain this to you during interviews (but why would they, you probably wouldn't take the position) so the turnover rate is very high. People will not return to work. One day you'll see Fred or Sarah and then days and weeks will go by and you will never see them again. You will have to learn from other employees that Fred or Sarah was either fired for \"unknown\" reasons or they quit.\n\nIn some cases, individuals may achieve their quotas with minimal effort if they receive high-value deals from partners. Recognition is often given to those who benefit from such opportunities, even if their contribution to securing the deal was limited. The emphasis in this role is more on managing communications and relationships with partners rather than driving direct sales outcomes.\n\nIf you are on the cooperate side of the company, your quota first qtr can be as high as 100k-125k. Sled side is given a smaller quota, seeing as their deals take longer to come in, around 40k-60k. If you are looking to be promoted within these fields, they expect you to hit multiple times in a row on your quota, extremely unrealistic expectations.",

Regularly check in with teams, ensure workloads are manageable, and recognize employees’ contributions.\n\nImprove Communication: Establish clear communication channels across departments and ensure that expectations for each role are clearly defined. Transparent communication fosters trust and efficiency.\n\nRevamp Onboarding and Training: Provide a structured onboarding process for all departments, not just sales. Equip new hires with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed in their roles from day one.\n\nInvest in Leadership Development: Train managers to be effective leaders, not just task managers. Empathy, mentorship, and clear direction are key to a successful management team.\n\nEmbrace Diversity and Inclusion: Make a real commitment to diversity by actively hiring women, people of color, and individuals of varying ages. Cultivate a culture of inclusion where everyone can thrive, regardless of their background.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "My experience at this company has been overwhelmingly negative. The leadership, across all departments, shows little to no care for their employees. Although I wasn’t in sales, I worked closely with the Mid-Market and Enterprise teams, where the environment is stressful and the expectations are unreasonable. The teams face extremely high quotas, zero guidance, and absurd working hours.\n\nUnfortunately, the issues extend beyond the sales department. I've witnessed or heard concerning things from every corner of the organization. There is a sense of favoritism at the top, with many being friends or romantically involved. This creates an atmosphere where accountability is nonexistent, and it feels like there’s no safe place to voice concerns.\n\nEmployee wellbeing seems to be an afterthought. The company is focused solely on selling their product and making money, often at the expense of its people. Compensation is well below industry standards for most roles, and even long-term employees who meet or exceed expectations are rarely rewarded. Instead, they are often criticized or undermined.\n\nCommunication is a major issue here. There’s virtually no transparency when it comes to company-wide updates or information directly related to your role. Onboarding is minimal at best, especially for non-sales employees, leaving most people to figure things out on their own.\n\nThe management is poorly trained and often lacks the skills needed to lead effectively. The culture is cliquey and feels very much like a frat house environment. Despite claims of valuing diversity and inclusion, the company seems to actively avoid hiring women, people of color, or older candidates.",

It was a great shame for his managers to do this since he had helped solve almost all the critical issues for the product before its launch, and then he was suddenly let go. Some higher level people spoiled the EPMs for no reason, and one or two of these EPMs who was or is still on the team is the root cause of such toxic vibes. This includes, but is not limited to, talking behind someone's back and creating dramas. Another engineer left due to lack of supervision and mentoring, which is something you might expect when you join this company. If you are a fresh graduate. this is something you should really consider.",

        "cons": "If you are seeking a role that allows you to fully utilize your sales skills, this position may not align with your goals. The role primarily involves facilitating camera demonstrations rather than direct sales. The real selling is performed by partners, who manage site visits, in-person meetings, and other key activities. If assigned a less favorable territory, you may find it challenging to achieve your targets. Partners exert significant control over deals, and your role often involves merely checking in on deal status and providing updated quotes. Yes you are traveling to these territories as well its all paid for by the company, but most of the visits you are either kissing partners butts with lunch and dinners or begging customers for purchase orders. Thats what you 6 hour plane ride consists of, very degrading.\n\nWhile you can arrange meetings between partners and customers, your role is largely intermediary. Success in this position can be heavily influenced by territory and luck, as previous reps may have already exhausted key contacts. Meeting sales quotas often relies on renewals or deals brought in by partners rather than your own efforts. It’s also challenging to prospect new business due to prior outreach by other representatives. They don't explain this to you during interviews (but why would they, you probably wouldn't take the position) so the turnover rate is very high. People will not return to work. One day you'll see Fred or Sarah and then days and weeks will go by and you will never see them again. You will have to learn from other employees that Fred or Sarah was either fired for \"unknown\" reasons or they quit.\n\nIn some cases, individuals may achieve their quotas with minimal effort if they receive high-value deals from partners. Recognition is often given to those who benefit from such opportunities, even if their contribution to securing the deal was limited. The emphasis in this role is more on managing communications and relationships with partners rather than driving direct sales outcomes.\n\nIf you are on the cooperate side of the company, your quota first qtr can be as high as 100k-125k. Sled side is given a smaller quota, seeing as their deals take longer to come in, around 40k-60k.

Kaliszan, Ren, and Bercovitz had previously collaborated on CourseRank, a class data aggregation platform that was acquired by Chegg in 2010.[4]\n\nVerkada exited the beta development stage in September 2017, with a product offering of two camera models.\n\nIn 2019, Forbes included Verkada in its Next Billion Dollar Startups list, as well as that year's AI 50 list of most promising artificial intelligence companies.[5][6] In April, the company announced a $40 million Series B funding round, which valued the company at $540 million.[4]\n\nIn January 2020, the company raised $80 million in a Series C funding found led by Felicis Ventures, giving the company a $1.6 billion valuation.[2] In spring 2020, the company launched its first access control device, the first move in a shift to moving beyond cameras, and integrating security cameras and locks onto a single platform.[2] In June during the COVID-19 crisis Verkada instituted a program to offer free surveillance kits to businesses and healthcare institutions in order to remotely monitor high-risk locations.[7] It also added features to let customers detect when crowds are forming, and to identify high traffic areas that might need more cleaning.[8] In September, the company launched a line of integrated environmental sensors.[9] In September, it introduced a line of environmental sensors for facilities monitoring.[7]\n\nIn April 2021, news site Bloomberg News reported allegations by former employees accusing the company of having a \"bro\" culture, with lax device security, excessive focus on profit, and parties during the COVID-19 pandemic.[10] In the Bloomberg reporting, Verkada acknowledged an internal lapse in judgment, and was reportedly working to create a more inclusive work environment, including reviewing gender pay equity and implementing better training.[10] In September, the company began donating security cameras to Asian Pacific American business communities, starting with the Oakland California Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, to address growing anti-Asian threats and violence against its members.[11]\n\nIn August 2022, the company announced a mailroom product to help companies keep track of mail packages and shipments coming into their facilities.[12] In September, the company raised $205 million in Series D funding, bringing its valuation to $3.2 billion.[13] Despite the data breach it suffered in 2021, the company continued its expansion. In October 2023 it managed to close a $305 million funding round with participation from Lightspeed and shortly after the injection of $100 million by Alkeon Capital.[14]\n\nIn September 2024, Verkada was sued by the United States Department of Justice for violating the CAN-SPAM Act.[15]\n\nData breach\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 8, 2021, Verkada was hacked by an international group including maia arson crimew and calling themselves the \"APT - 69420 Arson Cats,\" which gained access to their network for about 36 hours and collected about 5 gigabytes of data.[16][failed verification]\n\nInitially, it was reported that the scope of the incident included live and recorded security camera footage from more than 150,000 cameras. It was later reported that 95 customers' video and images data were accessed[17][18][19] Crimew told Bloomberg News that the hack \"exposes just how broadly we're being surveilled\".[20]\n\nIn response to the data breach, in April 2021 it was reported that Verkada CEO Filip Kaliszan announced a series of measures, including red team/blue team exercises, a bug bounty program, mandatory two-factor authentication use by Verkada support staff, and the sharing of more audit logs with Verkada customers.[21]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2021, Motorola Solutions filed a 52-page complaint[22] against Verkada with the United States International Trade Commission, alleging that Verkada cameras and software infringe upon patents held by Motorola subsidiary Avigilon.[23][24] Verkada subsequently filed a lawsuit against Motorola Solutions in the California Northern District Court in September 2021,[25][26][27] arguing that Motorola has \"sought to effectively shut Verkada’s business down.\"[28][27] Later in September, the International Trade Commission initiated its investigation into Motorola's complaint,[29] with Verkada stating in its response that it does not infringe upon any of Motorola's patents.[30]\n\nOn October 24, 2022, the presiding administrative law judge (“ALJ”) of the ITC issued a final initial determination (“FID”) finding that a violation of section 337 has occurred, that Verkada's products infringed claims 6–11 of 1 of 3 patents asserted by Motorola, but no infringement with respect to the other asserted claims of the 1 patent and the claims of other 2 patents.[31] Both Verkada and Motorola filed for ITC review of the FID.[31] On April 4, 2023, ITC issued a final determination and terminated the ITC investigation, finding that Verkada products did not infringe any of Motorola's 3 patents.[31]\n\nVerkada uses facial recognition in its cameras, including systems installed in public housing. Independent testing showed a 15-85% false positive rate in the matches.[32] The use of surveillance cameras equipped with facial recognition technology ends up affecting the daily lives of residents in poor neighbourhoods and public housing areas[citation needed]. Their use makes their existence even more difficult and complicated, and there is no evidence of their usefulness in reducing crime.[32][33] Facial recognition has been outlawed in Illinois and Texas and has been under scrutiny by HUD.[32]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",
      "# [FTC Settlement: Explained](https://www.verkada.com/blog/ftc-settlement-explained/)\n",
      "# [Security cameras, CAN-SPAM, and “reasonable or appropriate security” by David Kessler (US), Susan Ross (US) on 2024-09-09](https://www.dataprotectionreport.com/2024/09/security-cameras-can-spam-and-reasonable-or-appropriate-security/)\nOn August 30, 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a proposed settlement with security camera manufacturer Verkada Inc., claiming Verkada committed a variety of unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and CAN-SPAM in connection with a security breach. (The U.S. Department of Justice filed that complaint and proposed stipulated joint order on behalf of the FTC.) Verkada does not admit or deny the claims (Order, para. 4).\n\nBackground\n\nAccording to the complaint, Verkada developed and sold security cameras and other surveillance products to businesses, including schools and medical facilities. Between 2019 and 2021, Verkada sold over 240,000 cameras, which were linked to Verkada’s platform, which enabled customers to have remote access to the cameras and stored surveillance footage. Verkada collected metadata about the security camera usage (including IP addresses and locations) as well as customer names, addresses, usernames and passwords, site floorplans, names of organizational contacts and Wi-Fi credentials.\n\nThe video cameras collected images of individuals, including patients and schoolchildren, as well as sensitive personal information (including medical records). The complaint states that Verkada offered its customers “People Analytics,” which allowed customers to search through video images collected for gender, clothing color, and/or to use facial recognition.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Verkada’s website made several claims about its security practices, including claims that it was HIPAA certified and compliant with the EU-US Privacy Shield. The complaint alleges the Verkada sent out large numbers of commercial emails, but did not include functional opt-out features, and also did not honor opt-outs it did receive. The complaint also claims that Verkada also did not include a clear and conspicuous opportunity to opt-out in emails and did not consistently include a physical postal address.\n\nParagraph 20 of the complaint asserts that Verkada did not take reasonable measures to secure the customer and consumer data, listing “Defendant’s information security failures” as follows:\n\na. Impose reasonable access management controls such as:\n\ni. requiring unique and complex passwords (i.e., long passwords not used by the individual for any other online service);\n\nii. enforcing role-based access controls to safeguard personal information, such as implementing the principle of least privilege and requiring multi-factor authentication for account access across all of Defendant’s systems;\n\niii. issuing alerts for activities, such as unsuccessful logins to administrative accounts and the addition or removal of any account with administrative privileges;\n\nb. Prevent data loss by establishing data protection controls, such as:\n\ni. performing data discovery and categorization for all sensitive personal information to ensure it is appropriately protected during transmission and storage;\n\nii. implementing a data loss prevention solution that monitors for suspicious activities such as unauthorized data access and exfiltration; and\n\niii. performing regular assessments to determine the effectiveness of protection measures;\n\nc. Implement centralized logging and alerting capabilities;\n\nd. Develop adequate security vulnerability management standards, policies, procedures, and practices such as:\n\ni. testing, auditing, assessing, or reviewing its products, or applications; security features; and\n\nii. conducting regular risk assessments, vulnerability scans, and penetration testing of its networks and databases;\n\ne. Implement secure network controls, such as disabling unnecessary ports, protocols, and services, and properly configuring firewall settings;\n\nf. Adequately encrypt customer’s data in transit or at rest; and\n\ng. Develop adequate written information security standards, policies, procedures, and practices; assess or enforce compliance with the written standards, policies, procedures, and practices that it did have; and implement training for employees (including engineers) regarding such standards, policies, procedures and practices.\n\nParagraph 3 of the complaint states that these “failures allowed a threat actor to access Defendant’s customer support accounts, view customer cameras, and access personal information relating to customers and consumers.”\n\nThe complaint included two counts of unfair information security practices in violation of § 5 of the FTC Act (one count for consumers and one for business customers); and five counts of deception in violation of § 5 (two counts of information security misrepresentations; one for HIPAA compliance misrepresentations; one for Privacy Shield misrepresentations; and two counts related to failure to disclose some online reviews were from individuals with “material connections” to Verkada and thus were not “impartial”). The complaint also included 3 counts relating to CAN-SPAM (failure to honor opt-outs; failure to provide notice of opt-out opportunity; and failure to provide physical postal address). CAN-SPAM includes civil penalties, and these formed the basis of the $2.95 million proposed settlement.\n\nThe proposed order contains many provisions similar to previous FTC settlements, but there are a few items that are particularly noteworthy:\n\n“Customer Information” [note this is not “consumer” information] includes not only user account credentials and email addresses, but also site floorplans, names and titles of customer contacts, Wi-Fi credentials; metadata about product usage and “access control elements, including access levels, access groups, and badge numbers.”\n\n“Personal information” includes not only names, addresses, and birthdates, but also live camera footage, video archives, still images or photos, and audio recordings.\n\nThe proposed order would last for 20 years and prohibits misrepresentations and violations of CAN-SPAM, and it would require that company implement an information security program (including someone responsible for overseeing it as well as multi-factor authentication), and third-party assessments. The proposed order contains an interesting prohibition on the third party assessor: “No finding of any Assessment shall rely primarily on assertions or attestations by Defendant’s management.”\n\nOur Take\n\nThere seems to be a trend developing among regulators, outlining the elements of “reasonable security.” This proposed judgment marks the third within two months that focuses on what is (or is not) “reasonable security.” The first settlement involved the New York Attorney General’s interpretation of New York’s SHIELD Act (see our write-up here); the second consent involved the California Attorney General’s requirements (involving Blackbaud, here); and this one is from the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nYet these three regulators, acting under very different laws, found that “reasonable security” includes all of the following elements, which certainly are not sufficient to demonstrate “reasonable security,” but all of which these regulators found to be necessary:\n\nDesignation of an individual in charge of the information security program\n\nEncryption of personal data,\n\nIntrusion detection and prevention;\n\nMulti-factor authentication,\n\nPassword management, and\n\nSegmentation/limiting access.\n\nAnd each proposed settlement included a multi-million-dollar payment.\n\nImportantly, here the FTC did not just focus on personal information of consumers, but confidential business information of Verkada’s customers. This expansion is a significant addition as breach notification laws focus entirely on personal information and, absent contract or affirmative representations, a victim of a security incident is not obligated to notify another business of the loss of their business information.",

      "# [Privacy Perils Series: Verkada Case on 2024-09-19](https://www.schwabe.com/publication/privacy-perils-what-went-wrong/)\nThe FTC’s recent enforcement action against a B2B company is a cautionary tale about ‎common, easy-to-avoid privacy, security, and marketing missteps; and a reminder that fines ‎aren’t the only consequences to fear in an enforcement action.‎\n\nIn addition to paying a $3M fine, for the next 20 years the FTC will require Verkada, Inc. to implement a comprehensive information security program, submit to third-party information security assessments, and comply with other robust administrative requirements to settle allegations that the company’s privacy, security, and marketing practices violated the law. To implement these obligations will require significant resources and investments. In the complaint filed by the Department of Justice at the FTC’s request, Verkada is alleged to have engaged in many unfair or deceptive business practices. Here are the top five, many of which are all too common:\n\nFailing to Adequately Protect Data. The complaint alleges that Verkada failed to provide reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect the personal information it collected and maintained, and that allowed a hacker to gain access to information from more than 150,000 live security cameras—including some in sensitive locations, such as psychiatric hospitals, women’s health clinics, children’s bedrooms, and prison cells. According to the complaint, reasonable and appropriate measures should have included:\n\nAccess management basics, such as the use of unique and complex passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication\n\nLogin monitoring to flag suspicious activities, such as unsuccessful logins to administrative accounts, and the addition or removal of any account with administrative privileges\n\nRegular risk assessments, vulnerability scans, and penetration testing\n\nTesting, auditing, and review of the effectiveness of security measures and services\n\nUse of encryption at rest and in transit, as well as network controls, such as properly configured firewalls\n\nDevelopment of adequate written information security standards, policies, procedures, and practices; and adequate training of employees on same\n\nMaking Misleading Statements about Data Protection Investments and Commitment. Verkada is alleged to have misrepresented its security practices in numerous ways. ‎First, their privacy policy claimed: “[W]e take customer privacy seriously” and “use best-in-class data security tools and best practices to keep your data safe.” Second, the company’s website purportedly contained misleading statements such as, “[f]rom Day 1, we’ve made technology decisions that strengthen security and … Verkada uses commercially reasonable efforts to deploy and uphold [] security best practices and standards….” Finally, in blog posts, press releases, and interviews, Verkada assured customers of the quality of its security practices and commitment to data protection. The complaint specifically references the following quote from Verkada’s CEO: “We built a system that’s end-to-end secure. That’s a huge problem with today’s systems. Verkada is secure out of the box.”\n\nMisrepresenting Privacy and Security Compliance. When Verkada marketed, promoted, advertised, and sold its products and services, the FTC claims the company frequently misrepresented it was (1) HIPAA-certified or compliant and (2) that it adhered to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield principles.\n\nSending Incessant Marketing Emails That Lacked Compliance Elements and Ignoring Customer Complaints. Verkada is alleged to have sent over 30 million promotional emails without an effective unsubscribe mechanism, and without including a valid, physical postal address in the body of the message. Email recipients repeatedly notified Verkada they didn’t want the emails, and they were unable to unsubscribe, despite multiple attempts.\n\nPosting Fake Reviews. Verkada employees and an investor purportedly violated FTC rules by posting positive online ratings and reviews without disclosing their relationship to the company or employee status, an activity which was at times encouraged. The complaint alleged that in June 2023, 35% of Google Maps ratings and reviews for Verkada were attributable to this practice, which FTC deems unlawful business.\n\nWhat are some better practices?\n\nImplement adequate security measures that take into account the types of information you process. Such measures should include technical, physical, and organizational controls designed to prevent unauthorized access to, use of, loss of, or alterations to information you process about consumers and businesses.\n\nTake stock of your data. Take inventory of the categories of personal information your company collects to ensure the information is processed lawfully. That may include analyzing many issues, such as whether personal information is being used for the purpose it was collected? Is it secured adequately, and what is the potential harm if it were disclosed improperly? How do data retention and deletion processes align with requirements and business needs?\n\nKnow Your Requirements. Ensure you understand your privacy and security obligations by identifying the laws and regulations that apply to your business, and revisit your assessments regularly, because data protection laws are proliferating.\n\nEnact policies and procedures that support your compliance needs. These could include conducting routine risk assessments and security testing, holding regular training for employees, and adopting written data practices and standards. It is common practice now to have a team and policy in place to respond to data privacy requests.\n\nBe aware of marketing pitfalls. CAN-SPAM was not on our 2024 Privacy Enforcement Bingo Card! While CAN-SPAM regulate many aspects of marketing, this enforcement action also serves as a great reminder of the many local, state, federal, and international laws that govern promotional communications (including texts and phone calls), digital advertising campaigns, and other common activities aimed to create brand awareness, generate leads, and increase demand.\n\nCommunicate Marketing Guardrails. If innovative marketing campaigns are key to your success, consider developing a marketing playbook or policy. This internal document is intended to clearly describe a company’s compliance obligations, outline prohibited activities, and establish processes and procedures to ensure the company is responsive to new rules, complaints, opt-out requests, customer concerns, and more. To provide a place to start, the FTC recently issued a final rule that addresses reviews and testimonials, and the FTC endorsement guides outline disclosure requirements in advertising.\n\nHave a Top-Notch Privacy Statement. Transparency can be an excellent risk mitigation strategy. Plus, companies often find that updating their privacy statement can expose significant risks. Those benefits are lost if the privacy statement contains privacy platitudes similar to those highlighted in the Verkada complaint. Many companies make a point to update their privacy statement at least annually to ensure that they are up to date.\n\nThe case is available here.\n\nThis article summarizes aspects of the law and does not constitute legal advice.

The company aims to provide organizations with real-time insights to enhance safety and operational efficiency [(AGC/DGC, Product Legal - Verkada Inc)](https://www.builtinsf.com/job/agcdgc-product-legal/212557).\n\n## Funding and Valuation\n\nVerkada has raised a total of $607 million in funding over multiple rounds, with its most recent funding round occurring in December 2024, where it secured $150 million. The company was valued at $3.2 billion as of September 2022 [(Wikipedia, 2020)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkada) [(Tracxn, 2021)](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/verkada/__MabJwkKkg0oIExy7Z4aEaDyJpDpGhLgk1mfJDk_rdQA).

Additionally, the company launched a mailroom product in August 2022 to help organizations track incoming packages [(Wikipedia, 2020)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkada).\n\n## Leadership Changes\n\nVerkada has recently expanded its leadership team, appointing several new executives to drive growth in various regions:\n\n- Boudewijn Pesch as Vice President of Japan and Asia-Pacific Channel Sales\n- Marc Peston as General Manager of Northern Europe\n- Jonathon Dixon as Vice President and Managing Director of Japan and Asia-Pacific\n- Mauricio Ramirez as Vice President of North America Corporate Enterprise Sales [(Verkada by Public Affairs)](https://www.verkada.com/tags/company-news/).\n\n## Controversies and Legal Issues\n\nVerkada has faced significant challenges, including a data breach in March 2021 that exposed sensitive information from over 150,000 cameras. The breach raised concerns about the company's security practices and led to a proposed settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in August 2024, which included a $3 million fine and mandated the implementation of a comprehensive information security program [(Privacy Perils Series: Verkada Case, 2024)](https://www.schwabe.com/publication/privacy-perils-what-went-wrong/) [(FTC Settlement: Explained)](https://www.verkada.com/blog/ftc-settlement-explained/).\n\nIn addition, the company has been accused of misleading marketing practices, including false claims about its security measures and compliance with privacy regulations [(Privacy Perils Series: Verkada Case, 2024)](https://www.schwabe.com/publication/privacy-perils-what-went-wrong/).\n\n## Market Position and Competitors\n\nVerkada is recognized as a leader in the cloud-based B2B physical security market, competing with companies like ADT, Ring Labs, and Alarm.com. The company has been ranked 8th among 878 active competitors in the security and surveillance technology sector [(Tracxn, 2021)](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/verkada/__MabJwkKkg0oIExy7Z4aEaDyJpDpGhLgk1mfJDk_rdQA).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVerkada Inc. has established itself as a significant player in the cloud-based security technology market, with a robust product offering and a growing customer base. However, the company must navigate ongoing legal challenges and improve its security practices to maintain its reputation and market position. Prospective candidates and investors should consider both the growth potential and the risks associated with Verkada's current operational landscape."
