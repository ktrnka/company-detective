These products are integrated into a single cloud-based platform, allowing for seamless management and monitoring [(Built In, 2024-12-13)](https://www.builtinaustin.com/job/channel-sales-manager-national-partners/4040067).\n\nThe company has raised over $650 million in funding, with a recent $200 million round valuing it at approximately $4.5 billion [(Bloomberg, 2024-12-13)](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/12/13/security-camera-startup-verkada-in-talks-for-45-billion-valuation/). Verkada's revenue details are not explicitly mentioned, but the scale of its operations and funding suggests significant financial growth.\n\nVerkada distributes its products through direct sales and offers a free 30-day trial for new customers, which includes cloud-based cameras, technical support, and shipping [(Enterprise Security System)](https://www.verkada.com/bm/).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Filip Kaliszan**: CEO and co-founder, with a background in computer science from Stanford University.

This is part of a broader trend, as the company has raised over $650 million in total funding [(Bloomberg, 2024-12-13)](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/12/13/security-camera-startup-verkada-in-talks-for-45-billion-valuation/).\n\n### Product Innovations\n\nAt the VerkadaOne event, the company introduced AI-powered alerts, expanded integrations, and next-generation cameras, intercoms, and door readers. Verkada currently offers six product lines, all integrated into a single cloud-based platform [(Verkada by Public Affairs, 2024-09-30)](https://www.verkada.com/tags/company-news/).\n\n### Partnerships and Community Engagement\n\nVerkada has partnered with Safe and Sound Schools to enhance safety in educational environments and has engaged in community initiatives, such as donating security cameras to Asian Pacific American business communities [(Verkada by Public Affairs, 2024-09-30)](https://www.verkada.com/tags/company-news/).\n\n## Controversies and Legal Challenges\n\n### Data Breach and FTC Settlement\n\nIn March 2021, Verkada experienced a significant data breach that exposed live camera feeds from over 150,000 cameras. The FTC imposed a $2.95 million fine on Verkada for inadequate security measures and misleading customers about its security practices. The settlement requires Verkada to implement a comprehensive information security program and submit to third-party assessments for 20 years [(FTC Penalizes Cloud-Based Physical Security Company, 2024-09-30)](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/blogs/wilmerhale-privacy-and-cybersecurity-law/20240930-ftc-penalizes-cloudbased-physical-security-company-for-data-security-and-canspam-violations).\n\n### Legal Disputes\n\nVerkada faced a lawsuit from Motorola Solutions alleging patent infringement, which was resolved in favor of Verkada in April 2023. The company has also been scrutinized for its use of facial recognition technology, raising privacy concerns and leading to legal restrictions in certain states [(Wikipedia, 2020-08-21)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkada).\n\nIn conclusion, Verkada Inc. is a rapidly growing player in the cloud-based physical security market, with a strong focus on innovation and community engagement. However, the company faces significant challenges, including past data breaches and ongoing scrutiny regarding its security practices. Prospective candidates and investors should weigh these factors carefully, considering both the company's growth potential and the risks associated with its operational history.",

Examples: Video intercom does not show who is at the door until you answer it (defeats the whole purpose & video doorbells under $100 do this!). There is no distinct ringtone for the door intercoms, so when someone presses the doorbell, you have to find out which door they are at. Notifications are a mess. No picture is shown (except in text messages). You can’t easily mute the notifications. The notifications are not according to Apple’s standard. You need a license for everything & they are expensive! You need a separate AppleTV to view the video feeds as their previous iPad app is deprecated. There is no Apple Watch app (which would be so helpful!). There was no helpful introduction or setting up of devices. No developer response to Apple Store complaints. No Face ID for security so you have to keep logging in. I could name 100 things that are missing or poorly implemented. A greatly missed opportunity.",

The hardware is very good, but the software has so many holes. We spent tens of thousands of dollars on this and are disappointed. Examples: Video intercom does not show who is at the door until you answer it (defeats the whole purpose & video doorbells under $100 do this!). There is no distinct ringtone for the door intercoms, so when someone presses the doorbell, you have to find out which door they are at. Notifications are a mess. No picture is shown (except in text messages). You can’t easily mute the notifications. The notifications are not according to Apple’s standard. You need a license for everything & they are expensive! You need a separate AppleTV to view the video feeds as their previous iPad app is deprecated. There is no Apple Watch app (which would be so helpful!). There was no helpful introduction or setting up of devices. No developer response to Apple Store complaints. No Face ID for security so you have to keep logging in. I could name 100 things that are missing or poorly implemented. A greatly missed opportunity.",

      "# Post ID 1ishti8: Verkada/Cloud Camera Stream Solution? with +7 score by [(AverageDataAdmin, Reddit, 2025-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/k12sysadmin/comments/1ishti8/verkadacloud_camera_stream_solution/)\nOur district recently switched from analog cameras to a Verkada cloud based system. Is there a good way to have all cameras streaming to 1 or 2 devices (120 camera streams or so)?\n\nWe have a \"security room\" in which administration wants all camera feeds to be displaying all at one time in the event of a lockdown situation so that someone can run in, close the door, and see what is going on through the cameras. For this to work, they want all camera feeds to be constantly streamed on the device(s) in this room.\n\nI have 2 desktops set up with 5 screens connected to each. With Verkada's online platform, I can put 12 streams on each screen. The problem is that since it is a web based application after a few hours, Chrome (or Edge, or Firefox) will crash due to running out of memory. Each PC has 32 GB of RAM, just as an FYI.\n\n Is there a good way to get this to work? Are there any type of dedicated devices on the market just to view IP camera streams? They get frustrated if it crashes and they have to manually open up the browsers (even though it goes right to the page they need and signs in automatically). Verkada sells a \"security system\", but they don't want to fork out the money for it, plus it only allows 30 streams per \"page\" and so admin would have to scroll to see all the feeds and they want to just be able to view all of them all at the same time.\n\n  \nAny thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated!\n\n## Comment ID mdgn80o with +22 score by [(ZaMelonZonFire, Reddit, 2025-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/k12sysadmin/comments/1ishti8/verkadacloud_camera_stream_solution/mdgn80o/) (in reply to ID 1ishti8):\nAs much as Verkada costs, it should not only do what you’re asking, it should make you coffee.   \n\nI’ve blocked all their emails and sales attempts.\n\n### Comment ID mdgoulg with +2 score by [(AverageDataAdmin, Reddit, 2025-02-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/k12sysadmin/comments/1ishti8/verkadacloud_camera_stream_solution/mdgoulg/) (in reply to ID mdgn80o):\nYou're telling me!

Youre essentially locked into their ecosystem unless you want hundreds of bricks in your district (since unless they go out of business ONVIF is locked essentially forcing you to Verkada). I get the want for cloud based and ditching on prem devices but there are way better options. Avigilon Alta is a solid option. They support Alta mode which is connected to their cloud platform only OR can be used with ONVIF based NVRs.

It was far behind the rest of the industry as far as features but priced as a high end solution that bricks if you decide you don’t want to pay licensing fees.  Pair that with multiple data breaches and a reputation for cutting out their own dealers to steal their customers…  they aren’t a good partner to the industry.\n\n## Comment ID lm5dxf8 with +1 score by [(Interesting-File-666, Reddit, 2024-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/accesscontrol/comments/1fayo1d/verkada/lm5dxf8/) (in reply to ID 1fayo1d):\nVerkada is expensive. But if you want to go with them my suggestion is starting from scratch and not doing a system transfer or upgrade. That means pay for the labor to pull all new wire to devices and demo the existing one. Doing this can actually save money in the long run. \nVerkada is easy to install and easy to program and use but only if the installer is the one doing the work from start to finish.\nTheir products are trash and half the time need to be returned and replaced once right out of the box so when a general bid is at 2 weeks it will probably be more like 3 because of all the random stuff going on.\nVerkada support is great because they are always available when you need them. But there is a disconnect between IT and the Installer/electrical side when trying to explain the issues that can arise. \nMake sure the network is also dedicated as there are many times when Verkada systems no longer connect with the network because it turns some systems (not all of them) need a dedicated network and some don’t. \nThere are pros and cons to every system. I’m personally not a fan of Verkada equipment and systems because they are cheap for the price being paid, and Axis can do all the same cloud based stuff with added controllers. So depends on what you want to do.\n\n## Comment ID lm9d4p7 with +1 score by [(Ok_Energy2010, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/accesscontrol/comments/1fayo1d/verkada/lm9d4p7/) (in reply to ID 1fayo1d):\nGo cloud based with Brivo & Eagle Eye Networks.

Examples: Video intercom does not show who is at the door until you answer it (defeats the whole purpose & video doorbells under $100 do this!). There is no distinct ringtone for the door intercoms, so when someone presses the doorbell, you have to find out which door they are at. Notifications are a mess. No picture is shown (except in text messages). You can’t easily mute the notifications. The notifications are not according to Apple’s standard. You need a license for everything & they are expensive! You need a separate AppleTV to view the video feeds as their previous iPad app is deprecated. There is no Apple Watch app (which would be so helpful!). There was no helpful introduction or setting up of devices. No developer response to Apple Store complaints. No Face ID for security so you have to keep logging in. I could name 100 things that are missing or poorly implemented. A greatly missed opportunity.",

Corporate teams are also facing challenges, with only 13% of reps in my office hitting quota.\n\nA key factor contributing to this is the decision to structure mid-market around companies with fewer than 500 employees. Our product is positioned and priced as an enterprise solution, yet we are pushing it on businesses that may not have the budget or operational need for it. Even Verkada acknowledges this, as seen at SKO, where our CRO emphasized a shift toward enterprise sales and adjusted sales plays to penetrate larger accounts.\n\nAdditionally, the quota structure is fundamentally misaligned with market realities. Regardless of location or historical performance, every rep is assigned the same quota. For example, if a territory historically generates $50K per year, the expectation remains $350K per quarter. Even if a rep doubles their territory’s year-over-year revenue—an objectively strong outcome—it holds no weight if they don’t meet quota. Logical, data-driven quota setting would address this misalignment, but I don’t foresee that changing anytime soon.",

I highly reccommend considering this program if you are looking to start your career in tech sales at a hyper growth, pre IPO company with an exceptional product and fast-track to a closing role. Not only will you get the opportunity to interview for a closing position after ~6 months in the AAE program, but you will be equipped with immense knowledge of the full sales cycle, product lines, and get real customer facing experience to help you succeed right off the bat when you become an AE. AAE's notoriously are top performers when they become AEs due to the strategic design and structure of the AAE program which gives you every tool you need and more to start a successful sales career at Verkada. There is no sales development program out there that equips its members for more success than this one.

Quotas only based on seniority level without taking the territory the reps are covering or historical data in mind\n\nI would never recommend that an experience AE work at this company. The leadership is awful, misguided, and inexperienced. They don't care about the actual skillset or experience their reps have. So many partners and companies have a bad taste in their mouth from bad experiences with this company, which makes it nearly impossible to foster relationships or expand your book of business in a timely manner. Recruiters and leadership will also lie to you about how well the office is doing and the ability to attain OTE. Only 32% of reps in this office are attainting over 50%, and I can't imagine how much worse other offices are doing . Churn is absolutely insane because those who are attaining over 50% have very lucrative zip codes with deals fed to them from leadership and/or pre-existing relationships. Your actual skillset does not make a difference at this company as far as performance or recognition. Stay away if you care about your career and making money long-term.\n\nI also need to add that this is the only company I have ever worked for where sexism is abundantly clear. From men clearly objectifying women, to women not being treated fairly when it comes to evaluations and lead distribution. I witnessed women being affected by this firsthand, and let me tell you HR is NOT on your side. Women beware.",

Imagine Wolf of Wall Street but in real life lol\n- Their sales tactics are worse than car salesmen. They'll end up giving 70% discounts at EOQs just to pump up numbers - which takes more off your commission and total revenue\n- There's probably 1 or 2 good, ethical sales managers. One sales manager got caught up bribing his client. A few of their corp and SLED clients want you to bribe them so they can have a peice of your commission. \n\nAgain, this place is only for kids out of college and people that used to sell Verkada as an IT partner.

Hearing and acting on employee input builds trust and ensures the company continues to grow together.",

While I heard everything from rave reviews to damning critiques, the general sentiment seemed to be that they offered an amazing product, but had a questionable culture. This combined with the fact that I was quite content with my current company at the time was enough to deter me. Fast-forward a few years, an opportunity arose and I took the risk; leaving my cushy job at a well-established company to join a startup with a questionable reputation. After nearly 3 years, my only regret is I didn’t make the move sooner. Verkada is absolutely littered with top talent across all departments and they’re truly building something special (that’s not just the Kool-Aid talking).",

The opportunity for growth is limited with a lot of external leadership that care more about their reputation than the actual work. The ramp is extremely fast and it takes more than 2 years to build a territory to scratch. Fully ramped quotas are not sustainable unless you have a mature customers that's already standardized on Verkada.

Fully ramped quotas are not sustainable unless you have a mature customers that's already standardized on Verkada.

This combined with the fact that I was quite content with my current company at the time was enough to deter me. Fast-forward a few years, an opportunity arose and I took the risk; leaving my cushy job at a well-established company to join a startup with a questionable reputation. After nearly 3 years, my only regret is I didn’t make the move sooner.

One sales manager got caught up bribing his client. A few of their corp and SLED clients want you to bribe them so they can have a peice of your commission. \n\nAgain, this place is only for kids out of college and people that used to sell Verkada as an IT partner.

Not only will you get the opportunity to interview for a closing position after ~6 months in the AAE program, but you will be equipped with immense knowledge of the full sales cycle, product lines, and get real customer facing experience to help you succeed right off the bat when you become an AE. AAE's notoriously are top performers when they become AEs due to the strategic design and structure of the AAE program which gives you every tool you need and more to start a successful sales career at Verkada. There is no sales development program out there that equips its members for more success than this one. The AAE management team is excellent and if you do get the opportunity to ever work under Erika Becker and Christina Chace you shouldn't miss out on having amazing leaders who are truly invested in your growth and success.",

The leadership is awful, misguided, and inexperienced. They don't care about the actual skillset or experience their reps have. So many partners and companies have a bad taste in their mouth from bad experiences with this company, which makes it nearly impossible to foster relationships or expand your book of business in a timely manner. Recruiters and leadership will also lie to you about how well the office is doing and the ability to attain OTE. Only 32% of reps in this office are attainting over 50%, and I can't imagine how much worse other offices are doing . Churn is absolutely insane because those who are attaining over 50% have very lucrative zip codes with deals fed to them from leadership and/or pre-existing relationships.

Even Verkada acknowledges this, as seen at SKO, where our CRO emphasized a shift toward enterprise sales and adjusted sales plays to penetrate larger accounts.\n\nAdditionally, the quota structure is fundamentally misaligned with market realities. Regardless of location or historical performance, every rep is assigned the same quota. For example, if a territory historically generates $50K per year, the expectation remains $350K per quarter. Even if a rep doubles their territory’s year-over-year revenue—an objectively strong outcome—it holds no weight if they don’t meet quota. Logical, data-driven quota setting would address this misalignment, but I don’t foresee that changing anytime soon.",

If you are looking for something that is really going to push you to be your best and learn a lot, it is great place to start your career.

      "# [Wikipedia by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2020-08-21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkada)\nCloud-based physical security startup\n\nVerkada Inc. is an American security technology company, based in San Mateo, California. The company combines security equipment such as video cameras, access control systems and environmental sensors, with cloud based machine vision and artificial intelligence.[2][3]\n\nThe company was founded in 2016.[4] In 2021, it was the target of a data breach that accessed security camera footage and private data.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nVerkada Inc. was founded in 2016 in Menlo Park, California by three Stanford University graduates: Filip Kaliszan, James Ren, and Benjamin Bercovitz, who were joined by Hans Robertson, co-founder and former COO of Meraki (now Cisco Meraki). Kaliszan, Ren, and Bercovitz had previously collaborated on CourseRank, a class data aggregation platform that was acquired by Chegg in 2010.[4]\n\nVerkada exited the beta development stage in September 2017, with a product offering of two camera models.\n\nIn 2019, Forbes included Verkada in its Next Billion Dollar Startups list, as well as that year's AI 50 list of most promising artificial intelligence companies.[5][6] In April, the company announced a $40 million Series B funding round, which valued the company at $540 million.[4]\n\nIn January 2020, the company raised $80 million in a Series C funding found led by Felicis Ventures, giving the company a $1.6 billion valuation.[2] In spring 2020, the company launched its first access control device, the first move in a shift to moving beyond cameras, and integrating security cameras and locks onto a single platform.[2] In June during the COVID-19 crisis Verkada instituted a program to offer free surveillance kits to businesses and healthcare institutions in order to remotely monitor high-risk locations.[7] It also added features to let customers detect when crowds are forming, and to identify high traffic areas that might need more cleaning.[8] In September, the company launched a line of integrated environmental sensors.[9] In September, it introduced a line of environmental sensors for facilities monitoring.[7]\n\nIn April 2021, news site Bloomberg News reported allegations by former employees accusing the company of having a \"bro\" culture, with lax device security, excessive focus on profit, and parties during the COVID-19 pandemic.[10] In the Bloomberg reporting, Verkada acknowledged an internal lapse in judgment, and was reportedly working to create a more inclusive work environment, including reviewing gender pay equity and implementing better training.[10] In September, the company began donating security cameras to Asian Pacific American business communities, starting with the Oakland California Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, to address growing anti-Asian threats and violence against its members.[11]\n\nIn August 2022, the company announced a mailroom product to help companies keep track of mail packages and shipments coming into their facilities.[12] In September, the company raised $205 million in Series D funding, bringing its valuation to $3.2 billion.[13] Despite the data breach it suffered in 2021, the company continued its expansion. In October 2023 it managed to close a $305 million funding round with participation from Lightspeed and shortly after the injection of $100 million by Alkeon Capital.[14]\n\nIn September 2024, Verkada was sued by the United States Department of Justice for violating the CAN-SPAM Act.[15]\n\nData breach\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 8, 2021, Verkada was hacked by an international group including maia arson crimew and calling themselves the \"APT - 69420 Arson Cats,\" which gained access to their network for about 36 hours and collected about 5 gigabytes of data.[16][failed verification]\n\nInitially, it was reported that the scope of the incident included live and recorded security camera footage from more than 150,000 cameras. It was later reported that 95 customers' video and images data were accessed[17][18][19] Crimew told Bloomberg News that the hack \"exposes just how broadly we're being surveilled\".[20]\n\nIn response to the data breach, in April 2021 it was reported that Verkada CEO Filip Kaliszan announced a series of measures, including red team/blue team exercises, a bug bounty program, mandatory two-factor authentication use by Verkada support staff, and the sharing of more audit logs with Verkada customers.[21]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2021, Motorola Solutions filed a 52-page complaint[22] against Verkada with the United States International Trade Commission, alleging that Verkada cameras and software infringe upon patents held by Motorola subsidiary Avigilon.[23][24] Verkada subsequently filed a lawsuit against Motorola Solutions in the California Northern District Court in September 2021,[25][26][27] arguing that Motorola has \"sought to effectively shut Verkada’s business down.\"[28][27] Later in September, the International Trade Commission initiated its investigation into Motorola's complaint,[29] with Verkada stating in its response that it does not infringe upon any of Motorola's patents.[30]\n\nOn October 24, 2022, the presiding administrative law judge (“ALJ”) of the ITC issued a final initial determination (“FID”) finding that a violation of section 337 has occurred, that Verkada's products infringed claims 6–11 of 1 of 3 patents asserted by Motorola, but no infringement with respect to the other asserted claims of the 1 patent and the claims of other 2 patents.[31] Both Verkada and Motorola filed for ITC review of the FID.[31] On April 4, 2023, ITC issued a final determination and terminated the ITC investigation, finding that Verkada products did not infringe any of Motorola's 3 patents.[31]\n\nVerkada uses facial recognition in its cameras, including systems installed in public housing. Independent testing showed a 15-85% false positive rate in the matches.[32] The use of surveillance cameras equipped with facial recognition technology ends up affecting the daily lives of residents in poor neighbourhoods and public housing areas[citation needed]. Their use makes their existence even more difficult and complicated, and there is no evidence of their usefulness in reducing crime.[32][33] Facial recognition has been outlawed in Illinois and Texas and has been under scrutiny by HUD.[32]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",
      "# [FTC Penalizes Cloud-Based Physical Security Company for Data Security and CAN-SPAM Violations by Kirk J. Nahra, Ali A. Jessani, Sarah Litwin on 2024-09-30](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/blogs/wilmerhale-privacy-and-cybersecurity-law/20240930-ftc-penalizes-cloudbased-physical-security-company-for-data-security-and-canspam-violations)\nOn August 30, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) entered into a proposed settlement order with cloud-based physical security solutions provider, Verkada Inc. (“Verkada”), settling allegations of data security violations and mandating a record monetary payment (of $2.95 million) to remedy separate allegations of unlawful email marketing practices in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act. The agency’s case against Verkada stemmed from the business’s alleged failure to use appropriate information security practices, which the agency claimed allowed a hacker to access customers’ security cameras and sensitive personal information about consumers, as a result. This action also alleged that Verkada misrepresented its security practices, as well as its compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) rules and with Privacy Shield.\n\nThis settlement is notable for a few reasons. First, it shows that – while the FTC is focused on creating new substantive security and privacy obligations for entities through its ability to enforce “unfair” violations under Section 5 of the FTC Act – it is still looking to enforce the older privacy laws that fall within its jurisdiction (such as CAN-SPAM). The FTC is also actively looking to bring enforcement actions against companies where an alleged privacy or security violation leads to the potential compromise of sensitive data. Finally, the agency still cares about the representations company’s make about their security compliance, especially if those representations relate to compliance with a formal security program (such as the security requirements mandated by HIPAA). It is also notable for companies that the FTC is continuing to enforce historic compliance efforts with Privacy Shield, even though the program has been replaced by the Data Privacy Framework.\n\nIn this article, we summarize the agency’s complaint and order against Verkada and identify key takeaways from the decision. To stay up to date on the latest state privacy law developments, please subscribe to the WilmerHale Privacy and Cybersecurity Law Blog.\n\nI.Summary of the Complaint\n\nVerkada is a developer of physical security solutions that include video security cameras, door locks, and panic buttons, among other products, as well as a cloud-based software platform to manage them. The company sells these solutions to over 26,000 organizations today, including office buildings, warehouses, retail stores, healthcare facilities, and schools. Some of Verkada’s customers deploy the products in sensitive areas that implicate privacy concerns (such as schools and psychiatric hospitals).\n\nIn its complaint, the FTC alleged Verkada engaged in (i) multiple data security practices and failures that resulted in repeated risk of consumer data exposure and led to cybersecurity intrusions. The agency also charged Verkada with engaging in other deceptive and unfair practices including (ii) misrepresenting its security practices to consumers, (iii) misrepresenting alleged HIPAA certification and Privacy Shield compliance, (iv) failing to disclose the association or employment relationship of certain individuals who posted positive ratings and reviews about Verkada and its products online, and (v) failing to include provide consumers with an option to unsubscribe or opt-out, honor opt-out requests, and provide a physical postal address in emails.\n\nThe FTC explained the following was considered to be an unfair or deceptive practices in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act:\n\nFailure to Safeguard Personal Information\n\nThe FTC asserted that Verkada failed to safeguard customers’ and consumers’ personal information collected through the company’s security cameras. Specifically, the agency claimed that Verkada failed to impose reasonable access management controls including strong password authentication, role-based access controls, and issue alerts for activities such as incorrect logins to administrative accounts or removal of privileges for accounts. In addition, according to the complaint, the company failed to establish data loss protection or perform data discovery and categorization for all sensitive personal information or regular assessments to determine the effectiveness of protection measures. Verkada also allegedly had no centralized logging and alerting capabilities, nor did it conduct regular risk assessments, vulnerability scans, or penetration testing of its networks and databases. Lastly, the FTC’s complaint asserted that the company failed to assess or enforce compliance of its written information security standards and policies. According to the FTC, these combined failures allowed an unauthorized actor to hack into Verkada’s platform in March 2021, gaining access to security camera footage a limited number of customers.\n\nThe agency sought redress for what it claimed was a substantial injury to consumers in the form of exposure of their personal information and by the invasion of their privacy, especially for those in sensitive settings such as hospital rooms and schools.\n\nSecurity Misrepresentations\n\nThe agency scrutinized Verkada’s representations about its information security practices and considered them to be false and misleading. In a 2018 press release, Verkada reassured customers of the strength of its security products, stating “Verkada offers a range of benefits, including stronger data security…” The complaint also referenced the company’s webpage, which made numerous claims regarding information security practices.\n\nAccording to the FTC, Verkada made multiple misleading statements such as “Verkada devices are compliant against some of the strictest data handling and security standards in the world” and Verkada was “[f]ully HIPAA compliant” (when, in fact, Verkada’s products were not).\n\nThe FTC’s complaint also found issues with Verkada’s representation that it was Privacy Shield certified. Though no longer in effect as a valid data transfer mechanism for personal data from the EU to the US, companies that were previously registered under Privacy Shield are still responsible for the promises they made at the time related to their certification. In this case, the FTC was focused on this specific Privacy Shield principle:\n\n“SECURITY [Principle 4]: (a) Organizations creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating personal information must take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect it from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal data.”\n\nThe agency contended that Verkada made multiple false statements, including written statements that Verkada achieved the Privacy Shield certification on its web page as of December 2022.\n\nFalse and Misleading Online Reviews\n\nAccording to the complaint, individuals associated with Verkada wrote online reviews on the company’s Google Maps profile without disclosing their relationship to the company. The agency claimed that Verkada was aware of these reviews and that they omitted the reviewers’ ties to the company (including a venture capital investor of Verkada). The FTC’s complaint further asserted that Verkada had encouraged some employees to post these reviews.\n\nCAN-SPAM Violations\n\nThe complaint further alleges that Verkada failed to honor opt-out requests, provide notice of opt-out requests or a valid physical postal address in its email marketing communications. At issue is that Verkada’s email marketing campaigns failed to abide by the CAN-SPAM Act, a 2004 law protecting consumers from unfair email marketing tactics. The CAN-SPAM Act also makes it illegal to initiate email marketing without a clear and conspicuous opt-out. The law forces companies to honor opt-out requests within 10-business days after receipt of such a request, which Verkada allegedly failed to do.\n\nII.Stipulated Order\n\nUnder the stipulated order, Verkada was required to pay a $2.95 million monetary fine for the alleged CAN-SPAM violations, the highest monetary penalty ever for a CAN-SPAM violation. Verkada also agreed to the following terms in the order:\n\nPermanent Injunction of Data Security Practices\n\nA prohibition against misrepresentations concerning privacy, security, confidentiality of consumer data, compliance programs including HIPAA compliance, independence of endorser or reviewers of a business product or service.\n\nA Requirement to Implement a Comprehensive Privacy Program\n\nFollowing the trend in other recent FTC orders, Verkada is required to develop and implement a comprehensive information security program with biennial third-party oversight for 20 years. To safeguard personal information and customer information, the program must be documented in writing, provided to the board of directors or equivalent governing body, and overseen by a designated qualified employee. Independent third-party assessors will annually review the program’s effectiveness. Furthermore, material program evaluations or updates are required within 30 days of a covered incident. A covered incident occurs when information of or about an individual consumer was, or is reasonably believed to have been, accessed, acquired, or publicly exposed without authorization. After a covered incident, Verkada will submit a report to the Federal Trade Commission within 10 days.\n\nThe order also requires all employees to complete annual mandatory training on how to safeguard personal information and customer information. Verkada will be required to implement controls monitoring its networks to identify and respond to anomalous activity and unauthorized attempts to access or exfiltrate personal information and customer data. Verkada has agreed to provide the agency with annual updates of its satisfaction with the order requirements for 20 years.\n\nEnjoined from Unlawful Commercial Email Practices\n\nFinally, the order prohibits Verkada from violating Section 5 of the CAN-SPAM Act, or otherwise not complying with the requirements to provide a physical post address, provide a notice for consumers to decline to receive email messages, and honor email opt-out requests in connection with email marketing or advertising.\n\nIII.Key Takeaways\n\n1. The FTC continues to enforce data security violations.\n\nWhile many of the FTC’s recent enforcement actions have focused on “privacy” violations (e.g., the disclosure of sensitive data to third parties for advertising purposes), this decision shows that the FTC isn’t turning a blind eye to security violations, especially if the inadequate security leads to a data breach. Companies should pay attention to recent FTC settlement orders regarding data security and assess whether their practices live up to the FTC’s expectations, as well as to the promises they are making to consumers about their security. This latter point is especially important if a company is claiming to adhere to a specific security standard, such as the HIPAA Security Rule.\n\n2. The FTC will continue to focus its enforcement actions where a company’s data practices potentially lead to the compromise of sensitive data.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the FTC targeted a company that provides products with access to personal information from privacy-sensitive facilities, such as psychiatric hospitals and women’s health clinics. Through this order, the FTC adds insight into what the agency considers to be sensitive information that merits heightened protection. According to the agreed to information security program requirements, the appropriate level of data protection should be based on “the volume and sensitivity of the data at risk.” In this case, the FTC contends allowing a hacker to access internet-connected security cameras and view patients in psychiatric hospitals and women’s health clinics evidenced a failure to safeguard particularly sensitive information.\n\n3. CAN-SPAM still matters.\n\nThis is the FTC’s third CAN-SPAM related enforcement action or lawsuit in the last two years. While the agency hasn’t historically focused its attention on the law, this recent trend may indicate that this is becoming an area of focus for the agency. Companies should closely review their email marketing practices in light of these actions.\n\n4. Privacy Shield also (still) matters.\n\nPrivacy Shield being replaced by the Data Privacy Framework isn’t stopping the FTC from enforcing the historical promises companies made under the old data transfer framework. Companies should keep this in mind as a potential enforcement risk.",
      "# [Security cameras, CAN-SPAM, and “reasonable or appropriate security” by David Kessler (US), Susan Ross (US) on 2024-09-09](https://www.dataprotectionreport.com/2024/09/security-cameras-can-spam-and-reasonable-or-appropriate-security/)\nOn August 30, 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a proposed settlement with security camera manufacturer Verkada Inc., claiming Verkada committed a variety of unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and CAN-SPAM in connection with a security breach. (The U.S. Department of Justice filed that complaint and proposed stipulated joint order on behalf of the FTC.) Verkada does not admit or deny the claims (Order, para. 4).\n\nBackground\n\nAccording to the complaint, Verkada developed and sold security cameras and other surveillance products to businesses, including schools and medical facilities. Between 2019 and 2021, Verkada sold over 240,000 cameras, which were linked to Verkada’s platform, which enabled customers to have remote access to the cameras and stored surveillance footage. Verkada collected metadata about the security camera usage (including IP addresses and locations) as well as customer names, addresses, usernames and passwords, site floorplans, names of organizational contacts and Wi-Fi credentials.\n\nThe video cameras collected images of individuals, including patients and schoolchildren, as well as sensitive personal information (including medical records). The complaint states that Verkada offered its customers “People Analytics,” which allowed customers to search through video images collected for gender, clothing color, and/or to use facial recognition.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Verkada’s website made several claims about its security practices, including claims that it was HIPAA certified and compliant with the EU-US Privacy Shield. The complaint alleges the Verkada sent out large numbers of commercial emails, but did not include functional opt-out features, and also did not honor opt-outs it did receive. The complaint also claims that Verkada also did not include a clear and conspicuous opportunity to opt-out in emails and did not consistently include a physical postal address.\n\nParagraph 20 of the complaint asserts that Verkada did not take reasonable measures to secure the customer and consumer data, listing “Defendant’s information security failures” as follows:\n\na. Impose reasonable access management controls such as:\n\ni. requiring unique and complex passwords (i.e., long passwords not used by the individual for any other online service);\n\nii. enforcing role-based access controls to safeguard personal information, such as implementing the principle of least privilege and requiring multi-factor authentication for account access across all of Defendant’s systems;\n\niii. issuing alerts for activities, such as unsuccessful logins to administrative accounts and the addition or removal of any account with administrative privileges;\n\nb. Prevent data loss by establishing data protection controls, such as:\n\ni. performing data discovery and categorization for all sensitive personal information to ensure it is appropriately protected during transmission and storage;\n\nii. implementing a data loss prevention solution that monitors for suspicious activities such as unauthorized data access and exfiltration; and\n\niii. performing regular assessments to determine the effectiveness of protection measures;\n\nc. Implement centralized logging and alerting capabilities;\n\nd. Develop adequate security vulnerability management standards, policies, procedures, and practices such as:\n\ni. testing, auditing, assessing, or reviewing its products, or applications; security features; and\n\nii. conducting regular risk assessments, vulnerability scans, and penetration testing of its networks and databases;\n\ne. Implement secure network controls, such as disabling unnecessary ports, protocols, and services, and properly configuring firewall settings;\n\nf. Adequately encrypt customer’s data in transit or at rest; and\n\ng. Develop adequate written information security standards, policies, procedures, and practices; assess or enforce compliance with the written standards, policies, procedures, and practices that it did have; and implement training for employees (including engineers) regarding such standards, policies, procedures and practices.\n\nParagraph 3 of the complaint states that these “failures allowed a threat actor to access Defendant’s customer support accounts, view customer cameras, and access personal information relating to customers and consumers.”\n\nThe complaint included two counts of unfair information security practices in violation of § 5 of the FTC Act (one count for consumers and one for business customers); and five counts of deception in violation of § 5 (two counts of information security misrepresentations; one for HIPAA compliance misrepresentations; one for Privacy Shield misrepresentations; and two counts related to failure to disclose some online reviews were from individuals with “material connections” to Verkada and thus were not “impartial”). The complaint also included 3 counts relating to CAN-SPAM (failure to honor opt-outs; failure to provide notice of opt-out opportunity; and failure to provide physical postal address). CAN-SPAM includes civil penalties, and these formed the basis of the $2.95 million proposed settlement.\n\nThe proposed order contains many provisions similar to previous FTC settlements, but there are a few items that are particularly noteworthy:\n\n“Customer Information” [note this is not “consumer” information] includes not only user account credentials and email addresses, but also site floorplans, names and titles of customer contacts, Wi-Fi credentials; metadata about product usage and “access control elements, including access levels, access groups, and badge numbers.”\n\n“Personal information” includes not only names, addresses, and birthdates, but also live camera footage, video archives, still images or photos, and audio recordings.\n\nThe proposed order would last for 20 years and prohibits misrepresentations and violations of CAN-SPAM, and it would require that company implement an information security program (including someone responsible for overseeing it as well as multi-factor authentication), and third-party assessments. The proposed order contains an interesting prohibition on the third party assessor: “No finding of any Assessment shall rely primarily on assertions or attestations by Defendant’s management.”\n\nOur Take\n\nThere seems to be a trend developing among regulators, outlining the elements of “reasonable security.” This proposed judgment marks the third within two months that focuses on what is (or is not) “reasonable security.” The first settlement involved the New York Attorney General’s interpretation of New York’s SHIELD Act (see our write-up here); the second consent involved the California Attorney General’s requirements (involving Blackbaud, here); and this one is from the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nYet these three regulators, acting under very different laws, found that “reasonable security” includes all of the following elements, which certainly are not sufficient to demonstrate “reasonable security,” but all of which these regulators found to be necessary:\n\nDesignation of an individual in charge of the information security program\n\nEncryption of personal data,\n\nIntrusion detection and prevention;\n\nMulti-factor authentication,\n\nPassword management, and\n\nSegmentation/limiting access.\n\nAnd each proposed settlement included a multi-million-dollar payment.\n\nImportantly, here the FTC did not just focus on personal information of consumers, but confidential business information of Verkada’s customers. This expansion is a significant addition as breach notification laws focus entirely on personal information and, absent contract or affirmative representations, a victim of a security incident is not obligated to notify another business of the loss of their business information.",

The new valuation is a billion-dollar jump over its previous $3.5 billion value, and the financing brings the company’s total funding raised to more than $650 million to date, according to PitchBook data.\n\nVerkada did not comment on the deal. A spokesperson for General Catalyst didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nFounded in 2016, Verkada sells internet-connected security products, including cameras equipped with facial recognition software, alarm systems and intercoms, to corporations, police departments, school districts and more, according to its website.\n\nThe shooting of UnitedHealth Group Inc. executive Brian Thompson earlier this month has driven more interest in physical safety precautions, including services like those sold by Verkada, as corporations look to enhance security measures.\n\n“Had it not been for cameras, I am not sure they would have been able to solve this,” said Verkada investor Aydin Senkut, founder of Felicis Ventures, referring to the search for Thompson’s killer. “The reality is that the only way we are going to be safer in society is if we have more cameras.”\n\nThe new funding round comes shortly after the Federal Trade Commission in August issued Verkada a $2.95 million fine for failing to implement appropriate information security practices, which allowed a hacker to access cameras inside psychiatric hospitals and women’s health clinics, the agency said in a statement.\n\nDuring the March 2021 hack, attackers gained access to 150,000 live cameras, allowing them to see inside Tesla Inc. and cybersecurity company Cloudflare Inc., and to view police interviews, Bloomberg reported.\n\nVerkada’s existing investors include First Round Capital, Next47, Sequoia Capital and Meritech Capital.\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "# [Privacy Perils Series: Verkada Case on 2024-09-19](https://www.schwabe.com/publication/privacy-perils-what-went-wrong/)\nThe FTC’s recent enforcement action against a B2B company is a cautionary tale about ‎common, easy-to-avoid privacy, security, and marketing missteps; and a reminder that fines ‎aren’t the only consequences to fear in an enforcement action.‎\n\nIn addition to paying a $3M fine, for the next 20 years the FTC will require Verkada, Inc. to implement a comprehensive information security program, submit to third-party information security assessments, and comply with other robust administrative requirements to settle allegations that the company’s privacy, security, and marketing practices violated the law. To implement these obligations will require significant resources and investments. In the complaint filed by the Department of Justice at the FTC’s request, Verkada is alleged to have engaged in many unfair or deceptive business practices. Here are the top five, many of which are all too common:\n\nFailing to Adequately Protect Data. The complaint alleges that Verkada failed to provide reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect the personal information it collected and maintained, and that allowed a hacker to gain access to information from more than 150,000 live security cameras—including some in sensitive locations, such as psychiatric hospitals, women’s health clinics, children’s bedrooms, and prison cells. According to the complaint, reasonable and appropriate measures should have included:\n\nAccess management basics, such as the use of unique and complex passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication\n\nLogin monitoring to flag suspicious activities, such as unsuccessful logins to administrative accounts, and the addition or removal of any account with administrative privileges\n\nRegular risk assessments, vulnerability scans, and penetration testing\n\nTesting, auditing, and review of the effectiveness of security measures and services\n\nUse of encryption at rest and in transit, as well as network controls, such as properly configured firewalls\n\nDevelopment of adequate written information security standards, policies, procedures, and practices; and adequate training of employees on same\n\nMaking Misleading Statements about Data Protection Investments and Commitment. Verkada is alleged to have misrepresented its security practices in numerous ways. ‎First, their privacy policy claimed: “[W]e take customer privacy seriously” and “use best-in-class data security tools and best practices to keep your data safe.” Second, the company’s website purportedly contained misleading statements such as, “[f]rom Day 1, we’ve made technology decisions that strengthen security and … Verkada uses commercially reasonable efforts to deploy and uphold [] security best practices and standards….” Finally, in blog posts, press releases, and interviews, Verkada assured customers of the quality of its security practices and commitment to data protection. The complaint specifically references the following quote from Verkada’s CEO: “We built a system that’s end-to-end secure. That’s a huge problem with today’s systems. Verkada is secure out of the box.”\n\nMisrepresenting Privacy and Security Compliance. When Verkada marketed, promoted, advertised, and sold its products and services, the FTC claims the company frequently misrepresented it was (1) HIPAA-certified or compliant and (2) that it adhered to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield principles.\n\nSending Incessant Marketing Emails That Lacked Compliance Elements and Ignoring Customer Complaints. Verkada is alleged to have sent over 30 million promotional emails without an effective unsubscribe mechanism, and without including a valid, physical postal address in the body of the message. Email recipients repeatedly notified Verkada they didn’t want the emails, and they were unable to unsubscribe, despite multiple attempts.\n\nPosting Fake Reviews. Verkada employees and an investor purportedly violated FTC rules by posting positive online ratings and reviews without disclosing their relationship to the company or employee status, an activity which was at times encouraged. The complaint alleged that in June 2023, 35% of Google Maps ratings and reviews for Verkada were attributable to this practice, which FTC deems unlawful business.\n\nWhat are some better practices?\n\nImplement adequate security measures that take into account the types of information you process. Such measures should include technical, physical, and organizational controls designed to prevent unauthorized access to, use of, loss of, or alterations to information you process about consumers and businesses.\n\nTake stock of your data. Take inventory of the categories of personal information your company collects to ensure the information is processed lawfully. That may include analyzing many issues, such as whether personal information is being used for the purpose it was collected? Is it secured adequately, and what is the potential harm if it were disclosed improperly? How do data retention and deletion processes align with requirements and business needs?\n\nKnow Your Requirements. Ensure you understand your privacy and security obligations by identifying the laws and regulations that apply to your business, and revisit your assessments regularly, because data protection laws are proliferating.\n\nEnact policies and procedures that support your compliance needs. These could include conducting routine risk assessments and security testing, holding regular training for employees, and adopting written data practices and standards. It is common practice now to have a team and policy in place to respond to data privacy requests.\n\nBe aware of marketing pitfalls. CAN-SPAM was not on our 2024 Privacy Enforcement Bingo Card! While CAN-SPAM regulate many aspects of marketing, this enforcement action also serves as a great reminder of the many local, state, federal, and international laws that govern promotional communications (including texts and phone calls), digital advertising campaigns, and other common activities aimed to create brand awareness, generate leads, and increase demand.\n\nCommunicate Marketing Guardrails. If innovative marketing campaigns are key to your success, consider developing a marketing playbook or policy. This internal document is intended to clearly describe a company’s compliance obligations, outline prohibited activities, and establish processes and procedures to ensure the company is responsive to new rules, complaints, opt-out requests, customer concerns, and more. To provide a place to start, the FTC recently issued a final rule that addresses reviews and testimonials, and the FTC endorsement guides outline disclosure requirements in advertising.\n\nHave a Top-Notch Privacy Statement. Transparency can be an excellent risk mitigation strategy. Plus, companies often find that updating their privacy statement can expose significant risks. Those benefits are lost if the privacy statement contains privacy platitudes similar to those highlighted in the Verkada complaint. Many companies make a point to update their privacy statement at least annually to ensure that they are up to date.\n\nThe case is available here.\n\nThis article summarizes aspects of the law and does not constitute legal advice.
