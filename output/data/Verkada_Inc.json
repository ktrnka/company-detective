      "# [Physical Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDS)](https://info.verkada.com/perimeter-security/)\n1. Deter\n\nThe objective of perimeter security is to deter malicious actors from attempting the intrusion in the first place. With video surveillance technology integrated with perimeter alarms and access control, organizations have real-time visibility into unusual or suspicious activity, with can be verified remotely by professional monitoring or a virtual guard.\n\n2. Detect\n\nWith detection, perimeter security’s objective is to monitor and catch unauthorized intrusions in real-time. Video surveillance technology, especially high-resolution security cameras, can be leveraged to accurately identify breaches and notify security personnel – especially with the ability to digitally or optically zoom in to the area where intrusion was detected.\n\n4. Deny\n\nThe “deny” perimeter keeps unauthorized persons out, while allowing authorized persons to enter. To perform this function, the deny perimeter typically has access control technology or a monitored security gate at the point of entry. The intention of surveillance at this point is to provide video verification to door entry system.\n\n5. Delay\n\nThe “delay” perimeter’s purpose is to offset an active intrusion. Video security cameras can be used inside the “delay” perimeter to provide situational awareness and postpone the intrusion long enough for authorities to respond.\n\n6. Defend\n\nThe “defend” perimeter is typically the physical security or professional monitor response to intrusion alerts. Surveillance is leveraged to decide the efficacy of the security response. This final line of defense often includes police or law enforcement."

Pair that with multiple data breaches and a reputation for cutting out their own dealers to steal their customers…  they aren’t a good partner to the industry.\n\n## Comment ID lm5dxf8 with +1 score by [(Interesting-File-666, Reddit, 2024-09-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/accesscontrol/comments/1fayo1d/verkada/lm5dxf8/) (in reply to ID 1fayo1d):\nVerkada is expensive. But if you want to go with them my suggestion is starting from scratch and not doing a system transfer or upgrade. That means pay for the labor to pull all new wire to devices and demo the existing one. Doing this can actually save money in the long run. \nVerkada is easy to install and easy to program and use but only if the installer is the one doing the work from start to finish.\nTheir products are trash and half the time need to be returned and replaced once right out of the box so when a general bid is at 2 weeks it will probably be more like 3 because of all the random stuff going on.\nVerkada support is great because they are always available when you need them. But there is a disconnect between IT and the Installer/electrical side when trying to explain the issues that can arise. \nMake sure the network is also dedicated as there are many times when Verkada systems no longer connect with the network because it turns some systems (not all of them) need a dedicated network and some don’t. \nThere are pros and cons to every system. I’m personally not a fan of Verkada equipment and systems because they are cheap for the price being paid, and Axis can do all the same cloud based stuff with added controllers. So depends on what you want to do.\n\n## Comment ID lm9d4p7 with +1 score by [(Ok_Energy2010, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/accesscontrol/comments/1fayo1d/verkada/lm9d4p7/) (in reply to ID 1fayo1d):\nGo cloud based with Brivo & Eagle Eye Networks.  Easy to implement, use Google and Apple wallet to store credentials and have Access and Video all in one platform.\n\n## Comment ID lm9vhbk with +1 score by [(Wolverine_SmushyFace, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/accesscontrol/comments/1fayo1d/verkada/lm9vhbk/) (in reply to ID 1fayo1d):\nAt the end of the day, it’s whatever the customer wants most, budget pending. You can inform and educate on every pitfall of each ACS and still end up with the customer choosing the polar opposite. Lots of great choices out there, some definitely better than others, but customers are a wily bunch.\n\n## Comment ID lmb39g4 with +1 score by [(TheMAN0215, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/accesscontrol/comments/1fayo1d/verkada/lmb39g4/) (in reply to ID 1fayo1d):\nHanwha Wave Server and PDK access control may be a good option for you. They integrate."

One of the best hardware engineers I worked with was fired a few months ago due to the toxic culture in the camera hardware team. It was a great shame for his managers to do this since he had helped solve almost all the critical issues for the product before its launch, and then he was suddenly let go. Some higher level people spoiled the EPMs for no reason, and one or two of these EPMs who was or is still on the team is the root cause of such toxic vibes. This includes, but is not limited to, talking behind someone's back and creating dramas.

          "cons": "If you are seeking a role that allows you to fully utilize your sales skills, this position may not align with your goals. The role primarily involves facilitating camera demonstrations rather than direct sales. The real selling is performed by partners, who manage site visits, in-person meetings, and other key activities. If assigned a less favorable territory, you may find it challenging to achieve your targets. Partners exert significant control over deals, and your role often involves merely checking in on deal status and providing updated quotes. Yes you are traveling to these territories as well its all paid for by the company, but most of the visits you are either kissing partners butts with lunch and dinners or begging customers for purchase orders. Thats what you 6 hour plane ride consists of, very degrading.\n\nWhile you can arrange meetings between partners and customers, your role is largely intermediary. Success in this position can be heavily influenced by territory and luck, as previous reps may have already exhausted key contacts. Meeting sales quotas often relies on renewals or deals brought in by partners rather than your own efforts. It’s also challenging to prospect new business due to prior outreach by other representatives. They don't explain this to you during interviews (but why would they, you probably wouldn't take the position) so the turnover rate is very high. People will not return to work. One day you'll see Fred or Sarah and then days and weeks will go by and you will never see them again. You will have to learn from other employees that Fred or Sarah was either fired for \"unknown\" reasons or they quit.\n\nIn some cases, individuals may achieve their quotas with minimal effort if they receive high-value deals from partners. Recognition is often given to those who benefit from such opportunities, even if their contribution to securing the deal was limited. The emphasis in this role is more on managing communications and relationships with partners rather than driving direct sales outcomes.\n\nIf you are on the cooperate side of the company, your quota first qtr can be as high as 100k-125k. Sled side is given a smaller quota, seeing as their deals take longer to come in, around 40k-60k. If you are looking to be promoted within these fields, they expect you to hit multiple times in a row on your quota, extremely unrealistic expectations.",

The role primarily involves facilitating camera demonstrations rather than direct sales. The real selling is performed by partners, who manage site visits, in-person meetings, and other key activities. If assigned a less favorable territory, you may find it challenging to achieve your targets. Partners exert significant control over deals, and your role often involves merely checking in on deal status and providing updated quotes. Yes you are traveling to these territories as well its all paid for by the company, but most of the visits you are either kissing partners butts with lunch and dinners or begging customers for purchase orders. Thats what you 6 hour plane ride consists of, very degrading.\n\nWhile you can arrange meetings between partners and customers, your role is largely intermediary. Success in this position can be heavily influenced by territory and luck, as previous reps may have already exhausted key contacts. Meeting sales quotas often relies on renewals or deals brought in by partners rather than your own efforts. It’s also challenging to prospect new business due to prior outreach by other representatives. They don't explain this to you during interviews (but why would they, you probably wouldn't take the position) so the turnover rate is very high. People will not return to work. One day you'll see Fred or Sarah and then days and weeks will go by and you will never see them again. You will have to learn from other employees that Fred or Sarah was either fired for \"unknown\" reasons or they quit.\n\nIn some cases, individuals may achieve their quotas with minimal effort if they receive high-value deals from partners. Recognition is often given to those who benefit from such opportunities, even if their contribution to securing the deal was limited. The emphasis in this role is more on managing communications and relationships with partners rather than driving direct sales outcomes.\n\nIf you are on the cooperate side of the company, your quota first qtr can be as high as 100k-125k. Sled side is given a smaller quota, seeing as their deals take longer to come in, around 40k-60k.

      "# [FTC Takes Action Against Security Camera Firm Verkada over Charges it Failed to Secure Videos, Other Personal Data and Violated CAN-SPAM Act on 2024-08-30](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/08/ftc-takes-action-against-security-camera-firm-verkada-over-charges-it-failed-secure-videos-other)\nThe Federal Trade Commission will require security camera firm Verkada to develop and implement a comprehensive information security program to settle allegations the company failed to use appropriate information security practices, which allowed a hacker to access customers’ security cameras.\n\nUnder a proposed order, which must be approved by a federal judge before it can go into effect, Verkada will also be required to pay a $2.95 million monetary penalty to settle allegations the company inundated prospective customers with commercial emails in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act, the largest penalty obtained by the FTC for a CAN-SPAM violation.\n\nA complaint filed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) upon notification and referral from the FTC, alleged that Verkada failed to use appropriate information security practices to protect consumers’ personal information, which allowed a hacker to access internet-connected security cameras and view patients in psychiatric hospitals and women’s health clinics. The complaint also charged that Verkada was aware that employees and a venture capital investor posted positive ratings and reviews of Verkada and its products but failed to disclose their association or current employment status with Verkada.\n\nThe complaint also alleged that Verkada violated the CAN-SPAM Act (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing) by flooding prospective customers with a barrage of commercial emails and failing to include the option to unsubscribe or opt-out, honor opt-out requests, and provide a physical postal address in the emails.\n\n“When customers invite companies into private spaces to monitor consumers by using their security cameras and other products, they expect those companies to provide basic levels of security, which Verkada failed to do,” said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “Companies that fail to secure and protect consumer data can expect to be held responsible.”\n\n“This settlement underscores the importance of robust data security measures, especially for companies that are themselves in the security industry. Failure to protect sensitive information puts consumers at risk,” said Brian M. Boynton, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “We will continue to work with the FTC to hold companies accountable for such violations.”\n\nCalifornia-based Verkada sells IP-enabled security cameras and other physical security offerings to thousands of customers, both in the United States and overseas, including those that operate from sensitive locations like schools and hospitals. In its privacy policy, press releases, blog posts and other materials, Verkada claimed it takes data security and customer privacy seriously. For example, in its privacy policy in 2018, the company claimed it uses “best-in-class data security tools and best practices to keep your data safe and protect the Verkada Products from unauthorized access.”\n\nThe complaint alleges that despite such claims, Verkada failed to provide appropriate security measures to protect the personal information it collects, which includes sensitive video footage from its security cameras as well as data about customer accounts such as names, email addresses, passwords and site floorplans. For example, the company failed to require unique and complex passwords, adequately encrypt customer data, and implement secure network controls.\n\nAs a result of these security failures, the complaint alleges, the company experienced at least two security breaches between December 2020 and March 2021. In the March 2021 breach, the hacker had access to over 150,000 live Verkada customer cameras as well as other customer information, such as physical addresses, audio recordings, and customer WiFi credentials.\n\nAdditionally, Verkada misled consumers with respect to its compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. According to the complaint, Verkada’s security practices were not compliant with either HIPAA or either Privacy Shield framework.\n\nThe complaint further alleges that Verkada also misled consumers by failing to disclose that certain online consumer ratings and reviews of its camera products were written by Verkada employees and a venture capital investor, according to the complaint. For example, a venture capitalist who invested in Verkada posted a five-star rating and positive review on Google Maps.\n\nLastly, the complaint alleges that Verkada violated the CAN-SPAM Act in several ways. According to the complaint, Verkada relied on commercial email campaigns to help market its products, sending more than 30 million commercial emails over a three-year period. Verkada’s commercial emails violated the CAN-SPAM Act in four ways, including not honoring email recipients’ requests to unsubscribe.\n\nIn addition to the monetary penalty, the proposed order also will prohibit the company from making misrepresentations about Verkada’s privacy and data security practices and require it to implement a comprehensive information security program with third-party audits. The proposed order also will prohibit Verkada from violating the CAN-SPAM Act.\n\nThe Commission voted 5-0 to refer the complaint and stipulated order to DOJ. The DOJ filed the complaint and stipulated order in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District California. Commissioner Melissa Holyoak issued a separate concurring statement.\n\nNOTE: The Commission authorizes the filing of a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the named defendant is violating or is about to violate the law and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. Stipulated orders have the force of law when approved and signed by the District Court judge.\n\nThe lead staff attorneys on this matter are Jacqueline Ford and Kamay Lafalaise from the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection.",

      "# [$2.95M Penalty and Permanent Injunction Resolves Lawsuit Against Verkada Inc. for Alleged Unlawful Commercial Emails, Data Security Failures and Deceptive Practices on 2024-09-04](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/295m-penalty-and-permanent-injunction-resolves-lawsuit-against-verkada-inc-alleged-unlawful)\nThe Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced today that Verkada Inc. (Verkada), a cloud-based security company headquartered in San Mateo, California, has agreed to a settlement requiring it to pay a $2.95 million civil penalty and implement extensive data security measures. This settlement resolves allegations that Verkada violated the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Act and engaged in unfair and deceptive practices in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act.\n\nIn a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the United States alleges that Verkada failed to implement reasonable security measures such as appropriate access management and data protection controls and adequate encryption of customer data. These failures allegedly exposed sensitive information — including security-camera footage of consumers visiting locations like hospitals and schools — to unauthorized access. The complaint additionally alleges that Verkada misrepresented the extent to which it used appropriate data security safeguards and complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). The complaint also alleges that Verkada sent numerous promotional emails that failed to clearly and conspicuously notify recipients of their opportunity to opt out of such messages and failed to include a valid physical postal address, and that Verkada did not honor requests to opt out from its promotional emails within ten business days of receiving those requests, all in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act.\n\nTo resolve the lawsuit, the parties agreed to a settlement reflected by the stipulated order issued today by the Court. The stipulated order requires Verkada to pay a $2.95 million civil penalty and to comply with the CAN-SPAM Act, including by honoring requests to opt out of its commercial emails. The stipulated order also prohibits Verkada from misrepresenting its data security practices and requires it to establish a comprehensive information security program and undergo regular third-party assessments of its data security practices.\n\n“This settlement underscores the importance of robust data security measures, especially for companies that are themselves in the security industry. Failure to protect sensitive information puts consumers at risk,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “We will continue to work with the FTC to hold companies accountable for such violations.”\n\n“When customers invite companies into private spaces to monitor consumers by using their security cameras and other products, they expect those companies to provide basic levels of security, which Verkada failed to do,” said Director Samuel Levin of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “Companies that fail to secure and protect consumer data can expect to be held responsible.”\n\nTrial Attorneys Cameron A. Brown and Amanda K. Kelly, Senior Trial Attorney James T. Nelson and Assistant Director Zachary A. Dietert of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Vivian Wang for the Northern District of California are handling the case, in coordination with staff from the FTC’s Division of Privacy and Identity Protection.",

      "# [Security cameras, CAN-SPAM, and “reasonable or appropriate security” by David Kessler (US), Susan Ross (US) on 2024-09-09](https://www.dataprotectionreport.com/2024/09/security-cameras-can-spam-and-reasonable-or-appropriate-security/)\nOn August 30, 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a proposed settlement with security camera manufacturer Verkada Inc., claiming Verkada committed a variety of unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and CAN-SPAM in connection with a security breach. (The U.S. Department of Justice filed that complaint and proposed stipulated joint order on behalf of the FTC.) Verkada does not admit or deny the claims (Order, para. 4).\n\nBackground\n\nAccording to the complaint, Verkada developed and sold security cameras and other surveillance products to businesses, including schools and medical facilities. Between 2019 and 2021, Verkada sold over 240,000 cameras, which were linked to Verkada’s platform, which enabled customers to have remote access to the cameras and stored surveillance footage. Verkada collected metadata about the security camera usage (including IP addresses and locations) as well as customer names, addresses, usernames and passwords, site floorplans, names of organizational contacts and Wi-Fi credentials.\n\nThe video cameras collected images of individuals, including patients and schoolchildren, as well as sensitive personal information (including medical records). The complaint states that Verkada offered its customers “People Analytics,” which allowed customers to search through video images collected for gender, clothing color, and/or to use facial recognition.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Verkada’s website made several claims about its security practices, including claims that it was HIPAA certified and compliant with the EU-US Privacy Shield. The complaint alleges the Verkada sent out large numbers of commercial emails, but did not include functional opt-out features, and also did not honor opt-outs it did receive. The complaint also claims that Verkada also did not include a clear and conspicuous opportunity to opt-out in emails and did not consistently include a physical postal address.\n\nParagraph 20 of the complaint asserts that Verkada did not take reasonable measures to secure the customer and consumer data, listing “Defendant’s information security failures” as follows:\n\na. Impose reasonable access management controls such as:\n\ni. requiring unique and complex passwords (i.e., long passwords not used by the individual for any other online service);\n\nii. enforcing role-based access controls to safeguard personal information, such as implementing the principle of least privilege and requiring multi-factor authentication for account access across all of Defendant’s systems;\n\niii. issuing alerts for activities, such as unsuccessful logins to administrative accounts and the addition or removal of any account with administrative privileges;\n\nb. Prevent data loss by establishing data protection controls, such as:\n\ni. performing data discovery and categorization for all sensitive personal information to ensure it is appropriately protected during transmission and storage;\n\nii. implementing a data loss prevention solution that monitors for suspicious activities such as unauthorized data access and exfiltration; and\n\niii. performing regular assessments to determine the effectiveness of protection measures;\n\nc. Implement centralized logging and alerting capabilities;\n\nd. Develop adequate security vulnerability management standards, policies, procedures, and practices such as:\n\ni. testing, auditing, assessing, or reviewing its products, or applications; security features; and\n\nii. conducting regular risk assessments, vulnerability scans, and penetration testing of its networks and databases;\n\ne. Implement secure network controls, such as disabling unnecessary ports, protocols, and services, and properly configuring firewall settings;\n\nf. Adequately encrypt customer’s data in transit or at rest; and\n\ng. Develop adequate written information security standards, policies, procedures, and practices; assess or enforce compliance with the written standards, policies, procedures, and practices that it did have; and implement training for employees (including engineers) regarding such standards, policies, procedures and practices.\n\nParagraph 3 of the complaint states that these “failures allowed a threat actor to access Defendant’s customer support accounts, view customer cameras, and access personal information relating to customers and consumers.”\n\nThe complaint included two counts of unfair information security practices in violation of § 5 of the FTC Act (one count for consumers and one for business customers); and five counts of deception in violation of § 5 (two counts of information security misrepresentations; one for HIPAA compliance misrepresentations; one for Privacy Shield misrepresentations; and two counts related to failure to disclose some online reviews were from individuals with “material connections” to Verkada and thus were not “impartial”). The complaint also included 3 counts relating to CAN-SPAM (failure to honor opt-outs; failure to provide notice of opt-out opportunity; and failure to provide physical postal address). CAN-SPAM includes civil penalties, and these formed the basis of the $2.95 million proposed settlement.\n\nThe proposed order contains many provisions similar to previous FTC settlements, but there are a few items that are particularly noteworthy:\n\n“Customer Information” [note this is not “consumer” information] includes not only user account credentials and email addresses, but also site floorplans, names and titles of customer contacts, Wi-Fi credentials; metadata about product usage and “access control elements, including access levels, access groups, and badge numbers.”\n\n“Personal information” includes not only names, addresses, and birthdates, but also live camera footage, video archives, still images or photos, and audio recordings.\n\nThe proposed order would last for 20 years and prohibits misrepresentations and violations of CAN-SPAM, and it would require that company implement an information security program (including someone responsible for overseeing it as well as multi-factor authentication), and third-party assessments. The proposed order contains an interesting prohibition on the third party assessor: “No finding of any Assessment shall rely primarily on assertions or attestations by Defendant’s management.”\n\nOur Take\n\nThere seems to be a trend developing among regulators, outlining the elements of “reasonable security.” This proposed judgment marks the third within two months that focuses on what is (or is not) “reasonable security.” The first settlement involved the New York Attorney General’s interpretation of New York’s SHIELD Act (see our write-up here); the second consent involved the California Attorney General’s requirements (involving Blackbaud, here); and this one is from the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nYet these three regulators, acting under very different laws, found that “reasonable security” includes all of the following elements, which certainly are not sufficient to demonstrate “reasonable security,” but all of which these regulators found to be necessary:\n\nDesignation of an individual in charge of the information security program\n\nEncryption of personal data,\n\nIntrusion detection and prevention;\n\nMulti-factor authentication,\n\nPassword management, and\n\nSegmentation/limiting access.\n\nAnd each proposed settlement included a multi-million-dollar payment.\n\nImportantly, here the FTC did not just focus on personal information of consumers, but confidential business information of Verkada’s customers. This expansion is a significant addition as breach notification laws focus entirely on personal information and, absent contract or affirmative representations, a victim of a security incident is not obligated to notify another business of the loss of their business information.",

      "# [Sonoma Valley school board decides hours after lockdown to invest $442,000 in security cameras by DANIEL JOHNSON on 2023-11-11](https://www.sonomanews.com/article/news/sonoma-valley-school-board-decides-hours-after-lockdown-to-invest-442000/)\nHours after Thursday’s lockdown of four Sonoma Valley schools, the Sonoma Valley Unified School District Board of Trustees unanimously voted to spend over $440,000 to install cloud-based security cameras on all campuses.\n\nAfter an impassioned plea from Oz Robledo, the district’s information technology manager, the board approved the $442,282.57 purchase at its meeting Thursday. It has been listed as an agenda item for the meeting days before someone sent an email to a Sonoma Valley High School staff member at 9:49 a.m. Thursday, threatening to use a firearm to kill people on campus.\n\nThe threat prompted a five-hour lockdown of the high school campus, as well as adjacent Adele Harrison Middle School and nearby Prestwood Elementary School.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol officers and California State Parks police officers responded to the schools, along with the Sonoma Police Department. The Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office provided patrol deputies, aerial surveillance, SWAT team deputies, a K-9 apprehension dog and a bomb detection K-9.\n\nThe Sonoma Valley Police Department and the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office Violent Crimes Investigation Unit continue to investigate who sent the email with the threat.\n\nSonoma Police Chief Brandon Cutting said the threat seemed credible because it contained a location, method of violence and crime, and that it remains “a very significant case.”\n\n“There are several felony charges that can be applied to this situation,” he said.\n\nVerkada Inc. successfully bid on the project to install the cameras, which the district will fund through a five-year capital lease financing agreement.\n\n“I am convinced that we, as a board, need to ensure that our staff are equipped with the appropriate resources to perform their roles effectively, prioritizing safety across all campuses, and I believe the rest of the board concurs,” Trustee John Kelly said.\n\nThe cameras will be installed and operational by January 2024, Kelly added.\n\n“Further, considering that this equipment’s installation will enable us to avoid erecting additional fences, gates, walls and access controls on all our campuses, it’s clear we’re opting for a more effective solution that aligns with our staff’s advice.”\n\nTrustee Troy Knox said the cameras will enable law enforcement and the district’s IT department to respond swiftly when investigating incidents on campuses and with much greater levels of accuracy.\n\n“Our current surveillance system is quite limited with regard to visibility, coverage and video quality,” Knox said. “The time it takes to share footage with law enforcement is significantly slower compared to the newer technology.”\n\nCutting said the new cameras will be helpful in dealing with situations like what unfolded Thursday.\n\n“Had we found a weapon, or identified a student or person who made the threat at the time of the search, we would have been able to track the steps of the person to know if there is an immediate threat to the campus or if we need to focus our law enforcement efforts off campus to locate a suspect,” he said.\n\n“Had there been a decent perimeter camera system, we could have placed a deputy with the camera viewing area to identify if anyone tried to get onto or off the campus while we were in the shelter-in-place and search of the school grounds.”\n\nCutting said similar situations are happening throughout the country and have led to the need for structural changes that make campuses feel more secure.\n\nSonoma Valley Unified School District began exploring installation of more advanced security cameras partly due to violent incidents on the annual, unsponsored Fugitive Nights at Sonoma Valley High School.\n\n“The cameras are a great way to keep the (Sonoma Valley high schools’) campus open,” Cutting said. “An intruder to a campus can climb a fence, but cannot escape the camera.”\n\nNearly all schools in Sonoma Valley Unified School District have an “open campus” by design, he said.\n\n“The community has remained strong in the desire to keep the campuses with an open feel,” Cutting said.\n\nThough, he said, “a camera does not protect the campus from threats, nor does a fence.”\n\n“It does allow the schools to collect evidence for things like simple vandalism, trespassing, theft or worse, such as violence on campus,” he said.\n\nLaw enforcement personnel and school district staff were praised for their efficiency in locking down the four campuses and assuring their safety Thursday.\n\nSome students, however, criticized the district’s response following the lockdown, in which they said they were forced to use buckets for toilets and were served moldy food, or none at all.\n\nStudents were lauded for their cooperation throughout the ordeal, though one student was cited for disruptive behavior.\n\nCutting said that, as a parent, he looks at every incident at the schools as if his kids were there.\n\n“On Nov. 9, I felt very comforted by the actions of the schools and all of the law enforcement representation that was present on or about the campus to the point that I would know that my child was completely safe for the evolution.”\n\nHe said it isn’t clear how someone will react in an emergency until it happens.\n\nHe acknowledged that improvements can always be made, though.\n\n“We can all, always do better!” he said.\n\n“We have not identified anything that was done ‘wrong,’ but are working through our discussion on what could have been done better by use so we can train and implement these things next time.”\n\nOne problem that students have reported concerned the food that was to be provided to students during the five-hour lockdown. A student at Sonoma Valley High School said that it was “inedible, moldy and had expired” and some other students said their class didn’t receive any food.\n\n“I heard there were some issues with the food that is kept in classrooms for these types of emergencies, and I suspect the school site will address that,” Cutting said. “The school staff was constantly looking for ways to get food from the kitchen to the kids.”\n\nHe said that law enforcement personnel had to search each room in the high schools before food could be delivered, thereby slowing down the process. High school staff members partnered with a deputy and followed the search team to deliver food to each classroom.\n\n“Due to the complexities of the search, food delivery was after the normal lunch hour and we apologize for that, but there were many factors that we had to account for that took priority at that time,” Cutting said.\n\nTrustee Celeste Winders added, “In the days and weeks to come, as a district we will, of course, review steps taken, their effectiveness, what things we need more of, things we need to do differently and steps we can take to improve best practices.\n\n“Each year, the safety plans are reviewed, edited, revised and then approved by the board to make the plans and protocols better and meet the needs in a world that is ever-changing and evolving.”\n\nReach the reporter, Dan Johnson, at daniel.johnson@sonomanews.com.",
      "# [FTC Penalizes Cloud-Based Physical Security Company for Data Security and CAN-SPAM Violations by Kirk J. Nahra, Ali A. Jessani, Sarah Litwin on 2024-09-30](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/blogs/wilmerhale-privacy-and-cybersecurity-law/20240930-ftc-penalizes-cloudbased-physical-security-company-for-data-security-and-canspam-violations)\nOn August 30, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) entered into a proposed settlement order with cloud-based physical security solutions provider, Verkada Inc. (“Verkada”), settling allegations of data security violations and mandating a record monetary payment (of $2.95 million) to remedy separate allegations of unlawful email marketing practices in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act. The agency’s case against Verkada stemmed from the business’s alleged failure to use appropriate information security practices, which the agency claimed allowed a hacker to access customers’ security cameras and sensitive personal information about consumers, as a result. This action also alleged that Verkada misrepresented its security practices, as well as its compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) rules and with Privacy Shield.\n\nThis settlement is notable for a few reasons. First, it shows that – while the FTC is focused on creating new substantive security and privacy obligations for entities through its ability to enforce “unfair” violations under Section 5 of the FTC Act – it is still looking to enforce the older privacy laws that fall within its jurisdiction (such as CAN-SPAM). The FTC is also actively looking to bring enforcement actions against companies where an alleged privacy or security violation leads to the potential compromise of sensitive data. Finally, the agency still cares about the representations company’s make about their security compliance, especially if those representations relate to compliance with a formal security program (such as the security requirements mandated by HIPAA). It is also notable for companies that the FTC is continuing to enforce historic compliance efforts with Privacy Shield, even though the program has been replaced by the Data Privacy Framework.\n\nIn this article, we summarize the agency’s complaint and order against Verkada and identify key takeaways from the decision. To stay up to date on the latest state privacy law developments, please subscribe to the WilmerHale Privacy and Cybersecurity Law Blog.\n\nI.Summary of the Complaint\n\nVerkada is a developer of physical security solutions that include video security cameras, door locks, and panic buttons, among other products, as well as a cloud-based software platform to manage them. The company sells these solutions to over 26,000 organizations today, including office buildings, warehouses, retail stores, healthcare facilities, and schools. Some of Verkada’s customers deploy the products in sensitive areas that implicate privacy concerns (such as schools and psychiatric hospitals).\n\nIn its complaint, the FTC alleged Verkada engaged in (i) multiple data security practices and failures that resulted in repeated risk of consumer data exposure and led to cybersecurity intrusions. The agency also charged Verkada with engaging in other deceptive and unfair practices including (ii) misrepresenting its security practices to consumers, (iii) misrepresenting alleged HIPAA certification and Privacy Shield compliance, (iv) failing to disclose the association or employment relationship of certain individuals who posted positive ratings and reviews about Verkada and its products online, and (v) failing to include provide consumers with an option to unsubscribe or opt-out, honor opt-out requests, and provide a physical postal address in emails.\n\nThe FTC explained the following was considered to be an unfair or deceptive practices in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act:\n\nFailure to Safeguard Personal Information\n\nThe FTC asserted that Verkada failed to safeguard customers’ and consumers’ personal information collected through the company’s security cameras. Specifically, the agency claimed that Verkada failed to impose reasonable access management controls including strong password authentication, role-based access controls, and issue alerts for activities such as incorrect logins to administrative accounts or removal of privileges for accounts. In addition, according to the complaint, the company failed to establish data loss protection or perform data discovery and categorization for all sensitive personal information or regular assessments to determine the effectiveness of protection measures. Verkada also allegedly had no centralized logging and alerting capabilities, nor did it conduct regular risk assessments, vulnerability scans, or penetration testing of its networks and databases. Lastly, the FTC’s complaint asserted that the company failed to assess or enforce compliance of its written information security standards and policies. According to the FTC, these combined failures allowed an unauthorized actor to hack into Verkada’s platform in March 2021, gaining access to security camera footage a limited number of customers.\n\nThe agency sought redress for what it claimed was a substantial injury to consumers in the form of exposure of their personal information and by the invasion of their privacy, especially for those in sensitive settings such as hospital rooms and schools.\n\nSecurity Misrepresentations\n\nThe agency scrutinized Verkada’s representations about its information security practices and considered them to be false and misleading. In a 2018 press release, Verkada reassured customers of the strength of its security products, stating “Verkada offers a range of benefits, including stronger data security…” The complaint also referenced the company’s webpage, which made numerous claims regarding information security practices.\n\nAccording to the FTC, Verkada made multiple misleading statements such as “Verkada devices are compliant against some of the strictest data handling and security standards in the world” and Verkada was “[f]ully HIPAA compliant” (when, in fact, Verkada’s products were not).\n\nThe FTC’s complaint also found issues with Verkada’s representation that it was Privacy Shield certified. Though no longer in effect as a valid data transfer mechanism for personal data from the EU to the US, companies that were previously registered under Privacy Shield are still responsible for the promises they made at the time related to their certification. In this case, the FTC was focused on this specific Privacy Shield principle:\n\n“SECURITY [Principle 4]: (a) Organizations creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating personal information must take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect it from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal data.”\n\nThe agency contended that Verkada made multiple false statements, including written statements that Verkada achieved the Privacy Shield certification on its web page as of December 2022.\n\nFalse and Misleading Online Reviews\n\nAccording to the complaint, individuals associated with Verkada wrote online reviews on the company’s Google Maps profile without disclosing their relationship to the company. The agency claimed that Verkada was aware of these reviews and that they omitted the reviewers’ ties to the company (including a venture capital investor of Verkada). The FTC’s complaint further asserted that Verkada had encouraged some employees to post these reviews.\n\nCAN-SPAM Violations\n\nThe complaint further alleges that Verkada failed to honor opt-out requests, provide notice of opt-out requests or a valid physical postal address in its email marketing communications. At issue is that Verkada’s email marketing campaigns failed to abide by the CAN-SPAM Act, a 2004 law protecting consumers from unfair email marketing tactics. The CAN-SPAM Act also makes it illegal to initiate email marketing without a clear and conspicuous opt-out. The law forces companies to honor opt-out requests within 10-business days after receipt of such a request, which Verkada allegedly failed to do.\n\nII.Stipulated Order\n\nUnder the stipulated order, Verkada was required to pay a $2.95 million monetary fine for the alleged CAN-SPAM violations, the highest monetary penalty ever for a CAN-SPAM violation. Verkada also agreed to the following terms in the order:\n\nPermanent Injunction of Data Security Practices\n\nA prohibition against misrepresentations concerning privacy, security, confidentiality of consumer data, compliance programs including HIPAA compliance, independence of endorser or reviewers of a business product or service.\n\nA Requirement to Implement a Comprehensive Privacy Program\n\nFollowing the trend in other recent FTC orders, Verkada is required to develop and implement a comprehensive information security program with biennial third-party oversight for 20 years. To safeguard personal information and customer information, the program must be documented in writing, provided to the board of directors or equivalent governing body, and overseen by a designated qualified employee. Independent third-party assessors will annually review the program’s effectiveness. Furthermore, material program evaluations or updates are required within 30 days of a covered incident. A covered incident occurs when information of or about an individual consumer was, or is reasonably believed to have been, accessed, acquired, or publicly exposed without authorization. After a covered incident, Verkada will submit a report to the Federal Trade Commission within 10 days.\n\nThe order also requires all employees to complete annual mandatory training on how to safeguard personal information and customer information. Verkada will be required to implement controls monitoring its networks to identify and respond to anomalous activity and unauthorized attempts to access or exfiltrate personal information and customer data. Verkada has agreed to provide the agency with annual updates of its satisfaction with the order requirements for 20 years.\n\nEnjoined from Unlawful Commercial Email Practices\n\nFinally, the order prohibits Verkada from violating Section 5 of the CAN-SPAM Act, or otherwise not complying with the requirements to provide a physical post address, provide a notice for consumers to decline to receive email messages, and honor email opt-out requests in connection with email marketing or advertising.\n\nIII.Key Takeaways\n\n1. The FTC continues to enforce data security violations.\n\nWhile many of the FTC’s recent enforcement actions have focused on “privacy” violations (e.g., the disclosure of sensitive data to third parties for advertising purposes), this decision shows that the FTC isn’t turning a blind eye to security violations, especially if the inadequate security leads to a data breach. Companies should pay attention to recent FTC settlement orders regarding data security and assess whether their practices live up to the FTC’s expectations, as well as to the promises they are making to consumers about their security. This latter point is especially important if a company is claiming to adhere to a specific security standard, such as the HIPAA Security Rule.\n\n2. The FTC will continue to focus its enforcement actions where a company’s data practices potentially lead to the compromise of sensitive data.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the FTC targeted a company that provides products with access to personal information from privacy-sensitive facilities, such as psychiatric hospitals and women’s health clinics. Through this order, the FTC adds insight into what the agency considers to be sensitive information that merits heightened protection. According to the agreed to information security program requirements, the appropriate level of data protection should be based on “the volume and sensitivity of the data at risk.” In this case, the FTC contends allowing a hacker to access internet-connected security cameras and view patients in psychiatric hospitals and women’s health clinics evidenced a failure to safeguard particularly sensitive information.\n\n3. CAN-SPAM still matters.\n\nThis is the FTC’s third CAN-SPAM related enforcement action or lawsuit in the last two years. While the agency hasn’t historically focused its attention on the law, this recent trend may indicate that this is becoming an area of focus for the agency. Companies should closely review their email marketing practices in light of these actions.\n\n4. Privacy Shield also (still) matters.\n\nPrivacy Shield being replaced by the Data Privacy Framework isn’t stopping the FTC from enforcing the historical promises companies made under the old data transfer framework. Companies should keep this in mind as a potential enforcement risk.",

As of now, Verkada has raised over $460 million in funding and operates 16 offices across three continents, employing more than 1,900 full-time staff and serving over 25,000 customers in over 70 countries [(Verkada, 2024)](https://www.verkada.com/tags/company-news/).\n\n## Recent Developments\n### FTC Settlement\nOn August 30, 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a proposed settlement with Verkada, requiring the company to pay a $2.95 million penalty due to allegations of inadequate data security practices and violations of the CAN-SPAM Act. The FTC's complaint highlighted that Verkada failed to implement reasonable security measures, which allowed unauthorized access to sensitive customer data, including live camera feeds from locations such as psychiatric hospitals and schools [(FTC, 2024)](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/08/ftc-takes-action-against-security-camera-firm-verkada-over-charges-it-failed-secure-videos-other). The settlement mandates that Verkada develop a comprehensive information security program and undergo regular third-party audits for 20 years [(DOJ, 2024)](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/295m-penalty-and-permanent-injunction-resolves-lawsuit-against-verkada-inc-alleged-unlawful).\n\n### New Product Developments\nVerkada has recently introduced AI-powered alerts and expanded integrations, alongside next-generation cameras, intercoms, and door readers at its annual event, VerkadaOne. This innovation aims to enhance the security capabilities of its product offerings [(Verkada, 2024)](https://www.verkada.com/tags/company-news/).\n\n### Partnerships\nIn June 2024, Verkada announced a partnership with Zchwantech SDN BHD, which will act as an authorized reseller of Verkada's products in Malaysia. This collaboration aims to enhance operational efficiency and safety for clients by providing advanced cloud-based security solutions [(Zchwantech, 2024)](https://blog.zchwantech.com/exciting-partnership-announcement-zchwantech-partners-with-verkada-to-bring-more-advanced-security-solutions-to-our-customers/).\n\n## Financial Overview\nVerkada has successfully closed a Series D funding round, raising $305 million, which contributes to its total funding exceeding $460 million. This financial backing supports its rapid expansion and product development initiatives [(Verkada, 2024)](https://www.verkada.com/blog/verkada-series-d-extension/).\n\n## Executive Leadership\nVerkada has recently appointed Mauricio Ramirez as the new Vice President of North America Corporate Enterprise Sales, indicating a strategic move to bolster its sales efforts in a competitive market [(Verkada, 2024)](https://www.verkada.com/tags/company-news/).\n\n## Product Quality and Customer Feedback\nVerkada's products are designed for simplicity and scalability, providing organizations with real-time insights to enhance safety and minimize security risks. However, the recent FTC settlement raises concerns about the company's previous claims regarding data security and compliance with regulations such as HIPAA and the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield [(Kessler & Ross, 2024)](https://www.dataprotectionreport.com/2024/09/security-cameras-can-spam-and-reasonable-or-appropriate-security/). The FTC's findings suggest that Verkada's security practices were not as robust as advertised, which could impact customer trust and future sales.\n\n## Market Position and Scale\nVerkada's market position is significant, with over 25,000 customers, including sensitive sectors like healthcare and education. The company has sold over 240,000 cameras linked to its platform, which allows for remote access to surveillance footage [(Kirk et al., 2024)](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/blogs/wilmerhale-privacy-and-cybersecurity-law/20240930-ftc-penalizes-cloudbased-physical-security-company-for-data-security-and-canspam-violations). Despite the recent legal challenges, Verkada's extensive customer base and innovative product offerings position it as a leader in the physical security market.\n\n## Conclusion\nVerkada Inc. is a prominent player in the cloud-based security industry, with a strong product lineup and a growing customer base. However, the recent FTC settlement regarding data security practices poses challenges that could affect its reputation and operational strategies. Prospective candidates and investors should consider both the company's innovative capabilities and the implications of its legal challenges when evaluating its future potential. \n\nFor further details, please refer to the original sources cited throughout this report."
