This breach raised concerns about the company's data security practices, particularly as it involved sensitive locations like psychiatric hospitals and schools [(Verkada Settles FTC Probe of Hack Exposing Tesla, Hospitals, 2024)](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/verkada-settles-ftc-probe-of-hack-exposing-tesla-hospitals-1). Following the breach, Verkada implemented several security measures, including mandatory two-factor authentication for support staff and increased transparency with customers regarding security practices [(Wikipedia, 2020)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkada).\n\nOn August 30, 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a proposed settlement with Verkada, requiring the company to pay a $2.95 million penalty and implement a comprehensive information security program. This settlement addresses allegations that Verkada failed to secure customer data adequately, allowing hackers to access sensitive information, including live feeds from over 150,000 security cameras in various sensitive locations such as hospitals and schools [(FTC Takes Action Against Security Camera Firm Verkada, 2024)](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/08/ftc-takes-action-against-security-camera-firm-verkada-over-charges-it-failed-secure-videos-other) [(DOJ and FTC Secure $2.95 Million Settlement for Alleged CAN-SPAM Act Violations, 2024)](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/doj-and-ftc-secure-2-95-million-3917195/).\n\n## New Product Developments\n\nVerkada has been actively expanding its product offerings.

As of December 2024, the company is reportedly raising $200 million at a valuation of $4.5 billion, reflecting a substantial increase in investor confidence despite the recent regulatory challenges [(Wikipedia, 2020)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkada) [(Security Camera Startup Verkada in Talks for $4.5 Billion Valuation, 2024)](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/12/13/security-camera-startup-verkada-in-talks-for-45-billion-valuation/).\n\n## Leadership and Company Culture\n\nVerkada has faced criticism regarding its workplace culture, particularly allegations of a \"bro\" culture and inadequate security practices.

The hardware is very good, but the software has so many holes. We spent tens of thousands of dollars on this and are disappointed. Examples: Video intercom does not show who is at the door until you answer it (defeats the whole purpose & video doorbells under $100 do this!). There is no distinct ringtone for the door intercoms, so when someone presses the doorbell, you have to find out which door they are at. Notifications are a mess. No picture is shown (except in text messages). You can’t easily mute the notifications. The notifications are not according to Apple’s standard. You need a license for everything & they are expensive! You need a separate AppleTV to view the video feeds as their previous iPad app is deprecated. There is no Apple Watch app (which would be so helpful!). There was no helpful introduction or setting up of devices. No developer response to Apple Store complaints. No Face ID for security so you have to keep logging in. I could name 100 things that are missing or poorly implemented. A greatly missed opportunity.",

The hardware is very good, but the software has so many holes. We spent tens of thousands of dollars on this and are disappointed. Examples: Video intercom does not show who is at the door until you answer it (defeats the whole purpose & video doorbells under $100 do this!). There is no distinct ringtone for the door intercoms, so when someone presses the doorbell, you have to find out which door they are at. Notifications are a mess. No picture is shown (except in text messages). You can’t easily mute the notifications. The notifications are not according to Apple’s standard. You need a license for everything & they are expensive! You need a separate AppleTV to view the video feeds as their previous iPad app is deprecated. There is no Apple Watch app (which would be so helpful!). There was no helpful introduction or setting up of devices. No developer response to Apple Store complaints. No Face ID for security so you have to keep logging in. I could name 100 things that are missing or poorly implemented. A greatly missed opportunity.",

But if you want to go with them my suggestion is starting from scratch and not doing a system transfer or upgrade. That means pay for the labor to pull all new wire to devices and demo the existing one. Doing this can actually save money in the long run. \nVerkada is easy to install and easy to program and use but only if the installer is the one doing the work from start to finish.\nTheir products are trash and half the time need to be returned and replaced once right out of the box so when a general bid is at 2 weeks it will probably be more like 3 because of all the random stuff going on.\nVerkada support is great because they are always available when you need them. But there is a disconnect between IT and the Installer/electrical side when trying to explain the issues that can arise. \nMake sure the network is also dedicated as there are many times when Verkada systems no longer connect with the network because it turns some systems (not all of them) need a dedicated network and some don’t. \nThere are pros and cons to every system. I’m personally not a fan of Verkada equipment and systems because they are cheap for the price being paid, and Axis can do all the same cloud based stuff with added controllers. So depends on what you want to do.\n\n## Comment ID lm9d4p7 with +1 score by [(Ok_Energy2010, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/accesscontrol/comments/1fayo1d/verkada/lm9d4p7/) (in reply to ID 1fayo1d):\nGo cloud based with Brivo & Eagle Eye Networks.  Easy to implement, use Google and Apple wallet to store credentials and have Access and Video all in one platform.\n\n## Comment ID lm9vhbk with +1 score by [(Wolverine_SmushyFace, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/accesscontrol/comments/1fayo1d/verkada/lm9vhbk/) (in reply to ID 1fayo1d):\nAt the end of the day, it’s whatever the customer wants most, budget pending. You can inform and educate on every pitfall of each ACS and still end up with the customer choosing the polar opposite. Lots of great choices out there, some definitely better than others, but customers are a wily bunch.\n\n## Comment ID lmb39g4 with +1 score by [(TheMAN0215, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/accesscontrol/comments/1fayo1d/verkada/lmb39g4/) (in reply to ID 1fayo1d):\nHanwha Wave Server and PDK access control may be a good option for you. They integrate."

There is no distinct ringtone for the door intercoms, so when someone presses the doorbell, you have to find out which door they are at. Notifications are a mess. No picture is shown (except in text messages). You can’t easily mute the notifications. The notifications are not according to Apple’s standard. You need a license for everything & they are expensive! You need a separate AppleTV to view the video feeds as their previous iPad app is deprecated. There is no Apple Watch app (which would be so helpful!). There was no helpful introduction or setting up of devices. No developer response to Apple Store complaints. No Face ID for security so you have to keep logging in. I could name 100 things that are missing or poorly implemented. A greatly missed opportunity.",

The role primarily involves facilitating camera demonstrations rather than direct sales. The real selling is performed by partners, who manage site visits, in-person meetings, and other key activities. If assigned a less favorable territory, you may find it challenging to achieve your targets. Partners exert significant control over deals, and your role often involves merely checking in on deal status and providing updated quotes. Yes you are traveling to these territories as well its all paid for by the company, but most of the visits you are either kissing partners butts with lunch and dinners or begging customers for purchase orders. Thats what you 6 hour plane ride consists of, very degrading.\n\nWhile you can arrange meetings between partners and customers, your role is largely intermediary. Success in this position can be heavily influenced by territory and luck, as previous reps may have already exhausted key contacts. Meeting sales quotas often relies on renewals or deals brought in by partners rather than your own efforts. It’s also challenging to prospect new business due to prior outreach by other representatives. They don't explain this to you during interviews (but why would they, you probably wouldn't take the position) so the turnover rate is very high. People will not return to work. One day you'll see Fred or Sarah and then days and weeks will go by and you will never see them again. You will have to learn from other employees that Fred or Sarah was either fired for \"unknown\" reasons or they quit.\n\nIn some cases, individuals may achieve their quotas with minimal effort if they receive high-value deals from partners. Recognition is often given to those who benefit from such opportunities, even if their contribution to securing the deal was limited. The emphasis in this role is more on managing communications and relationships with partners rather than driving direct sales outcomes.\n\nIf you are on the cooperate side of the company, your quota first qtr can be as high as 100k-125k. Sled side is given a smaller quota, seeing as their deals take longer to come in, around 40k-60k. If you are looking to be promoted within these fields, they expect you to hit multiple times in a row on your quota, extremely unrealistic expectations.",

Regularly check in with teams, ensure workloads are manageable, and recognize employees’ contributions.\n\nImprove Communication: Establish clear communication channels across departments and ensure that expectations for each role are clearly defined. Transparent communication fosters trust and efficiency.\n\nRevamp Onboarding and Training: Provide a structured onboarding process for all departments, not just sales. Equip new hires with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed in their roles from day one.\n\nInvest in Leadership Development: Train managers to be effective leaders, not just task managers. Empathy, mentorship, and clear direction are key to a successful management team.\n\nEmbrace Diversity and Inclusion: Make a real commitment to diversity by actively hiring women, people of color, and individuals of varying ages. Cultivate a culture of inclusion where everyone can thrive, regardless of their background.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "My experience at this company has been overwhelmingly negative. The leadership, across all departments, shows little to no care for their employees. Although I wasn’t in sales, I worked closely with the Mid-Market and Enterprise teams, where the environment is stressful and the expectations are unreasonable. The teams face extremely high quotas, zero guidance, and absurd working hours.\n\nUnfortunately, the issues extend beyond the sales department. I've witnessed or heard concerning things from every corner of the organization. There is a sense of favoritism at the top, with many being friends or romantically involved. This creates an atmosphere where accountability is nonexistent, and it feels like there’s no safe place to voice concerns.\n\nEmployee wellbeing seems to be an afterthought. The company is focused solely on selling their product and making money, often at the expense of its people. Compensation is well below industry standards for most roles, and even long-term employees who meet or exceed expectations are rarely rewarded. Instead, they are often criticized or undermined.\n\nCommunication is a major issue here. There’s virtually no transparency when it comes to company-wide updates or information directly related to your role. Onboarding is minimal at best, especially for non-sales employees, leaving most people to figure things out on their own.\n\nThe management is poorly trained and often lacks the skills needed to lead effectively. The culture is cliquey and feels very much like a frat house environment. Despite claims of valuing diversity and inclusion, the company seems to actively avoid hiring women, people of color, or older candidates.",

It was a great shame for his managers to do this since he had helped solve almost all the critical issues for the product before its launch, and then he was suddenly let go. Some higher level people spoiled the EPMs for no reason, and one or two of these EPMs who was or is still on the team is the root cause of such toxic vibes. This includes, but is not limited to, talking behind someone's back and creating dramas. Another engineer left due to lack of supervision and mentoring, which is something you might expect when you join this company.

        "cons": "If you are seeking a role that allows you to fully utilize your sales skills, this position may not align with your goals. The role primarily involves facilitating camera demonstrations rather than direct sales. The real selling is performed by partners, who manage site visits, in-person meetings, and other key activities. If assigned a less favorable territory, you may find it challenging to achieve your targets. Partners exert significant control over deals, and your role often involves merely checking in on deal status and providing updated quotes. Yes you are traveling to these territories as well its all paid for by the company, but most of the visits you are either kissing partners butts with lunch and dinners or begging customers for purchase orders. Thats what you 6 hour plane ride consists of, very degrading.\n\nWhile you can arrange meetings between partners and customers, your role is largely intermediary. Success in this position can be heavily influenced by territory and luck, as previous reps may have already exhausted key contacts. Meeting sales quotas often relies on renewals or deals brought in by partners rather than your own efforts. It’s also challenging to prospect new business due to prior outreach by other representatives. They don't explain this to you during interviews (but why would they, you probably wouldn't take the position) so the turnover rate is very high. People will not return to work. One day you'll see Fred or Sarah and then days and weeks will go by and you will never see them again. You will have to learn from other employees that Fred or Sarah was either fired for \"unknown\" reasons or they quit.\n\nIn some cases, individuals may achieve their quotas with minimal effort if they receive high-value deals from partners. Recognition is often given to those who benefit from such opportunities, even if their contribution to securing the deal was limited. The emphasis in this role is more on managing communications and relationships with partners rather than driving direct sales outcomes.\n\nIf you are on the cooperate side of the company, your quota first qtr can be as high as 100k-125k. Sled side is given a smaller quota, seeing as their deals take longer to come in, around 40k-60k. If you are looking to be promoted within these fields, they expect you to hit multiple times in a row on your quota, extremely unrealistic expectations.",

The teams face extremely high quotas, zero guidance, and absurd working hours.\n\nUnfortunately, the issues extend beyond the sales department. I've witnessed or heard concerning things from every corner of the organization. There is a sense of favoritism at the top, with many being friends or romantically involved. This creates an atmosphere where accountability is nonexistent, and it feels like there’s no safe place to voice concerns.\n\nEmployee wellbeing seems to be an afterthought. The company is focused solely on selling their product and making money, often at the expense of its people. Compensation is well below industry standards for most roles, and even long-term employees who meet or exceed expectations are rarely rewarded. Instead, they are often criticized or undermined.\n\nCommunication is a major issue here. There’s virtually no transparency when it comes to company-wide updates or information directly related to your role. Onboarding is minimal at best, especially for non-sales employees, leaving most people to figure things out on their own.\n\nThe management is poorly trained and often lacks the skills needed to lead effectively.

      "# [FTC Takes Action Against Security Camera Firm Verkada over Charges it Failed to Secure Videos, Other Personal Data and Violated CAN-SPAM Act on 2024-08-30](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/08/ftc-takes-action-against-security-camera-firm-verkada-over-charges-it-failed-secure-videos-other)\nThe Federal Trade Commission will require security camera firm Verkada to develop and implement a comprehensive information security program to settle allegations the company failed to use appropriate information security practices, which allowed a hacker to access customers’ security cameras.\n\nUnder a proposed order, which must be approved by a federal judge before it can go into effect, Verkada will also be required to pay a $2.95 million monetary penalty to settle allegations the company inundated prospective customers with commercial emails in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act, the largest penalty obtained by the FTC for a CAN-SPAM violation.\n\nA complaint filed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) upon notification and referral from the FTC, alleged that Verkada failed to use appropriate information security practices to protect consumers’ personal information, which allowed a hacker to access internet-connected security cameras and view patients in psychiatric hospitals and women’s health clinics. The complaint also charged that Verkada was aware that employees and a venture capital investor posted positive ratings and reviews of Verkada and its products but failed to disclose their association or current employment status with Verkada.\n\nThe complaint also alleged that Verkada violated the CAN-SPAM Act (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing) by flooding prospective customers with a barrage of commercial emails and failing to include the option to unsubscribe or opt-out, honor opt-out requests, and provide a physical postal address in the emails.\n\n“When customers invite companies into private spaces to monitor consumers by using their security cameras and other products, they expect those companies to provide basic levels of security, which Verkada failed to do,” said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “Companies that fail to secure and protect consumer data can expect to be held responsible.”\n\n“This settlement underscores the importance of robust data security measures, especially for companies that are themselves in the security industry. Failure to protect sensitive information puts consumers at risk,” said Brian M. Boynton, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “We will continue to work with the FTC to hold companies accountable for such violations.”\n\nCalifornia-based Verkada sells IP-enabled security cameras and other physical security offerings to thousands of customers, both in the United States and overseas, including those that operate from sensitive locations like schools and hospitals. In its privacy policy, press releases, blog posts and other materials, Verkada claimed it takes data security and customer privacy seriously. For example, in its privacy policy in 2018, the company claimed it uses “best-in-class data security tools and best practices to keep your data safe and protect the Verkada Products from unauthorized access.”\n\nThe complaint alleges that despite such claims, Verkada failed to provide appropriate security measures to protect the personal information it collects, which includes sensitive video footage from its security cameras as well as data about customer accounts such as names, email addresses, passwords and site floorplans. For example, the company failed to require unique and complex passwords, adequately encrypt customer data, and implement secure network controls.\n\nAs a result of these security failures, the complaint alleges, the company experienced at least two security breaches between December 2020 and March 2021. In the March 2021 breach, the hacker had access to over 150,000 live Verkada customer cameras as well as other customer information, such as physical addresses, audio recordings, and customer WiFi credentials.\n\nAdditionally, Verkada misled consumers with respect to its compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. According to the complaint, Verkada’s security practices were not compliant with either HIPAA or either Privacy Shield framework.\n\nThe complaint further alleges that Verkada also misled consumers by failing to disclose that certain online consumer ratings and reviews of its camera products were written by Verkada employees and a venture capital investor, according to the complaint. For example, a venture capitalist who invested in Verkada posted a five-star rating and positive review on Google Maps.\n\nLastly, the complaint alleges that Verkada violated the CAN-SPAM Act in several ways. According to the complaint, Verkada relied on commercial email campaigns to help market its products, sending more than 30 million commercial emails over a three-year period. Verkada’s commercial emails violated the CAN-SPAM Act in four ways, including not honoring email recipients’ requests to unsubscribe.\n\nIn addition to the monetary penalty, the proposed order also will prohibit the company from making misrepresentations about Verkada’s privacy and data security practices and require it to implement a comprehensive information security program with third-party audits. The proposed order also will prohibit Verkada from violating the CAN-SPAM Act.\n\nThe Commission voted 5-0 to refer the complaint and stipulated order to DOJ. The DOJ filed the complaint and stipulated order in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District California. Commissioner Melissa Holyoak issued a separate concurring statement.\n\nNOTE: The Commission authorizes the filing of a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the named defendant is violating or is about to violate the law and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. Stipulated orders have the force of law when approved and signed by the District Court judge.\n\nThe lead staff attorneys on this matter are Jacqueline Ford and Kamay Lafalaise from the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection.",

      "# [$2.95M Penalty and Permanent Injunction Resolves Lawsuit Against Verkada Inc. for Alleged Unlawful Commercial Emails, Data Security Failures and Deceptive Practices on 2024-09-04](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/295m-penalty-and-permanent-injunction-resolves-lawsuit-against-verkada-inc-alleged-unlawful)\nThe Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced today that Verkada Inc. (Verkada), a cloud-based security company headquartered in San Mateo, California, has agreed to a settlement requiring it to pay a $2.95 million civil penalty and implement extensive data security measures. This settlement resolves allegations that Verkada violated the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Act and engaged in unfair and deceptive practices in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act.\n\nIn a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the United States alleges that Verkada failed to implement reasonable security measures such as appropriate access management and data protection controls and adequate encryption of customer data. These failures allegedly exposed sensitive information — including security-camera footage of consumers visiting locations like hospitals and schools — to unauthorized access. The complaint additionally alleges that Verkada misrepresented the extent to which it used appropriate data security safeguards and complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). The complaint also alleges that Verkada sent numerous promotional emails that failed to clearly and conspicuously notify recipients of their opportunity to opt out of such messages and failed to include a valid physical postal address, and that Verkada did not honor requests to opt out from its promotional emails within ten business days of receiving those requests, all in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act.\n\nTo resolve the lawsuit, the parties agreed to a settlement reflected by the stipulated order issued today by the Court. The stipulated order requires Verkada to pay a $2.95 million civil penalty and to comply with the CAN-SPAM Act, including by honoring requests to opt out of its commercial emails. The stipulated order also prohibits Verkada from misrepresenting its data security practices and requires it to establish a comprehensive information security program and undergo regular third-party assessments of its data security practices.\n\n“This settlement underscores the importance of robust data security measures, especially for companies that are themselves in the security industry. Failure to protect sensitive information puts consumers at risk,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “We will continue to work with the FTC to hold companies accountable for such violations.”\n\n“When customers invite companies into private spaces to monitor consumers by using their security cameras and other products, they expect those companies to provide basic levels of security, which Verkada failed to do,” said Director Samuel Levin of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “Companies that fail to secure and protect consumer data can expect to be held responsible.”\n\nTrial Attorneys Cameron A. Brown and Amanda K. Kelly, Senior Trial Attorney James T. Nelson and Assistant Director Zachary A. Dietert of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Vivian Wang for the Northern District of California are handling the case, in coordination with staff from the FTC’s Division of Privacy and Identity Protection.",
      "# [Wikipedia by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2020-08-21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkada)\nCloud-based physical security startup\n\nVerkada Inc. is an American security technology company, based in San Mateo, California. The company combines security equipment such as video cameras, access control systems and environmental sensors, with cloud based machine vision and artificial intelligence.[2][3]\n\nThe company was founded in 2016.[4] In 2021, it was the target of a data breach that accessed security camera footage and private data.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nVerkada Inc. was founded in 2016 in Menlo Park, California by three Stanford University graduates: Filip Kaliszan, James Ren, and Benjamin Bercovitz, who were joined by Hans Robertson, co-founder and former COO of Meraki (now Cisco Meraki). Kaliszan, Ren, and Bercovitz had previously collaborated on CourseRank, a class data aggregation platform that was acquired by Chegg in 2010.[4]\n\nVerkada exited the beta development stage in September 2017, with a product offering of two camera models.\n\nIn 2019, Forbes included Verkada in its Next Billion Dollar Startups list, as well as that year's AI 50 list of most promising artificial intelligence companies.[5][6] In April, the company announced a $40 million Series B funding round, which valued the company at $540 million.[4]\n\nIn January 2020, the company raised $80 million in a Series C funding found led by Felicis Ventures, giving the company a $1.6 billion valuation.[2] In spring 2020, the company launched its first access control device, the first move in a shift to moving beyond cameras, and integrating security cameras and locks onto a single platform.[2] In June during the COVID-19 crisis Verkada instituted a program to offer free surveillance kits to businesses and healthcare institutions in order to remotely monitor high-risk locations.[7] It also added features to let customers detect when crowds are forming, and to identify high traffic areas that might need more cleaning.[8] In September, the company launched a line of integrated environmental sensors.[9] In September, it introduced a line of environmental sensors for facilities monitoring.[7]\n\nIn April 2021, news site Bloomberg News reported allegations by former employees accusing the company of having a \"bro\" culture, with lax device security, excessive focus on profit, and parties during the COVID-19 pandemic.[10] In the Bloomberg reporting, Verkada acknowledged an internal lapse in judgment, and was reportedly working to create a more inclusive work environment, including reviewing gender pay equity and implementing better training.[10] In September, the company began donating security cameras to Asian Pacific American business communities, starting with the Oakland California Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, to address growing anti-Asian threats and violence against its members.[11]\n\nIn August 2022, the company announced a mailroom product to help companies keep track of mail packages and shipments coming into their facilities.[12] In September, the company raised $205 million in Series D funding, bringing its valuation to $3.2 billion.[13] Despite the data breach it suffered in 2021, the company continued its expansion. In October 2023 it managed to close a $305 million funding round with participation from Lightspeed and shortly after the injection of $100 million by Alkeon Capital.[14]\n\nIn September 2024, Verkada was sued by the United States Department of Justice for violating the CAN-SPAM Act.[15]\n\nData breach\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 8, 2021, Verkada was hacked by an international group including maia arson crimew and calling themselves the \"APT - 69420 Arson Cats,\" which gained access to their network for about 36 hours and collected about 5 gigabytes of data.[16][failed verification]\n\nInitially, it was reported that the scope of the incident included live and recorded security camera footage from more than 150,000 cameras. It was later reported that 95 customers' video and images data were accessed[17][18][19] Crimew told Bloomberg News that the hack \"exposes just how broadly we're being surveilled\".[20]\n\nIn response to the data breach, in April 2021 it was reported that Verkada CEO Filip Kaliszan announced a series of measures, including red team/blue team exercises, a bug bounty program, mandatory two-factor authentication use by Verkada support staff, and the sharing of more audit logs with Verkada customers.[21]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2021, Motorola Solutions filed a 52-page complaint[22] against Verkada with the United States International Trade Commission, alleging that Verkada cameras and software infringe upon patents held by Motorola subsidiary Avigilon.[23][24] Verkada subsequently filed a lawsuit against Motorola Solutions in the California Northern District Court in September 2021,[25][26][27] arguing that Motorola has \"sought to effectively shut Verkada’s business down.\"[28][27] Later in September, the International Trade Commission initiated its investigation into Motorola's complaint,[29] with Verkada stating in its response that it does not infringe upon any of Motorola's patents.[30]\n\nOn October 24, 2022, the presiding administrative law judge (“ALJ”) of the ITC issued a final initial determination (“FID”) finding that a violation of section 337 has occurred, that Verkada's products infringed claims 6–11 of 1 of 3 patents asserted by Motorola, but no infringement with respect to the other asserted claims of the 1 patent and the claims of other 2 patents.[31] Both Verkada and Motorola filed for ITC review of the FID.[31] On April 4, 2023, ITC issued a final determination and terminated the ITC investigation, finding that Verkada products did not infringe any of Motorola's 3 patents.[31]\n\nVerkada uses facial recognition in its cameras, including systems installed in public housing. Independent testing showed a 15-85% false positive rate in the matches.[32] The use of surveillance cameras equipped with facial recognition technology ends up affecting the daily lives of residents in poor neighbourhoods and public housing areas[citation needed]. Their use makes their existence even more difficult and complicated, and there is no evidence of their usefulness in reducing crime.[32][33] Facial recognition has been outlawed in Illinois and Texas and has been under scrutiny by HUD.[32]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",

      "# [Security cameras, CAN-SPAM, and “reasonable or appropriate security” by David Kessler (US), Susan Ross (US) on 2024-09-09](https://www.dataprotectionreport.com/2024/09/security-cameras-can-spam-and-reasonable-or-appropriate-security/)\nOn August 30, 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a proposed settlement with security camera manufacturer Verkada Inc., claiming Verkada committed a variety of unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and CAN-SPAM in connection with a security breach. (The U.S. Department of Justice filed that complaint and proposed stipulated joint order on behalf of the FTC.) Verkada does not admit or deny the claims (Order, para. 4).\n\nBackground\n\nAccording to the complaint, Verkada developed and sold security cameras and other surveillance products to businesses, including schools and medical facilities. Between 2019 and 2021, Verkada sold over 240,000 cameras, which were linked to Verkada’s platform, which enabled customers to have remote access to the cameras and stored surveillance footage. Verkada collected metadata about the security camera usage (including IP addresses and locations) as well as customer names, addresses, usernames and passwords, site floorplans, names of organizational contacts and Wi-Fi credentials.\n\nThe video cameras collected images of individuals, including patients and schoolchildren, as well as sensitive personal information (including medical records). The complaint states that Verkada offered its customers “People Analytics,” which allowed customers to search through video images collected for gender, clothing color, and/or to use facial recognition.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Verkada’s website made several claims about its security practices, including claims that it was HIPAA certified and compliant with the EU-US Privacy Shield. The complaint alleges the Verkada sent out large numbers of commercial emails, but did not include functional opt-out features, and also did not honor opt-outs it did receive. The complaint also claims that Verkada also did not include a clear and conspicuous opportunity to opt-out in emails and did not consistently include a physical postal address.\n\nParagraph 20 of the complaint asserts that Verkada did not take reasonable measures to secure the customer and consumer data, listing “Defendant’s information security failures” as follows:\n\na. Impose reasonable access management controls such as:\n\ni. requiring unique and complex passwords (i.e., long passwords not used by the individual for any other online service);\n\nii. enforcing role-based access controls to safeguard personal information, such as implementing the principle of least privilege and requiring multi-factor authentication for account access across all of Defendant’s systems;\n\niii. issuing alerts for activities, such as unsuccessful logins to administrative accounts and the addition or removal of any account with administrative privileges;\n\nb. Prevent data loss by establishing data protection controls, such as:\n\ni. performing data discovery and categorization for all sensitive personal information to ensure it is appropriately protected during transmission and storage;\n\nii. implementing a data loss prevention solution that monitors for suspicious activities such as unauthorized data access and exfiltration; and\n\niii. performing regular assessments to determine the effectiveness of protection measures;\n\nc. Implement centralized logging and alerting capabilities;\n\nd. Develop adequate security vulnerability management standards, policies, procedures, and practices such as:\n\ni. testing, auditing, assessing, or reviewing its products, or applications; security features; and\n\nii. conducting regular risk assessments, vulnerability scans, and penetration testing of its networks and databases;\n\ne. Implement secure network controls, such as disabling unnecessary ports, protocols, and services, and properly configuring firewall settings;\n\nf. Adequately encrypt customer’s data in transit or at rest; and\n\ng. Develop adequate written information security standards, policies, procedures, and practices; assess or enforce compliance with the written standards, policies, procedures, and practices that it did have; and implement training for employees (including engineers) regarding such standards, policies, procedures and practices.\n\nParagraph 3 of the complaint states that these “failures allowed a threat actor to access Defendant’s customer support accounts, view customer cameras, and access personal information relating to customers and consumers.”\n\nThe complaint included two counts of unfair information security practices in violation of § 5 of the FTC Act (one count for consumers and one for business customers); and five counts of deception in violation of § 5 (two counts of information security misrepresentations; one for HIPAA compliance misrepresentations; one for Privacy Shield misrepresentations; and two counts related to failure to disclose some online reviews were from individuals with “material connections” to Verkada and thus were not “impartial”). The complaint also included 3 counts relating to CAN-SPAM (failure to honor opt-outs; failure to provide notice of opt-out opportunity; and failure to provide physical postal address). CAN-SPAM includes civil penalties, and these formed the basis of the $2.95 million proposed settlement.\n\nThe proposed order contains many provisions similar to previous FTC settlements, but there are a few items that are particularly noteworthy:\n\n“Customer Information” [note this is not “consumer” information] includes not only user account credentials and email addresses, but also site floorplans, names and titles of customer contacts, Wi-Fi credentials; metadata about product usage and “access control elements, including access levels, access groups, and badge numbers.”\n\n“Personal information” includes not only names, addresses, and birthdates, but also live camera footage, video archives, still images or photos, and audio recordings.\n\nThe proposed order would last for 20 years and prohibits misrepresentations and violations of CAN-SPAM, and it would require that company implement an information security program (including someone responsible for overseeing it as well as multi-factor authentication), and third-party assessments. The proposed order contains an interesting prohibition on the third party assessor: “No finding of any Assessment shall rely primarily on assertions or attestations by Defendant’s management.”\n\nOur Take\n\nThere seems to be a trend developing among regulators, outlining the elements of “reasonable security.” This proposed judgment marks the third within two months that focuses on what is (or is not) “reasonable security.” The first settlement involved the New York Attorney General’s interpretation of New York’s SHIELD Act (see our write-up here); the second consent involved the California Attorney General’s requirements (involving Blackbaud, here); and this one is from the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nYet these three regulators, acting under very different laws, found that “reasonable security” includes all of the following elements, which certainly are not sufficient to demonstrate “reasonable security,” but all of which these regulators found to be necessary:\n\nDesignation of an individual in charge of the information security program\n\nEncryption of personal data,\n\nIntrusion detection and prevention;\n\nMulti-factor authentication,\n\nPassword management, and\n\nSegmentation/limiting access.\n\nAnd each proposed settlement included a multi-million-dollar payment.\n\nImportantly, here the FTC did not just focus on personal information of consumers, but confidential business information of Verkada’s customers. This expansion is a significant addition as breach notification laws focus entirely on personal information and, absent contract or affirmative representations, a victim of a security incident is not obligated to notify another business of the loss of their business information.",

      "# [Privacy Perils Series: Verkada Case on 2024-09-19](https://www.schwabe.com/publication/privacy-perils-what-went-wrong/)\nThe FTC’s recent enforcement action against a B2B company is a cautionary tale about ‎common, easy-to-avoid privacy, security, and marketing missteps; and a reminder that fines ‎aren’t the only consequences to fear in an enforcement action.‎\n\nIn addition to paying a $3M fine, for the next 20 years the FTC will require Verkada, Inc. to implement a comprehensive information security program, submit to third-party information security assessments, and comply with other robust administrative requirements to settle allegations that the company’s privacy, security, and marketing practices violated the law. To implement these obligations will require significant resources and investments. In the complaint filed by the Department of Justice at the FTC’s request, Verkada is alleged to have engaged in many unfair or deceptive business practices. Here are the top five, many of which are all too common:\n\nFailing to Adequately Protect Data. The complaint alleges that Verkada failed to provide reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect the personal information it collected and maintained, and that allowed a hacker to gain access to information from more than 150,000 live security cameras—including some in sensitive locations, such as psychiatric hospitals, women’s health clinics, children’s bedrooms, and prison cells. According to the complaint, reasonable and appropriate measures should have included:\n\nAccess management basics, such as the use of unique and complex passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication\n\nLogin monitoring to flag suspicious activities, such as unsuccessful logins to administrative accounts, and the addition or removal of any account with administrative privileges\n\nRegular risk assessments, vulnerability scans, and penetration testing\n\nTesting, auditing, and review of the effectiveness of security measures and services\n\nUse of encryption at rest and in transit, as well as network controls, such as properly configured firewalls\n\nDevelopment of adequate written information security standards, policies, procedures, and practices; and adequate training of employees on same\n\nMaking Misleading Statements about Data Protection Investments and Commitment. Verkada is alleged to have misrepresented its security practices in numerous ways. ‎First, their privacy policy claimed: “[W]e take customer privacy seriously” and “use best-in-class data security tools and best practices to keep your data safe.” Second, the company’s website purportedly contained misleading statements such as, “[f]rom Day 1, we’ve made technology decisions that strengthen security and … Verkada uses commercially reasonable efforts to deploy and uphold [] security best practices and standards….” Finally, in blog posts, press releases, and interviews, Verkada assured customers of the quality of its security practices and commitment to data protection. The complaint specifically references the following quote from Verkada’s CEO: “We built a system that’s end-to-end secure. That’s a huge problem with today’s systems. Verkada is secure out of the box.”\n\nMisrepresenting Privacy and Security Compliance. When Verkada marketed, promoted, advertised, and sold its products and services, the FTC claims the company frequently misrepresented it was (1) HIPAA-certified or compliant and (2) that it adhered to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield principles.\n\nSending Incessant Marketing Emails That Lacked Compliance Elements and Ignoring Customer Complaints. Verkada is alleged to have sent over 30 million promotional emails without an effective unsubscribe mechanism, and without including a valid, physical postal address in the body of the message. Email recipients repeatedly notified Verkada they didn’t want the emails, and they were unable to unsubscribe, despite multiple attempts.\n\nPosting Fake Reviews. Verkada employees and an investor purportedly violated FTC rules by posting positive online ratings and reviews without disclosing their relationship to the company or employee status, an activity which was at times encouraged. The complaint alleged that in June 2023, 35% of Google Maps ratings and reviews for Verkada were attributable to this practice, which FTC deems unlawful business.\n\nWhat are some better practices?\n\nImplement adequate security measures that take into account the types of information you process. Such measures should include technical, physical, and organizational controls designed to prevent unauthorized access to, use of, loss of, or alterations to information you process about consumers and businesses.\n\nTake stock of your data. Take inventory of the categories of personal information your company collects to ensure the information is processed lawfully. That may include analyzing many issues, such as whether personal information is being used for the purpose it was collected? Is it secured adequately, and what is the potential harm if it were disclosed improperly? How do data retention and deletion processes align with requirements and business needs?\n\nKnow Your Requirements. Ensure you understand your privacy and security obligations by identifying the laws and regulations that apply to your business, and revisit your assessments regularly, because data protection laws are proliferating.\n\nEnact policies and procedures that support your compliance needs. These could include conducting routine risk assessments and security testing, holding regular training for employees, and adopting written data practices and standards. It is common practice now to have a team and policy in place to respond to data privacy requests.\n\nBe aware of marketing pitfalls. CAN-SPAM was not on our 2024 Privacy Enforcement Bingo Card! While CAN-SPAM regulate many aspects of marketing, this enforcement action also serves as a great reminder of the many local, state, federal, and international laws that govern promotional communications (including texts and phone calls), digital advertising campaigns, and other common activities aimed to create brand awareness, generate leads, and increase demand.\n\nCommunicate Marketing Guardrails. If innovative marketing campaigns are key to your success, consider developing a marketing playbook or policy. This internal document is intended to clearly describe a company’s compliance obligations, outline prohibited activities, and establish processes and procedures to ensure the company is responsive to new rules, complaints, opt-out requests, customer concerns, and more. To provide a place to start, the FTC recently issued a final rule that addresses reviews and testimonials, and the FTC endorsement guides outline disclosure requirements in advertising.\n\nHave a Top-Notch Privacy Statement. Transparency can be an excellent risk mitigation strategy. Plus, companies often find that updating their privacy statement can expose significant risks. Those benefits are lost if the privacy statement contains privacy platitudes similar to those highlighted in the Verkada complaint. Many companies make a point to update their privacy statement at least annually to ensure that they are up to date.\n\nThe case is available here.\n\nThis article summarizes aspects of the law and does not constitute legal advice.

The new valuation is a billion-dollar jump over its previous $3.5 billion value, and the financing brings the company’s total funding raised to more than $650 million to date, according to PitchBook data.\n\nVerkada did not comment on the deal. A spokesperson for General Catalyst didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nFounded in 2016, Verkada sells internet-connected security products, including cameras equipped with facial recognition software, alarm systems and intercoms, to corporations, police departments, school districts and more, according to its website.\n\nThe shooting of UnitedHealth Group Inc. executive Brian Thompson earlier this month has driven more interest in physical safety precautions, including services like those sold by Verkada, as corporations look to enhance security measures.\n\n“Had it not been for cameras, I am not sure they would have been able to solve this,” said Verkada investor Aydin Senkut, founder of Felicis Ventures, referring to the search for Thompson’s killer. “The reality is that the only way we are going to be safer in society is if we have more cameras.”\n\nThe new funding round comes shortly after the Federal Trade Commission in August issued Verkada a $2.95 million fine for failing to implement appropriate information security practices, which allowed a hacker to access cameras inside psychiatric hospitals and women’s health clinics, the agency said in a statement.\n\nDuring the March 2021 hack, attackers gained access to 150,000 live cameras, allowing them to see inside Tesla Inc. and cybersecurity company Cloudflare Inc., and to view police interviews, Bloomberg reported.\n\nVerkada’s existing investors include First Round Capital, Next47, Sequoia Capital and Meritech Capital.\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

The breach raised concerns about the company's data security practices, particularly as it involved sensitive locations like psychiatric hospitals and schools [(Verkada Settles FTC Probe of Hack Exposing Tesla, Hospitals, 2024)](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/verkada-settles-ftc-probe-of-hack-exposing-tesla-hospitals-1). Following the breach, Verkada implemented several security measures, including mandatory two-factor authentication for support staff and increased transparency with customers regarding security practices [(Wikipedia, 2020)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkada).\n\n### New Product Developments\n\nVerkada has been actively expanding its product offerings.

The company has also engaged in community initiatives, such as donating security cameras to Asian Pacific American business communities to combat rising violence against these groups [(Verkada by Public Affairs, 2024)](https://www.verkada.com/tags/company-news/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVerkada Inc. is a rapidly growing player in the cloud-based security market, with a strong focus on integrating advanced technology into its product offerings. However, the company faces significant challenges, including regulatory scrutiny and the need to enhance its data security practices. Prospective candidates and investors should weigh the company's innovative potential against its recent controversies and the implications of its regulatory obligations. \n\nFor further details, please refer to the sources cited throughout this report."
