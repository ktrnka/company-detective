The settlement includes a $2.95 million civil penalty and mandates the implementation of extensive data security measures [(Justice Department, 2024)](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/295m-penalty-and-permanent-injunction-resolves-lawsuit-against-verkada-inc-alleged-unlawful), [(WilmerHale, 2024)](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/blogs/wilmerhale-privacy-and-cybersecurity-law/20240930-ftc-penalizes-cloudbased-physical-security-company-for-data-security-and-canspam-violations).\n\n## Financial Overview\n\nVerkada's financial growth is marked by a total of $457 million in funding, with the latest Series D round in October 2023 securing $100 million [(Tracxn, 2021)](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/verkada/__MabJwkKkg0oIExy7Z4aEaDyJpDpGhLgk1mfJDk_rdQA).

Despite its success, the company faces challenges in improving data security practices, as highlighted by recent regulatory actions. Stakeholders should weigh the company's growth potential against these operational and regulatory risks.",

The hardware is very good, but the software has so many holes. We spent tens of thousands of dollars on this and are disappointed. Examples: Video intercom does not show who is at the door until you answer it (defeats the whole purpose & video doorbells under $100 do this!). There is no distinct ringtone for the door intercoms, so when someone presses the doorbell, you have to find out which door they are at. Notifications are a mess. No picture is shown (except in text messages). You can’t easily mute the notifications. The notifications are not according to Apple’s standard. You need a license for everything & they are expensive! You need a separate AppleTV to view the video feeds as their previous iPad app is deprecated. There is no Apple Watch app (which would be so helpful!). There was no helpful introduction or setting up of devices. No developer response to Apple Store complaints. No Face ID for security so you have to keep logging in. I could name 100 things that are missing or poorly implemented. A greatly missed opportunity.",

      "# Excellent hardware, poor software, 2 stars [(frjps, Apple App Store, 2023-10-05)](https://apple/10442609136)\nI really wanted to like this. The hardware is very good, but the software has so many holes. We spent tens of thousands of dollars on this and are disappointed. Examples: Video intercom does not show who is at the door until you answer it (defeats the whole purpose & video doorbells under $100 do this!). There is no distinct ringtone for the door intercoms, so when someone presses the doorbell, you have to find out which door they are at. Notifications are a mess. No picture is shown (except in text messages). You can’t easily mute the notifications. The notifications are not according to Apple’s standard. You need a license for everything & they are expensive! You need a separate AppleTV to view the video feeds as their previous iPad app is deprecated. There is no Apple Watch app (which would be so helpful!). There was no helpful introduction or setting up of devices. No developer response to Apple Store complaints. No Face ID for security so you have to keep logging in. I could name 100 things that are missing or poorly implemented. A greatly missed opportunity.",

But if you want to go with them my suggestion is starting from scratch and not doing a system transfer or upgrade. That means pay for the labor to pull all new wire to devices and demo the existing one. Doing this can actually save money in the long run. \nVerkada is easy to install and easy to program and use but only if the installer is the one doing the work from start to finish.\nTheir products are trash and half the time need to be returned and replaced once right out of the box so when a general bid is at 2 weeks it will probably be more like 3 because of all the random stuff going on.\nVerkada support is great because they are always available when you need them. But there is a disconnect between IT and the Installer/electrical side when trying to explain the issues that can arise. \nMake sure the network is also dedicated as there are many times when Verkada systems no longer connect with the network because it turns some systems (not all of them) need a dedicated network and some don’t. \nThere are pros and cons to every system. I’m personally not a fan of Verkada equipment and systems because they are cheap for the price being paid, and Axis can do all the same cloud based stuff with added controllers. So depends on what you want to do.\n\n## Comment ID lm9d4p7 with +1 score by [(Ok_Energy2010, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/accesscontrol/comments/1fayo1d/verkada/lm9d4p7/) (in reply to ID 1fayo1d):\nGo cloud based with Brivo & Eagle Eye Networks.

There is no distinct ringtone for the door intercoms, so when someone presses the doorbell, you have to find out which door they are at. Notifications are a mess. No picture is shown (except in text messages). You can’t easily mute the notifications. The notifications are not according to Apple’s standard. You need a license for everything & they are expensive! You need a separate AppleTV to view the video feeds as their previous iPad app is deprecated. There is no Apple Watch app (which would be so helpful!). There was no helpful introduction or setting up of devices. No developer response to Apple Store complaints. No Face ID for security so you have to keep logging in. I could name 100 things that are missing or poorly implemented. A greatly missed opportunity.",

Empathy, mentorship, and clear direction are key to a successful management team.\n\nEmbrace Diversity and Inclusion: Make a real commitment to diversity by actively hiring women, people of color, and individuals of varying ages. Cultivate a culture of inclusion where everyone can thrive, regardless of their background.",

          "cons": "My experience at this company has been overwhelmingly negative. The leadership, across all departments, shows little to no care for their employees. Although I wasn’t in sales, I worked closely with the Mid-Market and Enterprise teams, where the environment is stressful and the expectations are unreasonable. The teams face extremely high quotas, zero guidance, and absurd working hours.\n\nUnfortunately, the issues extend beyond the sales department. I've witnessed or heard concerning things from every corner of the organization. There is a sense of favoritism at the top, with many being friends or romantically involved. This creates an atmosphere where accountability is nonexistent, and it feels like there’s no safe place to voice concerns.\n\nEmployee wellbeing seems to be an afterthought. The company is focused solely on selling their product and making money, often at the expense of its people. Compensation is well below industry standards for most roles, and even long-term employees who meet or exceed expectations are rarely rewarded. Instead, they are often criticized or undermined.\n\nCommunication is a major issue here. There’s virtually no transparency when it comes to company-wide updates or information directly related to your role. Onboarding is minimal at best, especially for non-sales employees, leaving most people to figure things out on their own.\n\nThe management is poorly trained and often lacks the skills needed to lead effectively. The culture is cliquey and feels very much like a frat house environment. Despite claims of valuing diversity and inclusion, the company seems to actively avoid hiring women, people of color, or older candidates.",

          "cons": "If you are seeking a role that allows you to fully utilize your sales skills, this position may not align with your goals. The role primarily involves facilitating camera demonstrations rather than direct sales. The real selling is performed by partners, who manage site visits, in-person meetings, and other key activities. If assigned a less favorable territory, you may find it challenging to achieve your targets. Partners exert significant control over deals, and your role often involves merely checking in on deal status and providing updated quotes. Yes you are traveling to these territories as well its all paid for by the company, but most of the visits you are either kissing partners butts with lunch and dinners or begging customers for purchase orders. Thats what you 6 hour plane ride consists of, very degrading.\n\nWhile you can arrange meetings between partners and customers, your role is largely intermediary. Success in this position can be heavily influenced by territory and luck, as previous reps may have already exhausted key contacts. Meeting sales quotas often relies on renewals or deals brought in by partners rather than your own efforts. It’s also challenging to prospect new business due to prior outreach by other representatives. They don't explain this to you during interviews (but why would they, you probably wouldn't take the position) so the turnover rate is very high. People will not return to work. One day you'll see Fred or Sarah and then days and weeks will go by and you will never see them again. You will have to learn from other employees that Fred or Sarah was either fired for \"unknown\" reasons or they quit.\n\nIn some cases, individuals may achieve their quotas with minimal effort if they receive high-value deals from partners. Recognition is often given to those who benefit from such opportunities, even if their contribution to securing the deal was limited. The emphasis in this role is more on managing communications and relationships with partners rather than driving direct sales outcomes.\n\nIf you are on the cooperate side of the company, your quota first qtr can be as high as 100k-125k. Sled side is given a smaller quota, seeing as their deals take longer to come in, around 40k-60k. If you are looking to be promoted within these fields, they expect you to hit multiple times in a row on your quota, extremely unrealistic expectations.",

Some higher level people spoiled the EPMs for no reason, and one or two of these EPMs who was or is still on the team is the root cause of such toxic vibes. This includes, but is not limited to, talking behind someone's back and creating dramas. Another engineer left due to lack of supervision and mentoring, which is something you might expect when you join this company.

        "cons": "If you are seeking a role that allows you to fully utilize your sales skills, this position may not align with your goals. The role primarily involves facilitating camera demonstrations rather than direct sales. The real selling is performed by partners, who manage site visits, in-person meetings, and other key activities. If assigned a less favorable territory, you may find it challenging to achieve your targets. Partners exert significant control over deals, and your role often involves merely checking in on deal status and providing updated quotes. Yes you are traveling to these territories as well its all paid for by the company, but most of the visits you are either kissing partners butts with lunch and dinners or begging customers for purchase orders. Thats what you 6 hour plane ride consists of, very degrading.\n\nWhile you can arrange meetings between partners and customers, your role is largely intermediary. Success in this position can be heavily influenced by territory and luck, as previous reps may have already exhausted key contacts. Meeting sales quotas often relies on renewals or deals brought in by partners rather than your own efforts. It’s also challenging to prospect new business due to prior outreach by other representatives. They don't explain this to you during interviews (but why would they, you probably wouldn't take the position) so the turnover rate is very high. People will not return to work. One day you'll see Fred or Sarah and then days and weeks will go by and you will never see them again. You will have to learn from other employees that Fred or Sarah was either fired for \"unknown\" reasons or they quit.\n\nIn some cases, individuals may achieve their quotas with minimal effort if they receive high-value deals from partners. Recognition is often given to those who benefit from such opportunities, even if their contribution to securing the deal was limited. The emphasis in this role is more on managing communications and relationships with partners rather than driving direct sales outcomes.\n\nIf you are on the cooperate side of the company, your quota first qtr can be as high as 100k-125k. Sled side is given a smaller quota, seeing as their deals take longer to come in, around 40k-60k.

The company is focused solely on selling their product and making money, often at the expense of its people. Compensation is well below industry standards for most roles, and even long-term employees who meet or exceed expectations are rarely rewarded. Instead, they are often criticized or undermined.\n\nCommunication is a major issue here. There’s virtually no transparency when it comes to company-wide updates or information directly related to your role. Onboarding is minimal at best, especially for non-sales employees, leaving most people to figure things out on their own.\n\nThe management is poorly trained and often lacks the skills needed to lead effectively.

      "# [$2.95M Penalty and Permanent Injunction Resolves Lawsuit Against Verkada Inc. for Alleged Unlawful Commercial Emails, Data Security Failures and Deceptive Practices on 2024-09-04](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/295m-penalty-and-permanent-injunction-resolves-lawsuit-against-verkada-inc-alleged-unlawful)\nThe Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced today that Verkada Inc. (Verkada), a cloud-based security company headquartered in San Mateo, California, has agreed to a settlement requiring it to pay a $2.95 million civil penalty and implement extensive data security measures. This settlement resolves allegations that Verkada violated the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Act and engaged in unfair and deceptive practices in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act.\n\nIn a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the United States alleges that Verkada failed to implement reasonable security measures such as appropriate access management and data protection controls and adequate encryption of customer data. These failures allegedly exposed sensitive information — including security-camera footage of consumers visiting locations like hospitals and schools — to unauthorized access. The complaint additionally alleges that Verkada misrepresented the extent to which it used appropriate data security safeguards and complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). The complaint also alleges that Verkada sent numerous promotional emails that failed to clearly and conspicuously notify recipients of their opportunity to opt out of such messages and failed to include a valid physical postal address, and that Verkada did not honor requests to opt out from its promotional emails within ten business days of receiving those requests, all in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act.\n\nTo resolve the lawsuit, the parties agreed to a settlement reflected by the stipulated order issued today by the Court. The stipulated order requires Verkada to pay a $2.95 million civil penalty and to comply with the CAN-SPAM Act, including by honoring requests to opt out of its commercial emails. The stipulated order also prohibits Verkada from misrepresenting its data security practices and requires it to establish a comprehensive information security program and undergo regular third-party assessments of its data security practices.\n\n“This settlement underscores the importance of robust data security measures, especially for companies that are themselves in the security industry. Failure to protect sensitive information puts consumers at risk,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “We will continue to work with the FTC to hold companies accountable for such violations.”\n\n“When customers invite companies into private spaces to monitor consumers by using their security cameras and other products, they expect those companies to provide basic levels of security, which Verkada failed to do,” said Director Samuel Levin of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “Companies that fail to secure and protect consumer data can expect to be held responsible.”\n\nTrial Attorneys Cameron A. Brown and Amanda K. Kelly, Senior Trial Attorney James T. Nelson and Assistant Director Zachary A. Dietert of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Vivian Wang for the Northern District of California are handling the case, in coordination with staff from the FTC’s Division of Privacy and Identity Protection.",
      "# [FTC Penalizes Cloud-Based Physical Security Company for Data Security and CAN-SPAM Violations by Kirk J. Nahra, Ali A. Jessani, Sarah Litwin on 2024-09-30](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/blogs/wilmerhale-privacy-and-cybersecurity-law/20240930-ftc-penalizes-cloudbased-physical-security-company-for-data-security-and-canspam-violations)\nOn August 30, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) entered into a proposed settlement order with cloud-based physical security solutions provider, Verkada Inc. (“Verkada”), settling allegations of data security violations and mandating a record monetary payment (of $2.95 million) to remedy separate allegations of unlawful email marketing practices in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act. The agency’s case against Verkada stemmed from the business’s alleged failure to use appropriate information security practices, which the agency claimed allowed a hacker to access customers’ security cameras and sensitive personal information about consumers, as a result. This action also alleged that Verkada misrepresented its security practices, as well as its compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) rules and with Privacy Shield.\n\nThis settlement is notable for a few reasons. First, it shows that – while the FTC is focused on creating new substantive security and privacy obligations for entities through its ability to enforce “unfair” violations under Section 5 of the FTC Act – it is still looking to enforce the older privacy laws that fall within its jurisdiction (such as CAN-SPAM). The FTC is also actively looking to bring enforcement actions against companies where an alleged privacy or security violation leads to the potential compromise of sensitive data. Finally, the agency still cares about the representations company’s make about their security compliance, especially if those representations relate to compliance with a formal security program (such as the security requirements mandated by HIPAA). It is also notable for companies that the FTC is continuing to enforce historic compliance efforts with Privacy Shield, even though the program has been replaced by the Data Privacy Framework.\n\nIn this article, we summarize the agency’s complaint and order against Verkada and identify key takeaways from the decision. To stay up to date on the latest state privacy law developments, please subscribe to the WilmerHale Privacy and Cybersecurity Law Blog.\n\nI.Summary of the Complaint\n\nVerkada is a developer of physical security solutions that include video security cameras, door locks, and panic buttons, among other products, as well as a cloud-based software platform to manage them. The company sells these solutions to over 26,000 organizations today, including office buildings, warehouses, retail stores, healthcare facilities, and schools. Some of Verkada’s customers deploy the products in sensitive areas that implicate privacy concerns (such as schools and psychiatric hospitals).\n\nIn its complaint, the FTC alleged Verkada engaged in (i) multiple data security practices and failures that resulted in repeated risk of consumer data exposure and led to cybersecurity intrusions. The agency also charged Verkada with engaging in other deceptive and unfair practices including (ii) misrepresenting its security practices to consumers, (iii) misrepresenting alleged HIPAA certification and Privacy Shield compliance, (iv) failing to disclose the association or employment relationship of certain individuals who posted positive ratings and reviews about Verkada and its products online, and (v) failing to include provide consumers with an option to unsubscribe or opt-out, honor opt-out requests, and provide a physical postal address in emails.\n\nThe FTC explained the following was considered to be an unfair or deceptive practices in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act:\n\nFailure to Safeguard Personal Information\n\nThe FTC asserted that Verkada failed to safeguard customers’ and consumers’ personal information collected through the company’s security cameras. Specifically, the agency claimed that Verkada failed to impose reasonable access management controls including strong password authentication, role-based access controls, and issue alerts for activities such as incorrect logins to administrative accounts or removal of privileges for accounts. In addition, according to the complaint, the company failed to establish data loss protection or perform data discovery and categorization for all sensitive personal information or regular assessments to determine the effectiveness of protection measures. Verkada also allegedly had no centralized logging and alerting capabilities, nor did it conduct regular risk assessments, vulnerability scans, or penetration testing of its networks and databases. Lastly, the FTC’s complaint asserted that the company failed to assess or enforce compliance of its written information security standards and policies. According to the FTC, these combined failures allowed an unauthorized actor to hack into Verkada’s platform in March 2021, gaining access to security camera footage a limited number of customers.\n\nThe agency sought redress for what it claimed was a substantial injury to consumers in the form of exposure of their personal information and by the invasion of their privacy, especially for those in sensitive settings such as hospital rooms and schools.\n\nSecurity Misrepresentations\n\nThe agency scrutinized Verkada’s representations about its information security practices and considered them to be false and misleading. In a 2018 press release, Verkada reassured customers of the strength of its security products, stating “Verkada offers a range of benefits, including stronger data security…” The complaint also referenced the company’s webpage, which made numerous claims regarding information security practices.\n\nAccording to the FTC, Verkada made multiple misleading statements such as “Verkada devices are compliant against some of the strictest data handling and security standards in the world” and Verkada was “[f]ully HIPAA compliant” (when, in fact, Verkada’s products were not).\n\nThe FTC’s complaint also found issues with Verkada’s representation that it was Privacy Shield certified. Though no longer in effect as a valid data transfer mechanism for personal data from the EU to the US, companies that were previously registered under Privacy Shield are still responsible for the promises they made at the time related to their certification. In this case, the FTC was focused on this specific Privacy Shield principle:\n\n“SECURITY [Principle 4]: (a) Organizations creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating personal information must take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect it from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal data.”\n\nThe agency contended that Verkada made multiple false statements, including written statements that Verkada achieved the Privacy Shield certification on its web page as of December 2022.\n\nFalse and Misleading Online Reviews\n\nAccording to the complaint, individuals associated with Verkada wrote online reviews on the company’s Google Maps profile without disclosing their relationship to the company. The agency claimed that Verkada was aware of these reviews and that they omitted the reviewers’ ties to the company (including a venture capital investor of Verkada). The FTC’s complaint further asserted that Verkada had encouraged some employees to post these reviews.\n\nCAN-SPAM Violations\n\nThe complaint further alleges that Verkada failed to honor opt-out requests, provide notice of opt-out requests or a valid physical postal address in its email marketing communications. At issue is that Verkada’s email marketing campaigns failed to abide by the CAN-SPAM Act, a 2004 law protecting consumers from unfair email marketing tactics. The CAN-SPAM Act also makes it illegal to initiate email marketing without a clear and conspicuous opt-out. The law forces companies to honor opt-out requests within 10-business days after receipt of such a request, which Verkada allegedly failed to do.\n\nII.Stipulated Order\n\nUnder the stipulated order, Verkada was required to pay a $2.95 million monetary fine for the alleged CAN-SPAM violations, the highest monetary penalty ever for a CAN-SPAM violation. Verkada also agreed to the following terms in the order:\n\nPermanent Injunction of Data Security Practices\n\nA prohibition against misrepresentations concerning privacy, security, confidentiality of consumer data, compliance programs including HIPAA compliance, independence of endorser or reviewers of a business product or service.\n\nA Requirement to Implement a Comprehensive Privacy Program\n\nFollowing the trend in other recent FTC orders, Verkada is required to develop and implement a comprehensive information security program with biennial third-party oversight for 20 years. To safeguard personal information and customer information, the program must be documented in writing, provided to the board of directors or equivalent governing body, and overseen by a designated qualified employee. Independent third-party assessors will annually review the program’s effectiveness. Furthermore, material program evaluations or updates are required within 30 days of a covered incident. A covered incident occurs when information of or about an individual consumer was, or is reasonably believed to have been, accessed, acquired, or publicly exposed without authorization. After a covered incident, Verkada will submit a report to the Federal Trade Commission within 10 days.\n\nThe order also requires all employees to complete annual mandatory training on how to safeguard personal information and customer information. Verkada will be required to implement controls monitoring its networks to identify and respond to anomalous activity and unauthorized attempts to access or exfiltrate personal information and customer data. Verkada has agreed to provide the agency with annual updates of its satisfaction with the order requirements for 20 years.\n\nEnjoined from Unlawful Commercial Email Practices\n\nFinally, the order prohibits Verkada from violating Section 5 of the CAN-SPAM Act, or otherwise not complying with the requirements to provide a physical post address, provide a notice for consumers to decline to receive email messages, and honor email opt-out requests in connection with email marketing or advertising.\n\nIII.Key Takeaways\n\n1. The FTC continues to enforce data security violations.\n\nWhile many of the FTC’s recent enforcement actions have focused on “privacy” violations (e.g., the disclosure of sensitive data to third parties for advertising purposes), this decision shows that the FTC isn’t turning a blind eye to security violations, especially if the inadequate security leads to a data breach. Companies should pay attention to recent FTC settlement orders regarding data security and assess whether their practices live up to the FTC’s expectations, as well as to the promises they are making to consumers about their security. This latter point is especially important if a company is claiming to adhere to a specific security standard, such as the HIPAA Security Rule.\n\n2. The FTC will continue to focus its enforcement actions where a company’s data practices potentially lead to the compromise of sensitive data.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the FTC targeted a company that provides products with access to personal information from privacy-sensitive facilities, such as psychiatric hospitals and women’s health clinics. Through this order, the FTC adds insight into what the agency considers to be sensitive information that merits heightened protection. According to the agreed to information security program requirements, the appropriate level of data protection should be based on “the volume and sensitivity of the data at risk.” In this case, the FTC contends allowing a hacker to access internet-connected security cameras and view patients in psychiatric hospitals and women’s health clinics evidenced a failure to safeguard particularly sensitive information.\n\n3. CAN-SPAM still matters.\n\nThis is the FTC’s third CAN-SPAM related enforcement action or lawsuit in the last two years. While the agency hasn’t historically focused its attention on the law, this recent trend may indicate that this is becoming an area of focus for the agency. Companies should closely review their email marketing practices in light of these actions.\n\n4. Privacy Shield also (still) matters.\n\nPrivacy Shield being replaced by the Data Privacy Framework isn’t stopping the FTC from enforcing the historical promises companies made under the old data transfer framework. Companies should keep this in mind as a potential enforcement risk.",
      "# [Security cameras, CAN-SPAM, and “reasonable or appropriate security” by David Kessler (US), Susan Ross (US) on 2024-09-09](https://www.dataprotectionreport.com/2024/09/security-cameras-can-spam-and-reasonable-or-appropriate-security/)\nOn August 30, 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a proposed settlement with security camera manufacturer Verkada Inc., claiming Verkada committed a variety of unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and CAN-SPAM in connection with a security breach. (The U.S. Department of Justice filed that complaint and proposed stipulated joint order on behalf of the FTC.) Verkada does not admit or deny the claims (Order, para. 4).\n\nBackground\n\nAccording to the complaint, Verkada developed and sold security cameras and other surveillance products to businesses, including schools and medical facilities. Between 2019 and 2021, Verkada sold over 240,000 cameras, which were linked to Verkada’s platform, which enabled customers to have remote access to the cameras and stored surveillance footage. Verkada collected metadata about the security camera usage (including IP addresses and locations) as well as customer names, addresses, usernames and passwords, site floorplans, names of organizational contacts and Wi-Fi credentials.\n\nThe video cameras collected images of individuals, including patients and schoolchildren, as well as sensitive personal information (including medical records). The complaint states that Verkada offered its customers “People Analytics,” which allowed customers to search through video images collected for gender, clothing color, and/or to use facial recognition.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Verkada’s website made several claims about its security practices, including claims that it was HIPAA certified and compliant with the EU-US Privacy Shield. The complaint alleges the Verkada sent out large numbers of commercial emails, but did not include functional opt-out features, and also did not honor opt-outs it did receive. The complaint also claims that Verkada also did not include a clear and conspicuous opportunity to opt-out in emails and did not consistently include a physical postal address.\n\nParagraph 20 of the complaint asserts that Verkada did not take reasonable measures to secure the customer and consumer data, listing “Defendant’s information security failures” as follows:\n\na. Impose reasonable access management controls such as:\n\ni. requiring unique and complex passwords (i.e., long passwords not used by the individual for any other online service);\n\nii. enforcing role-based access controls to safeguard personal information, such as implementing the principle of least privilege and requiring multi-factor authentication for account access across all of Defendant’s systems;\n\niii. issuing alerts for activities, such as unsuccessful logins to administrative accounts and the addition or removal of any account with administrative privileges;\n\nb. Prevent data loss by establishing data protection controls, such as:\n\ni. performing data discovery and categorization for all sensitive personal information to ensure it is appropriately protected during transmission and storage;\n\nii. implementing a data loss prevention solution that monitors for suspicious activities such as unauthorized data access and exfiltration; and\n\niii. performing regular assessments to determine the effectiveness of protection measures;\n\nc. Implement centralized logging and alerting capabilities;\n\nd. Develop adequate security vulnerability management standards, policies, procedures, and practices such as:\n\ni. testing, auditing, assessing, or reviewing its products, or applications; security features; and\n\nii. conducting regular risk assessments, vulnerability scans, and penetration testing of its networks and databases;\n\ne. Implement secure network controls, such as disabling unnecessary ports, protocols, and services, and properly configuring firewall settings;\n\nf. Adequately encrypt customer’s data in transit or at rest; and\n\ng. Develop adequate written information security standards, policies, procedures, and practices; assess or enforce compliance with the written standards, policies, procedures, and practices that it did have; and implement training for employees (including engineers) regarding such standards, policies, procedures and practices.\n\nParagraph 3 of the complaint states that these “failures allowed a threat actor to access Defendant’s customer support accounts, view customer cameras, and access personal information relating to customers and consumers.”\n\nThe complaint included two counts of unfair information security practices in violation of § 5 of the FTC Act (one count for consumers and one for business customers); and five counts of deception in violation of § 5 (two counts of information security misrepresentations; one for HIPAA compliance misrepresentations; one for Privacy Shield misrepresentations; and two counts related to failure to disclose some online reviews were from individuals with “material connections” to Verkada and thus were not “impartial”). The complaint also included 3 counts relating to CAN-SPAM (failure to honor opt-outs; failure to provide notice of opt-out opportunity; and failure to provide physical postal address). CAN-SPAM includes civil penalties, and these formed the basis of the $2.95 million proposed settlement.\n\nThe proposed order contains many provisions similar to previous FTC settlements, but there are a few items that are particularly noteworthy:\n\n“Customer Information” [note this is not “consumer” information] includes not only user account credentials and email addresses, but also site floorplans, names and titles of customer contacts, Wi-Fi credentials; metadata about product usage and “access control elements, including access levels, access groups, and badge numbers.”\n\n“Personal information” includes not only names, addresses, and birthdates, but also live camera footage, video archives, still images or photos, and audio recordings.\n\nThe proposed order would last for 20 years and prohibits misrepresentations and violations of CAN-SPAM, and it would require that company implement an information security program (including someone responsible for overseeing it as well as multi-factor authentication), and third-party assessments. The proposed order contains an interesting prohibition on the third party assessor: “No finding of any Assessment shall rely primarily on assertions or attestations by Defendant’s management.”\n\nOur Take\n\nThere seems to be a trend developing among regulators, outlining the elements of “reasonable security.” This proposed judgment marks the third within two months that focuses on what is (or is not) “reasonable security.” The first settlement involved the New York Attorney General’s interpretation of New York’s SHIELD Act (see our write-up here); the second consent involved the California Attorney General’s requirements (involving Blackbaud, here); and this one is from the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nYet these three regulators, acting under very different laws, found that “reasonable security” includes all of the following elements, which certainly are not sufficient to demonstrate “reasonable security,” but all of which these regulators found to be necessary:\n\nDesignation of an individual in charge of the information security program\n\nEncryption of personal data,\n\nIntrusion detection and prevention;\n\nMulti-factor authentication,\n\nPassword management, and\n\nSegmentation/limiting access.\n\nAnd each proposed settlement included a multi-million-dollar payment.\n\nImportantly, here the FTC did not just focus on personal information of consumers, but confidential business information of Verkada’s customers. This expansion is a significant addition as breach notification laws focus entirely on personal information and, absent contract or affirmative representations, a victim of a security incident is not obligated to notify another business of the loss of their business information.",
      "# [Privacy Perils Series: Verkada Case on 2024-09-19](https://www.schwabe.com/publication/privacy-perils-what-went-wrong/)\nThe FTC’s recent enforcement action against a B2B company is a cautionary tale about ‎common, easy-to-avoid privacy, security, and marketing missteps; and a reminder that fines ‎aren’t the only consequences to fear in an enforcement action.‎\n\nIn addition to paying a $3M fine, for the next 20 years the FTC will require Verkada, Inc. to implement a comprehensive information security program, submit to third-party information security assessments, and comply with other robust administrative requirements to settle allegations that the company’s privacy, security, and marketing practices violated the law. To implement these obligations will require significant resources and investments. In the complaint filed by the Department of Justice at the FTC’s request, Verkada is alleged to have engaged in many unfair or deceptive business practices. Here are the top five, many of which are all too common:\n\nFailing to Adequately Protect Data. The complaint alleges that Verkada failed to provide reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect the personal information it collected and maintained, and that allowed a hacker to gain access to information from more than 150,000 live security cameras—including some in sensitive locations, such as psychiatric hospitals, women’s health clinics, children’s bedrooms, and prison cells. According to the complaint, reasonable and appropriate measures should have included:\n\nAccess management basics, such as the use of unique and complex passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication\n\nLogin monitoring to flag suspicious activities, such as unsuccessful logins to administrative accounts, and the addition or removal of any account with administrative privileges\n\nRegular risk assessments, vulnerability scans, and penetration testing\n\nTesting, auditing, and review of the effectiveness of security measures and services\n\nUse of encryption at rest and in transit, as well as network controls, such as properly configured firewalls\n\nDevelopment of adequate written information security standards, policies, procedures, and practices; and adequate training of employees on same\n\nMaking Misleading Statements about Data Protection Investments and Commitment. Verkada is alleged to have misrepresented its security practices in numerous ways. ‎First, their privacy policy claimed: “[W]e take customer privacy seriously” and “use best-in-class data security tools and best practices to keep your data safe.” Second, the company’s website purportedly contained misleading statements such as, “[f]rom Day 1, we’ve made technology decisions that strengthen security and … Verkada uses commercially reasonable efforts to deploy and uphold [] security best practices and standards….” Finally, in blog posts, press releases, and interviews, Verkada assured customers of the quality of its security practices and commitment to data protection. The complaint specifically references the following quote from Verkada’s CEO: “We built a system that’s end-to-end secure. That’s a huge problem with today’s systems. Verkada is secure out of the box.”\n\nMisrepresenting Privacy and Security Compliance. When Verkada marketed, promoted, advertised, and sold its products and services, the FTC claims the company frequently misrepresented it was (1) HIPAA-certified or compliant and (2) that it adhered to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield principles.\n\nSending Incessant Marketing Emails That Lacked Compliance Elements and Ignoring Customer Complaints. Verkada is alleged to have sent over 30 million promotional emails without an effective unsubscribe mechanism, and without including a valid, physical postal address in the body of the message. Email recipients repeatedly notified Verkada they didn’t want the emails, and they were unable to unsubscribe, despite multiple attempts.\n\nPosting Fake Reviews. Verkada employees and an investor purportedly violated FTC rules by posting positive online ratings and reviews without disclosing their relationship to the company or employee status, an activity which was at times encouraged. The complaint alleged that in June 2023, 35% of Google Maps ratings and reviews for Verkada were attributable to this practice, which FTC deems unlawful business.\n\nWhat are some better practices?\n\nImplement adequate security measures that take into account the types of information you process. Such measures should include technical, physical, and organizational controls designed to prevent unauthorized access to, use of, loss of, or alterations to information you process about consumers and businesses.\n\nTake stock of your data. Take inventory of the categories of personal information your company collects to ensure the information is processed lawfully. That may include analyzing many issues, such as whether personal information is being used for the purpose it was collected? Is it secured adequately, and what is the potential harm if it were disclosed improperly? How do data retention and deletion processes align with requirements and business needs?\n\nKnow Your Requirements. Ensure you understand your privacy and security obligations by identifying the laws and regulations that apply to your business, and revisit your assessments regularly, because data protection laws are proliferating.\n\nEnact policies and procedures that support your compliance needs. These could include conducting routine risk assessments and security testing, holding regular training for employees, and adopting written data practices and standards. It is common practice now to have a team and policy in place to respond to data privacy requests.\n\nBe aware of marketing pitfalls. CAN-SPAM was not on our 2024 Privacy Enforcement Bingo Card! While CAN-SPAM regulate many aspects of marketing, this enforcement action also serves as a great reminder of the many local, state, federal, and international laws that govern promotional communications (including texts and phone calls), digital advertising campaigns, and other common activities aimed to create brand awareness, generate leads, and increase demand.\n\nCommunicate Marketing Guardrails. If innovative marketing campaigns are key to your success, consider developing a marketing playbook or policy. This internal document is intended to clearly describe a company’s compliance obligations, outline prohibited activities, and establish processes and procedures to ensure the company is responsive to new rules, complaints, opt-out requests, customer concerns, and more. To provide a place to start, the FTC recently issued a final rule that addresses reviews and testimonials, and the FTC endorsement guides outline disclosure requirements in advertising.\n\nHave a Top-Notch Privacy Statement. Transparency can be an excellent risk mitigation strategy. Plus, companies often find that updating their privacy statement can expose significant risks. Those benefits are lost if the privacy statement contains privacy platitudes similar to those highlighted in the Verkada complaint. Many companies make a point to update their privacy statement at least annually to ensure that they are up to date.\n\nThe case is available here.\n\nThis article summarizes aspects of the law and does not constitute legal advice.

      "# [Consumer Groups Request FTC Action on Software Issues for Connected Devices](https://www.klgates.com/Consumer-Groups-Request-FTC-Action-on-Software-Issues-for-Connected-Devices-10-11-2024)\nA recent open letter sent to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) jointly by consumer advocacy groups, including Consumer Reports, US PIRG and fifteen other entities, may be an early signal of future FTC focus.1 The letter addresses software issues for connected devices or any other tangible products, whether embedded or separately accessed. More specifically, the letter urges the FTC to address three practices that allegedly hinder consumer’s expected use of the connected device: (1) placing software behind an additional or later subscription pay wall; (2) deprecating or failing to update software, effectively “bricking” the product; and (3) preventing software access from moving to a second-hand buyer.\n\nHow Have These Issues Been Addressed Historically?\n\nThe FTC has publicly investigated the issue of software deprecation for a connected device under its Section 5 powers in at least one instance in 2016, but declined to take enforcement action.2 Simultaneously with this 2016 closing letter, the FTC issued a blog post titled, What happens when the sun sets on a smart product?, which set out these specific issues for companies to consider when launching a connected device:\n\nWould consumers regard the brand’s offering as primarily a device or software?\n\nAre consumers getting a fixed-term rental or subscription, or are they getting something they will own and can rely on for the life of the device?\n\nWould reasonable consumers expect to be able to keep using the device – and have it be fully functional – even if the brand “rides off into the sunset”?\n\nWould consumers expect the device to have an “expiration date”?\n\nCould consumers keep using the device in the ways they would reasonably expect based on their experience with similar devices?\n\nWhat representations did the brand make to consumers – or what would consumers otherwise expect – about the time period for which security would be provided?\n\nThe FTC did not provide answers or any further discussion of these six points. The FTC did raise the related point that failure to maintain technical support and security updates could leave consumer devices more vulnerable to attack, an issue at the forefront of the FTC’s recent proposed settlement against Verkada, Inc. in connection with security failures and misrepresentations for its connected security cameras.3 Privacy and security concerns, specifically, have been the focus of prior FTC comments, including the subject of FTC comments to the Department of Commerce identifying concerns of Internet of Things products in 2016.4\n\nThe recent open letter mirrored many of the issues identified in 2016, providing specific recommendations around required disclosures of guaranteed minimum support, obligations related to maintaining unaffected core functionalities and protection of “adversarial interoperability” for products with inoperable original software.\n\nHow Does This Impact My Company?\n\nWhile neither this open letter nor any specific FTC guidance currently requires any specific action,5 the open letter and past FTC commentary does suggest that this may be an area in which the FTC may initiate rulemaking, an inquiry, administrative proceeding, or court action.\n\nWhat Should I Do Now?\n\nIt’s an opportune moment to review the breadth of current advertising claims and warranty commitments across relevant products, as well as other documentation and marketing materials to identify any commitments as to continued software use, access and updates.\n\nWhat if the FTC Contacts Me?\n\nIf you receive a confidential inquiry letter or other communication from the FTC, consumer groups, or individual consumers, we can advise you as to next steps, including any potential response.\n\n1 Open letter dated Sept. 5, 2024, available at https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/FTCLetter9.5.2024.pdf.\n\n2 See Closing letter to Richard J. Lutton, Jr., Head of Legal and Regulatory Affairs, Nest Labs, Inc. FTC File No. 162-3119 (Jul. 7, 2016) available at https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/closing_letters/nid/160707nestrevolvletter.pdf (“The FTC staff was concerned that reasonable consumers would not expect the Revolv hubs to become unusable due to Revolv Inc.'s actions, and that unilaterally rendering the devices inoperable would cause unjustified, substantial consumer injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably avoid.”).\n\n3 US v.

      "# [Verkada Settles Major Lawsuit with $2.95 Million Penalty and New Data Security Requirements by Tejaswini Deshmukh on 2024-09-05](https://regtechtimes.com/verkada-settles-major-lawsuit-with-2-95-m-penalty/)\nIn a major legal breakthrough, Verkada Inc., a cloud-based security firm headquartered in San Mateo, California, has reached a settlement with the U.S. DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which involves a $2.95 million civil penalty. This settlement addresses serious allegations related to data security, deceptive practices, and email marketing violations, marking a pivotal moment for Verkada and setting a precedent for similar companies.\n\nSettlement Overview\n\nThe settlement, formalized through a stipulated order issued by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, resolves several critical allegations against Verkada. The company has been accused of failing to uphold adequate security measures, sending unlawful commercial emails, and misrepresenting its data security practices.\n\nData Security Failures at Verkada\n\nThe lawsuit centered on allegations that Verkada did not implement adequate security measures to safeguard customer data. The complaint alleges that Verkada’s lapses included inadequate access management controls, insufficient data protection measures, and a lack of encryption for sensitive information. These failures reportedly led to unauthorized access to security camera footage, which included recordings from sensitive locations like hospitals and schools.\n\nThe complaint also accused the company of not complying with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which mandates strict data protection guidelines. This breach of trust is especially concerning given Verkada’s role in the security industry, where high standards of data protection are expected.\n\nChina Alerts Citizens to Dangerous Wind Measurement Towers as Vehicles of Espionage and Data Theft\n\nViolations of the CAN-SPAM Act\n\nAlongside data security concerns, Verkada was also accused of breaching the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Act. This federal law regulates commercial email practices, requiring clear opt-out options and the inclusion of a valid physical postal address. According to the complaint, the company’s promotional emails did not meet these requirements. Specifically, Verkada was accused of failing to provide clear opt-out mechanisms and not honoring opt-out requests within the required ten business days.\n\nDeceptive Practices by Verkada\n\nThe settlement also addresses claims that Verkada engaged in deceptive practices by misrepresenting its data security measures. The company allegedly overstated its compliance with data protection standards and HIPAA regulations, misleading consumers about the safety of their data.\n\nTerms of the Settlement\n\nAs part of the settlement, Verkada is required to pay the $2.95 million penalty and implement several corrective measures. These include:\n\nCAN-SPAM Act Compliance: The company must adhere to all provisions of the CAN-SPAM Act, including providing clear opt-out options in commercial emails and including a valid physical postal address.\n\nEnhanced Data Security Measures: The company is required to establish a comprehensive information security program. This program must address the deficiencies identified in the lawsuit and include robust data protection measures.\n\nRegular Third-Party Assessments: The company will undergo regular assessments by independent third parties to ensure compliance with its data security obligations and to verify the effectiveness of its information security program.\n\nRegulatory Response\n\nThe settlement reflects a significant enforcement action by federal authorities aimed at improving data security and protecting consumer rights. Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division, stressed the importance of strong data protection measures, particularly for companies like Verkada that operate in the security sector. “A failure to protect sensitive information puts consumers at risk,” he stated.\n\nFTC Director Samuel Levin of the Bureau of Consumer Protection also emphasized that companies like Verkada must uphold high security standards. “Companies that fail to secure and protect consumer data can expect to be held responsible,” Levin said.\n\nIndustry Implications\n\nThe Verkada settlement serves as a critical reminder for other companies in the data security and marketing sectors. It highlights the importance of maintaining rigorous data protection standards and adhering to legal requirements for commercial communications. With increasing regulatory scrutiny, companies must prioritize robust security measures and transparent practices to avoid legal repercussions and maintain consumer trust.\n\nThe settlement with Verkada Inc. represents a significant legal and financial consequence for failing to meet data security and marketing standards. It highlights the commitment of regulatory bodies to enforce consumer protection laws and hold companies accountable for safeguarding sensitive information.",

The settlement requires Verkada to pay a civil penalty of $2.95 million and implement extensive data security measures, including the establishment of a comprehensive information security program and regular third-party assessments [(Justice Department, 2024)](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/295m-penalty-and-permanent-injunction-resolves-lawsuit-against-verkada-inc-alleged-unlawful) [(WilmerHale, 2024)](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/blogs/wilmerhale-privacy-and-cybersecurity-law/20240930-ftc-penalizes-cloudbased-physical-security-company-for-data-security-and-canspam-violations).\n\n## Financial Overview\n\nVerkada has successfully raised a total of $457 million in funding, with its latest Series D round occurring in October 2023, where it secured $100 million [(Tracxn, 2021)](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/verkada/__MabJwkKkg0oIExy7Z4aEaDyJpDpGhLgk1mfJDk_rdQA). The company’s valuation has seen significant growth, reaching $3.2 billion in 2022, reflecting strong investor confidence and market demand for its security solutions [(Tracxn, 2021)](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/verkada/__MabJwkKkg0oIExy7Z4aEaDyJpDpGhLgk1mfJDk_rdQA).\n\n## Product Quality and Market Position\n\nVerkada's product line is designed for simplicity and scalability, providing organizations with real-time insights to enhance safety and operational efficiency. The company claims that its systems require minimal cabling and no open ports, which simplifies installation and maintenance [(Verkada, 2024)](https://www.verkada.com/newsroom/). However, the recent FTC settlement highlights significant concerns regarding the adequacy of Verkada's data security measures, which allegedly allowed unauthorized access to sensitive information, including security footage from hospitals and schools [(Justice Department, 2024)](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/295m-penalty-and-permanent-injunction-resolves-lawsuit-against-verkada-inc-alleged-unlawful).\n\n### Customer Base and Market Reach\n\nVerkada has established a diverse customer base, serving over 26,000 organizations, including 82 of the Fortune 500 companies [(Verkada, 2024)](https://www.verkada.com/newsroom/). The company’s products are deployed in various sensitive environments, raising the stakes for maintaining robust data security practices.\n\n## Executive Insights\n\nFilip Kaliszan, the CEO of Verkada, has emphasized the company's commitment to security, stating, “We built a system that’s end-to-end secure. That’s a huge problem with today’s systems. Verkada is secure out of the box” [(Schwabe, 2024)](https://www.schwabe.com/publication/privacy-perils-what-went-wrong/). However, the recent FTC findings challenge this assertion, indicating a gap between the company's claims and its actual security practices.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVerkada Inc. stands as a significant player in the cloud-based security market, with a robust product offering and a growing customer base. However, the recent regulatory challenges and the need for improved data security measures present critical areas for the company to address moving forward. Prospective candidates and investors should consider both the growth potential and the risks associated with Verkada's current operational and regulatory landscape. \n\nFor further details, please refer to the sources cited throughout this report."
