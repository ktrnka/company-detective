  "summary_markdown": "# About Nordstrom\n\nNordstrom, Inc. is a prominent American luxury department store chain headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The company was founded in 1901 by John W. Nordstrom and Carl F. Wallin, initially as a shoe store. Over the years, Nordstrom has evolved into a full-line retailer, offering a wide range of clothing, accessories, and home goods. As of October 2023, Nordstrom operates approximately 360 stores across the United States, including its off-price division, Nordstrom Rack [(Wikipedia, 2003-04-22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom).\n\nNordstrom primarily operates in the B2C sector, serving a diverse clientele with its luxury and contemporary fashion, beauty products, and home goods. The company is renowned for its exceptional customer service and hosts an annual Anniversary Sale, which is a significant event drawing considerable customer engagement [(Hollywood Reporter, 2024-08-01)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/shopping/nordstrom-anniversary-sale-date-early-access-deals-1234975177/).\n\nIn terms of financial performance, Nordstrom reported net earnings of $122 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, with a 3.4% increase in net sales compared to the same period in fiscal 2023. The off-price division, Nordstrom Rack, saw an 8.8% increase in net sales, indicating strong performance [(PR Newswire, 2024-08-27)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nordstrom-reports-second-quarter-2024-earnings-302232005.html).\n\nNordstrom has also been focusing on expanding its digital presence. In April 2024, the company launched a new digital marketplace to enhance its online product assortment, which is part of a broader strategy to boost digital sales [(WWD, 2024-04-29)](https://wwd.com/business-news/retail/nordstrom-launches-online-marketplace-offerings-of-brands-sizes-and-prices-to-grow-1236337054/).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Erik Nordstrom**: CEO of Nordstrom, Inc. Erik is a fourth-generation member of the Nordstrom family and has played a crucial role in navigating the company through recent challenges, including the expansion of the Nordstrom Rack division and the launch of the digital marketplace [(Retail Dive, 2024-04-19)](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstrom-family-may-try-again-to-take-the-company-private/713679/).\n\n- **Pete Nordstrom**: President and Chief Brand Officer. Like Erik, Pete is also a fourth-generation Nordstrom family member and has been instrumental in the company's strategic initiatives [(Retail Dive, 2024-04-19)](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstrom-family-may-try-again-to-take-the-company-private/713679/).\n\n# News\n\n## Financial Performance\n\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2024, Nordstrom reported net earnings of $122 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, with a 3.4% increase in net sales compared to the same period in fiscal 2023. Nordstrom Rack, the company's off-price division, saw an 8.8% increase in net sales, highlighting its strong performance [(PR Newswire, 2024-08-27)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nordstrom-reports-second-quarter-2024-earnings-302232005.html).\n\n## Digital Marketplace Launch\n\nIn April 2024, Nordstrom launched a new digital marketplace aimed at expanding its online product assortment. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to enhance digital sales, which accounted for 36% of total sales in the previous year. The marketplace is expected to increase the number of brands available on Nordstrom's website while maintaining a curated shopping experience [(WWD, 2024-04-29)](https://wwd.com/business-news/retail/nordstrom-launches-online-marketplace-offerings-of-brands-sizes-and-prices-to-grow-1236337054/).\n\n## Acquisition Interest\n\nThe Nordstrom family, which owns approximately 33.4% of the company's outstanding shares, has expressed interest in taking the company private, offering $23 per share in a bid supported by the Mexican retail group El Puerto de Liverpool. This proposal comes amid ongoing challenges in the retail sector and aims to provide the family with more control over the company's operations [(AP News, 2024-09-04)](https://apnews.com/article/nordstrom-takeover-liverpool-6d3a0514cb7920af32162edbb59fc201).\n\n## Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions\n\nIn 2011, Nordstrom acquired HauteLook, an online retailer specializing in flash sales, for $180 million. This acquisition has helped bolster Nordstrom's online presence and customer engagement [(Wikipedia, 2003-04-22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom). Additionally, the company has formed partnerships with various brands to enhance its product offerings, including a recent agreement with 11 Honor√© to sell plus-sized designer fashion [(PR Newswire, 2024-03-05)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nordstrom-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-earnings-302080324.html).\n\n## Challenges and Market Position\n\nDespite its strong brand identity and customer loyalty, Nordstrom faces challenges common in the retail sector, including competition from off-price retailers like TJX Companies and Ross Stores. The company's decision to exit the Canadian market in 2023 and close several underperforming stores reflects ongoing efforts to streamline operations and focus on profitable segments [(Wikipedia, 2003-04-22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nNordstrom, Inc. continues to adapt to the evolving retail landscape by expanding its digital presence and focusing on its off-price division, Nordstrom Rack. The recent interest from the Nordstrom family to take the company private may provide the necessary flexibility to navigate current market challenges. As the company moves forward, its ability to enhance customer experience and maintain a curated product assortment will be critical to its success.",

Also as the other person said the lines are pretty long (mine only took me about 15 minutes to get through but it was still the longest I've ever seen there, but I went at like 3pm so maybe that helped?).\n\nSo I'd say if you have some time to kill and want to buy some items from a brand where you already know how it fits you then I'd say go for it, but otherwise I'd say skip it.\n\n### Comment ID fva2lti with +2 score by [(schrutefarms-, Reddit, 2020-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/hbnjud/is_it_worth_checking_out_the_in_store_nordstrom/fva2lti/) (in reply to ID fv9xeu6):\nOh I didn‚Äôt know it was final sale :/ \nI‚Äôm going to check it out.

But the sale is absolutely insane. I got Birkenstocks for $18, some $20 Nikes, and a bunch of amazing exercise gear for $10 apiece. 40% off *everything* is really a ridiculous steal.

Everything is on clearance plus an optional 40% off. If you opt out of the 40% off things are refundable, if you chose to go for the extra 40% off, it‚Äôs final sale. The one downside is that fitting rooms are closed so you kind of have to know your size if you want to get the 40% off due to final sale. The first day I waited in line for about two hours. It sucked. I did end up going back the next day with my brother so he could buy some clothes, probably waited about an hour this time. I did see people that came in pairs would have one person wait in line while the other one looked around. I personally thought it was a really good sale. To give you an idea of the sales my mom got a lot of quality clothes, pots etc (21 items total) for $160!! My brother got really nice sunglasses that were valued at $100, dress shoes, several pairs of button down shirts, several sweatpants/athletic clothes from champion/nike, and Nike slides for about $180. I got Quay sunglasses for $14.\n\n## Comment ID fvau1gw with +2 score by [(Cheapthrills96, Reddit, 2020-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/hbnjud/is_it_worth_checking_out_the_in_store_nordstrom/fvau1gw/) (in reply to ID hbnjud):\nI went.

I got several things that I had also ordered recently - going to return those and keep the super cheap ones I got now!

Lots of bloggers and Insta - Influencers make a big deal about their Nordi semi-annual sale hauls. You can get some amazing deals if you find items you want at Nordstrom, add them to your wishlist on the app or website, or just keep them in your cart and then when the semi-annual sale comes the discounts will be automatically applied. Of course, it really pays to be a rewards member and/or a card holder because you get access to the semi-annual sale earlier than others. The rewards membership is free and all you have to do is enter your phone number anytime you shop to get \"notes\" and they're pretty easy to get and redeem. \n\nPlus, personal preference, but Nordstrom stores are just the nicest. The layout is consistent and its design team just does such a nice job of making sure the space is open, airy, classy, bright and comfortable. I also think Nordstrom has the best options for makeup and fragrance. It is the only one that carries Jo Malone outside of Sephora in the U.S. which is my favorite fragrance brand. \n\nNordstrom just makes the in-person shopping experience feel really nice. They offer a free personal shopping experience which I have never done but would love to do where you go in and you tell them your size and style and they will pull pieces and curate some looks for you and the only thing you pay is what you end up buying.

My old roommates father was a former C-Suite level officer of Nordstrom. While he was visiting the house one weekend Nordstrom had come up and he told a story of how when Nordstorm was expanding, they'd bought a tire store and turned it into a Nordstrom.\n\nA few weeks after opening, a man walked in the front door and rolled a tire over to the main desk. The man went on about how he'd bought the tire from the previous tenant, and could no longer return it because the tire shop no longer existed. \n\nManager asked how much the tires were. Popped open the register, handed him what must've been a couple hundred in cash, thanked him, and sent the man on his way. \n\nFrom that point forward, Nordstrom has forever had a tire item code in it's database.\n\n## Comment ID gzenvd0 with +83 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-05-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/gzenvd0/) (in reply to ID nkrqd6):\nNordstrom has the best return policy of these!

It really must depend on where you‚Äôre located. In my experience (though I‚Äôm definitely not a major fashion expert, I have lived and shopped in a few different cities) Bloomingdales is equivalent with Macy‚Äôs. Nordstrom is a lot better than both. Saks is definitely the most expensive and definitely does have some higher quality items, but you‚Äôre going to be paying for it.\n\nI like Nordstrom the best personally. Even if I was an independently wealthy millionaire, I‚Äôm pretty sure that I‚Äôd chose to shop with them. Their return policy rocks. If you have a card (maybe even if you don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm not sure) they give you credits for free alterations which can be really awesome if you find something that you love but doesn‚Äôt fit you just right. \n\nI‚Äôve never bothered to do it, but you can call and give a general or specific list of things that you‚Äôre looking for (like vacation wear, casual stuff, something to wear to a friend or relatives wedding events, etc). A shopper will get a lot of stuff together and put it aside so that it‚Äôs ready for you to look over and try on when you show up. You don‚Äôt have to buy any of it either.\n\nWhen I‚Äôve went in just to browse and tried something on, the salesperson always offered to bring me other things if what I had didn‚Äôt work. If I said no thanks and didn‚Äôt buy anything, they were still friendly and sweet. \n\nIdk, I‚Äôve been to other places where I couldn‚Äôt walk for 5 minutes before someone new dying to sell me something would just pop out. I hated that, and haven‚Äôt experienced it at nordys.

I've only been inside one true saks once, so i can't comment on that shopping experience, but i definitely prefer shopping at nordstrom over Bloomingdale's. And the nordstrom shoe store is the best out of the 3.\n\nHonestly, I'm at the point where if i need something, i typically check just nordstrom first to see what's available at what price points before i branch out to other stores. It just has everything, the returns policy is excellent, the bathrooms are better maintained and better lit, they do some alterations for you, and their in-store restaurant is better than Bloomingdale's.\n\n## Comment ID h2vikv7 with +2 score by [(vegaslivin26, Reddit, 2021-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/h2vikv7/) (in reply to ID nkrqd6):\nThey‚Äôre basically the same. Bloomingdale‚Äôs is Macy‚Äôs. It‚Äôs the same company. You‚Äôre paying for their overpriced Macy‚Äôs crap. Nordstrom you get their house brands which include actually decent merchandise that have been around for decades as well as the customer service that goes along with it. Neiman‚Äôs probably is considered the more exclusive department store in terms of brands carried, but Nordstrom actually does have the exact same depending on your location. Saks is equivalent to Neiman‚Äôs but with shorter in person hours & terrible service. I personally look at how many places have discount chain versions of their stores. They all do minus Neiman‚Äôs.

I work for a fashion brand that's sold in Nordstrom and I can guarantee that anything you find at Rack from us is the real deal.  Building out an entirely different and cheaper manufacturing process just to sell at Rack at a lower cost wouldn't be economically practical for us.  \n\nUsually when I find things at Rack from our brand, it's from the past season, whereas what is found in Nordstrom's is the current season.  For example, we're a denim focused brand, so you'll currently find lots of washes from the summer in Rack right now, whereas Nordstroms is only selling from our fall/winter collection. \n\nI can only speak for my brand, but I imagine it is a similar situation for others as well.\n\n### Comment ID f5xhivq with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5xhivq/) (in reply to ID f5xdpgm):\nThanks you for this information.

There is no Burberry made for Nordstrom Rack that will share the same label.

We'll get a like 20-min crash course on what to do. Find the return slip, look up the order, find the item being returned, credit the customer, throw it in a bag and send the item off to Inspections. \n\nWe are held to strict time standards and get less than 5 minutes to process each return. At that point, all we're looking for is the brand, size and color to match what was bought. So unless it's something glaringly obvious, like a different color, then any authenticity differences are not going to be noticed.\n\nThe next department (Inspections), checks to see how worn/damaged the item is, (but still isn't really trained much on signs of authenticity). \nAnd they get even less time @ literally 50 seconds per piece. \nThe running joke there is to just \"close your eyes and fold.\" \n\nOtherwise, actually inspecting the piece, lint rolling, cleaning, even buttoning it up, etc. takes up too much time. If you don't find a way to meet the time standards, eventually you'll lose your job. For most people, that way is to just not look too closely. \nI feel very bad about the quality they secondhand force us to send back out with the lousy time standards. I always say I don't hate the customer enough to work in Returns full time. \n\nAnyway, after inspecting, the piece is marked \"Good\" or \"Poor\". If it's \"Good\", it will go back to stock.\n\nIf it's \"Good\" but out of season, (since we accept returns from 100 years ago), it will then go to...boom, Nordstrom Rack. \n\nWe process tens of thousands of orders per day. I think the record right now is almost 40k in a day. \n\nSo, yeahhh totally possible. \n¬Ø\\_(;--;)_/¬Ø\n\n### Comment ID eysioy4 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-09-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/eysioy4/) (in reply to ID eysh8ft):\nThank you for the insight!\n\n### Comment ID f24sjcy with +1 score by [(mitch8893, Reddit, 2019-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/f24sjcy/) (in reply to ID eysh8ft):\nI am curious..

      "# Post ID h9y3ub: Nordstrom App tip and share your best shopping tips as well! with +247 score by [(quietisland, Reddit, 2020-06-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/h9y3ub/nordstrom_app_tip_and_share_your_best_shopping/)\nSince Nordstrom has been having a ton of really good sales - well kinda non-stop since March, just wanted to share some notes about the wish list features they have. Start by making a wishlist or two. I suggest making two wishlists, one for your actual regular shopping, and one that includes anything you want to track. Then in the app, turn on \"Notify me when an item goes on sale or comes back in stock.\"\n\nThen, Nordstrom sends you a notification when anything on your list(s) get reduced in price. And the 'back in stock' is a game changer during clearance time. When people cancel their orders, or stock was updated in a store and added back to inventory, you get a notification. I have picked up a few items I missed the first time thanks to this second one. \n\nNordstrom Rack as of now does not have this feature, but fingers crossed moving forward. \n\nI think shopbop is supposed to do the same with your hearts and lists, but I have only received emails about my cart from them, so I am not sure what the deal is. I do love how your hearts becomes a custom catalog though, so I am not complaining. :)\n\nDo you have any tips for shopping your fave store?

Lucky Brand, too.\n\nIf you're into short-sleeved button downs, Marshall's and TJ Maxx usually have shirts by a designer named Ricky Singh. Some long-sleeves, too. Usually the lines are called \"Cactus Man\" or \"Denim and Flower\" or something, those are my favorites. They're 100% cotton and feels thickish, and they're durable, those shirts have lasted me a couple of years despite my shit ass care of them. They also make my fat torso look good. The designs are hit and miss but IMO when they do hit, they're great and decent quality.\n\nI honestly find Nordstrom Rack to be full of overpriced garbage, even if it's \"Clearance.\" Ross is mostly cheap quality stuff, too, but at least it's priced cheap.\n\nOne time I was at Nordstrom Rack and I was looking at the Lucky Brand jeans their normal section, and they were like $40, and then I looked at the Lucky Brand jeans sitting on the Clearance Rack and they were...$40.\n\n### Comment ID elye02g with +25 score by [(jeffthedunker, Reddit, 2019-04-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/bi5acq/discount_clothing_store_gotos_marshalls_nordstrom/elye02g/) (in reply to ID ely81va):\nGot a Denim and Flower button down that I love about a year ago, good to know Cactus Man is the same.

But they aren‚Äôt as choosy and bougie as one might think. The takeaway is this: If you, like me, equate the name ‚ÄúNordstrom‚Äù with high-quality, luxury brands (like Nordstrom used to carry exclusively), that is no longer the case.** \n\n**Because something has been sold at Nordstrom Rack (like Byroe), it does not mean it was once sold at Nordstrom and just went on clearance. Just because something is sold at Nordstrom (or Nordstrom Rack), it no longer should imply quality or luxury, like my poor-person brain thought it still did. Oh, and don‚Äôt pick the Byroe serum. The ingredients are terrible.**\n\nI recently saw a post about how Grace & Stella (an admitted private label company) is now selling their products at Nordstrom. \n\nThis made me remember the times that I‚Äôve questioned a brand‚Äôs legitimacy, only to be reassured of their quality when I saw the products were available to purchase at Nordstrom (a luxury retailer).\n\nI once saw somebody comment that the Byroe toner was Boxycharm including a product with an artificially inflated price point, and I defended them by saying, ‚ÄúThis is not the same as the $90 brush set situation. They sell Byroe at Nordstrom. $90 is the actual price.‚Äù\n\n~~I alsowondered why I had never heard of Malin + Goetz before seeing them in beauty boxes, but when I looked them up, I saw that they were for sale at Nordstrom.com. This led me to believe that Malin + Goetz is a prestige brand.~~\n\nBut when it was brought to my attention that Grace & Stella was being sold at Nordstrom.com, I was like whaaa...? \n\nI know for a fact that Grace & Stella is not a luxury brand. I‚Äôm not saying that all private labeling is bad - but when I think of a product being sold at Nordstrom, I assume it‚Äôs on par with Jo Malone, Khiel‚Äôs, Dior, etc., which I know Grace & Stella is *not*. \n\nSo I did some research, and it turns out [anybody can sell](https://www.acenda.com/content/sell-on-nordstrom) at Nordstrom.com. That‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt find Byroe ~~or Malin + Goetz~~ for sale anywhere else.\n\nJust a PSA, in case anybody else was still looking at Nordstrom as a luxury retailer, aka from a 1990s point of view.\n\nEdit: ok so I was wrong about Malin + Goetz (it shows up at other retailers if you search for that retailer specifically), but I‚Äôm doubling down on Byroe. Take today‚Äôs Boxycharm choice of [Tomato Serum](https://byroe.com/products/tomato-serum).  The first four ingredients are cheap moisturizers and fillers, and the 5th ingredient is alcohol. Tomato extract is the 47th out of 48 ingredients.

Former Nordstrom corporate employee here. This isn't exactly true. Nordstrom doesn't let just anyone sell products like Amazon or Walmart.  Nordstrom does have a drop ship program, but a vendor still has to pass through a process and a buyer has to want the merchandise. [This list that was referenced](https://www.nordstrom.com/browse/nordstrom-cares/partnership-guidelines) is customer facing, it is definitely not all of the requirements for becoming a drop ship partner. This is a broad overview for curious people. They are not going to state \"you must be a luxury brand\" explicitly on a customer facing page, they are more about creating the \"atmosphere\" of luxury or if they state that a brand is luxury it's usually with a euphemism or about how something feels. I know that their image is what is keeping them afloat in this brutal retail world so I don't think they would throw that away to become an online marketplace.\n\nThey are probably selling Grace and Stella because, as someone else mentioned, they are hype right now, and Nordstrom wanted to cash in on that. Grace and Stella's marketing team is much smarter than face skin's; they have a much better image. I agree that this was a miss for them, and I doubt they would have agreed to the partnership if they knew they were alibaba crap. Nordstrom sold Goop gemstones for like $80 that were \"blessed\" by someone named Heather. They want to jump on trends.\n\n### Comment ID g15i8sa with +3 score by [(pounce_the_panther, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g15i8sa/) (in reply to ID g14xn25):\nAll of the Grace and Stella items I can find are in the Pop Up shop.

Thanks for taking the time to give your input. \n\nI guess my point was this - I was excited for the Byroe toner because I saw it at Nordstrom Rack. \n\nI thought all products at Nordstrom Rack were products that were once sold at Nordstrom and had gone on clearance, so I used the fact that the Byroe toner was on clearance ‚Äúfor $29.97 from $95‚Äù [at Nordstrom Rack](https://www.nordstromrack.com/shop/product/3115305/byroe-bitter-green-essence-toner?color=GREEN) as clear evidence that Byroe is a legitimate luxury brand, and the Byroe toner was once sold at Nordstrom proper for $95. \n\nI‚Äôm probably not the only person here who thought the Nordstrom name was equivalent to a legitimate product. \n\nIt says 86% off, which gives the impression to me, an un-savvy shopper, that Nordstrom buyers think the Byroe toner is worth $95, because Nordstrom at one point ‚Äúcarried it.‚Äù \n\nDoes that make sense? I used the Nordstrom name as evidence of Byroe‚Äôs legitimacy when in conversation with others, but I now realize that that was not a valid argument. \n\nThe Byroe Tomato serum is a choice for a Boxy Premium today (and the ingredients are not worth $150), so I still think the post is important, just in case a fellow un-savvy shopper mistakenly assumed that Byroe = Nordstrom = Quality, when it does not mean that in the same way that it used to.\n\n#### Comment ID g15t78k with +14 score by [(Ditovontease, Reddit, 2020-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g15t78k/) (in reply to ID g15cll9):\nNever assume Rack is the same as Nordstrom.

Malin + Goetz is definitely a legit brand, they are sold at a lot of the major retailers for years. They also have been supplying products to a lot of luxury hotels etc. so it fits that top tier status, in my opinion. It might not be a brand targeted to a young demographic so I don't think they do a lot of social media marketing. You can find them on Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, Sephora, Saks Fifth, their own boutiques and other retailers too. \n2. IDK about Byroe, since I am not interested in their products and haven't come across them.\n3. Grace & Stella is a brand, a millenial/gen-z/IG hyped up brand, that is. I haven't done my research but I would assume Nordstrom sells them because of their following, their \"aesthetic\" and their clout. LOL. So people who are interested in the brand would drive traffic to Nordstrom and perhaps buy other products from Nordstrom too, which gives them more money. Grace & Stella is a brand disguising as a luxury brand... They have good marketers and brand relationship managers to be honest, being able to get this far. Props to them.\n4. To your point, yes you are correct Grace & Stella is not a luxury brand when you compare it to Chanel, Dior and other brands being sold at Nordstrom. However, I also don't think Nordstrom = Walmart, Amazon where it's a free for all marketplace. I'm sure the brands go through an approval process where both parties benefit from the exposure and sales they get from Nordstrom. That's why there is no Wet & Wild or LA Girl there. Grace & Stella sells their stuff on a higher price point than drugstore and are aligning themselves to the likes of Saturday Skin, Youth to the People, Herbivore and other cutesy packaging, millenial reaching skincare brands *hence maybe why* you also see them at Nordstrom.\n\n### Comment ID g14nvrt with +19 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14nvrt/) (in reply to ID g14lg38):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID g14qpad with +13 score by [(biancae1izabeth, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14qpad/) (in reply to ID g14nvrt):\nYeah I'm with you!

Anyone who has had their images stolen by Alibaba and wish sellers knows that the product you're getting is RARELY the same thing as is shown in the picture. The picture is almost always a higher quality item that the cheap wholesale seller is duping. If you want to find instances of this, just take a look at simplynailogical's 500 videos about stolen content on wish - it is a huge problem especially for smaller brands and unknown creators to have their content stolen by online retailers because they have very little excess cash and legal backing to get them taken down. \n\n2 the items that YOU buy off alibaba, even if it seems to be the exact same product as something else, are rarely the same product a private labeler is buying. Private label companies don't log into alibaba and buy a bulk inventory and then repackage the goods. They contact a factory to have items specifically made for their order, often already with their private label on them or entirely unlabeled so that the company can brand them themselves and repackage in higher quality packaging. You can see this with practically all the hair accessories you can buy at any major retailer across the US. It is the same stuff with a different name on it. Theres only so many ways to make a Bobby pin! Private labelers dont automatically have bad quality just because they private label, they're just rebranding existing products and sometimes that product is crap and sometimes it isnt. A huge, well known private labeling company you all know and love is Trader Joe's. The majority of their products are existing products made by other brands relabeled for trader Joe's, sometimes with slight variations just so the trader Joe's one has a different ingredient list. Sometimes they just change the names on the ingredients even so you cant find their dupes, like using the chemical name for banana extract instead of just saying \"banana extract\". There is a big difference between you buying skincare from wish and the brand buying their original unlabeled product, #1 being when they import things to the US under their new private label, their stock is all going to be identical, whereas if you buy two of the exact same items off wish you could end up with two totally different products. Thats because Even private labelers have quality control. I think there is a lot of confusion about this especially on this app because of the one major private label scandal we all know that came up and now everyone thinks all private labelers are trying to poison us, but one of the reasons that story got so big is because they weren't just private labeling, they were doing it very badly and not doing proper quality control, which was the only reason anyone even knew they were a private labeler. Had they done a great job, you probably never would have known. Other private labelers will do everything they can not to make the same mistakes, because they dont want a scandal to marr their brands. Dls probably spends more trying to dig out of the pit from their scandal than they do on any other marketing by creating new brands all the time. They Have to make new brands to survive. No other brand wants to be in the same shoes as dls.\n\n3 almost all products' retail value are roughly 10% material cost, 10% packaging, 20% marketing, and 60% profit margin. The marketing they do isnt always to consumers. They also have to market to retailers to get them to carry their products\n\n4 luxury brands produce products in china too. Everyone does. Huge workforce, low labor and infrastructure costs. It just makes sense if you want to drive your costs down as much as possible. If they're not producing out of china it is from Indonesia, Thailand, anywhere they can drive the wages into the dirt. Some (not all!!! But some!!) Comments about chinese produced goods are borderline xenophobic without really considering that it isnt China, but the US that creates the horrible factory conditions and encourages costs to be cut as low as possible. Chinese factories have to compete with eachother for US brands to pick them, they're not just jerks trying to screw over one another. They're responding to the market factors created by US industry\n\nSorry I just kinda went off a bit but every time I see posts saying \"tHis bRAnD is alIBabA TrASh\" I go into angry-supply-chain-explanation-mode and my eyes turn red. \n\nAlso, why do people think Nordstrom is luxury? It seems just like any department store to me, is there some sort of department store hierarchy I dont know about? Where is Von Marr on the hierarchy? Because they're my favorite. They have nursing rooms with rocking chairs so I think they're the coolest\n\nAlso also, I too loved to swipe the malin and goetz from the hotel when leaving. Them and Crabtree & Evelyn are the two I like to keep\n\n### Comment ID g14nbqc with +21 score by [(grnidgurl, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14nbqc/) (in reply to ID g14lg38):\nGrace & Stella is just a notch above DLS (Dirthy Little Secrets). They buy their products off AliBaba, repackage them and sell them at a 5000% markup.

They are usually around $20 retail I think at full-price. They \\*are\\* cheap looking dresses, but they aren't pretending at luxury here. These are items on super clearance at Nordstom's discount outlet, they probably just want them out the door. Since the clothes are manufactured by Nordstrom, they can either sell NPG items at a higher markup (which you can find in full price stores, with better materials) or at a lower price (at rack). Nordstrom tries to be pretty careful with their overseas manufacturers, but they are still overseas manufacturers. They are probably still turning a low profit on these dresses or selling them at cost (I have seen clearances lose money because I have seen markups, but this is probably not that). So there is something to be said about the ethics of a profitable $5 dress, but probably for a different subreddit.\n\n## Comment ID g14kxv9 with +4 score by [(radbu107, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14kxv9/) (in reply to ID i7wd1s):\nTo add to this, what do you guys think about Oryza eyeshadow that is offered through Ipsy?

To us, it's \"you're gonna get such a good deal!\" whereas to brands it's \"you're going to get so many loyal customers by selling at an initial discount!\"\n\nIt's optional to believe this part of my post here as I can't back up in-person experiences with receipts, but: I actually met with a small brand founder whose products had been featured in a beauty box. This founder told me that they got a LOT of reviews from this move but not a lot of sales. Which...I could have guessed that part. But said founder was truly surprised by this.\n\nOf course you all know that we sub to boxes for deals, not for loyalty per say (or I'm speaking personally lol, I'll switch brands based on better prices!) \n\nNow with Byroe, my experience is more limited - but from my interactions, I'd say they really are aiming for a luxury brand (it's not Alibaba repackaged). Are their prices absurd? I mean...what luxury brand isn't? La Mer? ReVive? The price tags are goofy to me as someone who uses The Ordinary. But it's still in line with other luxury, and the experience is definitely in line with those brands as well.\n\nSo tbh I was surprised to see Byroe in Boxy but I've got two possible conclusions: either they hope to gain more popularity or they're selling their products at a markdown to maintain freshness (which is actually great, the brand is pretty young).\n\n## Comment ID g14g4sv with +2 score by [(e925, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14g4sv/) (in reply to ID i7wd1s):\nNo pun intended with the Point of View comment üòÇ\n\n## Comment ID g14m7lx with +2 score by [(MariposaSunrise, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14m7lx/) (in reply to ID i7wd1s):\nI usually use Sephora as my test to see if it is a high quality luxury brand.\n\n### Comment ID g14q21y with +5 score by [(e925, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14q21y/) (in reply to ID g14m7lx):\nFor sure - there are a lot of good brands at Ulta too!

If I book a personal styling appointment and let them know my style and size range, will they order stuff in to the store from the website that I can actually try on? I‚Äôve always wanted to do it but the idea of going and then trying on everything the stylist brings and nothing fitting fills me with a middle school level self conscious anxiety\n\n#### Comment ID ku325o8 with +2 score by [(messyarts, Reddit, 2024-03-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/1b9qft1/silly_question_about_shopping_at_nordstrom/ku325o8/) (in reply to ID ku16179):\nHey! This is a great question. We used to do internal transfers from other stores for free all the time‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure how they have adapted for e-commerce. I don‚Äôt think they will do it, only because shipping is free online.\n\nIn this case, I would find a gal that looks similar in proportions that just works there. They should be asking everyone if they need help (how I know things have changed) right when they get there. Just tell them this exactly, there are tons of pieces you want to try and don‚Äôt want to order things only to return. And doesn‚Äôt have to only be clothes‚Ä¶ we are talking makeup, lingerie, shit, home goods! We cross sell, they can take you around the whole store. You don‚Äôt need a ‚Äústylist‚Äù appointment. We were all stylists. If they are good at their job they will blow you away.\n\nI was a solid 31 waist and that was overweight back then‚Ä¶ (many things did stop at 30, size 10/12) I would get folks asking me for help for those reasons and I would take them all around the store. I knew which brands ran big and could easily fit me, and which ones didn‚Äôt. Esp mothers with young ladies‚Ä¶ those were my best days, when we found cute as fuck clothes for a teen who hated shopping. \n\nI would probably just order things from online and return unfortunately. It is kind of the norm now anyway, you just don‚Äôt get the great one on one service.\n\n#### Comment ID ku66ul8 with +2 score by [(PlantedinCA, Reddit, 2024-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/1b9qft1/silly_question_about_shopping_at_nordstrom/ku66ul8/) (in reply to ID ku16179):\nNordstrom [fairly recently started requiring their house brands to extend to 18 or 20](https://press.nordstrom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nordstrom-expands-extended-sizing-30-stores-100-brands/). And they are merchandising brands that have plus and straight - with all their stuff together.  \n\nMy local store carries plus in store (I am more like 18/20) and I found that all of the stores in my area had some. But one store aimed for a younger audience than the other and had way better stuff.  Jeans tend to be well stocked at all stores. But there were some more fun dresses and non-work wear at the other store. \n\nThey do a better job stocking in store than other brands. I‚Äôd do a quick shop in store on Nordstrom.com to see what that have in store.\n\n## Comment ID ktxenjf with +16 score by [(WalterBishRedLicrish, Reddit, 2024-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/1b9qft1/silly_question_about_shopping_at_nordstrom/ktxenjf/) (in reply to ID 1b9qft1):\nThis is the way I buy all my clothes. I shop at Nordstrom frequently because I have the credit card and I get points to spend there. For me, I cannot for the life of me figure out if something is flattering,  comfortable, and fits the circumstances in which I would wear it unless I try it on at home. I will wear a garment for half an hour or so to figure it out. Whatever I don't like, or if I need a different size, I return in store. While I'm there I'll purchase items i didn't need to try on. But you can return via mail I think. I acknowledge there is privilege in doing this because I can afford the upfront costs.   \n\nEdit: meant to say that I just order online when I do this. Also forgot to mention that Nordstrom has a great return policy.\n\n## Comment ID ktxo8n4 with +8 score by [(readermom123, Reddit, 2024-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/1b9qft1/silly_question_about_shopping_at_nordstrom/ktxo8n4/) (in reply to ID 1b9qft1):\nI usually get it delivered to my house and then return to store if I don't want it. I agree about shopping online being stinky. At the same time lots of time stuff isn't available in stores so it's the only way to do it! Nordstrom is VERY easy to do returns with though.\n\n## Comment ID ktxrrwb with +6 score by [(MyDentistIsACat, Reddit, 2024-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/1b9qft1/silly_question_about_shopping_at_nordstrom/ktxrrwb/) (in reply to ID 1b9qft1):\nI think this must be a common way to go about it.

It's not the miracle I was hoping for- I was imagining someone bringing me whole, interesting outfits including shoes to try on. What actually happened on my first appointment was we communicated by text a few times and I gave her a list of types of things I wanted plus my sizes and some preferred brands.  \n\nWe scheduled an appointment. When I got there she had a huge dressing room set up for me with SO MANY CLOTHES!  Most were variations of what I had requested, with a few unexpected more casual items too. She pretty much just left me to try stuff and came back 2-3 times to see if I needed different sizes, etc. There wasn't any help actually styling outfits but it did save me the time of going through and finding things.\n\nI went mostly to find business formal pieces as I had been WFH for a couple years and my things felt dated. She had a ton of different options of black suits and a bunch of blouses.  It was like looking in my existing closet. She did find a few casual items that I wouldn't have tried on my own but loved.  I ended up spending $500-600 on things. I have since used her 2 more times but only for specific events (I needed a dress for a wedding, etc).\n\nI still recommend trying it as an option- I think a lot depends on the stylist you get. It's free and saves you time. \n\nI had much more success using a stylebox service called FrontDoor Fashion. You can order a box of things to try on and they send you about 10-12 items, put together in actual outfits.  It's much more personalized that something like Stitchfix. The items are more expensive but you have a stylist who is in contact with you v things being picked via an algorithm. It's a $100 deposit but if you keep nothing I believe you get it back.  I've never kept nothing though!  I've gotten great items and it‚Äôs how I found my recent interview suit. If you choose to keep the same stylist the boxes really do get better as they learn your style.  My stylist will contact me sometimes randomly and send a pic of an item she thinks I'll like and ask if I want to try it.\n\n### Comment ID ku3p1d8 with +2 score by [(Loveandeggs, Reddit, 2024-03-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/1b9qft1/silly_question_about_shopping_at_nordstrom/ku3p1d8/) (in reply to ID ktxwm1c):\nYeah I haven‚Äôt had good luck with the in-store stylist either.   First time I went, I was looking for toppers that weren‚Äôt blazers for work, and she had pulled blazers and jean jackets.

The app creates a QR code, so all you have to do is get the box sealed, and the carrier prints the label.  +1 for shipping, especially around the holidays.  I don't live too close (I have 2 good Nordstrom about two hours one way, and 1 middling one about 2 hours in a different direction) to a store, and am usually only regularly around the middling one ~once per month.\n\nIf, however, I had a good enough reason to make a day of it:  I would absolutely go to one or both of the 2 better Nordstrom, in person.  They will likely have stock in store that isn't shown online, personal attention, tailoring, etc.  The experience can just be fun, and relaxing.\n\nI might call to make an appointment with an assistant\\shopper.  They may hold your choices so you can try them and any other selections made in store, if you decide to visit.\n\nAlso, either way, I would create a Nordstrom account with your email so any returns and bonus notes are more easily streamlined.\n\n## Comment ID kty8i97 with +1 score by [(sunniyam, Reddit, 2024-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/1b9qft1/silly_question_about_shopping_at_nordstrom/kty8i97/) (in reply to ID 1b9qft1):\nI do this also because it saves on shipping cost and waste of packaging.

There was never a moment of dragging my feet on Mondays with them. \n\nThen.. I had the unfortunate experience of working with one who was just... not great. They needed a lot to work on, from people skills to micro-management, they had several other red flags screaming toxic management. Yet, leadership unfortunately seems to like these types of individuals and so they stay; thereby, promoting a pretty insidious culture. Because of that, I feel Nordstrom leadership has lost its way...and lost trust with many employees. \n\nI accept that company culture changes all the time, and since the world is still healing from the pandemic, it's just a rough time for everyone right now.

I didn‚Äôt get my benefits until I had been there for around six months and after hours were cut I wouldn‚Äôt have been keeping them past the measurement period anyway so it was not worth it to stay even for the benefits. I also found that the goals were difficult to meet and were not proportionally adapted when our hours were cut which felt punitive.

The relationship between product and engineering is terrible, with tech consistently looking for opportunities to throw product under the bus, which this SVP encouraged.

You‚Äôre expected to process lots of returns that was not part of the description until recently; clean up after your other co-workers and leaving you with little time for actual sales to make commission. Because of the store‚Äôs generous return policy, the customers abuse the system which in turns affects sales person commission and take home pay. Hardworking employees are penalized and made to take on responsibilities of other employees who skimmed through work. Many managers are not a presence on the floor and most of the time if a sales person require assistance from manager, they could hardly be located and messages ignored.",

There was never a moment of dragging my feet on Mondays with them. \n\nThen.. I had the unfortunate experience of working with one who was just... not great. They needed a lot to work on, from people skills to micro-management, they had several other red flags screaming toxic management. Yet, leadership unfortunately seems to like these types of individuals and so they stay; thereby, promoting a pretty insidious culture. Because of that, I feel Nordstrom leadership has lost its way...and lost trust with many employees. \n\nI accept that company culture changes all the time, and since the world is still healing from the pandemic, it's just a rough time for everyone right now.

      "# [Nordstrom by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2003-04-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom)\nAmerican luxury department store chain\n\nThis article is about the department store chain. For other uses, see Nordstrom (disambiguation).\n\nNordstrom, Inc. ( ) is an American luxury department store chain headquartered in Seattle, Washington, and founded by John W. Nordstrom and Carl F. Wallin in 1901. The original store operated exclusively as a shoe store, and a second location opened in 1923. The growing chain began selling clothing in 1963, and became the full-line retailer that presently exists by 1971. The company founded its off-price Nordstrom Rack division in 1973, and grew both full-line and off-price divisions throughout the United States in the following years. The full-line division competes with department stores including Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, and Saks Fifth Avenue, while the off-price division competes with retailers including the TJX Companies and Ross Stores.[4] Previous expansions beyond the contiguous United States include Puerto Rico (2015‚Äì2020) and Canada (2014‚Äì2023).\n\nEarly history\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn W. Nordstrom was born on February 15, 1871, in the village Alvik near Lule√• in Northern Sweden.[5] In 1887, Nordstrom immigrated to the United States at the age of 16.[5][6] His name at birth was Johan Wilhelm Nordstr√∂m (Swedish pronunciation: [ÀàjuÀêh…ën Ààv…™lh…õlm ÀànuÀêr(d)str≈ìm]), which he later anglicized to John W. Nordstrom. After landing in New York, he began working in Michigan and was able to save enough money to purchase a 20-acre (81,000 m2) potato farm in Arlington, Washington.[5] In 1897, he joined the Klondike Gold Rush in Canada's Yukon Territory. After two years of prospecting, he finally struck gold, but sold his disputed claim for $13,000.[5] Returning to Seattle with his newfound wealth, he married Hilda Carlson in 1900 and searched for a business venture.[5]\n\nOperations during 20th century\n\n[edit]\n\nWallin & Nordstrom and Nordstrom Best\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom eventually settled on a shoe store that opened in 1901, called Wallin & Nordstrom.[6] Carl F. Wallin, the co-founder of the store, was the owner of the adjacent shoe repair shop.[5] John and Hilda had five children, three of whom would follow him into the family business, Everett W. (1903), Elmer J. (1904) and Lloyd N. Nordstrom.[7][8]\n\nIn 1928, John W. Nordstrom retired and sold his shares to two of his sons, Everett and Elmer. In 1929, Wallin also retired and sold his shares to them. The 1930 grand opening of the remodeled Second Avenue store marked the change of name to Nordstrom. Lloyd Nordstrom subsequently joined the company in 1933, and the three brothers ran the business together for almost forty years.[9]\n\nBy 1958, Nordstrom had expanded to eight stores in two states but still sold only shoes. Apparel came with its purchase of Best's Apparel of Seattle in 1963, and the company's name was changed to Nordstrom Best.[10]\n\nFollowing renaming to Nordstrom\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1971, the company was taken public on National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ). It was one of the first companies to be listed on the then-newly established stock exchange.[11] It was moved to the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 under the ticker symbol JWN after John W. Nordstrom, its founder.[10]\n\nTheir business continued beyond stores in 1974. On December 5, the National Football League announced the signing of a franchise agreement that would put a team in Seattle, Washington. Representing the family as majority partner of the consortium was Lloyd W. Nordstrom. However, he would never see a game as owner, as he died of a heart attack on January 20, 1976, eight months before the newly christened Seattle Seahawks took the field.[12] With his death, the estate of Mr. Nordstrom would oversee the team, with co-owner and entrepreneur Herman Sarkowsky serving as the team's first chief operating officer.[13][14]\n\nBy 1975, Nordstrom expanded into Alaska (the only time by acquisition) by purchasing Northern Commercial Company and opened its first Nordstrom Rack clearance store in Seattle. A strong northwest regional retailer with sales already approaching $250 million making it the third-largest specialty retailer in the United States, the company opened its first Southern California store at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa in 1978.[15] By the early 1990s, it had opened 26 stores plus Racks in California. Subsequent expansion relied on creating a strongly decentralized regional structure, beginning with the Northeast in the Tysons Corner Center in Virginia (1988), the Midwest in the Oakbrook Center in Illinois (1991), the Southeast in Atlanta (1998), and the Southwest in Dallas (1996). In a new region, the initial store was used as a base for training and recruitment for subsequent expansion, and was usually backed by its own distribution center. From 1978 to 1995, Nordstrom opened a total of 46 full-line department stores.[16]\n\nIn 1976, Nordstrom opened a series of stores called Place Two to sell a more limited selection of apparel in smaller markets. By 1983, there were ten Place Two stores, but the cost of upgrading the smaller stores, especially from a systems perspective, outweighed the benefit, and the division was discontinued.[17] The last two remaining Place Two stores closed on April 1, 1995.[18] In August 1988, the Nordstroms sold the Seahawks to real estate developer Ken Behring and his partner Ken Hofmann for $80 million.[19][20][21]\n\nThe company also expanded into direct sales in 1993, beginning with a catalog division[22] led by John N.'s son Dan that was followed by an e-commerce business. Nordstrom.com's fulfillment and contact centers are located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Seattle, Washington. Currently, it has distribution centers in Ontario, California; Newark, California; Portland, Oregon; Dubuque, Iowa; Upper Marlboro, Maryland; and Gainesville, Florida.\n\nNordstrom FSB, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nordstrom, Inc., is a federally chartered savings bank doing business as Nordstrom Bank. It was formed in 1991 in Scottsdale, Arizona, with its customer contact center in Centennial, Colorado. Nordstrom FSB was formerly known as Nordstrom National Credit Bank and changed its name to Nordstrom FSB in March 2000. The bank offers various banking and credit products, such as Nordstrom Signature VISA, Nordstrom retail credit and debit cards, interest-bearing checking accounts, check cards, and certificates of deposits. It offers Nordstrom customers cards under Nordstrom Rewards ‚Äì its customer loyalty program ‚Äì where customers earn points when making purchases with the card at Nordstrom and other retailers.\n\nIn 1995, Nordstrom opened their first store location in New York State.[23] It is located at The Westchester, an upscale shopping mall in White Plains, New York, a suburb of New York City. Nordstrom has since opened stores at Roosevelt Field in Garden City, New York in 1997,[24] and Manhattan in 2019.[25]\n\nBeginning in 1995, the fourth generation of brothers and cousins had been co-presidents for a time. John Whitacre was appointed as the first non-Nordstrom CEO in 1997.[26] In 1998, Nordstrom replaced its downtown Seattle store with a new flagship location in the former Frederick & Nelson building across the street. A two-year renovation of this location was completed in 2016.[27] At 383,000 square feet (35,600 m2), the downtown Seattle location is the chain's largest store. By contrast, the smallest Nordstrom store, as of September 2008, opened in 1980 in Salem, Oregon, with a total area of just under 72,000 square feet (6,700 m2). This location has since closed.\n\nIn 1998, Nordstrom opened its first location in the Southeast at Perimeter Mall in Atlanta, Georgia.[28]\n\nOperations during 21st century\n\n[edit]\n\n2000‚Äì2009\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2000, the Nordstrom family reasserted its control, with the sons of Bruce A. (Blake, Erik and Peter) assuming senior roles in the company which they continue to hold.[29] Blake Nordstrom served as sole President of the company from 2000 to 2014 with Erik and Peter joining him as co-Presidents in 2015.[30]\n\nNordstrom sold its stand-alone boutique chain Fa√ßonnable in 2007, though it still offers that label in its lineup.\n\n2010‚Äì2019\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2011, Nordstrom announced the acquisition of HauteLook, an LA-based online retailer that offers flash sales on designer goods. The deal included Nordstrom paying $180 million in stock and a three-year \"earn-out\" payment based on HauteLook's financial performance.[31] On May 26, 2011, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing the downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, Circle Center Mall location due to declining business at the site. The remaining location on the north side of the city at the Fashion Mall at Keystone as well as the future Nordstrom Rack store in the Rivers Edge Shopping Center, also on the north side, remained as the only two locations in the state. Erik Nordstrom, president of stores at Nordstrom stated, \"We've enjoyed serving our customers in downtown Indianapolis, but unfortunately our business has declined over the long term for some time and despite our efforts to turn things around we don't see the outlook significantly changing.\"[32]\n\nIn August 2011, Nordstrom opened the store Treasure & Bond in SoHo, New York. Intended to test the waters of the tumultuous high-end department store scene in New York, all profits of Treasure & Bond are donated to charity. The customer base of the smaller store is thought to be the younger sisters of the typical Nordstrom customer.[33]\n\nNordstrom announced plans to open a Nordstrom Rack in Milwaukee in 2014.[34] In late November 2012, Nordstrom announced that they would also be opening a full-line Nordstrom Department Store in 2015 in Milwaukee at Mayfair Mall, a half-mile away from the Nordstrom Rack location. Milwaukee was the largest metropolitan area in the country that did not have a Nordstrom until 2015. Such unmet demand was highlighted in Nordstrom's decision to open in the Milwaukee area.[35]\n\nOn January 4, 2013, Nordstrom announced plans for a new location in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan region. The store, to be located at the Ridgedale Center, would be the second in the area. Following the success of its Mall of America opening in 1992, Nordstrom sought to expand in the Twin Cities market.[36] Plans for a Ridgedale Center store were first released in 2007, only to be canceled in 2009.[37] The location eventually opened in September 2015.\n\nNordstrom opened a 138,000-square-foot, two-level, full-line store March 2015 in The Mall of San Juan in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[38] After Hurricane Maria in 2017, the store suffered major water damage and it closed temporarily after the hurricane. Nordstrom reopened the store on November 9, 2018.[39] On May 7, 2020, Nordstrom announced that it would not reopen due to COVID-19 pandemic, leaving this store closed permanently.\n\nIn May 2015, Pete and Erik Nordstrom joined their brother Blake Nordstrom as co-presidents of Nordstrom. This arrangement lasted until Blake Nordstrom's death in January 2019.[40] Before this appointment, Pete Nordstrom was executive vice president and president of merchandising while Erik Nordstrom was executive vice president and president of Nordstrom.com.[40]\n\nNordstrom opened its first Rack location in Philadelphia in the fall of 2014.[41] In the fall of 2015, Nordstrom opened their first Nordstrom Rack store in Delaware.[42] The company is opening its first full-line store in New York City on April 12, 2018, a three-floor store at 57th Street and Broadway, in the Columbus Circle neighborhood.[43]\n\nIn 2016, Nordstrom entered into a partnership with Tesla Motors under which the automaker opened retail galleries inside the Nordstrom locations in The Grove, Los Angeles, in SouthPark Mall in Charlotte, North Carolina and in Somerset Collection in Troy, Michigan.[44][45]\n\nIn 2016, Nordstrom began selling products from J. Crew, Olivia Palermo + Chelsea28, Adore Me, and Eloquii.[46][47][48][49] In 2017, Nordstrom announced they would be expanding their natural beauty-focused stations.[50]\n\nOn February 2, 2017, Bloomberg News reported that Nordstrom would cease to carry Ivanka Trump's branded fashion line, citing weak sales. The retailer cuts 10 percent of its most poorly performing brands each year. Nordstrom's action came after a boycott campaign against retailers carrying products having Trump family labels.[51][52] President Donald Trump responded with a tweet directed at Nordstrom, condemning the brand for its treatment of his daughter. The company's stock dropped by 0.65% in the aftermath of the tweet before ending the day with a gain of more than 4%. Fortune declared this quick recovery to have broken Trump's market-moving \"tweet curse\".[53][54][55][56]\n\nIn October 2017, Nordstrom launched its first \"Nordstrom Local\" in West Hollywood, which is set to focus on personal shopping and styling, rather than carrying merchandise. In June 2017, Nordstrom Inc.'s founding family, which owned 31.2 percent of the company, said it was looking to take Nordstrom private.[57] In October, the family suspended its efforts, because of trouble completing a financing package.[58] Lenders were asking for 13 percent interest, about twice the typical rate for retailers.[59]\n\nOn January 2, 2019 Blake Nordstrom, co-president of Nordstrom, died suddenly at the age of 58. He was a lifetime employee of his family's company, rising through the ranks until he became a vice-president and then co-president.[60]\n\nIn fiscal year 2019, digital sales reached 33% of total sales, marking a growing transition to online retail.[61]\n\n2020‚Äìpresent\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 3, 2020, Erik Nordstrom became the sole CEO of Nordstrom.[62]\n\nOn March 16, the company announced that effective the following day, all locations would temporarily close during the COVID-19 pandemic.[63] On May 5, Nordstrom began reopening stores and announced that sixteen locations would permanently close by August.[64][65]\n\nIn late September, Nordstrom announced that by the end of 2021, their stores and websites would no longer sell products made from fur or exotic skins.[66]\n\nIn October 2021, Nordstrom announced an agreement with 11 Honor√©, an online retailer of plus-sized designer fashion, to sell the company's clothing in Nordstrom stores and on their website.[67]\n\nNordstrom Canada\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom Canada Retail, Inc. (French: Les Detaillants Nordstrom Canada, Inc.) was the Canadian division of Nordstrom. It was announced on September 13, 2012, opened its first store on September 19, 2014, and closed its final stores on June 13, 2023. In this market, it competed with Canadian department stores including Holt Renfrew, Hudson's Bay, and Simons.[69]\n\nFour full-line Nordstrom stores were announced for the first phase of expansion, with nine full-line stores total expected in the long term.[70] Most of these stores were located in vacated Sears Canada storefronts in Cadillac Fairview-managed shopping centers, including Chinook Centre in Calgary; Rideau Centre in Ottawa; Toronto Eaton Centre in Toronto; and Pacific Centre in Vancouver. The stores at the CF-managed Sherway Gardens and the Oxford-managed Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto were new construction.[71] Of the first four stores announced, the Calgary store was the first to open on September 19, 2014.[72] It was followed by the Ottawa store on March 6, 2015;[73] the Vancouver store on September 18, 2015;[74] and the Sherway Gardens store on September 15, 2017.[75] The Yorkdale store was confirmed on April 8, 2013,[76] and opened on October 21, 2016.[77] The Toronto Eaton Centre was the last of the six stores to be announced on January 15, 2014,[78] however, it was the fourth to open on September 18, 2016.[79]\n\nThe first Nordstrom Rack opened at Vaughan Mills on March 21, 2018; and then a second location in Deerfoot Meadows in Calgary and a flagship location at One Bloor in Toronto opened on May 3, 2018.[80] Nordstrom Rack opened three other additional stores in Fall 2018; one at Heartland Town Centre in Mississauga, one at Ottawa Trainyards, and finally one at South Edmonton Commons.\n\nOn March 2, 2023, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing all their Canadian stores, which would entail 2,500 staff losing their jobs. The company stated, \"Despite our best efforts, we do not see a realistic path to profitability for the Canadian business.\"[81] The closing will be done under court supervision within the framework of the Canadian Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA), with the help of a third-party liquidator.[82] Liquidation sales began for all locations on March 21, 2023. All Canadian Nordstrom Rack locations closed on May 14, 2023,[83] while all Canadian full-line stores closed on June 13, 2023.\n\nRetail formats\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of May 2022 , there are 100 full-line Nordstrom department stores,[84] which average 140,000 square feet (13,000 m2).[85]\n\nNordstrom holds six annual sales. Two of these are Half-Yearly sales, which take place semi-annually in May and late December, as well as three additional seasonal sales. Nordstrom's largest sale event is the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, which is held each July.[86] Limited amounts of merchandise set to be released for the following fall are sent to Nordstrom stores early, where they are sold at discount. For ten days prior to Anniversary Sale, Nordstrom gives early access to members who make appointments.[87]\n\nNordstrom Local\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom Local service hubs are oriented for amenities including online order pickup, personal styling, and tailoring. They do not have their own inventory, and instead source merchandise from full-line stores as needed. As of May 2022 , there are seven Nordstrom Local locations between New York City and Los Angeles,[84] which average 3,000 square feet (280 m2).[85]\n\nRestaurants\n\n[edit]\n\nFast casual and full-service restaurants operate within most Nordstrom full-line stores.[88]\n\nList of Nordstrom restaurants[89] Restaurant Concept type Year\n\ndebuted Notes Bar Verde 2013 Bistro Verde Bazille Broadway Bar Bar Located within New York City flagship store Burger Bar American 2022 Located within New York City flagship store Cafe Bistro Cafe Nordstrom Classic Cafe 1980 Rebranded as Marketplace Cafe in 1998 Ebar Coffeehouse Gelato Bar 2016 Located in Ala Moana Center store Habitant Bar 2013 Hani Pacific Hawaiian 2019 Previously located within New York City flagship store Jeannie's Pizza 2019 Marketplace Cafe Comfort food 1998 Rebranded from Classic Cafe Milk Bar Bakery 2019 Located in New York City men's store Nordstrom Grill American NYC Clubhouse Bar Located in New York City men's store Oh Mochi Mochi donuts Ruscello Mediterranean Shoe Bar Bar Sweet Sundae Bar Dessert Wolf Italian 2019 Located within New York City flagship store\n\nNordstrom Rack\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Nordstrom Rack\n\nNordstrom Rack originated as a bargain basement in the downtown Seattle flagship store in 1973.

      "# [Nordstrom Reports Second Quarter 2024 Earnings on 2024-08-27](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nordstrom-reports-second-quarter-2024-earnings-302232005.html)\nSales positive across both banners and digital during second quarter\n\nReports EPS of $0.72, adjusted EPS of $0.961\n\nUpdates fiscal 2024 outlook\n\nSEATTLE, Aug. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today reported second quarter net earnings of $122 million, or earnings per diluted share (\"EPS\") of $0.72, and earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\") of $190 million. Excluding a charge primarily related to supply chain asset impairment, the Company reported adjusted EBIT of $244 million and adjusted EPS of $0.96.1\n\nFor the second quarter ended August 3, 2024, net sales increased 3.4 percent versus the same period in fiscal 2023, and total Company comparable sales increased 1.9 percent. Gross merchandise value (\"GMV\") increased 3.5 percent. Anniversary Sale timing, with one week shifting from the third quarter to the second quarter, had a positive impact of approximately 100 basis points on net sales compared with 2023. During the quarter, Nordstrom banner net sales and comparable sales each increased 0.9 percent. Net sales for Nordstrom Rack increased 8.8 percent and comparable sales increased 4.1 percent.\n\n\"Our second quarter results were solid, and we're encouraged by the continued topline strength in both banners and the progress we're making to expand gross margin and increase profitability,\" said Erik Nordstrom, chief executive officer of Nordstrom, Inc. \"We're confident in our outlook for the remainder of the year and look forward to sustaining the momentum we've built as we execute on our 2024 priorities.\"\n\nIn the second quarter, active, women's apparel, beauty and kids had the strongest growth versus 2023. During the Anniversary Sale, including one day that fell in the third quarter, the top growing categories were beauty, active and home.\n\n\"We're pleased with the Anniversary Sale and the enthusiastic response from our loyal customers. They were highly engaged throughout the event and responded favorably to our assortment, experiences and service,\" said Pete Nordstrom, president of Nordstrom, Inc. \"We appreciate our team's continued efforts to help our customers feel good and look their best.\"\n\nAs previously announced, on August 21, 2024, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share, payable on September 18, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 3, 2024.\n\nSECOND QUARTER 2024 SUMMARY\n\nTotal Company net sales increased 3.4 percent and comparable sales increased 1.9 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2023. GMV increased 3.5 percent. The timing shift of the Anniversary Sale, with one day falling in the third quarter of 2024 versus eight days in 2023, had a positive impact on net sales of approximately 100 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNordstrom banner net sales and comparable sales each increased 0.9 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2023. GMV increased 1.1 percent. The timing shift of the Anniversary Sale had a positive impact on Nordstrom banner net sales of approximately 200 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNordstrom Rack banner net sales increased 8.8 percent and comparable sales increased 4.1 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2023.\n\nDigital sales increased 6.2 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2023. The timing shift of the Anniversary Sale had a positive impact on Company digital sales of approximately 100 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2023. Digital sales represented 37 percent of total sales during the quarter.\n\nGross profit, as a percentage of net sales, of 36.6 percent increased 155 basis points compared with the same period in fiscal 2023, primarily due to strong regular price sales and leverage on higher total sales.\n\nEnding inventory increased 8.3 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2023, versus a 3.4 percent increase in sales.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses, as a percentage of net sales, of 34.4 percent increased 160 basis points compared with the same period in fiscal 2023, due to a charge primarily related to supply chain asset impairment and a 2023 gain on the sale of a real estate asset, partially offset by leverage on higher sales. Excluding the $54 million charge primarily related to supply chain asset impairment, adjusted SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 33.0 percent.\n\nEBIT was $190 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared with $192 million during the same period in fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBIT of $244 million excluded the charge primarily related to supply chain asset impairment.2\n\nInterest expense, net, of $26 million was flat compared with $26 million during the same period in fiscal 2023.\n\nIncome tax expense was $42 million, or 25.7 percent of pretax earnings, compared with income tax expense of $29 million, or 17.2 percent of pretax earnings, in the same period in fiscal 2023. The increase in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was driven primarily by the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nThe Company ended the second quarter with $1.5 billion in available liquidity, including $679 million in cash.\n\nSTORES UPDATE\n\nTo date in fiscal 2024, the Company has opened eleven stores:\n\nThe Company has also announced plans to open the following stores:\n\nThe Company had the following store counts as of quarter-end:\n\nFISCAL YEAR 2024 OUTLOOK\n\nThe Company updated its financial outlook for fiscal 2024, which also now reflects the charge primarily related to supply chain asset impairment and related tax impacts recorded in the second quarter, as well as estimated accelerated technology depreciation impacts expected in the second half of fiscal 2024:\n\nRevenue range, including retail sales and credit card revenues, of 1.0 percent decline to 1.0 percent growth versus the 53-week fiscal 2023, which includes an approximately 135 basis point unfavorable impact from the 53rd week\n\nComparable sales range of flat to 2.0 percent growth versus 52 weeks in fiscal 2023\n\nEBIT margin of 3.0 to 3.4 percent of sales\n\nAdjusted EBIT margin of 3.6 to 4.0 percent of sales3\n\nIncome tax rate of approximately 27 percent\n\nEPS of $1.40 to $1.70, excluding the impact of share repurchase activity, if any\n\nAdjusted EPS of $1.75 to $2.05, excluding the impact of share repurchase activity, if any3\n\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\n\nThe Company's senior management will host a conference call to provide a business update and to discuss second quarter 2024 financial results and fiscal 2024 outlook at 4:45 p.m. EDT today.

(NYSE: JWN) today reported fourth quarter net earnings of $134 million, or $0.82 per diluted share (\"EPS\"), for the 14-week quarter ended February 3, 2024. Excluding a supply chain asset impairment and related charge, the Company reported adjusted EPS of $0.96.1\n\nFor the 53-week fiscal year ended February 3, 2024, net earnings were $134 million and diluted EPS was $0.82, with earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\") of $251 million, or 1.8 percent of sales. Excluding charges related to the wind-down of Canadian operations reported in the first and third quarters and a supply chain asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter, adjusted EBIT was $567 million, or 4.0 percent of sales, and adjusted EPS was $2.12 for fiscal 2023.1\n\nFor the fourth quarter, total Company net sales increased 2.2 percent versus the same period in fiscal 2022, inclusive of approximately $190 million related to the 53rd week, and gross merchandise value (\"GMV\") increased 2.0 percent. Nordstrom banner net sales decreased 3.0 percent and GMV decreased 3.4 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. Net sales for Nordstrom Rack increased 14.6 percent.\n\n\"We delivered on our 2023 guidance and are confident in our expectations for continued sales improvement and sustained profitability in 2024,\" said Erik Nordstrom, chief executive officer of Nordstrom, Inc. \"We're laser-focused on efforts we know will drive growth and profitability across the business over the next few years, including new Rack store openings, Nordstrom digital growth and increasing comp store sales. We have a strong team dedicated to building on our heritage of service, and we look forward to helping our customers feel good and look their best in the year ahead.\"\n\nIn the fourth quarter, active, beauty and women's apparel had the strongest growth versus 2022. For fiscal 2023, active and beauty had the strongest growth versus 2022.\n\n\"In 2023, we continued to make progress against the priorities we identified at the outset of the year to improve the customer experience and drive better financial results. Across both banners, we improved our merchandise assortment by effectively managing our inventory levels and investing in the products and brands we know our customers respond to,\" said Pete Nordstrom, president of Nordstrom, Inc. \"This year, we'll build on that progress in merchandising and other green shoots across our business as we focus our efforts on our refreshed 2024 priorities.\"\n\nAs previously announced on February 28, 2024, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share to be paid to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 12, 2024, payable on March 27, 2024.\n\nFOURTH QUARTER 2023 SUMMARY\n\nTotal Company net sales in the fourth quarter increased 2.2 percent, inclusive of 460 basis points related to the 53rd week, compared with the same period in fiscal 2022. The wind-down of Canadian operations had a negative impact on total Company fourth quarter net sales of 250 basis points. GMV increased 2.0 percent in the fourth quarter and decreased 6.1 percent in fiscal 2023 when compared with the same periods in 2022. Full-year revenue for fiscal 2023, including retail sales and credit card revenues, decreased 5.4 percent.\n\nNordstrom banner net sales in the fourth quarter decreased 3.0 percent, inclusive of 410 basis points related to the 53rd week, compared with the same period in fiscal 2022, improving sequentially from the third quarter. The wind-down of Canadian operations had a negative impact on Nordstrom banner fourth quarter net sales of 355 basis points. GMV decreased 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter and decreased 8.5 percent in fiscal 2023 when compared with the same periods in 2022.\n\nNordstrom Rack banner net sales in the fourth quarter increased 14.6 percent, inclusive of 580 basis points related to the 53rd week, compared with the same period in fiscal 2022, improving sequentially from the third quarter.\n\nDigital sales in the fourth quarter decreased 1.7 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2022. Digital sales represented 38 percent of total sales during the quarter and 36 percent of sales for the fiscal year.\n\nGross profit, as a percentage of net sales, of 34.4 percent increased 125 basis points compared with the same period in fiscal 2022 due to lower markdowns, lower buying and occupancy costs and leverage on higher sales.\n\nEnding inventory decreased 2.7 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2022, versus a 2.2 percent increase in sales.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses, as a percentage of net sales, of 32.4 percent increased 85 basis points compared with the same period in fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher labor costs and a supply chain asset impairment charge, partially offset by improvements in variable costs from supply chain efficiencies and leverage on higher sales. Excluding the $32 million supply chain asset impairment and related charge, adjusted SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 31.6 percent.\n\nEBIT was $215 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with $187 million during the same period in fiscal 2022. Adjusted EBIT of $247 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 excluded a supply chain asset impairment charge. EBIT was $251 million for fiscal 2023, and adjusted EBIT of $567 million excluded charges related to the wind-down of Canadian operations reported in the first and third quarters and a supply chain asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter. EBIT margin and adjusted EBIT margin for the quarter were 5.0 percent and 5.7 percent of sales, respectively. EBIT margin and adjusted EBIT margin for the fiscal year were 1.8 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively.2\n\nInterest expense, net, of $26 million decreased from $27 million during the same period in fiscal 2022.\n\nIncome tax expense during the fourth quarter was $55 million, or 29.1 percent of pretax earnings, compared with $41 million, or 25.2 percent of pretax earnings, in the same period of fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to unfavorable provision-to-return adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with the same quarter in fiscal 2022. The full-year income tax rate was 8.6 percent. Excluding a 1,640 basis point combined favorable impact from the one-time Canada charges and the supply chain asset impairment charge, the full-year income tax rate would be 25.0 percent.\n\nThe Company ended the year with $1.4 billion in available liquidity, including $628 million in cash.\n\nSTORES UPDATE\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company opened or relocated 20 stores:\n\nThe Company has also announced plans to open the following stores:\n\nThe Company had the following store counts as of quarter-end:\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company closed one ASOS | Nordstrom store and one Nordstrom Rack store.\n\nFISCAL YEAR 2024 OUTLOOK\n\nThe Company expects fiscal 2024 to be a year of continued momentum in its growth and profitability drivers, including opening new Rack stores, growing Nordstrom banner digital sales and driving comparable store sales across both banners. As such, the Company is providing the following financial outlook for fiscal 2024:\n\nRevenue range, including retail sales and credit card revenues, of 2.0 percent decline to 1.0 percent growth versus the 53-week fiscal 2023, which includes an approximately 135 basis point unfavorable impact from the 53rd week\n\nComparable sales range of 1.0 percent decline to 2.0 percent growth versus 52 weeks in fiscal 20233\n\nEBIT margin of 3.5 to 4.0 percent of sales\n\nIncome tax rate of approximately 27 percent\n\nEPS of $1.65 to $2.05, excluding the impact of share repurchase activity, if any\n\nThe 53rd week in fiscal 2023 creates a timing shift in the 4-5-4 calendar for fiscal 2024 that is expected to impact comparisons to the prior year.\n\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\n\nThe Company's senior management will host a conference call to provide a business update and to discuss fourth quarter 2023 financial results and fiscal year 2024 outlook at 4:45 p.m. EST today.

      "# [Nordstrom family may try again to take the company private by Daphne Howland on 2024-04-19](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstrom-family-may-try-again-to-take-the-company-private/713679/)\nDive Brief:\n\nNordstrom‚Äôs board of directors has formed a special committee of ‚Äúindependent and disinterested directors‚Äù to ‚Äúcarefully evaluate any proposal from Erik and Pete Nordstrom and any proposals from other parties and consider whether they are in the best interests of Nordstrom and all shareholders,‚Äù per a company press release.\n\nThe Nordstrom brothers had notified the board in February of their interest in ‚Äúpotential equity financing for a ‚Äògoing private transaction,‚Äô‚Äù according to a Thursday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nErik Nordstrom, who is CEO, owns 7.45% of the company‚Äôs outstanding shares; Pete Nordstrom, who is president and chief brand officer, owns 7.41%; and other family members also own shares.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nDespite its reputation for stellar customer service, innovation and appealing assortments, Nordstrom hasn‚Äôt escaped the troubles that many department stores find themselves in ‚Äî losing sales and ceding market share.\n\nThe retailer in recent years has shrunk its full-line fleet, exiting Canada entirely and opting to shutter 16 stores permanently during the height of the pandemic. In the meantime, it has greatly expanded its off-price Rack business, which many analysts see as volatile and lagging behind stalwarts like TJX and Ross.\n\n‚ÄúIt is no secret that over the past few years Nordstrom has struggled,‚Äù GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments. ‚ÄúAgainst this backdrop, the company value has shrunk, and Nordstrom has come under more pressure from investors. This will have caused pain to the founding family, many of whom still run the company, and seems to have rekindled their desire to take the chain private where they can operate away from the daily scrutiny of markets.‚Äù\n\nThe family attempted that six years ago, but its offer of $50 per share was rejected by the board as inadequate. At press time, shares are trading for less than $19. Still, it could be difficult to raise the necessary capital given today‚Äôs tight market, according to Saunders.\n\nMacy‚Äôs recent troubles may also be on the Nordstroms‚Äô minds. That department store has been forced to reckon with investors agitating to unlock value from its real estate, who have offered $6.6 billion to take that department store over. Activist investors swooping onto Nordstrom in a similar fashion ‚Äúwould be an anathema to [the Nordstroms‚Äô] general ethos of doing business and by taking the company private they can safeguard its legacy,‚Äù Saunders said.\n\nErik and Pete‚Äôs great-grandfather, John W. Nordstrom, launched the business as a shoe store in Seattle in 1901. The company went public in 1971, with ‚ÄúJWN‚Äù as its stock ticker. Bringing the company back to firmer family control and out of the public markets could give Nordstrom the breathing room it needs to turn the business around, though taking on too much debt could hamper that, too, Saunders warned.\n\nReports that the Nordstrom family might want to take the company private surfaced last month, though the company at the time said it wouldn‚Äôt comment on rumors or market speculation.\n\nThe Nordstroms revealed their intentions while the board was evaluating various possible strategic alternatives that could enhance shareholder value, according to the company‚Äôs press release Thursday. The board‚Äôs new special committee has hired Morgan Stanley & Co. and Centerview Partners as financial advisors, and Sidley Austin and Perkins Coie as legal counsel.",

Last year, digital accounted for 36 percent, or about $5 billion, of ‚Äôs total sales of $14.22 billion.\n\nFor now at least, Nordstrom is easing into its new marketplace format by not rushing to bring in a great many new brands right away. However, executives said they do expect to grow their online product assortment by two to three times in the next few years while keeping their online channels curated, customer-centric and service-oriented. The marketplace went live Monday.\n\nAmong the key brands available on the marketplace and new to Nordstrom are Dippin‚Äô Daisy‚Äôs, a fast-growing swimwear brand; Maison de Sabre luxury leather goods, and Tracksmith, the running brand.\n\nAmong other brands joining Nordstrom via the marketplace are Adore Me, Alala, Ana Luisa, Cynthia Rowley, Derek Lam 10 Crosby, Deux Par Deux, Dia & Co., DXL, La DoubleJ, Natori and Onia.\n\n‚ÄúThe sellers and brands on our marketplace will have the exact same threshold of quality and relevance to our customers as any other brand we do business with. There‚Äôs a very high bar for the products we choose to present to our customer base. Nothing changes. We are not going to become ‚Äòthe everything store,'‚Äù Miguel Almeida, president of Nordstrom digital and customer experience, told WWD in an interview.\n\nAmplifying Categories\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about extending our ability to find incredible brands we believe our customers will love and introducing them to those brands at a bigger scale, without the cost of a wholesale model,‚Äù Almeida added. ‚ÄúThe marketplace also allows us to offer the full expression of the top brands we already have.‚Äù\n\nAsked what categories not currently sold by Nordstrom could be or are being introduced to the online marketplace, Almeida replied: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not necessarily a category extension strategy. It‚Äôs more about amplifying the categories that we have and serving customers better in those categories.‚Äù Still, he did single out marketplace opportunities to ‚Äúlean‚Äù into the gifting, home and outdoor categories; accelerate growth with brands targeting younger customers, and offer extended sizes and a wider range of prices.\n\n‚ÄúOur marketplace will feel very, very connected with what Nordstrom is known for. It just allows us more flexibility and agility,‚Äù Almeida said. ‚ÄúWe can also be much more intentional about serving customers better in different locations.‚Äù\n\nNordstrom isn‚Äôt aggressively seeking out brands to introduce to its new digital marketplace. As Almeida said, ‚ÄúWe want to make sure that everything goes right before we scale and expand too fast. It‚Äôs fully live, but the marketplace is not going to have all of that significant growth in Day One, to ensure that everything is fully buttoned up as we present this new offering to customers.‚Äù\n\nNordstrom has partnered with Mirakl and its platform which allows brands to set up their assortments on retailers‚Äô websites. ‚ÄúWe see Mirakl as the industry leading solution and they have given us the ability to eventually co-innovate with them in this space,‚Äù Almeida said.\n\nHe emphasized that with its marketplace, the Seattle-based Nordstrom will maintain its reputation for service. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll handle customer care directly with the customer, which most marketplace models from other retailers don‚Äôt do,‚Äù Almeida said. ‚ÄúWhen there is customer care issue, they put the customer in contact with the seller directly, bypassing their own customer care team. But we are handling our own care with customers, and then we deal with the brands separately. The customer will continue interfacing with us and the people here they‚Äôve known. We are honoring our legacy of service and trust, saying, ‚Äòif you have any questions, let us know.'‚Äù\n\nA customer seeking to return an item bought on the marketplace can return it to a Nordstrom store, and get the refund quicker rather than shipping it back to the seller and waiting days for the refund. ‚ÄúWe will refund the customer directly and take the product just like it was any other product that we‚Äôre serving through wholesale,‚Äù said Almeida.\n\nMarketplace to Brick-and-mortar\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also a very deliberate connection between marketplace and our stores,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúOur stylists have access to style boards and will be able to complement their styling consultations with broader assortments than what they have in the stores. We can also set up alterations for products bought on the marketplace. There‚Äôs a service integration.‚Äù\n\nWith the marketplace, Nordstrom can jump on emerging trends faster. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a much easier process for brands to start selling with us,‚Äù compared to the traditional wholesale model, Almeida said, adding that with the marketplace model, it can take less than 30 days from identifying a trend to placing the relevant items on the site.\n\nSome marketplace items could wind up being sold in Nordstrom stores as well. ‚ÄúThe idea is to be agile in showing customers relevant products and brands that we believe they will love,‚Äù Almeida said. ‚ÄúAs soon as we see that traction, our merchandising teams are informed in terms of what they would want to buy and put in stores. Absolutely, this is a way for some brands to show up in our stores.‚Äù\n\nWith the marketplace model, brands manage the merchandise content, pricing and shipping, while Nordstrom can affect the look of how products are presented. Nordstrom receives a commission when a listed item is sold on the marketplace. Commissions are generally standard, with minimal variation if at all, from brand to brand, Almeida said.\n\nWith the wholesale model, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have unlimited dollars. Our merchants have to make very hard choices around the breadth and depth of brands we sell to make the economics of our business work. Marketplace allows us to break free from those economics,‚Äù explained Almeida, who along with his team is responsible for Nordstrom.com, Nordstromrack.com and the customer experience strategy across both online and in stores. Prior to Nordstrom, he led Starbucks‚Äôs digital team and the design, product management and technology of the Starbucks mobile app. Earlier, he was the executive vice president of digital at Lululemon Athletica, and held leadership roles at Walgreens Boots Alliance, Apple, Dell and the Boston Consulting Group.\n\nWith the marketplace format, retailers do not own the merchandise or manage the shipping to customers, which is different from wholesaling where retailers own the merchandise bought by their merchants, hold it in their warehouses and stores, and deliver it to customers. It‚Äôs also different from drop shipping where a retailer would own the goods being sold online but they‚Äôre shipped by the supplier.\n\nRisks and Reputation\n\nRetailers make less money on each item purchased on a marketplace, since products are listed, not owned, and sold on commission. There is less financial risk and potentially, retailers could make up what they lose in margin by generating greater volume with the larger marketplace assortment. There are other kinds of risks, however. Brands sometimes find themselves near other brands of inferior quality, affecting perceptions. Brands also risk cannibalizing their sales on one marketplace from another. In addition, if a consumer orders from a marketplace and is disappointed by a poor shipping experience (it arrives late or the wrong product is delivered) the marketplace might be blamed and its reputation suffer, even though it could be the fault of the brand handling the shipping.\n\nGiant digital marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Alibaba, Farfetch and Shopify list a vast array of categories and items. Some are characterized as ‚Äúgeneralists,‚Äù meaning they offer everything to everybody without having a sharp identity or clear image ‚Äî something Nordstrom promises to avoid. In the last few years, a fast-growing subset of smaller retail marketplaces has emerged including Macy‚Äôs, Bloomingdale‚Äôs, Hudson‚Äôs Bay, Best Buy, Stadium Goods, Lands‚Äô End, Crate & Barrel, and Urban Outfitters.\n\n‚ÄúOur vision is to become the Spotify of fashion, and that means receiving signals from customers on what they want from us and showing them our expanding extended assortment in a way that is unique to them,‚Äù Almeida said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre putting significant effort on evolving the experience of our and our mobile app. We‚Äôre going to infuse (both) with more inspirational content. We‚Äôre going to make that discovery experience a lot more exciting with a much broader assortment that comes to life through the marketplace.‚Äù\n\nAsked if a marketplace could also be developed for the Nordstrom Rack off-price division, Almeida said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not launching with Rack but it could in the future apply to Rack.‚Äù",

It already owns approximately 9.6% of Nordstrom stock.\n\nThe offer represents a premium of nearly 35% to Nordstrom‚Äôs stock since March 18 when media reports about the proposed transaction first emerged, shares have rallied this year and traded for just above $23 on Wednesday.\n\n‚ÄúThat the Nordstrom family have made an offer to buy the department store chain comes as no surprise. What is interesting is the $23 a share value which is pretty much the current price of the stock, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData. ‚ÄúThe lack of any real premium would, under normal circumstances, make the offer unattractive. However, as a family-run firm the dynamics are slightly different, and it will be up to an independent committee to determine whether this is in the best interests of the company and its investors.‚Äù\n\nNordstrom last month reported sales growth of 3.4% in the second quarter, as sales in stores open at least a year ‚Äî a key metric of a retailer‚Äôs health ‚Äî rose 1.9%. But net income slipped nearly 11% to $122 million. Adjusted earnings per share totaled 96 cents, and overall results beat analyst estimates. Besides its namesake upscale stores, the company also operates discount Nordstrom Rack stores, which have become a strength.\n\nSales at Nordstrom Rack jumped 8.8% in the most recent quarter and its comparable sales rose 4.1%.\n\n‚ÄúThe offer comes at a time when Nordstrom is getting back on track after a long period of poor performance,‚Äù Saunders said. ‚ÄúHowever, the business remains one of two halves. The department store division has various structural challenges, while the off-price Rack division is starting to produce some good growth. This mixed outlook will limit the amount any party is willing to pay.‚Äù\n\nErik B. and Peter E. Nordstrom are the fourth-generation leaders of the retailer, which was founded in 1901 as a shoe store. Erik is the company‚Äôs chief executive and Peter is president.

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on Nordstrom, Inc.\n\n## Company Overview\n\nNordstrom, Inc. is an American luxury department store chain headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Founded in 1901 by John W. Nordstrom and Carl F. Wallin, the company initially operated as a shoe store and has since evolved into a full-line retailer, offering a wide range of clothing, accessories, and home goods. As of October 2023, Nordstrom operates approximately 360 stores across the United States, including its off-price division, Nordstrom Rack [(Wikipedia, 2003-04-22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Financial Performance\n\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2024, Nordstrom reported net earnings of $122 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, with a 3.4% increase in net sales compared to the same period in fiscal 2023. Notably, Nordstrom Rack saw an 8.8% increase in net sales, indicating strong performance in the off-price segment [(PR Newswire, 2024-08-27)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nordstrom-reports-second-quarter-2024-earnings-302232005.html).

The annual Anniversary Sale, which features significant discounts on popular brands, is a key event for the company, drawing considerable customer engagement [(Hollywood Reporter, 2024-08-01)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/shopping/nordstrom-anniversary-sale-date-early-access-deals-1234975177/).\n\n### Nordstrom Rack\n\nNordstrom Rack serves as the company's off-price retail division, offering discounted merchandise from Nordstrom's full-line stores. As of May 2022, there are 249 Nordstrom Rack locations, and the division has been a significant growth driver for the company, with sales increasing by 14.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 [(Digital Commerce 360, 2024-03-06)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/03/06/nordstrom-rack-outpaces-parent-company-total-sales-growth-q4-2023/).\n\n## Executive Leadership\n\nErik Nordstrom serves as the CEO, while Pete Nordstrom holds the position of President and Chief Brand Officer. Both are fourth-generation members of the Nordstrom family and have been instrumental in navigating the company through recent challenges, including the expansion of the Nordstrom Rack division and the launch of the digital marketplace [(Retail Dive, 2024-04-19)](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstrom-family-may-try-again-to-take-the-company-private/713679/).\n\n## Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions\n\nIn 2011, Nordstrom acquired HauteLook, an online retailer specializing in flash sales, for $180 million. This acquisition has helped bolster Nordstrom's online presence and customer engagement [(Wikipedia, 2003-04-22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom). Additionally, the company has formed partnerships with various brands to enhance its product offerings, including a recent agreement with 11 Honor√© to sell plus-sized designer fashion [(PR Newswire, 2024-03-05)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nordstrom-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-earnings-302080324.html).\n\n## Challenges and Market Position\n\nDespite its strong brand identity and customer loyalty, Nordstrom faces challenges common in the retail sector, including competition from off-price retailers like TJX Companies and Ross Stores. The company's decision to exit the Canadian market in 2023 and close several underperforming stores reflects ongoing efforts to streamline operations and focus on profitable segments [(Wikipedia, 2003-04-22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNordstrom, Inc. continues to adapt to the evolving retail landscape by expanding its digital presence and focusing on its off-price division, Nordstrom Rack. The recent interest from the Nordstrom family to take the company private may provide the necessary flexibility to navigate current market challenges. As the company moves forward, its ability to enhance customer experience and maintain a curated product assortment will be critical to its success.\n\n---\n\nThis report is intended for prospective candidates and investors seeking a comprehensive understanding of Nordstrom, Inc. and its product offerings.
