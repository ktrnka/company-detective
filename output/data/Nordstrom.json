  "summary_markdown": "# About Nordstrom\n\nNordstrom, Inc. is a prominent American luxury department store chain headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The company was founded in 1901 by John W. Nordstrom and Carl F. Wallin, initially as a shoe store. Over the years, Nordstrom expanded its offerings to include clothing in 1963 and became a full-line retailer by 1971, competing with other high-end department stores like Bloomingdale's and Neiman Marcus [(Wikipedia, 2003-04-22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom).\n\nNordstrom operates several retail formats, including full-line department stores, Nordstrom Rack (an off-price division), and Nordstrom Local (smaller service hubs). As of May 2022, the company operated 100 full-line department stores and 249 Nordstrom Rack locations [(Wikipedia, 2003-04-22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom). The company generates revenue through the sale of luxury goods, apparel, accessories, and beauty products, catering to fashion-conscious individuals and families. In the fiscal year ending February 3, 2024, Nordstrom reported total sales of $14.22 billion [(Duckett et al., Digital Commerce 360, 2024-12-27)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/12/27/nordstrom-family-strikes-deal-to-take-company-private/).\n\nNordstrom's products are distributed through its physical stores and online platform, with digital sales accounting for 36% of total sales in 2024 [(Duckett et al., Digital Commerce 360, 2024-12-27)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/12/27/nordstrom-family-strikes-deal-to-take-company-private/). The company is known for its commitment to customer service, offering services such as personal styling, alterations, and online shopping with in-store pickup options.\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nErik Nordstrom serves as the CEO of Nordstrom, while his brother Pete Nordstrom is the president and chief brand officer. The leadership team is focused on enhancing customer experience and adapting to the evolving retail landscape [(Duckett et al., Digital Commerce 360, 2024-12-27)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/12/27/nordstrom-family-strikes-deal-to-take-company-private/). Following the passing of Blake Nordstrom in January 2019, the leadership structure has shifted to include more family members in key roles [(Wikipedia, 2003-04-22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom).\n\n# News\n\n## Acquisition and Going Private\n\nOn December 23, 2024, Nordstrom announced plans to be acquired and taken private in a deal valued at $6.25 billion. The transaction involves the Nordstrom family and Mexican retail conglomerate El Puerto de Liverpool, with the family retaining a 50.1% stake and Liverpool holding 49.9% [(Howland, Retail Dive, 2024-12-23)](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstroms-puerto-liverpool-company-private-625b/736220/). Erik Nordstrom described this as an \"exciting new chapter\" for the company. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory approval [(Frey, ABC 6 News, 2024-12-24)](https://www.kaaltv.com/news/department-store-nordstrom-agrees-to-be-acquired-and-taken-private/).\n\n## Financial Performance\n\nNordstrom's financial performance has seen some challenges, with total sales declining from $15.08 billion in 2022 to $14.22 billion in 2024. However, the company has experienced growth in digital sales, which increased by 6.4% in Q3 FY24, contributing to a total of $3.35 billion in net sales for that quarter [(Singsit, Just-Style, 2024-11-29)](https://www.just-style.com/news/nordstrom-q3-fy24-earnings/).\n\n## Challenges and Future Outlook\n\nNordstrom has faced challenges in maintaining profitability and adapting to the competitive retail environment. The decision to go private is seen as a strategic move to focus on long-term growth without the pressures of public market scrutiny [(Clark, WWD, 2024-12-19)](https://wwd.com/business-news/financial/nordstrom-family-liverpool-deal-nears-1236772463/). Analysts suggest that while Nordstrom is not the worst performer in its sector, it has not met its own past standards in merchandising and operations [(Howland, Retail Dive, 2024-12-23)](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstroms-puerto-liverpool-company-private-625b/736220/).\n\nIn summary, Nordstrom is navigating a complex retail landscape with a focus on digital growth and customer experience, while also preparing for a significant transition to private ownership. This strategic shift may provide the flexibility needed to innovate and adapt in a rapidly changing market.",

      "# Post ID do8kat: Nordstrom Rack questions with +20 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/)\nI absolutely LOVE shopping at Nordstrom’s, but unfortunately my city doesn’t have one only a Nordstrom rack. I was wondering if the clothes and Nordstrom Rack were the same quality as Nordstrom or does the designers make a cheaper brand for the Rack. I desperately need some jeans and can’t justify spending $130.00 on then knowing they will just rip in the knee 6 months from now. I also seek Nordstrom Rack carries cute spank cheaper than Nordstrom.\n\n## Comment ID f5kq6tz with +108 score by [(blueberrymuffinn, Reddit, 2019-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5kq6tz/) (in reply to ID do8kat):\nThey have some pieces that come from Nordstrom, but from my experience, the majority of items are made specifically for Nordstrom Rack. You can tell if there are a bunch of the same items, they’re made for Rack. The Nordstrom pieces usually only have a few left. There’s a pretty big difference in quality IMO.\n\n### Comment ID f5kulom with +11 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5kulom/) (in reply to ID f5kq6tz):\nThis is what I was worried about. I’m in desperate need of jeans and can’t justify paying $130.00 for madewell since my jeans always split at the knees no matter the price. I have two young boys so I’m constantly bending over or squatting down to them.\n\n#### Comment ID f5kz77g with +56 score by [(Readonlygirl, Reddit, 2019-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5kz77g/) (in reply to ID f5kulom):\nI would hit the thrift stores and buy some 80s mom jeans literally.  They have that nice thick 80s cotton.  Look for made in then USA.  Even up to 90s Ralph Lauren, Levi’s, Calvin Klein, Levi’s, Gloria Vanderbilt will be sturdy. \n\nBecause new dark washes are going to fade in the knees and look bad.  Distressed are going to wear out in the knees. Or just do the ripped look and buy them ripped.  That’s popular with a lot of people right now.\n\nAt minimum start wearing your thrift store jeans when you’re in the house with the kids.\n\n#### Comment ID f5kvm61 with +16 score by [(clittle24, Reddit, 2019-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5kvm61/) (in reply to ID f5kulom):\nI had the same problem with madewell!

I’m pretty sure brands like Madewell and Topshop and Reformation don’t make clothes for NR specifically, so there’s a good chance those are the real quality. However, it’s kind of difficult to find garments from those brands that aren’t....kind of ugly. The reason they’re usually found at NR is because they were unpopular and didn’t sell. Not to say I haven’t found some good pieces, but I’m usually more disappointed than anything.\n\n### Comment ID f5md5yi with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5md5yi/) (in reply to ID f5lq5cg):\nI was wondering if they were unpopular or didn’t sell.

They don’t ever seem to have a big enough range in the store to suggest so, it’s almost always a very small selection of what seem like leftovers. It also wouldn’t really be their brand to do that. It’s usually because they didn’t sell, but the good stuff I’ve found has been out of season. Like, I found a nice topshop sweater during summer. It’s really just a crapshoot. If it were me, I’d say it’s worth giving a try and just returning if need be.\n\n## Comment ID f5mghuk with +3 score by [(DConstructed, Reddit, 2019-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5mghuk/) (in reply to ID do8kat):\nNR useds to be amazing but it's be diluted so much via expansion as well as fighting for merchandise with places like TJMaxx that you usually aren't finding designer stuff anymore.

And my mother loved places like Lohmann's when she was younger.   Found a dream pair of Cole Haan shoes at the Rack.\n\nBack then there were only a few stores and they got the merchandise that didn't sell off in the department stores when the seasons changed or actual designer samples and seconds.\n\nNow not only are manufacturers being very, very careful about overage so they have fewer leftover pieces but more designers are handling their own sample sales AND places like Nordstrom's Rack turned into a pretty big chain.\n\nThey don't have enough \"real\" pieces so they get things made for them.  Since they're still trying to keep the price point low those pieces aren't going to be the same quality as department store or real designer clothes.\n\nI have actually found bras and underwear there that are pretty good a couple of years ago but I have been in recently.  They're not near where I live now.\n\n## Comment ID f5nyuwh with +3 score by [(b2g1, Reddit, 2019-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5nyuwh/) (in reply to ID do8kat):\nBuy 100% cotton jeans.

I work for a fashion brand that's sold in Nordstrom and I can guarantee that anything you find at Rack from us is the real deal.  Building out an entirely different and cheaper manufacturing process just to sell at Rack at a lower cost wouldn't be economically practical for us.  \n\nUsually when I find things at Rack from our brand, it's from the past season, whereas what is found in Nordstrom's is the current season.  For example, we're a denim focused brand, so you'll currently find lots of washes from the summer in Rack right now, whereas Nordstroms is only selling from our fall/winter collection. \n\nI can only speak for my brand, but I imagine it is a similar situation for others as well.\n\n### Comment ID f5xhivq with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5xhivq/) (in reply to ID f5xdpgm):\nThanks you for this information.

There is no Burberry made for Nordstrom Rack that will share the same label.

The quality is usually the same especially in denim. The only thing to be cautious of is the clearance items as they often do have defects like a weird cut or length. I really recommend trying everything on before purchasing. I also don’t recommend Madewell denim as it seems to not be of good quality from my own personal experience.

I worked at Nordstrom a long time ago, and things have greatly changed... but Nordstrom basically created a pick-up department for this.

Nordstrom has always been insanely good about returns. That would have been the only downside as a salesperson, and we would still happily do it for you with a smile.\n\nMan, back in my day, people would be so shameless... $200 new years eve shoes bought New Years Eve and returned New Year's day...

I was a great personal shopper for my guests. I highly recommend Nordstrom if you want real help finding items/don't know what to look for. The customer service is unmatched, and you aren't paying a styling fee or anything. And, you can really wear/try them at home before returning. I got to know my customers really well, and if they were returning something we would try to find something better. I always wanted my folks to look great and come back to me for all their needs.\n\nI loved that job.

I’ve always wanted to do it but the idea of going and then trying on everything the stylist brings and nothing fitting fills me with a middle school level self conscious anxiety\n\n#### Comment ID ku325o8 with +2 score by [(messyarts, Reddit, 2024-03-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/1b9qft1/silly_question_about_shopping_at_nordstrom/ku325o8/) (in reply to ID ku16179):\nHey! This is a great question. We used to do internal transfers from other stores for free all the time… I’m not sure how they have adapted for e-commerce. I don’t think they will do it, only because shipping is free online.\n\nIn this case, I would find a gal that looks similar in proportions that just works there. They should be asking everyone if they need help (how I know things have changed) right when they get there. Just tell them this exactly, there are tons of pieces you want to try and don’t want to order things only to return. And doesn’t have to only be clothes… we are talking makeup, lingerie, shit, home goods! We cross sell, they can take you around the whole store. You don’t need a “stylist” appointment. We were all stylists. If they are good at their job they will blow you away.\n\nI was a solid 31 waist and that was overweight back then… (many things did stop at 30, size 10/12) I would get folks asking me for help for those reasons and I would take them all around the store. I knew which brands ran big and could easily fit me, and which ones didn’t. Esp mothers with young ladies… those were my best days, when we found cute as fuck clothes for a teen who hated shopping. \n\nI would probably just order things from online and return unfortunately. It is kind of the norm now anyway, you just don’t get the great one on one service.\n\n#### Comment ID ku66ul8 with +2 score by [(PlantedinCA, Reddit, 2024-03-10)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/1b9qft1/silly_question_about_shopping_at_nordstrom/ku66ul8/) (in reply to ID ku16179):\nNordstrom [fairly recently started requiring their house brands to extend to 18 or 20](https://press.nordstrom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nordstrom-expands-extended-sizing-30-stores-100-brands/). And they are merchandising brands that have plus and straight - with all their stuff together.  \n\nMy local store carries plus in store (I am more like 18/20) and I found that all of the stores in my area had some. But one store aimed for a younger audience than the other and had way better stuff.  Jeans tend to be well stocked at all stores. But there were some more fun dresses and non-work wear at the other store. \n\nThey do a better job stocking in store than other brands. I’d do a quick shop in store on Nordstrom.com to see what that have in store.\n\n## Comment ID ktxenjf with +15 score by [(WalterBishRedLicrish, Reddit, 2024-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/1b9qft1/silly_question_about_shopping_at_nordstrom/ktxenjf/) (in reply to ID 1b9qft1):\nThis is the way I buy all my clothes. I shop at Nordstrom frequently because I have the credit card and I get points to spend there. For me, I cannot for the life of me figure out if something is flattering,  comfortable, and fits the circumstances in which I would wear it unless I try it on at home. I will wear a garment for half an hour or so to figure it out. Whatever I don't like, or if I need a different size, I return in store. While I'm there I'll purchase items i didn't need to try on. But you can return via mail I think. I acknowledge there is privilege in doing this because I can afford the upfront costs.   \n\nEdit: meant to say that I just order online when I do this.

It's not the miracle I was hoping for- I was imagining someone bringing me whole, interesting outfits including shoes to try on. What actually happened on my first appointment was we communicated by text a few times and I gave her a list of types of things I wanted plus my sizes and some preferred brands.  \n\nWe scheduled an appointment. When I got there she had a huge dressing room set up for me with SO MANY CLOTHES!  Most were variations of what I had requested, with a few unexpected more casual items too. She pretty much just left me to try stuff and came back 2-3 times to see if I needed different sizes, etc. There wasn't any help actually styling outfits but it did save me the time of going through and finding things.\n\nI went mostly to find business formal pieces as I had been WFH for a couple years and my things felt dated. She had a ton of different options of black suits and a bunch of blouses.  It was like looking in my existing closet. She did find a few casual items that I wouldn't have tried on my own but loved.  I ended up spending $500-600 on things. I have since used her 2 more times but only for specific events (I needed a dress for a wedding, etc).\n\nI still recommend trying it as an option- I think a lot depends on the stylist you get. It's free and saves you time. \n\nI had much more success using a stylebox service called FrontDoor Fashion. You can order a box of things to try on and they send you about 10-12 items, put together in actual outfits.  It's much more personalized that something like Stitchfix. The items are more expensive but you have a stylist who is in contact with you v things being picked via an algorithm. It's a $100 deposit but if you keep nothing I believe you get it back.  I've never kept nothing though!  I've gotten great items and it’s how I found my recent interview suit. If you choose to keep the same stylist the boxes really do get better as they learn your style.  My stylist will contact me sometimes randomly and send a pic of an item she thinks I'll like and ask if I want to try it.\n\n### Comment ID ku3p1d8 with +2 score by [(Loveandeggs, Reddit, 2024-03-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/1b9qft1/silly_question_about_shopping_at_nordstrom/ku3p1d8/) (in reply to ID ktxwm1c):\nYeah I haven’t had good luck with the in-store stylist either.   First time I went, I was looking for toppers that weren’t blazers for work, and she had pulled blazers and jean jackets.

I don't live too close (I have 2 good Nordstrom about two hours one way, and 1 middling one about 2 hours in a different direction) to a store, and am usually only regularly around the middling one ~once per month.\n\nIf, however, I had a good enough reason to make a day of it:  I would absolutely go to one or both of the 2 better Nordstrom, in person.  They will likely have stock in store that isn't shown online, personal attention, tailoring, etc.  The experience can just be fun, and relaxing.\n\nI might call to make an appointment with an assistant\\shopper.

Everything is on clearance plus an optional 40% off. If you opt out of the 40% off things are refundable, if you chose to go for the extra 40% off, it’s final sale. The one downside is that fitting rooms are closed so you kind of have to know your size if you want to get the 40% off due to final sale. The first day I waited in line for about two hours. It sucked. I did end up going back the next day with my brother so he could buy some clothes, probably waited about an hour this time. I did see people that came in pairs would have one person wait in line while the other one looked around. I personally thought it was a really good sale. To give you an idea of the sales my mom got a lot of quality clothes, pots etc (21 items total) for $160!!

Lots of bloggers and Insta - Influencers make a big deal about their Nordi semi-annual sale hauls. You can get some amazing deals if you find items you want at Nordstrom, add them to your wishlist on the app or website, or just keep them in your cart and then when the semi-annual sale comes the discounts will be automatically applied. Of course, it really pays to be a rewards member and/or a card holder because you get access to the semi-annual sale earlier than others. The rewards membership is free and all you have to do is enter your phone number anytime you shop to get \"notes\" and they're pretty easy to get and redeem. \n\nPlus, personal preference, but Nordstrom stores are just the nicest. The layout is consistent and its design team just does such a nice job of making sure the space is open, airy, classy, bright and comfortable. I also think Nordstrom has the best options for makeup and fragrance. It is the only one that carries Jo Malone outside of Sephora in the U.S. which is my favorite fragrance brand. \n\nNordstrom just makes the in-person shopping experience feel really nice. They offer a free personal shopping experience which I have never done but would love to do where you go in and you tell them your size and style and they will pull pieces and curate some looks for you and the only thing you pay is what you end up buying. Its those little services that make a difference in my book.\n\n### Comment ID gzghcrz with +6 score by [(loi_, Reddit, 2021-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/gzghcrz/) (in reply to ID gzfnmw0):\nThank you for this!

My old roommates father was a former C-Suite level officer of Nordstrom. While he was visiting the house one weekend Nordstrom had come up and he told a story of how when Nordstorm was expanding, they'd bought a tire store and turned it into a Nordstrom.\n\nA few weeks after opening, a man walked in the front door and rolled a tire over to the main desk. The man went on about how he'd bought the tire from the previous tenant, and could no longer return it because the tire shop no longer existed. \n\nManager asked how much the tires were.

It really must depend on where you’re located. In my experience (though I’m definitely not a major fashion expert, I have lived and shopped in a few different cities) Bloomingdales is equivalent with Macy’s. Nordstrom is a lot better than both. Saks is definitely the most expensive and definitely does have some higher quality items, but you’re going to be paying for it.\n\nI like Nordstrom the best personally. Even if I was an independently wealthy millionaire, I’m pretty sure that I’d chose to shop with them. Their return policy rocks. If you have a card (maybe even if you don’t, I’m not sure) they give you credits for free alterations which can be really awesome if you find something that you love but doesn’t fit you just right. \n\nI’ve never bothered to do it, but you can call and give a general or specific list of things that you’re looking for (like vacation wear, casual stuff, something to wear to a friend or relatives wedding events, etc). A shopper will get a lot of stuff together and put it aside so that it’s ready for you to look over and try on when you show up. You don’t have to buy any of it either.\n\nWhen I’ve went in just to browse and tried something on, the salesperson always offered to bring me other things if what I had didn’t work. If I said no thanks and didn’t buy anything, they were still friendly and sweet. \n\nIdk, I’ve been to other places where I couldn’t walk for 5 minutes before someone new dying to sell me something would just pop out. I hated that, and haven’t experienced it at nordys. I sound like some kind of company ambassador 😂 🤣\n\n#### Comment ID gzgghig with +8 score by [(Gilmoregirlin, Reddit, 2021-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/gzgghig/) (in reply to ID gzg3dd5):\nI like Nordstrom because they hem things for free and I am short, so long as they are full price.

I've only been inside one true saks once, so i can't comment on that shopping experience, but i definitely prefer shopping at nordstrom over Bloomingdale's. And the nordstrom shoe store is the best out of the 3.\n\nHonestly, I'm at the point where if i need something, i typically check just nordstrom first to see what's available at what price points before i branch out to other stores.

Bloomingdale’s is Macy’s. It’s the same company. You’re paying for their overpriced Macy’s crap. Nordstrom you get their house brands which include actually decent merchandise that have been around for decades as well as the customer service that goes along with it. Neiman’s probably is considered the more exclusive department store in terms of brands carried, but Nordstrom actually does have the exact same depending on your location. Saks is equivalent to Neiman’s but with shorter in person hours & terrible service. I personally look at how many places have discount chain versions of their stores. They all do minus Neiman’s.

Saks Fifth Avenue is a high end department store but Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's are sort of top of the mid-range, just before you get into the luxury department stores. Some Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom stores are more lower high end though when they are the better flagship stores in like New York and Seattle and what not. These stores have Givenchy, Gucci, Prada and other middle of the high end luxury brands, but not Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Hérmes or Dior level. A typical Bloomingdale's or Nordstrom would have like Emporio Armani, Burberry, Max Mara and other entry-level high end brands as their most expensive brands and it certainly wouldn't be the majority of their stock. Maje, Sandro, Rag and Bone, Vera by Vera Wang, Lucky Brand Jeans, J Brand Jeans and other higher end mid-range contemporary brands are more what you'd find at Bloomingdale's or Nordstrom usually.\n\n\nNeiman Marcus is up there with Saks Fifth Avenue too and is even higher end than Saks Fifth Avenue. I feel like Barneys New York was in-between the level of Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus when it was still around.  Though no department store is as high end as Bergdorf Goodman, which only has one store. All of these department stores is where you find your super high end brands like Chanel, Valextra, Giorgio Armani, J Mendel, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Céline, Oscar de la Renta, Hérmes, Akris and what not that you wouldn't even find at a Nordstrom or Bloomingdale's, even if it was one of their fancier stores.\n\n\nAnd then I'd say Lord and Taylor is below Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's and then Macy's is below that, which is the middle of the mid-range stores and is about as middle class as you can get, price-wise. Lord and Taylor you'd find brands like Diane Von Furstenberg, Emporio Armani, Cynthia Rowley and other labels of this level as the absolute best that you could find luxury-wise and premium-wise. And then at Macy's the most expensive might be Emporio Armani at the tippy top, but more like Calvin Klein white label, MK Michael Kors, Ralph by Ralph Lauren, Kenneth Cole, Cole Haan, BCBG Max Azria and other top of the line mid-range labels, before you start getting into the beginning of properly high end stuff. The same would go for Dillard's too, which seems in-between the levels of Macy's and Lord and Taylor, if I'm not mistaken?\n\n\nAnd then JC Penny, Kohl's and Sear's would be the lower-end of the mid-range and would be considered more working-class stores and you would only find the middle of the middle range brands as rhe absolute best you could find there. There are stores cheaper than these, but they aren't properly what you would call department stores. Places like Target, Kmart and Walmart, where those with very little money shop for clothes.\n\n## Comment ID gzmlirp with +1 score by [(lovelypants0, Reddit, 2021-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/gzmlirp/) (in reply to ID nkrqd6):\nNordstrom has great benefits (18 weeks paid maternity leave)",

I have always loved clothes shopping but I notice that I get overwhelmed when shopping online really quickly. My nearest town has a couple of shopping malls and a few local boutiques, but I find that lately the only place I am buying clothes is TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and Nordstrom Rack. I think my issue is that I do love a bargain, so I have a hard time paying full price. I also do try to avoid fast fashion, but I'm looking for a price point that's somewhere above Old Navy/Target but not quite up to Eileen Fisher levels. I do also do a lot of thrifting, and that is fine. When I have tried to shop at other brick and mortar stores, I find that the styles are far too trendy for me. Like, I stopped into Anthropologie today and did not find a single thing that appealed to me. I am less about crop tops and more about items that are classic, flattering, and hopefully have a little interest.

I like department stores for brand variety but I’m also a bargain hunter so I’ll check out places I know have sales often, like J. Crew. Being in the store helps me figure out which brands work for my awkward body type and confirms my size. I can get a feel for fabrics and patterns and then wait for sales online. Of course if I see something I love at an affordable price I’ll buy it but mostly I’m making a mental (or iPhone pic list) of things to stalk later. It’s really helped me stop buying things just because the price is right at the time.\n\n### Comment ID itemp8q with +1 score by [(Cayslayy, Reddit, 2022-10-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/yae17e/i_am_in_a_tj_maxx_marshalls_nordstrom_rack_rut/itemp8q/) (in reply to ID itax98x):\nSame.\n\n## Comment ID itazc2r with +44 score by [(sudden-osprey, Reddit, 2022-10-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/yae17e/i_am_in_a_tj_maxx_marshalls_nordstrom_rack_rut/itazc2r/) (in reply to ID yae17e):\nIf you like Eileen Fisher, just look for the stuff on Poshmark.

I don't know EF well enough to know that there is x, y, or z kind of piece that I am looking for-- so I end up scroll browsing until a brain shutdown point, and then giving up. I also really don't like not being able to return things. When I shop online, it feels like about 50-50 that I am going to keep something, and with thrift shopping online you can rarely return, or if you can it involves a shipping fee. I almost always shop online at a place that is close enough for me to do local returns if needed.\n\n#### Comment ID itmfdvo with +2 score by [(Mammoth-Arrival, Reddit, 2022-10-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/yae17e/i_am_in_a_tj_maxx_marshalls_nordstrom_rack_rut/itmfdvo/) (in reply to ID itc71n5):\nI know exactly what you mean!

Low rise or crop tops are never going to work for my body type, or my job, so I’ve simply started picking up basics (try searching for ‘wool sweater’ ‘fairisle cardigan’ + the brand name) from poshmark, in the sizes and brands I know fit me.

It was easier to tell how things really looked and fit. I noticed that inexpensive H&M or Ross items just never really fit right or felt right. I slowly started letting those go and replacing my selection with higher end stuff, still at a bargain. \n\nI use Nordstrom points, track sales, use coupons, use eBay, Posh, Mercari, Tradesy, Thred-up, The Real Real, and Depop to buy brands I know my size and know the quality of the brand in, and/or vintage items. \n\nI actually don't frequent thrift stores as much as I've found them very picked over lately and mostly filled with fast fashion rejects or increasingly taken over by LuLaRoe, a brand I don't like for many reasons. \n\nI'll also be transparent: I had a financial windfall in 2020 that allowed me to invest in some pieces and take some chances and I also worked for Eileen Fisher for 3 years and the discount is incredibly generous, including FREE clothing every month. So that helped! \n\nMy first step was digging into my real style--making Pinterest boards and experimenting and trying different things. I slowly built up a wardrobe from brands I knew fit and flattered--and even then I made some mistakes! \n\nPeople talk about buying from consignment and I agree, but *selling* to consignment is often a good way to cycle through stuff that's too nice to donate, still has tags, is a higher quality item (most consignment won't take Nordstrom Rack, TJ Maxx, etc) and that just isn't \"you\" anymore.\n\n### Comment ID itci149 with +3 score by [(Paddington_Fear, Reddit, 2022-10-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/yae17e/i_am_in_a_tj_maxx_marshalls_nordstrom_rack_rut/itci149/) (in reply to ID itc70nt):\nhow fun!  love all the tips in your comment.\n\n## Comment ID itbq8yt with +29 score by [(langley80, Reddit, 2022-10-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/yae17e/i_am_in_a_tj_maxx_marshalls_nordstrom_rack_rut/itbq8yt/) (in reply to ID yae17e):\nQuince!

I’m also a fan of Everlane (but lucky to have a store in my city) and they have decent sales. Like others have mentioned, Poshmark is my go to for Jenni Kayne, Nili Lotan, Cuyana and La Ligne (brands/designers I love, but are still a bit out of reach).

I have a few success with athletic clothes and swimwears from lesser known Canadian and Australian brands - I find they are very well made, fit amazing and wash well while at a considerable lower price point than Nike/Adidas/Lulu, etc.\n\nFor casual clothes, I only reach for natural materials wool/linen/cotton, or 95% recycled fibers for winterwear. The ones with Italian labels tend to have a classic cut but better substantial fabric compared to contemporary American brands - I avoid the latters as they tend to be Outlet products.\n\nI buy jeans in Mark's, blazers and semi-formalwear in Banana Republics (past season sale, not outlets), trendy one-of-a-kind vacation dresses in Mango, coat/designer's stuffs online Simons/SSense/The Last Hunt.\n\nLast but not least, whatever you buy, make sure to try them on.

I'm curvy and size L fits me fabulous. It's my favorite set for outdoor activities: from biking, hiking to casual lunches on hotter days.Haven't tried leggings yet, but their tank tops with built-in bras are also lovely.\n\nRe: Australian brands, I recommend their  swimwears: High quality fabric ✅️, some even has lining✅️, tummy tuck and boob support ✅️, various designs from conservative to low-key sexy ✅️, eye-catching colorful but fit like a Speedo ✅️, $30 in Marshall's but  could probably be $90+ in Department stores.\n\n## Comment ID itapitx with +15 score by [(PlantedinCA, Reddit, 2022-10-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/yae17e/i_am_in_a_tj_maxx_marshalls_nordstrom_rack_rut/itapitx/) (in reply to ID yae17e):\nBanana Republic or J.Crew outlet?

It works for me because it's fun enough to me to be a hobby. In-person shopping is for inspiration and fit checks, even sale rack prices are usually too high for me lol. That said, my average price per piece is so low that if I see something amazingly perfect in a store I will buy it at any price with no regrets because I keep my overall clothing costs so low. \n\nIf you like in person shopping, high quality and below EF price point, I think you need to get comfortable with the idea that you're going to be hunting: clearance racks at nicer stores, consignment, thrifting. If you like Nordstrom rack there are occasionally high quality pieces that were diverted from an actual store, I can usually tell by the tag and the fact that there's not 20 of the same garment on a rack. I don't think you get a curated selection without compromising on the other things.  If you're overwhelmed by online shopping, maybe just buy less and be ok spending a bit more to decrease your effort level.\n\n## Comment ID itd5v0l with +2 score by [(piratequeenfaile, Reddit, 2022-10-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/yae17e/i_am_in_a_tj_maxx_marshalls_nordstrom_rack_rut/itd5v0l/) (in reply to ID yae17e):\nI think you might like some of Aritzia's more classic lines\n\n## Comment ID ite2jou with +2 score by [(Less-Maintenance-21, Reddit, 2022-10-22)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/yae17e/i_am_in_a_tj_maxx_marshalls_nordstrom_rack_rut/ite2jou/) (in reply to ID yae17e):\nEveryone’s thoughts on Boden?

They weren’t able to get the cases open and ran out. The store oddly stayed open and just had broken glass everywhere at the entrance and the manager was at the front greeting people like nothing happened. The police arrived as I was leaving. It was very odd, but yes, good selection. There is also a discount Bloomingdales outlet right next door, which has amazing deals.\n\n### Comment ID kf69khs with +3 score by [(studio28, Reddit, 2023-12-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/18s9xmm/best_nordstrom_rack_in_la/kf69khs/) (in reply to ID kf69168):\nBeen meaning to go over there\n\n## Comment ID kf7el57 with +49 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-12-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/18s9xmm/best_nordstrom_rack_in_la/kf7el57/) (in reply to ID 18s9xmm):\nI feel like they are all crap now.

As the Sperry site only stocks specific (Mostly newer) styles.\n\nEdit: Newer Sperry skus start with 'STS' so you should be able to type that SKU number into the search feature on the site and find it.\n\n### Comment ID eyryu2y with +10 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/eyryu2y/) (in reply to ID eyrt7kf):\nThank you I'll have to try this\n\n## Comment ID eyrc4ch with +67 score by [(Dacyco, Reddit, 2019-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/eyrc4ch/) (in reply to ID cybu0w):\nIt is also possible that the shoes you bought at Nordstrom Rack are a much older model no longer sold in their website.\n\n### Comment ID eyrfpe8 with +16 score by [(meriendaselgato, Reddit, 2019-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/eyrfpe8/) (in reply to ID eyrc4ch):\nThat's my guess–  the style was made this season at a different factory and the ones she got were from a past season.

We'll get a like 20-min crash course on what to do. Find the return slip, look up the order, find the item being returned, credit the customer, throw it in a bag and send the item off to Inspections. \n\nWe are held to strict time standards and get less than 5 minutes to process each return. At that point, all we're looking for is the brand, size and color to match what was bought. So unless it's something glaringly obvious, like a different color, then any authenticity differences are not going to be noticed.\n\nThe next department (Inspections), checks to see how worn/damaged the item is, (but still isn't really trained much on signs of authenticity). \nAnd they get even less time @ literally 50 seconds per piece. \nThe running joke there is to just \"close your eyes and fold.\" \n\nOtherwise, actually inspecting the piece, lint rolling, cleaning, even buttoning it up, etc. takes up too much time. If you don't find a way to meet the time standards, eventually you'll lose your job. For most people, that way is to just not look too closely. \nI feel very bad about the quality they secondhand force us to send back out with the lousy time standards. I always say I don't hate the customer enough to work in Returns full time. \n\nAnyway, after inspecting, the piece is marked \"Good\" or \"Poor\". If it's \"Good\", it will go back to stock.\n\nIf it's \"Good\" but out of season, (since we accept returns from 100 years ago), it will then go to...boom, Nordstrom Rack. \n\nWe process tens of thousands of orders per day. I think the record right now is almost 40k in a day. \n\nSo, yeahhh totally possible. \n¯\\_(;--;)_/¯\n\n### Comment ID eysioy4 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-09-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/eysioy4/) (in reply to ID eysh8ft):\nThank you for the insight!\n\n### Comment ID f24sjcy with +1 score by [(mitch8893, Reddit, 2019-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/f24sjcy/) (in reply to ID eysh8ft):\nI am curious..

The chaotic pressure sharks circling feeling of the sale can be really unpleasant so I always write out a list ahead of time and who I’m shopping for Christmas gifts for. \n\nI’ve already done my shopping of the sale, thank goodness, but did fill in those gaps in my fall wardrobe. \n\nThis year the shoes were a huge pass for me, but I’d been putting off buying new Ugg slippers for me and my mom for a while so those were a really good saving. The skincare products I’d hoped for were honestly not that great of a deal so I passed. \n\nThis year the overall impression is that Nordstrom was primarily pushing their in house brands which makes me...skeptical of savings. Knowing that brands like Vince and Theory will well the same items on their own websites helps me feel that I did get a genuine saving. But since Nordstrom sets their own prices on their own lines...it feels a bit more like the outlet stock approach than genuine discounts.\n\n## Comment ID etkpay7 with +9 score by [(PlasticPalm, Reddit, 2019-07-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/cby3en/do_you_shop_the_nordstrom_anniversary_sale/etkpay7/) (in reply to ID cby3en):\nThis year's sale looks weak to me.

Like others have said, it is great to fill in any gaps in your fall/winter wardrobe. I usually get a few cute sweaters, Zella leggings, one pair of boots or booties and maybe a few other accessories. There are sometimes good discounts on perfume, makeup and skincare products so look at that as well. I understand that you may be able to find some of the items later on at a even cheaper price at Nordstrom Rack, but I wear an XS or XXS if available and those sizes are often sold out so I like to shop early. All in all, I think the sale is really good and am looking forward to shopping tomorrow :)\n\n## Comment ID etjerex with +15 score by [(Shadowy_lady, Reddit, 2019-07-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/cby3en/do_you_shop_the_nordstrom_anniversary_sale/etjerex/) (in reply to ID cby3en):\nI generally don't shop it and ignore all bloggers posts on it.

It was my main spend for the year and I was very serious about it. I even made an appointment with a personal shopper for the sale for a couple of years. \n\nI haven’t been as enthused about it for the last few years. this is probably a combination of my workplace going more causal and my perceived decline in the quality of the sale items. \n\nI will say it’s a great sale for beauty deals. They’re special for the sale, usually a combination of items, but if they’re all items you will actually use, it’s a significant  discount.\n\nEdited to add, I have early access and looked over the items today.

Partly it's because my tastes and style have changed, I think, but nothing has been catching my eye there lately, especially not in the sale. I took a look and it's the same stuff that's been on offer in previous years - the same long cardigans, the same denim, the same drapey leather jackets. I guess it's good if you need to restock basics, but it's not inspiring to me.\n\nI'm also surprised at how not on-trend the items are this year. As the silhouette changes to higher waists, wider legs, and more cropped tops, Nordstrom continues to sell tunic-length sweaters, skinny jeans, and duster cardigans. It seems like their buyers are erring on the side of mainstream over trends, but I just wish there was a better balance on offer.\n\nI did see that the leather Madewell tote is on sale, and I've been wanting one for months, as well as the Spanx leather leggings which rarely go on sale, so it's not a total dud!\n\nETA: they do have some good shoes in the sale as well.

And century 21. But TJ Maxx will always have them best on price. \n\nI live in NYC and I guess they have something different here that they don’t have at all locations called “Runway” where it’s solid brands. In the last month I have purchased:\n\nBrunello Cuccinelli cashmere sweater - $99\n\nLoro Piana Rain Trench - $320\n\nCurrent collection Gucci Polo - $140\n\n\nI think the most incredible thing I ever found was a Chrome Hearts leather moto-zip jacket for $250. Like. WHAT!? (For those who aren’t familiar, it’s a brand that doesn’t advertise, never goes on sale, and is insanely expensive. The jackets’ they do use vintage Hermes scarves as the lining.

For other uses, see Nordstrom (disambiguation).\n\nNordstrom, Inc. ( ) is an American luxury department store chain headquartered in Seattle, Washington, and founded by John W. Nordstrom and Carl F. Wallin in 1901. The original store operated exclusively as a shoe store, and a second location opened in 1923. The growing chain began selling clothing in 1963, and became the full-line retailer that presently exists by 1971. The company founded its off-price Nordstrom Rack division in 1973, and grew both full-line and off-price divisions throughout the United States in the following years. The full-line division competes with department stores including Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, and Saks Fifth Avenue, while the off-price division competes with retailers including the TJX Companies and Ross Stores.[2] Previous expansions beyond the contiguous United States include Puerto Rico (2015–2020) and Canada (2014–2023).\n\nEarly history\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn W. Nordstrom was born on February 15, 1871, in the village Alvik near Luleå in Northern Sweden.[3] In 1887, Nordstrom immigrated to the United States at the age of 16.[3][4] His name at birth was Johan Wilhelm Nordström (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈjuːhɑn ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈnuːr(d)strœm]), which he later anglicized to John W. Nordstrom. After landing in New York, he began working in Michigan and was able to save enough money to purchase a 20-acre (81,000 m2) potato farm in Arlington, Washington.[3] In 1897, he joined the Klondike Gold Rush in Canada's Yukon Territory. After two years of prospecting, he finally struck gold, but sold his disputed claim for $13,000.[3] Returning to Seattle with his newfound wealth, he married Hilda Carlson in 1900 and searched for a business venture.[3]\n\nOperations during 20th century\n\n[edit]\n\nWallin & Nordstrom and Nordstrom Best\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom eventually settled on a shoe store that opened in 1901, called Wallin & Nordstrom.[4] Carl F. Wallin, the co-founder of the store, was the owner of the adjacent shoe repair shop.[3] John and Hilda had five children, three of whom would follow him into the family business, Everett W. (1903), Elmer J. (1904) and Lloyd N. Nordstrom.[5][6]\n\nIn 1928, John W. Nordstrom retired and sold his shares to two of his sons, Everett and Elmer. In 1929, Wallin also retired and sold his shares to them. The 1930 grand opening of the remodeled Second Avenue store marked the change of name to Nordstrom. Lloyd Nordstrom subsequently joined the company in 1933, and the three brothers ran the business together for almost forty years.[7]\n\nBy 1958, Nordstrom had expanded to eight stores in two states but still sold only shoes. Apparel came with its purchase of Best's Apparel of Seattle in 1963, and the company's name was changed to Nordstrom Best.[8]\n\nFollowing renaming to Nordstrom\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1971, the company was taken public on National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ). It was one of the first companies to be listed on the then-newly established stock exchange.[9] It was moved to the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 under the ticker symbol JWN after John W. Nordstrom, its founder.[8]\n\nTheir business continued beyond stores in 1974. On December 5, the National Football League announced the signing of a franchise agreement that would put a team in Seattle, Washington. Representing the family as majority partner of the consortium was Lloyd W. Nordstrom. However, he would never see a game as owner, as he died of a heart attack on January 20, 1976, eight months before the newly christened Seattle Seahawks took the field.[10] With his death, the estate of Mr. Nordstrom would oversee the team, with co-owner and entrepreneur Herman Sarkowsky serving as the team's first chief operating officer.[11][12]\n\nBy 1975, Nordstrom expanded into Alaska (the only time by acquisition) by purchasing Northern Commercial Company and opened its first Nordstrom Rack clearance store in Seattle. A strong northwest regional retailer with sales already approaching $250 million making it the third-largest specialty retailer in the United States, the company opened its first Southern California store at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa in 1978.[13] By the early 1990s, it had opened 26 stores plus Racks in California. Subsequent expansion relied on creating a strongly decentralized regional structure, beginning with the Northeast in the Tysons Corner Center in Virginia (1988), the Midwest in the Oakbrook Center in Illinois (1991), the Southeast in Atlanta (1998), and the Southwest in Dallas (1996). In a new region, the initial store was used as a base for training and recruitment for subsequent expansion, and was usually backed by its own distribution center. From 1978 to 1995, Nordstrom opened a total of 46 full-line department stores.[14]\n\nIn 1976, Nordstrom opened a series of stores called Place Two to sell a more limited selection of apparel in smaller markets. By 1983, there were ten Place Two stores, but the cost of upgrading the smaller stores, especially from a systems perspective, outweighed the benefit, and the division was discontinued.[15] The last two remaining Place Two stores closed on April 1, 1995.[16] In August 1988, the Nordstroms sold the Seahawks to real estate developer Ken Behring and his partner Ken Hofmann for $80 million.[17][18][19]\n\nThe company also expanded into direct sales in 1993, beginning with a catalog division[20] led by John N.'s son Dan that was followed by an e-commerce business. Nordstrom.com's fulfillment and contact centers are located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Seattle, Washington. Currently, it has distribution centers in Ontario, California; Newark, California; Portland, Oregon; Dubuque, Iowa; Upper Marlboro, Maryland; and Gainesville, Florida.\n\nNordstrom FSB, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nordstrom, Inc., is a federally chartered savings bank doing business as Nordstrom Bank. It was formed in 1991 in Scottsdale, Arizona, with its customer contact center in Centennial, Colorado. Nordstrom FSB was formerly known as Nordstrom National Credit Bank and changed its name to Nordstrom FSB in March 2000. The bank offers various banking and credit products, such as Nordstrom Signature VISA, Nordstrom retail credit and debit cards, interest-bearing checking accounts, check cards, and certificates of deposits. It offers Nordstrom customers cards under Nordstrom Rewards – its customer loyalty program – where customers earn points when making purchases with the card at Nordstrom and other retailers.\n\nIn 1995, Nordstrom opened their first store location in New York State.[21] It is located at The Westchester, an upscale shopping mall in White Plains, New York, a suburb of New York City. Nordstrom has since opened stores at Roosevelt Field in Garden City, New York in 1997,[22] and Manhattan in 2019.[23]\n\nBeginning in 1995, the fourth generation of brothers and cousins had been co-presidents for a time. John Whitacre was appointed as the first non-Nordstrom CEO in 1997.[24] In 1998, Nordstrom replaced its downtown Seattle store with a new flagship location in the former Frederick & Nelson building across the street. A two-year renovation of this location was completed in 2016.[25] At 383,000 square feet (35,600 m2), the downtown Seattle location is the chain's largest store. By contrast, the smallest Nordstrom store, as of September 2008, opened in 1980 in Salem, Oregon, with a total area of just under 72,000 square feet (6,700 m2). This location has since closed.\n\nIn 1998, Nordstrom opened its first location in the Southeast at Perimeter Mall in Atlanta, Georgia.[26]\n\nOperations during 21st century\n\n[edit]\n\n2000–2009\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2000, the Nordstrom family reasserted its control, with the sons of Bruce A. (Blake, Erik and Peter) assuming senior roles in the company which they continue to hold.[27] Blake Nordstrom served as sole President of the company from 2000 to 2014 with Erik and Peter joining him as co-Presidents in 2015.[28]\n\nNordstrom sold its stand-alone boutique chain Façonnable in 2007, though it still offers that label in its lineup.\n\n2010–2019\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2011, Nordstrom announced the acquisition of HauteLook, an LA-based online retailer that offers flash sales on designer goods. The deal included Nordstrom paying $180 million in stock and a three-year \"earn-out\" payment based on HauteLook's financial performance.[29] On May 26, 2011, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing the downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, Circle Center Mall location due to declining business at the site. The remaining location on the north side of the city at the Fashion Mall at Keystone as well as the future Nordstrom Rack store in the Rivers Edge Shopping Center, also on the north side, remained as the only two locations in the state. Erik Nordstrom, president of stores at Nordstrom stated, \"We've enjoyed serving our customers in downtown Indianapolis, but unfortunately our business has declined over the long term for some time and despite our efforts to turn things around we don't see the outlook significantly changing.\"[30]\n\nIn August 2011, Nordstrom opened the store Treasure & Bond in SoHo, New York. Intended to test the waters of the tumultuous high-end department store scene in New York, all profits of Treasure & Bond are donated to charity. The customer base of the smaller store is thought to be the younger sisters of the typical Nordstrom customer.[31]\n\nNordstrom announced plans to open a Nordstrom Rack in Milwaukee in 2014.[32] In late November 2012, Nordstrom announced that they would also be opening a full-line Nordstrom Department Store in 2015 in Milwaukee at Mayfair Mall, a half-mile away from the Nordstrom Rack location. Milwaukee was the largest metropolitan area in the country that did not have a Nordstrom until 2015. Such unmet demand was highlighted in Nordstrom's decision to open in the Milwaukee area.[33]\n\nOn January 4, 2013, Nordstrom announced plans for a new location in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan region. The store, to be located at the Ridgedale Center, would be the second in the area. Following the success of its Mall of America opening in 1992, Nordstrom sought to expand in the Twin Cities market.[34] Plans for a Ridgedale Center store were first released in 2007, only to be canceled in 2009.[35] The location eventually opened in September 2015.\n\nNordstrom opened a 138,000-square-foot, two-level, full-line store March 2015 in The Mall of San Juan in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[36] After Hurricane Maria in 2017, the store suffered major water damage and it closed temporarily after the hurricane. Nordstrom reopened the store on November 9, 2018.[37] On May 7, 2020, Nordstrom announced that it would not reopen due to COVID-19 pandemic, leaving this store closed permanently.\n\nIn May 2015, Pete and Erik Nordstrom joined their brother Blake Nordstrom as co-presidents of Nordstrom. This arrangement lasted until Blake Nordstrom's death in January 2019.[38] Before this appointment, Pete Nordstrom was executive vice president and president of merchandising while Erik Nordstrom was executive vice president and president of Nordstrom.com.[38]\n\nNordstrom opened its first Rack location in Philadelphia in the fall of 2014.[39] In the fall of 2015, Nordstrom opened their first Nordstrom Rack store in Delaware.[40] The company is opening its first full-line store in New York City on April 12, 2018, a three-floor store at 57th Street and Broadway, in the Columbus Circle neighborhood.[41]\n\nIn 2016, Nordstrom entered into a partnership with Tesla Motors under which the automaker opened retail galleries inside the Nordstrom locations in The Grove, Los Angeles, in SouthPark Mall in Charlotte, North Carolina and in Somerset Collection in Troy, Michigan.[42][43]\n\nIn 2016, Nordstrom began selling products from J. Crew, Olivia Palermo + Chelsea28, Adore Me, and Eloquii.[44][45][46][47] In 2017, Nordstrom announced they would be expanding their natural beauty-focused stations.[48]\n\nOn February 2, 2017, Bloomberg News reported that Nordstrom would cease to carry Ivanka Trump's branded fashion line, citing weak sales. The retailer cuts 10 percent of its most poorly performing brands each year. Nordstrom's action came after a boycott campaign against retailers carrying products having Trump family labels.[49][50] President Donald Trump responded with a tweet directed at Nordstrom, condemning the brand for its treatment of his daughter. The company's stock dropped by 0.65% in the aftermath of the tweet before ending the day with a gain of more than 4%. Fortune declared this quick recovery to have broken Trump's market-moving \"tweet curse\".[51][52][53][54]\n\nIn October 2017, Nordstrom launched its first \"Nordstrom Local\" in West Hollywood, which is set to focus on personal shopping and styling, rather than carrying merchandise. In June 2017, Nordstrom Inc.'s founding family, which owned 31.2 percent of the company, said it was looking to take Nordstrom private.[55] In October, the family suspended its efforts, because of trouble completing a financing package.[56] Lenders were asking for 13 percent interest, about twice the typical rate for retailers.[57]\n\nOn January 2, 2019 Blake Nordstrom, co-president of Nordstrom, died suddenly at the age of 58. He was a lifetime employee of his family's company, rising through the ranks until he became a vice-president and then co-president.[58]\n\nIn fiscal year 2019, digital sales reached 33% of total sales, marking a growing transition to online retail.[59]\n\n2020–present\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 3, 2020, Erik Nordstrom became the sole CEO of Nordstrom.[60]\n\nOn March 16, the company announced that effective the following day, all locations would temporarily close during the COVID-19 pandemic.[61] On May 5, Nordstrom began reopening stores and announced that sixteen locations would permanently close by August.[62][63]\n\nIn late September, Nordstrom announced that by the end of 2021, their stores and websites would no longer sell products made from fur or exotic skins.[64]\n\nIn October 2021, Nordstrom announced an agreement with 11 Honoré, an online retailer of plus-sized designer fashion, to sell the company's clothing in Nordstrom stores and on their website.[65]\n\nOn December 23, 2024, Nordstrom announced their plans to take the company private in a deal valued at $6.25 billion. The plan involves selling 49.9% percent of the company to Mexican department store and real estate company El Puerto de Liverpool, with the remaining 50.1% controlling stake being held by the Nordstrom family. On the deal, CEO Erik Nordstrom stated that “Today marks an exciting new chapter for the business. On behalf of my family, we look forward to working with our teams to ensure Nordstrom thrives long into the future.” [66]\n\nNordstrom Canada\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom Canada Retail, Inc. (French: Les Detaillants Nordstrom Canada, Inc.) was the Canadian division of Nordstrom. It was announced on September 13, 2012, opened its first store on September 19, 2014, and closed its final stores on June 13, 2023. In this market, it competed with Canadian department stores including Holt Renfrew, Hudson's Bay, and Simons.[68]\n\nFour full-line Nordstrom stores were announced for the first phase of expansion, with nine full-line stores total expected in the long term.[69] Most of these stores were located in vacated Sears Canada storefronts in Cadillac Fairview-managed shopping centers, including Chinook Centre in Calgary; Rideau Centre in Ottawa; Toronto Eaton Centre in Toronto; and Pacific Centre in Vancouver. The stores at the CF-managed Sherway Gardens and the Oxford-managed Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto were new construction.[70] Of the first four stores announced, the Calgary store was the first to open on September 19, 2014.[71] It was followed by the Ottawa store on March 6, 2015;[72] the Vancouver store on September 18, 2015;[73] and the Sherway Gardens store on September 15, 2017.[74] The Yorkdale store was confirmed on April 8, 2013,[75] and opened on October 21, 2016.[76] The Toronto Eaton Centre was the last of the six stores to be announced on January 15, 2014,[77] however, it was the fourth to open on September 18, 2016.[78]\n\nThe first Nordstrom Rack opened at Vaughan Mills on March 21, 2018; and then a second location in Deerfoot Meadows in Calgary and a flagship location at One Bloor in Toronto opened on May 3, 2018.[79] Nordstrom Rack opened three other additional stores in Fall 2018; one at Heartland Town Centre in Mississauga, one at Ottawa Trainyards, and finally one at South Edmonton Commons.\n\nOn March 2, 2023, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing all their Canadian stores, which would entail 2,500 staff losing their jobs. The company stated, \"Despite our best efforts, we do not see a realistic path to profitability for the Canadian business.\"[80] The closing would be done under court supervision within the framework of the Canadian Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA), with the help of a third-party liquidator.[81] Liquidation sales began for all locations on March 21, 2023. All Canadian Nordstrom Rack locations closed on May 14, 2023,[82] while all Canadian full-line stores closed on June 13, 2023.\n\nRetail formats\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of May 2022 , there are 100 full-line Nordstrom department stores,[83] which average 140,000 square feet (13,000 m2).[84]\n\nNordstrom holds six annual sales. Two of these are Half-Yearly sales, which take place semi-annually in May and late December, as well as three additional seasonal sales. Nordstrom's largest sale event is the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, which is held each July.[85] Limited amounts of merchandise set to be released for the following fall are sent to Nordstrom stores early, where they are sold at discount. For ten days prior to Anniversary Sale, Nordstrom gives early access to members who make appointments.[86]\n\nNordstrom Local\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom Local service hubs are oriented for amenities including online order pickup, personal styling, and tailoring. They do not have their own inventory, and instead source merchandise from full-line stores as needed. As of May 2022 , there are seven Nordstrom Local locations between New York City and Los Angeles,[83] which average 3,000 square feet (280 m2).[84]\n\nRestaurants\n\n[edit]\n\nFast casual and full-service restaurants operate within most Nordstrom full-line stores.[87]\n\nList of Nordstrom restaurants[88] Restaurant Concept type Year\n\ndebuted Notes Bar Verde 2013 Bistro Verde Bazille Broadway Bar Bar Located within New York City flagship store Burger Bar American 2022 Located within New York City flagship store Cafe Bistro Cafe Nordstrom Classic Cafe 1980 Rebranded as Marketplace Cafe in 1998 Ebar Coffeehouse Gelato Bar 2016 Located in Ala Moana Center store Habitant Bar 2013 Hani Pacific Hawaiian 2019 Previously located within New York City flagship store Jeannie's Pizza 2019 Marketplace Cafe Comfort food 1998 Rebranded from Classic Cafe Milk Bar Bakery 2019 Located in New York City men's store Nordstrom Grill American NYC Clubhouse Bar Located in New York City men's store Oh Mochi Mochi donuts Ruscello Mediterranean Shoe Bar Bar Sweet Sundae Bar Dessert Wolf Italian 2019 Located within New York City flagship store\n\nNordstrom Rack\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Nordstrom Rack\n\nNordstrom Rack originated as a bargain basement in the downtown Seattle flagship store in 1973.

      "# [Nordstroms succeed in taking company private for $6.25B by Daphne Howland on 2024-12-23](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstroms-puerto-liverpool-company-private-625b/736220/)\nErik, Pete and Jamie Nordstrom and other members of the founding family have succeeded in their effort to bring the retailer, established over a century ago by their forebear John W. Nordstrom, back under family control, in an all-cash transaction valued at about $6.25 billion.\n\nThe family group plus Mexican retail conglomerate El Puerto de Liverpool will acquire all the outstanding common shares they don’t already own. The transaction is financed through a combination of rollover equity by the Nordstrom family and Liverpool; cash commitments by Liverpool; up to $450 million in borrowings under a new $1.2 billion ABL bank financing; and the company’s cash on hand.\n\nDebt will be mostly unchanged: the $2.7 billion principal of existing senior notes and long-term debt will remain outstanding. As part of the transaction, Nordstrom expects to secure existing senior notes and debentures with a second lien on its current assets and related collateral and a first lien on other assets (excluding real estate), per the release.\n\nFollowing the closing, the Nordstrom family will be the majority owners of the company, and Liverpool will own 49.9%. Erik and Pete Nordstrom’s great-grandfather launched the business as a shoe store in Seattle in 1901.\n\nThe deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory and other conditions. It still needs the approval of two-thirds of the holders of Nordstrom’s common stock and of a majority of shareholders outside of the family, Liverpool, directors and other officers.\n\nThe company’s common stockholders will receive $24.25 per share in cash, a premium of some 42% to the closing price on March 18. Once the deal closes, the board also plans to authorize a special dividend of up to 25 cents per share.\n\nFour years ago, Erik Nordstrom took the reins as sole chief executive and Pete Nordstrom was named president and chief brand officer; Jamie Nordstrom is chief merchant as of last year. The department store’s board of directors (with Erik and Pete Nordstrom recusing themselves) unanimously approved the transaction, according to a company press release.\n\nIn September, the Nordstroms and Liverpool offered $3.8 billion to make this move, and a special committee of the board was established to mull the proposal. Their success in following through will allow them to “take a long term view of the business and make necessary investments and changes away from the short term scrutiny of public markets,” though it won’t cure all ills, GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said by email.\n\nThe department store is hardly the worst performer in its sector, but it hasn’t measured up to its own past standards in merchandising and operations, including store operations, according to Saunders.",

She likes that they help her move around freely without weighing her down, plus the shoe’s tongue is attached to the upper, which keeps it in place as you run.\n\nAdidas Women's Ultraboost 1.0 Running Sneakers\n\nI got my first pair of Ultraboosts as a gift back in 2018, and they lasted me over six years as my go-to gym shoes. They have a cushioned, springy sole that’s comfortable for walking, working out and all-day wear, in my experience. They’re made from recycled ocean plastic that gives the sneaker lots of stretch, so it can give your feet gentle but still firm support, according to the brand. I also love that the shoes are designed to be pull-on, so no need to fuss with laces; you just slide your feet in and you’re good to go.\n\nHoka Men's Clifton 9 Running Shoe\n\nThe Hoka Clifton 9 is our choice for best overall Hoka walking shoe because it has “just the right amount of everything”, says NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin. She walked for miles in these shoes and says they have great traction and a springy outsole that helps to propel her feet forward. NBC Select commerce editor Cory Fernandez also says they’re very comfortable and fit true to size.\n\nNike Women's Air Zoom Pegasus 41 Running Shoe\n\nThese running shoes are designed for all-weather use — they have a rubber sole inspired by winter tires, which helps them grip the ground and channel water out of the way while you run, according to the brand. The sneaker’s upper is made from a water-resistant mesh material, and the shoe also has removable, cushioned insoles for extra comfort.\n\nAsics Men’s Gel Nimbus 26 Paris Running Shoe\n\nYou can use these sneakers for both running and everyday wear. They have a gel cushion that’s designed to absorb impact as you walk for more comfort, and a knit upper for breathability, according to the brand. The sneaker also has reflective details to make them visible in the evening and during night runs, according to Asics.\n\nSaucony Women's Ride 17 Running Shoe\n\nSaucony makes some of our favorite running shoes, and this model is made from a breathable mesh and foam for extra cushioning while you run, according to the brand. The mesh ventilates your feet and prevents excessive sweating, while the removable, cushioned insole helps with arch support, says Saucony.\n\nNew Balance Women's 550 Basketball Sneaker\n\nThis sneaker is made from a strong, synthetic leather that can easily hold up to wear and tear that comes with playing basketball outdoors, according to the brand. It’s highly rated with a 4.3-star average rating from 24 reviews at Nordstrom, and has soft, fabric details that add to the vintage design.\n\nBrooks Men's Ghost 15 Gore-tex Waterproof Running Shoe\n\nWe’re huge Brooks fans at NBC Select, and this model is ideal for all-weather running. The mesh upper is covered in a water-resistant layer that helps protect it against rain and puddles, according to the brand. The shoe also has increased cushioning, plus a 4.1-star average rating from 53 reviews at Nordstrom.\n\nSalomon Speedcross 3 Trail Running Sneaker\n\nYou can wear these gender-inclusive Salomon sneakers in any terrain, according to the brand. They have a one-pull lace system that makes it easy to slip them on and off, and includes mudguards and added traction on the soles for rougher terrain. The sneakers also have extra cushioning for comfort while hiking, according to the brand.\n\nMore Nordstrom sneaker deals to shop now\n\nUp to 60% off Nike\n\nUp to 60% off AllSaints\n\nUp to 60% off Tory Burch\n\nUp to 60% off Vince\n\nWhy trust NBC Select?\n\nI’m an associate SEO reporter for NBC Select who’s been covering deals and sales for over a year.

      "# [Nordstrom stops accepting checks as a form of payment – NBC Chicago by Francie Swidler on 2025-02-27](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/business/nordstrom-no-longer-accepts-personal-checks-as-form-of-payment/3683608/)\nMajor department store Nordstrom will no longer accept checks or money orders as a form of in-store payment or in-store bill pay, the retail giant confirmed to NBC Chicago.\n\nThe change went into effect Monday, Feb. 24, 2025, a customer service representative said, and applies to both Nordstrom Rack and Nordstrom department stores. Nordstrom later confirmed the change to NBC Chicago.\n\nNordstrom told NBC Chicago that it notified \"impacted customers\" of the transition in January of 2025 but did not elaborate. Nordstrom also told NBC Chicago that in 2020 it had begun to shift away from accepting checks for in-store purchases. A sales associate from Nordstrom at Skokie's Westfield Old Orchard Mall told NBC Chicago the store had accepted checks up until Feb. 24.\n\nAs of Thursday, the new check policy was not reflected on Nordstrom's website. Under a payment method FAQ, Nordstrom stated that cash, COD, checks, money orders and gift cards were not accepted for online purchases. No information about in-store purchases was provided.\n\nThe change comes two months after the century-old department store agreed to be acquired and taken private by Nordstrom family members and a Mexican retail group in a $6.25 billion deal. As part of the deal, Nordstrom shareholders will receive $24.25 in cash for each share of Nordstrom common stock, or about $4 billion in all, representing a 42% premium on the company’s stock as of March 18, 2024, when reports of a potential transaction was reported by the media.\n\nThe acquiring group will also pick up more than $2 billion in Nordstrom debt. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025, at which time the company’s shares will no longer trade publicly.\n\nIn 2023, Nordstrom announced it was closing all of its Canadian stores and cutting 2,500 jobs as it winds down operations in the country. Nordstrom first announced plans to expand to Canada in 2012 and opened its first store in Calgary at CF Chinook Centre in September 2014.\n\nLocal\n\nOther retailers that no longer accept checks\n\nOther big retailers stores have also moved to stop accepting checks as a form of payment. In 2024, Target announced it would no longer accept personal checks, citing \"extremely low volumes.\" According to a recent survey from GoBanking Rates, 46% of Americans did not write a single check in 2024.\n\nSome large stores still do accept checks as a form of in-store payment, including Costco, Walmart, Sam's Club and Jewel-Osco, according to their website.",

      "# [Nordstrom family strikes deal to take company private by Beth Duckett, Brian Warmoth, Mary Meisenzahl, Bloomberg report, Abbas Haleem on 2024-12-27](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/12/27/nordstrom-family-strikes-deal-to-take-company-private/)\nNordstrom is returning to its roots as a private company. The founding family of the iconic department store chain, in partnership with Mexican retailer El Puerto de Liverpool, has finalized a $6.25 billion all-cash deal to acquire the company. Recently approved by Nordstrom’s board, the deal values shares at $24.25 each and includes existing debt.\n\nThe agreement marks the Nordstrom family’s second attempt to go private after a failed bid nearly seven years ago. For the retailer, the move offers more flexibility to pursue long-term growth strategies — including in ecommerce — without the pressure of quarterly financial reporting.\n\nNordstrom ranks No. 23 in Digital Commerce 360’s Top 1000 Database of the largest online retailers in North America, where it falls under the Apparel & Accessories category. The retailer operates the Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brands. Digital Commerce 360 projects Nordstom’s online sales will reach $5.28 billion in 2024.\n\nNordstrom web sales by year\n\nNordstrom family’s second attempt to take company private\n\nFounded in 1901 as a Seattle-based shoe store, Nordstrom went public in 1971. This is the second buyout attempt by the Nordstrom family, following a 2018 bid valued at $8.4 billion, which was rejected by the board.\n\nIn February 2024, Nordstrom’s board formed a special committee of independent directors after CEO Erik Nordstrom and president Peter Nordstrom expressed renewed interest in taking the company private. At the time, the family owned 33.4% of the company, while El Puerto de Liverpool held a 9.6% stake, acquired in 2022 for approximately $300 million.\n\nBy September 2024, the family and Liverpool proposed a $23-per-share buyout offer. After review, the board approved a revised offer of $24.25 per share — a 42% premium over the stock’s price on March 18, when reports of the buyout first emerged.\n\nErik and Peter Nordstrom recused themselves from the final vote, and the board unanimously approved the transaction.\n\n“Following a rigorous and independent evaluation and consultation with outside financial and legal advisors, the special committee unanimously concluded that this transaction offers greater value for all public shareholders at a significant premium to the unaffected share price,” said Eric Sprunk, who is chairman of the special committee and former COO of Nike, in a statement.\n\nNordstrom deal’s financing details\n\nUnder the agreement, the Nordstrom family will own 50.1% of the company, while Liverpool will hold 49.9%.\n\nThe deal will be financed through:\n\nA mix of equity contributions from the Nordstrom family and El Puerto de Liverpool\n\nCash commitments from Liverpool\n\nUp to $450 million in new borrowings under a $1.2 billion asset-backed loan\n\nCompany cash reserves\n\nNordstrom’s existing $2.7 billion in debt will remain in place after the transaction.\n\nAs part of the deal, Liverpool will gain a seat on Nordstrom’s board, giving the Mexican retailer more influence over strategic decisions. Liverpool ranks No. 30 in Digital Commerce 360’s Top 1000, with 2024 online sales projected to hit $3.89 billion.\n\nThe deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory approval.\n\nEcommerce and digital growth remain a focus\n\nThe deal comes as Nordstrom works to enhance its ecommerce business and drive digital growth.\n\nEarlier this year, the company announced a new online marketplace on Nordstrom.com and an enhanced search feature. The marketplace broadens its product selection, with more brands, sizes, and styles, while giving partners like Mulberry and Adore Me increased visibility.\n\nRecent sales performance paints a mixed picture. For the 2023 fiscal year ending Feb. 3, 2024, Nordstrom reported $14.22 billion in total sales, down from $15.08 billion in 2022. Online sales made up 36% of total Nordstrom sales for the year.\n\nHowever, the company showed growth across the first three quarters of fiscal 2024:\n\nQ1: Net sales rose 5.1% year over year for the quarter ended May 4.\n\nQ2: Net sales increased 4% to $3.79 billion, with digital sales accounting for 37% of revenue, up from 36% the previous year.\n\nQ3: Net sales climbed 4.6% to $3.3 billion for the quarter ended Nov. 2. Digital sales grew 6.4%, with online successes particularly visible at Nordstrom Rack, according to the retailer.\n\nNordstrom Rack continues to play a key role in the company’s growth. Rack launched the option for buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS) at more than 100 locations in Q3. Since the start of fiscal 2024, Nordstrom has opened 23 Nordstrom Rack stores and plans to open at least 15 more in 2025.\n\nDo you rank in our databases?\n\nSubmit your data and we’ll see where you fit in our next ranking update.\n\nSign up\n\nStay on top of the latest developments in the online retail industry.

      "# [Nordstrom Family Nears Deal to Buy Company by Evan Clark on 2024-12-19](https://wwd.com/business-news/financial/nordstrom-family-liverpool-deal-nears-1236772463/)\nStory was updated at 5:17 p.m. EST on Dec. 19\n\nShares of Nordstrom Inc. rose 5.1 percent to $24.06 on Thursday after WWD reported that Erik and Pete were nearing a deal to buy the company founded by their great-grandfather.\n\nSources said the Nordstrom family and El Puerto de Liverpool could sign an agreement to take Nordstrom Inc. private as soon as this week.\n\nIf not, it’s understood that the process is being nudged toward a conclusion this year.\n\nNordstrom did not respond to WWD requests for comment.\n\nThe family and the Mexican retailer offered to buy Nordstrom for $23 a share, or $3.8 billion, in September — seven years after the Nordstroms tried to buy the company at $50 a share and were rejected.\n\nIt’s not clear just how the latest offer has evolved in negotiations with a special committee of the company’s board. But the initial bid revealed this fall was financed by rollover equity and cash commitments from the family and Liverpool as well as $250 million in new bank financing. Debt already carried by Nordstrom was envisioned staying in place.\n\nThe combination of the Nordstroms and Liverpool would be difficult to outbid as the family owns about a third of the company’s stock and Liverpool holds a nearly 10 percent stake.\n\nErik Nordstrom leads the business as chief executive officer and his brother Peter is president and chief brand officer, but taking the business private would give them a chance to reset the department store away from the prying eyes of Wall Street.\n\nThe retailer has long been known for its customer service and savvy merchandising, but like other department stores is searching for just the right mix for today’s landscape.\n\nFor the nine months ended Nov. 2 the company posted $128 million in net profits as sales increased 4.3 percent to $10.4 billion.\n\nErik Nordstrom told analysts last month: “In the third quarter, our efforts to enhance the customer experience continue to resonate, enabling growth in net and comparable sales, margin expansion and an increase in our customer base.\n\n“Both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack delivered 4 percent comparable sales growth. We’re particularly encouraged that our online business sustained its momentum with digital sales growth of over 6 percent. Customers responded to newness and our selection of the brands that matter most to them, driving positive total company net sales growth for the fourth consecutive quarter.”\n\nThe company is focusing on three priorities for the year — driving growth at the Nordstrom banner, optimizing operations and building on the momentum at the Rack.\n\n“As an omnichannel retailer, we have to be prepared to serve customers when, where and how they want to shop, and service is always our number-one priority,” the CEO said. “Our customers define what good service is, not us, and our teams are very focused on taking care of each and every customer who shop with us. We take this commitment to serving our customers seriously from the initial greeting, to providing assistance and a point of view at the fitting room, to completing the sale. For our customers that prefer to shop online, we aim to make the experience seamless and engaging through technology.”\n\nFor the full year, comparable sales growth is slated to rise by 1 to 2 percent.",

Both banners achieved a comparable sales growth of 4% and 3.9%.\n\nIn the earnings call, chief executive officer, director Erik Nordstrom noted that Rack is experiencing significant growth from the addition of new stores, which have become the primary driver of customer acquisition.\n\nDigital sales continued to show strength with a 6.4% increase, representing 34% of total sales during the quarter.\n\nIn the third quarter, the company expanded its Marketplace operations, which now features more than 300 sellers providing a diverse range of products to our customers.\n\nCategories such as women’s apparel and active saw double-digit growth, with shoes, men’s apparel, and kids’ wear also performing well at high single-digits. The company saw improved sequential growth in women’s apparel, shoes, and men’s apparel.\n\nThe company’s gross profit margin improved slightly to 35.6%, up from 35% last year, primarily driven by strong regular price sales. However, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) decreased to $83m from $102m during the same period in fiscal 2023.\n\nIncreased selling, general and administrative expenses were noted, rising to 36.6% of net sales due to higher labour costs and charges related to accelerated technology depreciation.\n\nDespite these challenges, Nordstrom ended the quarter with $1.2bn in available liquidity, including $397m in cash.\n\nNordstrom president Pete Nordstrom said: “Our third quarter results demonstrate that our strategic focus on curating a compelling brand assortment is resonating with customers.\n\n“Our actions throughout this year have led to this moment, and we feel well-positioned for a successful holiday season and look forward to helping our customers celebrate the moments that matter. I’m grateful to our dedicated team for consistently delivering the high level of service our customers have come to expect from Nordstrom.”\n\nFull year 2024 outlook:\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, Nordstrom forecasts flat to 1% growth in revenue range and expects comparable sales to grow between 1% and 2% versus fiscal 2023. It projects EPS in the range of $1.40 to $1.70 and an EBIT margin between 3 to 3.4% of sales.\n\nTo date in fiscal 2024, the company has opened 23 stores, ending the quarter with a total of 381 stores.\n\nIn March this year, the founding family behind Nordstrom reportedly sought to take the US department store operator private, a move that comes as no surprise to an industry analyst who believes the store has lost its “retail mojo” after facing mounting pressure from investors.\n\nNordstrom banner net sales increased 1.3% over the quarter.

This strategic shift may provide the flexibility needed to innovate and adapt in a rapidly changing market."
