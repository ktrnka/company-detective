Also as the other person said the lines are pretty long (mine only took me about 15 minutes to get through but it was still the longest I've ever seen there, but I went at like 3pm so maybe that helped?).\n\nSo I'd say if you have some time to kill and want to buy some items from a brand where you already know how it fits you then I'd say go for it, but otherwise I'd say skip it.\n\n### Comment ID fva2lti with +1 score by [(schrutefarms-, Reddit, 2020-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/hbnjud/is_it_worth_checking_out_the_in_store_nordstrom/fva2lti/) (in reply to ID fv9xeu6):\nOh I didn’t know it was final sale :/ \nI’m going to check it out.

I waited in line for an hour and a half to check out (I timed it), no line to get in. I sincerely felt *insanely* guilty about going inside, as this was the first day they’re open again in my state and I didn’t realize til I talked to an employee. But the sale is absolutely insane. I got Birkenstocks for $18, some $20 Nikes, and a bunch of amazing exercise gear for $10 apiece. 40% off *everything* is really a ridiculous steal. It is an *incredible* sale, it’s just necessary to be super patient and maybe scope out the store to see how the employees seem to be faring / how crowded it is before going in?\n\n### Comment ID fvb7ha4 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/hbnjud/is_it_worth_checking_out_the_in_store_nordstrom/fvb7ha4/) (in reply to ID fv9x49j):\n>  how crowded it is before going in?\n\nWere they not limiting the number of people where you are? I went to 3 different stores here and they were counting the number of people in an out - at one I had to wait like 2 minutes till someone left before I could enter.

Everything is on clearance plus an optional 40% off. If you opt out of the 40% off things are refundable, if you chose to go for the extra 40% off, it’s final sale. The one downside is that fitting rooms are closed so you kind of have to know your size if you want to get the 40% off due to final sale. The first day I waited in line for about two hours. It sucked. I did end up going back the next day with my brother so he could buy some clothes, probably waited about an hour this time. I did see people that came in pairs would have one person wait in line while the other one looked around. I personally thought it was a really good sale. To give you an idea of the sales my mom got a lot of quality clothes, pots etc (21 items total) for $160!! My brother got really nice sunglasses that were valued at $100, dress shoes, several pairs of button down shirts, several sweatpants/athletic clothes from champion/nike, and Nike slides for about $180. I got Quay sunglasses for $14.\n\n## Comment ID fvau1gw with +3 score by [(Cheapthrills96, Reddit, 2020-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/hbnjud/is_it_worth_checking_out_the_in_store_nordstrom/fvau1gw/) (in reply to ID hbnjud):\nI went.

Like I got 2 Reformation dresses - $22 & $30, $12 Born booties that I have in another color, paid $130 for, Boss silk blouse $25, Vince silk blouse $30, Ted Baker WOC $30, CK suit $36, I can’t even remember what else. I got several things that I had also ordered recently - going to return those and keep the super cheap ones I got now!

I’m pretty sure brands like Madewell and Topshop and Reformation don’t make clothes for NR specifically, so there’s a good chance those are the real quality. However, it’s kind of difficult to find garments from those brands that aren’t....kind of ugly. The reason they’re usually found at NR is because they were unpopular and didn’t sell.

They don’t ever seem to have a big enough range in the store to suggest so, it’s almost always a very small selection of what seem like leftovers. It also wouldn’t really be their brand to do that. It’s usually because they didn’t sell, but the good stuff I’ve found has been out of season. Like, I found a nice topshop sweater during summer. It’s really just a crapshoot.

I work for a fashion brand that's sold in Nordstrom and I can guarantee that anything you find at Rack from us is the real deal.  Building out an entirely different and cheaper manufacturing process just to sell at Rack at a lower cost wouldn't be economically practical for us.  \n\nUsually when I find things at Rack from our brand, it's from the past season, whereas what is found in Nordstrom's is the current season.  For example, we're a denim focused brand, so you'll currently find lots of washes from the summer in Rack right now, whereas Nordstroms is only selling from our fall/winter collection. \n\nI can only speak for my brand, but I imagine it is a similar situation for others as well.\n\n### Comment ID f5xhivq with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5xhivq/) (in reply to ID f5xdpgm):\nThanks you for this information.

There is no Burberry made for Nordstrom Rack that will share the same label.

The quality is usually the same especially in denim. The only thing to be cautious of is the clearance items as they often do have defects like a weird cut or length. I really recommend trying everything on before purchasing. I also don’t recommend Madewell denim as it seems to not be of good quality from my own personal experience. I’d recommend Paige, Hudson, or even Joe’s jeans, as they are of good quality and have been long lasting for me.\n\n### Comment ID f6r8mj3 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-11-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f6r8mj3/) (in reply to ID f6puctl):\nThank you for the info.

Lots of bloggers and Insta - Influencers make a big deal about their Nordi semi-annual sale hauls. You can get some amazing deals if you find items you want at Nordstrom, add them to your wishlist on the app or website, or just keep them in your cart and then when the semi-annual sale comes the discounts will be automatically applied. Of course, it really pays to be a rewards member and/or a card holder because you get access to the semi-annual sale earlier than others. The rewards membership is free and all you have to do is enter your phone number anytime you shop to get \"notes\" and they're pretty easy to get and redeem. \n\nPlus, personal preference, but Nordstrom stores are just the nicest. The layout is consistent and its design team just does such a nice job of making sure the space is open, airy, classy, bright and comfortable. I also think Nordstrom has the best options for makeup and fragrance. It is the only one that carries Jo Malone outside of Sephora in the U.S. which is my favorite fragrance brand. \n\nNordstrom just makes the in-person shopping experience feel really nice. They offer a free personal shopping experience which I have never done but would love to do where you go in and you tell them your size and style and they will pull pieces and curate some looks for you and the only thing you pay is what you end up buying. Its those little services that make a difference in my book.\n\n### Comment ID gzghcrz with +6 score by [(loi_, Reddit, 2021-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/gzghcrz/) (in reply to ID gzfnmw0):\nThank you for this!

In my experience (though I’m definitely not a major fashion expert, I have lived and shopped in a few different cities) Bloomingdales is equivalent with Macy’s. Nordstrom is a lot better than both. Saks is definitely the most expensive and definitely does have some higher quality items, but you’re going to be paying for it.\n\nI like Nordstrom the best personally. Even if I was an independently wealthy millionaire, I’m pretty sure that I’d chose to shop with them. Their return policy rocks. If you have a card (maybe even if you don’t, I’m not sure) they give you credits for free alterations which can be really awesome if you find something that you love but doesn’t fit you just right. \n\nI’ve never bothered to do it, but you can call and give a general or specific list of things that you’re looking for (like vacation wear, casual stuff, something to wear to a friend or relatives wedding events, etc). A shopper will get a lot of stuff together and put it aside so that it’s ready for you to look over and try on when you show up. You don’t have to buy any of it either.\n\nWhen I’ve went in just to browse and tried something on, the salesperson always offered to bring me other things if what I had didn’t work. If I said no thanks and didn’t buy anything, they were still friendly and sweet. \n\nIdk, I’ve been to other places where I couldn’t walk for 5 minutes before someone new dying to sell me something would just pop out. I hated that, and haven’t experienced it at nordys. I sound like some kind of company ambassador 😂 🤣\n\n#### Comment ID gzgghig with +6 score by [(Gilmoregirlin, Reddit, 2021-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/gzgghig/) (in reply to ID gzg3dd5):\nI like Nordstrom because they hem things for free and I am short, so long as they are full price.  I live in the DC area and we used to have one Bloomies that was in White Flint (closed) which was like Macy’s but the one we have now which is in Friendship heights is very high end like Saks, people are super snotty in there!

Many Nordstrom stores in my area even have Gucci/Chanel/Prada boutiques literally built into the store. Especially recently with Nordstrom running really good business and transforming their strategy to be more modern with covid, I’m convinced people who place Bloomingdales over Nordstrom haven’t stepped foot in either in years.\n\n## Comment ID gzg8p9p with +6 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-05-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/gzg8p9p/) (in reply to ID nkrqd6):\nTIL I need to renew my Nordstrom credit card.\n\n## Comment ID gzim99p with +3 score by [(throwitawayinashoebx, Reddit, 2021-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/gzim99p/) (in reply to ID nkrqd6):\nIn my experience, nordstrom is the most accessible of the 3 (in terms of pricing), saks is the least accessible. I've only been inside one true saks once, so i can't comment on that shopping experience, but i definitely prefer shopping at nordstrom over Bloomingdale's. And the nordstrom shoe store is the best out of the 3.\n\nHonestly, I'm at the point where if i need something, i typically check just nordstrom first to see what's available at what price points before i branch out to other stores. It just has everything, the returns policy is excellent, the bathrooms are better maintained and better lit, they do some alterations for you, and their in-store restaurant is better than Bloomingdale's.\n\n## Comment ID h2vikv7 with +2 score by [(vegaslivin26, Reddit, 2021-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/h2vikv7/) (in reply to ID nkrqd6):\nThey’re basically the same. Bloomingdale’s is Macy’s. It’s the same company. You’re paying for their overpriced Macy’s crap. Nordstrom you get their house brands which include actually decent merchandise that have been around for decades as well as the customer service that goes along with it. Neiman’s probably is considered the more exclusive department store in terms of brands carried, but Nordstrom actually does have the exact same depending on your location. Saks is equivalent to Neiman’s but with shorter in person hours & terrible service. I personally look at how many places have discount chain versions of their stores. They all do minus Neiman’s. That should help you if you want to rank by exclusivity.\n\n### Comment ID k471nnq with +2 score by [(Primary_Mirror_3504, Reddit, 2023-10-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/k471nnq/) (in reply to ID h2vikv7):\nMacy's is in the middle as far as high-end to low-end.

You walk around the aisle - and no dice. And of course it is the only one in your size.

I asked target to call the other targets and ask about them in my size. No dice. Some employees got involved and really tried to help but the shoe was MIA. They said they would make a note and \"put it in the computer\" but I had given up hope at that point. Target called me like 3 weeks later. They had found another single shoe of this style in my size with a cracked side (the white and black plastic piece that runs around the edge of the shoe) in a store 9 hours away and asked if I wanted to have it sent up? So I did. When I got the lost shoe it was beat to hell and they said it had been lodged under a storage rack in the back room of the other location.

There’s three different things that lead to this:\n\n* Customers trying on one shoe. Customers will often pull a shoe from the box, drop it on the ground to try it on, and then not put it back. Corporate laid off our only full time shoe employee, so we would do what we could, which meant picking up all the shoes all over the floor and then trying to match them later on. So the pair could be in our back room waiting for a match. You can always ask someone to check on it for you!\n\n* Cashiers not checking to make sure we’re selling pairs. We had a whole pile of shoes that were two lefts or pairs that were half or whole size different. How people never came back after they realized they had two left Ugg boots, I don’t know. The half and whole sizes are, I’m assuming, from customers with two different size feet who get away with purchasing two shoes that fit them, leaving us with two shoes that are different sizes. \n\n* Theft. Our store tagged the right shoes. If you stole a left shoe and then went over to Nordstrom rack or another store that sold the same brands, you might be able to find a left right shoe that was uncensored, so you’d have stolen a pair of shoes without and risk of trying to disable a sensor or having the alarms go off.\n\nThere are some shoes that are possibly in the black hole of nothingness where all lost things go. I haven’t worked at Saks in almost a year, but I imagine they’ve still got the wall of mismates stacked up, filled with lonely shoes):\n\n### Comment ID erbuurf with +28 score by [(PrincessFuckFace2You, Reddit, 2019-06-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/c146bn/do_you_ever_feel_like_you_are_getting_punked_at/erbuurf/) (in reply to ID erbihc6):\nUgg boots are the worst for this type of stuff, I think because they are so shapeless.

If they hadn’t sold within another month, then we damaged them out, which means we sent them back to the warehouse that sends us our shipments. From there, who knows? \n\nMy store laid off about all of our full time employees outside of managers, so we had way too much work and not enough hours or manpower. We rarely ever got around to discounting and then damaging out mismates.

I've worked at the rack, in the shoe department, and have spent hours looking for those lost shoe mates. We have bins and racks of single shoes in the back. Working in shoes was probably one of my least favorite jobs of all time. Once you think you've found one, then you see another single shoe on the ground, or discarded pairs of shoes someone has strewn all across the aisle. Then you have armfuls of single shoes franticly running up and down aisles and visually scanning every box for the matches to your couple dozen different shoes. So, girls and guys (but mostly girls-women's shoes was always the worst!), if you want to be able to find that pair of shoes you like, put away the shoes you try on, together, back in the box, and on the right shelf. Many people don't put the shoes they try on away, they just leave them on the floor to get trampled, mixed up, and scattered. Now if there was just one person shopping, fine the retail staff could maybe handle that, but no there are hundreds, even thousands of people on a busy day that come through a big store, and no retail employee has the time to pick up after adult sized toddlers. There is a solution to this problem, but it mostly relies on customers being nice people so it's probably not going to happen.

      "# Post ID i7wd1s: I assumed being sold at Nordstrom meant a brand was a high-quality, luxury brand. Turns out Nordstrom.com is just a marketplace (like Amazon or Walmart.com) where anybody can sell. with +103 score by [(e925, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/)\n**Edit: Ok not ANYBODY who wants to sell there can sell there. But they aren’t as choosy and bougie as one might think. The takeaway is this: If you, like me, equate the name “Nordstrom” with high-quality, luxury brands (like Nordstrom used to carry exclusively), that is no longer the case.** \n\n**Because something has been sold at Nordstrom Rack (like Byroe), it does not mean it was once sold at Nordstrom and just went on clearance. Just because something is sold at Nordstrom (or Nordstrom Rack), it no longer should imply quality or luxury, like my poor-person brain thought it still did. Oh, and don’t pick the Byroe serum. The ingredients are terrible.**\n\nI recently saw a post about how Grace & Stella (an admitted private label company) is now selling their products at Nordstrom. \n\nThis made me remember the times that I’ve questioned a brand’s legitimacy, only to be reassured of their quality when I saw the products were available to purchase at Nordstrom (a luxury retailer).\n\nI once saw somebody comment that the Byroe toner was Boxycharm including a product with an artificially inflated price point, and I defended them by saying, “This is not the same as the $90 brush set situation. They sell Byroe at Nordstrom. $90 is the actual price.”\n\n~~I alsowondered why I had never heard of Malin + Goetz before seeing them in beauty boxes, but when I looked them up, I saw that they were for sale at Nordstrom.com. This led me to believe that Malin + Goetz is a prestige brand.~~\n\nBut when it was brought to my attention that Grace & Stella was being sold at Nordstrom.com, I was like whaaa...? \n\nI know for a fact that Grace & Stella is not a luxury brand. I’m not saying that all private labeling is bad - but when I think of a product being sold at Nordstrom, I assume it’s on par with Jo Malone, Khiel’s, Dior, etc., which I know Grace & Stella is *not*. \n\nSo I did some research, and it turns out [anybody can sell](https://www.acenda.com/content/sell-on-nordstrom) at Nordstrom.com. That’s why I couldn’t find Byroe ~~or Malin + Goetz~~ for sale anywhere else.\n\nJust a PSA, in case anybody else was still looking at Nordstrom as a luxury retailer, aka from a 1990s point of view.\n\nEdit: ok so I was wrong about Malin + Goetz (it shows up at other retailers if you search for that retailer specifically), but I’m doubling down on Byroe. Take today’s Boxycharm choice of [Tomato Serum](https://byroe.com/products/tomato-serum).  The first four ingredients are cheap moisturizers and fillers, and the 5th ingredient is alcohol. Tomato extract is the 47th out of 48 ingredients. With an RV of $150/Oz.\n\n## Comment ID g14hf56 with +56 score by [(luckycat03, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14hf56/) (in reply to ID i7wd1s):\nI agree with your comments about Byroe and especially Grace & Stella but imo Malin + Goetz is a reputable albeit overpriced brand.

Former Nordstrom corporate employee here. This isn't exactly true. Nordstrom doesn't let just anyone sell products like Amazon or Walmart.  Nordstrom does have a drop ship program, but a vendor still has to pass through a process and a buyer has to want the merchandise. [This list that was referenced](https://www.nordstrom.com/browse/nordstrom-cares/partnership-guidelines) is customer facing, it is definitely not all of the requirements for becoming a drop ship partner. This is a broad overview for curious people. They are not going to state \"you must be a luxury brand\" explicitly on a customer facing page, they are more about creating the \"atmosphere\" of luxury or if they state that a brand is luxury it's usually with a euphemism or about how something feels. I know that their image is what is keeping them afloat in this brutal retail world so I don't think they would throw that away to become an online marketplace.\n\nThey are probably selling Grace and Stella because, as someone else mentioned, they are hype right now, and Nordstrom wanted to cash in on that. Grace and Stella's marketing team is much smarter than face skin's; they have a much better image. I agree that this was a miss for them, and I doubt they would have agreed to the partnership if they knew they were alibaba crap. Nordstrom sold Goop gemstones for like $80 that were \"blessed\" by someone named Heather. They want to jump on trends.\n\n### Comment ID g15i8sa with +3 score by [(pounce_the_panther, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g15i8sa/) (in reply to ID g14xn25):\nAll of the Grace and Stella items I can find are in the Pop Up shop.

Thanks for taking the time to give your input. \n\nI guess my point was this - I was excited for the Byroe toner because I saw it at Nordstrom Rack. \n\nI thought all products at Nordstrom Rack were products that were once sold at Nordstrom and had gone on clearance, so I used the fact that the Byroe toner was on clearance “for $29.97 from $95” [at Nordstrom Rack](https://www.nordstromrack.com/shop/product/3115305/byroe-bitter-green-essence-toner?color=GREEN) as clear evidence that Byroe is a legitimate luxury brand, and the Byroe toner was once sold at Nordstrom proper for $95. \n\nI’m probably not the only person here who thought the Nordstrom name was equivalent to a legitimate product. \n\nIt says 86% off, which gives the impression to me, an un-savvy shopper, that Nordstrom buyers think the Byroe toner is worth $95, because Nordstrom at one point “carried it.” \n\nDoes that make sense? I used the Nordstrom name as evidence of Byroe’s legitimacy when in conversation with others, but I now realize that that was not a valid argument. \n\nThe Byroe Tomato serum is a choice for a Boxy Premium today (and the ingredients are not worth $150), so I still think the post is important, just in case a fellow un-savvy shopper mistakenly assumed that Byroe = Nordstrom = Quality, when it does not mean that in the same way that it used to.\n\n#### Comment ID g15t78k with +15 score by [(Ditovontease, Reddit, 2020-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g15t78k/) (in reply to ID g15cll9):\nNever assume Rack is the same as Nordstrom. It's well known that TJ Maxx and other \"outlet\" type places will stock items from prestige brands but often those items were made SPECIFICALLY to go to TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack and are made far more cheaply than items that are carried at actual Nordstrom.

Malin + Goetz is definitely a legit brand, they are sold at a lot of the major retailers for years. They also have been supplying products to a lot of luxury hotels etc. so it fits that top tier status, in my opinion. It might not be a brand targeted to a young demographic so I don't think they do a lot of social media marketing. You can find them on Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, Sephora, Saks Fifth, their own boutiques and other retailers too. \n2. IDK about Byroe, since I am not interested in their products and haven't come across them.\n3. Grace & Stella is a brand, a millenial/gen-z/IG hyped up brand, that is. I haven't done my research but I would assume Nordstrom sells them because of their following, their \"aesthetic\" and their clout. LOL. So people who are interested in the brand would drive traffic to Nordstrom and perhaps buy other products from Nordstrom too, which gives them more money. Grace & Stella is a brand disguising as a luxury brand... They have good marketers and brand relationship managers to be honest, being able to get this far. Props to them.\n4. To your point, yes you are correct Grace & Stella is not a luxury brand when you compare it to Chanel, Dior and other brands being sold at Nordstrom. However, I also don't think Nordstrom = Walmart, Amazon where it's a free for all marketplace. I'm sure the brands go through an approval process where both parties benefit from the exposure and sales they get from Nordstrom. That's why there is no Wet & Wild or LA Girl there. Grace & Stella sells their stuff on a higher price point than drugstore and are aligning themselves to the likes of Saturday Skin, Youth to the People, Herbivore and other cutesy packaging, millenial reaching skincare brands *hence maybe why* you also see them at Nordstrom.\n\n### Comment ID g14nvrt with +19 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14nvrt/) (in reply to ID g14lg38):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID g14qpad with +11 score by [(biancae1izabeth, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14qpad/) (in reply to ID g14nvrt):\nYeah I'm with you!

Anyone who has had their images stolen by Alibaba and wish sellers knows that the product you're getting is RARELY the same thing as is shown in the picture. The picture is almost always a higher quality item that the cheap wholesale seller is duping. If you want to find instances of this, just take a look at simplynailogical's 500 videos about stolen content on wish - it is a huge problem especially for smaller brands and unknown creators to have their content stolen by online retailers because they have very little excess cash and legal backing to get them taken down. \n\n2 the items that YOU buy off alibaba, even if it seems to be the exact same product as something else, are rarely the same product a private labeler is buying. Private label companies don't log into alibaba and buy a bulk inventory and then repackage the goods. They contact a factory to have items specifically made for their order, often already with their private label on them or entirely unlabeled so that the company can brand them themselves and repackage in higher quality packaging. You can see this with practically all the hair accessories you can buy at any major retailer across the US. It is the same stuff with a different name on it. Theres only so many ways to make a Bobby pin! Private labelers dont automatically have bad quality just because they private label, they're just rebranding existing products and sometimes that product is crap and sometimes it isnt. A huge, well known private labeling company you all know and love is Trader Joe's. The majority of their products are existing products made by other brands relabeled for trader Joe's, sometimes with slight variations just so the trader Joe's one has a different ingredient list. Sometimes they just change the names on the ingredients even so you cant find their dupes, like using the chemical name for banana extract instead of just saying \"banana extract\". There is a big difference between you buying skincare from wish and the brand buying their original unlabeled product, #1 being when they import things to the US under their new private label, their stock is all going to be identical, whereas if you buy two of the exact same items off wish you could end up with two totally different products. Thats because Even private labelers have quality control. I think there is a lot of confusion about this especially on this app because of the one major private label scandal we all know that came up and now everyone thinks all private labelers are trying to poison us, but one of the reasons that story got so big is because they weren't just private labeling, they were doing it very badly and not doing proper quality control, which was the only reason anyone even knew they were a private labeler. Had they done a great job, you probably never would have known. Other private labelers will do everything they can not to make the same mistakes, because they dont want a scandal to marr their brands. Dls probably spends more trying to dig out of the pit from their scandal than they do on any other marketing by creating new brands all the time. They Have to make new brands to survive. No other brand wants to be in the same shoes as dls.\n\n3 almost all products' retail value are roughly 10% material cost, 10% packaging, 20% marketing, and 60% profit margin. The marketing they do isnt always to consumers. They also have to market to retailers to get them to carry their products\n\n4 luxury brands produce products in china too. Everyone does. Huge workforce, low labor and infrastructure costs. It just makes sense if you want to drive your costs down as much as possible. If they're not producing out of china it is from Indonesia, Thailand, anywhere they can drive the wages into the dirt. Some (not all!!! But some!!) Comments about chinese produced goods are borderline xenophobic without really considering that it isnt China, but the US that creates the horrible factory conditions and encourages costs to be cut as low as possible. Chinese factories have to compete with eachother for US brands to pick them, they're not just jerks trying to screw over one another. They're responding to the market factors created by US industry\n\nSorry I just kinda went off a bit but every time I see posts saying \"tHis bRAnD is alIBabA TrASh\" I go into angry-supply-chain-explanation-mode and my eyes turn red. \n\nAlso, why do people think Nordstrom is luxury? It seems just like any department store to me, is there some sort of department store hierarchy I dont know about? Where is Von Marr on the hierarchy? Because they're my favorite. They have nursing rooms with rocking chairs so I think they're the coolest\n\nAlso also, I too loved to swipe the malin and goetz from the hotel when leaving.

They are usually around $20 retail I think at full-price. They \\*are\\* cheap looking dresses, but they aren't pretending at luxury here. These are items on super clearance at Nordstom's discount outlet, they probably just want them out the door. Since the clothes are manufactured by Nordstrom, they can either sell NPG items at a higher markup (which you can find in full price stores, with better materials) or at a lower price (at rack). Nordstrom tries to be pretty careful with their overseas manufacturers, but they are still overseas manufacturers. They are probably still turning a low profit on these dresses or selling them at cost (I have seen clearances lose money because I have seen markups, but this is probably not that). So there is something to be said about the ethics of a profitable $5 dress, but probably for a different subreddit.\n\n## Comment ID g14kxv9 with +4 score by [(radbu107, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14kxv9/) (in reply to ID i7wd1s):\nTo add to this, what do you guys think about Oryza eyeshadow that is offered through Ipsy?

I found some eyeshadow [palettes ](https://imgur.com/a/tXlMfoJ) on Aliexpress which don’t have the exact same shades, but look very similar.

To us, it's \"you're gonna get such a good deal!\" whereas to brands it's \"you're going to get so many loyal customers by selling at an initial discount!\"\n\nIt's optional to believe this part of my post here as I can't back up in-person experiences with receipts, but: I actually met with a small brand founder whose products had been featured in a beauty box. This founder told me that they got a LOT of reviews from this move but not a lot of sales. Which...I could have guessed that part. But said founder was truly surprised by this.\n\nOf course you all know that we sub to boxes for deals, not for loyalty per say (or I'm speaking personally lol, I'll switch brands based on better prices!) \n\nNow with Byroe, my experience is more limited - but from my interactions, I'd say they really are aiming for a luxury brand (it's not Alibaba repackaged). Are their prices absurd? I mean...what luxury brand isn't? La Mer? ReVive? The price tags are goofy to me as someone who uses The Ordinary. But it's still in line with other luxury, and the experience is definitely in line with those brands as well.\n\nSo tbh I was surprised to see Byroe in Boxy but I've got two possible conclusions: either they hope to gain more popularity or they're selling their products at a markdown to maintain freshness (which is actually great, the brand is pretty young).\n\n## Comment ID g14g4sv with +2 score by [(e925, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14g4sv/) (in reply to ID i7wd1s):\nNo pun intended with the Point of View comment 😂\n\n## Comment ID g14m7lx with +2 score by [(MariposaSunrise, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14m7lx/) (in reply to ID i7wd1s):\nI usually use Sephora as my test to see if it is a high quality luxury brand.\n\n### Comment ID g14q21y with +5 score by [(e925, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14q21y/) (in reply to ID g14m7lx):\nFor sure - there are a lot of good brands at Ulta too!

      "# Post ID h9y3ub: Nordstrom App tip and share your best shopping tips as well! with +253 score by [(quietisland, Reddit, 2020-06-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/h9y3ub/nordstrom_app_tip_and_share_your_best_shopping/)\nSince Nordstrom has been having a ton of really good sales - well kinda non-stop since March, just wanted to share some notes about the wish list features they have. Start by making a wishlist or two. I suggest making two wishlists, one for your actual regular shopping, and one that includes anything you want to track. Then in the app, turn on \"Notify me when an item goes on sale or comes back in stock.\"\n\nThen, Nordstrom sends you a notification when anything on your list(s) get reduced in price. And the 'back in stock' is a game changer during clearance time. When people cancel their orders, or stock was updated in a store and added back to inventory, you get a notification. I have picked up a few items I missed the first time thanks to this second one. \n\nNordstrom Rack as of now does not have this feature, but fingers crossed moving forward. \n\nI think shopbop is supposed to do the same with your hearts and lists, but I have only received emails about my cart from them, so I am not sure what the deal is. I do love how your hearts becomes a custom catalog though, so I am not complaining. :)\n\nDo you have any tips for shopping your fave store?

As the Sperry site only stocks specific (Mostly newer) styles.\n\nEdit: Newer Sperry skus start with 'STS' so you should be able to type that SKU number into the search feature on the site and find it.\n\n### Comment ID eyryu2y with +8 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/eyryu2y/) (in reply to ID eyrt7kf):\nThank you I'll have to try this\n\n## Comment ID eyrc4ch with +68 score by [(Dacyco, Reddit, 2019-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/eyrc4ch/) (in reply to ID cybu0w):\nIt is also possible that the shoes you bought at Nordstrom Rack are a much older model no longer sold in their website.\n\n### Comment ID eyrfpe8 with +15 score by [(meriendaselgato, Reddit, 2019-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/eyrfpe8/) (in reply to ID eyrc4ch):\nThat's my guess–  the style was made this season at a different factory and the ones she got were from a past season.

We'll get a like 20-min crash course on what to do. Find the return slip, look up the order, find the item being returned, credit the customer, throw it in a bag and send the item off to Inspections. \n\nWe are held to strict time standards and get less than 5 minutes to process each return. At that point, all we're looking for is the brand, size and color to match what was bought. So unless it's something glaringly obvious, like a different color, then any authenticity differences are not going to be noticed.\n\nThe next department (Inspections), checks to see how worn/damaged the item is, (but still isn't really trained much on signs of authenticity). \nAnd they get even less time @ literally 50 seconds per piece. \nThe running joke there is to just \"close your eyes and fold.\" \n\nOtherwise, actually inspecting the piece, lint rolling, cleaning, even buttoning it up, etc. takes up too much time. If you don't find a way to meet the time standards, eventually you'll lose your job. For most people, that way is to just not look too closely. \nI feel very bad about the quality they secondhand force us to send back out with the lousy time standards. I always say I don't hate the customer enough to work in Returns full time. \n\nAnyway, after inspecting, the piece is marked \"Good\" or \"Poor\". If it's \"Good\", it will go back to stock.\n\nIf it's \"Good\" but out of season, (since we accept returns from 100 years ago), it will then go to...boom, Nordstrom Rack. \n\nWe process tens of thousands of orders per day. I think the record right now is almost 40k in a day. \n\nSo, yeahhh totally possible. \n¯\\_(;--;)_/¯\n\n### Comment ID eysioy4 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-09-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/eysioy4/) (in reply to ID eysh8ft):\nThank you for the insight!\n\n### Comment ID f24sjcy with +1 score by [(mitch8893, Reddit, 2019-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/f24sjcy/) (in reply to ID eysh8ft):\nI am curious..

I bought them from $7 to $60. Occasionally you also see Todd Snyder.\n\nAs for shoes, the rack carries the Converse Chuck 70 pretty cheap. I was able to buy one last January for about $27. Red Wings are pretty hard to come by at the rack these days.

GMV increased 1.1 percent. The timing shift of the Anniversary Sale had a positive impact on Nordstrom banner net sales of approximately 200 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNordstrom Rack banner net sales increased 8.8 percent and comparable sales increased 4.1 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2023.\n\nDigital sales increased 6.2 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2023. The timing shift of the Anniversary Sale had a positive impact on Company digital sales of approximately 100 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2023. Digital sales represented 37 percent of total sales during the quarter.\n\nGross profit, as a percentage of net sales, of 36.6 percent increased 155 basis points compared with the same period in fiscal 2023, primarily due to strong regular price sales and leverage on higher total sales.\n\nEnding inventory increased 8.3 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2023, versus a 3.4 percent increase in sales.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses, as a percentage of net sales, of 34.4 percent increased 160 basis points compared with the same period in fiscal 2023, due to a charge primarily related to supply chain asset impairment and a 2023 gain on the sale of a real estate asset, partially offset by leverage on higher sales. Excluding the $54 million charge primarily related to supply chain asset impairment, adjusted SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 33.0 percent.\n\nEBIT was $190 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared with $192 million during the same period in fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBIT of $244 million excluded the charge primarily related to supply chain asset impairment.2\n\nInterest expense, net, of $26 million was flat compared with $26 million during the same period in fiscal 2023.\n\nIncome tax expense was $42 million, or 25.7 percent of pretax earnings, compared with income tax expense of $29 million, or 17.2 percent of pretax earnings, in the same period in fiscal 2023. The increase in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was driven primarily by the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nThe Company ended the second quarter with $1.5 billion in available liquidity, including $679 million in cash.\n\nSTORES UPDATE\n\nTo date in fiscal 2024, the Company has opened eleven stores:\n\nThe Company has also announced plans to open the following stores:\n\nThe Company had the following store counts as of quarter-end:\n\nFISCAL YEAR 2024 OUTLOOK\n\nThe Company updated its financial outlook for fiscal 2024, which also now reflects the charge primarily related to supply chain asset impairment and related tax impacts recorded in the second quarter, as well as estimated accelerated technology depreciation impacts expected in the second half of fiscal 2024:\n\nRevenue range, including retail sales and credit card revenues, of 1.0 percent decline to 1.0 percent growth versus the 53-week fiscal 2023, which includes an approximately 135 basis point unfavorable impact from the 53rd week\n\nComparable sales range of flat to 2.0 percent growth versus 52 weeks in fiscal 2023\n\nEBIT margin of 3.0 to 3.4 percent of sales\n\nAdjusted EBIT margin of 3.6 to 4.0 percent of sales3\n\nIncome tax rate of approximately 27 percent\n\nEPS of $1.40 to $1.70, excluding the impact of share repurchase activity, if any\n\nAdjusted EPS of $1.75 to $2.05, excluding the impact of share repurchase activity, if any3\n\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\n\nThe Company's senior management will host a conference call to provide a business update and to discuss second quarter 2024 financial results and fiscal 2024 outlook at 4:45 p.m. EDT today.

      "# [Nordstrom by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2003-04-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom)\nAmerican luxury department store chain\n\nThis article is about the department store chain. For other uses, see Nordstrom (disambiguation).\n\nNordstrom, Inc. ( ) is an American luxury department store chain headquartered in Seattle, Washington, and founded by John W. Nordstrom and Carl F. Wallin in 1901. The original store operated exclusively as a shoe store, and a second location opened in 1923. The growing chain began selling clothing in 1963, and became the full-line retailer that presently exists by 1971. The company founded its off-price Nordstrom Rack division in 1973, and grew both full-line and off-price divisions throughout the United States in the following years. The full-line division competes with department stores including Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, and Saks Fifth Avenue, while the off-price division competes with retailers including the TJX Companies and Ross Stores.[4] Previous expansions beyond the contiguous United States include Puerto Rico (2015–2020) and Canada (2014–2023).\n\nEarly history\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn W. Nordstrom was born on February 15, 1871, in the village Alvik near Luleå in Northern Sweden.[5] In 1887, Nordstrom immigrated to the United States at the age of 16.[5][6] His name at birth was Johan Wilhelm Nordström (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈjuːhɑn ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈnuːr(d)strœm]), which he later anglicized to John W. Nordstrom. After landing in New York, he began working in Michigan and was able to save enough money to purchase a 20-acre (81,000 m2) potato farm in Arlington, Washington.[5] In 1897, he joined the Klondike Gold Rush in Canada's Yukon Territory. After two years of prospecting, he finally struck gold, but sold his disputed claim for $13,000.[5] Returning to Seattle with his newfound wealth, he married Hilda Carlson in 1900 and searched for a business venture.[5]\n\nOperations during 20th century\n\n[edit]\n\nWallin & Nordstrom and Nordstrom Best\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom eventually settled on a shoe store that opened in 1901, called Wallin & Nordstrom.[6] Carl F. Wallin, the co-founder of the store, was the owner of the adjacent shoe repair shop.[5] John and Hilda had five children, three of whom would follow him into the family business, Everett W. (1903), Elmer J. (1904) and Lloyd N. Nordstrom.[7][8]\n\nIn 1928, John W. Nordstrom retired and sold his shares to two of his sons, Everett and Elmer. In 1929, Wallin also retired and sold his shares to them. The 1930 grand opening of the remodeled Second Avenue store marked the change of name to Nordstrom. Lloyd Nordstrom subsequently joined the company in 1933, and the three brothers ran the business together for almost forty years.[9]\n\nBy 1958, Nordstrom had expanded to eight stores in two states but still sold only shoes. Apparel came with its purchase of Best's Apparel of Seattle in 1963, and the company's name was changed to Nordstrom Best.[10]\n\nFollowing renaming to Nordstrom\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1971, the company was taken public on National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ). It was one of the first companies to be listed on the then-newly established stock exchange.[11] It was moved to the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 under the ticker symbol JWN after John W. Nordstrom, its founder.[10]\n\nTheir business continued beyond stores in 1974. On December 5, the National Football League announced the signing of a franchise agreement that would put a team in Seattle, Washington. Representing the family as majority partner of the consortium was Lloyd W. Nordstrom. However, he would never see a game as owner, as he died of a heart attack on January 20, 1976, eight months before the newly christened Seattle Seahawks took the field.[12] With his death, the estate of Mr. Nordstrom would oversee the team, with co-owner and entrepreneur Herman Sarkowsky serving as the team's first chief operating officer.[13][14]\n\nBy 1975, Nordstrom expanded into Alaska (the only time by acquisition) by purchasing Northern Commercial Company and opened its first Nordstrom Rack clearance store in Seattle. A strong northwest regional retailer with sales already approaching $250 million making it the third-largest specialty retailer in the United States, the company opened its first Southern California store at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa in 1978.[15] By the early 1990s, it had opened 26 stores plus Racks in California. Subsequent expansion relied on creating a strongly decentralized regional structure, beginning with the Northeast in the Tysons Corner Center in Virginia (1988), the Midwest in the Oakbrook Center in Illinois (1991), the Southeast in Atlanta (1998), and the Southwest in Dallas (1996). In a new region, the initial store was used as a base for training and recruitment for subsequent expansion, and was usually backed by its own distribution center. From 1978 to 1995, Nordstrom opened a total of 46 full-line department stores.[16]\n\nIn 1976, Nordstrom opened a series of stores called Place Two to sell a more limited selection of apparel in smaller markets. By 1983, there were ten Place Two stores, but the cost of upgrading the smaller stores, especially from a systems perspective, outweighed the benefit, and the division was discontinued.[17] The last two remaining Place Two stores closed on April 1, 1995.[18] In August 1988, the Nordstroms sold the Seahawks to real estate developer Ken Behring and his partner Ken Hofmann for $80 million.[19][20][21]\n\nThe company also expanded into direct sales in 1993, beginning with a catalog division[22] led by John N.'s son Dan that was followed by an e-commerce business. Nordstrom.com's fulfillment and contact centers are located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Seattle, Washington. Currently, it has distribution centers in Ontario, California; Newark, California; Portland, Oregon; Dubuque, Iowa; Upper Marlboro, Maryland; and Gainesville, Florida.\n\nNordstrom FSB, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nordstrom, Inc., is a federally chartered savings bank doing business as Nordstrom Bank. It was formed in 1991 in Scottsdale, Arizona, with its customer contact center in Centennial, Colorado. Nordstrom FSB was formerly known as Nordstrom National Credit Bank and changed its name to Nordstrom FSB in March 2000. The bank offers various banking and credit products, such as Nordstrom Signature VISA, Nordstrom retail credit and debit cards, interest-bearing checking accounts, check cards, and certificates of deposits. It offers Nordstrom customers cards under Nordstrom Rewards – its customer loyalty program – where customers earn points when making purchases with the card at Nordstrom and other retailers.\n\nIn 1995, Nordstrom opened their first store location in New York State.[23] It is located at The Westchester, an upscale shopping mall in White Plains, New York, a suburb of New York City. Nordstrom has since opened stores at Roosevelt Field in Garden City, New York in 1997,[24] and Manhattan in 2019.[25]\n\nBeginning in 1995, the fourth generation of brothers and cousins had been co-presidents for a time. John Whitacre was appointed as the first non-Nordstrom CEO in 1997.[26] In 1998, Nordstrom replaced its downtown Seattle store with a new flagship location in the former Frederick & Nelson building across the street. A two-year renovation of this location was completed in 2016.[27] At 383,000 square feet (35,600 m2), the downtown Seattle location is the chain's largest store. By contrast, the smallest Nordstrom store, as of September 2008, opened in 1980 in Salem, Oregon, with a total area of just under 72,000 square feet (6,700 m2). This location has since closed.\n\nIn 1998, Nordstrom opened its first location in the Southeast at Perimeter Mall in Atlanta, Georgia.[28]\n\nOperations during 21st century\n\n[edit]\n\n2000–2009\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2000, the Nordstrom family reasserted its control, with the sons of Bruce A. (Blake, Erik and Peter) assuming senior roles in the company which they continue to hold.[29] Blake Nordstrom served as sole President of the company from 2000 to 2014 with Erik and Peter joining him as co-Presidents in 2015.[30]\n\nNordstrom sold its stand-alone boutique chain Façonnable in 2007, though it still offers that label in its lineup.\n\n2010–2019\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2011, Nordstrom announced the acquisition of HauteLook, an LA-based online retailer that offers flash sales on designer goods. The deal included Nordstrom paying $180 million in stock and a three-year \"earn-out\" payment based on HauteLook's financial performance.[31] On May 26, 2011, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing the downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, Circle Center Mall location due to declining business at the site. The remaining location on the north side of the city at the Fashion Mall at Keystone as well as the future Nordstrom Rack store in the Rivers Edge Shopping Center, also on the north side, remained as the only two locations in the state. Erik Nordstrom, president of stores at Nordstrom stated, \"We've enjoyed serving our customers in downtown Indianapolis, but unfortunately our business has declined over the long term for some time and despite our efforts to turn things around we don't see the outlook significantly changing.\"[32]\n\nIn August 2011, Nordstrom opened the store Treasure & Bond in SoHo, New York. Intended to test the waters of the tumultuous high-end department store scene in New York, all profits of Treasure & Bond are donated to charity. The customer base of the smaller store is thought to be the younger sisters of the typical Nordstrom customer.[33]\n\nNordstrom announced plans to open a Nordstrom Rack in Milwaukee in 2014.[34] In late November 2012, Nordstrom announced that they would also be opening a full-line Nordstrom Department Store in 2015 in Milwaukee at Mayfair Mall, a half-mile away from the Nordstrom Rack location. Milwaukee was the largest metropolitan area in the country that did not have a Nordstrom until 2015. Such unmet demand was highlighted in Nordstrom's decision to open in the Milwaukee area.[35]\n\nOn January 4, 2013, Nordstrom announced plans for a new location in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan region. The store, to be located at the Ridgedale Center, would be the second in the area. Following the success of its Mall of America opening in 1992, Nordstrom sought to expand in the Twin Cities market.[36] Plans for a Ridgedale Center store were first released in 2007, only to be canceled in 2009.[37] The location eventually opened in September 2015.\n\nNordstrom opened a 138,000-square-foot, two-level, full-line store March 2015 in The Mall of San Juan in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[38] After Hurricane Maria in 2017, the store suffered major water damage and it closed temporarily after the hurricane. Nordstrom reopened the store on November 9, 2018.[39] On May 7, 2020, Nordstrom announced that it would not reopen due to COVID-19 pandemic, leaving this store closed permanently.\n\nIn May 2015, Pete and Erik Nordstrom joined their brother Blake Nordstrom as co-presidents of Nordstrom. This arrangement lasted until Blake Nordstrom's death in January 2019.[40] Before this appointment, Pete Nordstrom was executive vice president and president of merchandising while Erik Nordstrom was executive vice president and president of Nordstrom.com.[40]\n\nNordstrom opened its first Rack location in Philadelphia in the fall of 2014.[41] In the fall of 2015, Nordstrom opened their first Nordstrom Rack store in Delaware.[42] The company is opening its first full-line store in New York City on April 12, 2018, a three-floor store at 57th Street and Broadway, in the Columbus Circle neighborhood.[43]\n\nIn 2016, Nordstrom entered into a partnership with Tesla Motors under which the automaker opened retail galleries inside the Nordstrom locations in The Grove, Los Angeles, in SouthPark Mall in Charlotte, North Carolina and in Somerset Collection in Troy, Michigan.[44][45]\n\nIn 2016, Nordstrom began selling products from J. Crew, Olivia Palermo + Chelsea28, Adore Me, and Eloquii.[46][47][48][49] In 2017, Nordstrom announced they would be expanding their natural beauty-focused stations.[50]\n\nOn February 2, 2017, Bloomberg News reported that Nordstrom would cease to carry Ivanka Trump's branded fashion line, citing weak sales. The retailer cuts 10 percent of its most poorly performing brands each year. Nordstrom's action came after a boycott campaign against retailers carrying products having Trump family labels.[51][52] President Donald Trump responded with a tweet directed at Nordstrom, condemning the brand for its treatment of his daughter. The company's stock dropped by 0.65% in the aftermath of the tweet before ending the day with a gain of more than 4%. Fortune declared this quick recovery to have broken Trump's market-moving \"tweet curse\".[53][54][55][56]\n\nIn October 2017, Nordstrom launched its first \"Nordstrom Local\" in West Hollywood, which is set to focus on personal shopping and styling, rather than carrying merchandise. In June 2017, Nordstrom Inc.'s founding family, which owned 31.2 percent of the company, said it was looking to take Nordstrom private.[57] In October, the family suspended its efforts, because of trouble completing a financing package.[58] Lenders were asking for 13 percent interest, about twice the typical rate for retailers.[59]\n\nOn January 2, 2019 Blake Nordstrom, co-president of Nordstrom, died suddenly at the age of 58. He was a lifetime employee of his family's company, rising through the ranks until he became a vice-president and then co-president.[60]\n\nIn fiscal year 2019, digital sales reached 33% of total sales, marking a growing transition to online retail.[61]\n\n2020–present\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 3, 2020, Erik Nordstrom became the sole CEO of Nordstrom.[62]\n\nOn March 16, the company announced that effective the following day, all locations would temporarily close during the COVID-19 pandemic.[63] On May 5, Nordstrom began reopening stores and announced that sixteen locations would permanently close by August.[64][65]\n\nIn late September, Nordstrom announced that by the end of 2021, their stores and websites would no longer sell products made from fur or exotic skins.[66]\n\nIn October 2021, Nordstrom announced an agreement with 11 Honoré, an online retailer of plus-sized designer fashion, to sell the company's clothing in Nordstrom stores and on their website.[67]\n\nNordstrom Canada\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom Canada Retail, Inc. (French: Les Detaillants Nordstrom Canada, Inc.) was the Canadian division of Nordstrom. It was announced on September 13, 2012, opened its first store on September 19, 2014, and closed its final stores on June 13, 2023. In this market, it competed with Canadian department stores including Holt Renfrew, Hudson's Bay, and Simons.[69]\n\nFour full-line Nordstrom stores were announced for the first phase of expansion, with nine full-line stores total expected in the long term.[70] Most of these stores were located in vacated Sears Canada storefronts in Cadillac Fairview-managed shopping centers, including Chinook Centre in Calgary; Rideau Centre in Ottawa; Toronto Eaton Centre in Toronto; and Pacific Centre in Vancouver. The stores at the CF-managed Sherway Gardens and the Oxford-managed Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto were new construction.[71] Of the first four stores announced, the Calgary store was the first to open on September 19, 2014.[72] It was followed by the Ottawa store on March 6, 2015;[73] the Vancouver store on September 18, 2015;[74] and the Sherway Gardens store on September 15, 2017.[75] The Yorkdale store was confirmed on April 8, 2013,[76] and opened on October 21, 2016.[77] The Toronto Eaton Centre was the last of the six stores to be announced on January 15, 2014,[78] however, it was the fourth to open on September 18, 2016.[79]\n\nThe first Nordstrom Rack opened at Vaughan Mills on March 21, 2018; and then a second location in Deerfoot Meadows in Calgary and a flagship location at One Bloor in Toronto opened on May 3, 2018.[80] Nordstrom Rack opened three other additional stores in Fall 2018; one at Heartland Town Centre in Mississauga, one at Ottawa Trainyards, and finally one at South Edmonton Commons.\n\nOn March 2, 2023, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing all their Canadian stores, which would entail 2,500 staff losing their jobs. The company stated, \"Despite our best efforts, we do not see a realistic path to profitability for the Canadian business.\"[81] The closing will be done under court supervision within the framework of the Canadian Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA), with the help of a third-party liquidator.[82] Liquidation sales began for all locations on March 21, 2023. All Canadian Nordstrom Rack locations closed on May 14, 2023,[83] while all Canadian full-line stores closed on June 13, 2023.\n\nRetail formats\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of May 2022 , there are 100 full-line Nordstrom department stores,[84] which average 140,000 square feet (13,000 m2).[85]\n\nNordstrom holds six annual sales. Two of these are Half-Yearly sales, which take place semi-annually in May and late December, as well as three additional seasonal sales. Nordstrom's largest sale event is the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, which is held each July.[86] Limited amounts of merchandise set to be released for the following fall are sent to Nordstrom stores early, where they are sold at discount. For ten days prior to Anniversary Sale, Nordstrom gives early access to members who make appointments.[87]\n\nNordstrom Local\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom Local service hubs are oriented for amenities including online order pickup, personal styling, and tailoring. They do not have their own inventory, and instead source merchandise from full-line stores as needed. As of May 2022 , there are seven Nordstrom Local locations between New York City and Los Angeles,[84] which average 3,000 square feet (280 m2).[85]\n\nRestaurants\n\n[edit]\n\nFast casual and full-service restaurants operate within most Nordstrom full-line stores.[88]\n\nList of Nordstrom restaurants[89] Restaurant Concept type Year\n\ndebuted Notes Bar Verde 2013 Bistro Verde Bazille Broadway Bar Bar Located within New York City flagship store Burger Bar American 2022 Located within New York City flagship store Cafe Bistro Cafe Nordstrom Classic Cafe 1980 Rebranded as Marketplace Cafe in 1998 Ebar Coffeehouse Gelato Bar 2016 Located in Ala Moana Center store Habitant Bar 2013 Hani Pacific Hawaiian 2019 Previously located within New York City flagship store Jeannie's Pizza 2019 Marketplace Cafe Comfort food 1998 Rebranded from Classic Cafe Milk Bar Bakery 2019 Located in New York City men's store Nordstrom Grill American NYC Clubhouse Bar Located in New York City men's store Oh Mochi Mochi donuts Ruscello Mediterranean Shoe Bar Bar Sweet Sundae Bar Dessert Wolf Italian 2019 Located within New York City flagship store\n\nNordstrom Rack\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Nordstrom Rack\n\nNordstrom Rack originated as a bargain basement in the downtown Seattle flagship store in 1973.

      "# [Retail mogul Bruce Nordstrom dies, aged 90 by Ana Faguy on 2024-05-20](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-69038112)\nBruce Nordstrom, the executive who helped grow the US department store Nordstrom into one of the country's largest retailers, died on Saturday at his home.\n\nHe was 90 years old.\n\nMr Nordstrom was among the third generation of leaders in his family business, who assumed control in 1968.\n\nHis sons, who now run the company, described their father as a \"legendary business leader\", in a statement confirming his death.\n\nNordstrom, co-founded by Mr Nordstrom's grandfather in 1901, started as a Seattle-based shoe shop.

      "# [Nordstrom family may try again to take the company private by Daphne Howland on 2024-04-19](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstrom-family-may-try-again-to-take-the-company-private/713679/)\nDive Brief:\n\nNordstrom’s board of directors has formed a special committee of “independent and disinterested directors” to “carefully evaluate any proposal from Erik and Pete Nordstrom and any proposals from other parties and consider whether they are in the best interests of Nordstrom and all shareholders,” per a company press release.\n\nThe Nordstrom brothers had notified the board in February of their interest in “potential equity financing for a ‘going private transaction,’” according to a Thursday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nErik Nordstrom, who is CEO, owns 7.45% of the company’s outstanding shares; Pete Nordstrom, who is president and chief brand officer, owns 7.41%; and other family members also own shares.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nDespite its reputation for stellar customer service, innovation and appealing assortments, Nordstrom hasn’t escaped the troubles that many department stores find themselves in — losing sales and ceding market share.\n\nThe retailer in recent years has shrunk its full-line fleet, exiting Canada entirely and opting to shutter 16 stores permanently during the height of the pandemic. In the meantime, it has greatly expanded its off-price Rack business, which many analysts see as volatile and lagging behind stalwarts like TJX and Ross.\n\n“It is no secret that over the past few years Nordstrom has struggled,” GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments. “Against this backdrop, the company value has shrunk, and Nordstrom has come under more pressure from investors. This will have caused pain to the founding family, many of whom still run the company, and seems to have rekindled their desire to take the chain private where they can operate away from the daily scrutiny of markets.”\n\nThe family attempted that six years ago, but its offer of $50 per share was rejected by the board as inadequate. At press time, shares are trading for less than $19. Still, it could be difficult to raise the necessary capital given today’s tight market, according to Saunders.\n\nMacy’s recent troubles may also be on the Nordstroms’ minds. That department store has been forced to reckon with investors agitating to unlock value from its real estate, who have offered $6.6 billion to take that department store over. Activist investors swooping onto Nordstrom in a similar fashion “would be an anathema to [the Nordstroms’] general ethos of doing business and by taking the company private they can safeguard its legacy,” Saunders said.\n\nErik and Pete’s great-grandfather, John W. Nordstrom, launched the business as a shoe store in Seattle in 1901. The company went public in 1971, with “JWN” as its stock ticker. Bringing the company back to firmer family control and out of the public markets could give Nordstrom the breathing room it needs to turn the business around, though taking on too much debt could hamper that, too, Saunders warned.\n\nReports that the Nordstrom family might want to take the company private surfaced last month, though the company at the time said it wouldn’t comment on rumors or market speculation.\n\nThe Nordstroms revealed their intentions while the board was evaluating various possible strategic alternatives that could enhance shareholder value, according to the company’s press release Thursday. The board’s new special committee has hired Morgan Stanley & Co. and Centerview Partners as financial advisors, and Sidley Austin and Perkins Coie as legal counsel.",
      "# [Nordstrom to open more Indochino shop-in-shops by Tatiana Walk-Morris on 2024-07-26](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstrom-indochino-expand-shop-in-shops/722494/)\nDive Brief:\n\nAlong with new showroom openings, Indochino is expanding its partnership with Nordstrom with more shop-in-shops. The DTC apparel brand on Thursday said it will now offer its made-to-measure suiting experience within the department store’s location in Cerritos, California; Thousand Oaks, California; Irvine, California; Pentagon City, Virginia; and Lynnwood, Washington.\n\nSince launching their collaboration in 2020, the latest expansion brings the total Indochino shop-in-shops in Nordstrom to 32, placing the custom clothing brand within 50 miles of more than 90% of U.S. shoppers, according to a company press release.\n\nThe shop-in-shops will have Indochino Style Guides to assist customers in creating custom-tailored suits, shirts, chinos and outerwear, per the press release.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nIndochino’s shop-in-shop openings add to the DTC apparel brand’s brick-and-mortar expansion efforts. This month, the company said it planned to open five additional U.S. showrooms by the end of September in South Carolina, Texas, New York, Utah and California.\n\nThe new shop-in-shops at Nordstrom will not only allow the brand to reach more customers, but the expansion also indicates “growing demand for personalized fashion,” Indochino CEO Drew Green said in a statement.\n\nFor Nordstrom, the expanded partnership with Indochino builds on its commitment to adding popular DTC brands to its assortment in order to stay relevant with consumers. Over the years, the department store has added brands like Bonobos, Everlane and Reformation to attract more shoppers. In a similar move, Neiman Marcus partnered with ThirdLove, which allowed the intimate’s brand to sell its products at Neiman’s Dallas, Atlanta and Coral Gables, Florida, stores.\n\nAs Indochino grows its physical reach, the brand has continued to build out its product assortment to appeal to more customers. Last year, the company expanded its womenswear offering to all of its locations and online, a move it made after initially announcing its intentions to enter the category in late 2021. Earlier this year, the brand debuted its first ready-to-wear suit collection in showrooms across the U.S. and Canada.",

Please let us know if you have feedback.\n\nDive Brief:\n\nNordstrom credited CX improvements, including improved e-commerce search and more efficient supply chain operations, as major contributors to its 3.4% net sales growth, executives said on a Q2 2024 earnings callTuesday.\n\nMore efficient operations enable faster returns and ensure popular items are available when customers need them, according to executives. The effort includes using RFID tags on items at more stores to improve accuracy and speed of service.\n\n“Our efforts to improve the customer experience are taking hold, as evidenced by the strength of our top line,” Cathy Smith, CFO of Nordstrom, said during the earnings call. “In the second quarter, we grew our customer count, recorded an increase in customer trips and expanded margins.”\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSpeedier backend operations aid Nordstrom’s efforts to deliver solid CX, whether customers shop in-store or online.\n\nA faster supply chain helps ensure customers can always find what they want while reducing costs for the retailer, according to Erik Nordstrom, CEO of Nordstrom. The right inventory serves as a foundation for good experiences.\n\nRFID tags, electronic devices to track individual items, are an important part of this strategy. The technology helps track how quickly popular items are being sold, leading to better in-stock rates. RFID can also help associates quickly locate whatever product a customer wants, speeding up in-store experiences.\n\nThe RFID rollout improves warehouse operations as well, leading to faster e-commerce order delivery times in previous quarters.\n\nNordstrom began to overhaul its data and analytics capabilities in the second quarter, according to Smith. The retailer expects the effort to enhance its ability to use generative AI once the transformation is complete at the end of the year.\n\nNot all of Nordstrom’s CX efforts are focused on the backend. The company’s annual anniversary sale in July and August included 900 in-store events, up about 20% from the previous year, according to Peter Nordstrom, president and chief brand officer at Nordstrom.",

      "# [EXCLUSIVE: Nordstrom.com Is Aiming to Be the ‘Spotify of Fashion’ With New Marketplace by David Moin on 2024-04-29](https://wwd.com/business-news/retail/nordstrom-launches-online-marketplace-offerings-of-brands-sizes-and-prices-to-grow-1236337054/)\nNordstrom Inc. has launched a digital marketplace platform aiming to grow the offering on its website and app, increase revenues and provide sellers with a wider audience.\n\nDigital growth is a top priority at Nordstrom. Last year, digital accounted for 36 percent, or about $5 billion, of ’s total sales of $14.22 billion.\n\nFor now at least, Nordstrom is easing into its new marketplace format by not rushing to bring in a great many new brands right away. However, executives said they do expect to grow their online product assortment by two to three times in the next few years while keeping their online channels curated, customer-centric and service-oriented. The marketplace went live Monday.\n\nAmong the key brands available on the marketplace and new to Nordstrom are Dippin’ Daisy’s, a fast-growing swimwear brand; Maison de Sabre luxury leather goods, and Tracksmith, the running brand.\n\nAmong other brands joining Nordstrom via the marketplace are Adore Me, Alala, Ana Luisa, Cynthia Rowley, Derek Lam 10 Crosby, Deux Par Deux, Dia & Co., DXL, La DoubleJ, Natori and Onia.\n\n“The sellers and brands on our marketplace will have the exact same threshold of quality and relevance to our customers as any other brand we do business with. There’s a very high bar for the products we choose to present to our customer base. Nothing changes. We are not going to become ‘the everything store,'” Miguel Almeida, president of Nordstrom digital and customer experience, told WWD in an interview.\n\nAmplifying Categories\n\n“It’s about extending our ability to find incredible brands we believe our customers will love and introducing them to those brands at a bigger scale, without the cost of a wholesale model,” Almeida added. “The marketplace also allows us to offer the full expression of the top brands we already have.”\n\nAsked what categories not currently sold by Nordstrom could be or are being introduced to the online marketplace, Almeida replied: “It’s not necessarily a category extension strategy. It’s more about amplifying the categories that we have and serving customers better in those categories.” Still, he did single out marketplace opportunities to “lean” into the gifting, home and outdoor categories; accelerate growth with brands targeting younger customers, and offer extended sizes and a wider range of prices.\n\n“Our marketplace will feel very, very connected with what Nordstrom is known for. It just allows us more flexibility and agility,” Almeida said. “We can also be much more intentional about serving customers better in different locations.”\n\nNordstrom isn’t aggressively seeking out brands to introduce to its new digital marketplace. As Almeida said, “We want to make sure that everything goes right before we scale and expand too fast. It’s fully live, but the marketplace is not going to have all of that significant growth in Day One, to ensure that everything is fully buttoned up as we present this new offering to customers.”\n\nNordstrom has partnered with Mirakl and its platform which allows brands to set up their assortments on retailers’ websites. “We see Mirakl as the industry leading solution and they have given us the ability to eventually co-innovate with them in this space,” Almeida said.\n\nHe emphasized that with its marketplace, the Seattle-based Nordstrom will maintain its reputation for service. “We’ll handle customer care directly with the customer, which most marketplace models from other retailers don’t do,” Almeida said. “When there is customer care issue, they put the customer in contact with the seller directly, bypassing their own customer care team. But we are handling our own care with customers, and then we deal with the brands separately. The customer will continue interfacing with us and the people here they’ve known. We are honoring our legacy of service and trust, saying, ‘if you have any questions, let us know.'”\n\nA customer seeking to return an item bought on the marketplace can return it to a Nordstrom store, and get the refund quicker rather than shipping it back to the seller and waiting days for the refund. “We will refund the customer directly and take the product just like it was any other product that we’re serving through wholesale,” said Almeida.\n\nMarketplace to Brick-and-mortar\n\n“There’s also a very deliberate connection between marketplace and our stores,” he added. “Our stylists have access to style boards and will be able to complement their styling consultations with broader assortments than what they have in the stores. We can also set up alterations for products bought on the marketplace. There’s a service integration.”\n\nWith the marketplace, Nordstrom can jump on emerging trends faster. “It’s a much easier process for brands to start selling with us,” compared to the traditional wholesale model, Almeida said, adding that with the marketplace model, it can take less than 30 days from identifying a trend to placing the relevant items on the site.\n\nSome marketplace items could wind up being sold in Nordstrom stores as well. “The idea is to be agile in showing customers relevant products and brands that we believe they will love,” Almeida said. “As soon as we see that traction, our merchandising teams are informed in terms of what they would want to buy and put in stores. Absolutely, this is a way for some brands to show up in our stores.”\n\nWith the marketplace model, brands manage the merchandise content, pricing and shipping, while Nordstrom can affect the look of how products are presented. Nordstrom receives a commission when a listed item is sold on the marketplace. Commissions are generally standard, with minimal variation if at all, from brand to brand, Almeida said.\n\nWith the wholesale model, “We don’t have unlimited dollars. Our merchants have to make very hard choices around the breadth and depth of brands we sell to make the economics of our business work. Marketplace allows us to break free from those economics,” explained Almeida, who along with his team is responsible for Nordstrom.com, Nordstromrack.com and the customer experience strategy across both online and in stores. Prior to Nordstrom, he led Starbucks’s digital team and the design, product management and technology of the Starbucks mobile app. Earlier, he was the executive vice president of digital at Lululemon Athletica, and held leadership roles at Walgreens Boots Alliance, Apple, Dell and the Boston Consulting Group.\n\nWith the marketplace format, retailers do not own the merchandise or manage the shipping to customers, which is different from wholesaling where retailers own the merchandise bought by their merchants, hold it in their warehouses and stores, and deliver it to customers. It’s also different from drop shipping where a retailer would own the goods being sold online but they’re shipped by the supplier.\n\nRisks and Reputation\n\nRetailers make less money on each item purchased on a marketplace, since products are listed, not owned, and sold on commission. There is less financial risk and potentially, retailers could make up what they lose in margin by generating greater volume with the larger marketplace assortment. There are other kinds of risks, however. Brands sometimes find themselves near other brands of inferior quality, affecting perceptions. Brands also risk cannibalizing their sales on one marketplace from another. In addition, if a consumer orders from a marketplace and is disappointed by a poor shipping experience (it arrives late or the wrong product is delivered) the marketplace might be blamed and its reputation suffer, even though it could be the fault of the brand handling the shipping.\n\nGiant digital marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Alibaba, Farfetch and Shopify list a vast array of categories and items. Some are characterized as “generalists,” meaning they offer everything to everybody without having a sharp identity or clear image — something Nordstrom promises to avoid. In the last few years, a fast-growing subset of smaller retail marketplaces has emerged including Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s, Hudson’s Bay, Best Buy, Stadium Goods, Lands’ End, Crate & Barrel, and Urban Outfitters.\n\n“Our vision is to become the Spotify of fashion, and that means receiving signals from customers on what they want from us and showing them our expanding extended assortment in a way that is unique to them,” Almeida said. “We’re putting significant effort on evolving the experience of our and our mobile app. We’re going to infuse (both) with more inspirational content. We’re going to make that discovery experience a lot more exciting with a much broader assortment that comes to life through the marketplace.”\n\nAsked if a marketplace could also be developed for the Nordstrom Rack off-price division, Almeida said, “We’re not launching with Rack but it could in the future apply to Rack.”",
