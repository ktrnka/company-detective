  "summary_markdown": "# About Nordstrom\n\nNordstrom, Inc. is a prominent American luxury department store chain headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The company was founded in 1901 as a shoe store and has since evolved into a full-line retailer. As of 2023, Nordstrom operates over 360 stores across the United States, including Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, and Nordstrom Local locations [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom). The company is renowned for its commitment to customer service and has a long-standing reputation in the retail industry.\n\nNordstrom's product offerings are diverse, encompassing apparel, shoes, accessories, and beauty products, such as the MAC Cremesheen Lipstick, which is known for its creamy texture and rich color payoff [(shop.nordstrom.com)](https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/mac-cremesheen-lipstick/5515065/lite). The company primarily operates in the B2C market, catering to a wide range of customers, from casual shoppers to professional makeup artists.\n\nIn terms of financial performance, Nordstrom reported net earnings of $122 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, with total net sales increasing by 3.4% compared to the same period in fiscal 2023 [(PR Newswire, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nordstrom-reports-second-quarter-2024-earnings-302232005.html). Digital sales accounted for 37% of total sales during this quarter, highlighting the company's focus on enhancing its e-commerce capabilities [(Digital Commerce 360, 2024)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/12/27/nordstrom-family-strikes-deal-to-take-company-private/).\n\nNordstrom's distribution channels include full-line stores, Nordstrom Rack, and Nordstrom Local, with the latter focusing on online order pickups and personal styling services [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom). The company is also known for its annual Anniversary Sale, which offers significant discounts on a wide range of products [(Hollywood Reporter, 2024)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/shopping/nordstrom-anniversary-sale-date-early-access-deals-1234975177/).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nErik Nordstrom serves as the CEO of Nordstrom, Inc., while Pete Nordstrom is the President and Chief Brand Officer. Both are part of the fourth generation of the Nordstrom family involved in the business. The Nordstrom family will hold a 50.1% stake in the company following its acquisition, with El Puerto de Liverpool owning 49.9% [(PR Newswire, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nordstrom-to-be-acquired-by-nordstrom-family-and-liverpool-302338345.html).\n\nThe recent passing of Bruce Nordstrom, a key figure in the company's expansion, has been noted as a significant loss for the family and the business. His leadership helped shape Nordstrom into a national brand, and his legacy continues through the current leadership [(BBC, 2024)](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-69038112).\n\n# News\n\n## Acquisition Announcement\n\nOn December 23, 2024, Nordstrom announced a definitive agreement to be acquired by the Nordstrom family and El Puerto de Liverpool, a Mexican retail group, in a deal valued at approximately $6.25 billion. Shareholders will receive $24.25 per share, representing a 42% premium over the stock price as of March 18, 2024 [(PR Newswire, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nordstrom-to-be-acquired-by-nordstrom-family-and-liverpool-302338345.html). This acquisition will take Nordstrom private, allowing the company to operate with more flexibility and focus on long-term growth strategies without the pressures of quarterly financial reporting [(Digital Commerce 360, 2024)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/12/27/nordstrom-family-strikes-deal-to-take-company-private/).\n\n## Financial Performance\n\nIn its second quarter earnings report for fiscal 2024, Nordstrom reported net earnings of $122 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, with total net sales increasing by 3.4% compared to the same period in fiscal 2023 [(PR Newswire, 2024)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nordstrom-reports-second-quarter-2024-earnings-302232005.html). Digital sales accounted for 37% of total sales during this quarter, reflecting the company's ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce capabilities [(Digital Commerce 360, 2024)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/12/27/nordstrom-family-strikes-deal-to-take-company-private/).\n\n## Store Closures and Strategic Shifts\n\nAs part of its restructuring efforts, Nordstrom announced the closure of all Canadian stores in March 2023, citing an inability to achieve profitability in that market. This decision resulted in approximately 2,500 job losses [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom). Additionally, the company plans to close two locations in Massachusetts in early 2025 as part of its strategy to optimize its store footprint [(NBC Boston, 2025)](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/nordstrom-massachusetts-closures/3595282/).\n\n## Market Position and Challenges\n\nNordstrom faces significant challenges in the retail landscape, including competition from discount retailers and the ongoing shift towards e-commerce. The company has been working to enhance its digital presence and has seen growth in online sales, which accounted for 36% of total sales in the fiscal year ending February 2024 [(Digital Commerce 360, 2024)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/12/27/nordstrom-family-strikes-deal-to-take-company-private/).\n\nDespite these challenges, the acquisition by the Nordstrom family and Liverpool is seen as a strategic move to revitalize the brand and focus on long-term growth without the scrutiny of public markets [(ABC 7 NY, 2024)](https://abc7ny.com/post/nordstrom-family-mexican-retail-group-acquire-department-store-625-billion-deal/15697367/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNordstrom, Inc. is at a pivotal moment in its history, transitioning to private ownership while navigating a challenging retail environment. The company's commitment to customer service and its diverse product offerings position it well for future growth, particularly as it enhances its e-commerce capabilities. The leadership of the Nordstrom family remains integral to the company's identity and future direction. For prospective candidates and investors, the upcoming changes present both opportunities and risks, making it essential to monitor the company's performance and strategic initiatives closely.",

Also as the other person said the lines are pretty long (mine only took me about 15 minutes to get through but it was still the longest I've ever seen there, but I went at like 3pm so maybe that helped?).\n\nSo I'd say if you have some time to kill and want to buy some items from a brand where you already know how it fits you then I'd say go for it, but otherwise I'd say skip it.\n\n### Comment ID fva2lti with +1 score by [(schrutefarms-, Reddit, 2020-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/hbnjud/is_it_worth_checking_out_the_in_store_nordstrom/fva2lti/) (in reply to ID fv9xeu6):\nOh I didn’t know it was final sale :/ \nI’m going to check it out.

I waited in line for an hour and a half to check out (I timed it), no line to get in. I sincerely felt *insanely* guilty about going inside, as this was the first day they’re open again in my state and I didn’t realize til I talked to an employee. But the sale is absolutely insane. I got Birkenstocks for $18, some $20 Nikes, and a bunch of amazing exercise gear for $10 apiece. 40% off *everything* is really a ridiculous steal. It is an *incredible* sale, it’s just necessary to be super patient and maybe scope out the store to see how the employees seem to be faring / how crowded it is before going in?\n\n### Comment ID fvb7ha4 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/hbnjud/is_it_worth_checking_out_the_in_store_nordstrom/fvb7ha4/) (in reply to ID fv9x49j):\n>  how crowded it is before going in?\n\nWere they not limiting the number of people where you are?

Everything is on clearance plus an optional 40% off. If you opt out of the 40% off things are refundable, if you chose to go for the extra 40% off, it’s final sale. The one downside is that fitting rooms are closed so you kind of have to know your size if you want to get the 40% off due to final sale. The first day I waited in line for about two hours. It sucked. I did end up going back the next day with my brother so he could buy some clothes, probably waited about an hour this time. I did see people that came in pairs would have one person wait in line while the other one looked around. I personally thought it was a really good sale. To give you an idea of the sales my mom got a lot of quality clothes, pots etc (21 items total) for $160!! My brother got really nice sunglasses that were valued at $100, dress shoes, several pairs of button down shirts, several sweatpants/athletic clothes from champion/nike, and Nike slides for about $180. I got Quay sunglasses for $14.\n\n## Comment ID fvau1gw with +2 score by [(Cheapthrills96, Reddit, 2020-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/hbnjud/is_it_worth_checking_out_the_in_store_nordstrom/fvau1gw/) (in reply to ID hbnjud):\nI went.

I may have gone to 3 different stores lol. It was amazing!! No like to get in, I did wait in line to checkout for almost an hour twice, but the third time it was maybe like 20 min. It was so worth the insane deals. Like I got 2 Reformation dresses - $22 & $30, $12 Born booties that I have in another color, paid $130 for, Boss silk blouse $25, Vince silk blouse $30, Ted Baker WOC $30, CK suit $36, I can’t even remember what else. I got several things that I had also ordered recently - going to return those and keep the super cheap ones I got now!

I was wondering if the clothes and Nordstrom Rack were the same quality as Nordstrom or does the designers make a cheaper brand for the Rack.

They have that nice thick 80s cotton.  Look for made in then USA.  Even up to 90s Ralph Lauren, Levi’s, Calvin Klein, Levi’s, Gloria Vanderbilt will be sturdy. \n\nBecause new dark washes are going to fade in the knees and look bad.

I’m pretty sure brands like Madewell and Topshop and Reformation don’t make clothes for NR specifically, so there’s a good chance those are the real quality. However, it’s kind of difficult to find garments from those brands that aren’t....kind of ugly. The reason they’re usually found at NR is because they were unpopular and didn’t sell.

They don’t ever seem to have a big enough range in the store to suggest so, it’s almost always a very small selection of what seem like leftovers. It also wouldn’t really be their brand to do that. It’s usually because they didn’t sell, but the good stuff I’ve found has been out of season. Like, I found a nice topshop sweater during summer. It’s really just a crapshoot. If it were me, I’d say it’s worth giving a try and just returning if need be.\n\n## Comment ID f5nyuwh with +4 score by [(b2g1, Reddit, 2019-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5nyuwh/) (in reply to ID do8kat):\nBuy 100% cotton jeans.

Found a dream pair of Cole Haan shoes at the Rack.\n\nBack then there were only a few stores and they got the merchandise that didn't sell off in the department stores when the seasons changed or actual designer samples and seconds.\n\nNow not only are manufacturers being very, very careful about overage so they have fewer leftover pieces but more designers are handling their own sample sales AND places like Nordstrom's Rack turned into a pretty big chain.\n\nThey don't have enough \"real\" pieces so they get things made for them.  Since they're still trying to keep the price point low those pieces aren't going to be the same quality as department store or real designer clothes.\n\nI have actually found bras and underwear there that are pretty good a couple of years ago but I have been in recently.

I work for a fashion brand that's sold in Nordstrom and I can guarantee that anything you find at Rack from us is the real deal.  Building out an entirely different and cheaper manufacturing process just to sell at Rack at a lower cost wouldn't be economically practical for us.  \n\nUsually when I find things at Rack from our brand, it's from the past season, whereas what is found in Nordstrom's is the current season.  For example, we're a denim focused brand, so you'll currently find lots of washes from the summer in Rack right now, whereas Nordstroms is only selling from our fall/winter collection. \n\nI can only speak for my brand, but I imagine it is a similar situation for others as well.\n\n### Comment ID f5xhivq with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5xhivq/) (in reply to ID f5xdpgm):\nThanks you for this information.

There is no Burberry made for Nordstrom Rack that will share the same label. Some designers make a cheaper price point sublabel that goes by an alternate name but that has less to do with outlets specifically. I guess the grey area is really  brands that Nordstrom themselves owns because they can do whatever they want with them.\n\n## Comment ID f6puctl with +1 score by [(Crickket66, Reddit, 2019-11-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f6puctl/) (in reply to ID do8kat):\nNordstrom Full-line and Rack stores actually often get the exact same merchandise in and you’ll sometimes find its actually going to be cheaper at The Rack than it is at a full line store. The quality is usually the same especially in denim. The only thing to be cautious of is the clearance items as they often do have defects like a weird cut or length. I really recommend trying everything on before purchasing. I also don’t recommend Madewell denim as it seems to not be of good quality from my own personal experience.

Lots of bloggers and Insta - Influencers make a big deal about their Nordi semi-annual sale hauls. You can get some amazing deals if you find items you want at Nordstrom, add them to your wishlist on the app or website, or just keep them in your cart and then when the semi-annual sale comes the discounts will be automatically applied. Of course, it really pays to be a rewards member and/or a card holder because you get access to the semi-annual sale earlier than others. The rewards membership is free and all you have to do is enter your phone number anytime you shop to get \"notes\" and they're pretty easy to get and redeem. \n\nPlus, personal preference, but Nordstrom stores are just the nicest. The layout is consistent and its design team just does such a nice job of making sure the space is open, airy, classy, bright and comfortable. I also think Nordstrom has the best options for makeup and fragrance. It is the only one that carries Jo Malone outside of Sephora in the U.S. which is my favorite fragrance brand. \n\nNordstrom just makes the in-person shopping experience feel really nice. They offer a free personal shopping experience which I have never done but would love to do where you go in and you tell them your size and style and they will pull pieces and curate some looks for you and the only thing you pay is what you end up buying. Its those little services that make a difference in my book.\n\n### Comment ID gzghcrz with +6 score by [(loi_, Reddit, 2021-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/gzghcrz/) (in reply to ID gzfnmw0):\nThank you for this!

In my experience (though I’m definitely not a major fashion expert, I have lived and shopped in a few different cities) Bloomingdales is equivalent with Macy’s. Nordstrom is a lot better than both. Saks is definitely the most expensive and definitely does have some higher quality items, but you’re going to be paying for it.\n\nI like Nordstrom the best personally. Even if I was an independently wealthy millionaire, I’m pretty sure that I’d chose to shop with them. Their return policy rocks. If you have a card (maybe even if you don’t, I’m not sure) they give you credits for free alterations which can be really awesome if you find something that you love but doesn’t fit you just right. \n\nI’ve never bothered to do it, but you can call and give a general or specific list of things that you’re looking for (like vacation wear, casual stuff, something to wear to a friend or relatives wedding events, etc). A shopper will get a lot of stuff together and put it aside so that it’s ready for you to look over and try on when you show up. You don’t have to buy any of it either.\n\nWhen I’ve went in just to browse and tried something on, the salesperson always offered to bring me other things if what I had didn’t work. If I said no thanks and didn’t buy anything, they were still friendly and sweet. \n\nIdk, I’ve been to other places where I couldn’t walk for 5 minutes before someone new dying to sell me something would just pop out. I hated that, and haven’t experienced it at nordys. I sound like some kind of company ambassador 😂 🤣\n\n#### Comment ID gzgghig with +6 score by [(Gilmoregirlin, Reddit, 2021-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/gzgghig/) (in reply to ID gzg3dd5):\nI like Nordstrom because they hem things for free and I am short, so long as they are full price.  I live in the DC area and we used to have one Bloomies that was in White Flint (closed) which was like Macy’s but the one we have now which is in Friendship heights is very high end like Saks, people are super snotty in there!

Many Nordstrom stores in my area even have Gucci/Chanel/Prada boutiques literally built into the store.

I've only been inside one true saks once, so i can't comment on that shopping experience, but i definitely prefer shopping at nordstrom over Bloomingdale's. And the nordstrom shoe store is the best out of the 3.\n\nHonestly, I'm at the point where if i need something, i typically check just nordstrom first to see what's available at what price points before i branch out to other stores. It just has everything, the returns policy is excellent, the bathrooms are better maintained and better lit, they do some alterations for you, and their in-store restaurant is better than Bloomingdale's.\n\n## Comment ID h2vikv7 with +2 score by [(vegaslivin26, Reddit, 2021-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/h2vikv7/) (in reply to ID nkrqd6):\nThey’re basically the same. Bloomingdale’s is Macy’s. It’s the same company. You’re paying for their overpriced Macy’s crap. Nordstrom you get their house brands which include actually decent merchandise that have been around for decades as well as the customer service that goes along with it. Neiman’s probably is considered the more exclusive department store in terms of brands carried, but Nordstrom actually does have the exact same depending on your location. Saks is equivalent to Neiman’s but with shorter in person hours & terrible service. I personally look at how many places have discount chain versions of their stores. They all do minus Neiman’s. That should help you if you want to rank by exclusivity.\n\n### Comment ID k471nnq with +2 score by [(Primary_Mirror_3504, Reddit, 2023-10-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/k471nnq/) (in reply to ID h2vikv7):\nMacy's is in the middle as far as high-end to low-end.

      "# Post ID i7wd1s: I assumed being sold at Nordstrom meant a brand was a high-quality, luxury brand. Turns out Nordstrom.com is just a marketplace (like Amazon or Walmart.com) where anybody can sell. with +103 score by [(e925, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/)\n**Edit: Ok not ANYBODY who wants to sell there can sell there. But they aren’t as choosy and bougie as one might think. The takeaway is this: If you, like me, equate the name “Nordstrom” with high-quality, luxury brands (like Nordstrom used to carry exclusively), that is no longer the case.** \n\n**Because something has been sold at Nordstrom Rack (like Byroe), it does not mean it was once sold at Nordstrom and just went on clearance. Just because something is sold at Nordstrom (or Nordstrom Rack), it no longer should imply quality or luxury, like my poor-person brain thought it still did. Oh, and don’t pick the Byroe serum. The ingredients are terrible.**\n\nI recently saw a post about how Grace & Stella (an admitted private label company) is now selling their products at Nordstrom. \n\nThis made me remember the times that I’ve questioned a brand’s legitimacy, only to be reassured of their quality when I saw the products were available to purchase at Nordstrom (a luxury retailer).\n\nI once saw somebody comment that the Byroe toner was Boxycharm including a product with an artificially inflated price point, and I defended them by saying, “This is not the same as the $90 brush set situation. They sell Byroe at Nordstrom. $90 is the actual price.”\n\n~~I alsowondered why I had never heard of Malin + Goetz before seeing them in beauty boxes, but when I looked them up, I saw that they were for sale at Nordstrom.com. This led me to believe that Malin + Goetz is a prestige brand.~~\n\nBut when it was brought to my attention that Grace & Stella was being sold at Nordstrom.com, I was like whaaa...? \n\nI know for a fact that Grace & Stella is not a luxury brand. I’m not saying that all private labeling is bad - but when I think of a product being sold at Nordstrom, I assume it’s on par with Jo Malone, Khiel’s, Dior, etc., which I know Grace & Stella is *not*. \n\nSo I did some research, and it turns out [anybody can sell](https://www.acenda.com/content/sell-on-nordstrom) at Nordstrom.com. That’s why I couldn’t find Byroe ~~or Malin + Goetz~~ for sale anywhere else.\n\nJust a PSA, in case anybody else was still looking at Nordstrom as a luxury retailer, aka from a 1990s point of view.\n\nEdit: ok so I was wrong about Malin + Goetz (it shows up at other retailers if you search for that retailer specifically), but I’m doubling down on Byroe. Take today’s Boxycharm choice of [Tomato Serum](https://byroe.com/products/tomato-serum).  The first four ingredients are cheap moisturizers and fillers, and the 5th ingredient is alcohol. Tomato extract is the 47th out of 48 ingredients.

Former Nordstrom corporate employee here. This isn't exactly true. Nordstrom doesn't let just anyone sell products like Amazon or Walmart.  Nordstrom does have a drop ship program, but a vendor still has to pass through a process and a buyer has to want the merchandise. [This list that was referenced](https://www.nordstrom.com/browse/nordstrom-cares/partnership-guidelines) is customer facing, it is definitely not all of the requirements for becoming a drop ship partner. This is a broad overview for curious people. They are not going to state \"you must be a luxury brand\" explicitly on a customer facing page, they are more about creating the \"atmosphere\" of luxury or if they state that a brand is luxury it's usually with a euphemism or about how something feels. I know that their image is what is keeping them afloat in this brutal retail world so I don't think they would throw that away to become an online marketplace.\n\nThey are probably selling Grace and Stella because, as someone else mentioned, they are hype right now, and Nordstrom wanted to cash in on that. Grace and Stella's marketing team is much smarter than face skin's; they have a much better image. I agree that this was a miss for them, and I doubt they would have agreed to the partnership if they knew they were alibaba crap. Nordstrom sold Goop gemstones for like $80 that were \"blessed\" by someone named Heather. They want to jump on trends.\n\n### Comment ID g15i8sa with +3 score by [(pounce_the_panther, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g15i8sa/) (in reply to ID g14xn25):\nAll of the Grace and Stella items I can find are in the Pop Up shop.

Thanks for taking the time to give your input. \n\nI guess my point was this - I was excited for the Byroe toner because I saw it at Nordstrom Rack. \n\nI thought all products at Nordstrom Rack were products that were once sold at Nordstrom and had gone on clearance, so I used the fact that the Byroe toner was on clearance “for $29.97 from $95” [at Nordstrom Rack](https://www.nordstromrack.com/shop/product/3115305/byroe-bitter-green-essence-toner?color=GREEN) as clear evidence that Byroe is a legitimate luxury brand, and the Byroe toner was once sold at Nordstrom proper for $95. \n\nI’m probably not the only person here who thought the Nordstrom name was equivalent to a legitimate product. \n\nIt says 86% off, which gives the impression to me, an un-savvy shopper, that Nordstrom buyers think the Byroe toner is worth $95, because Nordstrom at one point “carried it.” \n\nDoes that make sense? I used the Nordstrom name as evidence of Byroe’s legitimacy when in conversation with others, but I now realize that that was not a valid argument. \n\nThe Byroe Tomato serum is a choice for a Boxy Premium today (and the ingredients are not worth $150), so I still think the post is important, just in case a fellow un-savvy shopper mistakenly assumed that Byroe = Nordstrom = Quality, when it does not mean that in the same way that it used to.\n\n#### Comment ID g15t78k with +15 score by [(Ditovontease, Reddit, 2020-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g15t78k/) (in reply to ID g15cll9):\nNever assume Rack is the same as Nordstrom.

Malin + Goetz is definitely a legit brand, they are sold at a lot of the major retailers for years. They also have been supplying products to a lot of luxury hotels etc. so it fits that top tier status, in my opinion. It might not be a brand targeted to a young demographic so I don't think they do a lot of social media marketing. You can find them on Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, Sephora, Saks Fifth, their own boutiques and other retailers too. \n2. IDK about Byroe, since I am not interested in their products and haven't come across them.\n3. Grace & Stella is a brand, a millenial/gen-z/IG hyped up brand, that is. I haven't done my research but I would assume Nordstrom sells them because of their following, their \"aesthetic\" and their clout. LOL. So people who are interested in the brand would drive traffic to Nordstrom and perhaps buy other products from Nordstrom too, which gives them more money. Grace & Stella is a brand disguising as a luxury brand... They have good marketers and brand relationship managers to be honest, being able to get this far. Props to them.\n4. To your point, yes you are correct Grace & Stella is not a luxury brand when you compare it to Chanel, Dior and other brands being sold at Nordstrom. However, I also don't think Nordstrom = Walmart, Amazon where it's a free for all marketplace. I'm sure the brands go through an approval process where both parties benefit from the exposure and sales they get from Nordstrom. That's why there is no Wet & Wild or LA Girl there. Grace & Stella sells their stuff on a higher price point than drugstore and are aligning themselves to the likes of Saturday Skin, Youth to the People, Herbivore and other cutesy packaging, millenial reaching skincare brands *hence maybe why* you also see them at Nordstrom.\n\n### Comment ID g14nvrt with +18 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14nvrt/) (in reply to ID g14lg38):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID g14qpad with +11 score by [(biancae1izabeth, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14qpad/) (in reply to ID g14nvrt):\nYeah I'm with you!

Anyone who has had their images stolen by Alibaba and wish sellers knows that the product you're getting is RARELY the same thing as is shown in the picture. The picture is almost always a higher quality item that the cheap wholesale seller is duping. If you want to find instances of this, just take a look at simplynailogical's 500 videos about stolen content on wish - it is a huge problem especially for smaller brands and unknown creators to have their content stolen by online retailers because they have very little excess cash and legal backing to get them taken down. \n\n2 the items that YOU buy off alibaba, even if it seems to be the exact same product as something else, are rarely the same product a private labeler is buying. Private label companies don't log into alibaba and buy a bulk inventory and then repackage the goods. They contact a factory to have items specifically made for their order, often already with their private label on them or entirely unlabeled so that the company can brand them themselves and repackage in higher quality packaging. You can see this with practically all the hair accessories you can buy at any major retailer across the US. It is the same stuff with a different name on it. Theres only so many ways to make a Bobby pin! Private labelers dont automatically have bad quality just because they private label, they're just rebranding existing products and sometimes that product is crap and sometimes it isnt. A huge, well known private labeling company you all know and love is Trader Joe's. The majority of their products are existing products made by other brands relabeled for trader Joe's, sometimes with slight variations just so the trader Joe's one has a different ingredient list. Sometimes they just change the names on the ingredients even so you cant find their dupes, like using the chemical name for banana extract instead of just saying \"banana extract\". There is a big difference between you buying skincare from wish and the brand buying their original unlabeled product, #1 being when they import things to the US under their new private label, their stock is all going to be identical, whereas if you buy two of the exact same items off wish you could end up with two totally different products. Thats because Even private labelers have quality control. I think there is a lot of confusion about this especially on this app because of the one major private label scandal we all know that came up and now everyone thinks all private labelers are trying to poison us, but one of the reasons that story got so big is because they weren't just private labeling, they were doing it very badly and not doing proper quality control, which was the only reason anyone even knew they were a private labeler. Had they done a great job, you probably never would have known. Other private labelers will do everything they can not to make the same mistakes, because they dont want a scandal to marr their brands. Dls probably spends more trying to dig out of the pit from their scandal than they do on any other marketing by creating new brands all the time. They Have to make new brands to survive. No other brand wants to be in the same shoes as dls.\n\n3 almost all products' retail value are roughly 10% material cost, 10% packaging, 20% marketing, and 60% profit margin. The marketing they do isnt always to consumers. They also have to market to retailers to get them to carry their products\n\n4 luxury brands produce products in china too. Everyone does. Huge workforce, low labor and infrastructure costs. It just makes sense if you want to drive your costs down as much as possible. If they're not producing out of china it is from Indonesia, Thailand, anywhere they can drive the wages into the dirt. Some (not all!!! But some!!) Comments about chinese produced goods are borderline xenophobic without really considering that it isnt China, but the US that creates the horrible factory conditions and encourages costs to be cut as low as possible. Chinese factories have to compete with eachother for US brands to pick them, they're not just jerks trying to screw over one another. They're responding to the market factors created by US industry\n\nSorry I just kinda went off a bit but every time I see posts saying \"tHis bRAnD is alIBabA TrASh\" I go into angry-supply-chain-explanation-mode and my eyes turn red. \n\nAlso, why do people think Nordstrom is luxury? It seems just like any department store to me, is there some sort of department store hierarchy I dont know about? Where is Von Marr on the hierarchy? Because they're my favorite. They have nursing rooms with rocking chairs so I think they're the coolest\n\nAlso also, I too loved to swipe the malin and goetz from the hotel when leaving.

It’s a common thing to do, brands making lesser quality / differing color ways to be sold at outlets.\n\n#### Comment ID g158vrx with +4 score by [(agent_m80, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g158vrx/) (in reply to ID g14n4lv):\nAbound is a rack-only, NPG (in-house) brand in the juniors department. They are usually around $20 retail I think at full-price. They \\*are\\* cheap looking dresses, but they aren't pretending at luxury here. These are items on super clearance at Nordstom's discount outlet, they probably just want them out the door. Since the clothes are manufactured by Nordstrom, they can either sell NPG items at a higher markup (which you can find in full price stores, with better materials) or at a lower price (at rack). Nordstrom tries to be pretty careful with their overseas manufacturers, but they are still overseas manufacturers. They are probably still turning a low profit on these dresses or selling them at cost (I have seen clearances lose money because I have seen markups, but this is probably not that). So there is something to be said about the ethics of a profitable $5 dress, but probably for a different subreddit.\n\n## Comment ID g14kxv9 with +5 score by [(radbu107, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14kxv9/) (in reply to ID i7wd1s):\nTo add to this, what do you guys think about Oryza eyeshadow that is offered through Ipsy?

To us, it's \"you're gonna get such a good deal!\" whereas to brands it's \"you're going to get so many loyal customers by selling at an initial discount!\"\n\nIt's optional to believe this part of my post here as I can't back up in-person experiences with receipts, but: I actually met with a small brand founder whose products had been featured in a beauty box. This founder told me that they got a LOT of reviews from this move but not a lot of sales. Which...I could have guessed that part. But said founder was truly surprised by this.\n\nOf course you all know that we sub to boxes for deals, not for loyalty per say (or I'm speaking personally lol, I'll switch brands based on better prices!) \n\nNow with Byroe, my experience is more limited - but from my interactions, I'd say they really are aiming for a luxury brand (it's not Alibaba repackaged). Are their prices absurd? I mean...what luxury brand isn't? La Mer? ReVive? The price tags are goofy to me as someone who uses The Ordinary. But it's still in line with other luxury, and the experience is definitely in line with those brands as well.\n\nSo tbh I was surprised to see Byroe in Boxy but I've got two possible conclusions: either they hope to gain more popularity or they're selling their products at a markdown to maintain freshness (which is actually great, the brand is pretty young).\n\n## Comment ID g14g4sv with +2 score by [(e925, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14g4sv/) (in reply to ID i7wd1s):\nNo pun intended with the Point of View comment 😂\n\n## Comment ID g14m7lx with +1 score by [(MariposaSunrise, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14m7lx/) (in reply to ID i7wd1s):\nI usually use Sephora as my test to see if it is a high quality luxury brand.\n\n### Comment ID g14q21y with +7 score by [(e925, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14q21y/) (in reply to ID g14m7lx):\nFor sure - there are a lot of good brands at Ulta too!

Start by making a wishlist or two. I suggest making two wishlists, one for your actual regular shopping, and one that includes anything you want to track. Then in the app, turn on \"Notify me when an item goes on sale or comes back in stock.\"\n\nThen, Nordstrom sends you a notification when anything on your list(s) get reduced in price. And the 'back in stock' is a game changer during clearance time. When people cancel their orders, or stock was updated in a store and added back to inventory, you get a notification. I have picked up a few items I missed the first time thanks to this second one. \n\nNordstrom Rack as of now does not have this feature, but fingers crossed moving forward. \n\nI think shopbop is supposed to do the same with your hearts and lists, but I have only received emails about my cart from them, so I am not sure what the deal is. I do love how your hearts becomes a custom catalog though, so I am not complaining. :)\n\nDo you have any tips for shopping your fave store?

I usually go for J Brand, but I know they have the brands you listed as well.  You can find pairs in like new condition for $15, sometimes even new with tags for $20.  Sometimes I've noticed they do get a bunch of one style (with tags) so I wonder if it's from a place like Nordstrom Rack, etc. who just couldn't discount them any further.  And they also do $30 site credit a few times a year (doesn't matter if you're an existing customer, sign up for their emails), so you can get almost 2 pairs for the cost of shipping.  And side note, my local Goodwill is in a metro suburb with a little bit of $, and they get great brands. I just saw a pair of Paige jeans there the other week for $7.

My advice would be to get the lucky brand ones when they go on sale, you can stack some sales and get things for a great price! Plus i worked for them for a while though i really hate their corporate and wasteful ways they do have good quality stretchy and breathable denim in different fabric mixes and cuts for what ever you are looking for",

(NYSE: JWN) today announced it has signed a definitive agreement under which Erik, Pete, Jamie Nordstrom and other members of the Nordstrom family (collectively, the \"Nordstrom Family\") and El Puerto de Liverpool, S.A.B. de C.V. (\"Liverpool\") (BMV: LIVEPOL) will acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Nordstrom not already beneficially owned by the Nordstrom Family and Liverpool in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $6.25 billion on an enterprise basis. Following the close of the transaction, the Nordstrom Family will have a majority ownership stake in the Company.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Nordstrom common shareholders will receive $24.25 in cash for each share of Nordstrom common stock they hold. The merger consideration represents a premium of approximately 42% to the Company's unaffected closing common stock price on March 18, 2024, the last trading day prior to media speculation regarding a potential transaction. In addition, the Board intends to authorize a special dividend of up to $0.25 per share (based on Nordstrom's cash on hand) immediately prior to and contingent on the close of the transaction. Upon completion of the transaction, Nordstrom will become a private company.\n\nThe Nordstrom Board of Directors, with Erik and Pete Nordstrom recusing themselves, has unanimously approved the proposed transaction upon the unanimous recommendation of a special committee of independent and disinterested directors that led the review and negotiation of this transaction. The special committee, composed of Kirsten Green, Amie Thuener O'Toole and Eric Sprunk, was formed in February 2024 in response to interest expressed by Erik and Pete Nordstrom in exploring a possible transaction during the Board's most recent evaluation of possible avenues to enhance shareholder value.\n\n\"The special committee of the Nordstrom Board of Directors reviewed this proposal against the Company's standalone prospects for growth,\" said Eric Sprunk, chairman of the special committee. \"Following a rigorous and independent evaluation and consultation with outside financial and legal advisors, the special committee unanimously concluded that this transaction offers greater value for all public shareholders at a significant premium to the unaffected share price.\"\n\n\"The Nordstrom Board regularly considers alternatives to enhance value, culminating in this most recent process,\" added Brad Tilden, chairman of the Nordstrom Board. \"I want to thank the special committee for their diligent and thorough work evaluating and negotiating this transaction over the past several months.\"\n\n\"For over a century, Nordstrom has operated with a foundational principle of helping customers feel good and look their best,\" said Erik Nordstrom, chief executive officer of Nordstrom. \"Today marks an exciting new chapter for the business. On behalf of my family, we look forward to working with our teams to ensure Nordstrom thrives long into the future.\"\n\n\"We're grateful to the employees, customers and shareholders who have shaped Nordstrom into the company it is today,\" said Pete Nordstrom, chief brand officer of Nordstrom. \"Since our founding in 1901, we have been committed to providing our customers with the best possible service – and to improving it every day. We look forward to building on that commitment in this next phase of the Company's evolution.\"\n\n\"Nordstrom is one of the worldwide leaders in department store retailing, and we're thrilled to be investing in a company that has meaningfully shaped the industry for nearly 125 years,\" said Graciano F. Guichard G., executive chairman of the Board of Directors of Liverpool. \"We are honored to partner with the Nordstrom Family and the Company's talented team as they continue to deliver outstanding service to customers.\"\n\nTransaction Details\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory and other conditions, including approval of holders of two-thirds of the Company's common stock and the holders of a majority of the shares of the Company not owned by the Nordstrom Family or Liverpool or their respective affiliates and the Company's directors and Section 16 officers.\n\nThe transaction will be financed through a combination of rollover equity by the Nordstrom Family and Liverpool, cash commitments by Liverpool, up to $450 million in borrowings under a new $1.2 billion ABL bank financing, and Company cash on hand.

(NYSE: JWN) today reported second quarter net earnings of $122 million, or earnings per diluted share (\"EPS\") of $0.72, and earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\") of $190 million. Excluding a charge primarily related to supply chain asset impairment, the Company reported adjusted EBIT of $244 million and adjusted EPS of $0.96.1\n\nFor the second quarter ended August 3, 2024, net sales increased 3.4 percent versus the same period in fiscal 2023, and total Company comparable sales increased 1.9 percent. Gross merchandise value (\"GMV\") increased 3.5 percent. Anniversary Sale timing, with one week shifting from the third quarter to the second quarter, had a positive impact of approximately 100 basis points on net sales compared with 2023. During the quarter, Nordstrom banner net sales and comparable sales each increased 0.9 percent. Net sales for Nordstrom Rack increased 8.8 percent and comparable sales increased 4.1 percent.\n\n\"Our second quarter results were solid, and we're encouraged by the continued topline strength in both banners and the progress we're making to expand gross margin and increase profitability,\" said Erik Nordstrom, chief executive officer of Nordstrom, Inc. \"We're confident in our outlook for the remainder of the year and look forward to sustaining the momentum we've built as we execute on our 2024 priorities.\"\n\nIn the second quarter, active, women's apparel, beauty and kids had the strongest growth versus 2023. During the Anniversary Sale, including one day that fell in the third quarter, the top growing categories were beauty, active and home.\n\n\"We're pleased with the Anniversary Sale and the enthusiastic response from our loyal customers. They were highly engaged throughout the event and responded favorably to our assortment, experiences and service,\" said Pete Nordstrom, president of Nordstrom, Inc. \"We appreciate our team's continued efforts to help our customers feel good and look their best.\"\n\nAs previously announced, on August 21, 2024, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share, payable on September 18, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 3, 2024.\n\nSECOND QUARTER 2024 SUMMARY\n\nTotal Company net sales increased 3.4 percent and comparable sales increased 1.9 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2023. GMV increased 3.5 percent. The timing shift of the Anniversary Sale, with one day falling in the third quarter of 2024 versus eight days in 2023, had a positive impact on net sales of approximately 100 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNordstrom banner net sales and comparable sales each increased 0.9 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2023. GMV increased 1.1 percent. The timing shift of the Anniversary Sale had a positive impact on Nordstrom banner net sales of approximately 200 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNordstrom Rack banner net sales increased 8.8 percent and comparable sales increased 4.1 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2023.\n\nDigital sales increased 6.2 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2023.

Digital sales represented 37 percent of total sales during the quarter.\n\nGross profit, as a percentage of net sales, of 36.6 percent increased 155 basis points compared with the same period in fiscal 2023, primarily due to strong regular price sales and leverage on higher total sales.\n\nEnding inventory increased 8.3 percent compared with the same period in fiscal 2023, versus a 3.4 percent increase in sales.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses, as a percentage of net sales, of 34.4 percent increased 160 basis points compared with the same period in fiscal 2023, due to a charge primarily related to supply chain asset impairment and a 2023 gain on the sale of a real estate asset, partially offset by leverage on higher sales. Excluding the $54 million charge primarily related to supply chain asset impairment, adjusted SG&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 33.0 percent.\n\nEBIT was $190 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared with $192 million during the same period in fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBIT of $244 million excluded the charge primarily related to supply chain asset impairment.2\n\nInterest expense, net, of $26 million was flat compared with $26 million during the same period in fiscal 2023.\n\nIncome tax expense was $42 million, or 25.7 percent of pretax earnings, compared with income tax expense of $29 million, or 17.2 percent of pretax earnings, in the same period in fiscal 2023. The increase in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was driven primarily by the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nThe Company ended the second quarter with $1.5 billion in available liquidity, including $679 million in cash.\n\nSTORES UPDATE\n\nTo date in fiscal 2024, the Company has opened eleven stores:\n\nThe Company has also announced plans to open the following stores:\n\nThe Company had the following store counts as of quarter-end:\n\nFISCAL YEAR 2024 OUTLOOK\n\nThe Company updated its financial outlook for fiscal 2024, which also now reflects the charge primarily related to supply chain asset impairment and related tax impacts recorded in the second quarter, as well as estimated accelerated technology depreciation impacts expected in the second half of fiscal 2024:\n\nRevenue range, including retail sales and credit card revenues, of 1.0 percent decline to 1.0 percent growth versus the 53-week fiscal 2023, which includes an approximately 135 basis point unfavorable impact from the 53rd week\n\nComparable sales range of flat to 2.0 percent growth versus 52 weeks in fiscal 2023\n\nEBIT margin of 3.0 to 3.4 percent of sales\n\nAdjusted EBIT margin of 3.6 to 4.0 percent of sales3\n\nIncome tax rate of approximately 27 percent\n\nEPS of $1.40 to $1.70, excluding the impact of share repurchase activity, if any\n\nAdjusted EPS of $1.75 to $2.05, excluding the impact of share repurchase activity, if any3\n\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\n\nThe Company's senior management will host a conference call to provide a business update and to discuss second quarter 2024 financial results and fiscal 2024 outlook at 4:45 p.m. EDT today.

      "# [Nordstrom by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2003-04-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom)\nAmerican luxury department store chain\n\nThis article is about the department store chain. For other uses, see Nordstrom (disambiguation).\n\nNordstrom, Inc. ( ) is an American luxury department store chain headquartered in Seattle, Washington, and founded by John W. Nordstrom and Carl F. Wallin in 1901. The original store operated exclusively as a shoe store, and a second location opened in 1923. The growing chain began selling clothing in 1963, and became the full-line retailer that presently exists by 1971. The company founded its off-price Nordstrom Rack division in 1973, and grew both full-line and off-price divisions throughout the United States in the following years. The full-line division competes with department stores including Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, and Saks Fifth Avenue, while the off-price division competes with retailers including the TJX Companies and Ross Stores.[4] Previous expansions beyond the contiguous United States include Puerto Rico (2015–2020) and Canada (2014–2023).\n\nEarly history\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn W. Nordstrom was born on February 15, 1871, in the village Alvik near Luleå in Northern Sweden.[5] In 1887, Nordstrom immigrated to the United States at the age of 16.[5][6] His name at birth was Johan Wilhelm Nordström (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈjuːhɑn ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈnuːr(d)strœm]), which he later anglicized to John W. Nordstrom. After landing in New York, he began working in Michigan and was able to save enough money to purchase a 20-acre (81,000 m2) potato farm in Arlington, Washington.[5] In 1897, he joined the Klondike Gold Rush in Canada's Yukon Territory. After two years of prospecting, he finally struck gold, but sold his disputed claim for $13,000.[5] Returning to Seattle with his newfound wealth, he married Hilda Carlson in 1900 and searched for a business venture.[5]\n\nOperations during 20th century\n\n[edit]\n\nWallin & Nordstrom and Nordstrom Best\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom eventually settled on a shoe store that opened in 1901, called Wallin & Nordstrom.[6] Carl F. Wallin, the co-founder of the store, was the owner of the adjacent shoe repair shop.[5] John and Hilda had five children, three of whom would follow him into the family business, Everett W. (1903), Elmer J. (1904) and Lloyd N. Nordstrom.[7][8]\n\nIn 1928, John W. Nordstrom retired and sold his shares to two of his sons, Everett and Elmer. In 1929, Wallin also retired and sold his shares to them. The 1930 grand opening of the remodeled Second Avenue store marked the change of name to Nordstrom. Lloyd Nordstrom subsequently joined the company in 1933, and the three brothers ran the business together for almost forty years.[9]\n\nBy 1958, Nordstrom had expanded to eight stores in two states but still sold only shoes. Apparel came with its purchase of Best's Apparel of Seattle in 1963, and the company's name was changed to Nordstrom Best.[10]\n\nFollowing renaming to Nordstrom\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1971, the company was taken public on National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ). It was one of the first companies to be listed on the then-newly established stock exchange.[11] It was moved to the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 under the ticker symbol JWN after John W. Nordstrom, its founder.[10]\n\nTheir business continued beyond stores in 1974. On December 5, the National Football League announced the signing of a franchise agreement that would put a team in Seattle, Washington. Representing the family as majority partner of the consortium was Lloyd W. Nordstrom. However, he would never see a game as owner, as he died of a heart attack on January 20, 1976, eight months before the newly christened Seattle Seahawks took the field.[12] With his death, the estate of Mr. Nordstrom would oversee the team, with co-owner and entrepreneur Herman Sarkowsky serving as the team's first chief operating officer.[13][14]\n\nBy 1975, Nordstrom expanded into Alaska (the only time by acquisition) by purchasing Northern Commercial Company and opened its first Nordstrom Rack clearance store in Seattle. A strong northwest regional retailer with sales already approaching $250 million making it the third-largest specialty retailer in the United States, the company opened its first Southern California store at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa in 1978.[15] By the early 1990s, it had opened 26 stores plus Racks in California. Subsequent expansion relied on creating a strongly decentralized regional structure, beginning with the Northeast in the Tysons Corner Center in Virginia (1988), the Midwest in the Oakbrook Center in Illinois (1991), the Southeast in Atlanta (1998), and the Southwest in Dallas (1996). In a new region, the initial store was used as a base for training and recruitment for subsequent expansion, and was usually backed by its own distribution center. From 1978 to 1995, Nordstrom opened a total of 46 full-line department stores.[16]\n\nIn 1976, Nordstrom opened a series of stores called Place Two to sell a more limited selection of apparel in smaller markets. By 1983, there were ten Place Two stores, but the cost of upgrading the smaller stores, especially from a systems perspective, outweighed the benefit, and the division was discontinued.[17] The last two remaining Place Two stores closed on April 1, 1995.[18] In August 1988, the Nordstroms sold the Seahawks to real estate developer Ken Behring and his partner Ken Hofmann for $80 million.[19][20][21]\n\nThe company also expanded into direct sales in 1993, beginning with a catalog division[22] led by John N.'s son Dan that was followed by an e-commerce business. Nordstrom.com's fulfillment and contact centers are located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Seattle, Washington. Currently, it has distribution centers in Ontario, California; Newark, California; Portland, Oregon; Dubuque, Iowa; Upper Marlboro, Maryland; and Gainesville, Florida.\n\nNordstrom FSB, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nordstrom, Inc., is a federally chartered savings bank doing business as Nordstrom Bank. It was formed in 1991 in Scottsdale, Arizona, with its customer contact center in Centennial, Colorado. Nordstrom FSB was formerly known as Nordstrom National Credit Bank and changed its name to Nordstrom FSB in March 2000. The bank offers various banking and credit products, such as Nordstrom Signature VISA, Nordstrom retail credit and debit cards, interest-bearing checking accounts, check cards, and certificates of deposits. It offers Nordstrom customers cards under Nordstrom Rewards – its customer loyalty program – where customers earn points when making purchases with the card at Nordstrom and other retailers.\n\nIn 1995, Nordstrom opened their first store location in New York State.[23] It is located at The Westchester, an upscale shopping mall in White Plains, New York, a suburb of New York City. Nordstrom has since opened stores at Roosevelt Field in Garden City, New York in 1997,[24] and Manhattan in 2019.[25]\n\nBeginning in 1995, the fourth generation of brothers and cousins had been co-presidents for a time. John Whitacre was appointed as the first non-Nordstrom CEO in 1997.[26] In 1998, Nordstrom replaced its downtown Seattle store with a new flagship location in the former Frederick & Nelson building across the street. A two-year renovation of this location was completed in 2016.[27] At 383,000 square feet (35,600 m2), the downtown Seattle location is the chain's largest store. By contrast, the smallest Nordstrom store, as of September 2008, opened in 1980 in Salem, Oregon, with a total area of just under 72,000 square feet (6,700 m2). This location has since closed.\n\nIn 1998, Nordstrom opened its first location in the Southeast at Perimeter Mall in Atlanta, Georgia.[28]\n\nOperations during 21st century\n\n[edit]\n\n2000–2009\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2000, the Nordstrom family reasserted its control, with the sons of Bruce A. (Blake, Erik and Peter) assuming senior roles in the company which they continue to hold.[29] Blake Nordstrom served as sole President of the company from 2000 to 2014 with Erik and Peter joining him as co-Presidents in 2015.[30]\n\nNordstrom sold its stand-alone boutique chain Façonnable in 2007, though it still offers that label in its lineup.\n\n2010–2019\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2011, Nordstrom announced the acquisition of HauteLook, an LA-based online retailer that offers flash sales on designer goods. The deal included Nordstrom paying $180 million in stock and a three-year \"earn-out\" payment based on HauteLook's financial performance.[31] On May 26, 2011, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing the downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, Circle Center Mall location due to declining business at the site. The remaining location on the north side of the city at the Fashion Mall at Keystone as well as the future Nordstrom Rack store in the Rivers Edge Shopping Center, also on the north side, remained as the only two locations in the state. Erik Nordstrom, president of stores at Nordstrom stated, \"We've enjoyed serving our customers in downtown Indianapolis, but unfortunately our business has declined over the long term for some time and despite our efforts to turn things around we don't see the outlook significantly changing.\"[32]\n\nIn August 2011, Nordstrom opened the store Treasure & Bond in SoHo, New York. Intended to test the waters of the tumultuous high-end department store scene in New York, all profits of Treasure & Bond are donated to charity. The customer base of the smaller store is thought to be the younger sisters of the typical Nordstrom customer.[33]\n\nNordstrom announced plans to open a Nordstrom Rack in Milwaukee in 2014.[34] In late November 2012, Nordstrom announced that they would also be opening a full-line Nordstrom Department Store in 2015 in Milwaukee at Mayfair Mall, a half-mile away from the Nordstrom Rack location. Milwaukee was the largest metropolitan area in the country that did not have a Nordstrom until 2015. Such unmet demand was highlighted in Nordstrom's decision to open in the Milwaukee area.[35]\n\nOn January 4, 2013, Nordstrom announced plans for a new location in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan region. The store, to be located at the Ridgedale Center, would be the second in the area. Following the success of its Mall of America opening in 1992, Nordstrom sought to expand in the Twin Cities market.[36] Plans for a Ridgedale Center store were first released in 2007, only to be canceled in 2009.[37] The location eventually opened in September 2015.\n\nNordstrom opened a 138,000-square-foot, two-level, full-line store March 2015 in The Mall of San Juan in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[38] After Hurricane Maria in 2017, the store suffered major water damage and it closed temporarily after the hurricane. Nordstrom reopened the store on November 9, 2018.[39] On May 7, 2020, Nordstrom announced that it would not reopen due to COVID-19 pandemic, leaving this store closed permanently.\n\nIn May 2015, Pete and Erik Nordstrom joined their brother Blake Nordstrom as co-presidents of Nordstrom. This arrangement lasted until Blake Nordstrom's death in January 2019.[40] Before this appointment, Pete Nordstrom was executive vice president and president of merchandising while Erik Nordstrom was executive vice president and president of Nordstrom.com.[40]\n\nNordstrom opened its first Rack location in Philadelphia in the fall of 2014.[41] In the fall of 2015, Nordstrom opened their first Nordstrom Rack store in Delaware.[42] The company is opening its first full-line store in New York City on April 12, 2018, a three-floor store at 57th Street and Broadway, in the Columbus Circle neighborhood.[43]\n\nIn 2016, Nordstrom entered into a partnership with Tesla Motors under which the automaker opened retail galleries inside the Nordstrom locations in The Grove, Los Angeles, in SouthPark Mall in Charlotte, North Carolina and in Somerset Collection in Troy, Michigan.[44][45]\n\nIn 2016, Nordstrom began selling products from J. Crew, Olivia Palermo + Chelsea28, Adore Me, and Eloquii.[46][47][48][49] In 2017, Nordstrom announced they would be expanding their natural beauty-focused stations.[50]\n\nOn February 2, 2017, Bloomberg News reported that Nordstrom would cease to carry Ivanka Trump's branded fashion line, citing weak sales. The retailer cuts 10 percent of its most poorly performing brands each year. Nordstrom's action came after a boycott campaign against retailers carrying products having Trump family labels.[51][52] President Donald Trump responded with a tweet directed at Nordstrom, condemning the brand for its treatment of his daughter. The company's stock dropped by 0.65% in the aftermath of the tweet before ending the day with a gain of more than 4%. Fortune declared this quick recovery to have broken Trump's market-moving \"tweet curse\".[53][54][55][56]\n\nIn October 2017, Nordstrom launched its first \"Nordstrom Local\" in West Hollywood, which is set to focus on personal shopping and styling, rather than carrying merchandise. In June 2017, Nordstrom Inc.'s founding family, which owned 31.2 percent of the company, said it was looking to take Nordstrom private.[57] In October, the family suspended its efforts, because of trouble completing a financing package.[58] Lenders were asking for 13 percent interest, about twice the typical rate for retailers.[59]\n\nOn January 2, 2019 Blake Nordstrom, co-president of Nordstrom, died suddenly at the age of 58. He was a lifetime employee of his family's company, rising through the ranks until he became a vice-president and then co-president.[60]\n\nIn fiscal year 2019, digital sales reached 33% of total sales, marking a growing transition to online retail.[61]\n\n2020–present\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 3, 2020, Erik Nordstrom became the sole CEO of Nordstrom.[62]\n\nOn March 16, the company announced that effective the following day, all locations would temporarily close during the COVID-19 pandemic.[63] On May 5, Nordstrom began reopening stores and announced that sixteen locations would permanently close by August.[64][65]\n\nIn late September, Nordstrom announced that by the end of 2021, their stores and websites would no longer sell products made from fur or exotic skins.[66]\n\nIn October 2021, Nordstrom announced an agreement with 11 Honoré, an online retailer of plus-sized designer fashion, to sell the company's clothing in Nordstrom stores and on their website.[67]\n\nOn December 23, 2024, Nordstrom announced their plans to take the company private in a deal valued at $6.25 billion. The plan involves selling 49.9% percent of the company to Mexican department store and real estate company El Puerto de Liverpool, with the remaining 50.1% controlling stake being held by the Nordstrom family. On the deal, CEO Erik Nordstrom stated that “Today marks an exciting new chapter for the business. On behalf of my family, we look forward to working with our teams to ensure Nordstrom thrives long into the future.” [68]\n\nNordstrom Canada\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom Canada Retail, Inc. (French: Les Detaillants Nordstrom Canada, Inc.) was the Canadian division of Nordstrom. It was announced on September 13, 2012, opened its first store on September 19, 2014, and closed its final stores on June 13, 2023. In this market, it competed with Canadian department stores including Holt Renfrew, Hudson's Bay, and Simons.[70]\n\nFour full-line Nordstrom stores were announced for the first phase of expansion, with nine full-line stores total expected in the long term.[71] Most of these stores were located in vacated Sears Canada storefronts in Cadillac Fairview-managed shopping centers, including Chinook Centre in Calgary; Rideau Centre in Ottawa; Toronto Eaton Centre in Toronto; and Pacific Centre in Vancouver. The stores at the CF-managed Sherway Gardens and the Oxford-managed Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto were new construction.[72] Of the first four stores announced, the Calgary store was the first to open on September 19, 2014.[73] It was followed by the Ottawa store on March 6, 2015;[74] the Vancouver store on September 18, 2015;[75] and the Sherway Gardens store on September 15, 2017.[76] The Yorkdale store was confirmed on April 8, 2013,[77] and opened on October 21, 2016.[78] The Toronto Eaton Centre was the last of the six stores to be announced on January 15, 2014,[79] however, it was the fourth to open on September 18, 2016.[80]\n\nThe first Nordstrom Rack opened at Vaughan Mills on March 21, 2018; and then a second location in Deerfoot Meadows in Calgary and a flagship location at One Bloor in Toronto opened on May 3, 2018.[81] Nordstrom Rack opened three other additional stores in Fall 2018; one at Heartland Town Centre in Mississauga, one at Ottawa Trainyards, and finally one at South Edmonton Commons.\n\nOn March 2, 2023, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing all their Canadian stores, which would entail 2,500 staff losing their jobs. The company stated, \"Despite our best efforts, we do not see a realistic path to profitability for the Canadian business.\"[82] The closing will be done under court supervision within the framework of the Canadian Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA), with the help of a third-party liquidator.[83] Liquidation sales began for all locations on March 21, 2023. All Canadian Nordstrom Rack locations closed on May 14, 2023,[84] while all Canadian full-line stores closed on June 13, 2023.\n\nRetail formats\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of May 2022 , there are 100 full-line Nordstrom department stores,[85] which average 140,000 square feet (13,000 m2).[86]\n\nNordstrom holds six annual sales. Two of these are Half-Yearly sales, which take place semi-annually in May and late December, as well as three additional seasonal sales. Nordstrom's largest sale event is the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, which is held each July.[87] Limited amounts of merchandise set to be released for the following fall are sent to Nordstrom stores early, where they are sold at discount. For ten days prior to Anniversary Sale, Nordstrom gives early access to members who make appointments.[88]\n\nNordstrom Local\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom Local service hubs are oriented for amenities including online order pickup, personal styling, and tailoring. They do not have their own inventory, and instead source merchandise from full-line stores as needed. As of May 2022 , there are seven Nordstrom Local locations between New York City and Los Angeles,[85] which average 3,000 square feet (280 m2).[86]\n\nRestaurants\n\n[edit]\n\nFast casual and full-service restaurants operate within most Nordstrom full-line stores.[89]\n\nList of Nordstrom restaurants[90] Restaurant Concept type Year\n\ndebuted Notes Bar Verde 2013 Bistro Verde Bazille Broadway Bar Bar Located within New York City flagship store Burger Bar American 2022 Located within New York City flagship store Cafe Bistro Cafe Nordstrom Classic Cafe 1980 Rebranded as Marketplace Cafe in 1998 Ebar Coffeehouse Gelato Bar 2016 Located in Ala Moana Center store Habitant Bar 2013 Hani Pacific Hawaiian 2019 Previously located within New York City flagship store Jeannie's Pizza 2019 Marketplace Cafe Comfort food 1998 Rebranded from Classic Cafe Milk Bar Bakery 2019 Located in New York City men's store Nordstrom Grill American NYC Clubhouse Bar Located in New York City men's store Oh Mochi Mochi donuts Ruscello Mediterranean Shoe Bar Bar Sweet Sundae Bar Dessert Wolf Italian 2019 Located within New York City flagship store\n\nNordstrom Rack\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Nordstrom Rack\n\nNordstrom Rack originated as a bargain basement in the downtown Seattle flagship store in 1973.

      "# [Retail mogul Bruce Nordstrom dies, aged 90 by Ana Faguy on 2024-05-20](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-69038112)\nBruce Nordstrom, the executive who helped grow the US department store Nordstrom into one of the country's largest retailers, died on Saturday at his home.\n\nHe was 90 years old.\n\nMr Nordstrom was among the third generation of leaders in his family business, who assumed control in 1968.\n\nHis sons, who now run the company, described their father as a \"legendary business leader\", in a statement confirming his death.\n\nNordstrom, co-founded by Mr Nordstrom's grandfather in 1901, started as a Seattle-based shoe shop. As of October 2023, the company operates 360 stores in the US.\n\nMr Nordstrom sat at the helm for decades, retiring as an executive in 1995 and later, in 2006, retiring from Nordstrom's board of directors.\n\nMuch of the retail outlet's growth came at the hands of Mr Nordstrom including the decision to take the company public in 1971 and the decision to launch a lower-priced version of the department store called Nordstrom Rack.\n\n\"Our dad leaves a powerful legacy as a legendary business leader, a generous community citizen and a loyal friend,\" said a statement from his sons, Nordstrom CEO Erik Nordstrom and Pete Nordstrom, the company's president.\n\nAlong with his two sons, Bruce is survived by his wife, Jeannie, his sister Anne Gittinger and seven grandchildren.",
      "# [Nordstrom family strikes deal to take company private by Beth Duckett, Brian Warmoth, Mary Meisenzahl, Bloomberg report, Abbas Haleem on 2024-12-27](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/12/27/nordstrom-family-strikes-deal-to-take-company-private/)\nNordstrom is returning to its roots as a private company. The founding family of the iconic department store chain, in partnership with Mexican retailer El Puerto de Liverpool, has finalized a $6.25 billion all-cash deal to acquire the company. Recently approved by Nordstrom’s board, the deal values shares at $24.25 each and includes existing debt.\n\nThe agreement marks the Nordstrom family’s second attempt to go private after a failed bid nearly seven years ago. For the retailer, the move offers more flexibility to pursue long-term growth strategies — including in ecommerce — without the pressure of quarterly financial reporting.\n\nNordstrom ranks No. 23 in Digital Commerce 360’s Top 1000 Database of the largest online retailers in North America, where it falls under the Apparel & Accessories category. The retailer operates the Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brands. Digital Commerce 360 projects Nordstom’s online sales will reach $5.28 billion in 2024.\n\nNordstrom web sales by year\n\nNordstrom family’s second attempt to take company private\n\nFounded in 1901 as a Seattle-based shoe store, Nordstrom went public in 1971. This is the second buyout attempt by the Nordstrom family, following a 2018 bid valued at $8.4 billion, which was rejected by the board.\n\nIn February 2024, Nordstrom’s board formed a special committee of independent directors after CEO Erik Nordstrom and president Peter Nordstrom expressed renewed interest in taking the company private. At the time, the family owned 33.4% of the company, while El Puerto de Liverpool held a 9.6% stake, acquired in 2022 for approximately $300 million.\n\nBy September 2024, the family and Liverpool proposed a $23-per-share buyout offer. After review, the board approved a revised offer of $24.25 per share — a 42% premium over the stock’s price on March 18, when reports of the buyout first emerged.\n\nErik and Peter Nordstrom recused themselves from the final vote, and the board unanimously approved the transaction.\n\n“Following a rigorous and independent evaluation and consultation with outside financial and legal advisors, the special committee unanimously concluded that this transaction offers greater value for all public shareholders at a significant premium to the unaffected share price,” said Eric Sprunk, who is chairman of the special committee and former COO of Nike, in a statement.\n\nNordstrom deal’s financing details\n\nUnder the agreement, the Nordstrom family will own 50.1% of the company, while Liverpool will hold 49.9%.\n\nThe deal will be financed through:\n\nA mix of equity contributions from the Nordstrom family and El Puerto de Liverpool\n\nCash commitments from Liverpool\n\nUp to $450 million in new borrowings under a $1.2 billion asset-backed loan\n\nCompany cash reserves\n\nNordstrom’s existing $2.7 billion in debt will remain in place after the transaction.\n\nAs part of the deal, Liverpool will gain a seat on Nordstrom’s board, giving the Mexican retailer more influence over strategic decisions. Liverpool ranks No. 30 in Digital Commerce 360’s Top 1000, with 2024 online sales projected to hit $3.89 billion.\n\nThe deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory approval.\n\nEcommerce and digital growth remain a focus\n\nThe deal comes as Nordstrom works to enhance its ecommerce business and drive digital growth.\n\nEarlier this year, the company announced a new online marketplace on Nordstrom.com and an enhanced search feature. The marketplace broadens its product selection, with more brands, sizes, and styles, while giving partners like Mulberry and Adore Me increased visibility.\n\nRecent sales performance paints a mixed picture. For the 2023 fiscal year ending Feb. 3, 2024, Nordstrom reported $14.22 billion in total sales, down from $15.08 billion in 2022. Online sales made up 36% of total Nordstrom sales for the year.\n\nHowever, the company showed growth across the first three quarters of fiscal 2024:\n\nQ1: Net sales rose 5.1% year over year for the quarter ended May 4.\n\nQ2: Net sales increased 4% to $3.79 billion, with digital sales accounting for 37% of revenue, up from 36% the previous year.\n\nQ3: Net sales climbed 4.6% to $3.3 billion for the quarter ended Nov. 2. Digital sales grew 6.4%, with online successes particularly visible at Nordstrom Rack, according to the retailer.\n\nNordstrom Rack continues to play a key role in the company’s growth. Rack launched the option for buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS) at more than 100 locations in Q3. Since the start of fiscal 2024, Nordstrom has opened 23 Nordstrom Rack stores and plans to open at least 15 more in 2025.\n\nDo you rank in our databases?\n\nSubmit your data and we’ll see where you fit in our next ranking update.\n\nSign up\n\nStay on top of the latest developments in the online retail industry.

      "# [Nordstrom family may try again to take the company private by Daphne Howland on 2024-04-19](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstrom-family-may-try-again-to-take-the-company-private/713679/)\nDive Brief:\n\nNordstrom’s board of directors has formed a special committee of “independent and disinterested directors” to “carefully evaluate any proposal from Erik and Pete Nordstrom and any proposals from other parties and consider whether they are in the best interests of Nordstrom and all shareholders,” per a company press release.\n\nThe Nordstrom brothers had notified the board in February of their interest in “potential equity financing for a ‘going private transaction,’” according to a Thursday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nErik Nordstrom, who is CEO, owns 7.45% of the company’s outstanding shares; Pete Nordstrom, who is president and chief brand officer, owns 7.41%; and other family members also own shares.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nDespite its reputation for stellar customer service, innovation and appealing assortments, Nordstrom hasn’t escaped the troubles that many department stores find themselves in — losing sales and ceding market share.\n\nThe retailer in recent years has shrunk its full-line fleet, exiting Canada entirely and opting to shutter 16 stores permanently during the height of the pandemic. In the meantime, it has greatly expanded its off-price Rack business, which many analysts see as volatile and lagging behind stalwarts like TJX and Ross.\n\n“It is no secret that over the past few years Nordstrom has struggled,” GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in emailed comments. “Against this backdrop, the company value has shrunk, and Nordstrom has come under more pressure from investors. This will have caused pain to the founding family, many of whom still run the company, and seems to have rekindled their desire to take the chain private where they can operate away from the daily scrutiny of markets.”\n\nThe family attempted that six years ago, but its offer of $50 per share was rejected by the board as inadequate. At press time, shares are trading for less than $19. Still, it could be difficult to raise the necessary capital given today’s tight market, according to Saunders.\n\nMacy’s recent troubles may also be on the Nordstroms’ minds. That department store has been forced to reckon with investors agitating to unlock value from its real estate, who have offered $6.6 billion to take that department store over. Activist investors swooping onto Nordstrom in a similar fashion “would be an anathema to [the Nordstroms’] general ethos of doing business and by taking the company private they can safeguard its legacy,” Saunders said.\n\nErik and Pete’s great-grandfather, John W. Nordstrom, launched the business as a shoe store in Seattle in 1901. The company went public in 1971, with “JWN” as its stock ticker. Bringing the company back to firmer family control and out of the public markets could give Nordstrom the breathing room it needs to turn the business around, though taking on too much debt could hamper that, too, Saunders warned.\n\nReports that the Nordstrom family might want to take the company private surfaced last month, though the company at the time said it wouldn’t comment on rumors or market speculation.\n\nThe Nordstroms revealed their intentions while the board was evaluating various possible strategic alternatives that could enhance shareholder value, according to the company’s press release Thursday. The board’s new special committee has hired Morgan Stanley & Co. and Centerview Partners as financial advisors, and Sidley Austin and Perkins Coie as legal counsel.",
      "# [Nordstrom to close 2 Massachusetts locations by Thea DiGiammerino on 2025-01-07](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/nordstrom-massachusetts-closures/3595282/)\nNordstrom will close two Massachusetts locations in the coming months, a company spokesperson confirmed Tuesday.\n\nThe Northshore Mall Nordstrom store in Peabody and the South Shore Plaza Nordstrom store in Braintree will close as their leases expire, a company spokesperson said. The last day in Peabody will be January 31, 2025, and in Braintree, March 8, 2025.\n\n\"We believe we’ll be best able to serve customers in the area by leveraging our surrounding stores and through our digital channels. Decisions like this are never easy and we understand the impact they have on our team members. We’re committed to taking care of our employees through this transition, which includes supporting those that are interested in finding another role within Nordstrom,\" the spokesperson said in an email to NBC10 Boston.\n\nLori Sarofeen, who works in the cosmetics department in Peabody, said it’s disappointing news.\n\n“Didn’t expect to come to work hearing that. And it’s closing in like three weeks.”\n\nShe said it’s not that surprising, given that the nature of retail has changed over the years. She said she learned of the closure when she showed up at work Tuesday and does not yet know if she'll be able to relocate.\n\nElsa Zangari, who works in the beauty department, agreed, saying she believes more and more stores are closing as people shop online.\n\n\"Everyone's shopping online so they don't feel they have to come into the store,\" she said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many employees will be impacted by the closures, or how many will be able to relocate.\n\nSimon, which owns the mall properties, said the spaces will be filled by a DICK's House of Sport at the Northshore Mall and a DICK's Sporting Goods at the South Shore Plaza, scheduled to open in 2026.",
      "# [Nordstrom to open more Indochino shop-in-shops by Tatiana Walk-Morris on 2024-07-26](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstrom-indochino-expand-shop-in-shops/722494/)\nDive Brief:\n\nAlong with new showroom openings, Indochino is expanding its partnership with Nordstrom with more shop-in-shops. The DTC apparel brand on Thursday said it will now offer its made-to-measure suiting experience within the department store’s location in Cerritos, California; Thousand Oaks, California; Irvine, California; Pentagon City, Virginia; and Lynnwood, Washington.\n\nSince launching their collaboration in 2020, the latest expansion brings the total Indochino shop-in-shops in Nordstrom to 32, placing the custom clothing brand within 50 miles of more than 90% of U.S. shoppers, according to a company press release.\n\nThe shop-in-shops will have Indochino Style Guides to assist customers in creating custom-tailored suits, shirts, chinos and outerwear, per the press release.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nIndochino’s shop-in-shop openings add to the DTC apparel brand’s brick-and-mortar expansion efforts. This month, the company said it planned to open five additional U.S. showrooms by the end of September in South Carolina, Texas, New York, Utah and California.\n\nThe new shop-in-shops at Nordstrom will not only allow the brand to reach more customers, but the expansion also indicates “growing demand for personalized fashion,” Indochino CEO Drew Green said in a statement.\n\nFor Nordstrom, the expanded partnership with Indochino builds on its commitment to adding popular DTC brands to its assortment in order to stay relevant with consumers. Over the years, the department store has added brands like Bonobos, Everlane and Reformation to attract more shoppers. In a similar move, Neiman Marcus partnered with ThirdLove, which allowed the intimate’s brand to sell its products at Neiman’s Dallas, Atlanta and Coral Gables, Florida, stores.\n\nAs Indochino grows its physical reach, the brand has continued to build out its product assortment to appeal to more customers. Last year, the company expanded its womenswear offering to all of its locations and online, a move it made after initially announcing its intentions to enter the category in late 2021. Earlier this year, the brand debuted its first ready-to-wear suit collection in showrooms across the U.S. and Canada.",
      "# [Nordstrom to be acquired by Nordstrom family and a Mexican retail group in $6.25 billion deal on 2024-12-23](https://abc7ny.com/post/nordstrom-family-mexican-retail-group-acquire-department-store-625-billion-deal/15697367/)\nSEATTLE -- Century-old department store Nordstrom has agreed to be acquired and taken private by Nordstrom family members and a Mexican retail group in a $6.25 billion deal with the industry being squeezed by discount chains and other competition.\n\nPublic companies are under a lot more scrutiny and if private, Nordstrom may have more leeway in reviving a department store chain that has been attempting to reinvigorate sales for years.\n\nNordstrom shareholders will receive $24.25 in cash for each share of Nordstrom common stock, or about $4 billion in all, representing a 42% premium on the company's stock as of March 18, when reports of a potential transaction was reported by the media.\n\nThe acquiring group will also pick up more than $2 billion in Nordstrom debt.\n\nThe traditional department stores have suffered in the face of withering competition from giants like Walmart and Target, as well as a host of fast-fashion bands and Amazon.com. Nordstrom rivals Macy's and Kohl's have been pressured by major investors to make huge changes in order to return more profit to shareholders.\n\nRELATED: Inside the empty flagship Nordstrom in San Francisco, closing after more than 3 decades\n\nSales at Nordstrom have essentially flatlined over the past decade or so and it announced last year that it was closing all of its Canadian stores and cutting 2,500 jobs as it winds down operations in the country. Nordstrom first announced plans to expand to Canada in 2012 and opened its first store in Calgary at CF Chinook Centre in September 2014.\n\nThe offer announced Monday tops the previous $23-per-share bid that the Nordstrom family and Mexican retail group, El Puerto de Liverpool, made in September.\n\nThe board also plans to authorize a special dividend of up to 25 cents per share, based on Nordstrom's cash on hand immediately prior to and contingent on the close of the transaction.\n\nThe deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025, at which time the company's shares will no longer trade publicly.\n\n\"While a change in ownership does not automatically remedy all of the problems with the department store operation, it will allow the family and their backers to take a long-term view of the business and make necessary investments and changes away from the short-term scrutiny of public markets,\" wrote Neil Saunders, Managing Director of GlobalData, in a note to clients.\n\nNordstrom's board of directors unanimously approved the the proposed transaction, with members Erik and Pete Nordstrom, part of the Nordstrom family taking over the company - recusing themselves from that vote.\n\nFollowing the close of the transaction, the Nordstrom family will have a majority ownership stake in the company.\n\nErik and Pete Nordstrom are the fourth-generation leadership at the Seattle retailer, which was founded in 1901 as a shoe store. Erik is the company's chief executive and Peter is president.\n\nAfter opening 23 new stores so far this year, the company now operates a combined 381 Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack stores in the U.S.\n\nNordstrom shares fell about 1.5% Monday, but they are up 34% this year on rumors of a family takeover. The company's stock is still down considerably from post-pandemic highs above $40 per share.\n\nIn May of this year, Bruce Nordstrom, a retail executive who helped expand his family's Pacific Northwest department store chain into an upscale national brand, died at age 90. He was one of several Nordstrom family members who in 2017 made a push to take the company private, proposing to buy out the 70% of the department store's stock they didn't already own. Those talks failed in 2018 but earlier this year, his sons started another series of buyout negotiations, leading to Monday's announcement."

This decision resulted in approximately 2,500 job losses [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom). Additionally, the company plans to close two locations in Massachusetts in early 2025 as part of its strategy to optimize its store footprint [(NBC Boston, 2025)](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/nordstrom-massachusetts-closures/3595282/).\n\n## Product Overview\n\n### Nordstrom's Retail Offerings\n\nNordstrom operates a diverse range of retail formats, including:\n\n- **Full-Line Stores**: These average 140,000 square feet and offer a wide selection of apparel, shoes, and accessories.\n- **Nordstrom Rack**: An off-price division that provides discounted merchandise, with 249 locations as of May 2022.\n- **Nordstrom Local**: Smaller service hubs focused on online order pickups and personal styling, with no inventory on-site [(Wikipedia, 2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom).\n\nThe company is known for its annual **Anniversary Sale**, which is a significant event for shoppers, offering discounts on a wide range of products, including luxury brands [(Hollywood Reporter, 2024)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/shopping/nordstrom-anniversary-sale-date-early-access-deals-1234975177/).\n\n## Leadership and Management\n\nErik Nordstrom serves as the CEO, while Pete Nordstrom is the President and Chief Brand Officer.
