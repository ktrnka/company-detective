  "summary_markdown": "# About Nordstrom\n\nNordstrom, Inc. is a prominent American luxury department store chain headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The company was founded in 1901 by John W. Nordstrom and Carl F. Wallin, initially as a shoe store. Over the years, Nordstrom expanded its offerings to include clothing in 1963 and became a full-line retailer by 1971. The company operates both full-line department stores and the off-price Nordstrom Rack division, which was established in 1973 [(Wikipedia, 2003-04-22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom).\n\nAs of May 2022, Nordstrom operates 100 full-line stores and 249 Nordstrom Rack locations [(Wikipedia, 2003-04-22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom). The company generates revenue through the sale of luxury apparel, accessories, beauty products, and discounted merchandise at Nordstrom Rack. Nordstrom caters to both B2C customers, including fashion-conscious shoppers seeking quality products, and B2B customers through partnerships, such as the one with Tesla Motors to open retail galleries [(Wikipedia, 2003-04-22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom).\n\nFor the fiscal year ending February 3, 2024, Nordstrom reported total sales of $14.22 billion, with online sales accounting for 36% of total sales [(Duckett et al., Digital Commerce 360, 2024-12-27)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/12/27/nordstrom-family-strikes-deal-to-take-company-private/). The company has shown growth in net sales across the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, with a notable 10.6% increase in sales at Nordstrom Rack [(Singsit, Just-Style, 2024-11-29)](https://www.just-style.com/news/nordstrom-q3-fy24-earnings/).\n\nNordstrom's products are distributed through its full-line stores, Nordstrom Rack locations, and online platforms. The company is known for its annual sales events, such as the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, which offers luxury items at discounted prices and incentivizes customer loyalty through the Nordy Club [(Wikipedia, 2003-04-22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\nErik Nordstrom serves as the CEO of Nordstrom, having taken the role in March 2020. He, along with his brother Pete Nordstrom, who is the President and Chief Brand Officer, has been instrumental in navigating the company through recent challenges and strategic shifts [(Howland, Retail Dive, 2024-12-23)](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstroms-puerto-liverpool-company-private-625b/736220/). Following the acquisition by the Nordstrom family and El Puerto de Liverpool, the family will regain majority control, allowing them to focus on long-term strategies without public market pressures [(Duckett et al., Digital Commerce 360, 2024-12-27)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/12/27/nordstrom-family-strikes-deal-to-take-company-private/).\n\n# News\n\n## Acquisition and Going Private\n\nOn December 23, 2024, Nordstrom announced a deal to be taken private in an all-cash transaction valued at $6.25 billion. The deal involves the Nordstrom family and Mexican retail group El Puerto de Liverpool, with the family retaining a 50.1% stake and Liverpool holding 49.9% [(Duckett et al., Digital Commerce 360, 2024-12-27)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/12/27/nordstrom-family-strikes-deal-to-take-company-private/). This acquisition is expected to provide Nordstrom with more flexibility to pursue long-term growth strategies, particularly in e-commerce, without the pressures of quarterly financial reporting [(Howland, Retail Dive, 2024-12-23)](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstroms-puerto-liverpool-company-private-625b/736220/).\n\n## Financial Performance\n\nFor the fiscal year ending February 3, 2024, Nordstrom reported total sales of $14.22 billion, a decrease from $15.08 billion in 2022. However, online sales accounted for 36% of total sales, indicating a growing reliance on digital channels [(Duckett et al., Digital Commerce 360, 2024-12-27)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/12/27/nordstrom-family-strikes-deal-to-take-company-private/). The company has shown growth in net sales across the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, with a notable 10.6% increase in sales at Nordstrom Rack [(Singsit, Just-Style, 2024-11-29)](https://www.just-style.com/news/nordstrom-q3-fy24-earnings/).\n\n## Challenges and Future Outlook\n\nDespite recent growth in digital sales, Nordstrom has faced challenges in maintaining profitability and adapting to changing retail dynamics. The decision to close two Massachusetts locations in early 2025 reflects a strategic shift to focus on more profitable stores and digital channels [(DiGiammerino, NBC Boston, 2025-01-07)](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/nordstrom-massachusetts-closures/3595282/). Analysts suggest that while the company is not the worst performer in its sector, it has struggled to meet its own past standards in merchandising and operations [(Howland, Retail Dive, 2024-12-23)](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstroms-puerto-liverpool-company-private-625b/736220/).\n\nIn conclusion, Nordstrom's recent acquisition and strategic focus on e-commerce and digital growth position the company for potential recovery and long-term success. However, the challenges of adapting to a rapidly changing retail environment will require continued innovation and strategic decision-making.",

I got Birkenstocks for $18, some $20 Nikes, and a bunch of amazing exercise gear for $10 apiece. 40% off *everything* is really a ridiculous steal.

Everything is on clearance plus an optional 40% off. If you opt out of the 40% off things are refundable, if you chose to go for the extra 40% off, it’s final sale. The one downside is that fitting rooms are closed so you kind of have to know your size if you want to get the 40% off due to final sale. The first day I waited in line for about two hours. It sucked. I did end up going back the next day with my brother so he could buy some clothes, probably waited about an hour this time. I did see people that came in pairs would have one person wait in line while the other one looked around. I personally thought it was a really good sale. To give you an idea of the sales my mom got a lot of quality clothes, pots etc (21 items total) for $160!! My brother got really nice sunglasses that were valued at $100, dress shoes, several pairs of button down shirts, several sweatpants/athletic clothes from champion/nike, and Nike slides for about $180. I got Quay sunglasses for $14.\n\n## Comment ID fvau1gw with +4 score by [(Cheapthrills96, Reddit, 2020-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/hbnjud/is_it_worth_checking_out_the_in_store_nordstrom/fvau1gw/) (in reply to ID hbnjud):\nI went.

I usually get Weekday and Dr. Denim jeans from there, the vanity sizing is minimal since they're not American brands.\n\n#### Comment ID f5mkzkh with +5 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5mkzkh/) (in reply to ID f5lp3s8):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID f5oebr8 with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-10-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5oebr8/) (in reply to ID f5lp3s8):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID f5lpdzp with +2 score by [(todaystartsnow, Reddit, 2019-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5lpdzp/) (in reply to ID f5lp3s8):\nhave you looked at kohls? they are decent quality and have petite fittings as well.\n\n#### Comment ID f5mdlu9 with +2 score by [(ac0380, Reddit, 2019-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5mdlu9/) (in reply to ID f5lp3s8):\nHave you tried shopping in kids?

I’m pretty sure brands like Madewell and Topshop and Reformation don’t make clothes for NR specifically, so there’s a good chance those are the real quality. However, it’s kind of difficult to find garments from those brands that aren’t....kind of ugly. The reason they’re usually found at NR is because they were unpopular and didn’t sell.

They don’t ever seem to have a big enough range in the store to suggest so, it’s almost always a very small selection of what seem like leftovers. It also wouldn’t really be their brand to do that. It’s usually because they didn’t sell, but the good stuff I’ve found has been out of season. Like, I found a nice topshop sweater during summer. It’s really just a crapshoot.

I work for a fashion brand that's sold in Nordstrom and I can guarantee that anything you find at Rack from us is the real deal.  Building out an entirely different and cheaper manufacturing process just to sell at Rack at a lower cost wouldn't be economically practical for us.  \n\nUsually when I find things at Rack from our brand, it's from the past season, whereas what is found in Nordstrom's is the current season.  For example, we're a denim focused brand, so you'll currently find lots of washes from the summer in Rack right now, whereas Nordstroms is only selling from our fall/winter collection. \n\nI can only speak for my brand, but I imagine it is a similar situation for others as well.\n\n### Comment ID f5xhivq with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5xhivq/) (in reply to ID f5xdpgm):\nThanks you for this information.

There is no Burberry made for Nordstrom Rack that will share the same label.

The quality is usually the same especially in denim. The only thing to be cautious of is the clearance items as they often do have defects like a weird cut or length.

Lots of bloggers and Insta - Influencers make a big deal about their Nordi semi-annual sale hauls. You can get some amazing deals if you find items you want at Nordstrom, add them to your wishlist on the app or website, or just keep them in your cart and then when the semi-annual sale comes the discounts will be automatically applied. Of course, it really pays to be a rewards member and/or a card holder because you get access to the semi-annual sale earlier than others. The rewards membership is free and all you have to do is enter your phone number anytime you shop to get \"notes\" and they're pretty easy to get and redeem. \n\nPlus, personal preference, but Nordstrom stores are just the nicest. The layout is consistent and its design team just does such a nice job of making sure the space is open, airy, classy, bright and comfortable. I also think Nordstrom has the best options for makeup and fragrance. It is the only one that carries Jo Malone outside of Sephora in the U.S. which is my favorite fragrance brand. \n\nNordstrom just makes the in-person shopping experience feel really nice. They offer a free personal shopping experience which I have never done but would love to do where you go in and you tell them your size and style and they will pull pieces and curate some looks for you and the only thing you pay is what you end up buying. Its those little services that make a difference in my book.\n\n### Comment ID gzghcrz with +6 score by [(loi_, Reddit, 2021-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/gzghcrz/) (in reply to ID gzfnmw0):\nThank you for this!

My old roommates father was a former C-Suite level officer of Nordstrom. While he was visiting the house one weekend Nordstrom had come up and he told a story of how when Nordstorm was expanding, they'd bought a tire store and turned it into a Nordstrom.\n\nA few weeks after opening, a man walked in the front door and rolled a tire over to the main desk. The man went on about how he'd bought the tire from the previous tenant, and could no longer return it because the tire shop no longer existed. \n\nManager asked how much the tires were. Popped open the register, handed him what must've been a couple hundred in cash, thanked him, and sent the man on his way. \n\nFrom that point forward, Nordstrom has forever had a tire item code in it's database.\n\n## Comment ID gzenvd0 with +83 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-05-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/gzenvd0/) (in reply to ID nkrqd6):\nNordstrom has the best return policy of these!

It really must depend on where you’re located. In my experience (though I’m definitely not a major fashion expert, I have lived and shopped in a few different cities) Bloomingdales is equivalent with Macy’s. Nordstrom is a lot better than both. Saks is definitely the most expensive and definitely does have some higher quality items, but you’re going to be paying for it.\n\nI like Nordstrom the best personally. Even if I was an independently wealthy millionaire, I’m pretty sure that I’d chose to shop with them. Their return policy rocks. If you have a card (maybe even if you don’t, I’m not sure) they give you credits for free alterations which can be really awesome if you find something that you love but doesn’t fit you just right. \n\nI’ve never bothered to do it, but you can call and give a general or specific list of things that you’re looking for (like vacation wear, casual stuff, something to wear to a friend or relatives wedding events, etc). A shopper will get a lot of stuff together and put it aside so that it’s ready for you to look over and try on when you show up. You don’t have to buy any of it either.\n\nWhen I’ve went in just to browse and tried something on, the salesperson always offered to bring me other things if what I had didn’t work. If I said no thanks and didn’t buy anything, they were still friendly and sweet. \n\nIdk, I’ve been to other places where I couldn’t walk for 5 minutes before someone new dying to sell me something would just pop out. I hated that, and haven’t experienced it at nordys.

Bloomingdale’s is Macy’s. It’s the same company. You’re paying for their overpriced Macy’s crap. Nordstrom you get their house brands which include actually decent merchandise that have been around for decades as well as the customer service that goes along with it. Neiman’s probably is considered the more exclusive department store in terms of brands carried, but Nordstrom actually does have the exact same depending on your location. Saks is equivalent to Neiman’s but with shorter in person hours & terrible service. I personally look at how many places have discount chain versions of their stores. They all do minus Neiman’s.

Saks Fifth Avenue is a high end department store but Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's are sort of top of the mid-range, just before you get into the luxury department stores. Some Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom stores are more lower high end though when they are the better flagship stores in like New York and Seattle and what not. These stores have Givenchy, Gucci, Prada and other middle of the high end luxury brands, but not Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Hérmes or Dior level. A typical Bloomingdale's or Nordstrom would have like Emporio Armani, Burberry, Max Mara and other entry-level high end brands as their most expensive brands and it certainly wouldn't be the majority of their stock. Maje, Sandro, Rag and Bone, Vera by Vera Wang, Lucky Brand Jeans, J Brand Jeans and other higher end mid-range contemporary brands are more what you'd find at Bloomingdale's or Nordstrom usually.\n\n\nNeiman Marcus is up there with Saks Fifth Avenue too and is even higher end than Saks Fifth Avenue. I feel like Barneys New York was in-between the level of Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus when it was still around.  Though no department store is as high end as Bergdorf Goodman, which only has one store. All of these department stores is where you find your super high end brands like Chanel, Valextra, Giorgio Armani, J Mendel, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Céline, Oscar de la Renta, Hérmes, Akris and what not that you wouldn't even find at a Nordstrom or Bloomingdale's, even if it was one of their fancier stores.\n\n\nAnd then I'd say Lord and Taylor is below Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's and then Macy's is below that, which is the middle of the mid-range stores and is about as middle class as you can get, price-wise. Lord and Taylor you'd find brands like Diane Von Furstenberg, Emporio Armani, Cynthia Rowley and other labels of this level as the absolute best that you could find luxury-wise and premium-wise. And then at Macy's the most expensive might be Emporio Armani at the tippy top, but more like Calvin Klein white label, MK Michael Kors, Ralph by Ralph Lauren, Kenneth Cole, Cole Haan, BCBG Max Azria and other top of the line mid-range labels, before you start getting into the beginning of properly high end stuff. The same would go for Dillard's too, which seems in-between the levels of Macy's and Lord and Taylor, if I'm not mistaken?\n\n\nAnd then JC Penny, Kohl's and Sear's would be the lower-end of the mid-range and would be considered more working-class stores and you would only find the middle of the middle range brands as rhe absolute best you could find there. There are stores cheaper than these, but they aren't properly what you would call department stores. Places like Target, Kmart and Walmart, where those with very little money shop for clothes.\n\n## Comment ID gzmlirp with +1 score by [(lovelypants0, Reddit, 2021-05-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/gzmlirp/) (in reply to ID nkrqd6):\nNordstrom has great benefits (18 weeks paid maternity leave)",

Should I go ahead and buy them for in-store pickup, go to the store, try them on and then return them if I don't like them? There must be a more efficient way to do this. Shopping for clothes online sucks.\n\n## Comment ID ktxenai with +93 score by [(SnarkyLalaith, Reddit, 2024-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/1b9qft1/silly_question_about_shopping_at_nordstrom/ktxenai/) (in reply to ID 1b9qft1):\nNordstrom has a pretty flexible return policy, so you can also ship to your home and have longer than 30 days to get it back to them. \n\nBut I have done what you said, and used it as an excuse to go there. Because online shopping is one thing, but being able to try on a few items is really nice too. And sometimes things catch your eye that wouldn’t online. Last time I went there, I saw a pair of sneakers that looked a little fun but also comfortable. I walked away and back and away and back, decided to try them, and then splurged on them. They never would have caught my eye online.\n\n### Comment ID ktxvdbn with +8 score by [(WampaCat, Reddit, 2024-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/1b9qft1/silly_question_about_shopping_at_nordstrom/ktxvdbn/) (in reply to ID ktxenai):\nPeople always say this about their return policy and their website makes it seem flexible too.

I worked at Nordstrom a long time ago, and things have greatly changed... but Nordstrom basically created a pick-up department for this. The fulfilling employees don't make commission, so it isn't like when you go and shop with someone, then return the items they helped you pick out. Nordstrom has always been insanely good about returns. That would have been the only downside as a salesperson, and we would still happily do it for you with a smile.\n\nMan, back in my day, people would be so shameless... $200 new years eve shoes bought New Years Eve and returned New Year's day... LOL. Nothing we could say about it.\n\nI would also have some of my personal customers hold items FOREVER, our last size 8 in an UGG (think 2006) lol...\n\nYou may even be able to just send in to return, since you live that far.\n\nBUT, since we are on a \"fashion\" sub... I was a great personal shopper for my guests. I highly recommend Nordstrom if you want real help finding items/don't know what to look for. The customer service is unmatched, and you aren't paying a styling fee or anything. And, you can really wear/try them at home before returning. I got to know my customers really well, and if they were returning something we would try to find something better. I always wanted my folks to look great and come back to me for all their needs.\n\nI loved that job. LOL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit to add: if you get to know your salesperson...  will even hide shit for you during anniversary, etc... hehe. We are good to our favorites. <3 <3 Think rare sizes or specific colors/fits, brands...\n\n### Comment ID ktz589h with +6 score by [(jitterbugperfume99, Reddit, 2024-03-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/1b9qft1/silly_question_about_shopping_at_nordstrom/ktz589h/) (in reply to ID ktxyvis):\nI’ve had such amazing service there in both the bra department and the makeup department.

This is a great question. We used to do internal transfers from other stores for free all the time… I’m not sure how they have adapted for e-commerce. I don’t think they will do it, only because shipping is free online.\n\nIn this case, I would find a gal that looks similar in proportions that just works there. They should be asking everyone if they need help (how I know things have changed) right when they get there. Just tell them this exactly, there are tons of pieces you want to try and don’t want to order things only to return. And doesn’t have to only be clothes… we are talking makeup, lingerie, shit, home goods! We cross sell, they can take you around the whole store. You don’t need a “stylist” appointment. We were all stylists. If they are good at their job they will blow you away.\n\nI was a solid 31 waist and that was overweight back then… (many things did stop at 30, size 10/12) I would get folks asking me for help for those reasons and I would take them all around the store. I knew which brands ran big and could easily fit me, and which ones didn’t. Esp mothers with young ladies… those were my best days, when we found cute as fuck clothes for a teen who hated shopping. \n\nI would probably just order things from online and return unfortunately.

And they are merchandising brands that have plus and straight - with all their stuff together.  \n\nMy local store carries plus in store (I am more like 18/20) and I found that all of the stores in my area had some. But one store aimed for a younger audience than the other and had way better stuff.  Jeans tend to be well stocked at all stores. But there were some more fun dresses and non-work wear at the other store. \n\nThey do a better job stocking in store than other brands.

I shop at Nordstrom frequently because I have the credit card and I get points to spend there. For me, I cannot for the life of me figure out if something is flattering,  comfortable, and fits the circumstances in which I would wear it unless I try it on at home. I will wear a garment for half an hour or so to figure it out. Whatever I don't like, or if I need a different size, I return in store. While I'm there I'll purchase items i didn't need to try on.

It's not the miracle I was hoping for- I was imagining someone bringing me whole, interesting outfits including shoes to try on. What actually happened on my first appointment was we communicated by text a few times and I gave her a list of types of things I wanted plus my sizes and some preferred brands.  \n\nWe scheduled an appointment. When I got there she had a huge dressing room set up for me with SO MANY CLOTHES!  Most were variations of what I had requested, with a few unexpected more casual items too. She pretty much just left me to try stuff and came back 2-3 times to see if I needed different sizes, etc. There wasn't any help actually styling outfits but it did save me the time of going through and finding things.\n\nI went mostly to find business formal pieces as I had been WFH for a couple years and my things felt dated. She had a ton of different options of black suits and a bunch of blouses.  It was like looking in my existing closet. She did find a few casual items that I wouldn't have tried on my own but loved.  I ended up spending $500-600 on things. I have since used her 2 more times but only for specific events (I needed a dress for a wedding, etc).\n\nI still recommend trying it as an option- I think a lot depends on the stylist you get. It's free and saves you time. \n\nI had much more success using a stylebox service called FrontDoor Fashion. You can order a box of things to try on and they send you about 10-12 items, put together in actual outfits.  It's much more personalized that something like Stitchfix. The items are more expensive but you have a stylist who is in contact with you v things being picked via an algorithm. It's a $100 deposit but if you keep nothing I believe you get it back.  I've never kept nothing though!  I've gotten great items and it’s how I found my recent interview suit. If you choose to keep the same stylist the boxes really do get better as they learn your style.  My stylist will contact me sometimes randomly and send a pic of an item she thinks I'll like and ask if I want to try it.\n\n### Comment ID ku3p1d8 with +2 score by [(Loveandeggs, Reddit, 2024-03-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionwomens35/comments/1b9qft1/silly_question_about_shopping_at_nordstrom/ku3p1d8/) (in reply to ID ktxwm1c):\nYeah I haven’t had good luck with the in-store stylist either.

      "# Post ID i7wd1s: I assumed being sold at Nordstrom meant a brand was a high-quality, luxury brand. Turns out Nordstrom.com is just a marketplace (like Amazon or Walmart.com) where anybody can sell. with +108 score by [(e925, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/)\n**Edit: Ok not ANYBODY who wants to sell there can sell there. But they aren’t as choosy and bougie as one might think. The takeaway is this: If you, like me, equate the name “Nordstrom” with high-quality, luxury brands (like Nordstrom used to carry exclusively), that is no longer the case.** \n\n**Because something has been sold at Nordstrom Rack (like Byroe), it does not mean it was once sold at Nordstrom and just went on clearance. Just because something is sold at Nordstrom (or Nordstrom Rack), it no longer should imply quality or luxury, like my poor-person brain thought it still did. Oh, and don’t pick the Byroe serum. The ingredients are terrible.**\n\nI recently saw a post about how Grace & Stella (an admitted private label company) is now selling their products at Nordstrom. \n\nThis made me remember the times that I’ve questioned a brand’s legitimacy, only to be reassured of their quality when I saw the products were available to purchase at Nordstrom (a luxury retailer).\n\nI once saw somebody comment that the Byroe toner was Boxycharm including a product with an artificially inflated price point, and I defended them by saying, “This is not the same as the $90 brush set situation. They sell Byroe at Nordstrom. $90 is the actual price.”\n\n~~I alsowondered why I had never heard of Malin + Goetz before seeing them in beauty boxes, but when I looked them up, I saw that they were for sale at Nordstrom.com. This led me to believe that Malin + Goetz is a prestige brand.~~\n\nBut when it was brought to my attention that Grace & Stella was being sold at Nordstrom.com, I was like whaaa...? \n\nI know for a fact that Grace & Stella is not a luxury brand. I’m not saying that all private labeling is bad - but when I think of a product being sold at Nordstrom, I assume it’s on par with Jo Malone, Khiel’s, Dior, etc., which I know Grace & Stella is *not*. \n\nSo I did some research, and it turns out [anybody can sell](https://www.acenda.com/content/sell-on-nordstrom) at Nordstrom.com. That’s why I couldn’t find Byroe ~~or Malin + Goetz~~ for sale anywhere else.\n\nJust a PSA, in case anybody else was still looking at Nordstrom as a luxury retailer, aka from a 1990s point of view.\n\nEdit: ok so I was wrong about Malin + Goetz (it shows up at other retailers if you search for that retailer specifically), but I’m doubling down on Byroe. Take today’s Boxycharm choice of [Tomato Serum](https://byroe.com/products/tomato-serum).  The first four ingredients are cheap moisturizers and fillers, and the 5th ingredient is alcohol. Tomato extract is the 47th out of 48 ingredients.

Former Nordstrom corporate employee here. This isn't exactly true. Nordstrom doesn't let just anyone sell products like Amazon or Walmart.  Nordstrom does have a drop ship program, but a vendor still has to pass through a process and a buyer has to want the merchandise. [This list that was referenced](https://www.nordstrom.com/browse/nordstrom-cares/partnership-guidelines) is customer facing, it is definitely not all of the requirements for becoming a drop ship partner. This is a broad overview for curious people. They are not going to state \"you must be a luxury brand\" explicitly on a customer facing page, they are more about creating the \"atmosphere\" of luxury or if they state that a brand is luxury it's usually with a euphemism or about how something feels. I know that their image is what is keeping them afloat in this brutal retail world so I don't think they would throw that away to become an online marketplace.\n\nThey are probably selling Grace and Stella because, as someone else mentioned, they are hype right now, and Nordstrom wanted to cash in on that. Grace and Stella's marketing team is much smarter than face skin's; they have a much better image. I agree that this was a miss for them, and I doubt they would have agreed to the partnership if they knew they were alibaba crap. Nordstrom sold Goop gemstones for like $80 that were \"blessed\" by someone named Heather. They want to jump on trends.\n\n### Comment ID g15i8sa with +3 score by [(pounce_the_panther, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g15i8sa/) (in reply to ID g14xn25):\nAll of the Grace and Stella items I can find are in the Pop Up shop.

Thanks for taking the time to give your input. \n\nI guess my point was this - I was excited for the Byroe toner because I saw it at Nordstrom Rack. \n\nI thought all products at Nordstrom Rack were products that were once sold at Nordstrom and had gone on clearance, so I used the fact that the Byroe toner was on clearance “for $29.97 from $95” [at Nordstrom Rack](https://www.nordstromrack.com/shop/product/3115305/byroe-bitter-green-essence-toner?color=GREEN) as clear evidence that Byroe is a legitimate luxury brand, and the Byroe toner was once sold at Nordstrom proper for $95. \n\nI’m probably not the only person here who thought the Nordstrom name was equivalent to a legitimate product. \n\nIt says 86% off, which gives the impression to me, an un-savvy shopper, that Nordstrom buyers think the Byroe toner is worth $95, because Nordstrom at one point “carried it.” \n\nDoes that make sense? I used the Nordstrom name as evidence of Byroe’s legitimacy when in conversation with others, but I now realize that that was not a valid argument. \n\nThe Byroe Tomato serum is a choice for a Boxy Premium today (and the ingredients are not worth $150), so I still think the post is important, just in case a fellow un-savvy shopper mistakenly assumed that Byroe = Nordstrom = Quality, when it does not mean that in the same way that it used to.\n\n#### Comment ID g15t78k with +15 score by [(Ditovontease, Reddit, 2020-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g15t78k/) (in reply to ID g15cll9):\nNever assume Rack is the same as Nordstrom.

They also have been supplying products to a lot of luxury hotels etc. so it fits that top tier status, in my opinion. It might not be a brand targeted to a young demographic so I don't think they do a lot of social media marketing. You can find them on Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, Sephora, Saks Fifth, their own boutiques and other retailers too. \n2. IDK about Byroe, since I am not interested in their products and haven't come across them.\n3. Grace & Stella is a brand, a millenial/gen-z/IG hyped up brand, that is. I haven't done my research but I would assume Nordstrom sells them because of their following, their \"aesthetic\" and their clout. LOL. So people who are interested in the brand would drive traffic to Nordstrom and perhaps buy other products from Nordstrom too, which gives them more money. Grace & Stella is a brand disguising as a luxury brand... They have good marketers and brand relationship managers to be honest, being able to get this far. Props to them.\n4. To your point, yes you are correct Grace & Stella is not a luxury brand when you compare it to Chanel, Dior and other brands being sold at Nordstrom. However, I also don't think Nordstrom = Walmart, Amazon where it's a free for all marketplace. I'm sure the brands go through an approval process where both parties benefit from the exposure and sales they get from Nordstrom. That's why there is no Wet & Wild or LA Girl there. Grace & Stella sells their stuff on a higher price point than drugstore and are aligning themselves to the likes of Saturday Skin, Youth to the People, Herbivore and other cutesy packaging, millenial reaching skincare brands *hence maybe why* you also see them at Nordstrom.\n\n### Comment ID g14nvrt with +18 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14nvrt/) (in reply to ID g14lg38):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID g14qpad with +12 score by [(biancae1izabeth, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14qpad/) (in reply to ID g14nvrt):\nYeah I'm with you!

Anyone who has had their images stolen by Alibaba and wish sellers knows that the product you're getting is RARELY the same thing as is shown in the picture. The picture is almost always a higher quality item that the cheap wholesale seller is duping. If you want to find instances of this, just take a look at simplynailogical's 500 videos about stolen content on wish - it is a huge problem especially for smaller brands and unknown creators to have their content stolen by online retailers because they have very little excess cash and legal backing to get them taken down. \n\n2 the items that YOU buy off alibaba, even if it seems to be the exact same product as something else, are rarely the same product a private labeler is buying. Private label companies don't log into alibaba and buy a bulk inventory and then repackage the goods. They contact a factory to have items specifically made for their order, often already with their private label on them or entirely unlabeled so that the company can brand them themselves and repackage in higher quality packaging. You can see this with practically all the hair accessories you can buy at any major retailer across the US. It is the same stuff with a different name on it. Theres only so many ways to make a Bobby pin! Private labelers dont automatically have bad quality just because they private label, they're just rebranding existing products and sometimes that product is crap and sometimes it isnt. A huge, well known private labeling company you all know and love is Trader Joe's. The majority of their products are existing products made by other brands relabeled for trader Joe's, sometimes with slight variations just so the trader Joe's one has a different ingredient list. Sometimes they just change the names on the ingredients even so you cant find their dupes, like using the chemical name for banana extract instead of just saying \"banana extract\". There is a big difference between you buying skincare from wish and the brand buying their original unlabeled product, #1 being when they import things to the US under their new private label, their stock is all going to be identical, whereas if you buy two of the exact same items off wish you could end up with two totally different products. Thats because Even private labelers have quality control. I think there is a lot of confusion about this especially on this app because of the one major private label scandal we all know that came up and now everyone thinks all private labelers are trying to poison us, but one of the reasons that story got so big is because they weren't just private labeling, they were doing it very badly and not doing proper quality control, which was the only reason anyone even knew they were a private labeler. Had they done a great job, you probably never would have known. Other private labelers will do everything they can not to make the same mistakes, because they dont want a scandal to marr their brands. Dls probably spends more trying to dig out of the pit from their scandal than they do on any other marketing by creating new brands all the time. They Have to make new brands to survive. No other brand wants to be in the same shoes as dls.\n\n3 almost all products' retail value are roughly 10% material cost, 10% packaging, 20% marketing, and 60% profit margin. The marketing they do isnt always to consumers. They also have to market to retailers to get them to carry their products\n\n4 luxury brands produce products in china too. Everyone does. Huge workforce, low labor and infrastructure costs. It just makes sense if you want to drive your costs down as much as possible. If they're not producing out of china it is from Indonesia, Thailand, anywhere they can drive the wages into the dirt. Some (not all!!! But some!!) Comments about chinese produced goods are borderline xenophobic without really considering that it isnt China, but the US that creates the horrible factory conditions and encourages costs to be cut as low as possible. Chinese factories have to compete with eachother for US brands to pick them, they're not just jerks trying to screw over one another. They're responding to the market factors created by US industry\n\nSorry I just kinda went off a bit but every time I see posts saying \"tHis bRAnD is alIBabA TrASh\" I go into angry-supply-chain-explanation-mode and my eyes turn red. \n\nAlso, why do people think Nordstrom is luxury? It seems just like any department store to me, is there some sort of department store hierarchy I dont know about? Where is Von Marr on the hierarchy? Because they're my favorite. They have nursing rooms with rocking chairs so I think they're the coolest\n\nAlso also, I too loved to swipe the malin and goetz from the hotel when leaving. Them and Crabtree & Evelyn are the two I like to keep\n\n### Comment ID g14nbqc with +21 score by [(grnidgurl, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14nbqc/) (in reply to ID g14lg38):\nGrace & Stella is just a notch above DLS (Dirthy Little Secrets).

They are usually around $20 retail I think at full-price. They \\*are\\* cheap looking dresses, but they aren't pretending at luxury here. These are items on super clearance at Nordstom's discount outlet, they probably just want them out the door. Since the clothes are manufactured by Nordstrom, they can either sell NPG items at a higher markup (which you can find in full price stores, with better materials) or at a lower price (at rack). Nordstrom tries to be pretty careful with their overseas manufacturers, but they are still overseas manufacturers. They are probably still turning a low profit on these dresses or selling them at cost (I have seen clearances lose money because I have seen markups, but this is probably not that). So there is something to be said about the ethics of a profitable $5 dress, but probably for a different subreddit.\n\n## Comment ID g14kxv9 with +5 score by [(radbu107, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14kxv9/) (in reply to ID i7wd1s):\nTo add to this, what do you guys think about Oryza eyeshadow that is offered through Ipsy?

To us, it's \"you're gonna get such a good deal!\" whereas to brands it's \"you're going to get so many loyal customers by selling at an initial discount!\"\n\nIt's optional to believe this part of my post here as I can't back up in-person experiences with receipts, but: I actually met with a small brand founder whose products had been featured in a beauty box. This founder told me that they got a LOT of reviews from this move but not a lot of sales. Which...I could have guessed that part. But said founder was truly surprised by this.\n\nOf course you all know that we sub to boxes for deals, not for loyalty per say (or I'm speaking personally lol, I'll switch brands based on better prices!) \n\nNow with Byroe, my experience is more limited - but from my interactions, I'd say they really are aiming for a luxury brand (it's not Alibaba repackaged). Are their prices absurd? I mean...what luxury brand isn't? La Mer? ReVive? The price tags are goofy to me as someone who uses The Ordinary. But it's still in line with other luxury, and the experience is definitely in line with those brands as well.\n\nSo tbh I was surprised to see Byroe in Boxy but I've got two possible conclusions: either they hope to gain more popularity or they're selling their products at a markdown to maintain freshness (which is actually great, the brand is pretty young).\n\n## Comment ID g14g4sv with +2 score by [(e925, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14g4sv/) (in reply to ID i7wd1s):\nNo pun intended with the Point of View comment 😂\n\n## Comment ID g14m7lx with +2 score by [(MariposaSunrise, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14m7lx/) (in reply to ID i7wd1s):\nI usually use Sephora as my test to see if it is a high quality luxury brand.\n\n### Comment ID g14q21y with +7 score by [(e925, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14q21y/) (in reply to ID g14m7lx):\nFor sure - there are a lot of good brands at Ulta too!

But I don’t go there for makeup or skin care. Just like I don’t go to Trader Joe’s if I’m buying milk and cereal. \n\nI shop Nordstrom Rack for shoes, stuff for the house like candles, accessories, and clothes. And here’s a catch with the clothes, it’s hit or miss and you have to come through the racks. But ultimately, they do have a very good shoe selection.  \n\nAnd just like someone else said, it’s actually better to shop Nordstrom Rack online\n\n## Comment ID m40vgoz with +4 score by [(sryan317, Reddit, 2024-12-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marshallsfinds/comments/1hn0egf/nordstrom_rack_super_stocked_but/m40vgoz/) (in reply to ID 1hn0egf):\nI noticed that most of the beauty stuff is full priced the other day.  I normally check out that section as they tend to keep the higher end candles like Nest, in that section to differentiate it from their 'discount brand\" candles that they make for those types of stores.  I also noticed that in the shoe section they were selling men's Birkenstock shoes for more than they charged on the Birkenstock website.  Nordstrom Rack tends to have better things then like a TJ Maxx/Marshalls but it's not the bargain I once perceived it to be in the past.\n\n## Comment ID m412x9g with +4 score by [(lauti04, Reddit, 2024-12-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marshallsfinds/comments/1hn0egf/nordstrom_rack_super_stocked_but/m412x9g/) (in reply to ID 1hn0egf):\nBeauty stuff at NR is not discounted.\n\n## Comment ID m3z102n with +3 score by [(alexxxisev, Reddit, 2024-12-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marshallsfinds/comments/1hn0egf/nordstrom_rack_super_stocked_but/m3z102n/) (in reply to ID 1hn0egf):\nI have had good luck w Nordstrom Rack online, but never in store\n\n## Comment ID m3z9ge9 with +2 score by [(Similar_Elephant_481, Reddit, 2024-12-27)](https://www.reddit.com/r/marshallsfinds/comments/1hn0egf/nordstrom_rack_super_stocked_but/m3z9ge9/) (in reply to ID 1hn0egf):\nThe deals are better online, more so if you’re in their Nordy club or have a Nordstrom card.

      "# Post ID h9y3ub: Nordstrom App tip and share your best shopping tips as well! with +253 score by [(quietisland, Reddit, 2020-06-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/h9y3ub/nordstrom_app_tip_and_share_your_best_shopping/)\nSince Nordstrom has been having a ton of really good sales - well kinda non-stop since March, just wanted to share some notes about the wish list features they have. Start by making a wishlist or two. I suggest making two wishlists, one for your actual regular shopping, and one that includes anything you want to track. Then in the app, turn on \"Notify me when an item goes on sale or comes back in stock.\"\n\nThen, Nordstrom sends you a notification when anything on your list(s) get reduced in price. And the 'back in stock' is a game changer during clearance time. When people cancel their orders, or stock was updated in a store and added back to inventory, you get a notification. I have picked up a few items I missed the first time thanks to this second one. \n\nNordstrom Rack as of now does not have this feature, but fingers crossed moving forward. \n\nI think shopbop is supposed to do the same with your hearts and lists, but I have only received emails about my cart from them, so I am not sure what the deal is. I do love how your hearts becomes a custom catalog though, so I am not complaining. :)\n\nDo you have any tips for shopping your fave store?  Please share!\n\n## Comment ID fv04gn1 with +51 score by [(spookyholiday101, Reddit, 2020-06-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/h9y3ub/nordstrom_app_tip_and_share_your_best_shopping/fv04gn1/) (in reply to ID h9y3ub):\nI also use Shoptagr for tracking when everything goes on sale! I use the app- I don’t keep notifications on (I’m tracking hundreds of items, so those notifications were a little crazy). I just check the app each morning to see what’s on sale! I don’t buy anything unless it’s on sale!\n\n### Comment ID fv072ml with +7 score by [(quietisland, Reddit, 2020-06-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/h9y3ub/nordstrom_app_tip_and_share_your_best_shopping/fv072ml/) (in reply to ID fv04gn1):\nThank you for sharing this one!

      "# [Nordstrom by Contributors to Wikimedia projects on 2003-04-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom)\nAmerican luxury department store chain\n\nThis article is about the department store chain. For other uses, see Nordstrom (disambiguation).\n\nNordstrom, Inc. ( ) is an American luxury department store chain headquartered in Seattle, Washington, and founded by John W. Nordstrom and Carl F. Wallin in 1901. The original store operated exclusively as a shoe store, and a second location opened in 1923. The growing chain began selling clothing in 1963, and became the full-line retailer that presently exists by 1971. The company founded its off-price Nordstrom Rack division in 1973, and grew both full-line and off-price divisions throughout the United States in the following years. The full-line division competes with department stores including Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, and Saks Fifth Avenue, while the off-price division competes with retailers including the TJX Companies and Ross Stores.[4] Previous expansions beyond the contiguous United States include Puerto Rico (2015–2020) and Canada (2014–2023).\n\nEarly history\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn W. Nordstrom was born on February 15, 1871, in the village Alvik near Luleå in Northern Sweden.[5] In 1887, Nordstrom immigrated to the United States at the age of 16.[5][6] His name at birth was Johan Wilhelm Nordström (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈjuːhɑn ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈnuːr(d)strœm]), which he later anglicized to John W. Nordstrom. After landing in New York, he began working in Michigan and was able to save enough money to purchase a 20-acre (81,000 m2) potato farm in Arlington, Washington.[5] In 1897, he joined the Klondike Gold Rush in Canada's Yukon Territory. After two years of prospecting, he finally struck gold, but sold his disputed claim for $13,000.[5] Returning to Seattle with his newfound wealth, he married Hilda Carlson in 1900 and searched for a business venture.[5]\n\nOperations during 20th century\n\n[edit]\n\nWallin & Nordstrom and Nordstrom Best\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom eventually settled on a shoe store that opened in 1901, called Wallin & Nordstrom.[6] Carl F. Wallin, the co-founder of the store, was the owner of the adjacent shoe repair shop.[5] John and Hilda had five children, three of whom would follow him into the family business, Everett W. (1903), Elmer J. (1904) and Lloyd N. Nordstrom.[7][8]\n\nIn 1928, John W. Nordstrom retired and sold his shares to two of his sons, Everett and Elmer. In 1929, Wallin also retired and sold his shares to them. The 1930 grand opening of the remodeled Second Avenue store marked the change of name to Nordstrom. Lloyd Nordstrom subsequently joined the company in 1933, and the three brothers ran the business together for almost forty years.[9]\n\nBy 1958, Nordstrom had expanded to eight stores in two states but still sold only shoes. Apparel came with its purchase of Best's Apparel of Seattle in 1963, and the company's name was changed to Nordstrom Best.[10]\n\nFollowing renaming to Nordstrom\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1971, the company was taken public on National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ). It was one of the first companies to be listed on the then-newly established stock exchange.[11] It was moved to the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 under the ticker symbol JWN after John W. Nordstrom, its founder.[10]\n\nTheir business continued beyond stores in 1974. On December 5, the National Football League announced the signing of a franchise agreement that would put a team in Seattle, Washington. Representing the family as majority partner of the consortium was Lloyd W. Nordstrom. However, he would never see a game as owner, as he died of a heart attack on January 20, 1976, eight months before the newly christened Seattle Seahawks took the field.[12] With his death, the estate of Mr. Nordstrom would oversee the team, with co-owner and entrepreneur Herman Sarkowsky serving as the team's first chief operating officer.[13][14]\n\nBy 1975, Nordstrom expanded into Alaska (the only time by acquisition) by purchasing Northern Commercial Company and opened its first Nordstrom Rack clearance store in Seattle. A strong northwest regional retailer with sales already approaching $250 million making it the third-largest specialty retailer in the United States, the company opened its first Southern California store at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa in 1978.[15] By the early 1990s, it had opened 26 stores plus Racks in California. Subsequent expansion relied on creating a strongly decentralized regional structure, beginning with the Northeast in the Tysons Corner Center in Virginia (1988), the Midwest in the Oakbrook Center in Illinois (1991), the Southeast in Atlanta (1998), and the Southwest in Dallas (1996). In a new region, the initial store was used as a base for training and recruitment for subsequent expansion, and was usually backed by its own distribution center. From 1978 to 1995, Nordstrom opened a total of 46 full-line department stores.[16]\n\nIn 1976, Nordstrom opened a series of stores called Place Two to sell a more limited selection of apparel in smaller markets. By 1983, there were ten Place Two stores, but the cost of upgrading the smaller stores, especially from a systems perspective, outweighed the benefit, and the division was discontinued.[17] The last two remaining Place Two stores closed on April 1, 1995.[18] In August 1988, the Nordstroms sold the Seahawks to real estate developer Ken Behring and his partner Ken Hofmann for $80 million.[19][20][21]\n\nThe company also expanded into direct sales in 1993, beginning with a catalog division[22] led by John N.'s son Dan that was followed by an e-commerce business. Nordstrom.com's fulfillment and contact centers are located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Seattle, Washington. Currently, it has distribution centers in Ontario, California; Newark, California; Portland, Oregon; Dubuque, Iowa; Upper Marlboro, Maryland; and Gainesville, Florida.\n\nNordstrom FSB, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nordstrom, Inc., is a federally chartered savings bank doing business as Nordstrom Bank. It was formed in 1991 in Scottsdale, Arizona, with its customer contact center in Centennial, Colorado. Nordstrom FSB was formerly known as Nordstrom National Credit Bank and changed its name to Nordstrom FSB in March 2000. The bank offers various banking and credit products, such as Nordstrom Signature VISA, Nordstrom retail credit and debit cards, interest-bearing checking accounts, check cards, and certificates of deposits. It offers Nordstrom customers cards under Nordstrom Rewards – its customer loyalty program – where customers earn points when making purchases with the card at Nordstrom and other retailers.\n\nIn 1995, Nordstrom opened their first store location in New York State.[23] It is located at The Westchester, an upscale shopping mall in White Plains, New York, a suburb of New York City. Nordstrom has since opened stores at Roosevelt Field in Garden City, New York in 1997,[24] and Manhattan in 2019.[25]\n\nBeginning in 1995, the fourth generation of brothers and cousins had been co-presidents for a time. John Whitacre was appointed as the first non-Nordstrom CEO in 1997.[26] In 1998, Nordstrom replaced its downtown Seattle store with a new flagship location in the former Frederick & Nelson building across the street. A two-year renovation of this location was completed in 2016.[27] At 383,000 square feet (35,600 m2), the downtown Seattle location is the chain's largest store. By contrast, the smallest Nordstrom store, as of September 2008, opened in 1980 in Salem, Oregon, with a total area of just under 72,000 square feet (6,700 m2). This location has since closed.\n\nIn 1998, Nordstrom opened its first location in the Southeast at Perimeter Mall in Atlanta, Georgia.[28]\n\nOperations during 21st century\n\n[edit]\n\n2000–2009\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2000, the Nordstrom family reasserted its control, with the sons of Bruce A. (Blake, Erik and Peter) assuming senior roles in the company which they continue to hold.[29] Blake Nordstrom served as sole President of the company from 2000 to 2014 with Erik and Peter joining him as co-Presidents in 2015.[30]\n\nNordstrom sold its stand-alone boutique chain Façonnable in 2007, though it still offers that label in its lineup.\n\n2010–2019\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2011, Nordstrom announced the acquisition of HauteLook, an LA-based online retailer that offers flash sales on designer goods. The deal included Nordstrom paying $180 million in stock and a three-year \"earn-out\" payment based on HauteLook's financial performance.[31] On May 26, 2011, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing the downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, Circle Center Mall location due to declining business at the site. The remaining location on the north side of the city at the Fashion Mall at Keystone as well as the future Nordstrom Rack store in the Rivers Edge Shopping Center, also on the north side, remained as the only two locations in the state. Erik Nordstrom, president of stores at Nordstrom stated, \"We've enjoyed serving our customers in downtown Indianapolis, but unfortunately our business has declined over the long term for some time and despite our efforts to turn things around we don't see the outlook significantly changing.\"[32]\n\nIn August 2011, Nordstrom opened the store Treasure & Bond in SoHo, New York. Intended to test the waters of the tumultuous high-end department store scene in New York, all profits of Treasure & Bond are donated to charity. The customer base of the smaller store is thought to be the younger sisters of the typical Nordstrom customer.[33]\n\nNordstrom announced plans to open a Nordstrom Rack in Milwaukee in 2014.[34] In late November 2012, Nordstrom announced that they would also be opening a full-line Nordstrom Department Store in 2015 in Milwaukee at Mayfair Mall, a half-mile away from the Nordstrom Rack location. Milwaukee was the largest metropolitan area in the country that did not have a Nordstrom until 2015. Such unmet demand was highlighted in Nordstrom's decision to open in the Milwaukee area.[35]\n\nOn January 4, 2013, Nordstrom announced plans for a new location in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan region. The store, to be located at the Ridgedale Center, would be the second in the area. Following the success of its Mall of America opening in 1992, Nordstrom sought to expand in the Twin Cities market.[36] Plans for a Ridgedale Center store were first released in 2007, only to be canceled in 2009.[37] The location eventually opened in September 2015.\n\nNordstrom opened a 138,000-square-foot, two-level, full-line store March 2015 in The Mall of San Juan in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[38] After Hurricane Maria in 2017, the store suffered major water damage and it closed temporarily after the hurricane. Nordstrom reopened the store on November 9, 2018.[39] On May 7, 2020, Nordstrom announced that it would not reopen due to COVID-19 pandemic, leaving this store closed permanently.\n\nIn May 2015, Pete and Erik Nordstrom joined their brother Blake Nordstrom as co-presidents of Nordstrom. This arrangement lasted until Blake Nordstrom's death in January 2019.[40] Before this appointment, Pete Nordstrom was executive vice president and president of merchandising while Erik Nordstrom was executive vice president and president of Nordstrom.com.[40]\n\nNordstrom opened its first Rack location in Philadelphia in the fall of 2014.[41] In the fall of 2015, Nordstrom opened their first Nordstrom Rack store in Delaware.[42] The company is opening its first full-line store in New York City on April 12, 2018, a three-floor store at 57th Street and Broadway, in the Columbus Circle neighborhood.[43]\n\nIn 2016, Nordstrom entered into a partnership with Tesla Motors under which the automaker opened retail galleries inside the Nordstrom locations in The Grove, Los Angeles, in SouthPark Mall in Charlotte, North Carolina and in Somerset Collection in Troy, Michigan.[44][45]\n\nIn 2016, Nordstrom began selling products from J. Crew, Olivia Palermo + Chelsea28, Adore Me, and Eloquii.[46][47][48][49] In 2017, Nordstrom announced they would be expanding their natural beauty-focused stations.[50]\n\nOn February 2, 2017, Bloomberg News reported that Nordstrom would cease to carry Ivanka Trump's branded fashion line, citing weak sales. The retailer cuts 10 percent of its most poorly performing brands each year. Nordstrom's action came after a boycott campaign against retailers carrying products having Trump family labels.[51][52] President Donald Trump responded with a tweet directed at Nordstrom, condemning the brand for its treatment of his daughter. The company's stock dropped by 0.65% in the aftermath of the tweet before ending the day with a gain of more than 4%. Fortune declared this quick recovery to have broken Trump's market-moving \"tweet curse\".[53][54][55][56]\n\nIn October 2017, Nordstrom launched its first \"Nordstrom Local\" in West Hollywood, which is set to focus on personal shopping and styling, rather than carrying merchandise. In June 2017, Nordstrom Inc.'s founding family, which owned 31.2 percent of the company, said it was looking to take Nordstrom private.[57] In October, the family suspended its efforts, because of trouble completing a financing package.[58] Lenders were asking for 13 percent interest, about twice the typical rate for retailers.[59]\n\nOn January 2, 2019 Blake Nordstrom, co-president of Nordstrom, died suddenly at the age of 58. He was a lifetime employee of his family's company, rising through the ranks until he became a vice-president and then co-president.[60]\n\nIn fiscal year 2019, digital sales reached 33% of total sales, marking a growing transition to online retail.[61]\n\n2020–present\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 3, 2020, Erik Nordstrom became the sole CEO of Nordstrom.[62]\n\nOn March 16, the company announced that effective the following day, all locations would temporarily close during the COVID-19 pandemic.[63] On May 5, Nordstrom began reopening stores and announced that sixteen locations would permanently close by August.[64][65]\n\nIn late September, Nordstrom announced that by the end of 2021, their stores and websites would no longer sell products made from fur or exotic skins.[66]\n\nIn October 2021, Nordstrom announced an agreement with 11 Honoré, an online retailer of plus-sized designer fashion, to sell the company's clothing in Nordstrom stores and on their website.[67]\n\nOn December 23, 2024, Nordstrom announced their plans to take the company private in a deal valued at $6.25 billion. The plan involves selling 49.9% percent of the company to Mexican department store and real estate company El Puerto de Liverpool, with the remaining 50.1% controlling stake being held by the Nordstrom family. On the deal, CEO Erik Nordstrom stated that “Today marks an exciting new chapter for the business. On behalf of my family, we look forward to working with our teams to ensure Nordstrom thrives long into the future.” [68]\n\nNordstrom Canada\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom Canada Retail, Inc. (French: Les Detaillants Nordstrom Canada, Inc.) was the Canadian division of Nordstrom. It was announced on September 13, 2012, opened its first store on September 19, 2014, and closed its final stores on June 13, 2023. In this market, it competed with Canadian department stores including Holt Renfrew, Hudson's Bay, and Simons.[70]\n\nFour full-line Nordstrom stores were announced for the first phase of expansion, with nine full-line stores total expected in the long term.[71] Most of these stores were located in vacated Sears Canada storefronts in Cadillac Fairview-managed shopping centers, including Chinook Centre in Calgary; Rideau Centre in Ottawa; Toronto Eaton Centre in Toronto; and Pacific Centre in Vancouver. The stores at the CF-managed Sherway Gardens and the Oxford-managed Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto were new construction.[72] Of the first four stores announced, the Calgary store was the first to open on September 19, 2014.[73] It was followed by the Ottawa store on March 6, 2015;[74] the Vancouver store on September 18, 2015;[75] and the Sherway Gardens store on September 15, 2017.[76] The Yorkdale store was confirmed on April 8, 2013,[77] and opened on October 21, 2016.[78] The Toronto Eaton Centre was the last of the six stores to be announced on January 15, 2014,[79] however, it was the fourth to open on September 18, 2016.[80]\n\nThe first Nordstrom Rack opened at Vaughan Mills on March 21, 2018; and then a second location in Deerfoot Meadows in Calgary and a flagship location at One Bloor in Toronto opened on May 3, 2018.[81] Nordstrom Rack opened three other additional stores in Fall 2018; one at Heartland Town Centre in Mississauga, one at Ottawa Trainyards, and finally one at South Edmonton Commons.\n\nOn March 2, 2023, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing all their Canadian stores, which would entail 2,500 staff losing their jobs. The company stated, \"Despite our best efforts, we do not see a realistic path to profitability for the Canadian business.\"[82] The closing would be done under court supervision within the framework of the Canadian Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA), with the help of a third-party liquidator.[83] Liquidation sales began for all locations on March 21, 2023. All Canadian Nordstrom Rack locations closed on May 14, 2023,[84] while all Canadian full-line stores closed on June 13, 2023.\n\nRetail formats\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of May 2022 , there are 100 full-line Nordstrom department stores,[85] which average 140,000 square feet (13,000 m2).[86]\n\nNordstrom holds six annual sales. Two of these are Half-Yearly sales, which take place semi-annually in May and late December, as well as three additional seasonal sales. Nordstrom's largest sale event is the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, which is held each July.[87] Limited amounts of merchandise set to be released for the following fall are sent to Nordstrom stores early, where they are sold at discount. For ten days prior to Anniversary Sale, Nordstrom gives early access to members who make appointments.[88]\n\nNordstrom Local\n\n[edit]\n\nNordstrom Local service hubs are oriented for amenities including online order pickup, personal styling, and tailoring. They do not have their own inventory, and instead source merchandise from full-line stores as needed. As of May 2022 , there are seven Nordstrom Local locations between New York City and Los Angeles,[85] which average 3,000 square feet (280 m2).[86]\n\nRestaurants\n\n[edit]\n\nFast casual and full-service restaurants operate within most Nordstrom full-line stores.[89]\n\nList of Nordstrom restaurants[90] Restaurant Concept type Year\n\ndebuted Notes Bar Verde 2013 Bistro Verde Bazille Broadway Bar Bar Located within New York City flagship store Burger Bar American 2022 Located within New York City flagship store Cafe Bistro Cafe Nordstrom Classic Cafe 1980 Rebranded as Marketplace Cafe in 1998 Ebar Coffeehouse Gelato Bar 2016 Located in Ala Moana Center store Habitant Bar 2013 Hani Pacific Hawaiian 2019 Previously located within New York City flagship store Jeannie's Pizza 2019 Marketplace Cafe Comfort food 1998 Rebranded from Classic Cafe Milk Bar Bakery 2019 Located in New York City men's store Nordstrom Grill American NYC Clubhouse Bar Located in New York City men's store Oh Mochi Mochi donuts Ruscello Mediterranean Shoe Bar Bar Sweet Sundae Bar Dessert Wolf Italian 2019 Located within New York City flagship store\n\nNordstrom Rack\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Nordstrom Rack\n\nNordstrom Rack originated as a bargain basement in the downtown Seattle flagship store in 1973.

      "# [Nordstrom family strikes deal to take company private by Beth Duckett, Brian Warmoth, Mary Meisenzahl, Bloomberg report, Abbas Haleem on 2024-12-27](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/12/27/nordstrom-family-strikes-deal-to-take-company-private/)\nNordstrom is returning to its roots as a private company. The founding family of the iconic department store chain, in partnership with Mexican retailer El Puerto de Liverpool, has finalized a $6.25 billion all-cash deal to acquire the company. Recently approved by Nordstrom’s board, the deal values shares at $24.25 each and includes existing debt.\n\nThe agreement marks the Nordstrom family’s second attempt to go private after a failed bid nearly seven years ago. For the retailer, the move offers more flexibility to pursue long-term growth strategies — including in ecommerce — without the pressure of quarterly financial reporting.\n\nNordstrom ranks No. 23 in Digital Commerce 360’s Top 1000 Database of the largest online retailers in North America, where it falls under the Apparel & Accessories category. The retailer operates the Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brands. Digital Commerce 360 projects Nordstom’s online sales will reach $5.28 billion in 2024.\n\nNordstrom web sales by year\n\nNordstrom family’s second attempt to take company private\n\nFounded in 1901 as a Seattle-based shoe store, Nordstrom went public in 1971. This is the second buyout attempt by the Nordstrom family, following a 2018 bid valued at $8.4 billion, which was rejected by the board.\n\nIn February 2024, Nordstrom’s board formed a special committee of independent directors after CEO Erik Nordstrom and president Peter Nordstrom expressed renewed interest in taking the company private. At the time, the family owned 33.4% of the company, while El Puerto de Liverpool held a 9.6% stake, acquired in 2022 for approximately $300 million.\n\nBy September 2024, the family and Liverpool proposed a $23-per-share buyout offer. After review, the board approved a revised offer of $24.25 per share — a 42% premium over the stock’s price on March 18, when reports of the buyout first emerged.\n\nErik and Peter Nordstrom recused themselves from the final vote, and the board unanimously approved the transaction.\n\n“Following a rigorous and independent evaluation and consultation with outside financial and legal advisors, the special committee unanimously concluded that this transaction offers greater value for all public shareholders at a significant premium to the unaffected share price,” said Eric Sprunk, who is chairman of the special committee and former COO of Nike, in a statement.\n\nNordstrom deal’s financing details\n\nUnder the agreement, the Nordstrom family will own 50.1% of the company, while Liverpool will hold 49.9%.\n\nThe deal will be financed through:\n\nA mix of equity contributions from the Nordstrom family and El Puerto de Liverpool\n\nCash commitments from Liverpool\n\nUp to $450 million in new borrowings under a $1.2 billion asset-backed loan\n\nCompany cash reserves\n\nNordstrom’s existing $2.7 billion in debt will remain in place after the transaction.\n\nAs part of the deal, Liverpool will gain a seat on Nordstrom’s board, giving the Mexican retailer more influence over strategic decisions. Liverpool ranks No. 30 in Digital Commerce 360’s Top 1000, with 2024 online sales projected to hit $3.89 billion.\n\nThe deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory approval.\n\nEcommerce and digital growth remain a focus\n\nThe deal comes as Nordstrom works to enhance its ecommerce business and drive digital growth.\n\nEarlier this year, the company announced a new online marketplace on Nordstrom.com and an enhanced search feature. The marketplace broadens its product selection, with more brands, sizes, and styles, while giving partners like Mulberry and Adore Me increased visibility.\n\nRecent sales performance paints a mixed picture. For the 2023 fiscal year ending Feb. 3, 2024, Nordstrom reported $14.22 billion in total sales, down from $15.08 billion in 2022. Online sales made up 36% of total Nordstrom sales for the year.\n\nHowever, the company showed growth across the first three quarters of fiscal 2024:\n\nQ1: Net sales rose 5.1% year over year for the quarter ended May 4.\n\nQ2: Net sales increased 4% to $3.79 billion, with digital sales accounting for 37% of revenue, up from 36% the previous year.\n\nQ3: Net sales climbed 4.6% to $3.3 billion for the quarter ended Nov. 2. Digital sales grew 6.4%, with online successes particularly visible at Nordstrom Rack, according to the retailer.\n\nNordstrom Rack continues to play a key role in the company’s growth. Rack launched the option for buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS) at more than 100 locations in Q3. Since the start of fiscal 2024, Nordstrom has opened 23 Nordstrom Rack stores and plans to open at least 15 more in 2025.\n\nDo you rank in our databases?\n\nSubmit your data and we’ll see where you fit in our next ranking update.\n\nSign up\n\nStay on top of the latest developments in the online retail industry.

      "# [Nordstroms succeed in taking company private for $6.25B by Daphne Howland on 2024-12-23](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstroms-puerto-liverpool-company-private-625b/736220/)\nErik, Pete and Jamie Nordstrom and other members of the founding family have succeeded in their effort to bring the retailer, established over a century ago by their forebear John W. Nordstrom, back under family control, in an all-cash transaction valued at about $6.25 billion.\n\nThe family group plus Mexican retail conglomerate El Puerto de Liverpool will acquire all the outstanding common shares they don’t already own. The transaction is financed through a combination of rollover equity by the Nordstrom family and Liverpool; cash commitments by Liverpool; up to $450 million in borrowings under a new $1.2 billion ABL bank financing; and the company’s cash on hand.\n\nDebt will be mostly unchanged: the $2.7 billion principal of existing senior notes and long-term debt will remain outstanding. As part of the transaction, Nordstrom expects to secure existing senior notes and debentures with a second lien on its current assets and related collateral and a first lien on other assets (excluding real estate), per the release.\n\nFollowing the closing, the Nordstrom family will be the majority owners of the company, and Liverpool will own 49.9%. Erik and Pete Nordstrom’s great-grandfather launched the business as a shoe store in Seattle in 1901.\n\nThe deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory and other conditions. It still needs the approval of two-thirds of the holders of Nordstrom’s common stock and of a majority of shareholders outside of the family, Liverpool, directors and other officers.\n\nThe company’s common stockholders will receive $24.25 per share in cash, a premium of some 42% to the closing price on March 18. Once the deal closes, the board also plans to authorize a special dividend of up to 25 cents per share.\n\nFour years ago, Erik Nordstrom took the reins as sole chief executive and Pete Nordstrom was named president and chief brand officer; Jamie Nordstrom is chief merchant as of last year. The department store’s board of directors (with Erik and Pete Nordstrom recusing themselves) unanimously approved the transaction, according to a company press release.\n\nIn September, the Nordstroms and Liverpool offered $3.8 billion to make this move, and a special committee of the board was established to mull the proposal. Their success in following through will allow them to “take a long term view of the business and make necessary investments and changes away from the short term scrutiny of public markets,” though it won’t cure all ills, GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said by email.\n\nThe department store is hardly the worst performer in its sector, but it hasn’t measured up to its own past standards in merchandising and operations, including store operations, according to Saunders.",
      "# [Nordstrom to close 2 Massachusetts locations by Thea DiGiammerino on 2025-01-07](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/nordstrom-massachusetts-closures/3595282/)\nNordstrom will close two Massachusetts locations in the coming months, a company spokesperson confirmed Tuesday.\n\nThe Northshore Mall Nordstrom store in Peabody and the South Shore Plaza Nordstrom store in Braintree will close as their leases expire, a company spokesperson said. The last day in Peabody will be January 31, 2025, and in Braintree, March 8, 2025.\n\n\"We believe we’ll be best able to serve customers in the area by leveraging our surrounding stores and through our digital channels. Decisions like this are never easy and we understand the impact they have on our team members. We’re committed to taking care of our employees through this transition, which includes supporting those that are interested in finding another role within Nordstrom,\" the spokesperson said in an email to NBC10 Boston.\n\nLori Sarofeen, who works in the cosmetics department in Peabody, said it’s disappointing news.\n\n“Didn’t expect to come to work hearing that. And it’s closing in like three weeks.”\n\nShe said it’s not that surprising, given that the nature of retail has changed over the years. She said she learned of the closure when she showed up at work Tuesday and does not yet know if she'll be able to relocate.\n\nElsa Zangari, who works in the beauty department, agreed, saying she believes more and more stores are closing as people shop online.\n\n\"Everyone's shopping online so they don't feel they have to come into the store,\" she said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many employees will be impacted by the closures, or how many will be able to relocate.\n\nSimon, which owns the mall properties, said the spaces will be filled by a DICK's House of Sport at the Northshore Mall and a DICK's Sporting Goods at the South Shore Plaza, scheduled to open in 2026.",

      "# [Nordstrom’s net earnings dips despite 4.6% Q3 FY24 net sales growth by Jangoulun Singsit on 2024-11-29](https://www.just-style.com/news/nordstrom-q3-fy24-earnings/)\nDespite this, Nordstrom experienced a 4.6% rise in net sales, reaching $3.35bn in the quarter ending 2 November 2024, up from $3.20bn in Q3 FY23.\n\nThe timing of Nordstrom’s Anniversary Sale impacted net sales negatively by approximately 100 basis points compared with the third quarter of the previous year, the retailer said.\n\nQ3 FY24 operating performance highlights:\n\nThe Nordstrom banner reported a modest 1.3% increase in net sales, while Nordstrom Rack experienced a more substantial 10.6% rise in Q3 FY24. Both banners achieved a comparable sales growth of 4% and 3.9%.\n\nIn the earnings call, chief executive officer, director Erik Nordstrom noted that Rack is experiencing significant growth from the addition of new stores, which have become the primary driver of customer acquisition.\n\nDigital sales continued to show strength with a 6.4% increase, representing 34% of total sales during the quarter.\n\nIn the third quarter, the company expanded its Marketplace operations, which now features more than 300 sellers providing a diverse range of products to our customers.\n\nCategories such as women’s apparel and active saw double-digit growth, with shoes, men’s apparel, and kids’ wear also performing well at high single-digits. The company saw improved sequential growth in women’s apparel, shoes, and men’s apparel.\n\nThe company’s gross profit margin improved slightly to 35.6%, up from 35% last year, primarily driven by strong regular price sales. However, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) decreased to $83m from $102m during the same period in fiscal 2023.\n\nIncreased selling, general and administrative expenses were noted, rising to 36.6% of net sales due to higher labour costs and charges related to accelerated technology depreciation.\n\nDespite these challenges, Nordstrom ended the quarter with $1.2bn in available liquidity, including $397m in cash.\n\nNordstrom president Pete Nordstrom said: “Our third quarter results demonstrate that our strategic focus on curating a compelling brand assortment is resonating with customers.\n\n“Our actions throughout this year have led to this moment, and we feel well-positioned for a successful holiday season and look forward to helping our customers celebrate the moments that matter. I’m grateful to our dedicated team for consistently delivering the high level of service our customers have come to expect from Nordstrom.”\n\nFull year 2024 outlook:\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, Nordstrom forecasts flat to 1% growth in revenue range and expects comparable sales to grow between 1% and 2% versus fiscal 2023. It projects EPS in the range of $1.40 to $1.70 and an EBIT margin between 3 to 3.4% of sales.\n\nTo date in fiscal 2024, the company has opened 23 stores, ending the quarter with a total of 381 stores.\n\nIn March this year, the founding family behind Nordstrom reportedly sought to take the US department store operator private, a move that comes as no surprise to an industry analyst who believes the store has lost its “retail mojo” after facing mounting pressure from investors.\n\nNordstrom banner net sales increased 1.3% over the quarter.

      "# [Nordstrom credits faster supply chain operations for improved CX by Bryan Wassel on 2024-08-28](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/news/nordstrom-backend-customer-experience-rfid-service-q2/725540/)\nThis audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.\n\nDive Brief:\n\nNordstrom credited CX improvements, including improved e-commerce search and more efficient supply chain operations, as major contributors to its 3.4% net sales growth, executives said on a Q2 2024 earnings callTuesday.\n\nMore efficient operations enable faster returns and ensure popular items are available when customers need them, according to executives. The effort includes using RFID tags on items at more stores to improve accuracy and speed of service.\n\n“Our efforts to improve the customer experience are taking hold, as evidenced by the strength of our top line,” Cathy Smith, CFO of Nordstrom, said during the earnings call. “In the second quarter, we grew our customer count, recorded an increase in customer trips and expanded margins.”\n\nDive Insight:\n\nSpeedier backend operations aid Nordstrom’s efforts to deliver solid CX, whether customers shop in-store or online.\n\nA faster supply chain helps ensure customers can always find what they want while reducing costs for the retailer, according to Erik Nordstrom, CEO of Nordstrom. The right inventory serves as a foundation for good experiences.\n\nRFID tags, electronic devices to track individual items, are an important part of this strategy. The technology helps track how quickly popular items are being sold, leading to better in-stock rates. RFID can also help associates quickly locate whatever product a customer wants, speeding up in-store experiences.\n\nThe RFID rollout improves warehouse operations as well, leading to faster e-commerce order delivery times in previous quarters.\n\nNordstrom began to overhaul its data and analytics capabilities in the second quarter, according to Smith. The retailer expects the effort to enhance its ability to use generative AI once the transformation is complete at the end of the year.\n\nNot all of Nordstrom’s CX efforts are focused on the backend. The company’s annual anniversary sale in July and August included 900 in-store events, up about 20% from the previous year, according to Peter Nordstrom, president and chief brand officer at Nordstrom.",

Founded in 1901 by John W. Nordstrom and Carl F. Wallin, the company initially operated as a shoe store before expanding into clothing in 1963 and becoming a full-line retailer by 1971. Nordstrom operates both full-line department stores and the off-price Nordstrom Rack division, which was established in 1973 [(Wikipedia, 2003-04-22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom).\n\nAs of May 2022, Nordstrom operates 100 full-line stores, averaging 140,000 square feet each, and 249 Nordstrom Rack locations [(Wikipedia, 2003-04-22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom).

The deal involves the Nordstrom family and Mexican retail group El Puerto de Liverpool, with the family retaining a 50.1% stake and Liverpool holding 49.9% [(Duckett et al., Digital Commerce 360, 2024-12-27)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/12/27/nordstrom-family-strikes-deal-to-take-company-private/). This acquisition is expected to provide Nordstrom with more flexibility to pursue long-term growth strategies, particularly in e-commerce, without the pressures of quarterly financial reporting [(Howland, Retail Dive, 2024-12-23)](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstroms-puerto-liverpool-company-private-625b/736220/).\n\n### Financial Performance\n\nFor the fiscal year ending February 3, 2024, Nordstrom reported total sales of $14.22 billion, a decrease from $15.08 billion in 2022. However, online sales accounted for 36% of total sales, indicating a growing reliance on digital channels [(Duckett et al., Digital Commerce 360, 2024-12-27)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/12/27/nordstrom-family-strikes-deal-to-take-company-private/). The company has shown growth in net sales across the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, with a notable 10.6% increase in sales at Nordstrom Rack [(Singsit, Just-Style, 2024-11-29)](https://www.just-style.com/news/nordstrom-q3-fy24-earnings/).\n\n## Product Overview\n\n### Nordstrom's Retail Formats\n\nNordstrom operates several retail formats, including:\n\n- **Full-Line Stores**: These stores offer a wide range of luxury apparel, accessories, and beauty products.\n- **Nordstrom Rack**: An off-price division that provides discounted merchandise.\n- **Nordstrom Local**: Smaller service hubs focused on online order pickups and personal styling, without carrying inventory [(Wikipedia, 2003-04-22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom).\n\n### Sales Events\n\nNordstrom is known for its annual sales events, particularly the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, which is a significant opportunity for customers to purchase luxury items at discounted prices. The sale typically features early access for members of the Nordy Club, which incentivizes customer loyalty [(Wikipedia, 2003-04-22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom).\n\n## Executive Leadership\n\nErik Nordstrom serves as the CEO, having taken the role in March 2020. He, along with his brother Pete Nordstrom, who is the President and Chief Brand Officer, has been instrumental in navigating the company through recent challenges and strategic shifts [(Howland, Retail Dive, 2024-12-23)](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstroms-puerto-liverpool-company-private-625b/736220/). Following the acquisition, the Nordstrom family will regain majority control, allowing them to focus on long-term strategies without public market pressures [(Duckett et al., Digital Commerce 360, 2024-12-27)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/12/27/nordstrom-family-strikes-deal-to-take-company-private/).\n\n## Partnerships and Innovations\n\nIn 2016, Nordstrom partnered with Tesla Motors to open retail galleries within select Nordstrom locations, showcasing a blend of luxury retail and automotive innovation [(Wikipedia, 2003-04-22)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom).

The decision to close two Massachusetts locations in early 2025 reflects a strategic shift to focus on more profitable stores and digital channels [(DiGiammerino, NBC Boston, 2025-01-07)](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/nordstrom-massachusetts-closures/3595282/). Analysts suggest that while the company is not the worst performer in its sector, it has struggled to meet its own past standards in merchandising and operations [(Howland, Retail Dive, 2024-12-23)](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstroms-puerto-liverpool-company-private-625b/736220/).\n\nIn conclusion, Nordstrom's recent acquisition and strategic focus on e-commerce and digital growth position the company for potential recovery and long-term success. However, the challenges of adapting to a rapidly changing retail environment will require continued innovation and strategic decision-making."
