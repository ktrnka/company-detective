  "summary_markdown": "# About Nordstrom\n\nNordstrom, Inc. is a prominent American luxury department store chain, originally founded in 1901 as a shoe store. Over the years, it has expanded its offerings to include a wide range of products such as clothing, accessories, and beauty products. The company operates more than 350 locations, including Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, and Nordstrom Local stores, and is headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Nordstrom has a significant online presence, ranking No. 21 on Digital Commerce 360’s Top 1000 list of the largest online retailers in North America, with projected online sales of $4.61 billion in 2024 [(Duckett et al., Bloomberg, 2024-09-10)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/09/10/nordstrom-family-makes-bid-to-take-retailer-private/).\n\nNordstrom primarily operates in the B2C market, targeting consumers looking for luxury and high-quality products. The company generates revenue through its physical retail locations and its online platform. In Q2 2024, Nordstrom reported net sales of $3.8 billion, with digital sales accounting for 37% of total revenue [(Duckett et al., Bloomberg, 2024-09-10)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/09/10/nordstrom-family-makes-bid-to-take-retailer-private/).\n\nThe company has evolved significantly over time, adapting to changes in consumer preferences and the retail landscape. It has focused on enhancing its digital capabilities and optimizing its supply chain to improve customer service and reduce costs [(Carranza, Retail Dive, 2024-09-09)](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstrom-cancels-west-coast-fulfillment-omnichannel-build-out/726193/).\n\nThird parties often describe Nordstrom as a resilient retailer facing challenges from off-price competitors and shifts in consumer behavior. The company is seen as having a strong brand but is also navigating structural challenges in the traditional department store segment [(DiPalma, Yahoo Finance, 2024-09-06)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nordstroms-current-take-private-offer-is-fair-pros-say-as-past-missteps-cost-its-chance-at-growth-202704181.html).\n\n# Key Personnel\n\n- **Erik Nordstrom**: CEO of Nordstrom, Inc.

This is their second attempt, following a failed bid in 2017. The proposal is under review by a special committee of independent directors [(Duckett et al., CBS News, 2024-09-04)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nordstrom-family-bid-department-store-private-3-76-billion-mexican-retail-group/).\n\n## Financial Performance\n\nIn Q2 2024, Nordstrom reported a 3.4% increase in net sales, reaching $3.8 billion.

Liverpool's resources and market presence are seen as strategic assets in this endeavor [(Duckett et al., Bloomberg, 2024-09-10)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/09/10/nordstrom-family-makes-bid-to-take-retailer-private/).\n\n# Additional Reading\n\n- [Nordstrom Product Page](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/-/5329142)\n- [Comprehensive Analyst Report on Nordstrom](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/09/10/nordstrom-family-makes-bid-to-take-retailer-private/)\n- [CBS News Article on Nordstrom's Going Private Proposal](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nordstrom-family-bid-department-store-private-3-76-billion-mexican-retail-group/)\n- [Retail Dive Article on Nordstrom's Supply Chain Optimization](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstrom-cancels-west-coast-fulfillment-omnichannel-build-out/726193/)\n- [Yahoo Finance Article on Nordstrom's Market Position](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nordstroms-current-take-private-offer-is-fair-pros-say-as-past-missteps-cost-its-chance-at-growth-202704181.html)\n\nThis report provides a detailed overview of Nordstrom's current state, key personnel, recent developments, and strategic initiatives.

Received them today and found on the first dress that one sleeve was altered in the front but the second was mistakenly altered in the back. On the second dress, I cannot determine whether any alteration was done since it is still so ill fitting. Called cust svc and my first call I was left on hold. Second call, a baby was screaming in the background and the rep put me on hold where I remained until I hung up. He eventually called back and told me I needed to call the store. Why not say that before putting me on hold? I sent an email to customer service and the written response is barely understandable, a bunch of mismatched words. I am disappointed and surprised by this downturn in customer service. This is not the business it used to be. I brought the dresses back to the store to be fixed by a second seamstress, who charged an additional $96 to properly tailor the dresses and fix the poor work done by the first person. After reaching out to the store manager about the additional charge, she had the tailoring manager call me. That person was the first seamstress. She insulted me and tried to body shame me. What a horrible experience. In the end, she said that “just this one time” she would ask that the store manager void the second charge. This was not a courtesy for me, it was a way to cover for her shoddy work. I’m done paying high prices for poor service. Farewell Nordstrom.",

As I purchased more items from the app over the course of the time I’ve been using it, some of the items were just a disappointment when I received them, other times the courier which Nordstrom uses to deliver my orders wouldn’t drop my packages outside my house (if I’m not home). But the main reason for my dissatisfaction is the issue of customer product review. I don’t know if Nordstrom is intentionally preventing me or thier other customers from writing product reviews for their orders but for some reason, I just can’t seem to leave a product review for most of the products I’ve received lately. I feel like Nordstrom has intentionally blocked me from writing a review after I left a poor review for a product I received a while ago. Since then I haven’t been able to write previews for my purchases which to me I find it extremely bad tactic by the company. People to be able to write and leave a product review that they’ve purchased so other potential buyers can get a sense of what they re about to spend their money on. This is such a coward tactics by Nordstrom. No wonder I never see reviews on many, many items I’ve come across on the app that should have a lot of reviews. SMH",

However I made an order today through the app which stated that it would be ready for pickup the same day. I needed to pick it up today as I’m leaving for a trip tomorrow and only placed the order so that I’d have the items for the trip.\n\nI waited for as long as I could but the order was “preparing for pickup” all evening. I showed up at the pick up desk with 10 minutes to close to see if I could get it. The customer service representative was on a personal call for about five minutes and then said it’s not ready and they’re closed. \n\nI don’t want to show up that late and make someone stay but hey - I was told it would be ready before close and I gave them as much time as possible to prepare the order. \n\nApart from the in person desk being rude to me for being there close to the end of their day, the online customer support was also unsympathetic. \n\nBasically, I did not get the service I was promised, wasted my time going to downtown Seattle, and will have to take extra time off work tomorrow (if I can) to pick up the order. \n\nVery disappointed and annoyed with the situation as I only made the purchase because I was under the assumption that I would be able to pick it up tonight. \n\nI hate to be one to complain about customer service workers. But as someone who has had many similar jobs, I know it’s not difficult to put in a little effort and at the very least be apologetic about a crummy situation.",

However, only one item in the order is going for pickup and one is being sent to my home. Why would I want to send half of an order to my home and half for pickup? It’s a flaw in the system i. my opinion. Apparently one needs to make the shipping selection one item at a time and it’s not clear when I’m shipping. The system should at least ask if I want to apply my chosen method to the entire order.

As long as I’ve had this app, which has been as long as they’ve had an app, every single time I sign in, including with face recognition, it always makes me answer the security questions, even though I always click the box to remember me. So it never remembers me, makes me answer security question EVERY time, and it’s super frustrating. It has honestly made me use the app less because I’m really just so fed up with having to do this. And yes, I have even deleted and reinstalled the app and it still makes you do the same thing. I’ve been told by multiple Nordstrom employees that I shouldn’t have to do this and that it was going to change several years back when they were redoing their application platform. Obviously, that is not the case. What good is having facial recognition and a “remember me” sign-in procedure when you have to answer a security question every single time?",

      "# What happened to customer service?, 1 stars [(Msgisnotforme, Apple App Store, 2024-07-13)](https://apple/11488595802)\nI left two dresses with a seamstress in the Peabody, Mass. location. Received them today and found on the first dress that one sleeve was altered in the front but the second was mistakenly altered in the back. On the second dress, I cannot determine whether any alteration was done since it is still so ill fitting. Called cust svc and my first call I was left on hold. Second call, a baby was screaming in the background and the rep put me on hold where I remained until I hung up. He eventually called back and told me I needed to call the store. Why not say that before putting me on hold? I sent an email to customer service and the written response is barely understandable, a bunch of mismatched words. I am disappointed and surprised by this downturn in customer service. This is not the business it used to be. I brought the dresses back to the store to be fixed by a second seamstress, who charged an additional $96 to properly tailor the dresses and fix the poor work done by the first person. After reaching out to the store manager about the additional charge, she had the tailoring manager call me. That person was the first seamstress. She insulted me and tried to body shame me. What a horrible experience. In the end, she said that “just this one time” she would ask that the store manager void the second charge. This was not a courtesy for me, it was a way to cover for her shoddy work. I’m done paying high prices for poor service. Farewell Nordstrom.",

      "# A great shoe experience at Nordstrom Park Meadows, 5 stars [(Sweet Pea Blossom, Apple App Store, 2024-07-11)](https://apple/11482485724)\nA most wonderful shoe salesman Charles waited on me today during the Anniversary Sale at Park Meadows Mall, he was very attentive and unboxed the shoes, and helped in discerning the correct fit.  Well, I bought all four pairs.  And he offered to set them aside after purchase, since it was the beginning of the day during the influencer party - so I did not have to make way to my car.  Finally in the afternoon, he offered to assist me and all my packages to my car.  I really appreciate Nordstrom for their quality salespeople all around especially Charles!  Thank you!",

Nordstrom has become elitist as opposed to a quality store.  Apparently unless you spend thousands of dollars a year you are not a valued customer.

As I purchased more items from the app over the course of the time I’ve been using it, some of the items were just a disappointment when I received them, other times the courier which Nordstrom uses to deliver my orders wouldn’t drop my packages outside my house (if I’m not home). But the main reason for my dissatisfaction is the issue of customer product review. I don’t know if Nordstrom is intentionally preventing me or thier other customers from writing product reviews for their orders but for some reason, I just can’t seem to leave a product review for most of the products I’ve received lately. I feel like Nordstrom has intentionally blocked me from writing a review after I left a poor review for a product I received a while ago. Since then I haven’t been able to write previews for my purchases which to me I find it extremely bad tactic by the company. People to be able to write and leave a product review that they’ve purchased so other potential buyers can get a sense of what they re about to spend their money on. This is such a coward tactics by Nordstrom. No wonder I never see reviews on many, many items I’ve come across on the app that should have a lot of reviews. SMH",

The customer service representative was on a personal call for about five minutes and then said it’s not ready and they’re closed. \n\nI don’t want to show up that late and make someone stay but hey - I was told it would be ready before close and I gave them as much time as possible to prepare the order. \n\nApart from the in person desk being rude to me for being there close to the end of their day, the online customer support was also unsympathetic. \n\nBasically, I did not get the service I was promised, wasted my time going to downtown Seattle, and will have to take extra time off work tomorrow (if I can) to pick up the order. \n\nVery disappointed and annoyed with the situation as I only made the purchase because I was under the assumption that I would be able to pick it up tonight. \n\nI hate to be one to complain about customer service workers.

However, only one item in the order is going for pickup and one is being sent to my home. Why would I want to send half of an order to my home and half for pickup? It’s a flaw in the system i. my opinion. Apparently one needs to make the shipping selection one item at a time and it’s not clear when I’m shipping.

Lots of bloggers and Insta - Influencers make a big deal about their Nordi semi-annual sale hauls. You can get some amazing deals if you find items you want at Nordstrom, add them to your wishlist on the app or website, or just keep them in your cart and then when the semi-annual sale comes the discounts will be automatically applied. Of course, it really pays to be a rewards member and/or a card holder because you get access to the semi-annual sale earlier than others. The rewards membership is free and all you have to do is enter your phone number anytime you shop to get \"notes\" and they're pretty easy to get and redeem. \n\nPlus, personal preference, but Nordstrom stores are just the nicest. The layout is consistent and its design team just does such a nice job of making sure the space is open, airy, classy, bright and comfortable. I also think Nordstrom has the best options for makeup and fragrance. It is the only one that carries Jo Malone outside of Sephora in the U.S. which is my favorite fragrance brand. \n\nNordstrom just makes the in-person shopping experience feel really nice. They offer a free personal shopping experience which I have never done but would love to do where you go in and you tell them your size and style and they will pull pieces and curate some looks for you and the only thing you pay is what you end up buying. Its those little services that make a difference in my book.\n\n### Comment ID gzghcrz with +6 score by [(loi_, Reddit, 2021-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/gzghcrz/) (in reply to ID gzfnmw0):\nThank you for this!

My old roommates father was a former C-Suite level officer of Nordstrom. While he was visiting the house one weekend Nordstrom had come up and he told a story of how when Nordstorm was expanding, they'd bought a tire store and turned it into a Nordstrom.\n\nA few weeks after opening, a man walked in the front door and rolled a tire over to the main desk. The man went on about how he'd bought the tire from the previous tenant, and could no longer return it because the tire shop no longer existed. \n\nManager asked how much the tires were. Popped open the register, handed him what must've been a couple hundred in cash, thanked him, and sent the man on his way. \n\nFrom that point forward, Nordstrom has forever had a tire item code in it's database.\n\n## Comment ID gzenvd0 with +83 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-05-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/gzenvd0/) (in reply to ID nkrqd6):\nNordstrom has the best return policy of these!

It really must depend on where you’re located. In my experience (though I’m definitely not a major fashion expert, I have lived and shopped in a few different cities) Bloomingdales is equivalent with Macy’s. Nordstrom is a lot better than both. Saks is definitely the most expensive and definitely does have some higher quality items, but you’re going to be paying for it.\n\nI like Nordstrom the best personally. Even if I was an independently wealthy millionaire, I’m pretty sure that I’d chose to shop with them. Their return policy rocks. If you have a card (maybe even if you don’t, I’m not sure) they give you credits for free alterations which can be really awesome if you find something that you love but doesn’t fit you just right. \n\nI’ve never bothered to do it, but you can call and give a general or specific list of things that you’re looking for (like vacation wear, casual stuff, something to wear to a friend or relatives wedding events, etc). A shopper will get a lot of stuff together and put it aside so that it’s ready for you to look over and try on when you show up. You don’t have to buy any of it either.\n\nWhen I’ve went in just to browse and tried something on, the salesperson always offered to bring me other things if what I had didn’t work. If I said no thanks and didn’t buy anything, they were still friendly and sweet. \n\nIdk, I’ve been to other places where I couldn’t walk for 5 minutes before someone new dying to sell me something would just pop out. I hated that, and haven’t experienced it at nordys. I sound like some kind of company ambassador 😂 🤣\n\n#### Comment ID gzgghig with +6 score by [(Gilmoregirlin, Reddit, 2021-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/gzgghig/) (in reply to ID gzg3dd5):\nI like Nordstrom because they hem things for free and I am short, so long as they are full price.

I've only been inside one true saks once, so i can't comment on that shopping experience, but i definitely prefer shopping at nordstrom over Bloomingdale's. And the nordstrom shoe store is the best out of the 3.\n\nHonestly, I'm at the point where if i need something, i typically check just nordstrom first to see what's available at what price points before i branch out to other stores. It just has everything, the returns policy is excellent, the bathrooms are better maintained and better lit, they do some alterations for you, and their in-store restaurant is better than Bloomingdale's.\n\n## Comment ID h2vikv7 with +2 score by [(vegaslivin26, Reddit, 2021-06-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/h2vikv7/) (in reply to ID nkrqd6):\nThey’re basically the same. Bloomingdale’s is Macy’s. It’s the same company. You’re paying for their overpriced Macy’s crap. Nordstrom you get their house brands which include actually decent merchandise that have been around for decades as well as the customer service that goes along with it. Neiman’s probably is considered the more exclusive department store in terms of brands carried, but Nordstrom actually does have the exact same depending on your location. Saks is equivalent to Neiman’s but with shorter in person hours & terrible service. I personally look at how many places have discount chain versions of their stores. They all do minus Neiman’s. That should help you if you want to rank by exclusivity.\n\n### Comment ID k471nnq with +2 score by [(Primary_Mirror_3504, Reddit, 2023-10-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/nkrqd6/difference_between_nordstrom_bloomingdales_and/k471nnq/) (in reply to ID h2vikv7):\nMacy's is in the middle as far as high-end to low-end.

I usually get Weekday and Dr. Denim jeans from there, the vanity sizing is minimal since they're not American brands.\n\n#### Comment ID f5mkzkh with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5mkzkh/) (in reply to ID f5lp3s8):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID f5oebr8 with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-10-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5oebr8/) (in reply to ID f5lp3s8):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID f5lpdzp with +2 score by [(todaystartsnow, Reddit, 2019-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5lpdzp/) (in reply to ID f5lp3s8):\nhave you looked at kohls? they are decent quality and have petite fittings as well.\n\n#### Comment ID f5mdlu9 with +3 score by [(ac0380, Reddit, 2019-10-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5mdlu9/) (in reply to ID f5lp3s8):\nHave you tried shopping in kids?

I’m pretty sure brands like Madewell and Topshop and Reformation don’t make clothes for NR specifically, so there’s a good chance those are the real quality. However, it’s kind of difficult to find garments from those brands that aren’t....kind of ugly. The reason they’re usually found at NR is because they were unpopular and didn’t sell.

It’s usually because they didn’t sell, but the good stuff I’ve found has been out of season. Like, I found a nice topshop sweater during summer. It’s really just a crapshoot.

I work for a fashion brand that's sold in Nordstrom and I can guarantee that anything you find at Rack from us is the real deal.  Building out an entirely different and cheaper manufacturing process just to sell at Rack at a lower cost wouldn't be economically practical for us.  \n\nUsually when I find things at Rack from our brand, it's from the past season, whereas what is found in Nordstrom's is the current season.  For example, we're a denim focused brand, so you'll currently find lots of washes from the summer in Rack right now, whereas Nordstroms is only selling from our fall/winter collection. \n\nI can only speak for my brand, but I imagine it is a similar situation for others as well.\n\n### Comment ID f5xhivq with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-10-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/do8kat/nordstrom_rack_questions/f5xhivq/) (in reply to ID f5xdpgm):\nThanks you for this information.

There is no Burberry made for Nordstrom Rack that will share the same label.

The quality is usually the same especially in denim. The only thing to be cautious of is the clearance items as they often do have defects like a weird cut or length. I really recommend trying everything on before purchasing. I also don’t recommend Madewell denim as it seems to not be of good quality from my own personal experience.

I got Birkenstocks for $18, some $20 Nikes, and a bunch of amazing exercise gear for $10 apiece. 40% off *everything* is really a ridiculous steal. It is an *incredible* sale, it’s just necessary to be super patient and maybe scope out the store to see how the employees seem to be faring / how crowded it is before going in?\n\n### Comment ID fvb7ha4 with +2 score by [(100139, Reddit, 2020-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/hbnjud/is_it_worth_checking_out_the_in_store_nordstrom/fvb7ha4/) (in reply to ID fv9x49j):\n>  how crowded it is before going in?\n\nWere they not limiting the number of people where you are? I went to 3 different stores here and they were counting the number of people in an out - at one I had to wait like 2 minutes till someone left before I could enter. So they were not at all crowded.\n\n### Comment ID fva2j4r with +1 score by [(schrutefarms-, Reddit, 2020-06-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/hbnjud/is_it_worth_checking_out_the_in_store_nordstrom/fva2j4r/) (in reply to ID fv9x49j):\nNice!

Everything is on clearance plus an optional 40% off. If you opt out of the 40% off things are refundable, if you chose to go for the extra 40% off, it’s final sale. The one downside is that fitting rooms are closed so you kind of have to know your size if you want to get the 40% off due to final sale. The first day I waited in line for about two hours. It sucked. I did end up going back the next day with my brother so he could buy some clothes, probably waited about an hour this time. I did see people that came in pairs would have one person wait in line while the other one looked around. I personally thought it was a really good sale. To give you an idea of the sales my mom got a lot of quality clothes, pots etc (21 items total) for $160!! My brother got really nice sunglasses that were valued at $100, dress shoes, several pairs of button down shirts, several sweatpants/athletic clothes from champion/nike, and Nike slides for about $180. I got Quay sunglasses for $14.\n\n## Comment ID fvau1gw with +4 score by [(Cheapthrills96, Reddit, 2020-06-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/hbnjud/is_it_worth_checking_out_the_in_store_nordstrom/fvau1gw/) (in reply to ID hbnjud):\nI went.

Like I got 2 Reformation dresses - $22 & $30, $12 Born booties that I have in another color, paid $130 for, Boss silk blouse $25, Vince silk blouse $30, Ted Baker WOC $30, CK suit $36, I can’t even remember what else. I got several things that I had also ordered recently - going to return those and keep the super cheap ones I got now!  Lots of brand name undies for $2-3, jewelry for under $5, Stocked up on the Neutrogena sunscreens I use as they were all like $3-4.

      "# Post ID h9y3ub: Nordstrom App tip and share your best shopping tips as well! with +252 score by [(quietisland, Reddit, 2020-06-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/h9y3ub/nordstrom_app_tip_and_share_your_best_shopping/)\nSince Nordstrom has been having a ton of really good sales - well kinda non-stop since March, just wanted to share some notes about the wish list features they have. Start by making a wishlist or two. I suggest making two wishlists, one for your actual regular shopping, and one that includes anything you want to track. Then in the app, turn on \"Notify me when an item goes on sale or comes back in stock.\"\n\nThen, Nordstrom sends you a notification when anything on your list(s) get reduced in price. And the 'back in stock' is a game changer during clearance time. When people cancel their orders, or stock was updated in a store and added back to inventory, you get a notification. I have picked up a few items I missed the first time thanks to this second one. \n\nNordstrom Rack as of now does not have this feature, but fingers crossed moving forward. \n\nI think shopbop is supposed to do the same with your hearts and lists, but I have only received emails about my cart from them, so I am not sure what the deal is. I do love how your hearts becomes a custom catalog though, so I am not complaining. :)\n\nDo you have any tips for shopping your fave store?

As the Sperry site only stocks specific (Mostly newer) styles.\n\nEdit: Newer Sperry skus start with 'STS' so you should be able to type that SKU number into the search feature on the site and find it.\n\n### Comment ID eyryu2y with +10 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/eyryu2y/) (in reply to ID eyrt7kf):\nThank you I'll have to try this\n\n## Comment ID eyrc4ch with +71 score by [(Dacyco, Reddit, 2019-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/eyrc4ch/) (in reply to ID cybu0w):\nIt is also possible that the shoes you bought at Nordstrom Rack are a much older model no longer sold in their website.\n\n### Comment ID eyrfpe8 with +14 score by [(meriendaselgato, Reddit, 2019-09-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/eyrfpe8/) (in reply to ID eyrc4ch):\nThat's my guess–  the style was made this season at a different factory and the ones she got were from a past season.

We'll get a like 20-min crash course on what to do. Find the return slip, look up the order, find the item being returned, credit the customer, throw it in a bag and send the item off to Inspections. \n\nWe are held to strict time standards and get less than 5 minutes to process each return. At that point, all we're looking for is the brand, size and color to match what was bought. So unless it's something glaringly obvious, like a different color, then any authenticity differences are not going to be noticed.\n\nThe next department (Inspections), checks to see how worn/damaged the item is, (but still isn't really trained much on signs of authenticity). \nAnd they get even less time @ literally 50 seconds per piece. \nThe running joke there is to just \"close your eyes and fold.\" \n\nOtherwise, actually inspecting the piece, lint rolling, cleaning, even buttoning it up, etc. takes up too much time. If you don't find a way to meet the time standards, eventually you'll lose your job. For most people, that way is to just not look too closely. \nI feel very bad about the quality they secondhand force us to send back out with the lousy time standards. I always say I don't hate the customer enough to work in Returns full time. \n\nAnyway, after inspecting, the piece is marked \"Good\" or \"Poor\". If it's \"Good\", it will go back to stock.\n\nIf it's \"Good\" but out of season, (since we accept returns from 100 years ago), it will then go to...boom, Nordstrom Rack. \n\nWe process tens of thousands of orders per day. I think the record right now is almost 40k in a day. \n\nSo, yeahhh totally possible. \n¯\\_(;--;)_/¯\n\n### Comment ID eysioy4 with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2019-09-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/eysioy4/) (in reply to ID eysh8ft):\nThank you for the insight!\n\n### Comment ID f24sjcy with +1 score by [(mitch8893, Reddit, 2019-10-01)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/cybu0w/does_nordstrom_rack_sell_fake_shoes/f24sjcy/) (in reply to ID eysh8ft):\nI am curious..

I understand that with covid the wait times will be longer. I see on Nordstrom racks Instagram pages that a lot of people are complaining about issues with their orders - missing items, items not shipping etc. I’m also seeing that some people commented about orders made last week that had shipped already which is making me wonder why my order which I placed weeks in advance is taking longer to ship that those who placed orders last week. \n\nIs anyone else experiencing shipping problems with Nordstrom rack?? I’m thinking it’s not worth It to go through all the hassle to contact customer service about my order.\n\nUPDATE: if they cancel your order they won’t tell you. If your order hasn’t shipped in 9 days - reach out to them via chat close to closing time (your wait time shouldn’t be longer than 20 minutes). They will not process a refund for you until you reach out to them inquiring about your order...\n\n## Comment ID frvb52q with +12 score by [(l0nelysadgirl, Reddit, 2020-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/gqwtvq/has_anyone_had_issues_with_nordstrom_rack/frvb52q/) (in reply to ID gqwtvq):\nThis happened to me too.

I ordered a pair of boots and the order went through, but was canceled a few days later with no explanation. I didn’t see the email telling me that the order was cancelled, so I called to find out what was taking so long. Initially, I called the Nordstrom customer service number number and the girl explained that I needed to call the Nordstrom Rack division to have them check my order. So she transferred me - to Colombia!! I couldn’t understand the customer service rep and had to ask her to repeat herself several times. I finally understood that my order had been canceled, even though they had charged my card and the order had gone through. They did issue a refund, but the whole experience was so frustrating - and unintelligible - I’ll think twice before ordering from them again. So much for the Nordstrom gold standard...:/.   If you’re having trouble getting a refund,  call the Nordstrom Rack customer service number. You’ll be connected to Colombia, but prob still worth the hassle to get your money back.\n\n## Comment ID frvbh9x with +2 score by [(sydsux, Reddit, 2020-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/gqwtvq/has_anyone_had_issues_with_nordstrom_rack/frvbh9x/) (in reply to ID gqwtvq):\nI ordered a pair shoes the middle of last month and they took about a week and a half to get to me.\n\n## Comment ID frvbs80 with +2 score by [(thr3lilbirds, Reddit, 2020-05-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/gqwtvq/has_anyone_had_issues_with_nordstrom_rack/frvbs80/) (in reply to ID gqwtvq):\nI ordered two dresses and one of them still isn't here.

Look people Elk Grove is a short sleeve and cut off pants (its a beach city environment, NOT a Los Angeles, or Wallstreet attire) and nobody cares about if your wearing Michael Kors crap.  I saw a tennis shoes that was BS regular price $225 and now it $95..really what a joke.  I rather buy my stuff \"online\" or Amazon, and that where people are heading. There reason Nordstrom has prices are so (high) is because stupid people will buy left over weird sizes and the Nordstrom Rack property taxes are high, so they have to pass the the buck to the consumers and consumers are not so smart as they appear. I spoke to a customer he told me that they walked out with a large bag and thats all he bought was 1 Michael Kors underwear and it was priced the same for 4 underwears at KOHL for 16 bucks really? He told me it was a joke and the reason he bought something is because he felt sorry for them that it will \"fold\" or \"go under\" sooner or later because of prices are too high.  I can go to the Sketcher outlet at Florin Road and they have a sale. Buy on regular shoe for 80 bucks and get the 2nd 50% off what a deal. The place is a huge disappointment. Why oh why did they build this crap store with 50 people working when they are going to lay off 25 of them anyway, when it gets slow..\"so what the hype?\"  Retail is \"not\" where its at these when you cant beat out Amazon or online pay now or pay later stores. Nobody cares about \"brand names\" clothes or shoes, because everything is going to wear and tear.  Elk Grove, should start thinking of building IBM, HP, Intel, Sony, Samsung or Panasonic coorperation in Elk Grove, cause if you keep building retail crap then people are going to leave and sell their homes and move elsewhere because there are NOT good paying jobs here, its going to be a ghost town, like the mall in Fresno.  Elk Grove, get your crap together and get cooperations here otherwise your going to see a ghost town looking like Mack Road or Florin Road.  Nobody is getting in their car to show when you have Amazon that is taking over the market they own that market already.retail boxes stores dont.  The Nordstrom Rack is a complete mess.  People are too \"gullible\" and easy to be persuade to buy anything. Olive Garden used to be packed and its been opened for 2 years and now its has 8-10 cars because its NOT really healthy.  People are looking for bargain and less expensive to eat.  California is going to be more expensie when the minimum wage will put on the ballot for $18 an hour in the fall 2024.  Now its $20 hour for fast food.  So, get with it Elk Grove and nobody is getting in their cars when you have gas that cost 5.50 a gallon.  People are staying in and cooking at home and shopping online....time has changed...it look like Marshall and TJ Maxx (Macy's clothes)..bunch of Hand-me-down clothes that are used by some one else.  So, tell me and answering my question Nordstom Rack - now with that being said, \"why are you here?\" Macy's is here next to Target in Elk Grove, Ca and its more spacious and nice..I call it Mini Macy's, but its cool...sorry Nordstrom Rack you have competition and their prices are reasonable..you lost Nordstrom Rack..The problem with managment in every company is that they hire lazy people and this is what you get as results...clothese all over floor and thrown clothes everywhere.  Management dont have a clue or distinction between good employees and bad employees and they hire too much high schoolers who dont care because they have other career to think of and its surely not working or retail.  I want to \"burst\" the bubble to \"all\" management why dont you hire \"retirees\" that want to work and want to make extra money and not student cause they are so damn lazy.  As results, you get shoes and clothese everywhere...otherwise i dont feel sorry Nordstrom for bad reviews...People check Macy's on Laguna they want to work they \"hire\" alot of \"retirees\" and they keep their store very very clean...head on down there and see for yourself.\n\n## Comment ID l6qn978 with +1 score by [(Puzzleheaded-Bank-64, Reddit, 2024-06-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElkGrove/comments/1d4jp6f/elk_groves_new_nordstrom_rack_store_opens_with/l6qn978/) (in reply to ID 1d4jp6f):\nMust be nice to have absolutely nothing going on in your life that you find standing in line to get into a Nordstrom rack an appropriate utilization of time.",
      "# Post ID i7wd1s: I assumed being sold at Nordstrom meant a brand was a high-quality, luxury brand. Turns out Nordstrom.com is just a marketplace (like Amazon or Walmart.com) where anybody can sell. with +102 score by [(e925, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/)\n**Edit: Ok not ANYBODY who wants to sell there can sell there. But they aren’t as choosy and bougie as one might think. The takeaway is this: If you, like me, equate the name “Nordstrom” with high-quality, luxury brands (like Nordstrom used to carry exclusively), that is no longer the case.** \n\n**Because something has been sold at Nordstrom Rack (like Byroe), it does not mean it was once sold at Nordstrom and just went on clearance. Just because something is sold at Nordstrom (or Nordstrom Rack), it no longer should imply quality or luxury, like my poor-person brain thought it still did. Oh, and don’t pick the Byroe serum. The ingredients are terrible.**\n\nI recently saw a post about how Grace & Stella (an admitted private label company) is now selling their products at Nordstrom. \n\nThis made me remember the times that I’ve questioned a brand’s legitimacy, only to be reassured of their quality when I saw the products were available to purchase at Nordstrom (a luxury retailer).\n\nI once saw somebody comment that the Byroe toner was Boxycharm including a product with an artificially inflated price point, and I defended them by saying, “This is not the same as the $90 brush set situation. They sell Byroe at Nordstrom. $90 is the actual price.”\n\n~~I alsowondered why I had never heard of Malin + Goetz before seeing them in beauty boxes, but when I looked them up, I saw that they were for sale at Nordstrom.com. This led me to believe that Malin + Goetz is a prestige brand.~~\n\nBut when it was brought to my attention that Grace & Stella was being sold at Nordstrom.com, I was like whaaa...? \n\nI know for a fact that Grace & Stella is not a luxury brand. I’m not saying that all private labeling is bad - but when I think of a product being sold at Nordstrom, I assume it’s on par with Jo Malone, Khiel’s, Dior, etc., which I know Grace & Stella is *not*. \n\nSo I did some research, and it turns out [anybody can sell](https://www.acenda.com/content/sell-on-nordstrom) at Nordstrom.com. That’s why I couldn’t find Byroe ~~or Malin + Goetz~~ for sale anywhere else.\n\nJust a PSA, in case anybody else was still looking at Nordstrom as a luxury retailer, aka from a 1990s point of view.\n\nEdit: ok so I was wrong about Malin + Goetz (it shows up at other retailers if you search for that retailer specifically), but I’m doubling down on Byroe. Take today’s Boxycharm choice of [Tomato Serum](https://byroe.com/products/tomato-serum).  The first four ingredients are cheap moisturizers and fillers, and the 5th ingredient is alcohol. Tomato extract is the 47th out of 48 ingredients. With an RV of $150/Oz.\n\n## Comment ID g14hf56 with +56 score by [(luckycat03, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14hf56/) (in reply to ID i7wd1s):\nI agree with your comments about Byroe and especially Grace & Stella but imo Malin + Goetz is a reputable albeit overpriced brand.

Former Nordstrom corporate employee here. This isn't exactly true. Nordstrom doesn't let just anyone sell products like Amazon or Walmart.  Nordstrom does have a drop ship program, but a vendor still has to pass through a process and a buyer has to want the merchandise. [This list that was referenced](https://www.nordstrom.com/browse/nordstrom-cares/partnership-guidelines) is customer facing, it is definitely not all of the requirements for becoming a drop ship partner. This is a broad overview for curious people. They are not going to state \"you must be a luxury brand\" explicitly on a customer facing page, they are more about creating the \"atmosphere\" of luxury or if they state that a brand is luxury it's usually with a euphemism or about how something feels. I know that their image is what is keeping them afloat in this brutal retail world so I don't think they would throw that away to become an online marketplace.\n\nThey are probably selling Grace and Stella because, as someone else mentioned, they are hype right now, and Nordstrom wanted to cash in on that. Grace and Stella's marketing team is much smarter than face skin's; they have a much better image. I agree that this was a miss for them, and I doubt they would have agreed to the partnership if they knew they were alibaba crap. Nordstrom sold Goop gemstones for like $80 that were \"blessed\" by someone named Heather. They want to jump on trends.\n\n### Comment ID g15i8sa with +5 score by [(pounce_the_panther, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g15i8sa/) (in reply to ID g14xn25):\nAll of the Grace and Stella items I can find are in the Pop Up shop.

Thanks for taking the time to give your input. \n\nI guess my point was this - I was excited for the Byroe toner because I saw it at Nordstrom Rack. \n\nI thought all products at Nordstrom Rack were products that were once sold at Nordstrom and had gone on clearance, so I used the fact that the Byroe toner was on clearance “for $29.97 from $95” [at Nordstrom Rack](https://www.nordstromrack.com/shop/product/3115305/byroe-bitter-green-essence-toner?color=GREEN) as clear evidence that Byroe is a legitimate luxury brand, and the Byroe toner was once sold at Nordstrom proper for $95. \n\nI’m probably not the only person here who thought the Nordstrom name was equivalent to a legitimate product. \n\nIt says 86% off, which gives the impression to me, an un-savvy shopper, that Nordstrom buyers think the Byroe toner is worth $95, because Nordstrom at one point “carried it.” \n\nDoes that make sense? I used the Nordstrom name as evidence of Byroe’s legitimacy when in conversation with others, but I now realize that that was not a valid argument. \n\nThe Byroe Tomato serum is a choice for a Boxy Premium today (and the ingredients are not worth $150), so I still think the post is important, just in case a fellow un-savvy shopper mistakenly assumed that Byroe = Nordstrom = Quality, when it does not mean that in the same way that it used to.\n\n#### Comment ID g15t78k with +15 score by [(Ditovontease, Reddit, 2020-08-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g15t78k/) (in reply to ID g15cll9):\nNever assume Rack is the same as Nordstrom. It's well known that TJ Maxx and other \"outlet\" type places will stock items from prestige brands but often those items were made SPECIFICALLY to go to TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack and are made far more cheaply than items that are carried at actual Nordstrom.

Malin + Goetz is definitely a legit brand, they are sold at a lot of the major retailers for years. They also have been supplying products to a lot of luxury hotels etc. so it fits that top tier status, in my opinion. It might not be a brand targeted to a young demographic so I don't think they do a lot of social media marketing. You can find them on Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, Sephora, Saks Fifth, their own boutiques and other retailers too. \n2. IDK about Byroe, since I am not interested in their products and haven't come across them.\n3. Grace & Stella is a brand, a millenial/gen-z/IG hyped up brand, that is. I haven't done my research but I would assume Nordstrom sells them because of their following, their \"aesthetic\" and their clout. LOL. So people who are interested in the brand would drive traffic to Nordstrom and perhaps buy other products from Nordstrom too, which gives them more money. Grace & Stella is a brand disguising as a luxury brand... They have good marketers and brand relationship managers to be honest, being able to get this far. Props to them.\n4. To your point, yes you are correct Grace & Stella is not a luxury brand when you compare it to Chanel, Dior and other brands being sold at Nordstrom. However, I also don't think Nordstrom = Walmart, Amazon where it's a free for all marketplace. I'm sure the brands go through an approval process where both parties benefit from the exposure and sales they get from Nordstrom. That's why there is no Wet & Wild or LA Girl there. Grace & Stella sells their stuff on a higher price point than drugstore and are aligning themselves to the likes of Saturday Skin, Youth to the People, Herbivore and other cutesy packaging, millenial reaching skincare brands *hence maybe why* you also see them at Nordstrom.\n\n### Comment ID g14nvrt with +19 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14nvrt/) (in reply to ID g14lg38):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID g14qpad with +13 score by [(biancae1izabeth, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14qpad/) (in reply to ID g14nvrt):\nYeah I'm with you!

Anyone who has had their images stolen by Alibaba and wish sellers knows that the product you're getting is RARELY the same thing as is shown in the picture. The picture is almost always a higher quality item that the cheap wholesale seller is duping. If you want to find instances of this, just take a look at simplynailogical's 500 videos about stolen content on wish - it is a huge problem especially for smaller brands and unknown creators to have their content stolen by online retailers because they have very little excess cash and legal backing to get them taken down. \n\n2 the items that YOU buy off alibaba, even if it seems to be the exact same product as something else, are rarely the same product a private labeler is buying. Private label companies don't log into alibaba and buy a bulk inventory and then repackage the goods. They contact a factory to have items specifically made for their order, often already with their private label on them or entirely unlabeled so that the company can brand them themselves and repackage in higher quality packaging. You can see this with practically all the hair accessories you can buy at any major retailer across the US. It is the same stuff with a different name on it. Theres only so many ways to make a Bobby pin! Private labelers dont automatically have bad quality just because they private label, they're just rebranding existing products and sometimes that product is crap and sometimes it isnt. A huge, well known private labeling company you all know and love is Trader Joe's. The majority of their products are existing products made by other brands relabeled for trader Joe's, sometimes with slight variations just so the trader Joe's one has a different ingredient list. Sometimes they just change the names on the ingredients even so you cant find their dupes, like using the chemical name for banana extract instead of just saying \"banana extract\". There is a big difference between you buying skincare from wish and the brand buying their original unlabeled product, #1 being when they import things to the US under their new private label, their stock is all going to be identical, whereas if you buy two of the exact same items off wish you could end up with two totally different products. Thats because Even private labelers have quality control. I think there is a lot of confusion about this especially on this app because of the one major private label scandal we all know that came up and now everyone thinks all private labelers are trying to poison us, but one of the reasons that story got so big is because they weren't just private labeling, they were doing it very badly and not doing proper quality control, which was the only reason anyone even knew they were a private labeler. Had they done a great job, you probably never would have known. Other private labelers will do everything they can not to make the same mistakes, because they dont want a scandal to marr their brands. Dls probably spends more trying to dig out of the pit from their scandal than they do on any other marketing by creating new brands all the time. They Have to make new brands to survive. No other brand wants to be in the same shoes as dls.\n\n3 almost all products' retail value are roughly 10% material cost, 10% packaging, 20% marketing, and 60% profit margin. The marketing they do isnt always to consumers. They also have to market to retailers to get them to carry their products\n\n4 luxury brands produce products in china too. Everyone does. Huge workforce, low labor and infrastructure costs. It just makes sense if you want to drive your costs down as much as possible. If they're not producing out of china it is from Indonesia, Thailand, anywhere they can drive the wages into the dirt. Some (not all!!! But some!!) Comments about chinese produced goods are borderline xenophobic without really considering that it isnt China, but the US that creates the horrible factory conditions and encourages costs to be cut as low as possible. Chinese factories have to compete with eachother for US brands to pick them, they're not just jerks trying to screw over one another. They're responding to the market factors created by US industry\n\nSorry I just kinda went off a bit but every time I see posts saying \"tHis bRAnD is alIBabA TrASh\" I go into angry-supply-chain-explanation-mode and my eyes turn red. \n\nAlso, why do people think Nordstrom is luxury? It seems just like any department store to me, is there some sort of department store hierarchy I dont know about? Where is Von Marr on the hierarchy? Because they're my favorite. They have nursing rooms with rocking chairs so I think they're the coolest\n\nAlso also, I too loved to swipe the malin and goetz from the hotel when leaving. Them and Crabtree & Evelyn are the two I like to keep\n\n### Comment ID g14nbqc with +21 score by [(grnidgurl, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14nbqc/) (in reply to ID g14lg38):\nGrace & Stella is just a notch above DLS (Dirthy Little Secrets).

They are usually around $20 retail I think at full-price. They \\*are\\* cheap looking dresses, but they aren't pretending at luxury here. These are items on super clearance at Nordstom's discount outlet, they probably just want them out the door. Since the clothes are manufactured by Nordstrom, they can either sell NPG items at a higher markup (which you can find in full price stores, with better materials) or at a lower price (at rack). Nordstrom tries to be pretty careful with their overseas manufacturers, but they are still overseas manufacturers. They are probably still turning a low profit on these dresses or selling them at cost (I have seen clearances lose money because I have seen markups, but this is probably not that). So there is something to be said about the ethics of a profitable $5 dress, but probably for a different subreddit.\n\n## Comment ID g14kxv9 with +5 score by [(radbu107, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14kxv9/) (in reply to ID i7wd1s):\nTo add to this, what do you guys think about Oryza eyeshadow that is offered through Ipsy? I am very skeptical because I have never heard of them, they are not sold anywhere (except their own site), and the packaging is very cheap. I found some eyeshadow [palettes ](https://imgur.com/a/tXlMfoJ) on Aliexpress which don’t have the exact same shades, but look very similar. They are $2.15 on Aliexpress and Oryza is trying to sell them for $19.95.\n\n### Comment ID g14n6ik with +5 score by [(PhillipeThePenguin, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14n6ik/) (in reply to ID g14kxv9):\n>palettes \n\nThese palettes are 3CE (Popular Korean Brand) dupes/knock offs(?)!

To us, it's \"you're gonna get such a good deal!\" whereas to brands it's \"you're going to get so many loyal customers by selling at an initial discount!\"\n\nIt's optional to believe this part of my post here as I can't back up in-person experiences with receipts, but: I actually met with a small brand founder whose products had been featured in a beauty box. This founder told me that they got a LOT of reviews from this move but not a lot of sales. Which...I could have guessed that part. But said founder was truly surprised by this.\n\nOf course you all know that we sub to boxes for deals, not for loyalty per say (or I'm speaking personally lol, I'll switch brands based on better prices!) \n\nNow with Byroe, my experience is more limited - but from my interactions, I'd say they really are aiming for a luxury brand (it's not Alibaba repackaged). Are their prices absurd? I mean...what luxury brand isn't? La Mer? ReVive? The price tags are goofy to me as someone who uses The Ordinary. But it's still in line with other luxury, and the experience is definitely in line with those brands as well.\n\nSo tbh I was surprised to see Byroe in Boxy but I've got two possible conclusions: either they hope to gain more popularity or they're selling their products at a markdown to maintain freshness (which is actually great, the brand is pretty young).\n\n## Comment ID g14g4sv with +2 score by [(e925, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14g4sv/) (in reply to ID i7wd1s):\nNo pun intended with the Point of View comment 😂\n\n## Comment ID g14m7lx with +1 score by [(MariposaSunrise, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14m7lx/) (in reply to ID i7wd1s):\nI usually use Sephora as my test to see if it is a high quality luxury brand.\n\n### Comment ID g14q21y with +8 score by [(e925, Reddit, 2020-08-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyBoxes/comments/i7wd1s/i_assumed_being_sold_at_nordstrom_meant_a_brand/g14q21y/) (in reply to ID g14m7lx):\nFor sure - there are a lot of good brands at Ulta too!

But you found some clothing products same as at Marshall's and Nordstrom. It could be as they are bought from overstock and sold them. And you will be surprised that both TJ Maxx and Marshall's are runned by same companies that is  TJX Companies.

Speaking of managers, I've had some great, amazing, supportive, genuinely kind-hearted human souls - the type that made me very happy, grateful, and proud to work at Nordstrom. There was never a moment of dragging my feet on Mondays with them. \n\nThen.. I had the unfortunate experience of working with one who was just... not great. They needed a lot to work on, from people skills to micro-management, they had several other red flags screaming toxic management. Yet, leadership unfortunately seems to like these types of individuals and so they stay; thereby, promoting a pretty insidious culture. Because of that, I feel Nordstrom leadership has lost its way...and lost trust with many employees. \n\nI accept that company culture changes all the time, and since the world is still healing from the pandemic, it's just a rough time for everyone right now. It's just a shame that Nordstrom isn't what it used to be.",

Because of the store’s generous return policy, the customers abuse the system which in turns affects sales person commission and take home pay. Hardworking employees are penalized and made to take on responsibilities of other employees who skimmed through work. Many managers are not a presence on the floor and most of the time if a sales person require assistance from manager, they could hardly be located and messages ignored.",

Instead of dealing with it, they viewed me as the problem and terminated me.)\n\nAdditionally, I want to add what they did to someone I worked with in 2018. A woman one of the managers did not like had their security team detain her, handcuff her, and interrogate her for hours in an attempt to confess to stealing $10k worth of merchandise. They claimed they had proof and would not share it with her. Nordstrom had her escorted off the premises by a police officer who then gave her an attorney's card and told her, \"this happens all the time. After a big sale they will use the loss of money to pin it on a worker they do not like.\" After a few weeks she received a letter in the mail stating that they actually were not going to pursue a court case even though they had said they were going to originally. But they said her position was still terminated. Nordstrom is one of the most crooked companies you will ever work for, and I suggest avoiding at all cost.\n&gt; Expected to have a fully open schedule and eat, breathe, live as if work is your entire life (no real work/life balance)",

You suck up to the managers you'll go far. Call out issues and work avoidance and you'll be micromanaged to heck and made to look like you're not performing well.\n\nHealth plans are TERRIBLE they only offer EPO and PPO's. No HMO unless you're in a certain state. So you have to pay for EVERYTHING until the deductible is met, then the plan will start paying 80 or 70% of your healthcare costs. Working here put me in a ton of medical debt because I am disabled. Nordstrom touts how they \"promote from within\" but once you hit the Customer Care Lead team, you'll be stuck there forever. My colleague and I in the Quality Assurance Department pointed out a ton of work avoidance amongst the team. Instead of fixing it and firing the people taking advantage of the company, they demoted the whole team to Customer Care Lead and said Quality can one day be done by AI.",

If you’re updating items or find discrepancies or finish a project, or were unable to finish a project, your stopping points are helpful to communicate to the department manager so they know what has and hasn’t gotten done yet. Or communicating your work or important issues to your direct manager, for the, to communicate that to the department managers.\n\nDepartment Managers themselves really appreciate when you communicate to them any updates or discrepancies they should be aware of.\n\nIt’s great fun when you’re there long enough to be familiar with everyone that work there. And Nordstrom can look good having on your resume.\n\nThe Pros were:\nA good decent pay, maybe around $19.50-20hr.\nGood health insurance, as long as you’re working 32hrs a week. I had Kaiser Permanente.\nThey have a matching 401k plan.\nDiscount applied to clothes and cafe restaurant and ebar.\n\nDuring Covid-19 in 2020 when a lot of us weren’t allowed to come back to work, they continued to pay for our health insurance for maybe 4-5 months. That was really nice of them.\nNordstrom also really tries to be better than other companies with offering a high pay rate for hourly workers.",

Instead of dealing with it, they viewed me as the problem and terminated me.)\n\nAdditionally, I want to add what they did to someone I worked with in 2018. A woman one of the managers did not like had their security team detain her, handcuff her, and interrogate her for hours in an attempt to confess to stealing $10k worth of merchandise. They claimed they had proof and would not share it with her. Nordstrom had her escorted off the premises by a police officer who then gave her an attorney's card and told her, \"this happens all the time. After a big sale they will use the loss of money to pin it on a worker they do not like.\" After a few weeks she received a letter in the mail stating that they actually were not going to pursue a court case even though they had said they were going to originally. But they said her position was still terminated. Nordstrom is one of the most crooked companies you will ever work for, and I suggest avoiding at all cost.\n&gt; Expected to have a fully open schedule and eat, breathe, live as if work is your entire life (no real work/life balance)",

If you’re updating items or find discrepancies or finish a project, or were unable to finish a project, your stopping points are helpful to communicate to the department manager so they know what has and hasn’t gotten done yet. Or communicating your work or important issues to your direct manager, for the, to communicate that to the department managers.\n\nDepartment Managers themselves really appreciate when you communicate to them any updates or discrepancies they should be aware of.\n\nIt’s great fun when you’re there long enough to be familiar with everyone that work there. And Nordstrom can look good having on your resume.\n\nThe Pros were:\nA good decent pay, maybe around $19.50-20hr.\nGood health insurance, as long as you’re working 32hrs a week. I had Kaiser Permanente.\nThey have a matching 401k plan.\nDiscount applied to clothes and cafe restaurant and ebar.\n\nDuring Covid-19 in 2020 when a lot of us weren’t allowed to come back to work, they continued to pay for our health insurance for maybe 4-5 months.

I was told I wasn't \"Here to Win\" for them because I sometimes took 5 minutes of personal time to grab my kid an extra snack if she was hungry.\n\nYou have to bid for your shift every 6 months and you're held to statistics that are not shared with you, just kept behind the scenes so you never know if you're improving or not.\n\nFavortisim rules in Nordstrom. You suck up to the managers you'll go far. Call out issues and work avoidance and you'll be micromanaged to heck and made to look like you're not performing well.\n\nHealth plans are TERRIBLE they only offer EPO and PPO's. No HMO unless you're in a certain state. So you have to pay for EVERYTHING until the deductible is met, then the plan will start paying 80 or 70% of your healthcare costs. Working here put me in a ton of medical debt because I am disabled. Nordstrom touts how they \"promote from within\" but once you hit the Customer Care Lead team, you'll be stuck there forever. My colleague and I in the Quality Assurance Department pointed out a ton of work avoidance amongst the team. Instead of fixing it and firing the people taking advantage of the company, they demoted the whole team to Customer Care Lead and said Quality can one day be done by AI.",

      "# [Nordstrom family makes $3.76 billion bid to take retailer private by Beth Duckett, Mary Meisenzahl, Bloomberg report, Fareeha Ali, Abbas Haleem on 2024-09-10](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/09/10/nordstrom-family-makes-bid-to-take-retailer-private/)\nNordstrom Inc.’s founding family has submitted a $3.76 billion proposal to take the department store chain private.\n\nLed by Erik Nordstrom, Nordstom’s CEO, and Peter Nordstrom, the company’s president, the family has partnered with Mexico-based retailer El Puerto de Liverpool, offering $23 per share in cash for the remaining shares the parties do not already own. This is the family’s second attempt in six years to gain full control of the retailer.\n\nA special committee of Nordstrom’s board, formed earlier this year after the family first expressed interest in a potential takeover, is now reviewing the proposal.\n\nNordstrom ranks No. 21 on Digital Commerce 360’s Top 1000 list of the largest online retailers in North America, where it falls under the Apparel & Accessories category. Digital Commerce 360 projects that Nordstom’s online sales will reach $4.61 billion in 2024.\n\nNordstrom web sales by year\n\nNordstrom’s proposal under review\n\nReuters first reported in March that the founding family was exploring plans to take the 123-year-old company private.\n\nOn Sept. 4, the special committee — made up of independent and disinterested directors of Nordstrom’s board — confirmed it had received a proposal. The committee’s next step is to consult with outside financial and legal advisers to evaluate whether the offer is “in the best interests of Nordstrom and all shareholders.”\n\nMembers of the Nordstrom family collectively own 33.4% of the company, while Mexico-based El Puerto de Liverpool, which operates more than 300 stores and an ecommerce platform, holds a 9.6% stake it acquired in 2022 for approximately $300 million.\n\nEl Puerto de Liverpool ranks No. 30 in the Top 1000. Digital Commerce 360 projects that its online sales will reach $3.89 billion in 2024.\n\nEl Puerto de Liverpool web sales by year\n\nIf approved, the deal would increase the Nordstrom family’s ownership to 50.1%, with Liverpool holding the remaining shares. The transaction would be financed through a mix of rollover equity and cash commitments by the Nordstrom family and Liverpool, along with $250 million in new bank financing, according to a company news release. Existing debt would remain in place.\n\nA second bid, following a failed 2017 offer\n\nThe $23-per-share bid represents only a nominal premium over Nordstrom’s $22 closing stock price on Monday. However, it falls significantly short of the $50-per-share offer made by the family in 2017. That offer valued the company at $8.4 billion. In 2018, the special committee rejected that offer as insufficient, and talks ultimately broke down when both sides failed to reach an agreement on price.\n\nWhile Nordstrom’s takeover effort is family-driven, Macy’s Inc. recently ended similar talks with investor group Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management after seven months of negotiations, citing the lack of a “compelling” offer with secured financing. Macy’s ranks No. 16 in the Top 1000.\n\nNeil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, explained that Macy’s prospective buyers were seeking short-term profits by monetizing assets, which may have weakened the company. In contrast, the Nordstrom family aims to take the company private to focus on a long-term strategy, free from the pressures of public markets.\n\n“This makes some sense and, despite recent issues at Nordstrom, will probably strengthen the retailer,” Saunders wrote in a LinkedIn post earlier this year.\n\nSales stabilizing\n\nNordstrom, like many other department stores, has faced declining traffic in recent years. However, Saunders noted in a separate post that the company’s sales have stabilized. For example, Nordstrom’s Q2 2024 sales were down just 0.6% compared to Q2 2019, while Macy’s and Kohl’s reported larger declines of 11% and 15.4%, respectively.\n\nIn Q2 2024, Nordstrom reported a 3.4% increase in net sales, reaching $3.8 billion. Nordstrom digital sales accounted for 37% of total revenue, up from 36% the previous year. CEO Erik Nordstrom highlighted that digital sales saw continued momentum, with a 6% rise in net sales.\n\nThe company’s Nordstrom Rack stores have also become a key strength, with sales jumping 8.8% in the most recent quarter, and comparable sales rising 4.1%.\n\nDo you rank in our databases?\n\nSubmit your data and we’ll see where you fit in our next ranking update.\n\nSign up\n\nStay on top of the latest developments in the ecommerce industry.

      "# [Nordstrom family offers $3.76 billion bid to take century-old department store private on 2024-09-04](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nordstrom-family-bid-department-store-private-3-76-billion-mexican-retail-group/)\nMembers of the Nordstrom family with the help of a Mexican retail group are offering to take the century-old department store private for $3.76 billion, months after first expressing interest in a buyout.\n\nIn a letter to the board of directors dated Tuesday, Erik Nordstrom said the Nordstrom family members own about 33.4% of the company's outstanding common stock and is willing to pay investors $23 for each share they own.\n\nThe bid by the Nordstrom family comes as no surprise to analyst Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, who said in a recent note, \"What is interesting is the $23 a share value which is pretty much the current price of the stock. The lack of any real premium would, under normal circumstances, make the offer unattractive. However, as a family run firm the dynamics are slightly different, and it will be up to an independent committee to determine whether this is in the best interests of the company and its investors.\"\n\nThe Mexican retail group, called El Puerto de Liverpool, operates more than 300 stores in Mexico and is that nation's third-largest credit card issuer with over 7.2 million active accounts. It already owns approximately 9.6% of Nordstrom stock.\n\nThe offer represents a premium of nearly 35% to Nordstrom's stock since March 18 when media reports about the proposed transaction first emerged, shares have rallied this year and traded for just above $23 on Wednesday.\n\n\"That the Nordstrom family have made an offer to buy the department store chain comes as no surprise. What is interesting is the $23 a share value which is pretty much the current price of the stock, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData. \"The lack of any real premium would, under normal circumstances, make the offer unattractive. However, as a family-run firm the dynamics are slightly different, and it will be up to an independent committee to determine whether this is in the best interests of the company and its investors.\"\n\nNordstrom last month reported sales growth of 3.4% in the second quarter, as sales in stores open at least a year — a key metric of a retailer's health — rose 1.9%. But net income slipped nearly 11% to $122 million. Adjusted earnings per share totaled 96 cents, and overall results beat analyst estimates. Besides its namesake upscale stores, the company also operates discount Nordstrom Rack stores, which have become a strength.\n\nSales at Nordstrom Rack jumped 8.8% in the most recent quarter and its comparable sales rose 4.1%.\n\n\"The offer comes at a time when Nordstrom is getting back on track after a long period of poor performance,\" Saunders said. \"However, the business remains one of two halves. The department store division has various structural challenges, while the off-price Rack division is starting to produce some good growth. This mixed outlook will limit the amount any party is willing to pay.\"\n\nErik B. and Peter E. Nordstrom are the fourth-generation leaders of the retailer, which was founded in 1901 as a shoe store. Erik is the company's chief executive and Peter is president. In the regulatory filing the family cited the health of their late father Bruce Nordstrom as one impetus behind the proposed transaction. Former chairman Bruce Nordstrom died in May at 90 years old.\n\nThe Nordstroms and their partner say they have commitments for $250 million in new bank financing.\n\nNordstrom, based in Seattle, acknowledged receipt of the proposal and a special committee of the board of directors — which it had already formed in April — will evaluate the offer.\n\nShares of Nordstrom, up 27% this year, edged slightly higher to $23.16 Wednesday.",
      "# [Nordstrom's current take private offer is fair, pros say, as past missteps cost its chance at growth by Brooke DiPalma on 2024-09-06](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nordstroms-current-take-private-offer-is-fair-pros-say-as-past-missteps-cost-its-chance-at-growth-202704181.html)\nThe company, founded in 1901, has only been run by family outsiders once. Various missteps by current management have accelerated its decline.\n\nQuestionable steps include its expansion into Canada, building a flagship store in New York, waiting to expand its Rack stores, and not recognizing increasing demand for direct to consumer, per Swartz.\n\nCanada was unprofitable from the get-go, as there were already \"well-established\" competitors in the market, said Swartz.\n\nIts flagship store in New York, which stretches 285,000 square feet, took six years to complete. Swartz called the decision an \"unorthodox move\" as retailers moved away from building expensive stores.\n\nShortly after it opened in 2018, another iconic department store, Barneys shuttered its doors after declaring bankruptcy.\n\nThe company then waited until recently to expand its Rack business, while discount retailers like TJX (TJX), which owns chains Marshalls, TJ Maxx, and Home Goods, have outperformed department stores for years.\n\nAs of Q2, the company has 269 Nordstrom Rack stores, up from 247 a year ago. It has 94 namesake Nordstrom stores, down from 93 a year ago.\n\n\"The Rack was basically used as a clearing house for excess Nordstrom stock with some very bland brands and not very interesting offers,\" Saunders said of the company's approach.\n\n\"Most off-price, as in Ross, TJX, Burlington, have grown enormously since 2019 ... Rack has barely grown at all,\" added Saunders. \"That is a massive lost opportunity, because off-price has been on fire.\"\n\nAnd Nordstrom, like the rest of the industry, is being hit as shopping trends change.\n\n\"Are [shoppers] going to say Nordstrom as the No. 1 choice? Probably not,\" Swartz said. \"They're probably going to say Lululemon or Alo Yoga ... when people shop for beauty these days, they're more likely to go to a beauty retailer like Sephora or Ulta rather than a department store.\"\n\nBeing private would allow Nordstrom to make long-term decisions without having to answer to the pressure of the public market, but would make it harder to access capital.\n\n\"The business is at a turning point... we've come out of the pandemic. We are now in a phase of reinvention, and it is an opportune time to say we'd like to do that reinvention as a private business,\" Saunders said.\n\nThere has been a wave of privatization and consolidation in the industry. On July 15, Macy's (M) ended discussions of a buyout bid from one of its shareholders, Arkhouse, and its partner, Brigade Capital Management. The offer first became publicly known early last December.\n\n\"One of the things that we've seen in retail the last couple of quarters is an acceleration of the bifurcating trends in retail, between market share winners such as off-price and other specific brands that have newness and innovation that are comping quite positively, and a tougher trend in department stores overall,\" Brooke Roach, a vice president at Goldman Sachs, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nShe added that many retailers, including both Macy's and Nordstrom, have expressed a \"more cautious outlook on their consumer\" in their quarterly earnings.\n\nNordstrom has a long history of being a family business. It wasn't until the late '90s that an outsider, John Whitacre, was named the company's first non-family CEO.\n\nIn 2000, both Whitacre and CFO Michael Stein resigned, and fourth-generation Nordstrom family member Blake Nordstrom was named president.\n\nIn 2015, Blake's brothers, Erik and Peter Nordstrom, also joined the company as co-presidents.\n\nThen, in 2018, with all three at the helm, the Nordstrom family tried to take the company private, but a special committee of the Nordstrom board ended discussions.\n\nIn January 2019, Blake passed away unexpectedly. Erik Nordstrom told Yahoo Finance in April the company is leaning into its heritage with a focus on the consumer to compete in a new era.\n\n\"The future is always with the customer, it's the history of our company, is about taking care of our customers and that goes ... for a lot of us [who] grew up on the shoe floor and you're literally on your hands and knees in front of the customer,\" Erik Nordstrom said.\n\nHe became CEO in 2020, while Peter was named chief brand officer. In early 2023, activist investor Ryan Cohen, who now serves as Gamestop (GME) CEO, started knocking on its door, taking a share in the company and looking to shake up its board.\n\nNeither Saunders nor Swartz saw Cohen as a sizable threat.\n\n\"I don't think [Cohen] knows how to run a department store. Quite frankly, telling the Nordstrom family how to run the business is a little bit rich, in my opinion,\" Saunders said. \"They may not get everything right, and they may have had difficulties, but they do have a great deal of experience in heritage in running a department store.\"\n\nCohen declined to comment to Yahoo Finance, but Nordstrom did add Procter & Gamble executive Guy B. Persaud to the board later on in 2023.\n\nMany shareholders may question if the company should have been managed by outsiders over the years, \"instead of people who happen to have the same last name as on the sign,\" said Swartz.\n\n—\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "# [Liverpool joins Nordstrom family in buyout bid of retail chain by MND Staff on 2024-09-04](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/business/liverpool-joins-bid-nordstrom/)\nMexican retail giant El Puerto de Liverpool (Liverpool) has offered a buyout bid to U.S. retailer Nordstrom, seeking to increase its stake in the company to 49.9% with an investment of at least US $1.23 billion.\n\nEl Puerto de Liverpool, owner of the department store brands Liverpool and Suburbia, already owns about 9.9% of Nordstrom’s stock. In September 2022, it acquired the company’s shares as part of a geographic diversification strategy.\n\nThe move prompted Nordstrom to activate what is known as a “poison pill” in an effort to protect its shareholders from a hostile takeover.\n\nTwo years later, Liverpool is now part of a “win-win” plot that would make it a part owner of the U.S. retail chain. Members of the Nordstrom family are teaming up with Liverpool to buy 100% of Nordstrom and take the company – which was taken public in 1971 – private.\n\nOn Tuesday, CEO Erik B. Nordstrom published a letter to the board of directors stating that the Nordstrom family members own about 33.4% of the company’s outstanding common stock and are willing to offer investors US $23 for each share they own. With around 163.65 million shares outstanding, the buyout bid values Nordstrom at US $3.76 billion.\n\nIn a statement to the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV), Liverpool said, “The transaction is subject to Nordstrom and the negotiating parties reaching a definitive merger agreement.” If the deal were to close, Liverpool and the Nordstrom family would own 49.9% and 50.1% of Nordstrom’s capital stock, respectively.\n\nThe offer represents a nearly 35% premium to Nordstrom’s share price since March 18, when media reports of the proposed transaction first emerged. The retailer’s stock has rallied this year and was trading at just over US $23 on Wednesday.\n\n“That the Nordstrom family have made an offer to buy the department store chain comes as no surprise,” Neil Saunders, managing director of the analytics and consulting company GlobalData, told the Associated Press. Nordstrom family members previously bid to buy out the brand in June 2017 for $50 a share.\n\nThe buyout would be financed through rollover equity and cash commitments by the Nordstrom family and Liverpool, as well as US $250 million in new bank financing.\n\n“The lack of any real premium would, under normal circumstances, make the offer unattractive,” Saunders continued. “However, as a family-run firm the dynamics are slightly different, and it will be up to an independent committee to determine whether this is in the best interests of the company and its investors.”\n\nAs per the details shared by Liverpool, the Mexican company appointed a special committee of independent directors to assess the proposal, which involves a merger between Nordstrom and a U.S. subsidiary of a newly established entity owned by Liverpool and the Nordstrom family.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Liverpool has been involved in a commercial operation with a U.S. company. In 2023, Toys “R” Us parent company WHP Global announced it would launch the U.S. toy brand in Mexico for the first time in alliance with Liverpool.",

      "# [Nordstrom is long gone, but you can still make delicious Nordstrom Cafe tomato soup by Julia O'Malley, \"The Whale, Community in Alaska on 2024-01-11](https://www.adn.com/alaska-life/food-drink/2024/01/11/nordstrom-is-long-gone-but-you-can-still-make-delicious-nordstrom-cafe-tomato-soup/)\nYears ago, I had a lunchtime ritual, just about this time of year, when I found myself working downtown at the courthouse covering trials as a reporter. At lunchtime, I’d walk over to Nordstrom. Man, I miss the grandeur of that swanky, old-fashioned department store with its bustle and style. Remember the incredible gust of perfumed, warm air that hit when you pulled open the doors? Stepping inside off the snowy street felt like entering a portal into a way cooler world. I’d wander by the shoes and purses, hop the elevator to the second floor, stroll past the sharply-dressed mannequins in the “petites” section, and find my way to the lunch line in the busy Nordstrom Cafe. That’s where I could get a quick, delicious bowl of tomato soup, served with a parmesan crisp, and people-watch from a table in the corner while I ate. A thin piece of mint chocolate always came with the bill.\n\nRecently, working in a totally different-feeling, post-pandemic downtown, that warm bowl of soup came to mind with a wash of nostalgia. And, that set me on the path of finding the recipe, which it turns out was published in the Los Angeles Times in 2003. (I am glad I got to enjoy the pleasure of eating it all those years without knowing how much cream it calls for.) The soup is, it turns out, quite cheap and easy to make. The kind of tomatoes you use is the most important thing — bright, sweet San Marzano plum tomatoes in puree are best. You can find them in most grocery stores and often in a three-pack at Costco. If you can’t find them — look for “Italian style” canned tomatoes as a substitute. It does call for ample cream, but you can leave it out and substitute additional broth if you are not into dairy or not trying to hit the exact Nordstorm Cafe note. And, though it isn’t in the official recipe, I like to add just the tiniest pinch of red pepper flakes to the initial saute. A note on the crisps: they work best with freshly grated parm — pre-grated cheese has starch on it that keeps the shreds from really sticking together when they melt.\n\nNordstrom Cafe-style tomato soup with Parmesan crisps\n\n(adapted from the Los Angeles Times)\n\nServes 6, generously\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil\n\n3 carrots, peeled and chopped\n\n1/2 a large yellow onion, chopped\n\n1 and 1/2 teaspoons dried basil\n\n1 28-ounce can whole San Marzano tomatoes in puree\n\n6 cups chicken or vegetable broth\n\n1 cup heavy cream\n\nKosher salt to taste\n\nFreshly ground black pepper to taste\n\n1 tablespoon thinly sliced basil leaves for garnish\n\nFor parmesan crisps:\n\n1 1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese\n\nMethod:\n\nMake the soup:\n\nOver medium heat, warm oil on the bottom of a 4- to 6- quart pot and then add onions, carrots and dried basil. Reduce heat slightly and saute 10 minutes, until carrots are softened and onions are transparent, stirring regularly to make sure nothing burns. Add broth and tomatoes. Simmer over medium-low heat for 20 minutes. You can use this time to make Parmesan crisps below. Remove from heat, allow to cool for 5 minutes. Blend with a hand blender in the pot until smooth or, working in batches, blend in a high-powered blender and then return to the pot. When soup is blended, return to the heat until just beginning to bubble. Remove from heat and stir in cream. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately with a sprinkling of fresh basil and a Parmesan crisp.\n\nMake the crisps:\n\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Using about 3 tablespoons per crisp, sprinkle cheese onto the baking sheet in the form of six small, well-spaced surfboard shapes, roughly 3-4 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide at their thickest part. The cheese should be about an eighth of an inch deep. Bake for 8 minutes, or until the cheese is melted together and toasted but not burned. Remove from the oven, allow to sit on the pan for five minutes, move to a paper towel-lined plate. Serve with soup."

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on Nordstrom\n\n## Company Overview\nNordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) is a leading American luxury department store chain founded in 1901 as a shoe store. The company has evolved to offer a wide range of products, including clothing, accessories, and beauty products, through its more than 350 locations, which include Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, and Nordstrom Local stores. The company is headquartered in Seattle, Washington, and has a strong online presence, ranking No. 21 on Digital Commerce 360’s Top 1000 list of the largest online retailers in North America, with projected online sales of $4.61 billion in 2024 [(Duckett et al., Bloomberg, 2024-09-10)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/09/10/nordstrom-family-makes-bid-to-take-retailer-private/).\n\n## Recent Developments\n### Going Private Proposal\nOn September 4, 2024, the Nordstrom family, led by CEO Erik Nordstrom and President Peter Nordstrom, submitted a $3.76 billion proposal to take the company private, offering $23 per share for the remaining shares they do not already own. This bid is a second attempt by the family to gain full control of the retailer, following a failed attempt in 2017 when they offered $50 per share [(Duckett et al., Bloomberg, 2024-09-10)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/09/10/nordstrom-family-makes-bid-to-take-retailer-private/). The proposal is currently under review by a special committee of independent directors formed by Nordstrom's board [(Duckett et al., CBS News, 2024-09-04)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nordstrom-family-bid-department-store-private-3-76-billion-mexican-retail-group/).\n\n### Financial Performance\nIn Q2 2024, Nordstrom reported a 3.4% increase in net sales, reaching $3.8 billion, with digital sales accounting for 37% of total revenue, up from 36% the previous year. The company's Nordstrom Rack stores have also shown strong performance, with sales jumping 8.8% in the most recent quarter [(Duckett et al., Bloomberg, 2024-09-10)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/09/10/nordstrom-family-makes-bid-to-take-retailer-private/). However, net income slipped nearly 11% to $122 million, indicating mixed financial health [(Duckett et al., CBS News, 2024-09-04)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nordstrom-family-bid-department-store-private-3-76-billion-mexican-retail-group/).\n\n### Supply Chain Optimization\nNordstrom has recently ceased plans for a new omnichannel center in the Pacific Northwest, citing improvements in its existing supply chain operations. CEO Erik Nordstrom noted that the company has achieved a 5% increase in click-to-delivery speed and lower fulfillment costs, allowing them to serve customers more efficiently without the added costs of new construction [(Carranza, Retail Dive, 2024-09-09)](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nordstrom-cancels-west-coast-fulfillment-omnichannel-build-out/726193/).\n\n## Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions\nThe Nordstrom family is partnering with Mexico-based retailer El Puerto de Liverpool, which holds a 9.6% stake in Nordstrom, to finance the proposed buyout. Liverpool operates over 300 stores and is the third-largest credit card issuer in Mexico, indicating a strategic move to leverage Liverpool's resources and market presence [(Duckett et al., Bloomberg, 2024-09-10)](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2024/09/10/nordstrom-family-makes-bid-to-take-retailer-private/).\n\n## Executive Leadership\nErik Nordstrom and Peter Nordstrom, both fourth-generation leaders of the company, have been at the helm during a challenging period for the retailer. Erik Nordstrom emphasized the importance of focusing on customer service and adapting to changing market conditions, stating, \"The future is always with the customer, it's the history of our company\" [(DiPalma, Yahoo Finance, 2024-09-06)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nordstroms-current-take-private-offer-is-fair-pros-say-as-past-missteps-cost-its-chance-at-growth-202704181.html).\n\n## Challenges and Market Position\nDespite recent sales stabilization, Nordstrom faces significant challenges, including competition from off-price retailers and changing consumer preferences. Analysts have noted that while the Nordstrom Rack division is performing well, the traditional department store segment is struggling with structural challenges [(DiPalma, Yahoo Finance, 2024-09-06)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nordstroms-current-take-private-offer-is-fair-pros-say-as-past-missteps-cost-its-chance-at-growth-202704181.html). The company's mixed outlook may limit the attractiveness of any buyout offer, as potential buyers weigh the risks associated with the department store model [(Duckett et al., CBS News, 2024-09-04)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nordstrom-family-bid-department-store-private-3-76-billion-mexican-retail-group/).\n\n## Conclusion\nNordstrom is at a pivotal moment in its history, with the potential to transition to a private company under the leadership of its founding family. While the company has shown resilience in its sales performance, it must navigate significant challenges in the retail landscape. The outcome of the proposed buyout and the strategic decisions made in the coming months will be critical in determining Nordstrom's future trajectory. Investors and prospective candidates should closely monitor these developments as they unfold."
