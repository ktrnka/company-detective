      "# Post ID 1d48gw6: Voice Artists who have AI model? Best model out there? with +0 score by [(MaesterJones, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceActing/comments/1d48gw6/voice_artists_who_have_ai_model_best_model_out/)\nI attended a webinar months ago discussing AI and heard from some current actors who have made a model of their voice for client usage. Carin Gilfrey was one of them, who uses VocaliD. \n\nI cant remember the other actors who were there, or what companies they worked with, but I want to explore creating an AI model of my voice. \n\nHave any of you created a model? How does your pricing structure work? How much did it cost you to create? For those of you that have explored, who has the \"best\" model? \n\n## Comment ID l6cplbb with +7 score by [(ReluctantToast777, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceActing/comments/1d48gw6/voice_artists_who_have_ai_model_best_model_out/l6cplbb/) (in reply to ID 1d48gw6):\nAny actor who is a spokesperson for an AI company is likely getting paid to talk about it, and that's always something to keep in mind when looking for a vendor for anything. The fact Carin has what is essentially a VocaliD ad on her website is a red flag too, imo.\n\nAfter 5 minutes of research into VocaliD, they have no transparent pricing on their site, several of their website links are broken (including the link to their referred ethics organization, lol), and I see they're a child company of Veritone, which is publicly traded (not inherently bad, but they have to adhere to shareholders if they want to succeed, so I don't trust that they are committed to acting ethically.) Checking their financials, they've had constant negative growth by tens of millions of dollars over the past 5 years, so they're clearly not profitable at all.\n\nYou're going to find similar things everywhere you look. Instead of customer-facing features, I'd look at company history, funding partners, staff, etc. None of these services are sustainable currently (just funded by venture capital + rich people), so discussions of customer-facing price to me feel arbitrary. If that's all you care about though, then I'm sure others can give you recommendations of what \\*they've\\* used (though I doubt anyone has done extensive research, personally).\n\n(Imo, why actors aren't getting educated on how models work + how one might make one locally is beyond me. That's really the only way to \"own\" your voice. We need more tech-savvy people in the VO community.)\n\nTL;DR - There is no \"best\" unless you're thinking short-term gains. Look into creating locally or vet the hell out of services.\n\n### Comment ID l6ct59d with +2 score by [(MaesterJones, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceActing/comments/1d48gw6/voice_artists_who_have_ai_model_best_model_out/l6ct59d/) (in reply to ID l6cplbb):\nGreat points, thanks for the reply. \n\n>I see they're a child company of Veritone,\n\nAh, I have a meeting with these guys next week. This is the *one* name of the company I wrote down in my notes. \n\n>I'd look at company history, funding partners, staff\n\nI'll see what can be dug up. \n\n>There is no \"best\" unless you're thinking short-term gains. Look into creating locally or vet the hell out of services.\n\nIt's the wild west out there. Companies could collapse next year, or be bought out by competitors. I  wish I had the know how to create my own algorithm, but that is far beyond my technical knowledge lol. Vetting is part of the reason I'm here. Wanted to see if any of you had 1st hand experience that I can consider in addition to what's on the web. \n\nI see and hear about lower end jobs that are getting swept away by AI. My goal is to hopefully capitalize on this, and maybe grab a small piece of the market, positioning myself to be the best of both worlds for the client. This is all new, it's all untested, and I'm not planning on jumping on board soon, but I do think there is opportunity here. \n\nThanks again for your input!\n\n#### Comment ID l6fqwl6 with +2 score by [(ReluctantToast777, Reddit, 2024-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceActing/comments/1d48gw6/voice_artists_who_have_ai_model_best_model_out/l6fqwl6/) (in reply to ID l6ct59d):\nYeah, totally makes sense to scope things out!\n\nNot sure which questions are allowed in your meeting, but I would be curious to know how transparent + truthful they end up being with their sourcing + business operations. At the end of the day, they can disclose whatever they want I suppose, but the more transparency, the better imo. I'm assuming most potential clients don't dig into those kinds of questions anyway, lol.\n\n\"Wild West\" is 100% accurate. It's a bummer SAG-AFTRA gave up so easily when we haven't established regulations nor frameworks for getting, at the very least, local models created, so actors have innately more leverage overall. You would think there would be \\*some\\* guidance as to who is reputable/trustworthy amidst the sea of terrible + predatory services out there. But nah, they just decided to partner with a random company (aka Replica) that could \\*maybe\\* give them more leverage for the IMA, lol. (Mini-rant over, XD)\n\nI'm personally trying to find the time to research model creation myself (software development is my day job), just so I can help contribute to the guidance that \\*should\\* already exist. But we'll see how it goes!",

      "# Post ID 1bm3skn: Epiphone B.B king Lucille- is it worth it? with +2 score by [(mmfm1984, Reddit, 2024-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/)\nDoes anyone own a Epiphone BB King Lucille guitar with the veritone switch?\n\nWhat do you think? Is it worth the money? Do you find the switch allows you to do more with your set up without a million pedals/changing instruments?\n\nI have a Les Paul, Stratocaster, Sg and a McCarty PRS (the push pull pots on the McCarty are what's getting me interested in veritone switch) I am going to add a semi/hollow body guitar to my guitar collection and need some opinions. \n\n\nIn my search I fell in love with the Epiphone Lucille .The binding and hardware is beautiful and the guitar has got flash. Most of all, it's the SOUND on every review video that sets it apart for me.\n \nThis would be my first Epiphone purchase and it's a hefty price tag in comparison to other Epiphone instruments. \n\nThat's why I want to ask anyone who has experience with hollow body's because videos are designed to sell products.\n\nI have yet to play one, which could sink the boat if I hate the feel, but i wanted to ask y'all if you had any opinions on this instrument?  if you have a semi/hollow body that is your go to? Any opinions on Epiphone hollowbodys\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n## Comment ID kw9bb4p with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kw9bb4p/) (in reply to ID 1bm3skn):\nI played one years ago and liked it. I cant remember the veritone switch, thats probably not something Id personally look. But 335 style guitars are some of my absolute favorites. They are super versatile, you can get grear blues, rock, jazz, country tones, the list goes on. Its got a short scale like a les paul but they're a lot easier on the back.\n\n## Comment ID kw9unjv with +4 score by [(obscured_by_turtles, Reddit, 2024-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kw9unjv/) (in reply to ID 1bm3skn):\nI've played a couple and been tempted, both the Epiphone and Gibson models.  The Lucille can be a bit heavier than a 335 type.\n\nThe Varitone has  uses but many players set it to the 'bypass' position.   It's mostly found on Gibson ES-345 and sometimes ES-355 models plus the Lucille.\n\nIt's more than a tone control, which just uses a capacitor to roll high frequencies off.  Varitones include an inductor or choke with capacitors to subtract some specific frequencies.\n\nNote that some of the classic guitars the Varitone was used on, also had the pickups out of phase.\n\nThis video has an explanation and demonstration using a Gibson ES-345:\n\n[https://youtu.be/hAHm7X8xmp4?si=2gnuLn5FGyd4pVp1](https://youtu.be/hAHm7X8xmp4?si=2gnuLn5FGyd4pVp1)\n\nAnd the lovely and talented Chris Buck demoing a varitone:\n\n[https://youtu.be/YENmNQh-SEA?si=uhmzGXPRxAbw7kTd](https://youtu.be/YENmNQh-SEA?si=uhmzGXPRxAbw7kTd)\n\nThe thread at this link includes a wiring diagram:\n\n[https://forum.gibson.com/topic/127119-varitone-wiring/](https://forum.gibson.com/topic/127119-varitone-wiring/)\n\nFor myself, the semi-hollow I used for some years is a 1973 Guild Starfire IV.   My last gig involved a 2003 Gretsch Anniversary, which is a wonderful guitar.   Have not gigged with my 335.\n\nMost of the time right now I have on hand a somewhat abused 61 reissue Epi Casino,  made in China but assembled in Nashville with US electronics.  Traded an Epi Wildkat that I never bonded with.   The Casino fell out of favour by the early-mid 1960's as stage volumes rose.  Being fully hollow, feedback is a real issue in that circumstance, but otherwise it's an excellent guitar.\n\n### Comment ID kwbv5yx with +2 score by [(mmfm1984, Reddit, 2024-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kwbv5yx/) (in reply to ID kw9unjv):\nThanks!!\n\n## Comment ID kwad4am with +3 score by [(GibsonMaestro, Reddit, 2024-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kwad4am/) (in reply to ID 1bm3skn):\nI have an Epi Les Paul Florentine, which is a semi-hollow Les Paul. However, it comes PRObuckers, which I find more dynamic then the Alnico Classic PROs that come in the Lucille. However, it's a routed LP body, and is probably isn't a fair comparison. \n\nI also own a Squier CV Starcaster, which is built more closely to the specs of Lucille, and is very similar to the Lucille. Unplugged, it's loud. Plugged in, it's no different than a solid body, and you'll find the same with Lucille. \n\nA semi-hollow has the pickups installed directly into the center block, and is essentially a 2x4 electric guitar with hollow wings. Depending on the model, it could sound exactly like your LP.\n\nThe benefit of a semi-hollow is the light weight, not any specific \"hollow\" sound.\n\n## Comment ID kw9bkyx with +1 score by [(mmfm1984, Reddit, 2024-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kw9bkyx/) (in reply to ID 1bm3skn):\nThanks!

But you have to keep in mind that some people need different kind of guitar for the styles they play. A gibson les paul loaded with classic hambuckers can't go very will in super hi gain situation and can't be as funky as a strat for example.\n\n#### Comment ID ggzk804 with +11 score by [(Pierson230, Reddit, 2020-12-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/kjqpri/question_if_you_had_2500_to_buy_a_new_guitar_what/ggzk804/) (in reply to ID ggzhil4):\nFor sure, which is why I said, “to me.”  \n\nI was collecting all kinds of different guitars for different tones.  Tele for the bridge sound, Strat for the neck sound, a PRS for a modern jack of all trades, a dedicated “metal” guitar with active pickups, a long scale for different spacing, different neck radii for playing styles, maple neck for this and mahogany neck for that. \n\nAt some point I came to feel that my music basically only used 5 tones.  And with modern modeling software, I could get the right guitar to sound like basically anything I needed it to sound like.  I don’t care about sounding like Artist X on record Y.  \n\nI saw that groups like Gojira used low output humbuckers to get what I feel is a great high gain sound.  I modified my high gain sound for a regular wind bridge humbucker.  I found that getting a low wind neck humbucker and dialing in my EQ, it was as clear as I wanted it to be, enough to make my Fenders redundant.  \n\nThen I found using one guitar to be liberating.  I was spending more time on the music and less time on gear, wondering which guitar to use.  So I basically got rid of anything that wasn’t a Les Paul, and now I keep one for a different tuning, and another less expensive one to take on the road.  It’s basically one guitar with the luxury of convenience and a “beater” version.”  \n\nFinding the right equipment and setup for an individual’s style is absolutely important, and different people will clearly gravitate towards different guitars.  \n\nI just thought I’d share my perspective- I’d rather have fewer guitars, period, but I probably needed to go through my whole journey of “a guitar for this and a guitar for that” to figure that out.  \n\nOf course, there’s nothing wrong with having 500 guitars if that’s what inspires people musically.

Thick neck patterns are where it’s at.

Can’t say that as much with Fender and definitely not Gibson.

With that being said, you would be better Suited getting multiple mid-range guitars, or a mid-range guitar and amp. Heck, for $2500 you could buy two guitars and a decent amp. The fact is, a more expensive guitar is not necessarily a better guitar. I honestly find that anything above $1000 is not going to be worth the extra cost. The only exception to that is if you want to buy vintage guitars. \n\nIf it were me, I would buy a Brent Hinds Flying V, a Fender Starcaster, and a Fender Mustang GTX 50 (amp).\n\n## Comment ID ggyouyp with +1 score by [(tdteddy0382, Reddit, 2020-12-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/kjqpri/question_if_you_had_2500_to_buy_a_new_guitar_what/ggyouyp/) (in reply to ID kjqpri):\nTaylor 314 ce.

Before it was a concert venue, it was a mill since around the turn of the 20th century. The wood itself was from an old-growth local forest before that.\n\nPeople are going to argue that the wood doesn't matter. They're wrong, but it doesn't matter...that's still really freaking cool.\n\nI'd probably go for that before any production guitar in that price range....but (strangely) it would actually depend on where in the venue the wood came from. There was one specific room that I only ever had bad experiences in, and if the wood came from there, it'd be a deal-breaker. At least one of the interviews about it mentioned that room, specifically...which is most of the reason I haven't looked into it more closely yet. Well, that and the fear of dropping that much money on a guitar that I might not end up liking. I really like playing a guitar before buying it.\n\nIDK...there are a lot of great guitars in a lot of styles in that price range, but unless something hits you as \"I want *that*\", I don't think the intrinsic quality of a $2500 guitar is all that much higher than a $1000-$1500 guitar....I've definitely never played one that was *obviously* that much better than the next level down unless you really hate poly finishes or something. I've played some in that range that I really liked...but not enough to fork over the cash for one.\n\n## Comment ID ggzibm2 with +1 score by [(tidybum, Reddit, 2020-12-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/kjqpri/question_if_you_had_2500_to_buy_a_new_guitar_what/ggzibm2/) (in reply to ID kjqpri):\nMartin D-28\n\n## Comment ID ggzjctg with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2020-12-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/kjqpri/question_if_you_had_2500_to_buy_a_new_guitar_what/ggzjctg/) (in reply to ID kjqpri):\nid buy a cheap £20 dollar store electric guitar then spend the rest on weed\n\n## Comment ID ggzkjru with +1 score by [(dkclimber, Reddit, 2020-12-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/kjqpri/question_if_you_had_2500_to_buy_a_new_guitar_what/ggzkjru/) (in reply to ID kjqpri):\nHwy 1 Strat, Blues Jr. and a Boss GT1000\n\n## Comment ID ggzldbu with +1 score by [(ElectricInstinct, Reddit, 2020-12-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/kjqpri/question_if_you_had_2500_to_buy_a_new_guitar_what/ggzldbu/) (in reply to ID kjqpri):\nHonestly, I’d say don’t feel as if you have to spend the $2500 just because you can.  But, knowing you have the budget, try every guitar within your budget that you can.\n\nYou might pick up two Les Pauls and love one but hate the other, you know.\n\nIf you’re spending that much money, you really need to take a serious look at what kinds of music you like to hear and also what types of music you like to play.  Then you should go out and get the best guitar that meets your needs.\n\nI know this is anecdotal, but as personal proof that spending the most money doesn’t always mean you’ll get the best guitar:  I have an absolutely stunning looking and deliciously sounding $2800 Les Paul.

Easily.  Google leads in every layer of the AI stack from silicon all the way up to the applications.   There is nobody and I mean nobody close to where Google is at with full stack AI.\n\nLowest layer is silicon and their TPUs have been setting records with both training and inference at scale.\n\n\"Google's TPU Pods are Breaking Records — And We Aren't Surprised\"\n\nhttps://blog.bitvore.com/googles-tpu-pods-are-breaking-benchmark-records\n\nNext layer up above the silicon is basically the AI operating system. The most popular today is TensorFlow which is from Google. The second most popular is Pytorch from Facebook.  \n\nTensorFlow now has over 150K stars on Github.\n\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow\n\nOne of the most popular projects on Github.\n\nTensorflow is also the most desired by AI engineers across the world based on the annual stackoverflow developer survey.\n\nhttps://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/\n\nThe next layer above the framework is the algorithms. The best way to measure success with algorithms is the papers accepted at the canonical AI organization, NeurlIPS. In 2018, 2019, 2020 and sure will be the same in 2021 has seen Google having the most papers accepted by a large margin.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/ZWeeqUg\n\nNext layer is data. Which is probably where people most think of Google and Facebook. But Google has the more valuable data.\n\nFacebook data is what you want people to think of you. Versus Google has more truthful information. There is probably no more valuable data than search queries you make. It is this very unusual window into who you are. \n\nBut with Google there is then all their other services.\n\nYouTube has the video data. Google Maps the location data. Google Photos is the biggest repository of photos. The list goes on and on.\n\nThe next layer up is the applications. Search is the biggest AI/ML driven application in the world. Search penetrates 99% of the population of the US and then on top of that Google now has over 90% share.\n\nhttps://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share\n\nBut probably the most impressive thing I have ever seen in terms of AI\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avdpprICvNI\n\nThere is tons of other examples.  Look at what Google has been able to accomplish with protein folding.  They now have 1000s of bilogist using their AlphaFold daily.\n\nI believe the goal of search from basically day 1 was AGI.   It is why we see Google more and more just giving the answer.   Google has been able to increase the number to over 2/3 of queries now do not require a click.   That is the vector they will use to get to AGI.  I would fully expect Google to get there first.\n\nGoogle also knows that someone else solving AGI besides Google would be a HUGE threat to search.\n\n## Comment ID il47o3y with +50 score by [(MrZwink, Reddit, 2022-08-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wti1n2/best_artificial_intelligence_machine_learning/il47o3y/) (in reply to ID wti1n2):\nI would still say: google, Microsoft, apple, amazon, tesla in that order.\n\n### Comment ID il4bump with +19 score by [(Nordic4tKnight, Reddit, 2022-08-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wti1n2/best_artificial_intelligence_machine_learning/il4bump/) (in reply to ID il47o3y):\nNvidia too?\n\n### Comment ID il4bd35 with +3 score by [(mesosouper, Reddit, 2022-08-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wti1n2/best_artificial_intelligence_machine_learning/il4bd35/) (in reply to ID il47o3y):\nAgree.

Aside from it being a very competitive space, RPA is very flawed in its licensing. Users are able to run as many “processes” as they’d like on a single license, which means they can pile all their back office processes onto a small number of licenses. Sometimes they literally run them on just 2 or 3 licenses. \n\nIn the early days of UiPath, customer hadn’t caught onto this and were aggressively oversold. There have been a huge number of angry customers reducing their license count or leaving UiPath completely for something more affordable and scalable like Microsoft Power Automate. \n\nUiPath had 1 goal and 1 goal only in mind… go public.

Others are let go under 12 months. Would you like to lose your job after 8 months? This company operates as if it's a factory manufacturing widgets. Focusing on quantity, not quality. Imagine a pinball bouncing around aimlessly, constantly changing direction. Something is a major fire one week, forgotten the next, with a new urgent priority replacing it, and the cycle continues. Too much work/quantity on one's plate, and a feeling of constant scrambling and 'keeping up' becomes the norm. Makes for a hectic and unhealthy environment. And when quarterly revenue isn't met, expenses get cut to compensate and offset, and you will most certainly lose your job.",

While I can understand previous comments about lack of direction in previous years, I think this is changing with new CEO, recent executive hires, and a deepening of its focus around Generative AI, which has a bright future. Good benefits are key to me, and Veritone has put a lot of effort this past year into providing Top Tier benefits while absorbing most of the cost (up to 80%). Having worked or interviewed with similar sized companies (under 1000 employees) over the past decade, it's refreshing to see a company not make you pay for 50% of the fast rising US healthcare costs. Since I am married with a few kids, it's putting hundreds of dollars per month back in my pocket. Plus ESSP and 401k match programs have ramped up, which are benefits I haven't been offered in years.",

Then they yell at everyone to do work faster / sooner even though they oversold it.\n- CEO only cares about the stock price because he has millions of shares of stock. Unfortunately, stock price is in the tank, which means trying to take “big swings” at growing the company thru acquisitions and/or business pivots, abandoning many of the people and clients who helped them get to where they are today.\n- furloughs and layoffs are rampant.

Good benefits are key to me, and Veritone has put a lot of effort this past year into providing Top Tier benefits while absorbing most of the cost (up to 80%). Having worked or interviewed with similar sized companies (under 1000 employees) over the past decade, it's refreshing to see a company not make you pay for 50% of the fast rising US healthcare costs. Since I am married with a few kids, it's putting hundreds of dollars per month back in my pocket.

(NASDAQ:VERI), a leader in designing human-centered AI solutions, today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n“Veritone delivered a strong performance in the second quarter, driven by accelerated growth across our AI software products and services and advertising managed services. During the quarter, we secured 17 new Public Sector customers and saw our Public Sector sales pipeline reach unprecedented levels, and completed a landmark deal with the NCAA, representing our largest contract to date based on run rate,” said Ryan Steelberg, CEO & President of Veritone. “Our strategic partnership with Amazon Web Services continues to expand rapidly through our Strategic Collaboration Agreement, unlocking new opportunities and driving innovation. The focused execution of our strategic initiatives, including cost reductions and resource alignment, is yielding tangible results. We also announced we are in a formal process and are progressing towards divesting one of our non-software assets, advancing our objectives to improve our balance sheet and overall liquidity, and enhance our operational efficiency. As we transition our focus from cost reductions back to growth, we are confident in our ability to capitalize on the demand for AI-driven solutions and deliver long-term value to our shareholders.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\n\nCalculated on a Pro Forma basis where noted; for additional information on these calculations, see “Note Regarding Pro Forma Information” and the definitions provided for each metric cited.\n\nRevenue of $31.0 million, an increase of 11% compared to Q2 2023.\n\nSoftware Products and Services revenues of $15.6 million, an increase of 11% compared to GAAP revenue of $14.1 million in Q2 2023, and a decrease of 25% when compared to Pro Forma Software Revenue for Q2 2023 driven by the decline in consumption-based revenue from customers, including Amazon.\n\nManaged Services revenue of $15.4 million, an increase of 11% compared to Q2 2023 driven by an increase in advertising year over year.\n\nTotal Software Products & Services Customers of 3,437, down 7% year over year, as compared to June 30, 2023 on a pro forma basis, largely driven by planned migration of legacy CareerBuilder customers off the Broadbean software platform.\n\nTotal New Bookings of $14.0 million, up 67% from $8.4 million in Q2 2023 driven by an increase in subscription-based customer bookings.\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) of $67.9 million, down from $107.9 million in Q2 2023 on a Pro Forma basis driven by declines in consumption-based revenue principally from our largest customer, offset by a 3% increase from recurring subscription-based SaaS revenue customers.\n\nLoss from Operations of $17.7 million, as compared to a loss of $28.2 million in Q2 2023 driven by the increase in revenue and lower overall operating expenses resulting from our past cost reduction plans and lower professional fees related to past acquisitions and divestitures.\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit of $24.4 million, an increase of 21% or $4.2 million as compared to Q2 2023 primarily due to an increase in revenue and improved Non-GAAP gross margins of 78.8% as compared to 72.2% in Q2 2023.\n\nNet Loss of $22.2 million, as compared to $23.3 million in Q2 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP Net Loss of $6.9 million, improving 47% as compared to Q2 2023.\n\nAbout Our Sales Pipeline\n\nOur sales pipeline represents revenue we expect to receive based on the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts outstanding at the end of the quarter and contracts that we believe have a high probability of closing in the next three to twelve months. We include in our sales pipeline fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term and we do not include any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services) and any fees payable after contract renewals or extensions that are at the discretion of our client. Many of our contracts require us to provide services over more than one year and may include professional fees required to enable our technology in certain environments we do not host or have direct control over. In some cases, our customers may have the ability to terminate our agreements on short notice and our pipeline does not consider the potential impact of any early termination.

Veritone completed its acquisition of (i) all of the issued and outstanding share capital of (a) Broadbean Technology Pty Ltd ACN 116 011 959 / ABN 79 116 011 959, a limited company incorporated under the laws of Australia, (b) Broadbean Technology Limited, a limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, (c) Broadbean, Inc., a Delaware corporation and (d) CareerBuilder France S.A.R.L., a limited liability company organized (société à responsabilité limitée) under the laws of France, and (ii) certain assets and liabilities related thereto (the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) together, “Broadbean”) on June 13, 2023.

In prior periods, we provided “Ending Software Customers,” which represented Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each fiscal quarter with trailing twelve-month revenues in excess of $2,400 for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. and/or deemed by Veritone to be under an active contract for the applicable periods. Total Software Products & Services Customers is not comparable to Ending Software Customers. Total Software Products & Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve month basis and excludes any customers that are on trial or pilot status with us rather than including customers with active contracts. Management uses Total Software Products & Services Customers and we believe Total Software Products & Services Customers are useful to investors because it more accurately reflects our total customers for our Software Products & Services inclusive of Broadbean.\n\n(4) “Annual Recurring Revenue” is calculated as Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), which is an annualized calculation of the monthly recurring revenue in the last month of the calculated quarter for all active Software Products & Services customers, combined with Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) which is the trailing twelve month calculation of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Software Products & Services customers. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue is on a Pro Forma basis where indicated, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenues.\n\n(5)“Total New Bookings” represents the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts received in the quarter (including fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term), excluding any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services), in each case on a Pro Forma basis where indicated.\n\n(6) “Gross Revenue Retention” represents our dollar-based gross retention rate as of the period end by starting with the revenue from Software Products & Services Customers as of the 3 months in the prior year quarter to such period, or Prior Year Quarter Revenue. We then deduct from the Prior Year Quarter Revenue any revenue from Software Products & Services Customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue. We then divide the total Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue by the total Prior Year Quarter Revenue to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of revenue from all Software Products & Services Customers from our Software Products & Services as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn. All numbers used to determine Gross Revenue Retention are calculated on a Pro Forma basis where indicated.\n\n* See tables below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to directly comparable GAAP measures and for the definitions used for Software Products & Services Supplemental Financial Information.\n\nRecent Business Highlights\n\nPublic Sector closed 17 new public safety and government customers, including the Defense Logistics Agency, a division of US Department of Defense and the US Senate, and announced the appointment of Gus Hunt, former CIA Chief Technology Officer, as an advisor.\n\nSigned over 23 new Media & Entertainment deals in the second quarter, including a multi-year contract with the NCAA, which is expected to generate up to $40 million over the term, new deals with Tennis Australia and notable renewals and deal expansions with NBC Universal, CNBC, CNN, and Bloomberg.\n\nVeritone Hire signed significant new enterprise programmatic advertising and job distribution software deals, including global brands such as Sevita, Whole Foods, Best Buy, and Harrods and completed the beta launch of programmatic advertising solution and programmatic publisher network in Australia.\n\nAnnounced Strategic Collaboration Agreement (SCA) with Amazon Web Services (AWS), which will leverage Veritone’s and AWS’ unique strengths to accelerate cloud-native enterprise AI and generative AI innovation for new and existing customers across sectors.\n\nContinued strong advertising momentum, with top-line media bookings increasing 12% year-over-year from Veritone One and saw substantial growth from key customers such as Mint Mobile, LinkedIn, DraftKings, and Quince.\n\nAnnounced formal process to divest a non-software asset with multiple qualified bidders, which, if consummated, is expected to generate substantial cash proceeds to be used to repay a portion of the Company’s term debt and fund future operations.\n\nFinancial Results for Three Months Ended June 30, 2024\n\nDelivered second quarter revenue of $31.0 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 11% from $28.0 million in the second quarter of 2023. Software Products & Services revenue of $15.6 million increased $1.5 million or 11% year over year driven by the Q2 2023 acquisition of Broadbean, which generated $8.7 million in revenue in Q2 2024, offset by the decline in legacy Veritone Hire revenue over the same period, including declines in revenue from Amazon. Managed Services revenue of $15.4 million increased $1.5 million or 11% year over year principally due to an improvement in advertising services.\n\nLoss from operations of $17.7 million improved by $10.5 million as compared to a loss of $28.2 million in Q2 2023 driven in part by a net $7.5 million decrease in operating expenses including the impact of the Q2 2023 Broadbean Acquisition, and the $3.0 million increase in revenue. The $7.5 million net decline in operating expenses was driven by legacy cost reductions, coupled with lower professional fees related to acquisitions and divestitures of $4.0 million year over year driven by the second quarter 2023 Broadbean acquisition. Non-GAAP gross margin of 78.8% improved by 660 basis points from 72.2% in the second quarter of 2023. GAAP net loss was $22.2 million, compared to GAAP net loss of $23.3 million in the second quarter of 2023, driven by the $10.5 million improvement in loss from operations, offset by (i) an increase of $3.8 million in net interest expense largely associated with the Company’s December 2023 term loan, which included $1.4 million of non-cash amortization associated with the initial discount and issuance costs of the term loan, (ii) a one-time gain of $2.6 million from the divestiture of the Company’s energy division in the second quarter of 2023, (iii) a $1.6 million decline in foreign currency gains and (iv) a $1.3 million decline in the Company's tax benefit. Non-GAAP net loss of $6.9 million improved by 47% when compared to Non-GAAP net loss of $13.0 million in the second quarter of 2023, largely driven by the increase in Non-GAAP gross profit, coupled with reductions in our cost structure since the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, Total Software Product & Services Customers of 3,437 was down 7% year over year relative to Total Software Product & Services Customers on a Pro Forma basis as of June 30, 2023, principally due to planned migration of legacy CareerBuilder customers off the Broadbean software platform. Total New Bookings on a Pro Forma basis increased by 67% to $14.0 million versus the comparable period a year ago largely driven by an increase in subscription-based customer bookings, offset by a reduction in revenue from consumption-based customers, including Amazon. Annual Recurring Revenue on a Pro Forma basis of $67.9 million decreased 37% year over year driven in large part by the decline in consumption spending from customers, offset by a 3% year over year increase in Annual Recurring Revenue from subscription-based SaaS customers. Excluding the decline in consumption-based spending from Amazon, Software Products & Services revenue growth would have increased over 50% year over year.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $46.0 million, including approximately $39.3 million of cash received from advertising customers for future payments to vendors.\n\nBusiness Outlook\n\nThird Quarter 2024\n\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $34.0 million to $35.0 million, as compared to $35.1 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $2.6 million to $4.0 million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $7.9 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nFull Year 2024\n\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $136.0 million to $142.0 million, as compared to $127.6 million for fiscal 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $11.0 million to $15.0 million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $37.3 million for fiscal 2023.\n\nThese updated financial guidance ranges supersede any previously disclosed financial guidance and investors should not rely on any previously disclosed financial guidance.\n\nConference Call\n\nVeritone will hold a conference call to deliver management’s prepared remarks on August 8, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its second quarter 2024 results, provide an update on the business and conduct a question-and-answer session.

The Company also provides certain key performance indicators (KPIs), including Total Software Products & Services Customers, Annual Recurring Revenue, Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), Total New Bookings and Gross Revenue Retention. The Company has posted additional supplemental financial information on its website at investors.veritone.com concurrently with this press release.\n\nPro Forma Software Revenue represents Software Products & Services revenue on a Pro Forma basis. Non-GAAP gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as Non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, respectively, is the Company’s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, adjusted to exclude provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of warrant liability, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, interest income, interest expense, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition and due diligence costs, gain on sale of energy group, contribution of business held for sale, variable consultant performance bonus expense, and severance and executive transition costs. The items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a breakdown of GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and these excluded items between the Company’s Core Operations and Corporate, are detailed in the reconciliations included following the financial statements attached to this news release. In addition, following the financial statements attached to this news release, the Company has provided additional supplemental non-GAAP measures of operating expenses, loss from operations, other income (expense), net, and loss before income taxes, excluding the items excluded from non-GAAP net loss as noted above, and reconciling such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\nThe Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures and KPIs because management believes such information to be important supplemental measures of performance that are commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. Management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other financial measures so calculated and presented, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Other companies (including the Company’s competitors) may define these non-GAAP financial measures differently. The non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the historical operating results of Veritone or predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn addition, the Company defines the following capitalized terms in this news release as follows:\n\nCore Operations consists of the Company’s aiWARE operating platform of software, SaaS and related services; content licensing and advertising agency services; and their supporting operations, including direct costs of sales as well as operating expenses for sales, marketing and product development and certain general and administrative costs dedicated to these operations.\n\nCorporate principally consists of general and administrative functions such as executive, finance, legal, people operations, fixed overhead expenses (including facilities and information technology expenses), other income (expenses) and taxes, and other expenses that support the entire Company, including public company driven costs.\n\nSoftware Products & Services consists of revenues generated from commercial enterprise and government and regulated industries customers using our aiWARE platform and Hiring Solutions, any related support and maintenance services, and any related professional services associated with the deployment and/or implementation of such solutions.\n\nManaged Services consist of revenues generated from commercial enterprise customers using our content licensing services and advertising agency and related services.\n\nAbout Veritone\n\nVeritone (NASDAQ: VERI) builds human-centered enterprise AI solutions.

In addition, words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “outlook,” “should,” “could,” “estimate,” “confident” or “continue” or the plural, negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements, and any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and are based on management’s current assumptions, expectations, beliefs and information. As such, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement as a result of various factors. Important factors that could cause such differences include, among other things, our ability to expand our aiWARE SaaS business; declines or limited growth in the market for AI-based software applications and concerns over the use of AI that may hinder the adoption of AI technologies; our requirements for additional capital and liquidity to support our operations, our business growth, service our debt obligations and refinance maturing debt obligations, and the availability of such capital on acceptable terms, if at all; our reliance upon a limited number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue; declines in customers’ usage of our products and other offerings; our ability to realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures, and other planned or ongoing cost-saving measures, including our ability to successfully integrate our recent acquisition of Broadbean; our identification of existing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; fluctuations in our results over time; the impact of seasonality on our business; our ability to manage our growth, including through acquisitions and expansion into international markets; our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance and keep pace with technological developments; actions by our competitors, partners and others that may block us from using third party technologies in our aiWARE platform, offering it for free to the public or making it cost prohibitive to continue to incorporate such technologies into our platform; interruptions, performance problems or security issues with our technology and infrastructure, or that of our third party service providers; the impact of the continuing economic disruption caused by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the war in Israel, financial instability, high interest rates, inflationary pressures and the responses by central banking authorities to control inflation, monetary supply shifts and the threat of recession in the United States and around the world on our business operations and those of our existing and potential customers; and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Certain of these judgments and risks are discussed in more detail in our most recently-filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our most recently-filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other periodic reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Veritone completed its acquisition of (i) all of the issued and outstanding share capital of (a) Broadbean Technology Pty Ltd ACN 116 011 959 / ABN 79 116 011 959, a limited company incorporated under the laws of Australia, (b) Broadbean Technology Limited, a limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, (c) Broadbean, Inc., a Delaware corporation and (d) CareerBuilder France S.A.R.L., a limited liability company organized (société à responsabilité limitée) under the laws of France, and (ii) certain assets and liabilities related thereto (the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) together, “Broadbean”) on June 13, 2023.\n\nRecent Business Highlights\n\nSigned 19 Public Safety & Government customers in the first quarter, which includes three new Federal customers, including a primary state law enforcement agency, intending to use Veritone Redact to automate audio and video redaction workflows, aimed at reducing lengthy manual processes, and addressing their Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request backlog.\n\nAnnounced the launch of Veritone’s AI consulting and services group to address customer and market-driven needs for increased AI enterprise-level services.\n\nVeritone continued its strong advertising momentum, with annual agency bookings growth year over year and signed several new customers, including the largest direct-to-consumer, pet supplies company, Chewy.\n\nSigned over 20 new Media & Entertainment deals in the first quarter, including new deals with Summit Media, the U.S. Soccer Federation, and NBC Universal, and renewals with key customers including Beasley Media Group, Crawford Broadcasting, and Augusta National and upsells with Golf Magazine and Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\nAnnounced a partnership with Grabyo, a leading cloud video platform for live broadcasting, live clipping, and distribution, to streamline live digital content production and leverage AI-driven content management and monetization tools to meet the evolving needs of sports organizations in today’s fast-paced digital landscape.\n\nAchieved AWS Advanced Tier Services status, advancing our AWS Partner capabilities, further accelerating partner driven revenue opportunities, and empowering Veritone to expand and deploy innovative AI solutions.\n\nNamed NAB Product of the Year for the 5th straight year for its recently launched Ask Veri solution, a new Generative AI media intelligence and natural language tool.\n\nReleased feature enhancements to its Advertising and Content Intelligence Suite designed to embrace data privacy while helping to safeguard ad revenues.\n\nQ1 restructuring of organization resulted in over $13.0 million in forecasted annualized cost savings, accelerating non-GAAP net income to as early as Q4 2024.\n\nFinancial Results for Three Months Ended March 31, 2024\n\nDelivered first quarter revenue of $31.6 million, an increase of $1.3 million or 4.3% from $30.3 million in the first quarter of 2023. Software Products & Services revenue of $15.2 million increased $1.1 million or 7.8% year over year driven by the Q2 2023 acquisition of Broadbean, which generated $8.5 million in revenue in Q1 2024, offset by the decline in legacy Veritone Hire revenue over the same period, including Amazon. Managed Services revenue was relatively flat year over year, increasing by $0.3 million, or 1.7%, to $16.4 million.\n\nLoss from operations was $21.8 million as compared to a loss of $23.6 million in Q1 2023 driven in part by a net $2.5 million decrease in operating expense including the impact of the Q2 2023 Broadbean Acquisition, a $1.1 million increase in non-GAAP gross profit driven by higher revenue, and a $0.7 million decline in non-cash depreciation, amortization, and stock based compensation, offset by a $2.5 million increase in severance and transition costs. Non-GAAP gross margin of 77.7% was relatively flat compared to the first quarter of 2023. GAAP net loss was $25.2 million, compared to GAAP net loss of $23.0 million in the first quarter of 2023, driven by an increase of $3.2 million in net interest expense associated with the Company’s December 2023 term loan, which included $1.3 million of non-cash amortization associated with the initial discount and issuance costs of the debt, offset by the $1.8 million decrease in loss from operations. Non-GAAP net loss of $7.6 million decreased by over 20% when compared to non-GAAP net loss of $9.6 million in the first quarter of 2023, largely driven by the increase in non-GAAP gross profit, coupled with reductions in our cost structure since the first quarter of 2023.\n\nDuring Q1 2024, Total Software Product & Services Customers of 3,384 was down 11% year over year on a Pro Forma basis principally due to reductions in legacy Career Builder customers transitioned off our Hire platform following our acquisition of Broadbean. Total New Bookings on a Pro Forma basis decreased by 43.1% to $13.0 million versus the comparable period a year ago largely driven by a reduction in revenue from consumption-based customers, including Amazon. Annual Recurring Revenue on a Pro Forma basis of $72.1 million decreased 36% year over year driven in large part by the decline in consumption spending from customers, offset by 7% year over year increase in subscription-based customers. Excluding the decline in consumption-based spending from Amazon, Software Products & Services revenue growth would have increased over 75% year over year.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $90.7 million, including approximately $73.3 million of cash received from Managed Services clients for future payments to vendors.\n\nBusiness Outlook\n\nSecond Quarter 2024\n\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $31.0 million to $32.0 million, as compared to $30.0 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $5.5 million to $6.5 million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $13.0 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nFull Year 2024\n\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $136.0 million to $142.0 million, as compared to $127.6 million for fiscal 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $11.0 million to $15.0 million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $37.5 million for fiscal 2023.\n\nThese updated financial guidance ranges supersede any previously disclosed financial guidance and investors should not rely on any previously disclosed financial guidance.\n\nConference Call\n\nVeritone will hold a conference call to deliver management’s prepared remarks on Tuesday, May 7, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its first quarter 2024 results, provide an update on the business and conduct a question-and-answer session.

The Company has posted additional supplemental financial information on its website at investors.veritone.com concurrently with this press release.\n\nPro Forma Software Revenue represents Software Products & Services revenue on a Pro Forma basis. Non-GAAP gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as Non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, respectively, is the Company’s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, adjusted to exclude provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of warrant liability, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, interest income, interest expense, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition and due diligence costs, gain on sale of energy group, contribution of business held for sale, variable consultant performance bonus expense, and severance and executive transition costs. The items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a breakdown of GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and these excluded items between the Company’s Core Operations and Corporate, are detailed in the reconciliations included following the financial statements attached to this news release. In addition, following the financial statements attached to this news release, the Company has provided additional supplemental non-GAAP measures of operating expenses, loss from operations, other income (expense), net, and loss before income taxes, excluding the items excluded from non-GAAP net loss as noted above, and reconciling such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\nThe Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures and KPIs because management believes such information to be important supplemental measures of performance that are commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. Management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other financial measures so calculated and presented, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Other companies (including the Company’s competitors) may define these non-GAAP financial measures differently. The non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the historical operating results of Veritone or predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn addition, the Company defines the following capitalized terms in this news release as follows:\n\nCore Operations consists of the Company’s aiWARE operating platform of software, SaaS and related services; content licensing and advertising agency services; and their supporting operations, including direct costs of sales as well as operating expenses for sales, marketing and product development and certain general and administrative costs dedicated to these operations.\n\nCorporate principally consists of general and administrative functions such as executive, finance, legal, people operations, fixed overhead expenses (including facilities and information technology expenses), other income (expenses) and taxes, and other expenses that support the entire Company, including public company driven costs.\n\nSoftware Products & Services consists of revenues generated from commercial enterprise and government and regulated industries customers using our aiWARE platform and Hiring Solutions, any related support and maintenance services, and any related professional services associated with the deployment and/or implementation of such solutions.\n\nManaged Services consist of revenues generated from commercial enterprise customers using our content licensing services and advertising agency and related services.\n\nAbout Veritone\n\nVeritone (NASDAQ: VERI) designs human-centered AI solutions.

As such, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement as a result of various factors. Important factors that could cause such differences include, among other things, our ability to expand our aiWARE SaaS business; declines or limited growth in the market for AI-based software applications and concerns over the use of AI that may hinder the adoption of AI technologies; our requirements for additional capital to support our business growth and the availability of such capital on acceptable terms, if at all; our reliance upon a limited number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue, including declines in key customers’ usage of our products and other offerings, our ability to realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions and divestitures, including our ability to successfully integrate our recent acquisition of Broadbean; our identification of existing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; fluctuations in our results over time; the impact of seasonality on our business; our ability to manage our growth, including through acquisitions and our further expansion into international markets; our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance and keep pace with technological developments; actions by our competitors, partners and others that may block us from using the third party technologies in our aiWARE platform, offering it for free to the public or making it cost prohibitive to continue to incorporate such technologies into our platform; interruptions, performance problems or security issues with our technology and infrastructure, or that of our third party service providers; the impact of the continuing economic disruption caused by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the war in Israel, financial instability, inflation rates and the responses by central banking authorities to control inflation, monetary supply shifts and the threat of recession in the United States and around the world on our business operations and those of our existing and potential customers; and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control.

(NASDAQ: VERI), a leader in designing human-centered AI solutions, and OPEXUS, a leading provider of government process management software, today announced that a major national bank in Canada is leveraging the OPEXUS ATIPXpress® AI Assist Module, which now includes Veritone’s award-winning Redact solution.\n\nVeritone Redact uses pre-processing and machine learning to support the AI Assist Module by finding, flagging and redacting sensitive information in audio and video data, which may include audio calls between customer service representatives and customers, internal company video conversations or on-premise surveillance footage. Redaction plays an important role in the bank’s efforts to maintain data security, regulatory compliance and trust in financial services. Redacting multimedia files is a time-intensive process, and Veritone Redact is able to help ATIP teams reduce redaction times by up to 90%, helping speed the ATIP request process and meet public demands more quickly.\n\n“Redaction plays a crucial role in many sectors, including government finance, given the importance of complying with Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) regulations; but manual redaction carries the weight of being time-consuming, error-prone and costly, often lacking the scalability and auditability crucial for large-scale document management,” said Howard Langsam, chief executive officer, OPEXUS. “Fortunately, through our AI Assist module and Veritone Redact, we provide an AI-powered redaction solution capable of effectively handling an uptick in audio and video ATIP requests.”\n\n“As the waves of audio and video data surge, AI-powered redaction is an indispensable tool for modern organizations, offering efficiency and accuracy in safeguarding sensitive information,” said Jon Gacek, general manager for Veritone Public Sector. “By integrating Veritone Redact into their AI Assist module, OPEXUS empowers their customers to effectively navigate the rising tide of ATIP requests, while also improving their ATIP workflows to help save time, money and resources.”\n\nBuilt on Veritone’s proven aiWARETM enterprise platform, Veritone Redact enables users to manually define sensitive imagery and objects, including heads and personally identifiable information, and then automatically redacts this information from audio and video documents. It also enables searches for keywords and phrases captured within the recorded audio and quick redaction of those items. To learn more visit: https://www.veritone.com/applications/redact/\n\nThe news follows OPEXUS’ recent contract renewal with the federal financial institution, whereby the bank will utilize OPEXUS’ expanded performance ATIP modules including AI Assist, Collaboration Portal, Public Access Link and Electronic Document Review. Given the increase in ATIP requests over the last several years, banks across Canada are seeing the need to modernize their ATIP process. OPEXUS’ expanded performance modules give them and other public agencies the tools they need to fully mature their ATIP programs while modernizing, streamlining and managing complex requests at scale.

(NASDAQ: VERI), a leader in designing human-centered AI solutions, today launched its new Intelligent Digital Evidence Management System (“iDEMS”) which leverages AI to modernize existing digital evidence management systems. iDEMS helps public safety and judicial agencies extract valuable data and insights to solve investigations more efficiently by automating workflows from data silos into a secure, centralized AI-driven system that significantly improves upon legacy evidentiary software.\n\nBuilt on Veritone’s award-winning aiWARE™ platform and hosted on Amazon Web Services’ (“AWS”) Criminal Justice Information System (“CIJS”)-compliant environment, iDEMS is a cloud-based platform comprised of Veritone’s market-leading public sector solutions – Veritone Investigate, Redact, Illuminate, Tracker and IDentify. iDEMS has seamless downstream workflows to centralize digital evidence, streamline redaction, improve analysis and evidence discovery, track persons of interest across all containerized content files and identify persons of interest from an existing records database. The solution also provides technical workflow integrations with many of the industry’s leading software platforms and tools, including:\n\nFreedom Of Information Act (“FOIA”) providers such as Granicus and Opexus;\n\nVideo management systems like Milestone and Qognify;\n\ne-discovery platforms such as Relativity;\n\nInvestigations and forensics providers such as Exterro and Nuix; and\n\nAny open APIs offered by other law enforcement solutions providers such as Axon’s Evidence.com and Cellebrite\n\n“Veritone iDEMS equips public safety and judicial agencies with extensive AI capabilities, offering a centralized repository with AI-enabled software applications to address the formidable challenge posed by vast and growing volumes of digital evidence that agency personnel need to review,” said Jon Gacek, general manager for Veritone Public Sector. “With iDEMS, agencies can ingest all digital evidence data, including audio, video and documents, from their existing systems, organize it and share it securely inside and outside their organization. Veritone’s AI-enabled technology swiftly and accurately identifies crucial evidence that can be efficiently reviewed and processed by agency personnel to accelerate investigations.”\n\nVeritone iDEMS comes at a time of rapid market growth for digital evidence management systems. The Gartner® Market Guide for Digital Evidence Management Systems (published January 30, 2024) notes that “reports estimate the global market size to exceed $12 billion by 2028 with compound annual growth rates at 10% or more.”*\n\nAt the heart of iDEMS is Veritone Investigate, which provides a customizable user interface and serves as the central evidence hub to store, manage, analyze and share all digital evidence files. Investigate connects to any cloud or on-premise data source, such as 911 and video management systems, and ingests any type of media files, including body-worn camera footage, surveillance footage and jailhouse calls. Investigators can leverage primary and advanced AI models to catalog and tag unstructured data within audio, video and PDF evidence files, leading to actionable insights. Investigate automatically runs and processes primary AI models such as transcription, object detection, facial detection and scene detection to help agencies search, discover and catalog the fundamental information needed to accelerate investigations.\n\nRyan Steelberg, president and chief executive officer of Veritone added, “The public sector increasingly considers AI a necessary and mission-critical tool, especially as agencies face the exponential risk of increased unstructured data, coupled with the challenges of constantly fluctuating or shrinking budgets. Veritone iDEMS was built on strict policies and secure architecture to uphold and support the highest levels of security and compliance. With our AI for Good principles, embedded within iDEMS, Veritone aims to set the standard in ethical development, implementation and use of AI in the public sector and all markets we serve.”\n\nVeritone Investigate is available for procurement directly from Veritone and through multiple channels and partners, and it is the first application in the iDEMS suite that is now available in the AWS Marketplace.\n\nTo learn more about Veritone iDEMS, please visit: https://www.veritone.com/solutions/intelligent-digital-evidence-management\n\n*GARTNER is a registered trademark and service mark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates in the U.S. and internationally and is used herein with permission.

(Nasdaq: VERI) (“the Company”), a leader in designing human-centered AI solutions, today reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n“I am pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter, and extremely excited about our prospects for 2024. For the balance of the past year, we executed and progressed against the strategic initiatives we set in motion at the beginning of 2023, continuing through the first quarter of 2024, which have resulted in a series of transformative actions, including the execution of significant cost reductions and the realignment of our organization. More importantly, we believe we now have the appropriate talent and investment to meet the current demands of our customers and partners, and to secure our growth in delivering advanced, efficient AI solutions to our customers in the years to come. These actions, coupled with our large and diverse customer base, high gross margins and industry leading AI software and solutions, set Veritone on the path to accelerating profitability into the second half of 2024,” said Ryan Steelberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Veritone. “Looking to the year ahead, I am confident that our aiWARE-powered solutions, expertise in the core market verticals we serve and renewed sense of focus will position us to be stronger, more competitive and better aligned to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the dynamic AI market for years to come.”\n\nFull Year 2023 Financial Highlights\n\nRevenue of $127.6 million, a decrease of $22.2 million or 14.8% year over year.\n\nLoss from operations of $92.3 million, an increase of $54.3 million year over year.\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit of $99.3 million, a decrease of $23.0 million or 18.8% year over year.\n\nNet loss of $58.6 million, an increase of $33.0 million year over year on a GAAP basis.\n\nNon-GAAP Net Loss of $37.3 million, as compared to Non-GAAP Net Loss of $15.9 million in fiscal year 2022.\n\nCash and cash equivalents(1) were $79.4 million as of December 31, 2023, as compared to $184.4 million as of December 31, 2022.\n\nFourth Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights\n\nCalculated on a Pro Forma basis; for additional information on these calculations, see “Note Regarding Pro Forma Information” and the definitions provided for each metric cited.\n\nRevenue of $34.2 million, a decrease of 22.1%, compared to Q4 2022.\n\nSoftware Products and Services revenues of $19.8 million, a decrease of 27.2% compared to Q4 2022.\n\nManaged Services revenue of $14.4 million, a decrease of 13.8% compared to Q4 2022.\n\nTotal Software Products & Services Customers(1) of 3,460, down slightly year over year.\n\nTotal New Bookings(2) of $17.5 million, down from $26.3 million in Q4 2022.\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (ARR)(2) of $82.1 million, down from $118.0 in Q4 2022 driven by declines in consumption-based revenue from our largest customer, offset by increases from recurring subscription-based revenue customers.\n\nLoss from Operations of $17.5 million, as compared to a loss of $10.0 million in Q4 2022.\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit of $27.7 million, a decrease of $9.5 million compared to Q4 2022.\n\nNet Income of $12.2 million, as compared to Net Income of $5.0 million in Q4 2022 driven by gains from repurchases of our November 2026 convertible notes at discounts in Q4 of 2023 and 2022.\n\nNon-GAAP Net Loss of $6.8 million, as compared to Non-GAAP Net Income of $2.2 million in Q4 2022.\n\n(1) Including approximately $45.3 million of cash received from Managed Services clients for future payments to vendors.\n\n(2) Calculated on a Pro Forma basis; for additional information on these calculations, see “Note Regarding Pro Forma Information” and the definitions provided for each metric cited.\n\nNote Regarding Pro Forma Information\n\n\"Pro Forma” information provided in this press release represents the historical information of Veritone combined with the historical information of Broadbean (as defined below) for the applicable period on a pro forma basis as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of (i) all of the issued and outstanding share capital of (a) Broadbean Technology Pty Ltd ACN 116 011 959 / ABN 79 116 011 959, a limited company incorporated under the laws of Australia, (b) Broadbean Technology Limited, a limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, (c) Broadbean, Inc., a Delaware corporation and (d) CareerBuilder France S.A.R.L., a limited liability company organized (société à responsabilité limitée) under the laws of France, and (ii) certain assets and liabilities related thereto (the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) together, “Broadbean”) on June 13, 2023.\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nDecember 31,\n\nYear Ended\n\nDecember 31,\n\nUnaudited\n\n(in $000s, except customers)\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\nPercent\n\nChange\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\nPercent\n\nChange\n\nRevenue\n\n$34, 197\n\n$43,890\n\n(22%)\n\n$127,560\n\n$149,728\n\n(15%)\n\nLoss from Operations\n\n$(17,505)\n\n$(9,951)\n\n76%\n\n$(92,336)\n\n$(37,995)\n\nNM\n\nNet Income (Loss)\n\n$12,175\n\n$5,032\n\nNM\n\n$(58,625)\n\n$(25,557)\n\nNM\n\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit*\n\n$27,702\n\n$37,183\n\n(25%)\n\n$99,304\n\n$122,296\n\n(19%)\n\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss) *\n\n$(6,808)\n\n$2,190\n\nNM\n\n$(37,331)\n\n$(15,880)\n\nNM\n\nSoftware Products & Services\n\n(in $000s, except customers)\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nDecember 31,\n\nYear Ended\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\nPercent\n\nChange\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\nPercent\n\nChange\n\nPro Forma Software Revenue (1)\n\n$19,824\n\n$35,612\n\n(44%)\n\n$83,468\n\n$117,814\n\n(29%)\n\nTotal Software Products & Services Customers(2)\n\n3,460\n\n3,824\n\n(10%)\n\nAverage Annual Revenue (AAR)(3)\n\n$82,128\n\n$118,002\n\n(30%)\n\nTotal New Bookings(4)\n\n$17,457\n\n$26,342\n\n(33%)\n\nGross Retention(5)\n\n>90%\n\n>90%\n\nNM = Not Meaningful\n\n(1)“Pro Forma Software Revenue” is a non-GAAP measure that represents Software Products & Services revenue on a Pro Forma basis.\n\n(2)“Total Software Products & Services Customers” includes Pro Forma Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each respective quarter set forth above with net revenues in excess of $10 and also excludes any customers categorized by us as trial or pilot status. In prior periods, we provided “Ending Software Customers,” which represented Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each fiscal quarter with trailing twelve-month revenues in excess of $2,400 for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. and/or deemed by Veritone to be under an active contract for the applicable periods. Total Software Products & Services Customers is not comparable to Ending Software Customers. Total Software Products & Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve month basis and excludes any customers that are on trial or pilot status with us rather than including customers with active contracts. Management uses Total Software Products & Services Customers and we believe Total Software Products & Services Customers are useful to investors because it more accurately reflects our total customers for our Software Products & Services inclusive of Broadbean.\n\n(3) “Annual Recurring Revenue” is calculated as Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), which is an annualized calculation of the monthly recurring revenue in the last month of the calculated quarter for all active Software Products & Services customers, combined with Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), which is the trailing twelve month calculation of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Software Products & Services customers. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Pro Forma Annual Recurring Revenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue is on a Pro Forma basis, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenues.\n\n(4)“Total New Bookings” represents the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts received in the quarter (including fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term), excluding any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services), in each case on a Pro Forma basis.\n\n(5) “Gross Revenue Retention” represents our dollar-based gross retention rate as of the period end by starting with the revenue from Software Products & Services Customers as of the 3 months in the prior year quarter to such period, or Prior Year Quarter Revenue. We then deduct from the Prior Year Quarter Revenue any revenue from Software Products & Services Customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue. We then divide the total Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue by the total Prior Year Quarter Revenue to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of revenue from all Software Products & Services Customers from our Software Products & Services as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn. All numbers used to determine Gross Revenue Retention are calculated on a Pro Forma basis.\n\nRecent Business Highlights\n\nVeritone became a contributing company to the newly launched Generative AI Center of Excellence (CoE) for Amazon Web Services (AWS) Partners in the AWS Partner Network (APN). As an AWS Partner, Veritone will contribute its generative AI expertise and AI for Good principles to the program’s mission.\n\niHeart, the number one audio company in America, extended its licensing agreement for both Discovery and Attribute. iHeart has utilized Veritone’s technology to provide a differentiated service to its customers and advertisers since 2017.\n\nVeritone launched its new Intelligent Digital Evidence Management Systems (“iDEMS”), one of the industry’s first cloud-based digital evidence management solutions that integrates AI to help public safety and judicial agencies accelerate investigations. iDEMS combines Veritone’s market-leading solutions for state and local law enforcement agencies – including Investigate, which is now available in the AWS marketplace – to form a centralized repository with AI-enabled applications that automate workflows and extract valuable data and insights, significantly improving upon legacy evidentiary software.\n\nCommenced the initial phase of two separate custom implementations of Veritone’s iDEMS solutions with US Federal Government Agencies (DoJ and DoD) to materially reduce the time and cost associated with the organization, review and analysis of video content and evidence.\n\nExpanded and extended our license agreement with the California Highway Patrol (CHP) for Veritone Redact unlimited licenses, to significantly reduce the cost and time associated with providing audio and video content to third parties while protecting identities and personal identifiable information.\n\nAnnounced a technology partnership with Dalet, a leading technology and service provider for media-rich organizations, enabling a seamless workflow from content creation through production, creation, packaging and distribution, empowering media, sports and entertainment customers to monetize their digital media archives.\n\nAnnounced restructuring of organization in Q1 2024, resulting in forecasted annualized savings of 15% of operating expenses, accelerating projected near-term cash flow profitability to as early as Q4 2024.\n\nEntered into a four-year $77.5 million senior secured Term Loan in December 2023, using $37.5 million of the proceeds to repurchase $50.0 million principal amount of Veritone’s convertible senior notes due 2026 at a purchase price of $37.5 million plus accrued and unpaid interest through the closing date to pay fees and out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the Term Loan. Veritone expects to use the remaining net proceeds of the Term Loan for general corporate purposes.\n\nFinancial Results for Three Months Ended December 31, 2023\n\nDelivered fourth quarter revenue of $34.2 million, a decrease of $9.7 million or 22.1% from $43.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Software Products & Services revenue of $19.8 million declined $7.4 million or 27.2% year over year driven by a decline of $5.5 million in certain one-time, non-recurring revenue in Q4 2022 as compared to Q4 2023, coupled with a net decline of $1.9 million from our Veritone Hire solutions offset by a 30% year over year improvement in GRI. Managed Services revenue decreased by $2.3 million, or 13.8%, to $14.4 million, driven by lower advertising revenue and spend. Loss from operations was $17.5 million as compared to a loss of $10.0 million in Q4 2022 driven in part by the corresponding decline in revenue partially offset by various cost reductions enacted in 2023. Non-GAAP gross profit of $27.7 million in Q4 2023 declined by $9.5 million year over year largely due to the decrease in revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin of 81.3% as compared to 84.7% in 2022 driven by the mix of revenue year over year.\n\nGAAP net income was $12.2 million, compared to $5.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven in part by non-recurring gains of $30.0 million and $19.1 million associated with the repurchases of $50.0 million and $60.0 million of our convertible senior notes due 2026 in Q4 2023 and Q4 2022, respectively, offset by the increase in loss from operations and changes in the income tax provision over the same periods. Non-GAAP net loss was $6.8 million compared to non-GAAP net income of $2.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, largely driven by the decline in non-GAAP gross margin, offset by net improvements in our cost structure throughout fiscal 2023.\n\nDuring Q4 2023, Total Software Product & Services Customers of 3,460 was down slightly year over year on a Pro Forma basis principally due to ongoing run-off of legacy Career Builder customers transitioning off as a result of Veritone’s Q2 2023 acquisition of Broadbean. Total New Bookings on a Pro Forma basis decreased by 33.7% to $17.5 million versus the comparable period a year ago largely driven by a reduction in spend from Amazon. Annual Recurring Revenue on a Pro Forma basis decreased 30.4% year over year to $82.1 million driven in large part by the decline in consumption revenue from larger customers, including Amazon, over the trailing twelve months ended Q4 2023 as compared to Q4 2022. Excluding the declines in one-time revenue and from Amazon, Software Products & Services revenue growth would have been 64% year over year.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $79.4 million, including approximately $45.3 million of cash received from Managed Services clients for future payments to vendors.\n\nFinancial Results Full Year Ended December 31, 2023\n\nDelivered fiscal year 2023 revenue of $127.6 million, a decrease of $22.2 million or 14.8% year over year. Software Products & Services revenue was $68.4 million, a decrease of $16.2 million or 19.1% year over year as a result of lower consumption across our Veritone Hire customer base, offset by the addition of Broadbean in Q2 2023, and the decline of certain non-recurring, one-time software revenue in 2023 versus 2022. Managed Services revenue decreased by $6.0 million, or 9.2%, to $59.2 million, driven by lower advertising revenue and spend. Excluding the declines in certain one-time revenue and from Amazon, Software Products & Services revenue growth would have 44% year over year.\n\nLoss from operations was $92.3 million as compared to a loss of $38.0 million in 2022 driven in part by a benefit of $22.7 million in 2022 associated with a revaluation of certain contingent consideration, coupled with the decline in non-GAAP gross profit and increases in certain non-recurring diligence costs and severance expenses. Non-GAAP gross profit of $99.3 million declined by $23.0 million year over year consistent with the revenue decline over the same period. Non-GAAP gross margin of 77.8% as compared to 81.7% in 2022 driven in large part by the mix of revenue in 2023 as compared to 2022.\n\nNet loss was $58.6 million, compared to $25.2 million for fiscal year 2022, driven in part by the increase in loss from operations offset by the previously discussed gains on debt extinguishments of $30.0 million and $19.1 million in Q4 2023 and 2023, respectively, improvements in interest income year over year and the changes in the income tax provision over the same periods. Non-GAAP net loss was $37.3 million compared to $15.9 million in 2022, largely driven by the decline non-GAAP gross margin and the net impact of various cost reductions made in fiscal 2023 offset by the acquisition of Broadbean operating expenses in Q2 2023.\n\nBusiness Outlook\n\nFirst Quarter 2024\n\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $30.5 million to $31.5 million, as compared to $30.3 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $7.0 million to $8.0 million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $9.6 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nFull Year 2024\n\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $134.0 million to $142.0 million, as compared to $127.6 million for fiscal 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $11.0 million to $15.0 million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $37.5 million for fiscal 2023.\n\nThese updated financial guidance ranges supersede any previously disclosed financial guidance and investors should not rely on any previously disclosed financial guidance.\n\nConference Call\n\nVeritone will hold a conference call to deliver management’s prepared remarks on Tuesday, March 12, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, provide an update on the business and conduct a question-and-answer session.

The Company also provides certain key performance indicators (KPIs), including Total Software Products & Services Customers, Annual Recurring Revenue, Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), Total New Bookings and Gross Revenue Retention. The Company has posted additional supplemental financial information on its website at investors.veritone.com concurrently with this press release.\n\nPro Forma Software Revenue represents Software Products & Services revenue on a Pro Forma basis. Non-GAAP gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as Non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share is the Company’s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, adjusted to exclude provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of warrant liability, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, interest income, interest expense, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition and due diligence costs, gain on sale of energy group, contribution of business held for sale, variable consultant performance bonus expense, and severance and executive transition costs. The items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a breakdown of GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and these excluded items between the Company’s Core Operations and Corporate, are detailed in the reconciliations included following the financial statements attached to this news release. In addition, following the financial statements attached to this news release, the Company has provided additional supplemental non-GAAP measures of operating expenses, loss from operations, other income (expense), net, and loss before income taxes, excluding the items excluded from non-GAAP net loss as noted above, and reconciling such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\nThe Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures and KPIs because management believes such information to be important supplemental measures of performance that are commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. Management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other financial measures so calculated and presented, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.

In addition, words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “should,” “could,” “estimate” or “continue” or the plural, negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements, and any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and are based on management’s current assumptions, expectations, beliefs and information. As such, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement as a result of various factors. Important factors that could cause such differences include, among other things, our ability to expand our aiWARE SaaS business; declines or limited growth in the market for AI-based software applications and concerns over the use of AI that may hinder the adoption of AI technologies; our requirements for additional capital to support our business growth and the availability of such capital on acceptable terms, if at all; our reliance upon a limited number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue, including declines in key customers’ usage of our products and other offerings, our ability to realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions and divestitures, including our ability to successfully integrate our recent acquisition of Broadbean; our identification of existing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; fluctuations in our results over time; the impact of seasonality on our business; our ability to manage our growth, including through acquisitions and our further expansion into international markets; our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance and keep pace with technological developments; actions by our competitors, partners and others that may block us from using the third party technologies in our aiWARE platform, offering it for free to the public or making it cost prohibitive to continue to incorporate such technologies into our platform; interruptions, performance problems or security issues with our technology and infrastructure, or that of our third party service providers; the impact of the continuing economic disruption caused by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the war in Israel, financial instability, inflation rates and the responses by central banking authorities to control inflation, monetary supply shifts and the threat of recession in the United States and around the world on our business operations and those of our existing and potential customers; and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control.

In prior periods, we provided “Ending Software Customers,” which represented Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each fiscal quarter with trailing twelve-month revenues in excess of $2,400 for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. and/or deemed by the Company to be under an active contract for the applicable periods. Total Software Products & Services Customers is not comparable to Ending Software Customers. Total Software Products & Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve-month basis. Total Software Products & Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve-month basis and excludes any customers that are on trial or pilot status with us rather than including customers with active contracts. Management uses Total Software Products & Services Customers and we believe Total Software Products & Services Customers are useful to investors because it more accurately reflects our total customers for our Software Products & Services customers inclusive of Broadbean.\n\n(4) “Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)” represents an annualized calculation of monthly recurring revenue during the last month of the applicable quarter for all Total Software Products & Services customers, in each case on a Pro Forma basis. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue (SaaS). Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) includes only subscription-based SaaS revenue, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and more volatile Consumption revenues.\n\n(5) “Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption)” represents the trailing twelve months of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Total Software Products & Services customers, in each case, on a Pro Forma basis. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) includes only non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption)” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and more volatile Consumption revenues.\n\n(6) “Total New Bookings” represents the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts received in the quarter (including fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term), excluding any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services), in each case on a Pro Forma basis.\n\n(7) “Gross Revenue Retention” represents calculate our dollar-based gross revenue retention rate as of the period end by starting with the revenue from Software Products & Services Customers as of the 3 months in the prior year quarter to such period, or Prior Year Quarter Revenue. We then deduct from the Prior Year Quarter Revenue any revenue from Software Products & Services Customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue. We then divide the total Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue by the total Prior Year Quarter Revenue to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of revenue from all Software Products & Services Customers from our Software Products & Services as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn. All numbers used to determine Gross Revenue Retention are calculated on a Pro Forma basis.\n\nManaged Services Supplemental Financial Information\n\nThe following table sets forth the results for each of the key performance indicators for Managed Services.\n\n(1) Avg billings per active Managed Services customer for each quarter reflects the average quarterly billings per active Managed Services customer over the twelve-month period through the end of such quarter for Managed Services clients that are active during such quarter.\n\n(2) Managed Services revenue and metrics exclude content licensing and media services.\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nDecember 31,\n\nYear Ended\n\nDecember 31,\n\nUnaudited\n\nPercent\n\nPercent\n\n(in $000s)\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\nChange\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\nChange\n\nRevenue\n\n$34,197\n\n$43,890\n\n(22)%\n\n$127,560\n\n$149,728\n\n(15)%\n\nLoss from operations\n\n$(17,505)\n\n$(9,951)\n\n76%\n\n$(92,336)\n\n$(37,995)\n\n143%\n\nNet income (loss)\n\n$12,175\n\n$5,032\n\n142%\n\n$(58,625)\n\n$(25,557)\n\n129%\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit(1)\n\n$27,702\n\n$37,183\n\n(25)%\n\n$99,304\n\n$122,296\n\n(19)%\n\nNon-GAAP net income (loss)(1)\n\n$(6,808)\n\n$2,190\n\n(411)%\n\n$(37,331)\n\n$(15,880)\n\n135%\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nDecember 31,\n\nYear Ended\n\nDecember 31,\n\nSoftware Products & Services\n\nPercent\n\nPercent\n\n(in $000s, except customers)\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\nChange\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\nChange\n\nPro Forma Software Revenue\n\n$19,824\n\n$35,612\n\n(44)%\n\n$83,468\n\n$117,184\n\n(29)%\n\nTotal Software Products & Services Customers\n\n3,460\n\n3,824\n\n(10)%\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue\n\n$82,128\n\n$118,002\n\n(30)%\n\nTotal New Bookings\n\n$17,457\n\n$26,342\n\n(33)%\n\nGross Retention\n\n>90%\n\n>90%\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240312722387/en/\n\nCompany Contact:\n\nMike Zemetra\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nVeritone, Inc.\n\ninvestors@veritone.com\n\nIR Agency Contact:\n\nStefan Norbom\n\nProsek Partners\n\n203-644-5475\n\nsnorbom@prosek.com\n\nSource: Veritone, Inc.",

      "# [Truth In The Signal: Veritone Shepherds New Epoch Of Enterprise Empowerment by Zenger News on 2024-04-16](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zengernews/2024/04/16/truth-in-the-signal-veritone-shepherds-epoch-enterprise-empowerment/)\nBy: Christos Makridis\n\n\"It’s a brother’s story in many ways,\" begins Ryan Steelberg, CEO, president, and co-founder of Veritone, reflecting on his unexpected journey from a pre-med student at UCLA to a tech entrepreneur. “It’s those two classic roles you think of in tech startups; me primarily being the front line as the public-facing business leader, and Chad always the technology and product wizard.”\n\nSteelberg stands today as a pioneering force in the burgeoning field of AI software and services, primarily for enterprises and major customers like ESPN, CBS and the US government- but also attainable to mid-sized firms as well. His entry into the tech sphere was marked by a collaborative effort with his brother Chad, a partnership fueled by their shared curiosity and passion for technology, bolstered by steady encouragement from their parents along the way, growing up in Orange County, California. Their journey would ultimately redefine the contours of digital advertising, and eventually, establish key pillars of today’s enterprise AI solutions industry.\n\nThe brothers’ first formal internet outing was launching a first of its kind real estate platform in 1994 (akin to what we know today as online real estate listing services), similar to Zillow or Trulia. A big idea for sure, but what appealed most to VCs was the potential to monetize ads across its real estate sites. \"Within three months, we had signed contracts with multiple real estate brokerages, including Coldwell Banker, Edina Realty, and Century 21 Realty, generating high demand for advertising space,\" Steelberg recalls, highlighting the rapid success of their venture. This led to the duo's initial breakthrough with the establishment of AdForce, which became the world's largest centralized independent ad-serving and management solution. Under the Steelberg’s leadership, AdForce pioneered and grew their advanced advertising platform signing dozens of industry behemoths, including AOL and Yahoo, which ultimately lead to an acquisition by CMGI for more than $500 million after going public on Nasdaq in 1999. In 2000, AdForce won the Smithsonian Award for the Best Technology in IT.\n\nDespite a big splash right out of the gate, the Steelberg brothers’ entrepreneurial journey, however, was not without its share of challenges and setbacks. Their next venture in 1999, Winfire, Inc., faced formidable monopolistic obstacles amidst the rapid proliferation of broadband technology. Winfire aimed to provide free high-speed Internet access to broadband users and was established as a DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) service provider, offering an alternative to traditional high-priced paid Internet services. The company had tremendous initial interest, quickly amassing a major paid customer base; however, a breakdown occurred with Winfire’s partnered telecom companies’ ability, or willingness, to deliver timely service, as they instead chose to prioritize existing customers over Winfire’s. It ultimately led to the collapse of the firm, which only had a total lifespan of about a year. “A big early lesson in resilience and dealing with monopolies for two guys in their early twenties”, said Steelberg. “An experience that was definitely formative in seeing all sides of the coin not far out of the starting gate, and ultimately, looking back, it was painful, but there was serious learning there.”\n\nIn 2002, the Steelbergs co-founded dMarc, at the time, the largest centralized radio advertising network and digital automation company servicing more than 4,600 Radio Broadcasters. dMarc was acquired by Google in February 2006 for $102 million in cash, with revenue targets that pushed the deal upwards of $1.2B. As of January 2009, total payouts exceeded $400 million. In 2007, the brothers founded Brand Affinity Technologies, an influencer technology and marketing services company.\n\nIt was within the crucible of these early adtech-centric ventures, ripe with experimentation, that Ryan honed his skills in navigating the intricate terrain of data-intensive environments and making sense of non-linear content—a skill set that would prove priceless in the field of artificial intelligence, where large language models and engines must effectively analyze tremendous amounts of disparate information and extrapolate faces, logos, trends, patterns, which can then be actioned in myriad ways. Since the essence of adtech lies in the ability to harness vast troves of data and extract actionable insights to optimize advertising strategies, Steelberg’s skill set seamlessly translated into the domain of AI for enterprise.\n\nHuman-Centered AI: Redefining Industries\n\nVeritone, which means “truth in the signal,” was launched in 2014 where Steelberg would serve as president from 2015 to 2022 prior to becoming CEO. Again, they began with a core mission of addressing fundamental advertising problems, like the way audio data was ingested and analyzed. Quickly, Veritone's proprietary cloud-agnostic solution, aiWARETM—which can be thought of as an operating system which AI programs are built on—represented a quantum leap in the field, heralding a paradigm shift in the way enterprises interacted with data. Leveraging multiple AI engines in parallel, Veritone's platform offered novel accuracy in analyzing and interpreting audio data.\n\n“The problem we tackled emerged when things shifted from the desktop to your mobile phone,” said Steelberg of Veritone’s beginnings. “When you started to watch a video there was no place to serve an ad adjacent to the content anymore, so we became obsessed with trying to understand native-based advertising or product placement, embedded into the content. It could be the broadcast host for a sporting event talking about Geico during a timeout, it could be a logo of a Chevy truck in a Michael Bay movie, or it could be the Apple laptop on the coffee shop counter in a sitcom. It was this incredibly rich content opportunity where frankly people are most in tune and engaged, and we knew we could figure out a way to look at this more transactionally, meaning could we start to bring structure to linear unstructured audio and video and unlock a world of new possibilities. That was the initial idea,” he concluded. From there, this initial vision of ingesting and understanding unstructured data leveraging AI, would be the foundation for aiWARE and Veritone into the future.\n\nWth a focus on talent acquisition, media, entertainment, the public sector, and generative AI, Veritone carved a niche for itself, redefining how industries harness the power of AI to drive efficiency, enhance decision-making, and ultimately, maximize human potential. At the core of Veritone's ethos lies a deep commitment to human-centered AI solutions. Unlike traditional approaches that seek to replace human effort with automation, Veritone believes in augmenting human capabilities. With aiWARE, Veritone orchestrated a symphony of machine learning models, transforming raw data into actionable intelligence across a spectrum of industries, just as Steelberg had envisioned.\n\nIn the realm of talent acquisition, Veritone's solutions are reshaping the landscape. Veritone Hire seamlessly integrates global job distribution tools with programmatic advertising AI technology. By optimizing recruiting strategies, reducing costs, and improving efficiency, Veritone helps organizations attract diverse talent at scale, reaffirming their commitment to diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Its suite of solutions for talent acquisition cater to both centralized and decentralized recruitment needs and is built on job distribution software and technology specializing in programmatic advertising. Talent acquisition teams and staffing firms can automatically post job ads to job boards, search engines and social media channels all in one place with seamless integrations into over 100 Applicant Tracking System (ATS) partners and optimize individual ads or full campaigns with AI to maximize ROI by increasing candidate volume while reducing wasted ad spend. Veritone enables streamlining of the screening processes by leveraging conversational AI to engage and screen candidates post-apply, all within an ATS.\n\nVeritone's impact extends beyond corporate corridors into the realms of media, entertainment, sports, and broadcast. Their AI solutions empower content creators, advertisers, podcasters, and producers to unlock human potential. From metadata extraction to AI-powered digital asset management, Veritone is disrupting content creation and distribution, providing proof-of-performance metrics, and maximizing the value of every piece of content. Customers can gain value from video, audio, images, text and data through metadata extraction, and search and visualization, enhancing customer support and system integrations. Veritone holds that while generative AI is already used to create outlines, jumpstart content writing and develop ad copy, it will eventually provide an ability to create multilingual content at scale, helping brands test new regions with ad promos and other AI-generated assets and such as full prebuilt campaigns.\n\n“It is in the public sector where we see possibly the greatest growth opportunity in the near term,” said Steelberg. “Where efficiency and safety are paramount, Veritone's AI solutions are making a tangible difference,” he added. Through aiWARE, law enforcement agencies, government bodies, and public safety organizations streamline previously manual processes while gaining invaluable insights from vast amounts of data. Biometric identification means law enforcement agencies can authenticate users and identify callers and suspects by recognizing voices and faces in videos, images and calls. Redaction capabilities help departments save time and costs while freeing up valuable resources by using automating the exaction of sensitive information within audio, video and image-based evidence. Transcription and translation functions enable legal and contact center teams to automate manual work with near-real-time transcription and translation of any data source, while person-of-interest tracking tracks persons of interest across video files regardless of source without using personal identifiable information (PII).\n\nEthics and Responsibility: Guiding Principles\n\nVeritone remains at the forefront of innovation through the lens of its “AI For Good” motto. Through frequent collaboration with regulators, industry leaders, and stakeholders, Veritone is shaping the future of AI regulation, ensuring that technology evolves responsibly and ethically. With a keen eye on emerging trends and challenges, Veritone is committed to empowering industries to harness the full potential of AI for the betterment of society. “We have a big responsibility here to self-police in this industry in a way that we just haven’t seen in tech, and with the rapid evolution of AI and its profound potential, companies have to lead the charge here,” said Steelberg. “Social media platforms are still trying to play catch up and we see the friction there; it’s a great lesson in how our industry can and must stay ahead of the curve of where this is all going from a societal protection standpoint.”\n\nVeritone has specifically focused on transparency in the design of ethical AI. Their solutions are designed to be easily explainable, generating outputs that are reliable and understandable, in hopes this will build trust among users, stakeholders, and the broader community. Trust is further bolstered by the company's commitment to fairness and non-discrimination, as its systems are engineered to mitigate bias and uphold fairness in their outcomes. The company adheres to stringent security and compliance practices to safeguard data and complies with industry regulations and standards. But as a serial entrepreneur with a passion to empower other innovators, Steelberg is maybe most bullish on the democratization message:\n\n“Fundamentally, we are democratizing and advancing AI access and utilization for enterprises,” Steelberg said. “However, small businesses must also have the tools and opportunity to embrace AI. To avoid the next digital divide—one where I believe the stakes are even higher than ever—small businesses must embrace and educate themselves on AI. Thankfully we have solutions like Veritone’s aiWARE and other cost-effective platforms out there that ensure CEOs can start their AI journey cost-effectively and intelligently. This is a dynamic and ever-changing AI environment that we are living through, and Veritone will continue to build solutions to make AI more accessible and actionable for all enterprises. We see ourselves as ‘wilderness guides for AI’ in a digital world,” he concluded.",
