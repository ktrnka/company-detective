Is it worth the money? Do you find the switch allows you to do more with your set up without a million pedals/changing instruments?\n\nI have a Les Paul, Stratocaster, Sg and a McCarty PRS (the push pull pots on the McCarty are what's getting me interested in veritone switch) I am going to add a semi/hollow body guitar to my guitar collection and need some opinions. \n\n\nIn my search I fell in love with the Epiphone Lucille .The binding and hardware is beautiful and the guitar has got flash. Most of all, it's the SOUND on every review video that sets it apart for me.\n \nThis would be my first Epiphone purchase and it's a hefty price tag in comparison to other Epiphone instruments. \n\nThat's why I want to ask anyone who has experience with hollow body's because videos are designed to sell products.\n\nI have yet to play one, which could sink the boat if I hate the feel, but i wanted to ask y'all if you had any opinions on this instrument?  if you have a semi/hollow body that is your go to? Any opinions on Epiphone hollowbodys\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n## Comment ID kw9unjv with +5 score by [(obscured_by_turtles, Reddit, 2024-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kw9unjv/) (in reply to ID 1bm3skn):\nI've played a couple and been tempted, both the Epiphone and Gibson models.  The Lucille can be a bit heavier than a 335 type.\n\nThe Varitone has  uses but many players set it to the 'bypass' position.   It's mostly found on Gibson ES-345 and sometimes ES-355 models plus the Lucille.\n\nIt's more than a tone control, which just uses a capacitor to roll high frequencies off.  Varitones include an inductor or choke with capacitors to subtract some specific frequencies.\n\nNote that some of the classic guitars the Varitone was used on, also had the pickups out of phase.\n\nThis video has an explanation and demonstration using a Gibson ES-345:\n\n[https://youtu.be/hAHm7X8xmp4?si=2gnuLn5FGyd4pVp1](https://youtu.be/hAHm7X8xmp4?si=2gnuLn5FGyd4pVp1)\n\nAnd the lovely and talented Chris Buck demoing a varitone:\n\n[https://youtu.be/YENmNQh-SEA?si=uhmzGXPRxAbw7kTd](https://youtu.be/YENmNQh-SEA?si=uhmzGXPRxAbw7kTd)\n\nThe thread at this link includes a wiring diagram:\n\n[https://forum.gibson.com/topic/127119-varitone-wiring/](https://forum.gibson.com/topic/127119-varitone-wiring/)\n\nFor myself, the semi-hollow I used for some years is a 1973 Guild Starfire IV.   My last gig involved a 2003 Gretsch Anniversary, which is a wonderful guitar.   Have not gigged with my 335.\n\nMost of the time right now I have on hand a somewhat abused 61 reissue Epi Casino,  made in China but assembled in Nashville with US electronics.  Traded an Epi Wildkat that I never bonded with.   The Casino fell out of favour by the early-mid 1960's as stage volumes rose.  Being fully hollow, feedback is a real issue in that circumstance, but otherwise it's an excellent guitar.\n\n### Comment ID kwbv5yx with +2 score by [(mmfm1984, Reddit, 2024-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kwbv5yx/) (in reply to ID kw9unjv):\nThanks!!\n\n## Comment ID kw9bb4p with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kw9bb4p/) (in reply to ID 1bm3skn):\nI played one years ago and liked it. I cant remember the veritone switch, thats probably not something Id personally look. But 335 style guitars are some of my absolute favorites. They are super versatile, you can get grear blues, rock, jazz, country tones, the list goes on. Its got a short scale like a les paul but they're a lot easier on the back.\n\n## Comment ID kwad4am with +3 score by [(GibsonMaestro, Reddit, 2024-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kwad4am/) (in reply to ID 1bm3skn):\nI have an Epi Les Paul Florentine, which is a semi-hollow Les Paul. However, it comes PRObuckers, which I find more dynamic then the Alnico Classic PROs that come in the Lucille. However, it's a routed LP body, and is probably isn't a fair comparison. \n\nI also own a Squier CV Starcaster, which is built more closely to the specs of Lucille, and is very similar to the Lucille. Unplugged, it's loud. Plugged in, it's no different than a solid body, and you'll find the same with Lucille. \n\nA semi-hollow has the pickups installed directly into the center block, and is essentially a 2x4 electric guitar with hollow wings. Depending on the model, it could sound exactly like your LP.\n\nThe benefit of a semi-hollow is the light weight, not any specific \"hollow\" sound.\n\n## Comment ID kw9bkyx with +1 score by [(mmfm1984, Reddit, 2024-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kw9bkyx/) (in reply to ID 1bm3skn):\nThanks!

      "# Post ID mmdapt: B-Roll Organization, Metadata, and Simple Solutions - Am I looking for a unicorn? with +3 score by [(kellykellyyo, Reddit, 2021-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/mmdapt/broll_organization_metadata_and_simple_solutions/)\nI feel like I've scoured this sub and keep finding something close, but here I am making this post.\n\nBackground: I am a Photo/ Video Studio Operations Director. I am editing adjacent and have been most of my career. I get a bit of editing spilled on me, but in no way am I ever fully immersed. Please excuse any ignorance I may have on what I am posting. I have been tasked with finding a simple solution to the tale as old as time - asset retrieval on a budget. \n\nWhat I want to believe simply exists is a way to type \"New York Skyline\" into a search box and out pops my answer. The answer doesn't have to be the clip itself, but if it could give me the job name, that would be a huge step ahead. Even better would be the filename itself, but I don't need to push my luck. We do have a robust job naming system. Currently we rely on our memory of when we took footage of a particular thing.\n\nI know that metadata can be added to files (we can add descriptors to our process), but how do you search it? We use the host of Adobe products. So if you search in Premiere,  are you only searching the Premiere catalog (is catalog the right word?) that you have open or can it search across all catalogs?\n\nFrom your other helpful posts, I have a tab open for CatDV, Axle ai, and Kyno but fear that those have too many features and that I'm overlooking a more simple solution that is just not uncovered yet.\n\nThank you in advance for your time!\n\n## Comment ID gtqv9je with +7 score by [(avguru1, Reddit, 2021-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/mmdapt/broll_organization_metadata_and_simple_solutions/gtqv9je/) (in reply to ID mmdapt):\nYou need a common database that can index, quite literally - hundreds of file types. Images, video, audio, all in different formats. All of these formats can retain some inherent metadata, but not all of them, and most don't have subjective metadata - just objective technical metadata. NLEs are *not* a great way to do this, as you're then limiting searching of that content to that NLE searching ability...PLUS the limited metadata management that NLEs have.\n\nThis is why a DAM/MAM/PAM is the way to go. They are purpose-built to index as many files and file types and humanly possible PLUS allow user metadata input.\n\nAs you can imagine, DAM/MAM/PAM solutions have evolved past a \"search engine\". This means automation, interop with 3rd party tools, transcoding, etc.\n\nSo, while DAM/MAM/PAM solutions may have more bells and whistles...it's because tagging and searching has been done for decades...and nature abhors a vacuum. \n\nThe next evolution is using AI/ML to tag the things you haven't. Facial/sentiment/speech/object recognition. However, these tools are usually wrapped into higher-end solutions and/or require you to train the AI/ML. Plus, AI/ML is still usually cloud-based, which means you'll need to incur cloud costs.\n\nTL;DR: you're on the right path to find a suitable DAM/MAM/PAM. Don't rely on an NLE. Choose one that has a panel inside your NLE (Premiere).\n\nThis may give you more info:  https://5thingsseries.com/episode/asset-management/\n\n### Comment ID h3ut53c with +1 score by [(garbageplay, Reddit, 2021-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/mmdapt/broll_organization_metadata_and_simple_solutions/h3ut53c/) (in reply to ID gtqv9je):\nWhat AI/ML solutions are available? Seems google photos using a business license might do a lot of recognition for you, but the folder management is atrocious on there. \n\nI'm just a small youtuber, so something super expensive isn't really an option.\n\n#### Comment ID h3v1zge with +1 score by [(avguru1, Reddit, 2021-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/mmdapt/broll_organization_metadata_and_simple_solutions/h3v1zge/) (in reply to ID h3ut53c):\nNo, not really. As each cloud provider does AI/ML differently, you're often using services from different providers, then using an Asset Management system to filter it and make sense of it all for you, the creative.\n\nIf you decide to use 1 cloud provider, than can help, but they charge per service and per second/minute/hour of footage, which can get expensive.\n\nYou may wanna look into Veritone, which unifies all of the various AI/ML platforms and give you one place to go for many of them.  I think it's expensive: https://www.veritone.com/\n\n## Comment ID gtr36hg with +2 score by [(scythefalcon, Reddit, 2021-04-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/mmdapt/broll_organization_metadata_and_simple_solutions/gtr36hg/) (in reply to ID mmdapt):\nTake a look at [Iconik](https://iconik.io).

A quick and dirty, yet effective way to search for files on a Mac hard drive is a free application called easyfind. The icon is a little squirrel with a magnifying glass. In the past I’ve used it to find items which I could drag directly into premiere where I’d organize further. I’m sure there are better solutions but if your files are all over the place, it might make sense to organize them in an NLE in a project to project basis. As for the embedded metadata, I believed premiere has search functions that allow you to search and organize via those attributes as opposed to just the file name or whatever. Also, a massive media company I used to work for was in the process of implementing [IPV](https://www.ipv.com) which seemed to be pretty powerful. It even has a panel you can build into premiere.\n\n## Comment ID h3ut8zp with +1 score by [(garbageplay, Reddit, 2021-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/mmdapt/broll_organization_metadata_and_simple_solutions/h3ut8zp/) (in reply to ID mmdapt):\nDid you end up finding a solution in the last couple of months?

Imagine a pinball bouncing around aimlessly, constantly changing direction. Something is a major fire one week, forgotten the next, with a new urgent priority replacing it, and the cycle continues. Too much work/quantity on one's plate, and a feeling of constant scrambling and 'keeping up' becomes the norm. Makes for a hectic and unhealthy environment. And when quarterly revenue isn't met, expenses get cut to compensate and offset, and you will most certainly lose your job.",

The client comes first attitude can be problematic when the team says yes to a request without the resources needed behind the scenes to make it happen or happen in a timely fashion. Yes, the company has seen a lot of growth, but from my experience being a part of that you feel out of touch with the rewards of that growth. Just a hamster wheel and not enough comradery interally to make it feel worth it. Expect long hours with little support to alleviate you, because everyone else is working long hours as well. Personally this job drove my mental health into the ground. That’s just my personal experience and I’m sure there are others who find it to be a great place to work. I just highly doubt employees are as happy as it appears on Glassdoor.",

I found that there was a lack of support when trying to learn and progress in the company. Beyond that, I found that most people including myself were very overworked with no end in sight. The client comes first attitude can be problematic when the team says yes to a request without the resources needed behind the scenes to make it happen or happen in a timely fashion. Yes, the company has seen a lot of growth, but from my experience being a part of that you feel out of touch with the rewards of that growth. Just a hamster wheel and not enough comradery interally to make it feel worth it. Expect long hours with little support to alleviate you, because everyone else is working long hours as well. Personally this job drove my mental health into the ground. That’s just my personal experience and I’m sure there are others who find it to be a great place to work. I just highly doubt employees are as happy as it appears on Glassdoor.",

Veritone completed its acquisition of (i) all of the issued and outstanding share capital of (a) Broadbean Technology Pty Ltd ACN 116 011 959 / ABN 79 116 011 959, a limited company incorporated under the laws of Australia, (b) Broadbean Technology Limited, a limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, (c) Broadbean, Inc., a Delaware corporation and (d) CareerBuilder France S.A.R.L., a limited liability company organized (société à responsabilité limitée) under the laws of France, and (ii) certain assets and liabilities related thereto (the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) together, “Broadbean”) on June 13, 2023.\n\nRecent Business Highlights\n\nSigned 19 Public Safety & Government customers in the first quarter, which includes three new Federal customers, including a primary state law enforcement agency, intending to use Veritone Redact to automate audio and video redaction workflows, aimed at reducing lengthy manual processes, and addressing their Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request backlog.\n\nAnnounced the launch of Veritone’s AI consulting and services group to address customer and market-driven needs for increased AI enterprise-level services.\n\nVeritone continued its strong advertising momentum, with annual agency bookings growth year over year and signed several new customers, including the largest direct-to-consumer, pet supplies company, Chewy.\n\nSigned over 20 new Media & Entertainment deals in the first quarter, including new deals with Summit Media, the U.S. Soccer Federation, and NBC Universal, and renewals with key customers including Beasley Media Group, Crawford Broadcasting, and Augusta National and upsells with Golf Magazine and Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\nAnnounced a partnership with Grabyo, a leading cloud video platform for live broadcasting, live clipping, and distribution, to streamline live digital content production and leverage AI-driven content management and monetization tools to meet the evolving needs of sports organizations in today’s fast-paced digital landscape.\n\nAchieved AWS Advanced Tier Services status, advancing our AWS Partner capabilities, further accelerating partner driven revenue opportunities, and empowering Veritone to expand and deploy innovative AI solutions.\n\nNamed NAB Product of the Year for the 5th straight year for its recently launched Ask Veri solution, a new Generative AI media intelligence and natural language tool.\n\nReleased feature enhancements to its Advertising and Content Intelligence Suite designed to embrace data privacy while helping to safeguard ad revenues.\n\nQ1 restructuring of organization resulted in over $13.0 million in forecasted annualized cost savings, accelerating non-GAAP net income to as early as Q4 2024.\n\nFinancial Results for Three Months Ended March 31, 2024\n\nDelivered first quarter revenue of $31.6 million, an increase of $1.3 million or 4.3% from $30.3 million in the first quarter of 2023. Software Products & Services revenue of $15.2 million increased $1.1 million or 7.8% year over year driven by the Q2 2023 acquisition of Broadbean, which generated $8.5 million in revenue in Q1 2024, offset by the decline in legacy Veritone Hire revenue over the same period, including Amazon. Managed Services revenue was relatively flat year over year, increasing by $0.3 million, or 1.7%, to $16.4 million.\n\nLoss from operations was $21.8 million as compared to a loss of $23.6 million in Q1 2023 driven in part by a net $2.5 million decrease in operating expense including the impact of the Q2 2023 Broadbean Acquisition, a $1.1 million increase in non-GAAP gross profit driven by higher revenue, and a $0.7 million decline in non-cash depreciation, amortization, and stock based compensation, offset by a $2.5 million increase in severance and transition costs. Non-GAAP gross margin of 77.7% was relatively flat compared to the first quarter of 2023. GAAP net loss was $25.2 million, compared to GAAP net loss of $23.0 million in the first quarter of 2023, driven by an increase of $3.2 million in net interest expense associated with the Company’s December 2023 term loan, which included $1.3 million of non-cash amortization associated with the initial discount and issuance costs of the debt, offset by the $1.8 million decrease in loss from operations. Non-GAAP net loss of $7.6 million decreased by over 20% when compared to non-GAAP net loss of $9.6 million in the first quarter of 2023, largely driven by the increase in non-GAAP gross profit, coupled with reductions in our cost structure since the first quarter of 2023.\n\nDuring Q1 2024, Total Software Product & Services Customers of 3,384 was down 11% year over year on a Pro Forma basis principally due to reductions in legacy Career Builder customers transitioned off our Hire platform following our acquisition of Broadbean. Total New Bookings on a Pro Forma basis decreased by 43.1% to $13.0 million versus the comparable period a year ago largely driven by a reduction in revenue from consumption-based customers, including Amazon. Annual Recurring Revenue on a Pro Forma basis of $72.1 million decreased 36% year over year driven in large part by the decline in consumption spending from customers, offset by 7% year over year increase in subscription-based customers. Excluding the decline in consumption-based spending from Amazon, Software Products & Services revenue growth would have increased over 75% year over year.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $90.7 million, including approximately $73.3 million of cash received from Managed Services clients for future payments to vendors.\n\nBusiness Outlook\n\nSecond Quarter 2024\n\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $31.0 million to $32.0 million, as compared to $30.0 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $5.5 million to $6.5 million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $13.0 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nFull Year 2024\n\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $136.0 million to $142.0 million, as compared to $127.6 million for fiscal 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $11.0 million to $15.0 million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $37.5 million for fiscal 2023.\n\nThese updated financial guidance ranges supersede any previously disclosed financial guidance and investors should not rely on any previously disclosed financial guidance.\n\nConference Call\n\nVeritone will hold a conference call to deliver management’s prepared remarks on Tuesday, May 7, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its first quarter 2024 results, provide an update on the business and conduct a question-and-answer session.

The Company also provides certain key performance indicators (KPIs), including Total Software Products & Services Customers, Annual Recurring Revenue, Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), Total New Bookings and Gross Revenue Retention. The Company has posted additional supplemental financial information on its website at investors.veritone.com concurrently with this press release.\n\nPro Forma Software Revenue represents Software Products & Services revenue on a Pro Forma basis. Non-GAAP gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as Non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, respectively, is the Company’s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, adjusted to exclude provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of warrant liability, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, interest income, interest expense, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition and due diligence costs, gain on sale of energy group, contribution of business held for sale, variable consultant performance bonus expense, and severance and executive transition costs. The items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a breakdown of GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and these excluded items between the Company’s Core Operations and Corporate, are detailed in the reconciliations included following the financial statements attached to this news release. In addition, following the financial statements attached to this news release, the Company has provided additional supplemental non-GAAP measures of operating expenses, loss from operations, other income (expense), net, and loss before income taxes, excluding the items excluded from non-GAAP net loss as noted above, and reconciling such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\nThe Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures and KPIs because management believes such information to be important supplemental measures of performance that are commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. Management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other financial measures so calculated and presented, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Other companies (including the Company’s competitors) may define these non-GAAP financial measures differently. The non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the historical operating results of Veritone or predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn addition, the Company defines the following capitalized terms in this news release as follows:\n\nCore Operations consists of the Company’s aiWARE operating platform of software, SaaS and related services; content licensing and advertising agency services; and their supporting operations, including direct costs of sales as well as operating expenses for sales, marketing and product development and certain general and administrative costs dedicated to these operations.\n\nCorporate principally consists of general and administrative functions such as executive, finance, legal, people operations, fixed overhead expenses (including facilities and information technology expenses), other income (expenses) and taxes, and other expenses that support the entire Company, including public company driven costs.\n\nSoftware Products & Services consists of revenues generated from commercial enterprise and government and regulated industries customers using our aiWARE platform and Hiring Solutions, any related support and maintenance services, and any related professional services associated with the deployment and/or implementation of such solutions.\n\nManaged Services consist of revenues generated from commercial enterprise customers using our content licensing services and advertising agency and related services.\n\nAbout Veritone\n\nVeritone (NASDAQ: VERI) designs human-centered AI solutions.

In addition, words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “outlook,” “should,” “could,” “estimate” or “continue” or the plural, negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements, and any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and are based on management’s current assumptions, expectations, beliefs and information. As such, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement as a result of various factors. Important factors that could cause such differences include, among other things, our ability to expand our aiWARE SaaS business; declines or limited growth in the market for AI-based software applications and concerns over the use of AI that may hinder the adoption of AI technologies; our requirements for additional capital to support our business growth and the availability of such capital on acceptable terms, if at all; our reliance upon a limited number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue, including declines in key customers’ usage of our products and other offerings, our ability to realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions and divestitures, including our ability to successfully integrate our recent acquisition of Broadbean; our identification of existing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; fluctuations in our results over time; the impact of seasonality on our business; our ability to manage our growth, including through acquisitions and our further expansion into international markets; our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance and keep pace with technological developments; actions by our competitors, partners and others that may block us from using the third party technologies in our aiWARE platform, offering it for free to the public or making it cost prohibitive to continue to incorporate such technologies into our platform; interruptions, performance problems or security issues with our technology and infrastructure, or that of our third party service providers; the impact of the continuing economic disruption caused by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the war in Israel, financial instability, inflation rates and the responses by central banking authorities to control inflation, monetary supply shifts and the threat of recession in the United States and around the world on our business operations and those of our existing and potential customers; and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Certain of these judgments and risks are discussed in more detail in our most recently-filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our most recently-filed Quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and other periodic reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking information included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved. The forward-looking statements contained herein reflect our beliefs, estimates and predictions as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to revise or update the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events for any reason, except as required by law.\n\nVERITONE, INC.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED)\n\n(in thousands)\n\nAs of\n\nMarch 31,\n\n2024\n\nDecember 31,\n\n2023\n\nASSETS\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n$\n\n90,733\n\n$\n\n79,439\n\nAccounts receivable, net\n\n45,749\n\n69,266\n\nExpenditures billable to clients\n\n20,043\n\n19,608\n\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n\n15,844\n\n14,457\n\nTotal current assets\n\n172,369\n\n182,770\n\nProperty, equipment and improvements, net\n\n9,165\n\n8,656\n\nIntangible assets, net\n\n77,443\n\n83,423\n\nGoodwill\n\n79,828\n\n80,247\n\nLong-term restricted cash\n\n929\n\n867\n\nOther assets\n\n19,907\n\n19,851\n\nTotal assets\n\n$\n\n359,641\n\n$\n\n375,814\n\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\nAccounts payable\n\n$\n\n36,588\n\n$\n\n32,756\n\nAccrued media payments\n\n84,848\n\n93,896\n\nClient advances\n\n28,295\n\n15,452\n\nDeferred revenue\n\n13,415\n\n12,813\n\nSenior Secured Term Loan, current portion\n\n7,750\n\n5,813\n\nContingent consideration, current\n\n500\n\n1,000\n\nOther accrued liabilities\n\n26,275\n\n27,095\n\nTotal current liabilities\n\n197,671\n\n188,825\n\nConvertible senior notes, non-current\n\n89,717\n\n89,572\n\nSenior Secured Term Loan, non-current\n\n44,407\n\n45,012\n\nContingent consideration, non-current\n\n450\n\n633\n\nOther non-current liabilities\n\n12,531\n\n13,625\n\nTotal liabilities\n\n344,776\n\n337,667\n\nTotal stockholders' equity\n\n14,865\n\n38,147\n\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity\n\n$\n\n359,641\n\n$\n\n375,814\n\nVERITONE, INC.\n\nREVENUE DETAIL (UNAUDITED)\n\n(in thousands)\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nMarch 31, 2024\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nMarch 31, 2023\n\nGovernment\n\n&\n\nGovernment\n\n&\n\nCommercial\n\nRegulated\n\nCommercial\n\nRegulated\n\nEnterprise\n\nIndustries\n\nTotal\n\nEnterprise\n\nIndustries\n\nTotal\n\nTotal Software Products & Services\n\n$\n\n13,703\n\n$\n\n1,517\n\n$\n\n15,220\n\n$\n\n12,732\n\n$\n\n1,395\n\n$\n\n14,127\n\nManaged Services\n\nAdvertising\n\n10,975\n\n—\n\n10,975\n\n10,535\n\n—\n\n10,535\n\nLicensing\n\n5,441\n\n—\n\n5,441\n\n5,601\n\n—\n\n5,601\n\nTotal Managed Services\n\n16,416\n\n—\n\n16,416\n\n16,136\n\n—\n\n16,136\n\nTotal Revenue\n\n$\n\n30,119\n\n$\n\n1,517\n\n$\n\n31,636\n\n$\n\n28,868\n\n$\n\n1,395\n\n$\n\n30,263\n\nVERITONE, INC.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nWe are providing the following unaudited supplemental financial information as a lookback of the trailing twelve months and the comparative quarter for the prior year to help investors better understand our recent historical and year-over-year performance.

As we transition our focus from cost reductions back to growth, we are confident in our ability to capitalize on the demand for AI-driven solutions and deliver long-term value to our shareholders.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\n\nCalculated on a Pro Forma basis where noted; for additional information on these calculations, see “Note Regarding Pro Forma Information” and the definitions provided for each metric cited.\n\nRevenue of $31.0 million, an increase of 11% compared to Q2 2023.\n\nSoftware Products and Services revenues of $15.6 million, an increase of 11% compared to GAAP revenue of $14.1 million in Q2 2023, and a decrease of 25% when compared to Pro Forma Software Revenue for Q2 2023 driven by the decline in consumption-based revenue from customers, including Amazon.\n\nManaged Services revenue of $15.4 million, an increase of 11% compared to Q2 2023 driven by an increase in advertising year over year.\n\nTotal Software Products & Services Customers of 3,437, down 7% year over year, as compared to June 30, 2023 on a pro forma basis, largely driven by planned migration of legacy CareerBuilder customers off the Broadbean software platform.\n\nTotal New Bookings of $14.0 million, up 67% from $8.4 million in Q2 2023 driven by an increase in subscription-based customer bookings.\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) of $67.9 million, down from $107.9 million in Q2 2023 on a Pro Forma basis driven by declines in consumption-based revenue principally from our largest customer, offset by a 3% increase from recurring subscription-based SaaS revenue customers.\n\nLoss from Operations of $17.7 million, as compared to a loss of $28.2 million in Q2 2023 driven by the increase in revenue and lower overall operating expenses resulting from our past cost reduction plans and lower professional fees related to past acquisitions and divestitures.\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit of $24.4 million, an increase of 21% or $4.2 million as compared to Q2 2023 primarily due to an increase in revenue and improved Non-GAAP gross margins of 78.8% as compared to 72.2% in Q2 2023.\n\nNet Loss of $22.2 million, as compared to $23.3 million in Q2 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP Net Loss of $6.9 million, improving 47% as compared to Q2 2023.\n\nAbout Our Sales Pipeline\n\nOur sales pipeline represents revenue we expect to receive based on the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts outstanding at the end of the quarter and contracts that we believe have a high probability of closing in the next three to twelve months. We include in our sales pipeline fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term and we do not include any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services) and any fees payable after contract renewals or extensions that are at the discretion of our client. Many of our contracts require us to provide services over more than one year and may include professional fees required to enable our technology in certain environments we do not host or have direct control over. In some cases, our customers may have the ability to terminate our agreements on short notice and our pipeline does not consider the potential impact of any early termination. No assurance can be given that we will ultimately realize our full sales pipeline.\n\nNote Regarding Pro Forma Information\n\n\"Pro Forma” information provided in this press release represents the historical information of Veritone combined with the historical information of Broadbean (as defined below) for the applicable period on a Pro Forma basis as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of (i) all of the issued and outstanding share capital of (a) Broadbean Technology Pty Ltd ACN 116 011 959 / ABN 79 116 011 959, a limited company incorporated under the laws of Australia, (b) Broadbean Technology Limited, a limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, (c) Broadbean, Inc., a Delaware corporation and (d) CareerBuilder France S.A.R.L., a limited liability company organized (société à responsabilité limitée) under the laws of France, and (ii) certain assets and liabilities related thereto (the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) together, “Broadbean”) on June 13, 2023.

In prior periods, we provided “Ending Software Customers,” which represented Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each fiscal quarter with trailing twelve-month revenues in excess of $2,400 for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. and/or deemed by Veritone to be under an active contract for the applicable periods. Total Software Products & Services Customers is not comparable to Ending Software Customers. Total Software Products & Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve month basis and excludes any customers that are on trial or pilot status with us rather than including customers with active contracts. Management uses Total Software Products & Services Customers and we believe Total Software Products & Services Customers are useful to investors because it more accurately reflects our total customers for our Software Products & Services inclusive of Broadbean.\n\n(4) “Annual Recurring Revenue” is calculated as Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), which is an annualized calculation of the monthly recurring revenue in the last month of the calculated quarter for all active Software Products & Services customers, combined with Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) which is the trailing twelve month calculation of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Software Products & Services customers. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue is on a Pro Forma basis where indicated, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenues.\n\n(5)“Total New Bookings” represents the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts received in the quarter (including fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term), excluding any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services), in each case on a Pro Forma basis where indicated.\n\n(6) “Gross Revenue Retention” represents our dollar-based gross retention rate as of the period end by starting with the revenue from Software Products & Services Customers as of the 3 months in the prior year quarter to such period, or Prior Year Quarter Revenue. We then deduct from the Prior Year Quarter Revenue any revenue from Software Products & Services Customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue. We then divide the total Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue by the total Prior Year Quarter Revenue to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of revenue from all Software Products & Services Customers from our Software Products & Services as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn. All numbers used to determine Gross Revenue Retention are calculated on a Pro Forma basis where indicated.\n\n* See tables below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to directly comparable GAAP measures and for the definitions used for Software Products & Services Supplemental Financial Information.\n\nRecent Business Highlights\n\nPublic Sector closed 17 new public safety and government customers, including the Defense Logistics Agency, a division of US Department of Defense and the US Senate, and announced the appointment of Gus Hunt, former CIA Chief Technology Officer, as an advisor.\n\nSigned over 23 new Media & Entertainment deals in the second quarter, including a multi-year contract with the NCAA, which is expected to generate up to $40 million over the term, new deals with Tennis Australia and notable renewals and deal expansions with NBC Universal, CNBC, CNN, and Bloomberg.\n\nVeritone Hire signed significant new enterprise programmatic advertising and job distribution software deals, including global brands such as Sevita, Whole Foods, Best Buy, and Harrods and completed the beta launch of programmatic advertising solution and programmatic publisher network in Australia.\n\nAnnounced Strategic Collaboration Agreement (SCA) with Amazon Web Services (AWS), which will leverage Veritone’s and AWS’ unique strengths to accelerate cloud-native enterprise AI and generative AI innovation for new and existing customers across sectors.\n\nContinued strong advertising momentum, with top-line media bookings increasing 12% year-over-year from Veritone One and saw substantial growth from key customers such as Mint Mobile, LinkedIn, DraftKings, and Quince.\n\nAnnounced formal process to divest a non-software asset with multiple qualified bidders, which, if consummated, is expected to generate substantial cash proceeds to be used to repay a portion of the Company’s term debt and fund future operations.\n\nFinancial Results for Three Months Ended June 30, 2024\n\nDelivered second quarter revenue of $31.0 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 11% from $28.0 million in the second quarter of 2023. Software Products & Services revenue of $15.6 million increased $1.5 million or 11% year over year driven by the Q2 2023 acquisition of Broadbean, which generated $8.7 million in revenue in Q2 2024, offset by the decline in legacy Veritone Hire revenue over the same period, including declines in revenue from Amazon. Managed Services revenue of $15.4 million increased $1.5 million or 11% year over year principally due to an improvement in advertising services.\n\nLoss from operations of $17.7 million improved by $10.5 million as compared to a loss of $28.2 million in Q2 2023 driven in part by a net $7.5 million decrease in operating expenses including the impact of the Q2 2023 Broadbean Acquisition, and the $3.0 million increase in revenue. The $7.5 million net decline in operating expenses was driven by legacy cost reductions, coupled with lower professional fees related to acquisitions and divestitures of $4.0 million year over year driven by the second quarter 2023 Broadbean acquisition. Non-GAAP gross margin of 78.8% improved by 660 basis points from 72.2% in the second quarter of 2023. GAAP net loss was $22.2 million, compared to GAAP net loss of $23.3 million in the second quarter of 2023, driven by the $10.5 million improvement in loss from operations, offset by (i) an increase of $3.8 million in net interest expense largely associated with the Company’s December 2023 term loan, which included $1.4 million of non-cash amortization associated with the initial discount and issuance costs of the term loan, (ii) a one-time gain of $2.6 million from the divestiture of the Company’s energy division in the second quarter of 2023, (iii) a $1.6 million decline in foreign currency gains and (iv) a $1.3 million decline in the Company's tax benefit. Non-GAAP net loss of $6.9 million improved by 47% when compared to Non-GAAP net loss of $13.0 million in the second quarter of 2023, largely driven by the increase in Non-GAAP gross profit, coupled with reductions in our cost structure since the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, Total Software Product & Services Customers of 3,437 was down 7% year over year relative to Total Software Product & Services Customers on a Pro Forma basis as of June 30, 2023, principally due to planned migration of legacy CareerBuilder customers off the Broadbean software platform. Total New Bookings on a Pro Forma basis increased by 67% to $14.0 million versus the comparable period a year ago largely driven by an increase in subscription-based customer bookings, offset by a reduction in revenue from consumption-based customers, including Amazon. Annual Recurring Revenue on a Pro Forma basis of $67.9 million decreased 37% year over year driven in large part by the decline in consumption spending from customers, offset by a 3% year over year increase in Annual Recurring Revenue from subscription-based SaaS customers. Excluding the decline in consumption-based spending from Amazon, Software Products & Services revenue growth would have increased over 50% year over year.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $46.0 million, including approximately $39.3 million of cash received from advertising customers for future payments to vendors.\n\nBusiness Outlook\n\nThird Quarter 2024\n\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $34.0 million to $35.0 million, as compared to $35.1 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $2.6 million to $4.0 million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $7.9 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nFull Year 2024\n\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $136.0 million to $142.0 million, as compared to $127.6 million for fiscal 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $11.0 million to $15.0 million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $37.3 million for fiscal 2023.\n\nThese updated financial guidance ranges supersede any previously disclosed financial guidance and investors should not rely on any previously disclosed financial guidance.\n\nConference Call\n\nVeritone will hold a conference call to deliver management’s prepared remarks on August 8, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its second quarter 2024 results, provide an update on the business and conduct a question-and-answer session.

The Company also provides certain key performance indicators (KPIs), including Total Software Products & Services Customers, Annual Recurring Revenue, Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), Total New Bookings and Gross Revenue Retention. The Company has posted additional supplemental financial information on its website at investors.veritone.com concurrently with this press release.\n\nPro Forma Software Revenue represents Software Products & Services revenue on a Pro Forma basis. Non-GAAP gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as Non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, respectively, is the Company’s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, adjusted to exclude provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of warrant liability, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, interest income, interest expense, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition and due diligence costs, gain on sale of energy group, contribution of business held for sale, variable consultant performance bonus expense, and severance and executive transition costs. The items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a breakdown of GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and these excluded items between the Company’s Core Operations and Corporate, are detailed in the reconciliations included following the financial statements attached to this news release. In addition, following the financial statements attached to this news release, the Company has provided additional supplemental non-GAAP measures of operating expenses, loss from operations, other income (expense), net, and loss before income taxes, excluding the items excluded from non-GAAP net loss as noted above, and reconciling such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\nThe Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures and KPIs because management believes such information to be important supplemental measures of performance that are commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. Management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other financial measures so calculated and presented, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Other companies (including the Company’s competitors) may define these non-GAAP financial measures differently. The non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the historical operating results of Veritone or predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn addition, the Company defines the following capitalized terms in this news release as follows:\n\nCore Operations consists of the Company’s aiWARE operating platform of software, SaaS and related services; content licensing and advertising agency services; and their supporting operations, including direct costs of sales as well as operating expenses for sales, marketing and product development and certain general and administrative costs dedicated to these operations.\n\nCorporate principally consists of general and administrative functions such as executive, finance, legal, people operations, fixed overhead expenses (including facilities and information technology expenses), other income (expenses) and taxes, and other expenses that support the entire Company, including public company driven costs.\n\nSoftware Products & Services consists of revenues generated from commercial enterprise and government and regulated industries customers using our aiWARE platform and Hiring Solutions, any related support and maintenance services, and any related professional services associated with the deployment and/or implementation of such solutions.\n\nManaged Services consist of revenues generated from commercial enterprise customers using our content licensing services and advertising agency and related services.\n\nAbout Veritone\n\nVeritone (NASDAQ: VERI) builds human-centered enterprise AI solutions.

In addition, words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “outlook,” “should,” “could,” “estimate,” “confident” or “continue” or the plural, negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements, and any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and are based on management’s current assumptions, expectations, beliefs and information. As such, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement as a result of various factors. Important factors that could cause such differences include, among other things, our ability to expand our aiWARE SaaS business; declines or limited growth in the market for AI-based software applications and concerns over the use of AI that may hinder the adoption of AI technologies; our requirements for additional capital and liquidity to support our operations, our business growth, service our debt obligations and refinance maturing debt obligations, and the availability of such capital on acceptable terms, if at all; our reliance upon a limited number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue; declines in customers’ usage of our products and other offerings; our ability to realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures, and other planned or ongoing cost-saving measures, including our ability to successfully integrate our recent acquisition of Broadbean; our identification of existing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; fluctuations in our results over time; the impact of seasonality on our business; our ability to manage our growth, including through acquisitions and expansion into international markets; our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance and keep pace with technological developments; actions by our competitors, partners and others that may block us from using third party technologies in our aiWARE platform, offering it for free to the public or making it cost prohibitive to continue to incorporate such technologies into our platform; interruptions, performance problems or security issues with our technology and infrastructure, or that of our third party service providers; the impact of the continuing economic disruption caused by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the war in Israel, financial instability, high interest rates, inflationary pressures and the responses by central banking authorities to control inflation, monetary supply shifts and the threat of recession in the United States and around the world on our business operations and those of our existing and potential customers; and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control.

      "# [Powered Content Can Turn Fans Into Supporters by Reid Rhodes, Craig Caruso on 2024-09-26](https://www.veritone.com/blog/how-ai-powered-content-helps-sports-organizations-turn-casual-fans-into-devoted-supporters-to-increase-revenue/)\nSummary:\n\nSports organizations can maximize revenue generated per fan by increasing their avidity levels through engaging content.\n\nTo efficiently create engaging content, organizations need to digitize and consolidate their media into a singular AI-powered archive to make it more easily accessible.\n\nSports organizations can easily produce proprietary content for social media feeds, create sponsorship activations across multiple platforms, and license content to advertisers and other third parties.\n\nEvery sports team, league, and federation wants to maximize the revenue generated per fan. To do that, these organizations must transform fans from casual spectators to die-hard supporters. A survey in the United States shows that while 26% of sports fans are passionate, a considerable 44% consider themselves casual followers. The remaining 30% do not affiliate themselves with sports. Sports organizations need to have strategies for engaging all these groups, with the ultimate goal of transitioning them from casual to fanatic.\n\nThe group that is relatively easy to engage is the casual fans, who are already interested in the sport. Shifting this 44% from casual fans to enthusiastic ones significantly impacts a sports organization’s revenue, as fanatics typically spend 123% more. But the challenge lies in the creation of more fanatics.\n\nThe key to this is fan engagement through content, which needs to be a year-round initiative and not restricted to the season. 60% of fans admit that an all-year experience makes them more likely to interact with a sports organization, and 55% state it increases their likelihood of buying a ticket in the future. The challenge, however, is the continuous creation of fresh content. This necessitates complete visibility into the content collections that sports organizations have at their disposal.\n\nUnleashing a content archive\n\nMany sports organizations are sitting on a treasure trove of content. However, many have not committed to fully digitizing their archives, which is the first step in effectively sourcing and creating new, engaging content. Whether it’s a player on the eve of breaking a longstanding record, producing historical vignettes for various social media platforms, or responding to specific media requests, sports organizations need a rapid way to locate and highlight these moments, irrespective of when a content opportunity arises.\n\nThankfully, manual, error-ridden, and time-consuming processes have now been automated with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). Sports organizations can gain insights into their content through transcribed audio, logos, facial recognition, and other AI cognitive engines. The San Francisco Giants described this speed and visibility into an archive with AI content management as having their own personalized YouTube, sourcing video content in their archive with only a few keystrokes.\n\nBut first, you need to determine where your content resides. If it’s in legacy formats, you should consider digitizing this content and then consolidating everything into a digital asset management platform like Veritone Digital Media Hub with AI capabilities. As you ingest content into the platform, you can automate metadata creation to make content more discoverable for various use cases. Once AI starts processing your existing and future content, you can engage fans more effectively and open your archive to potential revenue-generating opportunities.\n\nHowever, this is only part of the equation. Sports organizations should also consider a multichannel approach to content, tailoring it differently for various platforms. For instance, millennials are 40% more likely than baby boomers to follow their favorite players and sports organizations on social media. Furthermore, 50% of Americans use a second screen to enhance their primary screen experience, presenting new opportunities for content monetization.\n\nRevealing the hidden value of content\n\nAI simplifies content management, unlocking more monetization opportunities due to increased visibility and quicker content delivery. It also assists sports organizations in creating new content, such as the ability to license specific media assets for either short-form or long-form publication.\n\nAdditionally, once content is digitized and tagged in an AI-powered platform, you can introduce AI voice and generative AI. By creating voice clones of players or other sports representatives, these organizations can tailor the fan experience even further than previously thought possible.\n\nFor example, fans could ask their favorite team questions about stats and receive responses in a specific player’s voice. They could even listen to a play-by-play feed in the same voice. LaLiga has used an AI voice assistant to answer fan queries, while the Pittsburgh Steelers have used AI to answer questions in a player’s voice, enhancing fan engagement.\n\nAnd more recently, LaLiga, Globant, and Microsoft partnered to develop GenAI solutions, including real-time multi-language subtitles for matches, automatic content translations, and real-time metrics for the coaching staff to assess team performance. Veritone has been innovating in this space, providing automated highlight generation from event metadata and content localization with AI voice in partnership with Stats Perform.\n\nSetting the stage for an AI content strategy\n\nAI will inevitably influence every aspect of the content lifecycle, from creation to distribution, revolutionizing how teams create content and ultimately connect with fans in a genuine manner. Current technology is just scratching the surface. Sports organizations that approach AI as both a creative tool and a content management automation technology will have a more effective means to drive fan avidity. In doing so, they can unlock greater revenue per fan and open up new revenue channels with their content.\n\nLearn More About Veritone's Sports Solutions\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nSan Francisco Giants Save the Equivalent of 15 Interns Doing 1 Year of Work\n\nVeritone Renews AI and Monetization Partnership with U.S. Soccer\n\nVeritone Activates 24 Hours of Action-packed Live Racing Content at 50th ADAC TotalEnergies Nürburgring\n\nVeritone Digital Media Hub Supports the US Open\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/300148/interest-nfl-football-age-canada/\n\nhttps://telescope.tv/blog/fan-driven/how-to-turn-fans-into-fanatics/\n\nhttps://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/us-tmt-engaging-sports-fans-year-round.pdf\n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160128006062/en/Millennials-Master-the-Second-Screen-More-than-Three-quarters-use-Sec\n\nhttps://www.laliga.com/en-GB/news/artificial-intelligence-and-var-take-centre-stage-during-laliga-innovation-showcase-at-the-mobile-world-congress",
