Yet doing so is required to keep witnesses safe, comply with freedom of information laws, and other public records requests.\n\nVeritone Redact systematically detects human heads, license plates, officer notepads, laptops (MDTs) as well as enables users to manually define other sensitive imagery and objects within a scene, then automatically redacts this information from audio, video and image-based evidence. From there, the redacted evidence can quickly be downloaded with logs to support chain of custody requirements and share it with colleagues, public defenders or other key stakeholders.\n\nAccelerate Evidence Redaction Workflows\n\nDeveloped for public safety and justice agencies, cloud-based Veritone Redact automates the process of obscuring sensitive imagery or audio in media evidence, significantly improving manual and time-intensive, frame-by-frame and word-by-word evidence redaction workflows.\n\nWith automatic tracking of sensitive imagery, you can use Veritone Redact to quickly tackle massive volumes of video content at incredible speed and efficiency. Additionally, you can also search for keywords and phrases captured within the recorded audio and quickly redact those items too."

They have a AI operating system (aiWare) that is designed to boost performance in several industries by transforming audio/visual/text sources into actionable intelligence. \n\nFor example, they recently announced integration of their Energy AI with NVIDIA’s EGX AI platform:\n\n[https://investors.veritone.com/news/press-release-details/2021/Veritone-Announces-Energy-AI-Integration-with-NVIDIAs-EGX-AI-Platform/default.aspx](https://investors.veritone.com/news/press-release-details/2021/Veritone-Announces-Energy-AI-Integration-with-NVIDIAs-EGX-AI-Platform/default.aspx)\n\nThey have also recently announced partnerships with Alteryx and a six year agreement with a company called Extreme E:\n\n[https://investors.veritone.com/news/press-release-details/2021/Veritone-and-Alteryx-Announce-Strategic-Relationship-to-Power-the-Alteryx-Analytic-Process-Automation-Platform-With-New-Advanced-AI-Capabilities/default.aspx](https://investors.veritone.com/news/press-release-details/2021/Veritone-and-Alteryx-Announce-Strategic-Relationship-to-Power-the-Alteryx-Analytic-Process-Automation-Platform-With-New-Advanced-AI-Capabilities/default.aspx)\n\n[https://investors.veritone.com/news/press-release-details/2021/Veritone-and-Base-Media-Cloud-Announce-Six-Year-Agreement-with-Extreme-E-to-Enable-Global-Content-Distribution-and-Instant-Accessibility/default.aspx](https://investors.veritone.com/news/press-release-details/2021/Veritone-and-Base-Media-Cloud-Announce-Six-Year-Agreement-with-Extreme-E-to-Enable-Global-Content-Distribution-and-Instant-Accessibility/default.aspx)\n\nThis is old news, but the company has already partnered with Microsoft by launching its operating system on Azure government:\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190911005171/en/Veritone-Launches-aiWARE™-on-Microsoft-Azure-Government-to-Further-AI-Adoption-by-Government-Agencies](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190911005171/en/Veritone-Launches-aiWARE™-on-Microsoft-Azure-Government-to-Further-AI-Adoption-by-Government-Agencies)\n\nI realize that this industry is very speculative, and the company is not turning a profit yet, but things are looking pretty bullish imo. The company is not holding any considerable debt and they have seen increasing revenue over the past 4 years. The recent partnerships are in a variety of industries. To me, this shows the ability for wide adoption of the aiWARE operating system and considerable future potential growth. \n\nIn the short term, earnings for the company is coming up on March 5th. Looking at the options chain for March 19th, there is quite a bit of call volume at the $50 strike price. The stock price was $36.05 at close on Friday...\n\nDoes anyone know of other companies that have similar products? Who is their competition?\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on VERI. I plan to scoop up some share before earnings.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID gp8e51w with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-02-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lunhvj/curious_about_peoples_thoughts_on_veritone_inc/gp8e51w/) (in reply to ID lunhvj):\nI got in over the summer when their price had been hammered. I’m excited about their deal with NVdia. I think they are righting the ship. I’ve seen them hiring some brilliant people in last six months in linked in. I think some of the negativity out there was because they culled some folks. But I see good things ahead for them.\n\nI’m holding long term as I bought in so low. I think they’re doing solar stuff as well. I had more hope around that front because of current admin, but don’t think solar is going to be the big deal everyone thought it would under Biden. Stocks like Cwen went up with Biden election, but now back in mid 20’s even with their great dividend yield. So have more hope with them and NVdia. I think that could be a good match for both of them.",
      "# Post ID 1d48gw6: Voice Artists who have AI model? Best model out there? with +0 score by [(MaesterJones, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceActing/comments/1d48gw6/voice_artists_who_have_ai_model_best_model_out/)\nI attended a webinar months ago discussing AI and heard from some current actors who have made a model of their voice for client usage. Carin Gilfrey was one of them, who uses VocaliD. \n\nI cant remember the other actors who were there, or what companies they worked with, but I want to explore creating an AI model of my voice. \n\nHave any of you created a model? How does your pricing structure work? How much did it cost you to create? For those of you that have explored, who has the \"best\" model? \n\n## Comment ID l6cplbb with +5 score by [(ReluctantToast777, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceActing/comments/1d48gw6/voice_artists_who_have_ai_model_best_model_out/l6cplbb/) (in reply to ID 1d48gw6):\nAny actor who is a spokesperson for an AI company is likely getting paid to talk about it, and that's always something to keep in mind when looking for a vendor for anything. The fact Carin has what is essentially a VocaliD ad on her website is a red flag too, imo.\n\nAfter 5 minutes of research into VocaliD, they have no transparent pricing on their site, several of their website links are broken (including the link to their referred ethics organization, lol), and I see they're a child company of Veritone, which is publicly traded (not inherently bad, but they have to adhere to shareholders if they want to succeed, so I don't trust that they are committed to acting ethically.) Checking their financials, they've had constant negative growth by tens of millions of dollars over the past 5 years, so they're clearly not profitable at all.\n\nYou're going to find similar things everywhere you look. Instead of customer-facing features, I'd look at company history, funding partners, staff, etc. None of these services are sustainable currently (just funded by venture capital + rich people), so discussions of customer-facing price to me feel arbitrary. If that's all you care about though, then I'm sure others can give you recommendations of what \\*they've\\* used (though I doubt anyone has done extensive research, personally).\n\n(Imo, why actors aren't getting educated on how models work + how one might make one locally is beyond me. That's really the only way to \"own\" your voice. We need more tech-savvy people in the VO community.)\n\nTL;DR - There is no \"best\" unless you're thinking short-term gains. Look into creating locally or vet the hell out of services.\n\n### Comment ID l6ct59d with +2 score by [(MaesterJones, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceActing/comments/1d48gw6/voice_artists_who_have_ai_model_best_model_out/l6ct59d/) (in reply to ID l6cplbb):\nGreat points, thanks for the reply. \n\n>I see they're a child company of Veritone,\n\nAh, I have a meeting with these guys next week. This is the *one* name of the company I wrote down in my notes. \n\n>I'd look at company history, funding partners, staff\n\nI'll see what can be dug up. \n\n>There is no \"best\" unless you're thinking short-term gains. Look into creating locally or vet the hell out of services.\n\nIt's the wild west out there. Companies could collapse next year, or be bought out by competitors. I  wish I had the know how to create my own algorithm, but that is far beyond my technical knowledge lol. Vetting is part of the reason I'm here. Wanted to see if any of you had 1st hand experience that I can consider in addition to what's on the web. \n\nI see and hear about lower end jobs that are getting swept away by AI. My goal is to hopefully capitalize on this, and maybe grab a small piece of the market, positioning myself to be the best of both worlds for the client. This is all new, it's all untested, and I'm not planning on jumping on board soon, but I do think there is opportunity here. \n\nThanks again for your input!\n\n#### Comment ID l6fqwl6 with +2 score by [(ReluctantToast777, Reddit, 2024-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceActing/comments/1d48gw6/voice_artists_who_have_ai_model_best_model_out/l6fqwl6/) (in reply to ID l6ct59d):\nYeah, totally makes sense to scope things out!\n\nNot sure which questions are allowed in your meeting, but I would be curious to know how transparent + truthful they end up being with their sourcing + business operations. At the end of the day, they can disclose whatever they want I suppose, but the more transparency, the better imo. I'm assuming most potential clients don't dig into those kinds of questions anyway, lol.\n\n\"Wild West\" is 100% accurate. It's a bummer SAG-AFTRA gave up so easily when we haven't established regulations nor frameworks for getting, at the very least, local models created, so actors have innately more leverage overall. You would think there would be \\*some\\* guidance as to who is reputable/trustworthy amidst the sea of terrible + predatory services out there. But nah, they just decided to partner with a random company (aka Replica) that could \\*maybe\\* give them more leverage for the IMA, lol. (Mini-rant over, XD)\n\nI'm personally trying to find the time to research model creation myself (software development is my day job), just so I can help contribute to the guidance that \\*should\\* already exist. But we'll see how it goes!",

Is it worth the money? Do you find the switch allows you to do more with your set up without a million pedals/changing instruments?\n\nI have a Les Paul, Stratocaster, Sg and a McCarty PRS (the push pull pots on the McCarty are what's getting me interested in veritone switch) I am going to add a semi/hollow body guitar to my guitar collection and need some opinions. \n\n\nIn my search I fell in love with the Epiphone Lucille .The binding and hardware is beautiful and the guitar has got flash. Most of all, it's the SOUND on every review video that sets it apart for me.\n \nThis would be my first Epiphone purchase and it's a hefty price tag in comparison to other Epiphone instruments. \n\nThat's why I want to ask anyone who has experience with hollow body's because videos are designed to sell products.\n\nI have yet to play one, which could sink the boat if I hate the feel, but i wanted to ask y'all if you had any opinions on this instrument?  if you have a semi/hollow body that is your go to?

The Lucille can be a bit heavier than a 335 type.\n\nThe Varitone has  uses but many players set it to the 'bypass' position.   It's mostly found on Gibson ES-345 and sometimes ES-355 models plus the Lucille.\n\nIt's more than a tone control, which just uses a capacitor to roll high frequencies off.  Varitones include an inductor or choke with capacitors to subtract some specific frequencies.\n\nNote that some of the classic guitars the Varitone was used on, also had the pickups out of phase.\n\nThis video has an explanation and demonstration using a Gibson ES-345:\n\n[https://youtu.be/hAHm7X8xmp4?si=2gnuLn5FGyd4pVp1](https://youtu.be/hAHm7X8xmp4?si=2gnuLn5FGyd4pVp1)\n\nAnd the lovely and talented Chris Buck demoing a varitone:\n\n[https://youtu.be/YENmNQh-SEA?si=uhmzGXPRxAbw7kTd](https://youtu.be/YENmNQh-SEA?si=uhmzGXPRxAbw7kTd)\n\nThe thread at this link includes a wiring diagram:\n\n[https://forum.gibson.com/topic/127119-varitone-wiring/](https://forum.gibson.com/topic/127119-varitone-wiring/)\n\nFor myself, the semi-hollow I used for some years is a 1973 Guild Starfire IV.   My last gig involved a 2003 Gretsch Anniversary, which is a wonderful guitar.   Have not gigged with my 335.\n\nMost of the time right now I have on hand a somewhat abused 61 reissue Epi Casino,  made in China but assembled in Nashville with US electronics.  Traded an Epi Wildkat that I never bonded with.   The Casino fell out of favour by the early-mid 1960's as stage volumes rose.  Being fully hollow, feedback is a real issue in that circumstance, but otherwise it's an excellent guitar.\n\n### Comment ID kwbv5yx with +2 score by [(mmfm1984, Reddit, 2024-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kwbv5yx/) (in reply to ID kw9unjv):\nThanks!!\n\n## Comment ID kw9bb4p with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kw9bb4p/) (in reply to ID 1bm3skn):\nI played one years ago and liked it. I cant remember the veritone switch, thats probably not something Id personally look. But 335 style guitars are some of my absolute favorites. They are super versatile, you can get grear blues, rock, jazz, country tones, the list goes on. Its got a short scale like a les paul but they're a lot easier on the back.\n\n## Comment ID kwad4am with +3 score by [(GibsonMaestro, Reddit, 2024-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kwad4am/) (in reply to ID 1bm3skn):\nI have an Epi Les Paul Florentine, which is a semi-hollow Les Paul. However, it comes PRObuckers, which I find more dynamic then the Alnico Classic PROs that come in the Lucille. However, it's a routed LP body, and is probably isn't a fair comparison. \n\nI also own a Squier CV Starcaster, which is built more closely to the specs of Lucille, and is very similar to the Lucille. Unplugged, it's loud. Plugged in, it's no different than a solid body, and you'll find the same with Lucille. \n\nA semi-hollow has the pickups installed directly into the center block, and is essentially a 2x4 electric guitar with hollow wings. Depending on the model, it could sound exactly like your LP.\n\nThe benefit of a semi-hollow is the light weight, not any specific \"hollow\" sound.\n\n## Comment ID kw9bkyx with +2 score by [(mmfm1984, Reddit, 2024-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kw9bkyx/) (in reply to ID 1bm3skn):\nThanks!

(I’ve got a Vox v847a at the moment.) Anyway, it’s kinda hard to explain, but from what I remember, the Crybaby is stronger, but a little more transparent in a way. It’s throaty and a little more open and clear. The WH10 is nasally and a little more apparent, but thinner. It also has a boost, which I believe the Crybaby doesn’t. Tone suck with the WH10 in bypass mode is insane, though, which I’m kinda just remembering after explaining it, so I might go with the Crybaby instead.\n\n## Comment ID gyj54ao with +4 score by [(helplesslyclever, Reddit, 2021-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/guitarpedals/comments/neye63/you_get_5_pedals_on_a_board_what_do_you_choose/gyj54ao/) (in reply to ID neye63):\nDiamond Comp >> Lightspeed >> Shallow Water >> Flint >> Volante\n\n## Comment ID gyjakw9 with +4 score by [(shambooki, Reddit, 2021-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/guitarpedals/comments/neye63/you_get_5_pedals_on_a_board_what_do_you_choose/gyjakw9/) (in reply to ID neye63):\nEq > compressor > boost > blues driver > phaser > delay\n\n### Comment ID gyjaxgo with +3 score by [(floydianslip94, Reddit, 2021-05-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/guitarpedals/comments/neye63/you_get_5_pedals_on_a_board_what_do_you_choose/gyjaxgo/) (in reply to ID gyjakw9):\nNice!

Cliff notes:\n\n-lead asset is unique in the sense that it’s been in 50+ historical clinical trials and 2000+ patients already. It was actually APPROVED for use in leukaemia in France in the 90s. This seriously de risks the drug, as most biotechs are playing with a drug that is nowhere near as known. This is more of a repurposing strategy. \n\n-recent discoveries suggest that the drug can target a wide variety of cancers through inhibiting the FTO protein, the overrepresentation of which is being linked more and more to different cancer types. \n\n-IN ADDITION the drug seems to protect the human heart from cardio toxicity induced by anthracyclines (basically the cancer drugs used today). This solves a massive problem. Anecdotal evidence from historical trials suggest this works but no conclusive proof yet. \n\n-company will be entering trials this year where they will start to get data to validate the above. If so it is starting a multi billion dollar opportunity in the face and likely has a blockbuster on its hands. \n\n-in short we have a drug that in the worst case scenario can be pushed for wider re approval against leukaemia. In the best case it is a blockbuster. I think it’s rare to have such a protected downside in biotech which makes this unique in my opinion. \n\nNot advice, DYOR\n\n### Comment ID m5cvctq with +5 score by [(dirtyvegan, Reddit, 2025-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5cvctq/) (in reply to ID m5c0vra):\nRAC is probably the only CEO on the ASX that's actively begging retail investors on hotcopper to invest in the company, while downramping other related biotech penny stocks.

Game dev company from Poland. Current market cap $4.7B USD, same as 6 years ago despite being a much bigger, more mature, scaled-up company now capable of developing multiple AAA titles in parallel compared to only 1 at a time in 2018.\n\nThey have strong IP (Witcher & Cyberpunk), a loyal fanbase and a promising pipeline of multiple high-profile titles (Witcher 4 being the front-runner). They're also expanding their IP beyonmd games to other media formats (i.e. TV shows like Cyberpunk Edgerunners). Next to that they also own GOG.com, an alternative to Steam though much smaller and not nearly as popular.\n\nNo debt and consistently profitable. Impressive sales numbers: Witcher 3 sold 50M+ copies, Cyberpunk 30M+ to date. These are 2 games that keep on generating money for CDPR.\n\nLong-term play for sure, as their next games are still a few years out and the stock probably won't move much in the meantime. The main risk being the reliance on the success of their upcoming titles which of course is not guaranteed, though I’m sure they learned a lot from the Cyberpunk launch.\n\n### Comment ID m5c1ntv with +11 score by [(CertifiedDruid333, Reddit, 2025-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5c1ntv/) (in reply to ID m5bt27q):\nI dont like the video game industry when it come to investing but I played all their games a Im really considering this one.

They’re disposing of assets that aren’t giving them a return and giving more to shareholders. They just announced a buyback as well. Factor in rising energy cost and Russian oil getting cut off in Europe as well. They also have clean energy assets as well. BP can only go up in my opinion, but all stocks can go down as well. \n\nKSS- It’s a classic cigar butt stock, the assets are the gem on the balance sheet. Debt maturities are spaced out well enough for them to keep paying debt, dividend and interest while having free cash flow left. They’re getting a new CEO who will most likely sell the company to private equity. Remember someone wanted to pay $64 a share for Kohls. Private equity even wanted to buy just some of the real estate for 1.5-2 billion. The estimated value of the real estate is around 8 billion. Factor in depreciation and we can say 5-6 billion at worst case. That’s basically putting the real estate in range of 3-6X the market cap. Worst case scenario you get a run up and hopefully sell out. Best case scenario you see a deal go through and get an arbitrage opportunity. \n\nI’m also currently looking into Jack, but not sold on this one yet. My research hasn’t given me a true bull case for a turnaround yet. It’s mainly based off expansion, automation and menu changes. Definitely room for growth when comparing to BK and Wendy’s numbers, but not sure this management can do that. Especially after Del Taco dragging the entire company down last quarter.\n\n## Comment ID m5gyzp3 with +3 score by [(Physical-Squirrel-40, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5gyzp3/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nSMCI\n\nThe correction was excessive and it appears all issues have been resolved.

This is a tiny company (market cap \\~$21M CAD) that’s flying under the radar despite its compelling value and growth story.\n\n**Why it's underrated:**\n\n1. **Deep undervaluation**: The company’s total assets (\\~$38M CAD) are nearly double its market cap, and it’s debt-free with growing cash flows. Omni-Lite’s profitable operations suggest the market hasn’t priced it anywhere close to fair value.\n2. **Big partnerships for a small player**: For such a small company, they’ve secured partnerships with aerospace and defense giants. Think Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon. It’s almost unheard of for a microcap to be this integrated into critical supply chains.\n3. **Diverse business segments in high-growth markets**: Omni-Lite operates across Metal Forming, Investment Casting, and Micro Electronics—targeting booming sectors like aerospace, defense, and industrial manufacturing. These are markets benefiting from megatrends like increased defense spending and reshoring of manufacturing.\n4. **Positioned for scaling**: Recent investments in automation and operational efficiencies are boosting EBITDA and positioning them for increased output. The company is primed to capitalize on growing demand for aerospace components, especially with a focus on localized manufacturing.\n5. **Bonus kicker**: They hold a 16.3% stake in California Nanotechnologies ($CANOF), a rapidly growing materials innovator that’s making waves in aerospace and renewables. This stake alone represents a meaningful chunk of Omni-Lite’s value.\n\n**The downside?** As a microcap, it’s illiquid and carries risks like customer concentration, but the upside is huge if management continues executing.\n\nAs always, this is not financial advice and DYOR.\n\n## Comment ID m5d1e4u with +1 score by [(Bung_a_low, Reddit, 2025-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5d1e4u/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nIron mountain\n\n## Comment ID m5d1em4 with +1 score by [(What_If_Guy7, Reddit, 2025-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5d1em4/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nLandbridge and rightmove\n\n## Comment ID m5d1mfn with +1 score by [(slack0re, Reddit, 2025-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5d1mfn/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nBLDP.to\n\n## Comment ID m5d3qzl with +1 score by [(turtles9246, Reddit, 2025-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5d3qzl/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nRIVN\n\n## Comment ID m5d4a98 with +1 score by [(Overtons_Window, Reddit, 2025-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5d4a98/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nDTC.

Today trades at $2.11 despite reputation, profitability, and growing EV sales worldwide. Some cutting edge and highly rated  “built from the ground up” EVs out and more coming soon, including the 7 seat EX90 SUV that is build in South Carolina, US for domestic and export. The 5 seat EX30 SUV that is just now being sold in the US will be made in Ghent, Belgium later this year too, and that one is going to compete with the Tesla 3.\n\nThe company announced 100% EV by 2030 but pulled back to 90%+ which is still outstanding, and they discontinued their diesels last year.  I think once Americans start seeing and buying their EVs this year the stock will reflect that growing interest in their new products.

I think this is the best hidden stock in history at this point, lol.\n\n## Comment ID m5em4mm with +1 score by [(Flock-of-bagels2, Reddit, 2025-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5em4mm/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nAGYP, now that bitcoin is $100k range it should be profitable at some point in the near future\n\n## Comment ID m5em91p with +1 score by [(EdderMoney, Reddit, 2025-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5em91p/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nENE is a good one.\n\n## Comment ID m5en0en with +1 score by [(OkBack3207, Reddit, 2025-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5en0en/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nZeta\n\n## Comment ID m5epgj0 with +1 score by [(Glittering_Water3645, Reddit, 2025-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5epgj0/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nEvolution\n\n7% free cash flow yield currently\n\n10-15% estimated EPS/revenue growth\n\nForward PE around 12\n\n55% cash flow margin\n\n## Comment ID m5ephpg with +1 score by [(kumaratein, Reddit, 2025-01-04)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5ephpg/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nRight now it has to be Berkshire and JPM.

Recent insider selling at-price with current shares at the time has now expired, meaning they cannot sell at that price anymore, so the limitation has been lifted. Earnings are projected to produce a highly undervalued PE for the ticker but confidence in the company seems perhaps impacted by short interest. Unclear to me why people are not so confident but the company seems to me to be a surefire route to doubling in value or more (it has done so many times up to now).

They are in a bit of a pickle at the moment, but it’s a good company that has a bright future ahead, and they’re doing all the right things on paper. They also made it into the S&P SmallCap 600 last week. But it’s an oil stock (but not like the other regular oil stocks - I feel it almost works as a hedge against oil stocks actually), and gives out 12% in dividends (and I don’t get why when their ROIC is brilliant). So, technically, I just need it to stay at around the same price and still make me 12% annually - the rise that is going to come in the next few years is just a bonus.\n\nABF is a brilliant company that produces half the stuff you see in British supermarkets (my wife swears by a lot of their products), and owns Primark, a budget fashion retailer (which should see more business in times of cost of living crises as is happening in the UK right now. Stock is down because most of the org’s money comes from sugar, and Mr. Market thinks sugar profits are going to go down. But if you look at all the their competitors, they are planning on cutting sugar production - so it shouldn’t be as bad as Mr. Market is expecting. Either which way, it’s a brilliant company with good moat in the UK, and I have convinced myself years ago that if I find a brilliant company like this and I have no idea why its stock is down after doing all my research (and I know why everyone else is selling), I buy it - which is what I have done.\n\nThey’re both 10% each of my portfolio now.\n\n## Comment ID m5fxiwy with +1 score by [(DiamondHandsDevito, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5fxiwy/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nFuck emerging industries - the shrinking ones are better.\n\nCard Factory PLC & EVOKE PLC\n\nAlso a dash of PAH3 & WRKS\n\n## Comment ID m5fxmzw with +1 score by [(MaleficentCup7003, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5fxmzw/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nASML\n\n## Comment ID m5fz400 with +1 score by [(FACOSERO, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5fz400/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nVITL\n\n## Comment ID m5g04an with +1 score by [(More-Guest-4852, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5g04an/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nNike\n\n## Comment ID m5g0mo9 with +1 score by [(size10feet, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5g0mo9/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nXBRA.CN - Xebra Brands Ltd.\n\n## Comment ID m5g1dnw with +1 score by [(masitech, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5g1dnw/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nRaspberry Pi stock is a good buy, imo  \nBeen using their product for a long time, (commercially + hobbyist).   \nThe CEO is awesome, they have a good team of people and their products sells well.\n\n## Comment ID m5g3fuu with +1 score by [(nasa_rocket20, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5g3fuu/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nAMPG\n\n## Comment ID m5g3pyg with +1 score by [(Effective-Island8395, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5g3pyg/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nSMCI\n\n## Comment ID m5g3ybx with +1 score by [(Willing-Log-3185, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5g3ybx/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nFairfax Financial Holdings\n\n## Comment ID m5g3z29 with +1 score by [(Touchmycookies, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5g3z29/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nSpeculatice: BBAI\nUndervalued: GOOG\n\n## Comment ID m5g6ude with +1 score by [(Kay312010, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5g6ude/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nWSM\n\nSFM\n\nFTNT\n\n## Comment ID m5g7k89 with +1 score by [(Menu-Quirky, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5g7k89/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nI own CVS and Walgreens stocks and want to buy dollar general\n\n### Comment ID m5g7wha with +2 score by [(smohan123, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5g7wha/) (in reply to ID m5g7k89):\nSounds awful\n\n## Comment ID m5g7pfs with +1 score by [(CookingGreatStocks, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5g7pfs/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nGME\n\n## Comment ID m5gap8t with +1 score by [(BrownMarubozu, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5gap8t/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nUnder the radar medical devices and infectious disease name is Microbix MBX.TO.

(MU) is currently trading at $89.87 per share.\n\nRecent analyses suggest that MU stock may be undervalued. For instance, Alpha Spread estimates that Micron is undervalued by approximately 31% compared to its current market price. ￼ Additionally, The Motley Fool notes that forward-looking earnings estimates imply a valuation of 11.4 times next year’s earnings projections, indicating potential undervaluation. ￼\n\nHowever, it’s important to consider recent market reactions. Micron’s latest earnings report failed to meet Wall Street’s expectations, leading to a significant drop in stock price. ￼ Despite this, some analysts remain optimistic about Micron’s position in the AI-driven market, suggesting that the current dip could present a buying opportunity. ￼\n\nIn summary, while some indicators point to MU stock being undervalued, recent earnings shortfalls and market volatility introduce elements of risk. Investors should weigh these factors carefully and consider their individual investment strategies and risk tolerance.\n\n## Comment ID m5gszkx with +1 score by [(jpolinski2, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5gszkx/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nIONQ\n\n## Comment ID m5gt0mq with +1 score by [(Uncontrolled_Storm, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5gt0mq/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nDTEAF and SURG.

Which is an absolute joke, and once again Wall St will continue to undervalue this stock because they value it like a legacy bank.\nCurrent position - LONG - 2k shares @ 7.50 \nMy 2025 price target - $23 a share by EOY.\n\n## Comment ID m5hf1en with +1 score by [(tar_baby33, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5hf1en/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nUber\n\n## Comment ID m5hg4i5 with +1 score by [(Karimm4, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5hg4i5/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nSlqt and Zeta\n\n## Comment ID m5hhnnl with +1 score by [(Shot_King_1936, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5hhnnl/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nReddit\n\n## Comment ID m5hkkpy with +1 score by [(old_Spivey, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5hkkpy/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nNVDA, er I mean OKLO\n\n## Comment ID m5hms12 with +1 score by [(harrisonxkramer, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5hms12/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\n$HOOD\n\n## Comment ID m5hncx3 with +1 score by [(Ghostrzml007, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5hncx3/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nRklb\n\n## Comment ID m5hqnz4 with +1 score by [(Over-Tea2419, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5hqnz4/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nOptt\n\n## Comment ID m5ht90j with +1 score by [(OmgSquid, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5ht90j/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nE U R O P L A S M A\n\n## Comment ID m5hvbmo with +1 score by [(TPHandsGollum, Reddit, 2025-01-05)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ht9vvb/whats_the_most_underrated_stock_youre_holding/m5hvbmo/) (in reply to ID 1ht9vvb):\nBiotech - $LPTX, cancer data for gastric and crc coming soon.

This is because the company is currently commercialising their tech.\n\nTheir process for refining biofuels is leading in the market in terms of yield and it might be the least carbon intensive process as well. The company is aiming towards cost parity with petroleum and it seems they have a clear vision to get there.\n\nThey have developed an industrially scalable process for recycling end of life solar panels. The demand for this service is huge as most old solar panels go to landfills. Hundreds of millions of old solar panels are expected to be decommissioned in the following decades. Solar panels including precious metals which there is also a huge demand for. The process is supposedly able to recycle near 100% of the materials found in the solar panels.\n\nComstock is a former mining company and sits on large deposits of gold and silver in Nevada.

Go down your list alphabetically and invest $5 in each stock alphabetically at whatever rate you're budgeted for to dollar cost average your investments.\n\n5. Hold and then keep holding. To start you'll be receiving dividend payments of a couple cents from one company or another pretty much every day. As the DRIP puts those couple cents back in the stock that paid them and you continue to dollar cost average those daily dividends will increase exponentially.

I'm in KULR and its been great, not sure if now is a good time to buy or hope it drops a bit before you jump in. AMPX is good, seems to be holding and climbing steadily. Not really a penny stock, but ACHR may be a long hold, but at $11, it might be cheap considering where it could be in a year or 2, or a few.\nYou could always go the ETF route which is probably the safer version. People scream SCHD due to stability and steady growth with a reasonable dividend. NVDA has had a mega run, but is it oversold, or is it at a bargain? We don't know.\nI think whatever you decide, if your going in on stocks, just think of that money as already gone. Maybe you'll make something, maybe you won't. But you'd be fine losing it since this is all gambling anyways.\nGood luck!\n\n## Comment ID m4bj0bf with +1 score by [(Acceptable_Age_2449, Reddit, 2024-12-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1hoflj3/how_would_you_invest_6000/m4bj0bf/) (in reply to ID 1hoflj3):\n$LODE ALL THE WAYYYYYYY 🔜🔜🔜🚀🚀🚀🌙🌙🌙\n\n## Comment ID m4bjvaw with +1 score by [(thiha3013, Reddit, 2024-12-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1hoflj3/how_would_you_invest_6000/m4bjvaw/) (in reply to ID 1hoflj3):\nspread among VOO, VTI and SCHD if you don’t have a high risk tolerance.

Like you suggested even if this space has a bright future the companies that will dominate it may not even be founded yet or existing companies with solid finnicials will bring the niche under their umbrella and use their greater resources to accomplish what a smaller company only operating in said space can't. I have a few shares of Palantir for fun, I like to pick up a few shares of stuff I want to follow, but there's no way I am investing in it heavily before there's some indication it has a future.\n\n## Comment ID j3g1r7x with +1 score by [(crypto_chan, Reddit, 2023-01-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1068hyg/ive_been_wanting_to_invest_in_companies/j3g1r7x/) (in reply to ID 1068hyg):\nNVDA\n\n## Comment ID j3hq5u7 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-01-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1068hyg/ive_been_wanting_to_invest_in_companies/j3hq5u7/) (in reply to ID 1068hyg):\nNot to sound like a jerk but the investment thesis that AI is primed for explosive growth in the coming decade is literally the least original thesis ever at this point. \n\nBig tech has already been consolidating this space for the last decade. \n\nGoogle already owns Deepmind. Microsoft is already deeply involved with OpenAI. \n\nEveryone will say Palantir and they aren't even an AI company. Meta is far more an AI play than Palantir.  Some people talk about Palantir as if Pytorch or Tensorflow is from Palantir and not Meta/Google. Those same people have probably never even heard of Pytorch.  \n\nThe AI stocks are Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon via AWS, Tesla, Nvidia and may as well throw Apple in too.\n\n### Comment ID j4fuxbr with +1 score by [(FreakoSadist, Reddit, 2023-01-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1068hyg/ive_been_wanting_to_invest_in_companies/j4fuxbr/) (in reply to ID j3hq5u7):\n> The AI stocks are Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon via AWS, Tesla, Nvidia and may as well throw Apple in too.\n\nYuck.\n\n## Comment ID j3hzasj with +1 score by [(nostratic, Reddit, 2023-01-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1068hyg/ive_been_wanting_to_invest_in_companies/j3hzasj/) (in reply to ID 1068hyg):\nthe trouble with tech is that it often develops differently from what we think will happen. \n\nback in the 1970s the focus was on big 'mainframe' computers. a prevailing viewpoint was that people would need to plug into the mainframe from remote terminals. they thought a big office building would have a single mainframe. \n\nreality turned out a lot different and many innovative mainframe companies disappeared -- ever heard of Sperry Corporation?\n\n## Comment ID j3jtlg7 with +1 score by [(Efficient_Diet_7839, Reddit, 2023-01-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1068hyg/ive_been_wanting_to_invest_in_companies/j3jtlg7/) (in reply to ID 1068hyg):\nVeritone",
      "# Post ID mmdapt: B-Roll Organization, Metadata, and Simple Solutions - Am I looking for a unicorn? with +3 score by [(kellykellyyo, Reddit, 2021-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/mmdapt/broll_organization_metadata_and_simple_solutions/)\nI feel like I've scoured this sub and keep finding something close, but here I am making this post.\n\nBackground: I am a Photo/ Video Studio Operations Director. I am editing adjacent and have been most of my career. I get a bit of editing spilled on me, but in no way am I ever fully immersed. Please excuse any ignorance I may have on what I am posting. I have been tasked with finding a simple solution to the tale as old as time - asset retrieval on a budget. \n\nWhat I want to believe simply exists is a way to type \"New York Skyline\" into a search box and out pops my answer. The answer doesn't have to be the clip itself, but if it could give me the job name, that would be a huge step ahead. Even better would be the filename itself, but I don't need to push my luck. We do have a robust job naming system. Currently we rely on our memory of when we took footage of a particular thing.\n\nI know that metadata can be added to files (we can add descriptors to our process), but how do you search it? We use the host of Adobe products. So if you search in Premiere,  are you only searching the Premiere catalog (is catalog the right word?) that you have open or can it search across all catalogs?\n\nFrom your other helpful posts, I have a tab open for CatDV, Axle ai, and Kyno but fear that those have too many features and that I'm overlooking a more simple solution that is just not uncovered yet.\n\nThank you in advance for your time!\n\n## Comment ID gtqv9je with +6 score by [(avguru1, Reddit, 2021-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/mmdapt/broll_organization_metadata_and_simple_solutions/gtqv9je/) (in reply to ID mmdapt):\nYou need a common database that can index, quite literally - hundreds of file types. Images, video, audio, all in different formats. All of these formats can retain some inherent metadata, but not all of them, and most don't have subjective metadata - just objective technical metadata. NLEs are *not* a great way to do this, as you're then limiting searching of that content to that NLE searching ability...PLUS the limited metadata management that NLEs have.\n\nThis is why a DAM/MAM/PAM is the way to go. They are purpose-built to index as many files and file types and humanly possible PLUS allow user metadata input.\n\nAs you can imagine, DAM/MAM/PAM solutions have evolved past a \"search engine\". This means automation, interop with 3rd party tools, transcoding, etc.\n\nSo, while DAM/MAM/PAM solutions may have more bells and whistles...it's because tagging and searching has been done for decades...and nature abhors a vacuum. \n\nThe next evolution is using AI/ML to tag the things you haven't. Facial/sentiment/speech/object recognition. However, these tools are usually wrapped into higher-end solutions and/or require you to train the AI/ML. Plus, AI/ML is still usually cloud-based, which means you'll need to incur cloud costs.\n\nTL;DR: you're on the right path to find a suitable DAM/MAM/PAM. Don't rely on an NLE. Choose one that has a panel inside your NLE (Premiere).\n\nThis may give you more info:  https://5thingsseries.com/episode/asset-management/\n\n### Comment ID h3ut53c with +1 score by [(garbageplay, Reddit, 2021-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/mmdapt/broll_organization_metadata_and_simple_solutions/h3ut53c/) (in reply to ID gtqv9je):\nWhat AI/ML solutions are available? Seems google photos using a business license might do a lot of recognition for you, but the folder management is atrocious on there. \n\nI'm just a small youtuber, so something super expensive isn't really an option.\n\n#### Comment ID h3v1zge with +1 score by [(avguru1, Reddit, 2021-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/mmdapt/broll_organization_metadata_and_simple_solutions/h3v1zge/) (in reply to ID h3ut53c):\nNo, not really. As each cloud provider does AI/ML differently, you're often using services from different providers, then using an Asset Management system to filter it and make sense of it all for you, the creative.\n\nIf you decide to use 1 cloud provider, than can help, but they charge per service and per second/minute/hour of footage, which can get expensive.\n\nYou may wanna look into Veritone, which unifies all of the various AI/ML platforms and give you one place to go for many of them.  I think it's expensive: https://www.veritone.com/\n\n## Comment ID gtr36hg with +2 score by [(scythefalcon, Reddit, 2021-04-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/mmdapt/broll_organization_metadata_and_simple_solutions/gtr36hg/) (in reply to ID mmdapt):\nTake a look at [Iconik](https://iconik.io).

A quick and dirty, yet effective way to search for files on a Mac hard drive is a free application called easyfind. The icon is a little squirrel with a magnifying glass. In the past I’ve used it to find items which I could drag directly into premiere where I’d organize further. I’m sure there are better solutions but if your files are all over the place, it might make sense to organize them in an NLE in a project to project basis. As for the embedded metadata, I believed premiere has search functions that allow you to search and organize via those attributes as opposed to just the file name or whatever. Also, a massive media company I used to work for was in the process of implementing [IPV](https://www.ipv.com) which seemed to be pretty powerful. It even has a panel you can build into premiere.\n\n## Comment ID h3ut8zp with +1 score by [(garbageplay, Reddit, 2021-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/mmdapt/broll_organization_metadata_and_simple_solutions/h3ut8zp/) (in reply to ID mmdapt):\nDid you end up finding a solution in the last couple of months?

No matter how well you do, or how far above and beyond you go they do not care and they won't recognize you. It feels like a circus everyday you go to work, and something setting off alarms one day won't matter at all the next. That happens nearly every week. Put hours of work in to something your supervisor thinks is a good idea and it falls by the wayside. Running in circles and chasing your tail never having true deadlines or guidance for that matter is exhausting and you're never truly at a point where you can exhale.

I’ve read a lot of negative reviews on here and it sounds like a lot of former employees who are bitter because they were laid off and are acting very unprofessional, imo. There’s no need to slander a CEO or call our software “vaporware” which is absolutely ridiculous. The fact is, usually only people who are scorned take to Glassdoor to write a revenge review, but if you can look past all the childish remarks, you’ll notice that employees that are happy are usually too content to bother with reviews, so ignore the trash talk. It was a red flag to me initially, until I realized what I was reading and chose to ignore it. And I’m glad I did, because Veritone is an incredibly great workplace. There are some issues, sure, as I think most companies have, no question. But nothing of the sort that should deter anyone from applying here. I decided to write this review to encourage people to get their facts straight before jumping to conclusions. I’m not a manager, not a high-ranking employee, not a member of HR. Just an ordinary software engineer. And I’m putting my reputation on the line to say that the bad reviews should be ignored. A good job is NOT worth the risk of missing out on, because you bought into some negative hate hype. Think about it. It’s not that hard to figure out.",

While I can understand previous comments about lack of direction in previous years, I think this is changing with new CEO, recent executive hires, and a deepening of its focus around Generative AI, which has a bright future. Good benefits are key to me, and Veritone has put a lot of effort this past year into providing Top Tier benefits while absorbing most of the cost (up to 80%). Having worked or interviewed with similar sized companies (under 1000 employees) over the past decade, it's refreshing to see a company not make you pay for 50% of the fast rising US healthcare costs. Since I am married with a few kids, it's putting hundreds of dollars per month back in my pocket. Plus ESSP and 401k match programs have ramped up, which are benefits I haven't been offered in years.",

There’s always something on fire, which happens because…\n- sales is allowed to sell things that don’t exist or on shortened timelines without getting buy in from the tech teams. Then they yell at everyone to do work faster / sooner even though they oversold it.\n- CEO only cares about the stock price because he has millions of shares of stock. Unfortunately, stock price is in the tank, which means trying to take “big swings” at growing the company thru acquisitions and/or business pivots, abandoning many of the people and clients who helped them get to where they are today.\n- furloughs and layoffs are rampant.

Many good engineers were let go after working on bad projects despite being better than engineers who happened to be on other projects.

I’ve read a lot of negative reviews on here and it sounds like a lot of former employees who are bitter because they were laid off and are acting very unprofessional, imo. There’s no need to slander a CEO or call our software “vaporware” which is absolutely ridiculous. The fact is, usually only people who are scorned take to Glassdoor to write a revenge review, but if you can look past all the childish remarks, you’ll notice that employees that are happy are usually too content to bother with reviews, so ignore the trash talk. It was a red flag to me initially, until I realized what I was reading and chose to ignore it. And I’m glad I did, because Veritone is an incredibly great workplace. There are some issues, sure, as I think most companies have, no question. But nothing of the sort that should deter anyone from applying here. I decided to write this review to encourage people to get their facts straight before jumping to conclusions. I’m not a manager, not a high-ranking employee, not a member of HR. Just an ordinary software engineer. And I’m putting my reputation on the line to say that the bad reviews should be ignored. A good job is NOT worth the risk of missing out on, because you bought into some negative hate hype. Think about it. It’s not that hard to figure out.",

Good benefits are key to me, and Veritone has put a lot of effort this past year into providing Top Tier benefits while absorbing most of the cost (up to 80%). Having worked or interviewed with similar sized companies (under 1000 employees) over the past decade, it's refreshing to see a company not make you pay for 50% of the fast rising US healthcare costs. Since I am married with a few kids, it's putting hundreds of dollars per month back in my pocket.

Net proceeds used to paydown $30.5 million in term debt –\n\n– Announced fiscal 2025 business outlook with up to 30% year over year forecasted revenue growth and over 45% forecasted improvement in Non-GAAP Net Loss as compared to fiscal 2024 guidance led by over $100 million in sales pipeline at Q3 2024 –\n\nDENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Veritone, Inc. (NASDAQ:VERI), a leader in designing human-centered AI solutions, today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“The divestiture of Veritone One marks a defining moment in our company's evolution, positioning us as a pure-play enterprise AI company at a pivotal time in the technology landscape,\" said Ryan Steelberg, Chief Executive Officer of Veritone. “With over 3,000 existing customers across Commercial and Public Sectors, we're now poised to capitalize on the unprecedented growth in the AI solutions market. As we look toward 2025, we're energized by our streamlined operational focus and enhanced ability to invest in innovation that will truly differentiate Veritone in the enterprise AI marketplace.”\n\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\n\nRevenue of $22.0 million, a decrease of 21% compared to Q3 2023.\n\nSoftware Products and Services revenues of $14.7 million, a decrease of 28% compared to $20.4 million in Q3 2023 driven by expected declines in consumption- based revenue customers, including Amazon and declines in one-time non-recurring software revenue.\n\nManaged Services revenue of $7.3 million as compared to $7.6 million in Q3 2023.\n\nTotal Software Products & Services Customers of 3,291, down 7% year over year, as compared to September 30, 2023, largely driven by Commercial Enterprise, which began sunsetting legacy Career Builder customers following the June 2023 acquisition of Broadbean, offset by an increase across Public Sector from growth in public safety customers.\n\nTotal New Bookings of $16.5 million, up 17% sequentially from Q2 2024 and 6% year over year, as compared to Q3 2023.\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) (as defined below) of $63.3 million, down from $89.3 million in Q3 2023 driven by declines in consumption-based revenue, including Amazon, offset by a slight increase from recurring subscription-based SaaS revenue customers.\n\nNet loss from Continuing Operations of $22.5 million, as compared to a loss of $26.7 million in Q3 2023 driven by lower overall operating expenses resulting from our past cost reduction plans and offset by decline in revenue.\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit of $15.7 million, a decrease of 25% or $5.3 million as compared to Q3 2023 primarily due to the decline in revenue.\n\nNon-GAAP gross margins of 71.2% as compared to 74.9% in Q3 2023.\n\nNet Loss of $21.7 million, as compared to $24.5 million in Q3 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP Net Loss of $7.1 million, which was relatively flat as compared to Q3 2023.\n\nDivestiture of Veritone One, LLC\n\nThrough October 17, 2024 (the “Divestiture Closing Date”), we operated Veritone One, LLC (“Veritone One”), a full-service advertising agency, to provide differentiated Managed Services to our customers. On October 17, 2024, we sold all of the issued and outstanding equity of Veritone One to an affiliate of Insignia Capital Group L.P. (such transaction, the “Divestiture”). Veritone One’s services include media planning and strategy, advertisement buying and placement, campaign messaging, clearance verification and attribution, and custom analytics, specializing in host-endorsed and influencer advertising across primarily radio, podcasting, streaming audio, social media and other digital media channels. We determined that the Divestiture represents a strategic shift that will have a material effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, the historical financial results of Veritone One are reflected in this earnings release as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented on a retrospective basis, unless otherwise stated.\n\nAbout Our Sales Pipeline\n\nOur sales pipeline represents revenue we expect to receive based on the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts outstanding at the end of the quarter and contracts that we believe have a high probability of closing in the next three to twelve months. We include in our sales pipeline fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term and we do not include any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services) and any fees payable after contract renewals or extensions that are at the discretion of our customer. Many of our contracts require us to provide services over more than one year and may include professional fees required to enable our technology in certain environments we do not host or have direct control over. In some cases, our customers may have the ability to terminate our agreements on short notice and our pipeline does not consider the potential impact of any early termination. No assurance can be given that we will ultimately realize our full sales pipeline.\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nSeptember 30,\n\nNine Months Ended\n\nSeptember 30,\n\nUnaudited\n\nPercent\n\nPercent\n\n(in $000s)\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\nChange\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\nChange\n\nRevenue\n\n$\n\n21,993\n\n$\n\n27,968\n\n(21\n\n)%\n\n$\n\n70,204\n\n$\n\n72,883\n\n(4\n\n)%\n\nLoss from operations\n\n$\n\n(22,492\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(25,183\n\n)\n\n11\n\n%\n\n$\n\n(67,167\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(79,773\n\n)\n\n16\n\n%\n\nNet loss from continuing operations\n\n$\n\n(22,511\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(26,732\n\n)\n\n16\n\n%\n\n$\n\n(72,072\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(76,012\n\n)\n\n5\n\n%\n\nNet loss\n\n$\n\n(21,746\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(24,541\n\n)\n\n11\n\n%\n\n$\n\n(69,175\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(70,800\n\n)\n\n2\n\n%\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit*\n\n$\n\n15,668\n\n$\n\n20,942\n\n(25\n\n)%\n\n$\n\n50,590\n\n$\n\n51,502\n\n(2\n\n)%\n\nNon-GAAP net loss from continuing operations*\n\n$\n\n(11,097\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(10,411\n\n)\n\n(7\n\n)%\n\n$\n\n(31,139\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(36,833\n\n)\n\n15\n\n%\n\nNon-GAAP net loss*\n\n$\n\n(7,113\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(7,943\n\n)\n\n10\n\n%\n\n$\n\n(21,579\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(30,523\n\n)\n\n29\n\n%\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nSeptember 30,\n\nNine Months Ended\n\nSeptember 30,\n\nUnaudited\n\nPercent\n\nPercent\n\n(in $000s, except customers)\n\n2024\n\n2023(1)\n\nChange\n\n2024\n\n2023(1)\n\nChange\n\nSoftware Products & Services\n\nSoftware Revenue*\n\n$\n\n14,694\n\n$\n\n20,361\n\n(28\n\n)%\n\n$\n\n45,549\n\n$\n\n63,643\n\n(28\n\n)%\n\nTotal Software Products & Services Customers(2)\n\n3,291\n\n3,536\n\n(7\n\n)%\n\n3,291\n\n3,536\n\n(7\n\n)%\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue(3)*\n\n$\n\n63,280\n\n$\n\n89,299\n\n(29\n\n)%\n\n$\n\n63,280\n\n$\n\n89,299\n\n(29\n\n)%\n\nTotal New Bookings(4)\n\n$\n\n16,471\n\n$\n\n15,501\n\n6\n\n%\n\n$\n\n16,471\n\n$\n\n15,501\n\n6\n\n%\n\nGross Revenue Retention(5)\n\n>90%\n\n>90%\n\n>90%\n\n>90%\n\n(1)All of the supplemental financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects the historical information of Veritone combined with the historical information of Broadbean (as defined below) as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of (i) all of the issued and outstanding share capital of (a) Broadbean Technology Pty Ltd ACN 116 011 959 / ABN 79 116 011 959, a limited company incorporated under the laws of Australia, (b) Broadbean Technology Limited, a limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, (c) Broadbean, Inc., a Delaware corporation and (d) CareerBuilder France S.A.R.L., a limited liability company organized (société à responsabilité limitée) under the laws of France, and (ii) certain assets and liabilities related thereto (the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) together, “Broadbean”) on June 13, 2023.\n\n(2)“Total Software Products & Services Customers” includes Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each respective quarter set forth above with net revenues in excess of $10 and also excludes any customers categorized by us as trial or pilot status. In prior periods, we provided “Ending Software Customers,” which represented Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each fiscal quarter with trailing twelve-month revenues in excess of $2,400 for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. and/or deemed by Veritone to be under an active contract for the applicable periods. Total Software Products & Services Customers is not comparable to Ending Software Customers. Total Software Products & Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve month basis and excludes any customers that are on trial or pilot status with us rather than including customers with active contracts. Management uses Total Software Products & Services Customers and we believe Total Software Products & Services Customers are useful to investors because it more accurately reflects our total customers for our Software Products & Services inclusive of Broadbean.\n\n(3) “Annual Recurring Revenue” is calculated as Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), which is an annualized calculation of the monthly recurring revenue in the last month of the calculated quarter for all active Software Products & Services customers, combined with Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), which is the trailing twelve month calculation of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Software Products & Services customers. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue reflects the historical information of Veritone combined with the historical information of Broadbean as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022 where indicated, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenues.\n\n(4)“Total New Bookings” represents the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts received in the quarter (including fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term), excluding any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services).\n\n(5) “Gross Revenue Retention” represents our dollar-based gross retention rate as of the period end by starting with the revenue from Software Products & Services Customers as of the 3 months in the prior year quarter to such period, or Prior Year Quarter Revenue. We then deduct from the Prior Year Quarter Revenue any revenue from Software Products & Services Customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue. We then divide the total Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue by the total Prior Year Quarter Revenue to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of revenue from all Software Products & Services Customers from our Software Products & Services as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn. All numbers used to determine Gross Revenue Retention are calculated reflecting the acquisition of Broadbean as if the acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2022.\n\n* See tables below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to directly comparable GAAP measures and for the definitions used for Software Products & Services Supplemental Financial Information.\n\nRecent Business Highlights\n\nPublic Sector\n\nClosed 13 new public safety and government customers, including the Department of Justice - Office of Public Affairs.\n\nSigned agreements with two of the largest counties in Southern California and a state-wide law enforcement agency.\n\nExpanded market reach with new strategic partnerships, including Nuix and international conglomerate, Getac.\n\nCommercial Enterprise\n\nSigned multi-year agreement with iHeartMedia, for expansion across their 850+ stations, enabling seamless and analytical process and review of unstructured audio data in near-real time.\n\nSecured AWS Media and Entertainment Services Competency in Media Supply Chain and Data Science & Analytics, recognizing our specialized expertise, technical proficiency and proven success in helping customers transform their media and entertainment operations with innovative cloud-based AI solutions.\n\nSigned agreement with E.W. Scripps, enabling their Court TV media property to leverage Veritone’s AI platform to enhance the storage, management and distribution of its extensive content library.\n\nSigned multi-year agreement with ESPN to manage their content library and extended existing agreement with ESPN to utilize Veritone’s AI platform to track the impact on native advertising placements and promotions, both spoken and visual, across multiple ESPN-owned channels.\n\nSigned a multi-year extension with the National Football League, providing searchable access to valuable sporting content to enrich its fan experience.\n\nSigned a multi-year agreement with the NCAA with a contract value of over $40 million.\n\nSigned multi-year enterprise deal with Big 4 accounting firm to build-out AI capabilities across its hiring platform.\n\nSigned several new enterprise programmatic advertising and job distribution software deals, including global brands such as Magna International, Shell Energy Australia, Marriott International, Ferrovial, Teleperformance, and Mitsubishi Chemical.\n\nCompleted the divestiture of our media agency, Veritone One, in October 2024, as described above.\n\nFinancial Results for Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\n\nDelivered third quarter revenue of $22.0 million, a decrease of $6.0 million or 21% from $28.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Software Products & Services revenue of $14.7 million decreased by $5.7 million or 28% year over year driven by expected declines in Commercial Enterprise principally from consumption based customers, including Amazon and one-time software revenue in Q3 2023 that did not recur in Q3 2024. Managed Services revenue of $7.3 million was relatively flat when compared to $7.6 million in Q3 2023.\n\nNet loss from continuing operations was $22.5 million improving $4.42 million as compared to $26.7 million in the third quarter of 2023, driven by the year over year improvement in loss from operations, coupled with a $1.6 million higher tax benefit from income in Q3 2024 as compared to Q3 2023. Non-GAAP net loss of $7.1 million decreased by 10% when compared to Non-GAAP net loss of $7.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, largely driven by the decline in Non-GAAP gross profit, which was partially offset by cost reductions enacted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Total Software Product & Services Customers of 3,291 was down 7% year over year relative to Total Software Product & Services Customers as of September 30, 2023, principally due to declines in Commercial Enterprise from planned migration of legacy CareerBuilder customers off the Broadbean software platform, offset by increases in Public Sector. Total New Bookings increased by 6% to $16.5 million versus the comparable period a year ago largely driven by an increase in subscription-based customer bookings, offset by a reduction in revenue from consumption-based customers, including Amazon. Annual Recurring Revenue of $63.3 million decreased 29% year over year driven in large part by the declines in Commercial Enterprise consumption spending from customers, offset by a slight increase year over year increase in Annual Recurring Revenue from subscription-based SaaS customers.\n\nBusiness Outlook\n\nFull Year 2024\n\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $92.5 million to $93.5 million, as compared to $100.0 million for the full year of 2023\n\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $(37.5) million to $(36.5) million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $(45.5) million for the full year of 2023.\n\nFull Year 2025\n\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $107.0 million to $122.0 million, as compared to the midpoint of $93.0 million for fiscal 2024.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $(25.0) million to $(15.0) million, compared to non-GAAP net loss midpoint of $(37.0) million for fiscal 2024.\n\nThese updated financial guidance ranges supersede any previously disclosed financial guidance and investors should not rely on any previously disclosed financial guidance.\n\nConference Call\n\nVeritone will hold a conference call to deliver management’s prepared remarks on November 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (5:30 a.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its third quarter 2024 results, provide an update on the business and conduct a question-and-answer session.

The Company also provides certain key performance indicators (KPIs), including Total Software Products & Services Customers, Annual Recurring Revenue, Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), Total New Bookings and Gross Revenue Retention. The Company has posted additional supplemental financial information on its website at investors.veritone.com concurrently with this press release.\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as Non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, respectively, is the Company’s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, adjusted to exclude provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of warrant liability, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, interest income, interest expense, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition and due diligence costs, gain on sale of energy group, contribution of business held for sale, variable consultant performance bonus expense, and severance and executive transition costs. The items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a breakdown of GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and these excluded items, are detailed in the reconciliations included following the financial statements attached to this news release. In addition, following the financial statements attached to this news release, the Company has provided additional supplemental non-GAAP measures of operating expenses, loss from operations, other income (expense), net, and loss before income taxes, excluding the items excluded from non-GAAP net loss as noted above, and reconciling such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\nThe Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures and KPIs because management believes such information to be important supplemental measures of performance that are commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. Management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other financial measures so calculated and presented, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Other companies (including the Company’s competitors) may define these non-GAAP financial measures differently. The non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the historical operating results of Veritone or predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn addition, the Company defines the following capitalized terms in this news release as follows:\n\nCore Operations consists of the Company’s aiWARE operating platform of software, SaaS and related services; content licensing and representation services; and their supporting operations, including direct costs of sales as well as operating expenses for sales, marketing and product development and certain general and administrative costs dedicated to these operations.\n\nCorporate principally consists of general and administrative functions such as executive, finance, legal, people operations, fixed overhead expenses (including facilities and information technology expenses), other income (expenses) and taxes, and other expenses that support the entire Company, including public company driven costs.\n\nSoftware Products & Services consists of revenues generated from commercial enterprise and government and regulated industries customers using our aiWARE platform and Hiring Solutions, any related support and maintenance services, and any related professional services associated with the deployment and/or implementation of such solutions.\n\nManaged Services consist of revenues generated from commercial enterprise customers using our content licensing and representation services and supporting operations.\n\nAbout Veritone\n\nVeritone (NASDAQ: VERI) builds human-centered enterprise AI solutions.

In addition, words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “outlook,” “should,” “could,” “estimate,” “confident” or “continue” or the plural, negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements, and any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and are based on management’s current assumptions, expectations, beliefs and information. As such, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement as a result of various factors. Important factors that could cause such differences include, among other things, our operations and financial results after the sale of Veritone One; our ability to continue as a going concern; our ability to expand our aiWARE SaaS business; declines or limited growth in the market for AI-based software applications and concerns over the use of AI that may hinder the adoption of AI technologies; our requirements for additional capital and liquidity to support our operations, our business growth, service our debt obligations and refinance maturing debt obligations, and the availability of such capital on acceptable terms, if at all; our reliance upon a limited number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue; declines in customers’ usage of our products and other offerings; our ability to realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures, and other planned or ongoing cost-saving measures, including our ability to successfully integrate our recent acquisition of Broadbean; our identification of existing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; fluctuations in our results over time; the impact of seasonality on our business; our ability to manage our growth, including through acquisitions and expansion into international markets; our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance and keep pace with technological developments; actions by our competitors, partners and others that may block us from using third party technologies in our aiWARE platform, offering it for free to the public or making it cost prohibitive to continue to incorporate such technologies into our platform; interruptions, performance problems or security issues with our technology and infrastructure, or that of our third party service providers; the impact of the continuing economic disruption caused by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the war in Israel, financial instability, high interest rates, inflationary pressures and the responses by central banking authorities to control inflation, monetary supply shifts and the threat of recession in the United States and around the world on our business operations and those of our existing and potential customers; and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Certain of these judgments and risks are discussed in more detail in our most recently-filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other periodic reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

supplemental financial information as a lookback of prior years to explain our recent historical and year-over-year performance.\n\nSoftware Products & Services Supplemental Financial Information\n\n(1) All of the supplemental financial information for this period reflects the historical information of Veritone combined with the historical information of Broadbean as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.\n\n(2) “Pro Forma Software Revenue” is a non-GAAP measure that represents Software Products & Services revenue as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.\n\n(3) “Total Software Products & Services Customers” includes Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each respective quarter set forth above with net revenues in excess of $10 and also excludes any customers categorized by us as trial or pilot status. In prior periods, we provided “Ending Software Customers,” which represented Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each fiscal quarter with trailing twelve-month revenues in excess of $2,400 for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. and/or deemed by the Company to be under an active contract for the applicable periods. Total Software Products & Services Customers is not comparable to Ending Software Customers. Total Software Products & Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve-month basis. Total Software Products & Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve-month basis and excludes any customers that are on trial or pilot status with us rather than including customers with active contracts. Management uses Total Software Products & Services Customers and we believe Total Software Products & Services Customers are useful to investors because it more accurately reflects our total customers for our Software Products & Services customers inclusive of Broadbean.\n\n(4) “Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)” represents an annualized calculation of monthly recurring revenue during the last month of the applicable quarter for all Total Software Products & Services customers, in each case as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue (SaaS). Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) includes only subscription-based SaaS revenue, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and more volatile Consumption revenues.\n\n(5) “Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption)” represents the trailing twelve months of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Total Software Products & Services customers, in each case, as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) includes only non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption)” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and more volatile Consumption revenues.\n\n(6) “Total New Bookings” represents the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts received in the quarter (including fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term), excluding any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services), in each case as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.\n\n(7) “Gross Revenue Retention” represents a calculation of our dollar-based gross revenue retention rate as of the period end by starting with the revenue from Software Products & Services Customers as of the 3 months in the prior year quarter to such period, or Prior Year Quarter Revenue. We then deduct from the Prior Year Quarter Revenue any revenue from Software Products & Services Customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue.

The acquisitions are a strategic bet on the growing demand for on-demand audio.\n\nVeritone One was purchased from Veritone Inc. for a potential $104 million, with the final price dependent on 2025 revenue targets. Oxford Road was privately acquired for an undisclosed price. Both agencies will continue to operate independently for the time being, but there are plans to integrate under a unified brand.\n\nOxford Road Founder Dan Granger will lead the new organization as CEO.\n\nGranger said, “Brands have been missing out on the full power of audio and creator-led content because these highly fragmented channels are challenging for firms without deep subject matter expertise. Our mission is to redefine the value of these channels for advertisers.”\n\nVeritone One President Conor Doyle remarked, “This endeavor is a pivotal moment for brands seeking the next generation of media opportunities. Podcast, audio, and creator-based media continue to outperform, but the industry still lags behind other mediums in key areas. Having a shared focus will deliver unparalleled leverage, knowledge, and results for our clients, which helps the industry monetize at greater rates. For those of us dedicated to audio, this is a very good thing.”\n\nInsignia Capital Group President and Partner Tony Broglio added, “The advertising industry continues to rapidly evolve as brands seek more effective ways to reach consumers.

      "# [Truth In The Signal: Veritone Shepherds New Epoch Of Enterprise Empowerment by Zenger News on 2024-04-16](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zengernews/2024/04/16/truth-in-the-signal-veritone-shepherds-epoch-enterprise-empowerment/)\nBy: Christos Makridis\n\n\"It’s a brother’s story in many ways,\" begins Ryan Steelberg, CEO, president, and co-founder of Veritone, reflecting on his unexpected journey from a pre-med student at UCLA to a tech entrepreneur. “It’s those two classic roles you think of in tech startups; me primarily being the front line as the public-facing business leader, and Chad always the technology and product wizard.”\n\nSteelberg stands today as a pioneering force in the burgeoning field of AI software and services, primarily for enterprises and major customers like ESPN, CBS and the US government- but also attainable to mid-sized firms as well. His entry into the tech sphere was marked by a collaborative effort with his brother Chad, a partnership fueled by their shared curiosity and passion for technology, bolstered by steady encouragement from their parents along the way, growing up in Orange County, California. Their journey would ultimately redefine the contours of digital advertising, and eventually, establish key pillars of today’s enterprise AI solutions industry.\n\nThe brothers’ first formal internet outing was launching a first of its kind real estate platform in 1994 (akin to what we know today as online real estate listing services), similar to Zillow or Trulia. A big idea for sure, but what appealed most to VCs was the potential to monetize ads across its real estate sites. \"Within three months, we had signed contracts with multiple real estate brokerages, including Coldwell Banker, Edina Realty, and Century 21 Realty, generating high demand for advertising space,\" Steelberg recalls, highlighting the rapid success of their venture. This led to the duo's initial breakthrough with the establishment of AdForce, which became the world's largest centralized independent ad-serving and management solution. Under the Steelberg’s leadership, AdForce pioneered and grew their advanced advertising platform signing dozens of industry behemoths, including AOL and Yahoo, which ultimately lead to an acquisition by CMGI for more than $500 million after going public on Nasdaq in 1999. In 2000, AdForce won the Smithsonian Award for the Best Technology in IT.\n\nDespite a big splash right out of the gate, the Steelberg brothers’ entrepreneurial journey, however, was not without its share of challenges and setbacks. Their next venture in 1999, Winfire, Inc., faced formidable monopolistic obstacles amidst the rapid proliferation of broadband technology. Winfire aimed to provide free high-speed Internet access to broadband users and was established as a DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) service provider, offering an alternative to traditional high-priced paid Internet services. The company had tremendous initial interest, quickly amassing a major paid customer base; however, a breakdown occurred with Winfire’s partnered telecom companies’ ability, or willingness, to deliver timely service, as they instead chose to prioritize existing customers over Winfire’s. It ultimately led to the collapse of the firm, which only had a total lifespan of about a year. “A big early lesson in resilience and dealing with monopolies for two guys in their early twenties”, said Steelberg. “An experience that was definitely formative in seeing all sides of the coin not far out of the starting gate, and ultimately, looking back, it was painful, but there was serious learning there.”\n\nIn 2002, the Steelbergs co-founded dMarc, at the time, the largest centralized radio advertising network and digital automation company servicing more than 4,600 Radio Broadcasters. dMarc was acquired by Google in February 2006 for $102 million in cash, with revenue targets that pushed the deal upwards of $1.2B. As of January 2009, total payouts exceeded $400 million. In 2007, the brothers founded Brand Affinity Technologies, an influencer technology and marketing services company.\n\nIt was within the crucible of these early adtech-centric ventures, ripe with experimentation, that Ryan honed his skills in navigating the intricate terrain of data-intensive environments and making sense of non-linear content—a skill set that would prove priceless in the field of artificial intelligence, where large language models and engines must effectively analyze tremendous amounts of disparate information and extrapolate faces, logos, trends, patterns, which can then be actioned in myriad ways. Since the essence of adtech lies in the ability to harness vast troves of data and extract actionable insights to optimize advertising strategies, Steelberg’s skill set seamlessly translated into the domain of AI for enterprise.\n\nHuman-Centered AI: Redefining Industries\n\nVeritone, which means “truth in the signal,” was launched in 2014 where Steelberg would serve as president from 2015 to 2022 prior to becoming CEO. Again, they began with a core mission of addressing fundamental advertising problems, like the way audio data was ingested and analyzed. Quickly, Veritone's proprietary cloud-agnostic solution, aiWARETM—which can be thought of as an operating system which AI programs are built on—represented a quantum leap in the field, heralding a paradigm shift in the way enterprises interacted with data. Leveraging multiple AI engines in parallel, Veritone's platform offered novel accuracy in analyzing and interpreting audio data.\n\n“The problem we tackled emerged when things shifted from the desktop to your mobile phone,” said Steelberg of Veritone’s beginnings. “When you started to watch a video there was no place to serve an ad adjacent to the content anymore, so we became obsessed with trying to understand native-based advertising or product placement, embedded into the content. It could be the broadcast host for a sporting event talking about Geico during a timeout, it could be a logo of a Chevy truck in a Michael Bay movie, or it could be the Apple laptop on the coffee shop counter in a sitcom. It was this incredibly rich content opportunity where frankly people are most in tune and engaged, and we knew we could figure out a way to look at this more transactionally, meaning could we start to bring structure to linear unstructured audio and video and unlock a world of new possibilities. That was the initial idea,” he concluded. From there, this initial vision of ingesting and understanding unstructured data leveraging AI, would be the foundation for aiWARE and Veritone into the future.\n\nWth a focus on talent acquisition, media, entertainment, the public sector, and generative AI, Veritone carved a niche for itself, redefining how industries harness the power of AI to drive efficiency, enhance decision-making, and ultimately, maximize human potential. At the core of Veritone's ethos lies a deep commitment to human-centered AI solutions. Unlike traditional approaches that seek to replace human effort with automation, Veritone believes in augmenting human capabilities. With aiWARE, Veritone orchestrated a symphony of machine learning models, transforming raw data into actionable intelligence across a spectrum of industries, just as Steelberg had envisioned.\n\nIn the realm of talent acquisition, Veritone's solutions are reshaping the landscape. Veritone Hire seamlessly integrates global job distribution tools with programmatic advertising AI technology. By optimizing recruiting strategies, reducing costs, and improving efficiency, Veritone helps organizations attract diverse talent at scale, reaffirming their commitment to diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Its suite of solutions for talent acquisition cater to both centralized and decentralized recruitment needs and is built on job distribution software and technology specializing in programmatic advertising. Talent acquisition teams and staffing firms can automatically post job ads to job boards, search engines and social media channels all in one place with seamless integrations into over 100 Applicant Tracking System (ATS) partners and optimize individual ads or full campaigns with AI to maximize ROI by increasing candidate volume while reducing wasted ad spend. Veritone enables streamlining of the screening processes by leveraging conversational AI to engage and screen candidates post-apply, all within an ATS.\n\nVeritone's impact extends beyond corporate corridors into the realms of media, entertainment, sports, and broadcast. Their AI solutions empower content creators, advertisers, podcasters, and producers to unlock human potential. From metadata extraction to AI-powered digital asset management, Veritone is disrupting content creation and distribution, providing proof-of-performance metrics, and maximizing the value of every piece of content. Customers can gain value from video, audio, images, text and data through metadata extraction, and search and visualization, enhancing customer support and system integrations. Veritone holds that while generative AI is already used to create outlines, jumpstart content writing and develop ad copy, it will eventually provide an ability to create multilingual content at scale, helping brands test new regions with ad promos and other AI-generated assets and such as full prebuilt campaigns.\n\n“It is in the public sector where we see possibly the greatest growth opportunity in the near term,” said Steelberg. “Where efficiency and safety are paramount, Veritone's AI solutions are making a tangible difference,” he added. Through aiWARE, law enforcement agencies, government bodies, and public safety organizations streamline previously manual processes while gaining invaluable insights from vast amounts of data. Biometric identification means law enforcement agencies can authenticate users and identify callers and suspects by recognizing voices and faces in videos, images and calls. Redaction capabilities help departments save time and costs while freeing up valuable resources by using automating the exaction of sensitive information within audio, video and image-based evidence. Transcription and translation functions enable legal and contact center teams to automate manual work with near-real-time transcription and translation of any data source, while person-of-interest tracking tracks persons of interest across video files regardless of source without using personal identifiable information (PII).\n\nEthics and Responsibility: Guiding Principles\n\nVeritone remains at the forefront of innovation through the lens of its “AI For Good” motto. Through frequent collaboration with regulators, industry leaders, and stakeholders, Veritone is shaping the future of AI regulation, ensuring that technology evolves responsibly and ethically. With a keen eye on emerging trends and challenges, Veritone is committed to empowering industries to harness the full potential of AI for the betterment of society. “We have a big responsibility here to self-police in this industry in a way that we just haven’t seen in tech, and with the rapid evolution of AI and its profound potential, companies have to lead the charge here,” said Steelberg. “Social media platforms are still trying to play catch up and we see the friction there; it’s a great lesson in how our industry can and must stay ahead of the curve of where this is all going from a societal protection standpoint.”\n\nVeritone has specifically focused on transparency in the design of ethical AI. Their solutions are designed to be easily explainable, generating outputs that are reliable and understandable, in hopes this will build trust among users, stakeholders, and the broader community. Trust is further bolstered by the company's commitment to fairness and non-discrimination, as its systems are engineered to mitigate bias and uphold fairness in their outcomes. The company adheres to stringent security and compliance practices to safeguard data and complies with industry regulations and standards. But as a serial entrepreneur with a passion to empower other innovators, Steelberg is maybe most bullish on the democratization message:\n\n“Fundamentally, we are democratizing and advancing AI access and utilization for enterprises,” Steelberg said. “However, small businesses must also have the tools and opportunity to embrace AI. To avoid the next digital divide—one where I believe the stakes are even higher than ever—small businesses must embrace and educate themselves on AI. Thankfully we have solutions like Veritone’s aiWARE and other cost-effective platforms out there that ensure CEOs can start their AI journey cost-effectively and intelligently. This is a dynamic and ever-changing AI environment that we are living through, and Veritone will continue to build solutions to make AI more accessible and actionable for all enterprises. We see ourselves as ‘wilderness guides for AI’ in a digital world,” he concluded."
