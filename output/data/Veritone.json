      "# [Programmatic Franchise Hiring & Recruitment by Veritone, Inc on 2024-06-17](https://www.veritone.com/solutions/franchise/)\nFranchise recruiting challenges\n\nHiring the right person for an open job is often a challenge. When it comes to franchise recruiting, chances are you may be faced with more challenges than simply whether or not a candidate is qualified.\n\nFor many, one concern when it comes to franchise recruiting is turnover. Quick-service restaurants and seasonal franchises often have high turnover rates. Those rates, paired with the need to keep staffing levels at a certain point so service doesn’t falter, means that hiring well and hiring quickly is important. Stores need to find as many qualified candidates as possible to ensure the business can continue to run efficiently. In today’s market, we are seeing more competition for talent than ever before, and that competition is coming from new places like retail/supply chain or pressure to increase wages and perks. But a franchisee is responsible for more than just hiring—and maintaining focus to actively build out and maintain a candidate pipeline can be difficult. That’s where PandoLogic comes in.\n\nFranchise recruiting solution:\n\nThe PandoLogic platform\n\nPandoLogic is a robust all-in-one recruitment solution for overcoming the hiring challenges that franchises may face.\n\nOur platform pandoIQ, includes programmatic recruitment and advertising coupled with Wendy, our conversational AI chatbot. We are the only programmatic platform that continuously reviews and optimizes job ad performance throughout the campaign to ensure you meet your recruitment needs—whether you’re focused more on hiring quickly or for highly specialized positions.\n\nPandoLogic can help franchises:\n\nImprove staffing levels and quality\n\nLower cost per applicant while increasing applicant conversion rates\n\nReduce employee turnover by finding qualified and high-quality candidates\n\nSource diverse candidates\n\nImprove efficiency by automating top-of-funnel tasks such as screening and scheduling interviews\n\nStretch job ad budgets 10 to 20 times further, so franchisees can move excess ad budget dollars to more strategic company initiatives\n\nThe problem: A narrow pipeline and low ROI\n\nNRV Pizza, a regional franchise based in Virginia, was only using one job site with a set budget to market their job opportunities and build a candidate pipeline. While they were investing a meaningful amount each month advertising jobs, they weren’t always seeing the ROI they were hoping for. And even when they did see a higher number of applicants, the quality wasn’t always up to the standard they look for in their hires.\n\nThe solution: Diversified recruitment sources and automated postings\n\nThrough the use of PandoLogic, NRV Pizza was able to diversify recruitment sources with minimal effort to increase their candidate pipeline. Pandologic’s programmatic job advertising platform, pandoIQ, automated and optimized job ad visibility across relevant sites in their network. This increased their exposure to the right job seekers without overspending or manual intervention.\n\nThe results\n\n472% increase in applicant volume\n\n533% decrease in cost per applicant\n\n19% reduction in monthly recruitment investment\n\n15% increase in overall employees on payroll",

From a text extraction model producing inaccurate output requiring correction, to a facial recognition model failing to correctly identify race, to a job seeker evaluator model preferring male candidates, AI model failures can stop an AI project dead in its tracks.\n\nOrganizations implementing AI need a universal way to evaluate and monitor the performance and behavior of their AI models, both pre-deployment and ongoing, no matter the vendor or features used.\n\nVeritone Benchmark helps organizations easily evaluate, compare, and monitor performance and behavior across AI models, whether homegrown, third party, or aiWARE-based, building AI model trust and explainability.

AI model support includes transcription, translation, facial detection and recognition, object detection, and logo detection.\n\nBenchmark explains the behavior of AI models by measuring and reporting on the factors or features that influence its decision making. For example, an audio transcription AI model’s features that explain its behavior and output might include audio quality, background noise, multiple speakers, subject matter, speaking speed, accent, gender, and age.\n\nUse Benchmark on your own AI models, another vendor’s models, or aiWARE’s ecosystem of hundreds of audio, video, text and data extraction models.",

Carin Gilfrey was one of them, who uses VocaliD. \n\nI cant remember the other actors who were there, or what companies they worked with, but I want to explore creating an AI model of my voice. \n\nHave any of you created a model? How does your pricing structure work? How much did it cost you to create? For those of you that have explored, who has the \"best\" model? \n\n## Comment ID l6cplbb with +6 score by [(ReluctantToast777, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceActing/comments/1d48gw6/voice_artists_who_have_ai_model_best_model_out/l6cplbb/) (in reply to ID 1d48gw6):\nAny actor who is a spokesperson for an AI company is likely getting paid to talk about it, and that's always something to keep in mind when looking for a vendor for anything. The fact Carin has what is essentially a VocaliD ad on her website is a red flag too, imo.\n\nAfter 5 minutes of research into VocaliD, they have no transparent pricing on their site, several of their website links are broken (including the link to their referred ethics organization, lol), and I see they're a child company of Veritone, which is publicly traded (not inherently bad, but they have to adhere to shareholders if they want to succeed, so I don't trust that they are committed to acting ethically.) Checking their financials, they've had constant negative growth by tens of millions of dollars over the past 5 years, so they're clearly not profitable at all.\n\nYou're going to find similar things everywhere you look. Instead of customer-facing features, I'd look at company history, funding partners, staff, etc. None of these services are sustainable currently (just funded by venture capital + rich people), so discussions of customer-facing price to me feel arbitrary. If that's all you care about though, then I'm sure others can give you recommendations of what \\*they've\\* used (though I doubt anyone has done extensive research, personally).\n\n(Imo, why actors aren't getting educated on how models work + how one might make one locally is beyond me. That's really the only way to \"own\" your voice. We need more tech-savvy people in the VO community.)\n\nTL;DR - There is no \"best\" unless you're thinking short-term gains. Look into creating locally or vet the hell out of services.\n\n### Comment ID l6ct59d with +2 score by [(MaesterJones, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceActing/comments/1d48gw6/voice_artists_who_have_ai_model_best_model_out/l6ct59d/) (in reply to ID l6cplbb):\nGreat points, thanks for the reply. \n\n>I see they're a child company of Veritone,\n\nAh, I have a meeting with these guys next week.

My goal is to hopefully capitalize on this, and maybe grab a small piece of the market, positioning myself to be the best of both worlds for the client.

At the end of the day, they can disclose whatever they want I suppose, but the more transparency, the better imo. I'm assuming most potential clients don't dig into those kinds of questions anyway, lol.\n\n\"Wild West\" is 100% accurate. It's a bummer SAG-AFTRA gave up so easily when we haven't established regulations nor frameworks for getting, at the very least, local models created, so actors have innately more leverage overall. You would think there would be \\*some\\* guidance as to who is reputable/trustworthy amidst the sea of terrible + predatory services out there. But nah, they just decided to partner with a random company (aka Replica) that could \\*maybe\\* give them more leverage for the IMA, lol. (Mini-rant over, XD)\n\nI'm personally trying to find the time to research model creation myself (software development is my day job), just so I can help contribute to the guidance that \\*should\\* already exist.

The Lucille can be a bit heavier than a 335 type.\n\nThe Varitone has  uses but many players set it to the 'bypass' position.   It's mostly found on Gibson ES-345 and sometimes ES-355 models plus the Lucille.\n\nIt's more than a tone control, which just uses a capacitor to roll high frequencies off.  Varitones include an inductor or choke with capacitors to subtract some specific frequencies.\n\nNote that some of the classic guitars the Varitone was used on, also had the pickups out of phase.\n\nThis video has an explanation and demonstration using a Gibson ES-345:\n\n[https://youtu.be/hAHm7X8xmp4?si=2gnuLn5FGyd4pVp1](https://youtu.be/hAHm7X8xmp4?si=2gnuLn5FGyd4pVp1)\n\nAnd the lovely and talented Chris Buck demoing a varitone:\n\n[https://youtu.be/YENmNQh-SEA?si=uhmzGXPRxAbw7kTd](https://youtu.be/YENmNQh-SEA?si=uhmzGXPRxAbw7kTd)\n\nThe thread at this link includes a wiring diagram:\n\n[https://forum.gibson.com/topic/127119-varitone-wiring/](https://forum.gibson.com/topic/127119-varitone-wiring/)\n\nFor myself, the semi-hollow I used for some years is a 1973 Guild Starfire IV.   My last gig involved a 2003 Gretsch Anniversary, which is a wonderful guitar.   Have not gigged with my 335.\n\nMost of the time right now I have on hand a somewhat abused 61 reissue Epi Casino,  made in China but assembled in Nashville with US electronics.  Traded an Epi Wildkat that I never bonded with.   The Casino fell out of favour by the early-mid 1960's as stage volumes rose.  Being fully hollow, feedback is a real issue in that circumstance, but otherwise it's an excellent guitar.\n\n### Comment ID kwbv5yx with +2 score by [(mmfm1984, Reddit, 2024-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kwbv5yx/) (in reply to ID kw9unjv):\nThanks!!\n\n## Comment ID kwad4am with +3 score by [(GibsonMaestro, Reddit, 2024-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kwad4am/) (in reply to ID 1bm3skn):\nI have an Epi Les Paul Florentine, which is a semi-hollow Les Paul. However, it comes PRObuckers, which I find more dynamic then the Alnico Classic PROs that come in the Lucille. However, it's a routed LP body, and is probably isn't a fair comparison. \n\nI also own a Squier CV Starcaster, which is built more closely to the specs of Lucille, and is very similar to the Lucille. Unplugged, it's loud. Plugged in, it's no different than a solid body, and you'll find the same with Lucille. \n\nA semi-hollow has the pickups installed directly into the center block, and is essentially a 2x4 electric guitar with hollow wings. Depending on the model, it could sound exactly like your LP.\n\nThe benefit of a semi-hollow is the light weight, not any specific \"hollow\" sound.\n\n## Comment ID kw9bkyx with +1 score by [(mmfm1984, Reddit, 2024-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kw9bkyx/) (in reply to ID 1bm3skn):\nThanks!

      "# Post ID mmdapt: B-Roll Organization, Metadata, and Simple Solutions - Am I looking for a unicorn? with +3 score by [(kellykellyyo, Reddit, 2021-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/mmdapt/broll_organization_metadata_and_simple_solutions/)\nI feel like I've scoured this sub and keep finding something close, but here I am making this post.\n\nBackground: I am a Photo/ Video Studio Operations Director. I am editing adjacent and have been most of my career. I get a bit of editing spilled on me, but in no way am I ever fully immersed. Please excuse any ignorance I may have on what I am posting. I have been tasked with finding a simple solution to the tale as old as time - asset retrieval on a budget. \n\nWhat I want to believe simply exists is a way to type \"New York Skyline\" into a search box and out pops my answer. The answer doesn't have to be the clip itself, but if it could give me the job name, that would be a huge step ahead. Even better would be the filename itself, but I don't need to push my luck. We do have a robust job naming system. Currently we rely on our memory of when we took footage of a particular thing.\n\nI know that metadata can be added to files (we can add descriptors to our process), but how do you search it? We use the host of Adobe products. So if you search in Premiere,  are you only searching the Premiere catalog (is catalog the right word?) that you have open or can it search across all catalogs?\n\nFrom your other helpful posts, I have a tab open for CatDV, Axle ai, and Kyno but fear that those have too many features and that I'm overlooking a more simple solution that is just not uncovered yet.\n\nThank you in advance for your time!\n\n## Comment ID gtqv9je with +6 score by [(avguru1, Reddit, 2021-04-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/mmdapt/broll_organization_metadata_and_simple_solutions/gtqv9je/) (in reply to ID mmdapt):\nYou need a common database that can index, quite literally - hundreds of file types. Images, video, audio, all in different formats. All of these formats can retain some inherent metadata, but not all of them, and most don't have subjective metadata - just objective technical metadata. NLEs are *not* a great way to do this, as you're then limiting searching of that content to that NLE searching ability...PLUS the limited metadata management that NLEs have.\n\nThis is why a DAM/MAM/PAM is the way to go. They are purpose-built to index as many files and file types and humanly possible PLUS allow user metadata input.\n\nAs you can imagine, DAM/MAM/PAM solutions have evolved past a \"search engine\". This means automation, interop with 3rd party tools, transcoding, etc.\n\nSo, while DAM/MAM/PAM solutions may have more bells and whistles...it's because tagging and searching has been done for decades...and nature abhors a vacuum. \n\nThe next evolution is using AI/ML to tag the things you haven't. Facial/sentiment/speech/object recognition. However, these tools are usually wrapped into higher-end solutions and/or require you to train the AI/ML. Plus, AI/ML is still usually cloud-based, which means you'll need to incur cloud costs.\n\nTL;DR: you're on the right path to find a suitable DAM/MAM/PAM. Don't rely on an NLE. Choose one that has a panel inside your NLE (Premiere).\n\nThis may give you more info:  https://5thingsseries.com/episode/asset-management/\n\n### Comment ID h3ut53c with +1 score by [(garbageplay, Reddit, 2021-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/mmdapt/broll_organization_metadata_and_simple_solutions/h3ut53c/) (in reply to ID gtqv9je):\nWhat AI/ML solutions are available?

As each cloud provider does AI/ML differently, you're often using services from different providers, then using an Asset Management system to filter it and make sense of it all for you, the creative.\n\nIf you decide to use 1 cloud provider, than can help, but they charge per service and per second/minute/hour of footage, which can get expensive.\n\nYou may wanna look into Veritone, which unifies all of the various AI/ML platforms and give you one place to go for many of them.

A quick and dirty, yet effective way to search for files on a Mac hard drive is a free application called easyfind. The icon is a little squirrel with a magnifying glass. In the past I’ve used it to find items which I could drag directly into premiere where I’d organize further. I’m sure there are better solutions but if your files are all over the place, it might make sense to organize them in an NLE in a project to project basis. As for the embedded metadata, I believed premiere has search functions that allow you to search and organize via those attributes as opposed to just the file name or whatever. Also, a massive media company I used to work for was in the process of implementing [IPV](https://www.ipv.com) which seemed to be pretty powerful. It even has a panel you can build into premiere.\n\n## Comment ID h3ut8zp with +1 score by [(garbageplay, Reddit, 2021-07-02)](https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/mmdapt/broll_organization_metadata_and_simple_solutions/h3ut8zp/) (in reply to ID mmdapt):\nDid you end up finding a solution in the last couple of months?

If you look at the Epiphone 345 in this post, it has the Veritone switch. Prior to maybe 5 to 7 years ago and further back, the Gibson 345's also had the Veritone switch, and the price difference was much greater than the 335. The new Gibsons are what I call fake 335s. The whole reason you would buy a 345 was for the Veritone switch and the tones it gave. BB King's and Freddie King's tones were from the 345/355 Veritone switch (the difference between 345 and 355 was one had a mono jack and the other a stereo). If you want a proper new *Gibson* 345, you have to buy custom shop for mucho premium price. \n\n[Reverb - 2015 Gibson Reissue VOS 1964 ES-345 Sunburst $3700 Canadian](https://reverb.com/ca/item/3401319-2015-gibson-reissue-vos-1964-es-345-sunburst)\n\nThose years (2015 +- 2 or 3 years, maybe 4) were quite bad at Gibson, as the president they had was trying to diversify the company too much and let quality, maybe even forced quality for their guitars, slide. But the example is what ES345s used to be. If you go back before that, this is what they were. If you look at the 60s this is it. But the difference in price was around $1000 to $1500 American from the 335 say, in 2005 (roughly, not sure if they offered it then, but circa).\n\n#### Comment ID ldz7zlb with +2 score by [(Odd-Party-440, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epiphone/comments/1e7148p/ngd_es345/ldz7zlb/) (in reply to ID ldz5be2):\nThanks,  sound's about right,  that's why I bought it.\n\n#### Comment ID ldz5oco with +1 score by [(iaminthewoods, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epiphone/comments/1e7148p/ngd_es345/ldz5oco/) (in reply to ID ldz5be2):\nAh, ok, Thanks!\n\n### Comment ID ldygmy7 with +1 score by [(Odd-Party-440, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epiphone/comments/1e7148p/ngd_es345/ldygmy7/) (in reply to ID ldy578n):\nYeah 335s are quite cheap at the moment in the UK and I was thinking of just saving money and getting the 335 however now I've got it in my hands I'm delighted with it despite the expense it's an absolute stunner, I'd  been lookin all over for nice Japanese greco or something similar but no luck with the budget I had.

No matter how well you do, or how far above and beyond you go they do not care and they won't recognize you. It feels like a circus everyday you go to work, and something setting off alarms one day won't matter at all the next. That happens nearly every week. Put hours of work in to something your supervisor thinks is a good idea and it falls by the wayside. Running in circles and chasing your tail never having true deadlines or guidance for that matter is exhausting and you're never truly at a point where you can exhale. Stay away, not worth the pennies they'd be paying you anyway.",

While I can understand previous comments about lack of direction in previous years, I think this is changing with new CEO, recent executive hires, and a deepening of its focus around Generative AI, which has a bright future. Good benefits are key to me, and Veritone has put a lot of effort this past year into providing Top Tier benefits while absorbing most of the cost (up to 80%). Having worked or interviewed with similar sized companies (under 1000 employees) over the past decade, it's refreshing to see a company not make you pay for 50% of the fast rising US healthcare costs. Since I am married with a few kids, it's putting hundreds of dollars per month back in my pocket. Plus ESSP and 401k match programs have ramped up, which are benefits I haven't been offered in years.",

Then they yell at everyone to do work faster / sooner even though they oversold it.\n- CEO only cares about the stock price because he has millions of shares of stock. Unfortunately, stock price is in the tank, which means trying to take “big swings” at growing the company thru acquisitions and/or business pivots, abandoning many of the people and clients who helped them get to where they are today.\n- furloughs and layoffs are rampant. Nobody is safe. Marketing team had turned over 3 times in 2 years. Many good engineers were let go after working on bad projects despite being better than engineers who happened to be on other projects. Nobody feels safe, and the overall enthusiasm in most teams continues to plummet.",

Having worked or interviewed with similar sized companies (under 1000 employees) over the past decade, it's refreshing to see a company not make you pay for 50% of the fast rising US healthcare costs. Since I am married with a few kids, it's putting hundreds of dollars per month back in my pocket.

Veritone completed its acquisition of (i) all of the issued and outstanding share capital of (a) Broadbean Technology Pty Ltd ACN 116 011 959 / ABN 79 116 011 959, a limited company incorporated under the laws of Australia, (b) Broadbean Technology Limited, a limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, (c) Broadbean, Inc., a Delaware corporation and (d) CareerBuilder France S.A.R.L., a limited liability company organized (société à responsabilité limitée) under the laws of France, and (ii) certain assets and liabilities related thereto (the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) together, “Broadbean”) on June 13, 2023.\n\nRecent Business Highlights\n\nSigned 19 Public Safety & Government customers in the first quarter, which includes three new Federal customers, including a primary state law enforcement agency, intending to use Veritone Redact to automate audio and video redaction workflows, aimed at reducing lengthy manual processes, and addressing their Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request backlog.\n\nAnnounced the launch of Veritone’s AI consulting and services group to address customer and market-driven needs for increased AI enterprise-level services.\n\nVeritone continued its strong advertising momentum, with annual agency bookings growth year over year and signed several new customers, including the largest direct-to-consumer, pet supplies company, Chewy.\n\nSigned over 20 new Media & Entertainment deals in the first quarter, including new deals with Summit Media, the U.S. Soccer Federation, and NBC Universal, and renewals with key customers including Beasley Media Group, Crawford Broadcasting, and Augusta National and upsells with Golf Magazine and Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\nAnnounced a partnership with Grabyo, a leading cloud video platform for live broadcasting, live clipping, and distribution, to streamline live digital content production and leverage AI-driven content management and monetization tools to meet the evolving needs of sports organizations in today’s fast-paced digital landscape.\n\nAchieved AWS Advanced Tier Services status, advancing our AWS Partner capabilities, further accelerating partner driven revenue opportunities, and empowering Veritone to expand and deploy innovative AI solutions.\n\nNamed NAB Product of the Year for the 5th straight year for its recently launched Ask Veri solution, a new Generative AI media intelligence and natural language tool.\n\nReleased feature enhancements to its Advertising and Content Intelligence Suite designed to embrace data privacy while helping to safeguard ad revenues.\n\nQ1 restructuring of organization resulted in over $13.0 million in forecasted annualized cost savings, accelerating non-GAAP net income to as early as Q4 2024.\n\nFinancial Results for Three Months Ended March 31, 2024\n\nDelivered first quarter revenue of $31.6 million, an increase of $1.3 million or 4.3% from $30.3 million in the first quarter of 2023. Software Products & Services revenue of $15.2 million increased $1.1 million or 7.8% year over year driven by the Q2 2023 acquisition of Broadbean, which generated $8.5 million in revenue in Q1 2024, offset by the decline in legacy Veritone Hire revenue over the same period, including Amazon. Managed Services revenue was relatively flat year over year, increasing by $0.3 million, or 1.7%, to $16.4 million.\n\nLoss from operations was $21.8 million as compared to a loss of $23.6 million in Q1 2023 driven in part by a net $2.5 million decrease in operating expense including the impact of the Q2 2023 Broadbean Acquisition, a $1.1 million increase in non-GAAP gross profit driven by higher revenue, and a $0.7 million decline in non-cash depreciation, amortization, and stock based compensation, offset by a $2.5 million increase in severance and transition costs. Non-GAAP gross margin of 77.7% was relatively flat compared to the first quarter of 2023. GAAP net loss was $25.2 million, compared to GAAP net loss of $23.0 million in the first quarter of 2023, driven by an increase of $3.2 million in net interest expense associated with the Company’s December 2023 term loan, which included $1.3 million of non-cash amortization associated with the initial discount and issuance costs of the debt, offset by the $1.8 million decrease in loss from operations. Non-GAAP net loss of $7.6 million decreased by over 20% when compared to non-GAAP net loss of $9.6 million in the first quarter of 2023, largely driven by the increase in non-GAAP gross profit, coupled with reductions in our cost structure since the first quarter of 2023.\n\nDuring Q1 2024, Total Software Product & Services Customers of 3,384 was down 11% year over year on a Pro Forma basis principally due to reductions in legacy Career Builder customers transitioned off our Hire platform following our acquisition of Broadbean. Total New Bookings on a Pro Forma basis decreased by 43.1% to $13.0 million versus the comparable period a year ago largely driven by a reduction in revenue from consumption-based customers, including Amazon. Annual Recurring Revenue on a Pro Forma basis of $72.1 million decreased 36% year over year driven in large part by the decline in consumption spending from customers, offset by 7% year over year increase in subscription-based customers. Excluding the decline in consumption-based spending from Amazon, Software Products & Services revenue growth would have increased over 75% year over year.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $90.7 million, including approximately $73.3 million of cash received from Managed Services clients for future payments to vendors.\n\nBusiness Outlook\n\nSecond Quarter 2024\n\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $31.0 million to $32.0 million, as compared to $30.0 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $5.5 million to $6.5 million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $13.0 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nFull Year 2024\n\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $136.0 million to $142.0 million, as compared to $127.6 million for fiscal 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $11.0 million to $15.0 million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $37.5 million for fiscal 2023.\n\nThese updated financial guidance ranges supersede any previously disclosed financial guidance and investors should not rely on any previously disclosed financial guidance.\n\nConference Call\n\nVeritone will hold a conference call to deliver management’s prepared remarks on Tuesday, May 7, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its first quarter 2024 results, provide an update on the business and conduct a question-and-answer session.

The Company also provides certain key performance indicators (KPIs), including Total Software Products & Services Customers, Annual Recurring Revenue, Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), Total New Bookings and Gross Revenue Retention. The Company has posted additional supplemental financial information on its website at investors.veritone.com concurrently with this press release.\n\nPro Forma Software Revenue represents Software Products & Services revenue on a Pro Forma basis. Non-GAAP gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as Non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, respectively, is the Company’s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, adjusted to exclude provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of warrant liability, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, interest income, interest expense, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition and due diligence costs, gain on sale of energy group, contribution of business held for sale, variable consultant performance bonus expense, and severance and executive transition costs. The items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a breakdown of GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and these excluded items between the Company’s Core Operations and Corporate, are detailed in the reconciliations included following the financial statements attached to this news release. In addition, following the financial statements attached to this news release, the Company has provided additional supplemental non-GAAP measures of operating expenses, loss from operations, other income (expense), net, and loss before income taxes, excluding the items excluded from non-GAAP net loss as noted above, and reconciling such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\nThe Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures and KPIs because management believes such information to be important supplemental measures of performance that are commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. Management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other financial measures so calculated and presented, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Other companies (including the Company’s competitors) may define these non-GAAP financial measures differently. The non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the historical operating results of Veritone or predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn addition, the Company defines the following capitalized terms in this news release as follows:\n\nCore Operations consists of the Company’s aiWARE operating platform of software, SaaS and related services; content licensing and advertising agency services; and their supporting operations, including direct costs of sales as well as operating expenses for sales, marketing and product development and certain general and administrative costs dedicated to these operations.\n\nCorporate principally consists of general and administrative functions such as executive, finance, legal, people operations, fixed overhead expenses (including facilities and information technology expenses), other income (expenses) and taxes, and other expenses that support the entire Company, including public company driven costs.\n\nSoftware Products & Services consists of revenues generated from commercial enterprise and government and regulated industries customers using our aiWARE platform and Hiring Solutions, any related support and maintenance services, and any related professional services associated with the deployment and/or implementation of such solutions.\n\nManaged Services consist of revenues generated from commercial enterprise customers using our content licensing services and advertising agency and related services.\n\nAbout Veritone\n\nVeritone (NASDAQ: VERI) designs human-centered AI solutions.

In addition, words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “outlook,” “should,” “could,” “estimate” or “continue” or the plural, negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements, and any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and are based on management’s current assumptions, expectations, beliefs and information. As such, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement as a result of various factors. Important factors that could cause such differences include, among other things, our ability to expand our aiWARE SaaS business; declines or limited growth in the market for AI-based software applications and concerns over the use of AI that may hinder the adoption of AI technologies; our requirements for additional capital to support our business growth and the availability of such capital on acceptable terms, if at all; our reliance upon a limited number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue, including declines in key customers’ usage of our products and other offerings, our ability to realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions and divestitures, including our ability to successfully integrate our recent acquisition of Broadbean; our identification of existing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; fluctuations in our results over time; the impact of seasonality on our business; our ability to manage our growth, including through acquisitions and our further expansion into international markets; our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance and keep pace with technological developments; actions by our competitors, partners and others that may block us from using the third party technologies in our aiWARE platform, offering it for free to the public or making it cost prohibitive to continue to incorporate such technologies into our platform; interruptions, performance problems or security issues with our technology and infrastructure, or that of our third party service providers; the impact of the continuing economic disruption caused by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the war in Israel, financial instability, inflation rates and the responses by central banking authorities to control inflation, monetary supply shifts and the threat of recession in the United States and around the world on our business operations and those of our existing and potential customers; and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control.

      "# [Truth In The Signal: Veritone Shepherds New Epoch Of Enterprise Empowerment by Zenger News on 2024-04-16](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zengernews/2024/04/16/truth-in-the-signal-veritone-shepherds-epoch-enterprise-empowerment/)\nBy: Christos Makridis\n\n\"It’s a brother’s story in many ways,\" begins Ryan Steelberg, CEO, president, and co-founder of Veritone, reflecting on his unexpected journey from a pre-med student at UCLA to a tech entrepreneur. “It’s those two classic roles you think of in tech startups; me primarily being the front line as the public-facing business leader, and Chad always the technology and product wizard.”\n\nSteelberg stands today as a pioneering force in the burgeoning field of AI software and services, primarily for enterprises and major customers like ESPN, CBS and the US government- but also attainable to mid-sized firms as well. His entry into the tech sphere was marked by a collaborative effort with his brother Chad, a partnership fueled by their shared curiosity and passion for technology, bolstered by steady encouragement from their parents along the way, growing up in Orange County, California. Their journey would ultimately redefine the contours of digital advertising, and eventually, establish key pillars of today’s enterprise AI solutions industry.\n\nThe brothers’ first formal internet outing was launching a first of its kind real estate platform in 1994 (akin to what we know today as online real estate listing services), similar to Zillow or Trulia. A big idea for sure, but what appealed most to VCs was the potential to monetize ads across its real estate sites. \"Within three months, we had signed contracts with multiple real estate brokerages, including Coldwell Banker, Edina Realty, and Century 21 Realty, generating high demand for advertising space,\" Steelberg recalls, highlighting the rapid success of their venture. This led to the duo's initial breakthrough with the establishment of AdForce, which became the world's largest centralized independent ad-serving and management solution. Under the Steelberg’s leadership, AdForce pioneered and grew their advanced advertising platform signing dozens of industry behemoths, including AOL and Yahoo, which ultimately lead to an acquisition by CMGI for more than $500 million after going public on Nasdaq in 1999. In 2000, AdForce won the Smithsonian Award for the Best Technology in IT.\n\nDespite a big splash right out of the gate, the Steelberg brothers’ entrepreneurial journey, however, was not without its share of challenges and setbacks. Their next venture in 1999, Winfire, Inc., faced formidable monopolistic obstacles amidst the rapid proliferation of broadband technology. Winfire aimed to provide free high-speed Internet access to broadband users and was established as a DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) service provider, offering an alternative to traditional high-priced paid Internet services. The company had tremendous initial interest, quickly amassing a major paid customer base; however, a breakdown occurred with Winfire’s partnered telecom companies’ ability, or willingness, to deliver timely service, as they instead chose to prioritize existing customers over Winfire’s. It ultimately led to the collapse of the firm, which only had a total lifespan of about a year. “A big early lesson in resilience and dealing with monopolies for two guys in their early twenties”, said Steelberg. “An experience that was definitely formative in seeing all sides of the coin not far out of the starting gate, and ultimately, looking back, it was painful, but there was serious learning there.”\n\nIn 2002, the Steelbergs co-founded dMarc, at the time, the largest centralized radio advertising network and digital automation company servicing more than 4,600 Radio Broadcasters. dMarc was acquired by Google in February 2006 for $102 million in cash, with revenue targets that pushed the deal upwards of $1.2B. As of January 2009, total payouts exceeded $400 million. In 2007, the brothers founded Brand Affinity Technologies, an influencer technology and marketing services company.\n\nIt was within the crucible of these early adtech-centric ventures, ripe with experimentation, that Ryan honed his skills in navigating the intricate terrain of data-intensive environments and making sense of non-linear content—a skill set that would prove priceless in the field of artificial intelligence, where large language models and engines must effectively analyze tremendous amounts of disparate information and extrapolate faces, logos, trends, patterns, which can then be actioned in myriad ways. Since the essence of adtech lies in the ability to harness vast troves of data and extract actionable insights to optimize advertising strategies, Steelberg’s skill set seamlessly translated into the domain of AI for enterprise.\n\nHuman-Centered AI: Redefining Industries\n\nVeritone, which means “truth in the signal,” was launched in 2014 where Steelberg would serve as president from 2015 to 2022 prior to becoming CEO. Again, they began with a core mission of addressing fundamental advertising problems, like the way audio data was ingested and analyzed. Quickly, Veritone's proprietary cloud-agnostic solution, aiWARETM—which can be thought of as an operating system which AI programs are built on—represented a quantum leap in the field, heralding a paradigm shift in the way enterprises interacted with data. Leveraging multiple AI engines in parallel, Veritone's platform offered novel accuracy in analyzing and interpreting audio data.\n\n“The problem we tackled emerged when things shifted from the desktop to your mobile phone,” said Steelberg of Veritone’s beginnings. “When you started to watch a video there was no place to serve an ad adjacent to the content anymore, so we became obsessed with trying to understand native-based advertising or product placement, embedded into the content. It could be the broadcast host for a sporting event talking about Geico during a timeout, it could be a logo of a Chevy truck in a Michael Bay movie, or it could be the Apple laptop on the coffee shop counter in a sitcom. It was this incredibly rich content opportunity where frankly people are most in tune and engaged, and we knew we could figure out a way to look at this more transactionally, meaning could we start to bring structure to linear unstructured audio and video and unlock a world of new possibilities. That was the initial idea,” he concluded. From there, this initial vision of ingesting and understanding unstructured data leveraging AI, would be the foundation for aiWARE and Veritone into the future.\n\nWth a focus on talent acquisition, media, entertainment, the public sector, and generative AI, Veritone carved a niche for itself, redefining how industries harness the power of AI to drive efficiency, enhance decision-making, and ultimately, maximize human potential. At the core of Veritone's ethos lies a deep commitment to human-centered AI solutions. Unlike traditional approaches that seek to replace human effort with automation, Veritone believes in augmenting human capabilities. With aiWARE, Veritone orchestrated a symphony of machine learning models, transforming raw data into actionable intelligence across a spectrum of industries, just as Steelberg had envisioned.\n\nIn the realm of talent acquisition, Veritone's solutions are reshaping the landscape. Veritone Hire seamlessly integrates global job distribution tools with programmatic advertising AI technology. By optimizing recruiting strategies, reducing costs, and improving efficiency, Veritone helps organizations attract diverse talent at scale, reaffirming their commitment to diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Its suite of solutions for talent acquisition cater to both centralized and decentralized recruitment needs and is built on job distribution software and technology specializing in programmatic advertising. Talent acquisition teams and staffing firms can automatically post job ads to job boards, search engines and social media channels all in one place with seamless integrations into over 100 Applicant Tracking System (ATS) partners and optimize individual ads or full campaigns with AI to maximize ROI by increasing candidate volume while reducing wasted ad spend. Veritone enables streamlining of the screening processes by leveraging conversational AI to engage and screen candidates post-apply, all within an ATS.\n\nVeritone's impact extends beyond corporate corridors into the realms of media, entertainment, sports, and broadcast. Their AI solutions empower content creators, advertisers, podcasters, and producers to unlock human potential. From metadata extraction to AI-powered digital asset management, Veritone is disrupting content creation and distribution, providing proof-of-performance metrics, and maximizing the value of every piece of content. Customers can gain value from video, audio, images, text and data through metadata extraction, and search and visualization, enhancing customer support and system integrations. Veritone holds that while generative AI is already used to create outlines, jumpstart content writing and develop ad copy, it will eventually provide an ability to create multilingual content at scale, helping brands test new regions with ad promos and other AI-generated assets and such as full prebuilt campaigns.\n\n“It is in the public sector where we see possibly the greatest growth opportunity in the near term,” said Steelberg. “Where efficiency and safety are paramount, Veritone's AI solutions are making a tangible difference,” he added. Through aiWARE, law enforcement agencies, government bodies, and public safety organizations streamline previously manual processes while gaining invaluable insights from vast amounts of data. Biometric identification means law enforcement agencies can authenticate users and identify callers and suspects by recognizing voices and faces in videos, images and calls. Redaction capabilities help departments save time and costs while freeing up valuable resources by using automating the exaction of sensitive information within audio, video and image-based evidence. Transcription and translation functions enable legal and contact center teams to automate manual work with near-real-time transcription and translation of any data source, while person-of-interest tracking tracks persons of interest across video files regardless of source without using personal identifiable information (PII).\n\nEthics and Responsibility: Guiding Principles\n\nVeritone remains at the forefront of innovation through the lens of its “AI For Good” motto. Through frequent collaboration with regulators, industry leaders, and stakeholders, Veritone is shaping the future of AI regulation, ensuring that technology evolves responsibly and ethically. With a keen eye on emerging trends and challenges, Veritone is committed to empowering industries to harness the full potential of AI for the betterment of society. “We have a big responsibility here to self-police in this industry in a way that we just haven’t seen in tech, and with the rapid evolution of AI and its profound potential, companies have to lead the charge here,” said Steelberg. “Social media platforms are still trying to play catch up and we see the friction there; it’s a great lesson in how our industry can and must stay ahead of the curve of where this is all going from a societal protection standpoint.”\n\nVeritone has specifically focused on transparency in the design of ethical AI. Their solutions are designed to be easily explainable, generating outputs that are reliable and understandable, in hopes this will build trust among users, stakeholders, and the broader community. Trust is further bolstered by the company's commitment to fairness and non-discrimination, as its systems are engineered to mitigate bias and uphold fairness in their outcomes. The company adheres to stringent security and compliance practices to safeguard data and complies with industry regulations and standards. But as a serial entrepreneur with a passion to empower other innovators, Steelberg is maybe most bullish on the democratization message:\n\n“Fundamentally, we are democratizing and advancing AI access and utilization for enterprises,” Steelberg said. “However, small businesses must also have the tools and opportunity to embrace AI. To avoid the next digital divide—one where I believe the stakes are even higher than ever—small businesses must embrace and educate themselves on AI. Thankfully we have solutions like Veritone’s aiWARE and other cost-effective platforms out there that ensure CEOs can start their AI journey cost-effectively and intelligently. This is a dynamic and ever-changing AI environment that we are living through, and Veritone will continue to build solutions to make AI more accessible and actionable for all enterprises. We see ourselves as ‘wilderness guides for AI’ in a digital world,” he concluded.",
