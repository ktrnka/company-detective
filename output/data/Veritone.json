      "# Post ID 1d48gw6: Voice Artists who have AI model? Best model out there? with +0 score by [(MaesterJones, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceActing/comments/1d48gw6/voice_artists_who_have_ai_model_best_model_out/)\nI attended a webinar months ago discussing AI and heard from some current actors who have made a model of their voice for client usage. Carin Gilfrey was one of them, who uses VocaliD. \n\nI cant remember the other actors who were there, or what companies they worked with, but I want to explore creating an AI model of my voice. \n\nHave any of you created a model? How does your pricing structure work? How much did it cost you to create? For those of you that have explored, who has the \"best\" model? \n\n## Comment ID l6cplbb with +5 score by [(ReluctantToast777, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceActing/comments/1d48gw6/voice_artists_who_have_ai_model_best_model_out/l6cplbb/) (in reply to ID 1d48gw6):\nAny actor who is a spokesperson for an AI company is likely getting paid to talk about it, and that's always something to keep in mind when looking for a vendor for anything. The fact Carin has what is essentially a VocaliD ad on her website is a red flag too, imo.\n\nAfter 5 minutes of research into VocaliD, they have no transparent pricing on their site, several of their website links are broken (including the link to their referred ethics organization, lol), and I see they're a child company of Veritone, which is publicly traded (not inherently bad, but they have to adhere to shareholders if they want to succeed, so I don't trust that they are committed to acting ethically.) Checking their financials, they've had constant negative growth by tens of millions of dollars over the past 5 years, so they're clearly not profitable at all.\n\nYou're going to find similar things everywhere you look. Instead of customer-facing features, I'd look at company history, funding partners, staff, etc. None of these services are sustainable currently (just funded by venture capital + rich people), so discussions of customer-facing price to me feel arbitrary. If that's all you care about though, then I'm sure others can give you recommendations of what \\*they've\\* used (though I doubt anyone has done extensive research, personally).\n\n(Imo, why actors aren't getting educated on how models work + how one might make one locally is beyond me. That's really the only way to \"own\" your voice. We need more tech-savvy people in the VO community.)\n\nTL;DR - There is no \"best\" unless you're thinking short-term gains. Look into creating locally or vet the hell out of services.\n\n### Comment ID l6ct59d with +2 score by [(MaesterJones, Reddit, 2024-05-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceActing/comments/1d48gw6/voice_artists_who_have_ai_model_best_model_out/l6ct59d/) (in reply to ID l6cplbb):\nGreat points, thanks for the reply. \n\n>I see they're a child company of Veritone,\n\nAh, I have a meeting with these guys next week. This is the *one* name of the company I wrote down in my notes. \n\n>I'd look at company history, funding partners, staff\n\nI'll see what can be dug up. \n\n>There is no \"best\" unless you're thinking short-term gains. Look into creating locally or vet the hell out of services.\n\nIt's the wild west out there. Companies could collapse next year, or be bought out by competitors. I  wish I had the know how to create my own algorithm, but that is far beyond my technical knowledge lol. Vetting is part of the reason I'm here. Wanted to see if any of you had 1st hand experience that I can consider in addition to what's on the web. \n\nI see and hear about lower end jobs that are getting swept away by AI. My goal is to hopefully capitalize on this, and maybe grab a small piece of the market, positioning myself to be the best of both worlds for the client. This is all new, it's all untested, and I'm not planning on jumping on board soon, but I do think there is opportunity here. \n\nThanks again for your input!\n\n#### Comment ID l6fqwl6 with +2 score by [(ReluctantToast777, Reddit, 2024-05-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceActing/comments/1d48gw6/voice_artists_who_have_ai_model_best_model_out/l6fqwl6/) (in reply to ID l6ct59d):\nYeah, totally makes sense to scope things out!\n\nNot sure which questions are allowed in your meeting, but I would be curious to know how transparent + truthful they end up being with their sourcing + business operations. At the end of the day, they can disclose whatever they want I suppose, but the more transparency, the better imo. I'm assuming most potential clients don't dig into those kinds of questions anyway, lol.\n\n\"Wild West\" is 100% accurate. It's a bummer SAG-AFTRA gave up so easily when we haven't established regulations nor frameworks for getting, at the very least, local models created, so actors have innately more leverage overall. You would think there would be \\*some\\* guidance as to who is reputable/trustworthy amidst the sea of terrible + predatory services out there. But nah, they just decided to partner with a random company (aka Replica) that could \\*maybe\\* give them more leverage for the IMA, lol. (Mini-rant over, XD)\n\nI'm personally trying to find the time to research model creation myself (software development is my day job), just so I can help contribute to the guidance that \\*should\\* already exist. But we'll see how it goes!",

They have a AI operating system (aiWare) that is designed to boost performance in several industries by transforming audio/visual/text sources into actionable intelligence. \n\nFor example, they recently announced integration of their Energy AI with NVIDIA’s EGX AI platform:\n\n[https://investors.veritone.com/news/press-release-details/2021/Veritone-Announces-Energy-AI-Integration-with-NVIDIAs-EGX-AI-Platform/default.aspx](https://investors.veritone.com/news/press-release-details/2021/Veritone-Announces-Energy-AI-Integration-with-NVIDIAs-EGX-AI-Platform/default.aspx)\n\nThey have also recently announced partnerships with Alteryx and a six year agreement with a company called Extreme E:\n\n[https://investors.veritone.com/news/press-release-details/2021/Veritone-and-Alteryx-Announce-Strategic-Relationship-to-Power-the-Alteryx-Analytic-Process-Automation-Platform-With-New-Advanced-AI-Capabilities/default.aspx](https://investors.veritone.com/news/press-release-details/2021/Veritone-and-Alteryx-Announce-Strategic-Relationship-to-Power-the-Alteryx-Analytic-Process-Automation-Platform-With-New-Advanced-AI-Capabilities/default.aspx)\n\n[https://investors.veritone.com/news/press-release-details/2021/Veritone-and-Base-Media-Cloud-Announce-Six-Year-Agreement-with-Extreme-E-to-Enable-Global-Content-Distribution-and-Instant-Accessibility/default.aspx](https://investors.veritone.com/news/press-release-details/2021/Veritone-and-Base-Media-Cloud-Announce-Six-Year-Agreement-with-Extreme-E-to-Enable-Global-Content-Distribution-and-Instant-Accessibility/default.aspx)\n\nThis is old news, but the company has already partnered with Microsoft by launching its operating system on Azure government:\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190911005171/en/Veritone-Launches-aiWARE™-on-Microsoft-Azure-Government-to-Further-AI-Adoption-by-Government-Agencies](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190911005171/en/Veritone-Launches-aiWARE™-on-Microsoft-Azure-Government-to-Further-AI-Adoption-by-Government-Agencies)\n\nI realize that this industry is very speculative, and the company is not turning a profit yet, but things are looking pretty bullish imo. The company is not holding any considerable debt and they have seen increasing revenue over the past 4 years. The recent partnerships are in a variety of industries. To me, this shows the ability for wide adoption of the aiWARE operating system and considerable future potential growth. \n\nIn the short term, earnings for the company is coming up on March 5th. Looking at the options chain for March 19th, there is quite a bit of call volume at the $50 strike price. The stock price was $36.05 at close on Friday...\n\nDoes anyone know of other companies that have similar products? Who is their competition?\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on VERI. I plan to scoop up some share before earnings.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID gp8e51w with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-02-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lunhvj/curious_about_peoples_thoughts_on_veritone_inc/gp8e51w/) (in reply to ID lunhvj):\nI got in over the summer when their price had been hammered. I’m excited about their deal with NVdia. I think they are righting the ship. I’ve seen them hiring some brilliant people in last six months in linked in. I think some of the negativity out there was because they culled some folks. But I see good things ahead for them.\n\nI’m holding long term as I bought in so low. I think they’re doing solar stuff as well. I had more hope around that front because of current admin, but don’t think solar is going to be the big deal everyone thought it would under Biden. Stocks like Cwen went up with Biden election, but now back in mid 20’s even with their great dividend yield. So have more hope with them and NVdia. I think that could be a good match for both of them.",

Is it worth the money? Do you find the switch allows you to do more with your set up without a million pedals/changing instruments?\n\nI have a Les Paul, Stratocaster, Sg and a McCarty PRS (the push pull pots on the McCarty are what's getting me interested in veritone switch) I am going to add a semi/hollow body guitar to my guitar collection and need some opinions. \n\n\nIn my search I fell in love with the Epiphone Lucille .The binding and hardware is beautiful and the guitar has got flash. Most of all, it's the SOUND on every review video that sets it apart for me.\n \nThis would be my first Epiphone purchase and it's a hefty price tag in comparison to other Epiphone instruments. \n\nThat's why I want to ask anyone who has experience with hollow body's because videos are designed to sell products.\n\nI have yet to play one, which could sink the boat if I hate the feel, but i wanted to ask y'all if you had any opinions on this instrument?  if you have a semi/hollow body that is your go to?

The Lucille can be a bit heavier than a 335 type.\n\nThe Varitone has  uses but many players set it to the 'bypass' position.   It's mostly found on Gibson ES-345 and sometimes ES-355 models plus the Lucille.\n\nIt's more than a tone control, which just uses a capacitor to roll high frequencies off.  Varitones include an inductor or choke with capacitors to subtract some specific frequencies.\n\nNote that some of the classic guitars the Varitone was used on, also had the pickups out of phase.\n\nThis video has an explanation and demonstration using a Gibson ES-345:\n\n[https://youtu.be/hAHm7X8xmp4?si=2gnuLn5FGyd4pVp1](https://youtu.be/hAHm7X8xmp4?si=2gnuLn5FGyd4pVp1)\n\nAnd the lovely and talented Chris Buck demoing a varitone:\n\n[https://youtu.be/YENmNQh-SEA?si=uhmzGXPRxAbw7kTd](https://youtu.be/YENmNQh-SEA?si=uhmzGXPRxAbw7kTd)\n\nThe thread at this link includes a wiring diagram:\n\n[https://forum.gibson.com/topic/127119-varitone-wiring/](https://forum.gibson.com/topic/127119-varitone-wiring/)\n\nFor myself, the semi-hollow I used for some years is a 1973 Guild Starfire IV.   My last gig involved a 2003 Gretsch Anniversary, which is a wonderful guitar.   Have not gigged with my 335.\n\nMost of the time right now I have on hand a somewhat abused 61 reissue Epi Casino,  made in China but assembled in Nashville with US electronics.  Traded an Epi Wildkat that I never bonded with.   The Casino fell out of favour by the early-mid 1960's as stage volumes rose.  Being fully hollow, feedback is a real issue in that circumstance, but otherwise it's an excellent guitar.\n\n### Comment ID kwbv5yx with +2 score by [(mmfm1984, Reddit, 2024-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kwbv5yx/) (in reply to ID kw9unjv):\nThanks!!\n\n## Comment ID kw9bb4p with +4 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-03-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kw9bb4p/) (in reply to ID 1bm3skn):\nI played one years ago and liked it. I cant remember the veritone switch, thats probably not something Id personally look. But 335 style guitars are some of my absolute favorites. They are super versatile, you can get grear blues, rock, jazz, country tones, the list goes on. Its got a short scale like a les paul but they're a lot easier on the back.\n\n## Comment ID kwad4am with +3 score by [(GibsonMaestro, Reddit, 2024-03-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1bm3skn/epiphone_bb_king_lucille_is_it_worth_it/kwad4am/) (in reply to ID 1bm3skn):\nI have an Epi Les Paul Florentine, which is a semi-hollow Les Paul. However, it comes PRObuckers, which I find more dynamic then the Alnico Classic PROs that come in the Lucille. However, it's a routed LP body, and is probably isn't a fair comparison. \n\nI also own a Squier CV Starcaster, which is built more closely to the specs of Lucille, and is very similar to the Lucille. Unplugged, it's loud. Plugged in, it's no different than a solid body, and you'll find the same with Lucille. \n\nA semi-hollow has the pickups installed directly into the center block, and is essentially a 2x4 electric guitar with hollow wings.

Supposedly tuning stability is an issue with bigsbys, along with restringing but the Ubukata 335 uses slightly longer string pegs on the bigsby which makes restringing easier. If you have tuning stability issues it's my understanding that you can lubricate string contact points with pencil graphite (nut and bridge saddles) and this usually fixes it. As for weight, imo even with a bigsby and veritone I don't feel like the Ubukata is that heavy (supposedly it's around 23 extra ounces when you add both the bigsby and veritone which imo is basically nothing compared to the overall weight of a guitar). Since it's my understanding you already bought the GC Epiphone it probably doesn't matter too much though, they're both great guitars imo although the Ubukata is more \"exclusive\" if that's something you care about.\n\n## Comment ID m4p0meo with +1 score by [(MyNameisMayco, Reddit, 2024-12-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1hq61bx/fomo_epiphone_shinichi_ubukata_vs_epiphone/m4p0meo/) (in reply to ID 1hq61bx):\nNever spend more than $400 on an epiphone\n\n### Comment ID m4p0t2q with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-12-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1hq61bx/fomo_epiphone_shinichi_ubukata_vs_epiphone/m4p0t2q/) (in reply to ID m4p0meo):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID m4p0zdn with +1 score by [(MyNameisMayco, Reddit, 2024-12-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1hq61bx/fomo_epiphone_shinichi_ubukata_vs_epiphone/m4p0zdn/) (in reply to ID m4p0t2q):\nMy case is completely the opposite.

No matter how well you do, or how far above and beyond you go they do not care and they won't recognize you.

Put hours of work in to something your supervisor thinks is a good idea and it falls by the wayside. Running in circles and chasing your tail never having true deadlines or guidance for that matter is exhausting and you're never truly at a point where you can exhale.

I found that there was a lack of support when trying to learn and progress in the company. Beyond that, I found that most people including myself were very overworked with no end in sight. The client comes first attitude can be problematic when the team says yes to a request without the resources needed behind the scenes to make it happen or happen in a timely fashion. Yes, the company has seen a lot of growth, but from my experience being a part of that you feel out of touch with the rewards of that growth. Just a hamster wheel and not enough comradery interally to make it feel worth it. Expect long hours with little support to alleviate you, because everyone else is working long hours as well. Personally this job drove my mental health into the ground. That’s just my personal experience and I’m sure there are others who find it to be a great place to work. I just highly doubt employees are as happy as it appears on Glassdoor.",

Good benefits are key to me, and Veritone has put a lot of effort this past year into providing Top Tier benefits while absorbing most of the cost (up to 80%). Having worked or interviewed with similar sized companies (under 1000 employees) over the past decade, it's refreshing to see a company not make you pay for 50% of the fast rising US healthcare costs. Since I am married with a few kids, it's putting hundreds of dollars per month back in my pocket. Plus ESSP and 401k match programs have ramped up, which are benefits I haven't been offered in years.",

Then they yell at everyone to do work faster / sooner even though they oversold it.\n- CEO only cares about the stock price because he has millions of shares of stock. Unfortunately, stock price is in the tank, which means trying to take “big swings” at growing the company thru acquisitions and/or business pivots, abandoning many of the people and clients who helped them get to where they are today.\n- furloughs and layoffs are rampant.

Many good engineers were let go after working on bad projects despite being better than engineers who happened to be on other projects.

The client comes first attitude can be problematic when the team says yes to a request without the resources needed behind the scenes to make it happen or happen in a timely fashion. Yes, the company has seen a lot of growth, but from my experience being a part of that you feel out of touch with the rewards of that growth. Just a hamster wheel and not enough comradery interally to make it feel worth it. Expect long hours with little support to alleviate you, because everyone else is working long hours as well. Personally this job drove my mental health into the ground. That’s just my personal experience and I’m sure there are others who find it to be a great place to work.

Good benefits are key to me, and Veritone has put a lot of effort this past year into providing Top Tier benefits while absorbing most of the cost (up to 80%). Having worked or interviewed with similar sized companies (under 1000 employees) over the past decade, it's refreshing to see a company not make you pay for 50% of the fast rising US healthcare costs. Since I am married with a few kids, it's putting hundreds of dollars per month back in my pocket.

(NASDAQ:VERI), a leader in designing human-centered AI solutions, today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“The divestiture of Veritone One marks a defining moment in our company's evolution, positioning us as a pure-play enterprise AI company at a pivotal time in the technology landscape,\" said Ryan Steelberg, Chief Executive Officer of Veritone. “With over 3,000 existing customers across Commercial and Public Sectors, we're now poised to capitalize on the unprecedented growth in the AI solutions market. As we look toward 2025, we're energized by our streamlined operational focus and enhanced ability to invest in innovation that will truly differentiate Veritone in the enterprise AI marketplace.”\n\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\n\nRevenue of $22.0 million, a decrease of 21% compared to Q3 2023.\n\nSoftware Products and Services revenues of $14.7 million, a decrease of 28% compared to $20.4 million in Q3 2023 driven by expected declines in consumption- based revenue customers, including Amazon and declines in one-time non-recurring software revenue.\n\nManaged Services revenue of $7.3 million as compared to $7.6 million in Q3 2023.\n\nTotal Software Products & Services Customers of 3,291, down 7% year over year, as compared to September 30, 2023, largely driven by Commercial Enterprise, which began sunsetting legacy Career Builder customers following the June 2023 acquisition of Broadbean, offset by an increase across Public Sector from growth in public safety customers.\n\nTotal New Bookings of $16.5 million, up 17% sequentially from Q2 2024 and 6% year over year, as compared to Q3 2023.\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) (as defined below) of $63.3 million, down from $89.3 million in Q3 2023 driven by declines in consumption-based revenue, including Amazon, offset by a slight increase from recurring subscription-based SaaS revenue customers.\n\nNet loss from Continuing Operations of $22.5 million, as compared to a loss of $26.7 million in Q3 2023 driven by lower overall operating expenses resulting from our past cost reduction plans and offset by decline in revenue.\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit of $15.7 million, a decrease of 25% or $5.3 million as compared to Q3 2023 primarily due to the decline in revenue.\n\nNon-GAAP gross margins of 71.2% as compared to 74.9% in Q3 2023.\n\nNet Loss of $21.7 million, as compared to $24.5 million in Q3 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP Net Loss of $7.1 million, which was relatively flat as compared to Q3 2023.\n\nDivestiture of Veritone One, LLC\n\nThrough October 17, 2024 (the “Divestiture Closing Date”), we operated Veritone One, LLC (“Veritone One”), a full-service advertising agency, to provide differentiated Managed Services to our customers. On October 17, 2024, we sold all of the issued and outstanding equity of Veritone One to an affiliate of Insignia Capital Group L.P. (such transaction, the “Divestiture”). Veritone One’s services include media planning and strategy, advertisement buying and placement, campaign messaging, clearance verification and attribution, and custom analytics, specializing in host-endorsed and influencer advertising across primarily radio, podcasting, streaming audio, social media and other digital media channels. We determined that the Divestiture represents a strategic shift that will have a material effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, the historical financial results of Veritone One are reflected in this earnings release as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented on a retrospective basis, unless otherwise stated.\n\nAbout Our Sales Pipeline\n\nOur sales pipeline represents revenue we expect to receive based on the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts outstanding at the end of the quarter and contracts that we believe have a high probability of closing in the next three to twelve months. We include in our sales pipeline fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term and we do not include any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services) and any fees payable after contract renewals or extensions that are at the discretion of our customer. Many of our contracts require us to provide services over more than one year and may include professional fees required to enable our technology in certain environments we do not host or have direct control over. In some cases, our customers may have the ability to terminate our agreements on short notice and our pipeline does not consider the potential impact of any early termination. No assurance can be given that we will ultimately realize our full sales pipeline.\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nSeptember 30,\n\nNine Months Ended\n\nSeptember 30,\n\nUnaudited\n\nPercent\n\nPercent\n\n(in $000s)\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\nChange\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\nChange\n\nRevenue\n\n$\n\n21,993\n\n$\n\n27,968\n\n(21\n\n)%\n\n$\n\n70,204\n\n$\n\n72,883\n\n(4\n\n)%\n\nLoss from operations\n\n$\n\n(22,492\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(25,183\n\n)\n\n11\n\n%\n\n$\n\n(67,167\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(79,773\n\n)\n\n16\n\n%\n\nNet loss from continuing operations\n\n$\n\n(22,511\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(26,732\n\n)\n\n16\n\n%\n\n$\n\n(72,072\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(76,012\n\n)\n\n5\n\n%\n\nNet loss\n\n$\n\n(21,746\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(24,541\n\n)\n\n11\n\n%\n\n$\n\n(69,175\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(70,800\n\n)\n\n2\n\n%\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit*\n\n$\n\n15,668\n\n$\n\n20,942\n\n(25\n\n)%\n\n$\n\n50,590\n\n$\n\n51,502\n\n(2\n\n)%\n\nNon-GAAP net loss from continuing operations*\n\n$\n\n(11,097\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(10,411\n\n)\n\n(7\n\n)%\n\n$\n\n(31,139\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(36,833\n\n)\n\n15\n\n%\n\nNon-GAAP net loss*\n\n$\n\n(7,113\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(7,943\n\n)\n\n10\n\n%\n\n$\n\n(21,579\n\n)\n\n$\n\n(30,523\n\n)\n\n29\n\n%\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nSeptember 30,\n\nNine Months Ended\n\nSeptember 30,\n\nUnaudited\n\nPercent\n\nPercent\n\n(in $000s, except customers)\n\n2024\n\n2023(1)\n\nChange\n\n2024\n\n2023(1)\n\nChange\n\nSoftware Products & Services\n\nSoftware Revenue*\n\n$\n\n14,694\n\n$\n\n20,361\n\n(28\n\n)%\n\n$\n\n45,549\n\n$\n\n63,643\n\n(28\n\n)%\n\nTotal Software Products & Services Customers(2)\n\n3,291\n\n3,536\n\n(7\n\n)%\n\n3,291\n\n3,536\n\n(7\n\n)%\n\nAnnual Recurring Revenue(3)*\n\n$\n\n63,280\n\n$\n\n89,299\n\n(29\n\n)%\n\n$\n\n63,280\n\n$\n\n89,299\n\n(29\n\n)%\n\nTotal New Bookings(4)\n\n$\n\n16,471\n\n$\n\n15,501\n\n6\n\n%\n\n$\n\n16,471\n\n$\n\n15,501\n\n6\n\n%\n\nGross Revenue Retention(5)\n\n>90%\n\n>90%\n\n>90%\n\n>90%\n\n(1)All of the supplemental financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects the historical information of Veritone combined with the historical information of Broadbean (as defined below) as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of (i) all of the issued and outstanding share capital of (a) Broadbean Technology Pty Ltd ACN 116 011 959 / ABN 79 116 011 959, a limited company incorporated under the laws of Australia, (b) Broadbean Technology Limited, a limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, (c) Broadbean, Inc., a Delaware corporation and (d) CareerBuilder France S.A.R.L., a limited liability company organized (société à responsabilité limitée) under the laws of France, and (ii) certain assets and liabilities related thereto (the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) together, “Broadbean”) on June 13, 2023.\n\n(2)“Total Software Products & Services Customers” includes Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each respective quarter set forth above with net revenues in excess of $10 and also excludes any customers categorized by us as trial or pilot status. In prior periods, we provided “Ending Software Customers,” which represented Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each fiscal quarter with trailing twelve-month revenues in excess of $2,400 for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. and/or deemed by Veritone to be under an active contract for the applicable periods. Total Software Products & Services Customers is not comparable to Ending Software Customers. Total Software Products & Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve month basis and excludes any customers that are on trial or pilot status with us rather than including customers with active contracts. Management uses Total Software Products & Services Customers and we believe Total Software Products & Services Customers are useful to investors because it more accurately reflects our total customers for our Software Products & Services inclusive of Broadbean.\n\n(3) “Annual Recurring Revenue” is calculated as Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), which is an annualized calculation of the monthly recurring revenue in the last month of the calculated quarter for all active Software Products & Services customers, combined with Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), which is the trailing twelve month calculation of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Software Products & Services customers. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue reflects the historical information of Veritone combined with the historical information of Broadbean as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022 where indicated, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenues.\n\n(4)“Total New Bookings” represents the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts received in the quarter (including fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term), excluding any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services).\n\n(5) “Gross Revenue Retention” represents our dollar-based gross retention rate as of the period end by starting with the revenue from Software Products & Services Customers as of the 3 months in the prior year quarter to such period, or Prior Year Quarter Revenue. We then deduct from the Prior Year Quarter Revenue any revenue from Software Products & Services Customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue. We then divide the total Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue by the total Prior Year Quarter Revenue to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of revenue from all Software Products & Services Customers from our Software Products & Services as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn. All numbers used to determine Gross Revenue Retention are calculated reflecting the acquisition of Broadbean as if the acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2022.\n\n* See tables below for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to directly comparable GAAP measures and for the definitions used for Software Products & Services Supplemental Financial Information.\n\nRecent Business Highlights\n\nPublic Sector\n\nClosed 13 new public safety and government customers, including the Department of Justice - Office of Public Affairs.\n\nSigned agreements with two of the largest counties in Southern California and a state-wide law enforcement agency.\n\nExpanded market reach with new strategic partnerships, including Nuix and international conglomerate, Getac.\n\nCommercial Enterprise\n\nSigned multi-year agreement with iHeartMedia, for expansion across their 850+ stations, enabling seamless and analytical process and review of unstructured audio data in near-real time.\n\nSecured AWS Media and Entertainment Services Competency in Media Supply Chain and Data Science & Analytics, recognizing our specialized expertise, technical proficiency and proven success in helping customers transform their media and entertainment operations with innovative cloud-based AI solutions.\n\nSigned agreement with E.W.

Software Products & Services revenue of $14.7 million decreased by $5.7 million or 28% year over year driven by expected declines in Commercial Enterprise principally from consumption based customers, including Amazon and one-time software revenue in Q3 2023 that did not recur in Q3 2024. Managed Services revenue of $7.3 million was relatively flat when compared to $7.6 million in Q3 2023.\n\nNet loss from continuing operations was $22.5 million improving $4.42 million as compared to $26.7 million in the third quarter of 2023, driven by the year over year improvement in loss from operations, coupled with a $1.6 million higher tax benefit from income in Q3 2024 as compared to Q3 2023. Non-GAAP net loss of $7.1 million decreased by 10% when compared to Non-GAAP net loss of $7.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, largely driven by the decline in Non-GAAP gross profit, which was partially offset by cost reductions enacted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Total Software Product & Services Customers of 3,291 was down 7% year over year relative to Total Software Product & Services Customers as of September 30, 2023, principally due to declines in Commercial Enterprise from planned migration of legacy CareerBuilder customers off the Broadbean software platform, offset by increases in Public Sector. Total New Bookings increased by 6% to $16.5 million versus the comparable period a year ago largely driven by an increase in subscription-based customer bookings, offset by a reduction in revenue from consumption-based customers, including Amazon. Annual Recurring Revenue of $63.3 million decreased 29% year over year driven in large part by the declines in Commercial Enterprise consumption spending from customers, offset by a slight increase year over year increase in Annual Recurring Revenue from subscription-based SaaS customers.\n\nBusiness Outlook\n\nFull Year 2024\n\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $92.5 million to $93.5 million, as compared to $100.0 million for the full year of 2023\n\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $(37.5) million to $(36.5) million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $(45.5) million for the full year of 2023.\n\nFull Year 2025\n\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $107.0 million to $122.0 million, as compared to the midpoint of $93.0 million for fiscal 2024.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $(25.0) million to $(15.0) million, compared to non-GAAP net loss midpoint of $(37.0) million for fiscal 2024.\n\nThese updated financial guidance ranges supersede any previously disclosed financial guidance and investors should not rely on any previously disclosed financial guidance.\n\nConference Call\n\nVeritone will hold a conference call to deliver management’s prepared remarks on November 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (5:30 a.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its third quarter 2024 results, provide an update on the business and conduct a question-and-answer session.

The Company also provides certain key performance indicators (KPIs), including Total Software Products & Services Customers, Annual Recurring Revenue, Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), Total New Bookings and Gross Revenue Retention. The Company has posted additional supplemental financial information on its website at investors.veritone.com concurrently with this press release.\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as Non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, respectively, is the Company’s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, adjusted to exclude provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of warrant liability, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, interest income, interest expense, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition and due diligence costs, gain on sale of energy group, contribution of business held for sale, variable consultant performance bonus expense, and severance and executive transition costs. The items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a breakdown of GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and these excluded items, are detailed in the reconciliations included following the financial statements attached to this news release. In addition, following the financial statements attached to this news release, the Company has provided additional supplemental non-GAAP measures of operating expenses, loss from operations, other income (expense), net, and loss before income taxes, excluding the items excluded from non-GAAP net loss as noted above, and reconciling such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\nThe Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures and KPIs because management believes such information to be important supplemental measures of performance that are commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. Management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other financial measures so calculated and presented, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Other companies (including the Company’s competitors) may define these non-GAAP financial measures differently. The non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the historical operating results of Veritone or predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn addition, the Company defines the following capitalized terms in this news release as follows:\n\nCore Operations consists of the Company’s aiWARE operating platform of software, SaaS and related services; content licensing and representation services; and their supporting operations, including direct costs of sales as well as operating expenses for sales, marketing and product development and certain general and administrative costs dedicated to these operations.\n\nCorporate principally consists of general and administrative functions such as executive, finance, legal, people operations, fixed overhead expenses (including facilities and information technology expenses), other income (expenses) and taxes, and other expenses that support the entire Company, including public company driven costs.\n\nSoftware Products & Services consists of revenues generated from commercial enterprise and government and regulated industries customers using our aiWARE platform and Hiring Solutions, any related support and maintenance services, and any related professional services associated with the deployment and/or implementation of such solutions.\n\nManaged Services consist of revenues generated from commercial enterprise customers using our content licensing and representation services and supporting operations.\n\nAbout Veritone\n\nVeritone (NASDAQ: VERI) builds human-centered enterprise AI solutions.

In addition, words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “outlook,” “should,” “could,” “estimate,” “confident” or “continue” or the plural, negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements, and any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and are based on management’s current assumptions, expectations, beliefs and information. As such, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement as a result of various factors. Important factors that could cause such differences include, among other things, our operations and financial results after the sale of Veritone One; our ability to continue as a going concern; our ability to expand our aiWARE SaaS business; declines or limited growth in the market for AI-based software applications and concerns over the use of AI that may hinder the adoption of AI technologies; our requirements for additional capital and liquidity to support our operations, our business growth, service our debt obligations and refinance maturing debt obligations, and the availability of such capital on acceptable terms, if at all; our reliance upon a limited number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue; declines in customers’ usage of our products and other offerings; our ability to realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures, and other planned or ongoing cost-saving measures, including our ability to successfully integrate our recent acquisition of Broadbean; our identification of existing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; fluctuations in our results over time; the impact of seasonality on our business; our ability to manage our growth, including through acquisitions and expansion into international markets; our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance and keep pace with technological developments; actions by our competitors, partners and others that may block us from using third party technologies in our aiWARE platform, offering it for free to the public or making it cost prohibitive to continue to incorporate such technologies into our platform; interruptions, performance problems or security issues with our technology and infrastructure, or that of our third party service providers; the impact of the continuing economic disruption caused by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the war in Israel, financial instability, high interest rates, inflationary pressures and the responses by central banking authorities to control inflation, monetary supply shifts and the threat of recession in the United States and around the world on our business operations and those of our existing and potential customers; and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control.

supplemental financial information as a lookback of prior years to explain our recent historical and year-over-year performance.\n\nSoftware Products & Services Supplemental Financial Information\n\n(1) All of the supplemental financial information for this period reflects the historical information of Veritone combined with the historical information of Broadbean as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.\n\n(2) “Pro Forma Software Revenue” is a non-GAAP measure that represents Software Products & Services revenue as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.\n\n(3) “Total Software Products & Services Customers” includes Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each respective quarter set forth above with net revenues in excess of $10 and also excludes any customers categorized by us as trial or pilot status. In prior periods, we provided “Ending Software Customers,” which represented Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each fiscal quarter with trailing twelve-month revenues in excess of $2,400 for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. and/or deemed by the Company to be under an active contract for the applicable periods. Total Software Products & Services Customers is not comparable to Ending Software Customers. Total Software Products & Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve-month basis. Total Software Products & Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve-month basis and excludes any customers that are on trial or pilot status with us rather than including customers with active contracts. Management uses Total Software Products & Services Customers and we believe Total Software Products & Services Customers are useful to investors because it more accurately reflects our total customers for our Software Products & Services customers inclusive of Broadbean.\n\n(4) “Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)” represents an annualized calculation of monthly recurring revenue during the last month of the applicable quarter for all Total Software Products & Services customers, in each case as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue (SaaS). Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) includes only subscription-based SaaS revenue, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and more volatile Consumption revenues.\n\n(5) “Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption)” represents the trailing twelve months of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Total Software Products & Services customers, in each case, as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) includes only non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption)” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and more volatile Consumption revenues.\n\n(6) “Total New Bookings” represents the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts received in the quarter (including fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term), excluding any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services), in each case as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.\n\n(7) “Gross Revenue Retention” represents a calculation of our dollar-based gross revenue retention rate as of the period end by starting with the revenue from Software Products & Services Customers as of the 3 months in the prior year quarter to such period, or Prior Year Quarter Revenue. We then deduct from the Prior Year Quarter Revenue any revenue from Software Products & Services Customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue. We then divide the total Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue by the total Prior Year Quarter Revenue to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of revenue from all Software Products & Services Customers from our Software Products & Services as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn. All numbers used to determine Gross Revenue Retention are calculated as if Veritone had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. Veritone completed its acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023.\n\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliation of revenue to pro forma revenue and the calculation of pro forma annual recurring revenue.\n\nQuarter Ended\n\nMar 31,\n\nJun 30,\n\nSept 30,\n\nDec 31,\n\nMar 31,\n\nJun 30,\n\nSept 30,\n\nDec 31,\n\nMar 31,\n\nJun 30,\n\nSep 30,\n\n2022\n\n2022\n\n2022\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2023\n\n2023\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2024\n\n2024\n\nSoftware Products & Services Revenue (in 000’s)\n\n$\n\n18,167\n\n$\n\n18,379\n\n$\n\n20,812\n\n$\n\n27,220\n\n$\n\n14,127\n\n$\n\n14,093\n\n$\n\n20,361\n\n$\n\n19,820\n\n$\n\n15,220\n\n$\n\n15,632\n\n$\n\n14,694\n\nBroadbean Revenue (in 000’s) (1)\n\n6,204\n\n6,974\n\n7,639\n\n8,230\n\n8,156\n\n8,374\n\n8,739\n\n8,662\n\n8,517\n\n8,690\n\n8,169\n\nBroadbean Revenue included in Software Products & Services Revenue (in 000’s)\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n(1,716\n\n)\n\n(8,739\n\n)\n\n(8,662\n\n)\n\n(8,517\n\n)\n\n(8,690\n\n)\n\n(8,169\n\n)\n\nPro Forma Software Revenue (in 000’s)\n\n$\n\n24,371\n\n$\n\n25,353\n\n$\n\n28,451\n\n$\n\n35,450\n\n$\n\n22,283\n\n$\n\n20,751\n\n$\n\n20,361\n\n$\n\n19,820\n\n$\n\n15,220\n\n$\n\n15,632\n\n$\n\n14,694\n\nManaged Services Revenue (in 000’s)\n\n16,240\n\n15,856\n\n16,384\n\n16,670\n\n16,136\n\n13,874\n\n14,772\n\n14,377\n\n16,416\n\n15,360\n\n7,299\n\nTotal Pro Forma Revenue (in 000’s)\n\n$\n\n40,611\n\n$\n\n41,209\n\n$\n\n44,835\n\n$\n\n52,120\n\n$\n\n38,419\n\n$\n\n34,625\n\n$\n\n35,133\n\n$\n\n34,197\n\n$\n\n31,636\n\n$\n\n30,992\n\n$\n\n21,993\n\nTrailing Twelve Months Ended\n\nMar 31,\n\nJun 30,\n\nSept 30,\n\nDec 31,\n\nMar 31,\n\nJun 30,\n\nSept 30,\n\nDec 31,\n\nMar 31,\n\nJun 30,\n\nSep 30,\n\n2022\n\n2022\n\n2022\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2023\n\n2023\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2024\n\n2024\n\nSoftware Products & Services Revenue (in 000’s)\n\n$\n\n72,997\n\n$\n\n85,796\n\n$\n\n97,581\n\n$\n\n84,578\n\n$\n\n80,538\n\n$\n\n76,252\n\n$\n\n75,801\n\n$\n\n68,401\n\n$\n\n69,494\n\n$\n\n71,033\n\n$\n\n65,366\n\nBroadbean Revenue (in 000’s) (1)\n\n29,599\n\n30,006\n\n30,136\n\n29,047\n\n30,999\n\n32,399\n\n33,499\n\n33,931\n\n34,292\n\n34,608\n\n34,038\n\nBroadbean Revenue included in Software Products & Services Revenue (in 000’s)\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n(1,716\n\n)\n\n(10,455\n\n)\n\n(19,117\n\n)\n\n(27,634\n\n)\n\n(34,608\n\n)\n\n(34,038\n\n)\n\nPro Forma Software Revenue (in 000’s)\n\n$\n\n102,596\n\n$\n\n115,802\n\n$\n\n127,717\n\n$\n\n113,625\n\n$\n\n111,537\n\n$\n\n106,935\n\n$\n\n98,845\n\n$\n\n83,215\n\n$\n\n76,152\n\n$\n\n71,033\n\n$\n\n65,366\n\nManaged Services Revenue (in 000’s)\n\n58,419\n\n60,546\n\n63,406\n\n65,150\n\n65,046\n\n63,064\n\n61,452\n\n59,159\n\n59,439\n\n60,925\n\n53,452\n\nTotal Pro Forma Revenue (in 000’s)\n\n$\n\n161,015\n\n$\n\n176,348\n\n$\n\n191,123\n\n$\n\n178,775\n\n$\n\n176,583\n\n$\n\n169,999\n\n$\n\n160,297\n\n$\n\n142,374\n\n$\n\n135,591\n\n$\n\n131,958\n\n$\n\n118,818\n\nPro Forma Total Number of Customers\n\n3,673\n\n3,718\n\n3,787\n\n3,824\n\n3,773\n\n3,705\n\n3,536\n\n3,459\n\n3,384\n\n3,437\n\n3,291\n\nPro Forma Annual Recurring Revenue (in 000’s) (2)\n\n$\n\n135,837\n\n$\n\n130,366\n\n$\n\n129,016\n\n$\n\n118,002\n\n$\n\n112,695\n\n$\n\n107,949\n\n$\n\n89,299\n\n$\n\n80,089\n\n$\n\n72,574\n\n$\n\n67,924\n\n$\n\n63,280\n\n(1) “Pro Forma Software Revenue” includes historical Software Products & Services Revenue from the past eleven (11) fiscal quarters of each of Veritone, Inc. and Broadbean and presents such revenue on a combined basis treating Broadbean as owned by Veritone, Inc. since January 1, 2022.\n\n(2) “Pro Forma Annual Recurring Revenue” represents an annualized calculation of the monthly recurring revenue in the last period of the calculated quarter, combined with the trailing twelve month calculation for all non-recurring and/or consumption based revenue for all active customers.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241111849905/en/\n\nCompany Contact:\n\nMike Zemetra\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nVeritone, Inc.\n\ninvestors@veritone.com\n\nIR Agency Contact:\n\nCate Goldsmith\n\nProsek Partners\n\n914-815-7678\n\ncgoldsmith@prosek.com\n\nSource: Veritone, Inc.",

Our customer retention and engagement metrics remained strong, highlighted by a 7% year-over-year increase in ARR from subscription-based customers as we work to decrease historical revenue dependencies from consumption-based customers,” said Ryan Steelberg, CEO & President of Veritone. “We demonstrated strong progress against our commitments to right-size our operating structure and strategically align our investments to position Veritone for long-term agility and to serve true customer demand.

Veritone completed its acquisition of (i) all of the issued and outstanding share capital of (a) Broadbean Technology Pty Ltd ACN 116 011 959 / ABN 79 116 011 959, a limited company incorporated under the laws of Australia, (b) Broadbean Technology Limited, a limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, (c) Broadbean, Inc., a Delaware corporation and (d) CareerBuilder France S.A.R.L., a limited liability company organized (société à responsabilité limitée) under the laws of France, and (ii) certain assets and liabilities related thereto (the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) together, “Broadbean”) on June 13, 2023.\n\nRecent Business Highlights\n\nSigned 19 Public Safety & Government customers in the first quarter, which includes three new Federal customers, including a primary state law enforcement agency, intending to use Veritone Redact to automate audio and video redaction workflows, aimed at reducing lengthy manual processes, and addressing their Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request backlog.\n\nAnnounced the launch of Veritone’s AI consulting and services group to address customer and market-driven needs for increased AI enterprise-level services.\n\nVeritone continued its strong advertising momentum, with annual agency bookings growth year over year and signed several new customers, including the largest direct-to-consumer, pet supplies company, Chewy.\n\nSigned over 20 new Media & Entertainment deals in the first quarter, including new deals with Summit Media, the U.S. Soccer Federation, and NBC Universal, and renewals with key customers including Beasley Media Group, Crawford Broadcasting, and Augusta National and upsells with Golf Magazine and Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\nAnnounced a partnership with Grabyo, a leading cloud video platform for live broadcasting, live clipping, and distribution, to streamline live digital content production and leverage AI-driven content management and monetization tools to meet the evolving needs of sports organizations in today’s fast-paced digital landscape.\n\nAchieved AWS Advanced Tier Services status, advancing our AWS Partner capabilities, further accelerating partner driven revenue opportunities, and empowering Veritone to expand and deploy innovative AI solutions.\n\nNamed NAB Product of the Year for the 5th straight year for its recently launched Ask Veri solution, a new Generative AI media intelligence and natural language tool.\n\nReleased feature enhancements to its Advertising and Content Intelligence Suite designed to embrace data privacy while helping to safeguard ad revenues.\n\nQ1 restructuring of organization resulted in over $13.0 million in forecasted annualized cost savings, accelerating non-GAAP net income to as early as Q4 2024.\n\nFinancial Results for Three Months Ended March 31, 2024\n\nDelivered first quarter revenue of $31.6 million, an increase of $1.3 million or 4.3% from $30.3 million in the first quarter of 2023. Software Products & Services revenue of $15.2 million increased $1.1 million or 7.8% year over year driven by the Q2 2023 acquisition of Broadbean, which generated $8.5 million in revenue in Q1 2024, offset by the decline in legacy Veritone Hire revenue over the same period, including Amazon. Managed Services revenue was relatively flat year over year, increasing by $0.3 million, or 1.7%, to $16.4 million.\n\nLoss from operations was $21.8 million as compared to a loss of $23.6 million in Q1 2023 driven in part by a net $2.5 million decrease in operating expense including the impact of the Q2 2023 Broadbean Acquisition, a $1.1 million increase in non-GAAP gross profit driven by higher revenue, and a $0.7 million decline in non-cash depreciation, amortization, and stock based compensation, offset by a $2.5 million increase in severance and transition costs. Non-GAAP gross margin of 77.7% was relatively flat compared to the first quarter of 2023. GAAP net loss was $25.2 million, compared to GAAP net loss of $23.0 million in the first quarter of 2023, driven by an increase of $3.2 million in net interest expense associated with the Company’s December 2023 term loan, which included $1.3 million of non-cash amortization associated with the initial discount and issuance costs of the debt, offset by the $1.8 million decrease in loss from operations. Non-GAAP net loss of $7.6 million decreased by over 20% when compared to non-GAAP net loss of $9.6 million in the first quarter of 2023, largely driven by the increase in non-GAAP gross profit, coupled with reductions in our cost structure since the first quarter of 2023.\n\nDuring Q1 2024, Total Software Product & Services Customers of 3,384 was down 11% year over year on a Pro Forma basis principally due to reductions in legacy Career Builder customers transitioned off our Hire platform following our acquisition of Broadbean. Total New Bookings on a Pro Forma basis decreased by 43.1% to $13.0 million versus the comparable period a year ago largely driven by a reduction in revenue from consumption-based customers, including Amazon. Annual Recurring Revenue on a Pro Forma basis of $72.1 million decreased 36% year over year driven in large part by the decline in consumption spending from customers, offset by 7% year over year increase in subscription-based customers. Excluding the decline in consumption-based spending from Amazon, Software Products & Services revenue growth would have increased over 75% year over year.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $90.7 million, including approximately $73.3 million of cash received from Managed Services clients for future payments to vendors.\n\nBusiness Outlook\n\nSecond Quarter 2024\n\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $31.0 million to $32.0 million, as compared to $30.0 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $5.5 million to $6.5 million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $13.0 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nFull Year 2024\n\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $136.0 million to $142.0 million, as compared to $127.6 million for fiscal 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $11.0 million to $15.0 million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $37.5 million for fiscal 2023.\n\nThese updated financial guidance ranges supersede any previously disclosed financial guidance and investors should not rely on any previously disclosed financial guidance.\n\nConference Call\n\nVeritone will hold a conference call to deliver management’s prepared remarks on Tuesday, May 7, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its first quarter 2024 results, provide an update on the business and conduct a question-and-answer session.

The Company also provides certain key performance indicators (KPIs), including Total Software Products & Services Customers, Annual Recurring Revenue, Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), Total New Bookings and Gross Revenue Retention. The Company has posted additional supplemental financial information on its website at investors.veritone.com concurrently with this press release.\n\nPro Forma Software Revenue represents Software Products & Services revenue on a Pro Forma basis. Non-GAAP gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as Non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, respectively, is the Company’s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, adjusted to exclude provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of warrant liability, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, interest income, interest expense, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition and due diligence costs, gain on sale of energy group, contribution of business held for sale, variable consultant performance bonus expense, and severance and executive transition costs. The items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a breakdown of GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and these excluded items between the Company’s Core Operations and Corporate, are detailed in the reconciliations included following the financial statements attached to this news release. In addition, following the financial statements attached to this news release, the Company has provided additional supplemental non-GAAP measures of operating expenses, loss from operations, other income (expense), net, and loss before income taxes, excluding the items excluded from non-GAAP net loss as noted above, and reconciling such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\nThe Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures and KPIs because management believes such information to be important supplemental measures of performance that are commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. Management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other financial measures so calculated and presented, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Other companies (including the Company’s competitors) may define these non-GAAP financial measures differently. The non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the historical operating results of Veritone or predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn addition, the Company defines the following capitalized terms in this news release as follows:\n\nCore Operations consists of the Company’s aiWARE operating platform of software, SaaS and related services; content licensing and advertising agency services; and their supporting operations, including direct costs of sales as well as operating expenses for sales, marketing and product development and certain general and administrative costs dedicated to these operations.\n\nCorporate principally consists of general and administrative functions such as executive, finance, legal, people operations, fixed overhead expenses (including facilities and information technology expenses), other income (expenses) and taxes, and other expenses that support the entire Company, including public company driven costs.\n\nSoftware Products & Services consists of revenues generated from commercial enterprise and government and regulated industries customers using our aiWARE platform and Hiring Solutions, any related support and maintenance services, and any related professional services associated with the deployment and/or implementation of such solutions.\n\nManaged Services consist of revenues generated from commercial enterprise customers using our content licensing services and advertising agency and related services.\n\nAbout Veritone\n\nVeritone (NASDAQ: VERI) designs human-centered AI solutions.

In addition, words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “outlook,” “should,” “could,” “estimate” or “continue” or the plural, negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements, and any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and are based on management’s current assumptions, expectations, beliefs and information. As such, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement as a result of various factors. Important factors that could cause such differences include, among other things, our ability to expand our aiWARE SaaS business; declines or limited growth in the market for AI-based software applications and concerns over the use of AI that may hinder the adoption of AI technologies; our requirements for additional capital to support our business growth and the availability of such capital on acceptable terms, if at all; our reliance upon a limited number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue, including declines in key customers’ usage of our products and other offerings, our ability to realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions and divestitures, including our ability to successfully integrate our recent acquisition of Broadbean; our identification of existing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; fluctuations in our results over time; the impact of seasonality on our business; our ability to manage our growth, including through acquisitions and our further expansion into international markets; our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance and keep pace with technological developments; actions by our competitors, partners and others that may block us from using the third party technologies in our aiWARE platform, offering it for free to the public or making it cost prohibitive to continue to incorporate such technologies into our platform; interruptions, performance problems or security issues with our technology and infrastructure, or that of our third party service providers; the impact of the continuing economic disruption caused by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the war in Israel, financial instability, inflation rates and the responses by central banking authorities to control inflation, monetary supply shifts and the threat of recession in the United States and around the world on our business operations and those of our existing and potential customers; and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. Certain of these judgments and risks are discussed in more detail in our most recently-filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our most recently-filed Quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and other periodic reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

      "# [Veritone Analyzes U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics April 2024 Jobs Report and AI Job Growth on 2024-05-30](https://investors.veritone.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/323/veritone-analyzes-u-s-bureau-of-labor-statistics-april-2024-jobs-report-and-ai-job-growth)\nData reveals AI job growth and wages are significantly outpacing the general job market\n\nDENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Veritone, Inc. (NASDAQ: VERI), a leader in designing human-centered AI solutions, today released its analysis of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) April 2024 Jobs Report, which provides insights into the latest employment trends and market dynamics shaping the U.S. labor market. Leveraging data from Aspen Technology Labs, Inc., a global leader in web data management services and recruitment technology, Veritone also analyzed AI job growth over the past year.\n\nAccording to the April BLS report, total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 175,000, compared to 303,000 in March 2024, and the unemployment rate was relatively unchanged at 3.9%, with job gains occurring in health care, social assistance, transportation and warehousing similar to the trends observed in March. Additionally, the average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.2% to $34.75, mirroring the slight uptick reported in March.\n\nTo explore how AI jobs compare to the BLS aggregate, Veritone analyzed Aspen Tech Labs’ Job Market Pulse, a real-time database that includes more than 5 million U.S. jobs from more than 112,000 employers. In April 2024, there were 14,117 vacancies in artificial intelligence jobs, a 32% increase year-over-year. The median salary for AI jobs in April was $160,056, or $76.95 hourly, an increase from $144,986, or $69.70, during the same period last year.\n\n\"With increased scrutiny about jobs being replaced by AI, we wanted to dig into how many jobs AI is creating, to provide greater insight into the positive impact of AI on U.S. jobs,” said Alex Fourlis, general manager, Veritone Hire, Veritone. “The April data shows that the AI job market is growing much faster than the overall job market, indicating robust demand for AI expertise. Wages and wage growth in the AI sector also significantly outpace the general job market, highlighting the premium placed on AI-related skills and the lucrative opportunities within this field. We strongly believe in the potential of AI to enhance human capabilities and this research aims to provide data and insights that help foster a better debate and combat myths about the real impact of AI on the labor market.”\n\nAccording to Aspen Tech Labs’ data, the top 10 markets for AI job vacancies in April were: California, Texas, Washington, New York, Virginia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland and Pennsylvania. The top 50 highest-paying AI job openings were $312,499 to $680,004 annually.\n\nFourlis added, “We look forward to our ongoing partnership with Aspen Tech Labs and introducing a quarterly analysis of U.S. and AI job data, including exploring the ways AI contributes to job creation, job transformation and opportunities for the emerging workforce. We aim to provide data-driven insights and a balanced view of the impact of AI on jobs.”\n\nAbout Veritone\n\nVeritone (NASDAQ: VERI) designs human-centered AI solutions.

      "# [Connected Car News: Wolfspeed, NVIDIA, ABB & Veritone by Lynn Walford on 2024-10-20](https://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2024/10/connected-car-news-wolfspeed-nvidia-abb-veritone/)\nIn connected car News are Wolfspeed, NVIDIA ABB and Veritone.\n\nWofspeed CHIPS & Science Act Funding\n\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce and Wolfspeed (NYSE: WOLF) announced they have signed a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms (PMT) for up to $750 million in proposed direct funding under the CHIPS and Science Act. In addition, a consortium of investment funds led by Apollo, The Baupost Group, Fidelity Management & Research Company and Capital Group have agreed to provide Wolfspeed an additional $750 million of new financing. Together these investments support Wolfspeed’s long-term growth plans and bolster domestic production of silicon carbide to power clean energy systems underpinning electric vehicles (EVs), artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, battery storage and more. In addition, Wolfspeed expects to receive $1 billion of cash tax refunds from the advanced manufacturing tax credit under the CHIPS and Science Act (section 48D), giving the company, in total, access to up to $2.5 billion of expected capital to support the expansion of silicon carbide manufacturing in the United States.\n\nWolfspeed is the world’s largest producer of silicon carbide technology, pioneering the technology more than 35 years ago on the campus of North Carolina State University. Since that time, Wolfspeed has become the global leader in silicon carbide technology, one of the fastest growing components of the broader semiconductor industry.\n\nSilicon carbide is a superior alternative to silicon for high power applications – such as EV powertrains, e-mobility, renewable energy systems, battery energy storage systems, and AI and cryptocurrency data centers – that unlocks improved performance and lower system costs.\n\nNotably, the importance of bolstering the domestic production of silicon carbide has been recognized across multiple federal agencies; the Department of Energy denoted it as one of 17 “critical materials” with a high risk of supply disruption that are integral to clean energy technologies, while the Department of Commerce recognizes silicon carbide semiconductors as important to national security.\n\nAs the U.S. and the world pursue more efficient and environmentally friendly solutions to meet the world’s ever-increasing need for high-voltage energy products, it is crucial that the U.S. continue to make strategic investments to cement its technological leadership position, while continuing to spur American innovation in critical technologies.\n\nWolfspeed CEO, Gregg Lowe, said, “To reach this milestone under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act is an incredible achievement in Wolfspeed’s long-term growth strategy, and we believe today’s announcement is a testament to the market-leading quality of Wolfspeed products and significance of Wolfspeed to broader U.S. economic and national security interests. This support galvanizes our ability to expand domestic manufacturing, accelerate innovation in next-generation semiconductor technology, and meet the increasing global demand for silicon carbide. As a key player in the semiconductor industry, this proposed investment will enable us to solidify our leadership position with a first-of-its-kind 200mm silicon carbide manufacturing footprint in upstate New York and central North Carolina, while contributing to the resilience and competitiveness of the U.S. supply chain. It’s not just about growth for Wolfspeed—it’s about driving technological advancement that powers the future.\n\nThese proposed funds, which are expected to be received upon milestone achievements in the coming years, would enable Wolfspeed to complete its multi-billion-dollar greenfield U.S. capacity expansion plan, which consists of the largest and most advanced 200mm silicon carbide footprint in the world. In addition to the proposed direct funding, Wolfspeed intends to benefit from the U.S. Treasury Department Investment Tax Credit of up to 25% of the qualified capital expenditures primarily related to its construction and installation of equipment at The John Palmour Manufacturing Center for Silicon Carbide in Siler City, NC and completion of the Mohawk Valley Fab M-Line West Expansion in Utica, NY.\n\nThis multi-billion-dollar investment will bolster Wolfspeed’s balance sheet and will help to fuel significant growth through cash generation and accelerate its long-term profitability goals.\n\nSummary of the PMT\n\nThe PMT outlines key terms for a CHIPS incentive award, including the proposed amount and form of the award, and provides that the disbursement of funds will be conditioned upon the achievement of certain operational and construction milestones and other requirements.\n\nThe PMT includes an obligation for Wolfspeed to raise an aggregate of $750 million in debt financing over three tranches through the issuance of senior notes under an amended and restated indenture. Wolfspeed and its lenders, led by Apollo funds, have reached an agreement for this additional financing, including $250 million to be available within 10 business days, and have agreed to certain intercreditor terms with the CHIPS Program Office as described in the PMT.\n\nTogether, the PMT and the agreement with lenders also requires:\n\nWolfspeed to undertake further actions with respect to its capital structure, including (a) restructuring or refinancing its outstanding 2026, 2028 and 2029 convertible notes at specified intervals prior to their respective maturity dates, (b) deferring a total of $120 million in cash interest payments due prior to June 30, 2025 under an unsecured customer refundable deposit agreement, and (c) raising up to $300 million of additional capital from non-debt sources over the next 12 months.\n\nIn addition, Wolfspeed has agreed with its lenders to certain revisions in the terms of the senior notes, including revisions to the interest rate applicable to the senior notes, as described in the Form 8-K filed today with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe PMT provides that the award is subject to due diligence and the negotiation and signing of a definitive direct funding agreement with the Department of Commerce and the negotiation and signing of an intercreditor agreement between the Department of Commerce and the Company’s lenders, which may contain different or additional conditions not contained in the PMT. Additional terms of the PMT were not disclosed.\n\nABB RB 1000iS Paint Atomizer Robot\n\nABB has launched the RB 1000i-S paint atomizer to revolutionize automotive paint shops. The new paint atomizer mounted on top of the ABB robot improves transfer efficiency by upwards of 10%, and can significantly reduce paint waste by a minimum of 30% along with carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared to its predecessor, the RB 1000i. In addition, major efficiency and cost saving benefits have the potential to deliver significant financial savings.\n\n“Major automotive manufacturers have committed to carbon neutral factories by 2035, leaving no stone unturned in their mission to achieve these targets,” said Marc Segura, President – Robotics Division at ABB. “ABB is continuously developing products and services to help companies achieve their sustainability targets. The newly launched RB 1000i-S is just one example of how ABB is expanding its portfolio to help meet the challenges that lie ahead.”\n\nThe RB 1000i-S paint atomizer reduces CO2 and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions in automotive paint shops by reducing paint waste, as well as the overall energy consumption in plants through a more efficient paint process.\n\nCost savings can also be significant. For example, where a manufacturer utilizes a 2.5-liter paint solvent borne per car and produces 200,000 cars per factory annually, the RB 1000i-S paint atomizer through its improved transfer efficiency can help to save 50,000 liters of paint per factory. This equates to USD 500,000 in direct financial savings1.\n\nCustomers can order the new RB 1000i-S atomizer with a new paint robot, or they can purchase a service kit to upgrade their existing RB 1000i by replacing key components, such as the bell cup and shaping air nozzle. The service upgrade kit supports the circular economy and maximizes the lifespan of the existing paint atomizer, increasing product durability and further reducing waste.\n\nThe new paint atomizer along with ABB’s other robotics solutions have been engineered to help customers achieve a more sustainable and resource-efficient future. For example, ABB Robotics new Energy Efficiency Service provides manufacturers with a package of consultation, analysis and tools to increase the energy efficiency of their robots, offering up to 30 percent energy savings (for more details please refer to our previous press release here). In addition, the OmniCoreTM controller consumes up to 20 percent less energy in heavy duty cycles2, thanks to its built-in power back into the grid and re-generation technology. RobotStudo® Automatic Path Planning contributes to improved motion duration, reducing energy consumption by up to 30 percent.\n\nNVIDIA AI Tech Community In Pittsburgh\n\nServing as a bridge for academia, industry and public-sector groups to partner on artificial intelligence innovation, NVIDIA is launching its inaugural AI Tech Community in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nCollaborations with Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, as well as startups, enterprises and organizations based in the “city of bridges,” are part of the new NVIDIA AI Tech Community initiative, announced during the NVIDIA AI Summit in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe initiative aims to supercharge public-private partnerships across communities rich with potential for enabling technological transformation using AI.\n\nTwo NVIDIA joint technology centers will be established in Pittsburgh to tap into expertise in the region.\n\nNVIDIA’s Joint Center with Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) for Robotics, Autonomy and AI will equip higher-education faculty, students and researchers with the latest technologies and boost innovation in the fields of AI and robotics.\n\nNVIDIA’s Joint Center with the University of Pittsburgh for AI and Intelligent Systems will focus on computational opportunities across the health sciences, including applications of AI in clinical medicine and biomanufacturing.\n\nCMU — the nation’s No. 1 AI university according to the U.S. News & World Report — has pioneered work in autonomous vehicles and natural language processing.\n\nCMU’s Robotics Institute, the world’s largest university-affiliated robotics research group, brings a diverse group of more than a thousand faculty, staff, students, post-doctoral fellows and visitors together to solve humanity’s toughest challenges through robotics.\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh — designated as an R1 research university at the forefront of innovation — is ranked No. 6 among U.S. universities in research funding from the National Institutes of Health, topping more than $1 billion in research expenditures in fiscal year 2022 and ranking No. 14 among U.S. universities granted utility patents.\n\nThe university has a long history of learning-technology innovations that are interdisciplinary and conducted within research-practice partnerships.
