  "summary_markdown": "# About TBD\n\nTBD was founded on July 1, 2021 [(Crunchbase, 2025)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tbd-0881). The company was involved in the development of decentralized identity solutions, contributing foundational components under the Web5 umbrella to the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF). This indicates a focus on decentralized technologies and identity solutions. The company has officially wound down its business operations, transitioning several of its primitives and tools to the open-source community. This move suggests that their products were primarily aimed at developers and organizations interested in decentralized identity solutions [(TBD Website)](cache://tbd.website/1).\n\nDue to the transition to open-source, specific customer information is not provided, but the tools and primitives were likely targeted at a B2B audience, particularly developers and organizations in the tech industry.

      "# Post ID 14a01lg: Celebrity Cruise Tbd Guest Two with +2 score by [(yhchiu10, Reddit, 2023-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/celebritycruises/comments/14a01lg/celebrity_cruise_tbd_guest_two/)\nDoes anyone know the process for adding the second guest's name?\n\nMy friend and I just booked a cruise through my friend's account on Celebrity's official website. After that, I created my own account and linked to the reservation successfully by my friend's surname, birthday, and reservation number.\n\nHowever, our iPhone app and website currently both say \" Tbd Guest Two \" instead of my name even if I had already linked to the reservation from my account. When my friend tried to update it online, she found no way to add my name. When we booked, we don't believe we were given the option to add a second guest name at that time. \n\nDoes anyone know the process? Is this something that gets done after the final payment date or the internet check-in date? Do I have to just try and get someone on the phone?\n\n## Comment ID jo7qvji with +3 score by [(gnome1b, Reddit, 2023-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/celebritycruises/comments/14a01lg/celebrity_cruise_tbd_guest_two/jo7qvji/) (in reply to ID 14a01lg):\nJust call the 800 number for celebrity.\n\n## Comment ID jo7r4b5 with +2 score by [(No-Helicopter7299, Reddit, 2023-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/celebritycruises/comments/14a01lg/celebrity_cruise_tbd_guest_two/jo7r4b5/) (in reply to ID 14a01lg):\nCall.\n\n## Comment ID jo7r6wb with +2 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/celebritycruises/comments/14a01lg/celebrity_cruise_tbd_guest_two/jo7r6wb/) (in reply to ID 14a01lg):\nCall Celebrity or text your agent\n\n## Comment ID jo860fm with +2 score by [(therealcatspajamas, Reddit, 2023-06-15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/celebritycruises/comments/14a01lg/celebrity_cruise_tbd_guest_two/jo860fm/) (in reply to ID 14a01lg):\nI did it online somehow.

Some do very well, others not so much. Here is what I have been told by a realtor friend in SoCal - \n\nThe commissions presented on the show are the max. I believe Netflix is just list price * 6%. But half usually goes to the other agent.\n\nThen O group deducts the direct costs for selling the property. All the parties, ads, etc gets recouped.  Sometimes agents will cover expenses that are causing a stalemate. That gets recouped too. \n\nThen you have the brokerage cut. Which is about a third or so - 1% of the original seller side commission (3%). \n\nThen the interesting part - a lot of these listings are Jason or Brett’s clients. They don’t have enough time, and they hand them off. But Jason and Brett still keep a lot of the commission. So yah, the ladies are making .5% -1% commission. So a $10M house is $50k, not the $600K as presented. And the sometimes there are two on the listing with Jason.\n\nMy friend has told me there are agents in the suburbs selling average single family homes doing better financially than those in luxury real estate.\n\n### Comment ID jkxojz0 with +22 score by [(Cartoonexpertornot, Reddit, 2023-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SellingSunset/comments/13m04x9/s06e02_discussion_tbd_on_bre/jkxojz0/) (in reply to ID jku9wsk):\nOne them said in an interview last week that the numbers you see on the show are fake\n\n#### Comment ID jky8nzs with +27 score by [(Jane_Marie_CA, Reddit, 2023-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SellingSunset/comments/13m04x9/s06e02_discussion_tbd_on_bre/jky8nzs/) (in reply to ID jkxojz0):\nYah and not every house we see is for sale at the time of filming. \n\nThere have been a few houses over the years where I have looked it up online only to find the O Group sold it 3 years ago.

It just feels like she can’t direct her anger at the person who truly deserves it because of the power dynamic so she’s taking it out on Chrishelle instead of understanding that they are both pretty much just subject to Jason’s whims.\n\nAlso from Chrishelle’s perspective, like what was she supposed to do? She was a new agent and needed the opportunities to build her portfolio, if she gets a chance, she’s gonna take it, no? How would it look for her as a new employee to reject opportunities given to her by her boss so she doesn’t offend Nicole? If anything, having been at O Group for so long and doing so well, Nicole should be a bit more understanding, like sharing the credit for one listing should have such an impact on the “real Queen of the Valley”.

I mean I guess each season has always dug for drama, but the Christine drama made sense, because Christine is mean. \n\nThe drama this season is just plain stupid. \"Chelsea said this about Bre's baby dady...\", \"Chrishell put herself as a co-agent for my listing ...\" , \"Emma tried to steal my client even though I didn't sign an exclusivity contract with my agent...\", \"Mary spent more time with Jason than me after our break up...\"\n\nIt's just annoying. They are always trying to make nothing into something. With friends and coworkers like the women in the O Group, who needs enemies? Also, maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but the queen of making nothing into something is Heather. I still remember when she beefed over Amanza, because Amanza said that Heather meeting Tarek's children after two weeks was a little soon.  I remember how Heather was furious at Christine because Christine said \"something\" to TMZ about Tarek.

She is finally doing adult stuff vs Christine and the ridiculous grade 4 catfights. She had her moments and it was sooooo forced during the last 2 seasons. Happy to see someone that feels more adult and is actually a top earner at the O group. Also, to be fair, if you have ever been working with women being so high in the food chain, they tend to be like this.

But I said the same about Christine in season 1, so I really hope these words won’t come back to bite me.\n\nNicole — um so why is she on the show again? She is not even a fun villain to watch. The energy is too intensely bitter. I hope she gets some therapy because she needs letting go.\n\nAlso, what’s going on with Mary? I don’t quite get it. She seems off. \n\nLoving Emma this season so far. She has let loose a bit and has been kind.\n\nChelsea gets me scratching my head. Why you gotta antagonize Bre like that?

Once all the defects started getting revealed and the recalls and delays were announced, I got an email, maybe about a week and a half ago, saying my pick up date was moved to August 23. I just got an email today saying that it's been delayed AGAIN, but now with a TBD placeholder. Anyone else get an email like that? And does anyone have any idea when we'll be getting the earphones now? \n\nUPDATE: Samsung sent me an email asking me to review my new Buds3 Pros.

They could also just straight up say they don't know how long it'll take, just longer than initially expected, instead of no reason at all. Besides, they still have a set date for August 28th if you order it to be delivered directly to you from the Samsung store, so why is there no new set date for people picking up their orders from Best Buy?

I’ve been a Samsung user since the first Galaxy Note (I miss the Note 4 with the universal remote IR blaster), and I have preordered every single item I’ve ever had from the Note 8 to the S24U. (Trade-ins and the incentives mean I rarely pay even *half* the cost of anything, so I just keep that ball rolling.) That’s several phones, tablets, watches, and buds. I’ve never had a single issue aside from a shipper goofing my N20U delivery, and Samsung gave me a $100 credit to spend on any accessories, chargers, etc., for a mobile device. It wasn’t even their fault. Now I can’t even get a straightforward answer on anything for these. I understand that things can go wrong, sometimes catastrophically, but just give me some details, and I’m fine. I hate being in the dark like this.

In contrast, the variant I advocate for utilizes short-lived feature branches for pull requests before merging them frequently back into the trunk. This variant is sometimes, confusingly, equated with GitHub Flow.\n\nIf you are using branches at all, you're not using TBD, from what I've heard from advocates. They don't push every commit to trunk, but they also aren't working on a branch either, and they are supposed to be integrating multiple times per day with other code changes on trunk, not merely pulling trunk changes into their branch.\n\nSounds like the author is using GitHub Flow with a particular emphasis on very short-lived branches, but wants to call that TBD.\n\nIf that's wrong, I'd like to know the difference between the two. Surely it can't just be \"lifetime of branches\", to be called a different strategy.\n\n### Comment ID k9qdz4f with +9 score by [(BandicootGood5246, Reddit, 2023-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9qdz4f/) (in reply to ID k9p6udy):\nI think it's a purist argument to say you have to use no branches. From what I've seen short lived branches works pretty similar. \n\nMy main problem with gitflow is you're not always aiming for your code to be production ready at all times because Dev can be in weird intermediate state, and can lead to a bunch of things like gold-plating or \"it doesn't matter this isn't ready for prod it's only Dev\"\n\n#### Comment ID k9sdeeg with +2 score by [(lIIllIIlllIIllIIl, Reddit, 2023-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9sdeeg/) (in reply to ID k9qdz4f):\nAt my job, we say we do trunk-based development because all our branches are only 1-degree of separation from the main branch.

I've just talked with a bunch of TBD purists who care very much. They are kind of annoying about it, especially when they insist that TBD is required for CI as well. No TBD, no CI, because it's not \"continuous\".\n\nI'm mainly asking because the author themselves made the point that what they are doing is definitely not GitHub Flow, but it actually sounds liked it is. I was hoping someone could actually point to a meaningful distinction.\n\nI also disagree with TBD advocates and their over-reliance on feature flags.

If a person has the rigor to commit to trunk, their changes are already isolated until they push a set of commits. What does a branch give them? And why wouldn't this scale?\n\nIf anything, scaled TBD seems like a weird thing, because it stresses that branches are for a single developer only. Why the heck would a team want to limit itself from collaboration like that? I think it's better when multiple devs are working on a feature (or at least have the opportunity to do this), because then they are designing and testing it together live, rather than waiting for a review on the PR. The way I see it, the only benefit of creating a branch is to have a named HEAD to share.\n\n### Comment ID k9qlzdw with +3 score by [(goranlepuz, Reddit, 2023-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9qlzdw/) (in reply to ID k9p6udy):\n>However, I don't get why the author said their approach is different from GitHub Flow\n\nhttps://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/ clearly says \"branches and trunk\", so indeed.\n\nI think the author is mixing up GitHub flow and ye olde git flow, which are compared e.g. here https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git-flow-vs-github-flow/\n\n### Comment ID k9ry3z2 with +2 score by [(repeating_bears, Reddit, 2023-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9ry3z2/) (in reply to ID k9p6udy):\n>If you are using branches at all, you're not using TBD\n\nI agree, but [trunkbaseddevelopment.com](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com) (which is by no means an authority, just some random fuck who bothered to register the domain) defines two strategies:\n\n\"Trunk-Based Development For Smaller Teams\" and \"Scaled Trunk-Based Development\"\n\nAnd they're about as different as branching strategies can get.

The hard part is training the team on small, consistent, commits. It’s very easy to get heads down and forget to commit. \n\nThat said, I wouldn’t say we NEVER use branches, but it is very rare. If I get pulled off to another card after partially completing work, I’ll move it onto a branch so the changes don’t get lost. The key at that point is to make sure you that when you do start work on the branch that you merge it into into trunk as soon as it’s buildable again.  Or do it immediately and keep the changes local, but if you’re sharing a machine with other devs this can get confusing. \n\nSuffice to say, I think there is a place for branches in TBD, and in some sense what OP is doing us TBD but with additional steps that I personally don’t really see the benefit of? Seems incredibly confusing to make so many tiny branches like that but 🤷‍♂️\n\n#### Comment ID k9q5m6e with +7 score by [(Mattsvaliant, Reddit, 2023-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9q5m6e/) (in reply to ID k9pqf22):\nSo how do you do PRs and code review?\n\n#### Comment ID k9qh12q with +4 score by [(goranlepuz, Reddit, 2023-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9qh12q/) (in reply to ID k9pqf22):\n(At my work, we regularly use branches).\n\n>so long as people are consistently pushing to the main trunk branch it immensely cuts back on merge conflicts!\n\nWhat also cuts it back is occasionally merging from trunk to my branch.\n\nI think this phrase is indicative of people not being sufficiently comfortable with source control. Maybe it's the fault of git having a somewhat shit user experience, dunno.\n\n#### Comment ID k9q6hg9 with +3 score by [(fishling, Reddit, 2023-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9q6hg9/) (in reply to ID k9pqf22):\nI did what was pretty much TBD in the past, for a client/server product. All mainline development was on trunk. (We had customer support fixes for released products on their own branches, one per supported release, but almost all development was on trunk).\n\nIt was okay, but not amazing. I can't say I've had much issues with merge conflicts in the past, no matter what approach we were using. Developers with poor habits are going to be a problem no matter what approach is being used. A dev messing up feature flags and failing to guard their code correctly is going to be a problem as well.\n\nAlso, I think strict TBD doesn't work very well for non-cloud programs and non-web apps.\n\n#### Comment ID k9qrsms with +1 score by [(ErGo404, Reddit, 2023-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9qrsms/) (in reply to ID k9pqf22):\nIs your main branch always in a \"releasable\" state with TBD ?\n\nIf not, how do you handle releases ?\n\nHow do you handle the development of large features ?

It can be a local branch and a corresponding remote branch (on a fork) if you're doing PRs. It can be a local branch if you submit patches to a mailing list like Linux kernel people do. Some notion of branching may remain even if you pushed straight to master with no review.\n\nP.S.

Trunk is stable because the devs can be trusted to only merge tested code they're not just chucking any old shite in untested.

      "# [Sutter Health Park Effects...TBD by Nico on 2024-10-12](https://www.athleticsnation.com/2024/10/12/24268323/sutter-health-park-effects-tbd-j-p-sears-joey-estes-sacramento-river-cats-meow)\nThe presumption seems to be that the A’s are moving to a launching pad in 2025, and so long as 40% of the rotation includes JP Sears and Joey Estes I suppose HRs will not be in short supply.\n\nBut some of the notion of Sacramento as a hitter’s paradise comes from perception that does not necessarily mirror reality. Sutter is being contrasted with the pitcher friendly Oakland Coliseum, with its vast foul territory and evening marine layer. Certainly, a park with normal amounts of foul ground and no heavy fog will play more fairly for the hitters.\n\nThe other perception altering factor is the temperature. It is presumed that any climate that reaches 100 degrees will be conducive to the long ball, but Sacramento is not the Las Vegas desert nor does it feature the Denver altitude. And HRs are only one measure of offense — hot days don’t help a ball scoot through the infield or find acreage in right-center field.\n\nSome truths about Sutter Health Park: the dimensions are comparable to the Coliseum. In fact it is an identical 330 feet to straightaway LF and a few feet deeper to CF at 403 feet. RF is 5 feet shorter at 325 feet. So it is not a “band box” by any means.\n\nAlso, while summers do get over 100 degrees in Sacramento the vast majority of the games are going to be scheduled at night to offset the heat, and so game time temperatures will generally be in the 80s and falling throughout the evening.\n\nOn the flip side, if they do in fact make the horrible and irresponsible decision to install turf that will likely create more offense by way of balls scooting faster through the infield and in the outfield.\n\nPut it all together and certainly you won’t have a pitcher’s park like the A’s have played in for decades. But it’s unclear how much of a hitter’s park it will be or how much it might play “fair” or “neutral”.\n\nI guess it’s looking like the field will play “a bit the hitter-y side of neutral,” which is certainly a significant shift from what A’s fans are accustomed to. But depending on how the turf (if it’s turf) is actually designed and installed, you could conceivably have a surface that slowed down balls a touch more than natural grass, which could in turn shift the metrics radically.\n\nI guess what I’m pointing out is that in a scenario where the grass/turf surface actually favors the defense over the batter, in the 4th inning where the temperature is in the mid-70s and it’s still 325-330 to the corners and 403 to CF...we probably shouldn’t jump to assume games are going to be 9-7.\n\nI do know this: if you’re an A’s hitter who has called the Coliseum home and who has seen his batting average take the usual .010-.020 point dip from foul balls that never made it into the seats and the relentless marine layer, you might be looking forward to at least the level playing field Sacramento will offer.\n\nBut this isn’t Fenway Park with it’s “310 feet” to LF (cough under 300 cough) or Wrigley Field with the wind blowing fiercely out. If you’re a hitter, you will still have to hit the ball well and if you’re a pitcher you should have a fighting chance.\n\nOne question the A’s front office has to consider is: do they want to factor in their new home park in how they build their roster, and if so how should they tilt? This becomes a more difficult strategy when you don’t know, exactly, what to expect. And we won’t really know until the A’s play some games there — yes, the River Cats have previewed life on the field but AAA baseball just isn’t the same game as the MLB version.\n\nWe will find out in 5.5 months just how the field plays, by which time it will even have a playing surface ready to play on. Until then all we can do is conjecture, so: conjecture away. What do you expect? And how should the A’s plan for life at Sutter Health Park in order to gain a home field advantage?",

      "# [Transportation Benefit Districts (TBDs)](https://mrsc.org/explore-topics/finance/revenues/transportation-benefit-districts)\nOverview\n\nChapter 36.73 RCW authorizes cities (see also RCW 35.21.225) and counties to form transportation benefit districts (TBDs), quasi-municipal corporations and independent taxing districts that can raise revenue for specific transportation projects, usually through vehicle license fees or sales taxes.\n\nTransportation benefit district revenue may be used for transportation improvements included in a local, regional, or state transportation plan (RCW 36.73.015(6)). Improvements can range from roads and transit service to sidewalks and transportation demand management. Construction, maintenance, and operation costs are eligible.\n\nList of TBDs\n\nAs of December 2024, MRSC is aware of more than 120 cities and towns in Washington that have established TBDs, many of which are funded by sales taxes or vehicle license fees as described below.\n\nMRSC is only aware of six counties that have established a TBD. One of those (a partial-county TBD serving the Point Roberts peninsula) relies on the border area fuel tax, while the rest are unfunded.\n\nFor the complete list of TBDs that MRSC is aware of, download the following file:\n\nList of transportation benefit districts (Excel) – Includes funding information for each TBD, as well as when it was formed and whether its powers have been assumed. Information can be sorted and filtered.\n\nFormation\n\nAny city or county may form a TBD by ordinance, following a public hearing, if it finds that the action is in the public interest (RCW 36.73.050). The establishing ordinance must specify the boundaries of the district - which may include all or part of the city or county establishing the TBD - and the transportation improvements that will be funded. The boundaries and functions of the TBD may not be changed without further public hearings.\n\nA transportation benefit district may include all or part of the territory in another jurisdiction (city, county, port district, county transportation authority, or public transportation benefit area) through interlocal agreement (RCW 36.73.020(2)).\n\nGovernance\n\nAlmost all TBDs share the same boundaries as their establishing jurisdiction, in which case they must be governed by the members of that jurisdiction's legislative body, acting as a separate legal entity. Even though they comprise the same members, the legislative body and the governing board are separate and distinct bodies and must hold separate and distinct meetings.\n\nHowever, if the jurisdiction that established the TBD votes to \"assume\" its powers as described below – which most jurisdictions have – the TBD ceases to be a separate legal entity and no longer requires separate meetings.\n\nIf a TBD includes territory in multiple jurisdictions, it must be governed under an interlocal agreement pursuant to chapter 39.34 RCW, with the governing board conforming to the requirements of RCW 36.73.020(3).\n\nAssumption of Powers\n\nAny city or county that forms a TBD with the same boundaries as the city or county may absorb the TBD and assume all of its \"rights, powers, functions, and obligations,\" with the result that the TBD ceases to exist as a separate legal entity (chapter 36.74 RCW).\n\nThe city or county legislative authority must first hold a public hearing according to the requirements of RCW 36.74.020-.030. If, after the hearing, the legislative authority determines that “public interest or welfare would be satisfied” by the assumption of the TBD, it passes an ordinance or resolution that abolishes the TBD governing body and vests the city or county legislative authority with all the rights, powers, functions, and obligations that the TBD governing body possessed.\n\nAs of July 2022, about 85% of the cities and towns that have established TBDs have also assumed their powers. (See the \"List of TBDs\" section above for details.)\n\nFunding Sources\n\nTransportation benefit districts are primarily funded through sales taxes and/or vehicle license fees. There are several other funding options available such as border area fuel taxes, bonds, and impact fees, but these are seldom or never used.\n\nSales and Use Taxes\n\nThe most common TBD funding source is a sales and use tax of up to 0.3% (RCW 82.14.0455 and RCW 36.73.040(3)(a)).\n\nEffective July 1, 2022, 0.1% of this sales tax may (optionally) be imposed by a majority vote of the governing board as long as the TBD includes all of the territory within the jurisdiction(s) forming the TBD. Otherwise, the sales tax must be approved by a simple majority of voters.\n\nThese sales tax may generally not exceed 10 years, but they may be renewed for additional 10-year periods with voter approval or a vote of the governing board, as appropriate. The TBD sales tax may only exceed 10 years for the repayment of debt, in which case the ballot measure should state the intended use and duration of the debt service.\n\nIn recent years, voters have approved the vast majority of all proposed TBD sales and use taxes. For individual results, see MRSC’s Local Ballot Measure Database (select \"Filter by Ballot Categories,\" select the \"Funding Type/Statutory Authority\" drop-down menu, and look for the TBD sales tax and TBD vehicle license fee options).\n\nVehicle License Fees\n\nAnother common TBD funding source is a vehicle license fee (RCW 82.80.140, RCW 36.73.040(3)(b)). Initiative 976, approved by voters in 2019, would have eliminated the ability to impose any TBD vehicle license fees. However, this initiative was ruled unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court in 2020 (Garfield County Transp. Auth. et al. v. State et al.).\n\nTBDs may impose councilmanic vehicle license fees up to $50 without voter approval, subject to the following conditions, or may impose fees up to $100 with voter approval.\n\nA TBD may impose a nonvoted vehicle license fee up to $20 at any time, but a TBD may only impose a nonvoted vehicle license fee above $20 as follows:\n\nUp to $40, but only if a $20 fee has been in effect for at least 24 months.\n\nUp to $50, but only if a $40 fee has been in effect for at least 24 months. Any nonvoted fee higher than $40 is subject to potential referendum, as provided in RCW 36.73.065(6).\n\nAny license fees over these amounts, up to a maximum of $100, must be approved by a simple majority of voters. However, most jurisdictions have opted for the councilmanic (nonvoted) fees. The only TBD to successfully pass a voted vehicle license fee is the Seattle TBD, where voters approved a $60 fee increase in 2014 after rejecting a similar increase in 2011. A handful of other jurisdictions have attempted voted TBD license fees without success, including Bremerton, Burien, and Edmonds (all in 2009) and King County (in 2014).\n\nIf two or more TBDs with the authority to impose a nonvoted fee overlap, credits must be issued so that the combined nonvoted fees do not exceed $50 total.\n\nIf a countywide TBD wishes to impose a vehicle license fee, it must distribute the revenues to each city in the county by interlocal agreement, which must be approved by 60% of the cities representing 75% of the city population (RCW 82.80.140(2)(a)). If this threshold cannot be met, a district that includes the unincorporated areas only may impose the nonvoted license fees discussed above (RCW 36.73.065(5)).\n\nFor a list of current TBD vehicle license fees, see the Department of Licensing’s page on local transportation benefit district fees.\n\nOther Funding Sources\n\nOther potential funding sources include:\n\nGeneral obligation bonds (RCW 36.73.070). MRSC is only aware of one TBD that has attempted to pass a bond measure, and it failed with 50% of the vote (Auburn TBD, 2012).\n\nBorder area fuel tax, only available to TBDs that include a Canadian border crossing (RCW 82.47.020). MRSC is aware of one TBD – Point Roberts – that uses this funding mechanism.\n\nImpact fees on commercial and industrial development in accordance with the Local Transportation Act, chapter 39.92 RCW. See RCW 36.73.040(3)(c) and RCW 36.73.120. (Note that this authority is different than the impact fees authorized more broadly for jurisdictions fully planning under the Growth Management Act.)\n\nVehicle tolls (RCW 36.73.040(3)(d)).\n\nExcess property taxes (RCW 36.73.060), which may only be imposed one year at a time and require supermajority voter approval each time.\n\nLocal improvement districts (LIDs) (RCW 36.73.080). However, note that a TBD may only form an LID under the petition method, which means the request to form an LID must originate from local property owners rather than the TBD's governing body.\n\nMaterial Change Policies\n\nTBDs must adopt a material change policy that addresses significant changes to the transportation improvement finance plan that affect project delivery or the ability to finance the plan (RCW 36.73.160(1)). The policy must at least address material changes to cost, scope, and schedule, the level of change that will require governing body involvement, and how the governing body will address those changes. At a minimum, the policy must require the governing body to hold a public hearing if the revised cost exceeds the original estimate by more than 20%.\n\nBudgeting\n\nState law does not clearly require TBDs to adopt an appropriations budget. However, adopting a budget would be considered a best practice, and a number of TBDs have done so, setting up the budget process to coincide with the annual/biennial process used by the establishing jurisdiction. It is up to the TBD governing board to develop and adopt a budget policy.\n\nUnder RCW 36.73.020(4), the treasurer of the establishing city or county must serve, in an independent and ex officio capacity, as the TBD treasurer.\n\nAnnual Reporting\n\nTransportation benefit districts must submit annual financial reports to the State Auditor’s Office (SAO) using the BARS reporting templates (RCW 43.09.230). For information on the specific TBD accounting requirements, see the BARS Manual, Section 3.11.1. For assistance developing financial reports, see MRSC’s page on Annual Financial Reporting.\n\nIf the city has assumed its TBD, it must still prepare a separate annual financial report for the final (full or partial) year of the TBD's existence, and the city must submit a New Entity Creation or Dissolution Notification form as noted earlier. For all future years after this final report is completed, the TBD's activities will be incorporated into the city's regular annual financial report.\n\nIn addition to the SAO annual financial report, RCW 36.73.160(2) requires TBDs to issue a separate annual transportation improvement report detailing the district revenues, expenditures and the status of all projects, including cost and construction schedules. The report must be distributed to the public and newspapers of record in the district.

You get more talks than just on the day too…\n\nThere’s no half-stepping at TBD…you don’t come for half a day.\n\n20+\n\nTOPICS\n\nFocused on what matters to new materials, TBD ‘Eigengrau’ features an expansive collection of intertwined topics. We’ll cover Agentic AI to Generation Beta. Strap in to explore your future opportunities and how to make the most of them. TBD isn’t just a one-day event. TBD’s editorial calendar spans the next 12-24 months and every ticket offers value beyond the day.\n\n1\n\nMEMORABLE DAY\n\nThe world-class Groovy Gecko will handle Live-streaming, and there will be on-demand elements after the conference. We work with multiple psychologists and cognitive scientists every year to maximise attendee’s information retention and enjoyment. From state-dependent learning to a unique virtual environment, we focus on remembering speakers' information so you can apply it later. Expect surprises.\n\nAttendees at TBD range from global C-suite execs to brand managers, startup founders to agency leaders, politicians to startups. You’ll meet senior execs and leaders from Moét to McDonald’s, Nike to NATO, Disney to Duracell and more than 400 others. 2024 sees us live and on-demand, expect to be connected to even more interesting people from every continent before, during and after the conference.\n\nNeed another reason? TBD counts towards your CPD (up to six credits). Plus, we’re 100% recommended by D.I.C.E., the people who provide certification and guidance to help conferences and events deliver a representative and diverse set of speakers, perspectives, and attendees.\n\nThe final program for TBD is never revealed until the day of the conference in order to make it the most relevant and useful for attendees. Speakers and themes, however, are disclosed. We demand big ideas and thought-provoking talks at ‘Eigengrau’ that will push you, your business and your thinking forward.\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nThe rise of AI search, robotaxis, small language models, and nanorobotic healthcare signals the next phase of disruption. TBD reveals how these breakthroughs are reshaping industries and what your organisation must do to keep pace.\n\nBEHAVIOUR\n\nLeadership in the grey demands more than strategy. Hybrid work, trust deficits, and (un)conscious algorithmic bias are forcing a rethink of how we lead and connect. ‘Eigengrau’ is going to equip you with the tools to navigate ambiguity and reshape the way people work and thrive.\n\nDATA\n\nData is chaos disguised as power. Weaponised misinformation, geopolitical interference, and shifting consumer behaviour create instability. How do you find clarity in this noise? Who is shaping the future—and are you ready to compete? Get ready for signal in the noise.\n\nAND MORE...\n\nAI lawyers, the quantum internet, and CRISPR breakthroughs are here.
