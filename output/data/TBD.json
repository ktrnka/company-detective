      "# [Home](https://tbd.website/)\nGlobally, 1.7 billion adults lack access to the banking system, yet two-thirds of them own a mobile phone that could help them access financial services. The internet and wireless technology has given us the information infrastructure we need to serve everybody, but money and payments have not kept pace.\n\nOur mission is to catalyze a community of developers, enterprises and entrepreneurs to build an open financial system, based on open source protocols and common standards, that can facilitate the movement of value anywhere around the world in an efficient, inclusive and trusted way.\n\nTBD is focused on building open protocols, open standards and open development communities to create an ecosystem of tools that all participants in the economy can benefit from: individuals, businesses, institutions and yes, even governments.\n\nThe power of open source is that TBD collaborates with developers from all over the world, and with other businesses and institutions who share our vision for a more open financial system.\n\nThe most important information we need to own is information about ourselves. Today, our identities and log-ins are controlled by increasingly centralized entities.\n\nBefore we can build a new system in which people are in control of their digital and financial lives, we need to start with fixing identity.\n\nThe great power of the internet has been the democratization of information. With decentralized identity, TBD is reinventing the account model of the internet â to empower people to own their identities, unlock access to financial services, and regain privacy and control over how their personal data is used.\n\ntbDEX is an open protocol that can facilitate the transfer of value anywhere around the world â whether to relatives in other countries, employees in other jurisdictions, or suppliers around the world.\n\ntbDEX creates a bridge, based on open standards, that connects the world of legacy currencies to digital currencies, without the need for centralized intermediaries or governance tokens. True to open source practices, tbDEX is a protocol that is available to everyone, but owned by no one.",

You retain all rights in your Content, subject to the rights you granted to us in these TBD Terms.\n\nYou will not upload or provide Content or otherwise post, transmit, distribute, or disseminate through the Services any material that: (a) is false, misleading, unlawful, obscene, indecent, lewd, pornographic, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, hateful, abusive, or inflammatory; (b) encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense or gives rise to civil liability; (c) breaches or infringes any duty toward or rights of any person or entity, including rights of publicity, privacy or Intellectual Property Rights; (d) contains corrupted data or any other harmful, disruptive, or destructive files; (e) advertises products or services competitive with TBDâs or its partnersâ products and services, as determined by us in our sole discretion; or (f) in our sole judgment, is objectionable, restricts or inhibits any person or entity from using or enjoying any portion of the Services, or which may expose TBD, its affiliates or its customers or other persons to harm or liability of any nature.\n\nAlthough we have no obligation to monitor any Content, we have absolute discretion to remove Content at any time and for any reason without notice. TBD may also monitor such Content to detect and prevent fraudulent activity or violations of TBD Terms. You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, or objectionable. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any Content, including any loss or damage to any of your Content.\n\nGeneral. You and TBD agree that any and all Disputes, except those that are resolved informally or brought in a small claims court, will be arbitrated by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same individual damages and individual relief that a court can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TBD TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST TBD. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration).\n\nPre-Filing Requirement to Attempt to Resolve Disputes. Before an arbitration is commenced, you or TBD agree to attempt to avoid the costs of formal dispute resolution by giving each other a full and fair opportunity to address and resolve a Dispute informally. Both parties recognize that this is an important requirement, and that breach of this requirement would be a material breach of the Terms. To provide this opportunity, before commencing any arbitration or suit, each party agrees to send to the other party a written Notice (âNoticeâ). Any Notice to TBD should be sent by mail to Block, Inc., Attn: TBD Arbitration Provision, PO Box 427069, San Francisco, CA 94142. Any Notice sent to you will be sent to the address on file for your account. The Notice must: (i) include your name and account number; (ii) provide detailed information sufficient to evaluate the merits of the claiming partyâs individualized claim and for the other party to determine if an amicable resolution is possible; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought, including whatever amount of money is demanded and the means by which the demanding party calculated the claimed damages. Both parties agree that they will attempt to resolve a dispute through an informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice is sent. After that sixty (60) day period and not before, either party may commence arbitration. Each party agrees that state courts in the City and County of San Francisco, California, or federal court for the Northern District of California, referenced below, may enter injunctive relief to enforce the pre-filing requirements of this paragraph, including an injunction to stay an arbitration that has been commenced in violation of this paragraph.\n\nScope of Arbitration. If we are not able to resolve the Dispute by informal negotiation or, as provided below, in a small claims court, all Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator (the âArbitratorâ) administered by the American Arbitration Association (https://www.adr.org ) according to this Section and theÂ Commercial Arbitration Rules Â for that forum, except you and TBD will have the right to file early or summary dispositive motions and to request that the AAAâs Expedited Procedures apply regardless of the claim amount. Except as set forth above, the Arbitrator shall be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the TBD Terms and/or Additional Terms (or any aspect thereof) are enforceable, unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.\n\nSmall Claims Court. Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, either party may elect to pursue a Dispute in a local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as the matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual basis. If a party has already submitted an arbitration demand to the AAA, the other party may, in its sole discretion, inform the AAA that it chooses to have the Dispute heard in small claims court. At that time, the AAA will close the arbitration and the Dispute will be heard in the appropriate small claims court, with no fees due from the arbitration respondent.\n\nArbitration Procedures. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1-16, including its procedural provisions, fully applies. Any arbitration hearing will occur in San Francisco, California, at another mutually agreeable location or, if both parties agree, by telephone or videoconference. The Arbitratorâs award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. TBD values your privacy, particularly with respect to your financial transactions and data. Each of the parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration and shall not (without the prior written consent of the other party) disclose to any third party the fact, existence, content, award, or other result of the arbitration, except as may be necessary to enforce, enter, or challenge such award in a court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise required by applicable law. While an arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief, the Arbitrator may do so only with respect to the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual partyâs claim. The Arbitratorâs decision and judgment thereon will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect.\n\nArbitration Fees. In accordance with the AAA Rules, the party initiating the arbitration (either you or us) is responsible for paying the applicable filing fee. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and TBD also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the Services.\n\nOpt Out. You may reject this provision, in which case only a court may be used to resolve any Dispute. To reject this provision, you must send us an opt-out notice (the âOpt Outâ) within thirty (30) days after you create a TBD account or we first provide you with the right to reject this provision.\n\nThe Opt Out must be mailed to Block, Inc., Attn: TBD Arbitration Provision, PO Box 427069, San Francisco, CA 94142. For your convenience, we are providing an opt outÂ notice form Â you must fill in to Opt Out. You must complete this form by providing your name, address, phone number and the email address(es) you used to sign up and use the Services. This is the only way of opting out of this provision. Opting out will not affect any other aspect of the TBD Terms, Additional Terms, or the Services, and will have no effect on any other or future agreements you may reach to arbitrate with us.\n\nCourt Proceedings. Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions as discussed above) will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts in the City and County of San Francisco, California, or federal court for the Northern District of California.",

      "# [Quickstart](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/quickstart/)\nWeb5 in 5️⃣ minutes\n\nLet's build a decentralized application on the Web5 platform - in under 5 minutes. You will learn how to:\n\n✅ Create unique digital IDs for users known as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)\n\n✅ Issue and manage digital proofs using Verifiable Credentials(VCs)\n\n✅ Store and read data from your users' personal data store called a Decentralized Web Node (DWN)\n\nLet’s go! 🚀\n\nThis will be the home of your new Web5 app. Run the following commands in your CLI:\n\nUse NPM to initialize a package.json file:\n\nUse NPM to install Web5:\n\nThese steps will create a package.json in the root of your project. Open the newly created package.json and add module as a type:\n\nCreate an index.js file where you will write all of your application logic:\n\nFor Windows using PowerShell:\n\nAt the top of your index.js file, add these lines to import the Web5 package dependencies that you will use to build your application::\n\nAdditional import for Node 18\n\nimport{ webcrypto }from'node:crypto';\n\nif(!globalThis.crypto) globalThis.crypto= webcrypto;\n\nNow that you've installed the Web5 SDKs, you are ready to start building!\n\nIn Web5 apps, a user’s unique identifier - like an email address - is called a Decentralized Identifier (DID). We are building a decentralized app, so your users are using identifiers that aren't tied to a centralized authority.\n\nThe Web5 class is an isolated API object for doing all things Web5. The connect() function creates an instance of Web5 and also creates a decentralized identifier or obtains connection to an existing one.\n\nIn index.js below the import statement, create a new instance of Web5:\n\nThis Web5 instance is what you'll use to access the other objects of Web5 such as dwn. Within the connect function we’re using dht as the DID method. Learn more DID methods.\n\nTest your code\n\nWanna see the DID you just created?\n\nIn index.js, add the following line and save your file:\n\nconsole.log(aliceDid);\n\nThen from the terminal, run:\n\nnode index.js\n\nYou'll see the newly created DID.\n\nYour DID will appear here\n\nIn the previous step, you generated what is known as a (DID), which appears as an alphanumeric string. It's more specifically referred to as a DID URI.\n\nThis DID URI is part of a broader JSON object, known as a Bearer DID, which contains metadata such as cryptographic keys that prove ownership of the DID and rules governing its usage, management, or modification. With a Bearer DID, the owner can securely sign and verify data, ensuring authenticity and integrity.\n\nTo access your Bearer DID, add the following lines of code to your index.js:\n\nJavaScript\n\nKotlin\n\nSwift\n\nTest your code\n\nWanna see the Bearer DID?\n\nIn index.js, add the following line and save your file:\n\nconsole.log(aliceBearerDid);\n\nThen from the terminal, run:\n\nnode index.js\n\nYou'll see the Bearer DID.\n\nYour Bearer DID will appear here\n\nVerifiable Credentials (VCs) are digital proofs used to confirm specific facts about individuals, organizations, or entities. In this step, you'll enable your users to create a self-signed VC -- allowing them to issue a Verifiable Credential that makes claims about themselves. For this example, the credential will state that the user has completed the Web5 Quickstart Guide.\n\nIn your index.js, create your Verifiable Credential:\n\nJavaScript\n\nKotlin\n\nSwift\n\nTest your code\n\nWanna see the VC you just created?\n\nIn index.js, add the following line and save your file:\n\nconsole.log(vc);\n\nThen from the terminal, run:\n\nnode index.js\n\nYou'll see the newly created Verifiable Credential.\n\nEnter a name in the input field and click \"Run\" to create a Verifiable Credential.\n\nYour VC will appear here\n\nNow, your users can sign the VC with their Bearer DID to ensure its authenticity and integrity.\n\nTo allow users to sign a VC, add this line to your index.js:\n\nJavaScript\n\nKotlin\n\nSwift\n\nWhen an issuer signs a VC, it attests that they are truly the one who issued it.

Instead, their data should be stored in their DWN. This is how the user retains ownership over their content. Through permissions, users can decide which apps can read, write, and delete content from their DWN.\n\nThe DWN exists in local storage. The DWN persists across browser sessions and can be synched across a user's devices.\n\nA user can host their DWN in multiple locations. The Web5 SDK is both browser and Node.js compliant, meaning you can use the same APIs on both client side and serverside.\n\nTo store a VC in a DWN, add the following lines of code to your index.js:\n\nJavaScript\n\nKotlin\n\nSwift\n\nTest your code\n\nLet's see what was just written to the DWN.\n\nIn index.js, add the following line and save your file:\n\nconsole.log('writeResult', record);\n\nThen from the terminal, run:\n\nnode index.js\n\nYou'll see the record that was written to the user's DWN.

      "# [Web Assembly with ChatGPT by Mic Neale on 2023-01-10](https://developer.tbd.website/blog/chatgpt-writingcode/)\nWeb Assembly is a popular format for running binary applications in web browsers (with wide support).\n\nThis can have a few advantages but the interesting thing for us is that this can allow sharing of implementations of functionality: credential issuance, DID resolving, cryptographic functions, etc which you may not want to necessarily re-implement in JavaScript or TypeScript.\n\nThe SSI-SDK is an implementation of a lot of standards for self-sovereign identity, so it is a great candidate to expose via WASM to web apps.\n\nNow there is a whole lot of (let's face it: tedious) machinery to get WASM to be compiled from Go (ok if you are really curious you can read the code), but the upshot of it is that there is a .wasm file produced which when consumed in just the right way in a web page, allows you to call functions from JavaScript, that look and feel like JavaScript, but are actually running in the web-assembly machiner (and compiled down from Golang).\n\nSay you had a function in Golang land which looked like this:\n\nYou could call it from the web via:\n\nand it would Just Work thanks to WASM! Well, thanks to WASM and a lot of boring glue.\n\nBut the boring glue is what I am here to talk about it, as it turns out ChatGPT can be quite helpful for the boring (but important) glue.\n\nSo firstly, there is some work to be done to build a shim between the JavaScript type world and the Golang type world:\n\nThis gets more complicated when you have more complicated types, but essentially this is the pattern you follow to expose functionality. Now I am a pretty ordinary Golang developer, so being lazy I thought I would see if I could teach ChatGPT about WASM and if it could write this glue code for me.\n\nHelpfully the SSI-SDK has a good amount of test coverage, so to teach ChatCPT about the API I was trying to expose, I pasted in a test case which exercised the API. The functionality was the \"Resolve\" function above, and the test code showed how to use it.\n\nI then asked ChatGPT to provide a WASM friendly wrapper for that functionality:\n\nTo do this, I gave it an example of some previously written code that uses some (unrelated) functionality and also exposes it to WASM. As you can see it was happy to provide an implementation which whilst close, with some minor tweaking.\n\nI was able to tidy it up and include it in the pull request. Handy - thanks ChatGPT! Moreover, as I am an ordinary Golang developer I was able to ask it to put in a retry on error (also some important glue) when using WASM from a web app (this staved a minor amount of googling):\n\nWASM seems surpremely useful, and ChatGPT, while terrifying on one level, looks like it can really take away some of the grind work from developers, allowing us to move much faster into more platforms. And no, this post was NOT written by ChatGPT, but by a human.",

This means that as a liquidity provider, your business can be the backend supplier in several payment applications.\n\nPerforming KYC on repeat customers every time they attempt to transact with you from a different payment app would be a pain. To avoid this, you will use the Web5 SDK to issue a Known Customer Credential (KCC) to a customer, Alice, who you have already completed KYC on. You will store the JWT representing the KCC in Alice’s Decentralized Web Node so that she can present it to your business from any payment app.\n\nAt TBD, we are committed to building a decentralized future where users have greater control over their data and organizations can interact in a more open, trustworthy, and secure way. Open standards are the foundation of this vision, enabling the seamless collaboration and interoperability across systems.\n\nEverything we do at TBD is enabled and strengthened by open standards. Our most notable projects, Web5 and tbDEX, are deeply rooted in these open standards. The frameworks for decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs), and the protocols that facilitate their sharing form the backbone of our work.\n\n\"Verifiable Credentials seems niche. Only a small group of technologists would be interested in this,\" a conference attendee declared after I enthusiastically described my company's work in the Global Payments and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) ecosystem.\n\nThis comment gave me pause. Less than a year ago, I first encountered Verifiable Credentials (VCs) - a W3C standard for digital credentials that state specific facts about individuals, organizations, or entities. My initial reaction was similar to the conference attendee’s response. However, after interviewing SSI builders on a weekly livestream, my perspective changed dramatically.\n\nWhile VCs are relatively new and primarily explored by SSI enthusiasts, their benefits extend far beyond this group. Many of the services and products you use today already rely on them – even if you don't realize it.\n\nFrom healthcare to content creation, finance to travel, VCs are changing how we share and verify information. Here's a look at seven real-world applications of VCs that may surprise you:\n\nWhen blockchain technology was first introduced a decade and a half ago, it made the possibility of a decentralized web seem viable to a mass audience. Since then, blockchains have proven themselves to be a poor solution to the majority of data storage problems outside of bearer assets - i.e. Bitcoin - because blockchains grow continuously without any ability to delete data, which just doesn’t make sense for things like personal data. But ‘blockchain’ isn’t synonymous with decentralization, and just because a blockchain isn’t the best solution for personal data storage doesn’t mean your app can’t be decentralized.\n\nDigital identity shapes every facet of our online interactions.

      "# [DID DHT: Ready For Primetime by Gabe Cohen on 2024-04-08](https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht/)\nDigital identity shapes every facet of our online interactions. The quest for a system that balances decentralization, scalability, security, and user experience has been relentless. Today, I'm thrilled to share that TBD has birthed a new solution: the DID DHT method. This leap forward is not just a technical achievement; it's a foundational component for the more inclusive and trust-based digital world we want for tomorrow.\n\nThe specification is nearing its first major version, and our team has produced client software in all of our open source SDKs in more than five languages. We have also built and deployed a publicly-available developer gateway, which has already registered many thousands of DIDs, with staging and production-ready gateways coming soon.\n\nSome of you may already be familiar with DID DHT and why we’ve chosen to make it our default DID method, but if not, or if you’re curious to find out more, read on to learn more about how the method was created, and how we’ve ended up here today.\n\nOur vision for a superior DID method hinged on several critical features:\n\nSufficient Decentralization — a foundational principle to mitigate censorship and enhance user autonomy.\n\nScalability and Accessibility – making digital identity accessible to billions, without a prohibitive cost barrier.\n\nComprehensive Feature Set — supporting multiple cryptographic key types, services, and other core DID properties.\n\nReliable and Verifiable History — enabling trust through transparency historical data.\n\nGlobal Discoverability – facilitating easy access and independent verification of digital identifiers.\n\nHistorically our software has supported did :key, did :web, and did :ion, and some other methods within certain segments of our stack. Recognizing the impracticality of a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach, we embraced a multi-method strategy. Today that strategy incorporates three key DID methods: did :jwk, did :web, and did :dht, each catering to specific scenarios with their unique strengths.\n\nWithin our SDKs, JWK replaces did :key , a simple and widely adopted method that uses standard JSON Web Keys (JWKs), limiting complexity over did :key ’s approach to using multi-formats. DID Web is an obvious choice for entities with existing brands, as trust can be easily linked to existing domains without the use of any special or complex technology. DID DHT is a new method that we view as a replacement for ION, which has strong decentralization characteristics, a robust feature set, and a simpler architecture.\n\nThe biggest change we’ve made is going from ION to DID DHT.\n\nION is a Sidetree-based DID method that is a L2 on the Bitcoin blockchain. ION is a fully-featured DID method, and one of the few that supports root key rotation and discoverability of all DIDs with complete historical state. However, there are three main reasons that led us to move away from using ION — architectural complexity, centralization risk, and a sub-optimal user experience.\n\nWhile ION presented a robust DID method with admirable features, its complexity, centralization risks, and user experience challenges prompted us to explore alternatives. DID DHT stands out as our choice for a new direction, offering simplicity, enhanced decentralization, and a user-friendly approach without compromising on the core features essential for a comprehensive DID method.\n\nDID DHT is built upon Pkarr, a community-created project. Pkarr stands for Public Key Addressable Resource Records and acts as a bridge between our DID method and the Mainline Decentralized Hash Table, overlaying DNS record semantics and providing a space-efficient encoding mechanism for DID Documents. The choice of Mainline DHT, with its over 20 million active nodes and a 15-year successful run, guarantees exceptional decentralization out of mainline nodes, but can also leverage Pkarr nodes and DID DHT gateways for additional functionality.\n\nDID DHT trades off use of a blockchain for immediate decentralization, fast publishing and resolution, and trustless verification. That’s right — the DID Document’s records are signed by its own key before entering the DHT — there’s no need to trust nodes, as you can verify payloads yourself client-side. Similar to ION, DID DHT documents support multiple keys, services, type indexing, and other DID Document properties.\n\nDID DHT, however, is not without its limitations. The main three being: a need to republish records to nodes regularly to prevent them from expiring from the DHT and reliance on a non-rotatable Ed25519 key called the “identity key,” as is required by the DHT and BEP44, and historical DID state not being shared between nodes. Our ongoing development and the community-driven enhancements aim to address these challenges, refining DID DHT's architecture for broader applicability and reliability.\n\nOne of the most interesting opportunities we have identified for DID DHT is interoperability with existing single-key methods like did :key and did :jwk. Essentially, you can continue to use single-key methods as you do today, with an optional resolution step to the DHT to extend the functionality of these methods, like adding additional keys or service(s) to a DID Document. We have begun to define this interoperability in the method’s registry.\n\nAnother interesting opportunity for DID DHT is with the W3C DID working group, which is currently going through a rechartering effort to focus on interoperability and DID Resolution. Depending on how the charter ends up, there could be an opportunity to promote the DID DHT method as one that is broadly interoperable, decentralized, and does not necessitate the use of a blockchain — a common critique of DIDs by community members in the past.\n\nWe have additional ideas such as associating human-readable names with DIDs, tying DIDs into trust and discoverability services, and supporting gossip between DID DHT gateways. We encourage you to join us on GitHub to continue the discussion.\n\nThe introduction of DID DHT represents a significant milestone in our journey toward a more decentralized, accessible, and secure digital identity landscape. We believe DID DHT has the characteristics to make it widely useful, and widely adopted. Try it out for yourself, and let us know what you think.\n\nAs we continue to refine and expand its capabilities, we invite the community to join us in this endeavor, contributing insights, feedback, and innovations to shepherd DID DHT toward becoming your default DID method.",
      "# [Beyond Blockchain: How Web5 Enables Fully Decentralized Apps by Chris Giglio on 2024-04-23](https://developer.tbd.website/blog/decentralized-apps/)\nWhen blockchain technology was first introduced a decade and a half ago, it made the possibility of a decentralized web seem viable to a mass audience. Since then, blockchains have proven themselves to be a poor solution to the majority of data storage problems outside of bearer assets - i.e. Bitcoin - because blockchains grow continuously without any ability to delete data, which just doesn’t make sense for things like personal data. But ‘blockchain’ isn’t synonymous with decentralization, and just because a blockchain isn’t the best solution for personal data storage doesn’t mean your app can’t be decentralized.\n\nThere are two common problems when trying to port a traditional centralized application over to the blockchain: data efficiency and data custody. In this post we’ll discuss why those two problems are blockers for most applications, and how Web5 components allow developers to build performant decentralized applications in a way that wasn't possible before.\n\nIt’s possible to make the argument that data such as GIS coordinates, historical data, or widely-used and immutable data are good candidates to be stored on the blockchain because there’s no need for deletion and a requirement for complete history. While blockchain isn’t the only storage method that meets the needs of these systems, those systems are the ones best suited to utilize blockchain. Despite that fact that those data are good candidates for blockchain, however, does not mean that blockchain is the best data storage solution for that data.\n\nHowever, blockchains are continuous ledgers of data that provide the benefit of immutability at the cost of storage inefficiency, which means that they aren’t great for storing large amounts of data or data sets in which there are large subsections of trivial or ignorable data. Firstly, their read times are slower than traditional data storage because the entire blockchain needs to be traversed for a read, and write times require settlement onto the blockchain which is out of an individual’s hands. As a result, the cost per transaction will likely be significantly higher on the blockchain when compared to traditional data storage, and that cost can grow over time.\n\nImagine an on-chain photo storage app that allows for users to encrypt their data. While this framework would technically allow for the replacement of large-scale cloud-based photo services that are run by centralized corporations, the end user experience would be tarnished by much slower speeds than what users have come to expect. That’s because blockchains are designed to store an immutable ledger of transactions (in this case uploads of photos), and knowing what photos belong to who would involve traversing the entirety of the blockchain. Queries to this kind of data storage are slow and expensive, as would be the proof-of-work or other verification method needed to add new blocks to the chain. As a result, while a photo sharing app, or any app that requires storage of large files, is theoretically possible on-chain, it isn’t very scalable or performant.\n\nA key tenet to the decentralized web is the idea of custody, or data ownership. Custody, or the ability to hold an asset in which only you have full access to it, breaks down into a handful of concerns including:\n\nPhysical storage ownership\n\nDeletion prevention\n\nCensorship resistance\n\nSpeed of use\n\nData interoperability\n\nA truly decentralized web makes it easy for each user to custody their own data, regardless of their reasoning for doing so. No matter a customer’s “why,” however, custody isn’t simply a matter of personal beliefs - it’s a feature that enables better user experience.\n\nWith blockchain technology, wallets don’t actually store your data - instead they address to your data on the blockchain via the public/private keys they hold and represent. This means, for example, that a crypto wallet doesn’t actually “store” your Bitcoins; it’s an address that is used as the identifier on transactions recorded on-chain, which can then be used to determine your wallet’s Bitcoin holdings.\n\nIn order to take custody of your on-chain data then you would need to run your own node on the blockchain network in question, which may not be a good solution for the average consumer. Additionally, in order to host a wallet that is available on all of your devices, that wallet will likely be hosted on a centralized third party’s servers.\n\nIt’s important to note that while the issues of wallet storage and running nodes aren’t unsolvable problems, they are inherently outside of the definitions of what a typical blockchain wallet does today.\n\nBearing in mind the limitations of custody and efficiency, it becomes clear that not a lot of data makes sense to be stored on-chain. However, just because you might not want to store important, large data like photos, or small, unimportant data like favicon history on-chain doesn’t mean that it isn’t possible to store that data in a decentralized way that offers custody and efficiency.\n\nKey Web5 technologies like Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs), and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) in supplement or in place of blockchain provide a framework for an internet that is both decentralized AND solves the issues we’ve discussed that blockchain alone can’t solve. It’s important to note that while the integration of these technologies with existing blockchain ecosystems isn’t unheard of, they are able to solve the issues with blockchain discussed above. Cumulatively, they offer a way to efficiently address data, store and replicate data in a decentralized manner, and maintain identity.\n\nA purely blockchain-focused wallet, as discussed previously, is simply a key pairing with an address that references ownership over transactions on the blockchain but doesn’t actually manage local or cloud storage. This means that any on-chain data, while decentralized, isn’t user-custodied unless they set up a node on the network in which they’re participating, which is something that in a blockchain context should happen in a separate app from the wallet.\n\nIn Web5, however, wallets are addressed via DIDs and are able to store data via DWeb Nodes - which can live on device and replicate storage remotely - rather than relying on storing everything on-chain or on the wallet developer’s cloud storage option. Because Web5 wallets are more robust than simply a wallet that connects to a blockchain, your Web5 wallet could theoretically manage running a blockchain node for you in addition to performing more standard “wallet” tasks like you might expect.\n\nAdditionally, because DWNs are able to replicate data across instances on different devices, it makes for self-custodying your data across devices much easier than with a blockchain wallet. While blockchain wallets require re-creating the private key pairings on another device and can pose a security risk, DIDs also offer ways to easily and securely port your DID between devices to replicate data and maintain a consistent user experience. You can imagine how great this is in the case of a photo storage app that is backed by a DWN that replicates data across your devices and makes sign-in on those devices easy!\n\nWhile blockchain wallets and Web5 wallets aren’t mutually exclusive - Web5 wallets can very well interact with blockchains and blockchain wallets may use concepts like DIDs and VCs -, what matters is that when users take advantage of wallet apps using DIDs, DWNs, and VCs, they can self-custody all their off-chain data and even their on-chain data should they be able to run a node locally.\n\nLedgers like the blockchain don’t make for performant databases in a lot of use cases, which is why DWNs are a breakthrough in combining decentralized web technologies with centralized web performance. While blockchains require ledger consensus and redundant storage to hold any type of data, DWNs are replicable nodes that can run any of the traditionally performant database technologies you’re used to - think SQL, MongoDB, etc. - without being tied to a centralized server.\n\nAs mentioned in our discussion about custody, you could run a DWN on your laptop, your phone, on your own server, or on rented server space from a cloud provider, and all of them can be synchronized to provide the kind of redundancy that we love about blockchain. As a result, DWNs are able to solve the problems of large file storage and off-chain storage.\n\nA performant decentralized web that offers users custody of their own data has been a tantalizing dream for almost two decades, but in that same timeframe blockchain technology has proven to not be the way to make that vision a reality. If you find yourself or your customers valuing decentralization, privacy, flexibility, and self-custodial apps, then Web5 provides the framework to achieve exactly those goals. Your Web5 app may very well leverage blockchain technology - a participating financial institution on the tbDEX protocol we’re developing is a great example of an app that uses Web5 tech to connect to blockchains, but there are lots of ways to build dApps with Web5.",

      "# [Self Sovereign Identity, TBD, and Web5 by Gabe Cohen on 2022-08-26](https://developer.tbd.website/blog/ssi-tbd-web5/)\nSelf-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is an umbrella term well-detailed by Christopher Allen, and inspired by many in the Identity community before him, in his 2016 blog post: The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity, which identifies Ten Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity:\n\nExistence. Users must have an independent existence.\n\nControl. Users must control their identities.\n\nAccess. Users must have access to their own data.\n\nTransparency. Systems and algorithms must be transparent.\n\nPersistence. Identities must be long-lived.\n\nPortability. Information and services about identity must be transportable.\n\nInteroperability. Identities should be as widely usable as possible.\n\nConsent. Users must agree to the use of their identity.\n\nMinimalization. Disclosure of claims must be minimized.\n\nProtection. The rights of users must be protected.\n\nSince 2016, a lot has happened! There have been a flurry of conventions, discussions, papers, standards, software, and industry wide adoption of technology based on the principles of SSI. The space is at its most mature, and only growing.\n\nBlock’s mission is economic empowerment. Historically, this has looked like building products and offering services such as Square, enabling millions of merchants to take payments, manage staff, and conduct business in-store and online, and CashApp, which enables millions, especially the un and under-banked to send, spend, bank, and invest their money (and Bitcoin!). When TBD, a new business unit at Block formed in 2021, we expanded on Block’s mission, setting out to help create a decentralized future that returns ownership and control over your finances, data, and identity. TBD’s mission is strongly aligned with the principles of SSI.\n\nTo facilitate our mission, TBD launched Web5: a decentralized platform that provides a new identity layer for the web to enable decentralized apps and protocols. Web5 takes SSI concepts, standards, and software and provides them as an opinionated bundle to enable all that self-sovereignty and digital identity has to offer. What TBD is building for Web5 has a number of components today, and more tomorrow. Among those are the Self-Sovereign Identity SDK and Self-Sovereign Identity Service (SSI SDK, and SSI Service), Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN), and Identity Wallets. At the time of writing, all of these components are under active development. This was an intentional move by the team to adopt an ‘open-by-default’ model, and include the community in the development of Web5 from the beginning.\n\nHere we’ll lay out the vision for a key component of Web5: Self-Sovereign Identity. Specifically, how we at TBD are building standards based software in a community towards the goals of SSI and Web5. The two “SSI” named projects — the SSI Service and SSI SDK — sit along side Decentralized Web Nodes, Identity Wallets, User Interfaces, and much more — but focus on a set of standards-based building blocks of the Web5 stack.\n\nTBD is developing open source, standards-based software to facilitate Self-Sovereign Identity on Web5.\n\nThe vision of SSI is realized via Open Standards. Crucially, these standards are accessible to all: to view and to contribute. You may not be aware of it, but you interact with Open Standards every day: whether via web browsers, hardware you use and their underlying protocols, programming languages, audio files, internet and bluetooth devices, text documents, chat applications, encryption you use and so much more. Open Standards facilitate nearly every aspect of modern computation.\n\nIn the SSI space there a number of standards bodies that facilitate SSI-standard development. Though we may utilize specifications in multiple organizations such as the IETF, OpenID Foundation, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), and Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF). TBD’s focus thus far has been primarily with the W3C and DIF organizations:\n\nThe W3C, founded by Tim Berners-Lee in 1994, is one of the most prominent international standards organizations for the web. The W3C has a number of group types. Community Groups are the most open. The Credentials Community Group focused on Verifiable Credentials, and often serves as a staging ground for the Verifiable Credentials Working Group, responsible for the Verifiable Credentials Data Model (i.e. the Verifiable Credentials specification). The Decentralized Identifier Working Group is responsible for Decentralized Identifiers (i.e. the DID specification).\n\nTBD is a member of the W3C, actively utilizes the work items from all three groups, and has made contributions to each group’s corpus.\n\nThe Decentralized Identity Foundation, or DIF, was founded in 2017 to focus on Decentralized Identity. Since then, it’s expanded to house a number of working groups around Identifiers, Claims & Credentials, Sidetree, Secure Data Storage, Wallet Security, Interoperability, and more. DIF produces technical specifications, reference implementations (as in the case of Sidetree and ION), and coordinates standards and software implementations for players across the industry.\n\nTBD is a member of DIF, regularly attends working groups, contributing to both interoperability projects, specifications, and technical implementations.\n\nThe set of standards we rely on and use for Web5 is unbound. However, we have a good sense of the standards we begin with. The list below will likely soon be out of date. Consider it as a reference as you orient yourself with what we’re working with.\n\nSpecificationStandards BodyDescriptionStatusDID CoreW3C Decentralized Identifier Working GroupDecentralized Identifiers v1.0.RecommendationDID IONDIF SidetreeA layer 2 Decentralized Identifier network that runs atop the Bitcion blockchain, built on the Sidetree protocol.Ratified SpecificationDID KeyW3C CCGA simple method to create a DID using a single cryptographic key.Unofficial DraftDID WebW3C CCGA DID method that allows bootstrapping trust using a web domain.W3C Internal DocumentDID PeerDIF Identifiers & DiscoveryA DID method that can be used independent of any central source of truth, intended to be “cheap, fast, scalable, and secure.”DraftVerifiable Credentials Data ModelW3C Verifiable Credentials Working GroupThe Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1.RecommendationData IntegrityW3C Verifiable Credentials Working GroupDescribes mechanisms for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of structured digital documents…such as digital signatures.Editor’s DraftJSON Web Signature 2020W3C Verifiable Credentials Working GroupA cryptographic suite for the purpose of creating and verifying proofs for JSON Web Signatures using Linked Data Proofs.Editor’s DraftVerifiable Credentials JSON SchemaW3C CCGA mechanism to use JSON schemas to back a Verifiable Credential.DraftStatus List 2021W3C CCGA privacy-preserving, space-efficient, and high-performance mechanism for publishing status information such as suspension or revocation of Verifiable Credentials.Draft Community Group ReportVC Proof Format Test SuiteDIF Claims & CredentialsA test suite providing interoperability testing and reporting for Verifiable Credentials and Presentation for Linked Data and JWT signature types.Unofficial DraftPresentation ExchangeDIF Claims & CredentialsA claim format and transport envelope agnostic format for Verifiers to articulate proof requirements, and for Holders to describe proofs according to those requirements.Working Group DraftCredential ManifestDIF Claims & CredentialsA common data format for describing the inputs a Subject must provide to an Issuer for evaluation and issuance of credentials, a means for a Subject to submit an application against those requirements, and a means for an Issuer to fulfill such an application.Pre-DraftTrust EstablishmentDIF Claims & CredentialsA means of communicating trust statements and relations between parties in decentralized identity environments.Pre-DraftDecentralized Web NodeDIF Secure Data StorageA DWN is a data storage and message relay mechanism entities can use to locate public or private permissioned data related to a given DID. DWNs provide multi-node sync, enabling the owning entity to secure, manage, and transact their data with others without centralizing factors.Draft\n\nFor brevity, I only included fifteen of the most prominent specifications comprising the foundations of the SSI stack in Web5. There are at least another half dozen either included or planned to be included in our software.\n\nTBD is interested in building a space for community-driven projects, community members gaining merge and moderation access to community resources, and growing a diverse set of contributors interested in a broad set of use cases to be built on Web5.\n\nWe are not interested in becoming a standards body itself. Instead, we are focused on fostering a self-sustaining community focused on building and building on Web5. To facilitate this, we can expand our existing tools like adding sections of our Forums, creating new Discord channels, creating new purpose-specific GitHub repositories and investing in new tools for collaboration like an ideas board, job listing page, or a Web5 wiki. I’d love to see a Web5 incubator similar to Y Combinator that facilitates those building on Web5. The future’s possibilities are endless, and we are eager to adapt to the evolving needs of the community.\n\nSometimes, we may need more rigorous structure. As such, we are interested in forming working groups in the Web5 community where it makes sense. The output of these groups could be industry coordination, use-case building, software development, or even standards-related work that can be contributed to existing standards bodies. TBD has kicked off one such group to date around Credentials, first focused on creating a path for Know Your Customer (KYC) Credentials. This group already follows such a pattern: having built out use-case documentation in GitHub, having a purpose-specific Discord channel, and forum category. Soon we’ll adapt this group to a more “office hours”-style format, allowing anyone in the community to show off their work, ask for assistance, and help shape our project development roadmaps.\n\nToday we have one GitHub org, run by the TBD team. We will open up roles for community management. Creating light processes for community-driven moderation and maintenance (e.g. managing pull requests, issues, labels, and milestones), in addition to having projects and repositories started and managed entirely by members of the community. One such idea we are considering is for a new GitHub organization for the “Web5 Community” to foster and highlight community-driven efforts. We’re additionally looking to launch an Incubation program that gives a formal path towards recognizing and promoting the work that begins in a grassroots manner in our community. We plan on making the rest of our tooling community-driven as well: today this means Discord and the Forums, tomorrow it will be a lot more!\n\nWhile this is something we are focused on internally, it is crucial that you as community members are able to make suggestions, plans, and directly influence change. Reach out on Discord, our Forums, gain mindshare for your ideas, and we will help make them a reality.\n\nThe foundations of Web5 are open source. This means that its source code is publicly available and, as stewards, we rely on external contribution—Web5 is only successful with the full innovation of a global community. Certainly there are cases where code cannot be open source for various reasons: this applies to the TBD business as well as members of our community. We do not mandate open source, but it is a guiding principle. We believe in the power of open, and all that comes with it. The more open Web5 can be, the better it will be.\n\nProjects in the TBD GitHub may originate at TBD, or through the community (on our Discord, Forums). Today, the TBD team is acting as the primary steward and maintainer of all projects. As the community matures, we expect it to take the lead and for TBD to assume a higher-level maintainer role. We imagine this ends up looking like more community-driven projects, community members gaining merge and moderation access, and growing a diverse set of contributors interested in a broad set of use cases to be built on Web5. More broadly, we want to push forward to a world where TBD does not have the only, or final say on any Web5 decision: decentralization is a strength in the development of Web5.\n\nThis transition is only made possible by active engagement from the community. It is the reason our code is open, and we have set up avenues for engagement. We look towards the community to engage with TBD and others, and push for the future we wish to see built.\n\nTBD is fostering a set of community-driven, open source, standards-based software to facilitate Self-Sovereign Identity on Web5.\n\nWe want to realize the vision of the Web5 community: to build pragmatic standards-based software that serves a wide variety of needs. The software shall not be tied to any specific entity, nor, without good reason, exclude possibilities within the SSI space. Balancing both feature-richness and complexity we must work closely with our users to design software that meets the needs of all who wish to be on Web5. We think in terms of toolkits, composed of the purpose-specific tools in them. These toolkits exist in a hierarchy of abstractions from which powerful, intuitive, and human-centric software can be built.\n\nThe software must be designed in a flexible, modular manner. This means interfaces that feature a default implementation or two, but can be extended to facilitate integration into many systems (e.g. swapping out databases, encryption methods, credential formats as needed). The software is intended to be built on open standards in the SSI space. The standards space is fast-changing and there may be cases where we use ill-defined and ill-supported standards; we must be able to favor practicality and working implementations over robust standards with a commitment to see the standards through. There may be cases where we use our software to innovate past the current state of these standards and open the opportunity to contribute back to existing standards and standards bodies.\n\nWe recognize that the SSI ecosystem is full of competing and developing standards. Often this can feel like developing against a set of moving targets and promises of feature sets. There’s a lot of information to grok and everyone has an opinion—this is a good thing! It can be difficult to pick winners, and even more difficult to choose between multiple standards that appear to do the same thing: we do not want to create a Swiss Army knife that contains five different types of scissors, we’d rather it contain one (or maybe two) scissors that get the job done well 99% of the time. We favor evaluating the addition of features and standards on a case-by-case basis, and looking towards implementations of standards and features that are well-reasoned, with committed developers. Bonus points if there is already demonstrated usage and interoperability.\n\nWe also recognize that the SSI ecosystem uses a wide set of tools, languages, and technologies: working across web browsers, mobile applications, backend servers, ledgers, and more. For languages we’ve started with Go (for the SSI SDK and SSI Service) because of its robust cryptographic support, speed, ability to be compiled to WASM, and, above all else, simplicity. It is crucial that the code we write is approachable to encourage contribution. Simple and clear is always preferred over clever. The future is multi-language, and multi-platform. We welcome initiatives for improving multi-language and multi-platform support, and are open to fostering them into our GitHub organization.\n\nNamed ssi-sdk, this SDK encapsulates a set of standards related to Self-Sovereign Identity. The ssi-sdk intends to provide flexible functionality based on a set of standards-based primitives for building decentralized identity applications in a modular manner: with limited dependencies between components.\n\nPrimarily, the SDK serves to support Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials and their associated standards. Interacting with Decentralized Identifiers: resolving identifiers, signing, verifying, encrypting, and decrypting data using cryptographic keys found in DID Documents. Interacting with Verifiable Credentials: creating and using data schemas, facilitating credential application, issuance, and exchange.\n\nThe SDK is an active work in progress, and can be found on the TBD GitHub.\n\nThe Self-Sovereign Identity Service (SSIS) facilitates all things relating to DIDs and Verifiable Credentials — in a box! The service is a part of a larger Decentralized Web Platform architecture. The SSI Service is a JSON-API web service that wraps the ssi-sdk to facilitate user-focused interactions on Web5. The service is intended to interact with user interfaces, wallets, decentralized web nodes, and other web infrastructure.\n\nBy taking the lower-level building blocks exposed by the SDK, the service is intended to drastically lower the barrier to entry for any individual or organization interesting in building on the Web5 stack. Like the SDK, it is agnostic to any specific business or use case, and design to be pluggable into external infrastructure whether existing or new.\n\nThe service is assumed to be run by a single organization and assumes external authentication and authorization. The service assumes no infrastructure requirements and is flexible to multiple deployment models, databases, key management solutions, and user interfaces. We expect that a wide array of users and use cases will use and build on top of the service, creating layers of abstraction and intermediation for processing business logic, handling user accounts, and so on.\n\nThe service is an active work in progress, and can be found on the TBD GitHub.\n\nWe are in the early days of Web5. By intention, we’ve announced our ideas and projects way before they are ready for an alpha release, let alone inclusion in a production-ready application. Transparency is an asset in sharing our thinking and gaining mindshare for what we are building. As such, there are many forks in the road fast-approaching. To move past these forks, and the forks after those I introduce some light process to guide principled decision making:\n\nFeatures shall be developed using the Socratic method: making statements, interrogating them, asking whys and hows, being intellectually honest with risk, uncertainty, consider second, third and n-order effects.\n\nAll new feature proposals shall include a light design document outlining desired functionality, end-user utility, prior art, room for improvement and next steps, risks and mitigations, considerations, and open questions.\n\nA quorum of project maintainers shall review and progress feature proposals in a timely manner.\n\nTemplates for the aforementioned process have been created on each GitHub repository. I encourage you to create GitHub issues and Forum discussions to explore thinking, and revise designs before going forth with a contribution.\n\nFor templates on feature development, philosophies on versioning and releases, and more information view our GitHub documentation:\n\nSSI Service GitHub Docs | SSI SDK GitHub Docs\n\nI believe in setting public and ambitious measurable goals. This serves as a powerful self-discipline mechanism, as well as a call to action for forward progress. Officially the timeline for Web5 can be found on our site. Unofficially, here is my ambition:\n\nBy January 1st 2023 the following shall be true:\n\nThe first beta release of the SSI SDK and SSI Service (0.1.0) will be released.\n\nEach SSI project will have >75% test coverage.\n\nEach project will have robust user and developer documentation with clear examples.\n\nThe SSI SDK will have feature complete specification implementations for at least all fifteen standards identified above.\n\nThe SSI Service will be deployable in an infrastructure-agnostic manner, demonstrated on ≥ 2 platforms.\n\nThe SSI Service will facilitate practical end-user flows facilitating:\n\nCreating and managing DIDs using ≥ 2 DID methods\n\nCreating and issuing Verifiable Credentials backed by JSON schemas\n\nCreating Credential Manifests, accepting Credential Applications, and fulfilling Credential Applications\n\nCreating Presentation Definitions, sending Presentation Requests, and accepting Presentation Submissions\n\nCreating Credential Revocations and checking Credentials against them\n\nCreating and processing Trust Establishment documents\n\nThe SSI SDK and Service will support the Decentralized Web Node specification and the Service will work with at least one DWN.\n\nYou should now have a pretty good sense of how we conceive of SSI software on Web5, and how its journey will unfold. Most importantly the mission is not TBD’s alone, it is that of the community. We build real software for real people and favor pragmatism above all else. What I’ve written here is current thinking and is always subject to evolution—with your help. I’m looking forward to you joining us in pushing SSI and Web5 forward, gaining new perspectives, solving new use-cases, and building some cool shit.",
      "# [Who Really Owns Your Social Media Handles? by Ebony Louis on 2023-08-11](https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-social-handles/)\nIn today’s age of social media dominance, our online identities have become integral to both our personal lives and professional endeavors. From connecting with friends and family to building brands and businesses, platforms like Twitter and Instagram have given us the power to create digital personas that resonate with others where your user handle serves as a unique identifier in the digital world.\n\nHowever, recent incidents have shed light on a fundamental question: Do we truly own our user handles on these platforms? Events, such as Twitter's rebranding and the subsequent takeover of the @X handle from a longtime user, shed light on the intricate web of ownership, accountability that revolves around these usernames, and how account models across the web work today.\n\nUser handles, also known as usernames, are a string of characters that represent your digital presence on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. While users assume that the handles they create are tied to their accounts, the reality is more complex, often dictated by the terms of service set by the platform. These terms outline the rights and limitations users have over their usernames/accounts, establishing a virtual \"landlord and tenant\" relationship between you and the platform provider.\n\nThis relationship was exemplified when Twitter rebranded as \"X,\" causing collateral damage as the company took repossession of user handles like @X, without notice or monetary compensation. This was echoed in cases like @Music, which was created by a user who curated their digital presence with this handle for more than 16 years.\n\nThe notice from Twitter to this account holder reads:\n\nThe user handle associated with account @Music will be affiliated with X Corp. Accordingly, your user handle will be changed to a new user handle.\n\nWhile this is certainly alarming, it’s not illegal. Most people don’t read the fine print of the Terms of Service agreements when joining these applications, and therefore don’t realize how much control these centralized organizations have over our data and digital identity.\n\nThe way the web stands today, each time we engage with online platforms that require accounts, we borrow an identity from them and then proceed to build a reputation and possibly a brand associated with this borrowed identity. The recent turmoil experienced by Twitter has thrust the very nature of the web into the spotlight for those who previously might not have contemplated its issues. This is precisely why Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) bear immense significance.\n\nAt the core of Web5's paradigm lie DIDs, which serve as identities that users own and control. DIDs provide individuals with distinctive, universally resolvable identifiers that persist through time and consistently remain under their control. Unlike conventional usernames, DIDs can't be confiscated by platforms, thus empowering users to truly possess their digital identities. This transformative shift adds an identity layer to the web eradicating platform-mediated handles.\n\nFortunately, Twitter automatically gave the user who created @X a new (albeit way less cool) handle. However, what if the company simply closed that account instead? The user would have lost not just their username, but potentially their entire digital existence on that platform if their profile had been wiped out.\n\nWhile Twitter's actions towards these users might not have violated any legal boundaries, is this the way we truly want the web to be? Social media has transcended its original purpose of mere social interaction; it now intertwines with our livelihoods. When signing up for a new platform many of us adopt the same usernames. These usernames serve as both personal and professional branding tools, encapsulating not just our individual identities but also the essence of our businesses.\n\nWeb5 will revolutionize identity management by restoring it to us, the users, while allowing applications to focus solely on enhancing our user experience.\n\nIndustry leaders Angie Jones, Kelsey Hightower, and Daniel Buchner discussed this very topic on a recent Twitter Space. Tune in to hear their thoughts on how Decentralized Identity solves this problem.",
      "# [Onboarding](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/tbdex/pfi/onboarding/)\nBefore beginning development of your PFI’s code, you’ll need to create an identity to use on the network. A tbDEX network is built to be decentralized, which is why you’ll need to create your own Decentralized Identifier (DID) to assign to the PFI. That DID will represent the PFI, as well as serve as the signer for tbDEX messages and resources that are sent to other parties.\n\nDIDs are associated with DID Documents which describe how to engage with your PFI.\n\nTo create a DID and identify yourself as a PFI, use the web5/dids package:\n\nJavaScript\n\nKotlin\n\nSwift\n\nFor a DID to be recognized as a PFI, it is important to include a service endpoint in the DID document. The value for serviceEndpoint should be the URL to your PFI's service entry.\n\nIf you also have an existing key management system to secure your secrets e.g AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS etc, creating a DID provides a keyManager interface that you can pass it through.",

      "# [What is Web5? by Angie Jones on 2022-07-01](https://developer.tbd.website/blog/what-is-web5/)\nWeb 5 is a decentralized platform that provides a new identity layer for the web to enable decentralized apps and protocols.\n\nIn the current web model, users do not own their data or identity. They are given accounts by companies and their data is held captive in app silos. To create a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center, we must empower them with self-owned identity and restore control over their data.\n\nThere are three main pillars of the decentralized web platform, all of which are based on open standards.\n\nThe identifiers we know and use today are owned by the government, a company, an organization, or some other intermediary. For example, our email addresses and social media handles are identifiers associated with us but are owned and controlled by the service providers. These companies have the right to ban, disable, or delete these identifiers and we have little to no control over this.\n\nSo before we can realize truly decentralized applications, we need decentralized identifiers that users own and control. This removes the dependency on centralized entities to authenticate and represent us.\n\n​​Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a W3C standard. They have a standardized structure that essentially links to you and your information.\n\nThey are a long string of text that consists of three parts:\n\nthe URI scheme identifier, which is did\n\nthe identifier for a DID method\n\nthe DID method-specific identifier\n\nStoring DIDs on ION (a Layer 2 DID network that runs on top of Bitcoin) is a preferred design decision for the implementation of Web 5. ION is a decentralized replacement for DNS for identity identifiers, so there are no authorities, coordinators, tokens, or other centralized bottleneck.\n\nDIDs are the only component of Web5 that touch a blockchain, which is generally limited to anchoring the keys/endpoints linked to the ID.\n\nThat being said, anchoring DIDs on Bitcoin (or any blockchain) is not a requirement. In fact, what's great about having the standardized formatting for DIDs is that they can be anchored anywhere or not anchored at all and this still works, although with varying levels of decentralization.\n\nHere are examples of DIDs on the Bitcoin blockchain, the Ethereum blockchain, and the web. Notice they all use the same format: scheme, DID method, and DID method-specific identifier.\n\nBecause personal data is not stored on the blockchain, the DID essentially acts as a URI that associates the subject of the DID (the person, company, or object being identified) with a DID document that lives off-chain.\n\nDID Documents are JSON files stored in decentralized storage systems such as IPFS, and describe how to interact with the DID subject. The DID Document contains things like the DID subject's public keys, authentication and verification methods, and service endpoints that reference the locations of the subject’s data.\n\nVerifiable Credentials are a fully ratified W3C standard that work hand in hand with Decentralized Identifiers to enable trustless interactions - meaning two parties do not need to trust one another to engage, but claims made about a DID subject can be verified.\n\nFor example, Alice needs to prove she has a bank account at Acme Bank. Acme Bank issues a cryptographically signed Verifiable Credential which would be stored in Alice's identity wallet.\n\nThe credential contains the issuer as Acme and the subject as Alice, as well as the claims, which are Alice's account number and full name.\n\nUpon request for proof of banking, Alice presents the Verifiable Credential that's cryptographically signed by both Alice as well as her bank.\n\nThis is an easy, machine-readable way to share credentials across the web. The Verifier does not know or trust Alice, but they do consider Acme trustworthy, and they have essentially vouched for Alice therefore distributing trust.\n\nToday, centralized entities act as our data stores. Applications hold all of our content and preferences on their servers.\n\nDecentralized Web Nodes (DWNs) change this by allowing us to decouple our data from the applications that we use, and instead host our data ourselves in our own personal data stores.\n\nBlueSky is a good example; it's a decentralized version of Twitter that's in the works. With BlueSky, your tweets and your connections aren't stored with the application. They are stored with you. So you can present your content on any decentralized social media app you want, not just BlueSky.\n\nYour DWNs can hold both public and encrypted data. For example, in the case of a decentralized version of Twitter, you'd want data like your tweets and your connections to be public but things like your DMs to be private.\n\nYour decentralized web nodes do not live on the blockchain. You can host your web nodes anywhere (your phone, computer, etc) and can replicate them across your devices and clouds and all data will be synced.\n\nWhile self-hosting your DWNs provides a means for decentralizing your data, we recognize some users will be more comfortable with others hosting their web nodes for convenience sake. We envision there will be vendors offering to host your web nodes for you. The good part about that is you can encrypt any private data so unlike today where cloud hosts can scan everything that you host there, you can still maintain some privacy even if you have your web nodes hosted by intermediaries.\n\nYour DWNs are associated with your Decentralized Identifiers and are listed in a DID document.\n\nNotice the serviceEndpoint section of the DID doc specifies service endpoints and provides URIs to the decentralized web nodes.\n\nGiven an application has the address to your DWN, they can send you a request for data.\n\nThis represents a request from an application to obtain all objects within a DWN that follow the SocialMediaPosting schema:\n\nThe data within DWNs are JSON objects that follow a universal standard, thus making it possible for any application to discover and process the data given its semantic type.\n\nIf this data is public, those objects will be automatically returned to the application, and if the data is private, the node owner would need to grant the application access to that data.\n\nObviously all of this is pretty complicated, especially for non-technical users. So we need a simplistic, easy to use interface that will allow people to access and manage their identity.\n\nA well designed identity wallet would provide ways to manage the data stored in decentralized web nodes, the decentralized IDs and the context in which they should be used, verifiable credentials, and authorizations.\n\nWeb 5 enables developers to build decentralized web applications (DWAs) on top of it and it’s all open source! You're free to use it as your foundation and focus your attention on what you really care about, your app. Web5 brings to DWAs what cloud and application servers bring to enterprise apps. It does the hard part. It brings decentralization. By building your apps on top of Web 5, you get decentralization and identity and data management as part of the platform.\n\nThis is definitely a fundamental change in how we exchange data, but it's not a total overhaul of the web we already know. This works like Progressive Web Apps, but you'd add the decentralized web node SDK and then applications are free to really go serverless because the data isn't stored with them.\n\nThe sky's the limit to what you can build on top of this platform, but here are some cool basic examples.\n\nNo one likes recreating their music playlists over and over again for different apps. With Web 5, you wouldn't have to do that.\n\nIn this example, Groove has access to write to Alice's decentralized web node and adds a new entry.\n\nTidal has access to read from Alice's DWN, so can read the new entry that was added by Groove, and now Alice has her playlist readily available on both apps.\n\nWith the continuous utilization of the data across apps, not only do Groove and Tidal get access to Alice's data, but they use it to improve her user experience, thus creating a stronger experience than Alice could have ever gotten had she not used this tech.\n\nYour travel preferences, tickets, and reservations are scattered across so many different hotels, airlines, rental car agencies and travel apps, making it really difficult to coordinate. Heaven forbid there's any hiccup in the system such as a delayed flight. You end up trying to get in touch with the car rental place to let them know you'll be late for your reservation, and if it's really late, you'd want to call the hotel to ask them not to give away your room. All while you're hustling and bustling at the airport.\n\nWeb 5 can help unify these various app experiences.\n\nIf Alice gives the hotel, the airline, and the rental car agency access to the Reservation and Trip objects in her DWN, they can react and adjust accordingly to any changes made.\n\nThese are just a few applications that can be realized by building on top of Web 5. There's so many more possibilities once the web is truly decentralized the way it was always intended to be.\n\nWhile we’re super excited about this technology, there's still lots of problems to be solved. We welcome you to join us in making the web we all deserve.\n\nCheck out our GitHub projects, if you’d like to see more or contribute to the components.\n\nWe have open job reqs if you’re interested in formally working on decentralized technologies.\n\nIf you're a company who is trying to solve these same challenges or could make use of any of these components, we'd love to collaborate.\n\nIf you’d like to join the community, we’re on Discord.",

      "# [Overview of tbDEX](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/tbdex/)\ntbDEX is an open source liquidity and trust protocol that unlocks frictionless commerce and financial access globally.\n\nThe protocol enables participants to securely validate counterparty identity and trust, as well as desired compliance with relevant laws and regulations.\n\nAfter trust establishment, tbDEX’s standard messaging protocol enables Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) and counterparties to discover, negotiate, and confirm transactions.\n\nOnce transaction details are confirmed, participants execute and settle these transactions outside of the protocol with PFIs directly.\n\ntbDEX is architected on Web5 infrastructure, utilizing decentralized technologies such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).\n\nThe web connected us all, but money and payments have not kept pace. The legacy payment system is held together with proverbial duct tape, concealing fundamental problems. Final settlement of payments is slow, expensive, and never quite final. These inefficiencies result in costly account fees or outright exclusion from the system, disproportionately affecting the economically disadvantaged.\n\nDecentralized and trustless systems eliminate barriers to seamless online financial services such as international money movement. Yet, legacy fiat systems are projected to stay integral to our financial systems for the foreseeable future. This is why our global financial system and the customers it serves needs a smooth method to transition between fiat and digital currencies.\n\nPut simply, tbDEX is a messaging protocol that allows for the decentralized transfer of value. This simplicity provides the opportunity to build whatever you want on top of it. tbDEX provides open and unbiased access to traditional financial services to enable everyone to participate in the world of digital currencies.\n\nThe vision for tbDEX is one where any member of our financial system can utilize the protocol to allow for portability and interoperability across currencies, nationalities, and, most importantly, people.\n\nFurthermore, tbDEX is designed to encourage competition among financial institutions for customers' business, offering them a choice among multiple providers. This competitive landscape incentivizes PFIs to offer more reasonable transaction fees, as they vie to attract and retain users within the tbDEX ecosystem.\n\nThe integration into one protocol ensures that every wallet application has access to every participating financial institution, fostering a customer-centric environment where quality of service and cost-efficiency become key differentiators.\n\nThis is transformative for smaller companies where the challenge to integrate with all wallet applications is too high. With tbDEX, finanicial institutions can adopt the protocol once and enable thousands of wallets.\n\ntbDEX is a messaging service that provides a common protocol for establishing trust and accessing liquidity.\n\nNote that tbDEX is not an exchange, payment processor, bank, custody or self-custody wallet, or financial service provider of any kind. Instead, tbDEX is a protocol that enables efficient communication between two willing counterparties.\n\nThere are essentially three types of actors involved in a tbDEX network:\n\nWallet Applications: These hold identifiers and credentials, acting as an agent to facilitate exchanges on behalf of a person seeking liquidity\n\nPFIs: The entities offering liquidity services on a tbDEX network\n\nVC Issuers: Organizations that act as sources of verifiable credentials\n\nUsing the tbDEX protocol, PFIs and Wallet Applications can exchange messages to negotiate a proposed transaction.\n\nAs part of negotiating a proposed transaction, PFIs and Wallet Applications message each other using the following tbDEX message types:\n\nRequest for Quote (RFQ): a request for the PFI to provide a quote specifically for the user based on the transaction they are proposing, the payment methods provided, etc. The RFQ also includes the proof of required credentials.\n\nQuote: a formal offer from a PFI detailing exactly what the user will receive in exchange for a specific currency or asset, as per their RFQ. It also includes the total fees associated with the chosen payment methods, instructions for making the payment and receiving the funds, and an expiration time after which the terms of the quote are no longer guaranteed.\n\nOrder: an agreement to execute the proposed transaction. The parties may then settle their transaction outside of tbDEX.\n\nOrder Status: updates on execution of the order, sent by the PFI.\n\nClose: signifies that the transaction has reached a terminal state. It can be used if the PFI is unable to provide a guaranteed quote to the RFQ, if the customer is no longer interested in the quote, if the order has failed, or if the order has completed. No messages can be added to a transaction after a Close has been sent.\n\nAlice holds a digital wallet application that securely manages her identity, including her identifiers, credentials, and authorizations for external apps and entities. Alice wants to exchange 100 units of digital currency for USD. Because Alice is off-ramping from digital currency to fiat, a PFI will likely require verification of Alice’s identity in order to fulfill their regulatory and compliance obligations.\n\nAlice informs her wallet of her need to make the transaction.\n\nAlice's Wallet discovers PFIs that offer this currency pairing, compares their credential requirements with the VCs Alice holds, and if necessary, applies for any missing VCs.\n\nRelated Guides\n\nThe Credential Issuer (if applicable) issues the required VCs to Alice, which are stored in her wallet.\n\nRelated Guides\n\nAlice’s Wallet presents the offerings to Alice, allowing her to choose the one she’d like to transact with.\n\nRelated Guides\n\nAlice considers various factors such as the reputation of the PFIs as well as the transaction fees before choosing a PFI.\n\nAlice's Wallet creates a request for a quote (RFQ) with Alice's DID, the details of her request, and the required VC - which Alice has already obtained previously.\n\nRelated Guides\n\nThe PFI receives the RFQ, verifies the credentials, and responds with a quote.\n\nRelated Guides\n\nAlice's Wallet accepts the quote by placing the order.\n\nRelated Guides\n\nThe PFI sends order statuses to the Wallet to update Alice about the order.\n\nRelated Guides\n\nThe PFI fulfills the order then sends a close message to Alice’s Wallet.\n\nRelated Guides\n\nBy leveraging decentralized technologies, tbDEX:\n\nOffers a permissionless and inclusive platform that allows for the transfer of funds across different currency systems and borders\n\nPromotes competition among PFIs, ensuring more equitable transaction fees and services for users\n\nProvides tools to meet regulatory requirements, including identity verifications"

I don't know if they do this on all of their shows or just this one but it's really odd having certain scenes purposefully be at a very low resolution\n\n## Comment ID h2ynn5b with +215 score by [(Davidgoessplat, Reddit, 2021-06-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MythicQuest/comments/o7fy2e/mythic_quest_s02e09_tbd_discussion/h2ynn5b/) (in reply to ID o7fy2e):\nI loved it, but I can't help but think this has series finale vibes.

Eventually, DQD met its eventual downfall. \n\nHowever, Poppy and Ian deciding to leave MQ is a massive step in saving MQ from becoming another DQD. If they had changed more about the game, it wouldn’t be MQ anymore.  \n\nThis season has shown again and again how Poppy and Ian mirror Doc and Beans’ relationship, but in the end Poppy and Ian reigned it in and actually preserved their game. Spectacular writing, there’s so many more interesting parallels with DQD and the CW special. I’m really hoping for a season 3!!\n\n### Comment ID h30jstm with +20 score by [(nutmac, Reddit, 2021-06-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MythicQuest/comments/o7fy2e/mythic_quest_s02e09_tbd_discussion/h30jstm/) (in reply to ID h2zypc1):\nGood observation.

I fell in love with this show during season one and the only reason I kept an Apple TV subscription was because the second season was already announced by then.\n\nHonestly, despite many theories I’d like to entertain for future arcs, I’d just be happy with a renewal and seeing what this fantastic team comes up with next for the show!\n\n## Comment ID h2yno6p with +45 score by [(ClarkeVice, Reddit, 2021-06-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MythicQuest/comments/o7fy2e/mythic_quest_s02e09_tbd_discussion/h2yno6p/) (in reply to ID o7fy2e):\nI really can’t tell if that’s it.

She longed for Dana so much, and it has to be hard to leave when she got a life that she’s wanted. Going to Berkeley shows great initiative and ambition where she previously showed none. Maybe she becomes Poppy’s and Ian’s writer (possibly alongside CW). When she got into the Berkeley program she swore it wasn’t because of Dana. I believed her, and it looks like she genuinely wasn’t trying to follow Dana. \n\nGood grief, I’m talking about her like she’s a real person haha.\n\n\nEdit: oh, they’ll want Dana as a coder.

Its not uncommon for series like this to change tone through seasons. And since they showed a bit of cw's personal life, briefly talked about Ian's relationship with both his son and his father, and left the relationship between Brad and his brother sort of in the open, there could have a slight possibility that they will want to dive a bit more in to these topics and show us a bit more of the other characters.

But I think I've been looking at it through the wrong lens. While I've been assuming that he'll be a savior to reunite the two expansions, C.W's episodes showed a theme I didn't notice until now— moving on. \n\nThe Nebula Award \"winner\" has a lot of resentment for the tripod. He found his place and the validation he craved in MQ. But he hasn't moved on even when given the satisfaction he deserved. That's why I think the two episodes of C.W are vital to this season, it's to build up the fact that C.W is the \"wise old sage\" of MQ (similar to Bert Cooper in Mad Men) and that wouldn't be possible without those two episodes. He was always a gag before, but the two episodes put him in a new light. C.W had a hard time moving on, the Nebula Award is a reminder that he got recognition at the cost of his friends, the tripod. Him being the one to tell Ian and Poppy that it is now time to move on is such a huge pay-off to his seasonal arc. He was the one to notice when to stop and notice that there's more to Mythic Quest. \n\nI appreciate the making up by the end of Poppy and Ian. They're really at they're best when they're working together. Ian tends to overextend his creativity and Poppy pulls her out. But with Hera, the power dynamic will be different. Ian will now have to control Poppy. I'm interested in that. \n\nBut I feel like they've cornered themselves so Season 3 is a big challenge for them. They've essentially divided the show into three worlds, Dana & Rachel, Brad, David, and Jo, and CW, Poppy and Ian. I'm not sure how they'll reunite, but I know that they can do it. I'm thinking something in the lines of the new creative director will mess MQ up, forcing Ian to step up for his baby.\n\nFelt like a season finale, but I hope it is not.

A potential season three could really explore how these individuals grow on their own, and eventually bring them back together again with some new dynamics or insights.\n\n## Comment ID h2yqntm with +13 score by [(milkyginger, Reddit, 2021-06-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MythicQuest/comments/o7fy2e/mythic_quest_s02e09_tbd_discussion/h2yqntm/) (in reply to ID o7fy2e):\nI liked this show. It would be cool if it has one last season but if this is it I'm not mad about it. I don't like shows that drag on forever and this felt like it could've been the series finale.

This season felt way too off-balanced and rushed as a result of them having to rewrite everything after quarantine. The 2-episode C.W. arc was so strong, I feel like there is still so much potential to be tapped in that vein. Even though they wrote themselves into a corner, I believe it will get renewed for a third season and focus on the characters' separate journeys...and possibly the uphill battle/financial failure of Hera, forcing Ian and Poppy back to MQ headquarters. Just because they have a good idea (and an upbeat ending), doesn't necessarily guarantee they will succeed. (Alternatively, if it doesn't get renewed, it still makes for a good finale.)\n\nReally sad about this season being over so soon, but at least Ted Lasso S2 is coming soon. Can't help but feel like David though; so much to take in all at once.\n\n### Comment ID h32s7jd with +4 score by [(zachpledger, Reddit, 2021-06-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MythicQuest/comments/o7fy2e/mythic_quest_s02e09_tbd_discussion/h32s7jd/) (in reply to ID h2z9c97):\nnanananananananananana\n\nDANI ROJAS ROJAS!!\n\n## Comment ID h32eygb with +9 score by [(None, Reddit, 2021-06-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MythicQuest/comments/o7fy2e/mythic_quest_s02e09_tbd_discussion/h32eygb/) (in reply to ID o7fy2e):\n[deleted]\n\n### Comment ID h32sejz with +6 score by [(zachpledger, Reddit, 2021-06-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MythicQuest/comments/o7fy2e/mythic_quest_s02e09_tbd_discussion/h32sejz/) (in reply to ID h32eygb):\nA complisult is part compliment, part insult.

Dana and Rachel might be wildcards as maybe Rachel will have to stay with MQ due to the deal made, but I could see Ian and Poppy trying to steal her away as she had a lot of Poppy vibes for them in this episode when she was explaining grumpy goat. Then maybe have Rachel as CW’s replacement in MQ as she does something big in her first semester and she comes back only to have Dana leave.

I really admire finales like this, which don't just go for a whole bunch of miserable cliffhangers or have everyone holding hands and happy - it feels more true to life this way, the characters naturally moving on, sad about what's ending but optimistic for what's to come\n\nthis was some beautiful stuff, I would almost be okay with this being *the* series finale, but I also want this show back because it's fucking great, and there's a few hanging questions marks that make me want to see what's next. like: what's the deal with Zack? I guess Jo's off the hook now, but someone at MQ still got arrested for insider trading *plus* their two creative directors left, so if anything it would be even easier for Zack to swoop in and buy all the shares now. another nitpick: what about CW? we learned so much about him this season, and the way his journey played into him helping Poppy and Ian on theirs was beautifully done, but then he just disappeared. does he stay at MQ or go and live life with his new outlook? or follow Ian to his new project and they make a killer three-person team? last and most importantly of all, where the goddamn hell was Sue?!?\n\n### Comment ID h2zqcgg with +2 score by [(hso__, Reddit, 2021-06-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/MythicQuest/comments/o7fy2e/mythic_quest_s02e09_tbd_discussion/h2zqcgg/) (in reply to ID h2zkwli):\nThis could be interesting... have Zack sweep in and take over MQ and maybe eventually kill it.

There were a few character changes that felt jarring, but Poppy's was the most so. Her character hasn't ever gotten along the best with others, but in S2 she jumped back and forth between personalities (her w/ her team vs her w/ Ian) so often it was exhausting. And it seemed to be for nothing anyhow. They didn't really have her face consequences for those actions, such as a dev team walkout or reduced work quality or something.\n\nIdk. I still like the show overall and think Poppy isn't a bad person, but a bad boss yes.

We know (or: can reasonably assume based on how long it took them and how many revisions of 1.35 there were) they had to do major fuckery with the Android 10 Update, so there's either future code of JP in the current old codebase on NA or there's NA-only code there that might not play well with regular updates.\n\nNow, judging code from outside of actual production is always a difficult task, so take all this with a grain of salt or three. But mixing 2 year old code (pre-engine update code that runs what JP ran 2 years ago), adapting it to more modern standards to make it work for newer mobile devices and operating systems and then integrating old updates is... no small task, no matter which way I look at it.\n\nThe reality is that developing for mobile devices is a pain in the ass for *any* developer on *any* platform, regardless of what kind of application they're working on. Having to deal with years-old unity versions doesn't make it easier, but harder on top of that.\n\nI mean, maybe I'm overreaching here. Again, judging code from outside *is* always a bit of a luckshot. We'll see in future maintenances. For the moment, it's more apologems for us, so that's something, right?\n\n### Comment ID f7aysvd with +17 score by [(phoenix7240, Reddit, 2019-11-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/dv6xim/extended_maintenance_until_tbd/f7aysvd/) (in reply to ID f7ayjdl):\nnow while in any other long maitenence situation i would say your probably right (we all know how spegetti this code is) this is simply one of those times where either google or apple just doesnt have their app update live.

Good to know. Maybe the situation is less problematic than it seems to me.\n\nI also was mostly speaking due to them having extended standard maintenance hours from 3 to 4 with the last 2 updates as well, however.

It will do so with verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers to enable trusted, compliant transactions.\n\nDecentralized identity aims to provide a foundational technology that allows platforms, wallet providers, identity vendors, governments and authoritative issuers to create secure digital identities that can be used across various digital use cases, Brock told PYMNTS in an interview posted in November.\n\n“We never really thought about, what does it mean to identify a person on the internet in a way that is portable and doesn’t require you to rely on a single private platform,” Brock said.",

The case is being updated.\n\nThe driver of the go-kart was a 15-year-old boy, who was declared dead by a doctor at the scene. Relatives have been notified.\n\nThe accident happened at 18:00 on the go-kart track in Andebu in Sandefjord. Two hours later, the police announced that the boy was declared dead.\n\nThe race was a large event with over 200 participants and was organized by the Norwegian Motor Club Andebu.\n\nThe race and all further driving were stopped when the accident occurred.\n\nThe police are working on tactical and technical investigation steps at the scene.\n\nThe mayor of Sandefjord, Bjørn Ole Gleditsch, says the crisis team is involved and that they have talked to Tønsberg about assistance if needed. – I think this is tragic, and I think about the closest relatives and everyone who was present. It is brutal to witness something like this, he says.\n\nThe Norwegian Motorsport Federation states in a statement that: – The accident victim sustained extensive internal injuries, and despite the strenuous efforts of the health personnel who were on the scene within seconds of the incident, life could not be saved. – This is a terribly heavy day for Norwegian Motorsport, says Secretary General Hallgeir Raknerud of the Norwegian Motorsport Federation in the same message.\n\nI think it’s maybe prudent to wait until a few more details to come out to necessarily judge cause.\n\nThe driver was according to the article 15, so on the “high” end of the youth age range for rib and cartilage development. That said, a kart overturning is never good.\n\nI don’t know if any governing body tracks flips vs rate of injuries, but in my time in karting I’ve heard of 3 fatalities. I am sure there are more, but it is indeed quite rare.\n\nSo, let’s hopefully learn from this tragedy and see what can be improved…",

On Wednesday, it began offering access to TBD Health’s sexually transmitted infection/disease (STI/STD) testing kits on its site.\n\nSan Francisco-based Wisp is a virtual health provider for vaginal health, reproductive health and sexual health. Its direct-to-consumer platform offers birth control, as well as treatments for urinary tract infections, genital herpes, bacterial vaginosis and yeast infections. TBD Health, based in New York City, is an online and in-person sexual healthcare platform. It offers at-home STD testing and emergency contraception, as well as telemedicine consults. Its in-person clinics are located in Las Vegas and Denver.\n\nIn January, the companies announced that Wisp telehealth patients could be referred to TBD Health’s in-person clinics to receive STD testing, PrEP prescriptions, UTI treatments and other services. Through the expanded partnership, Wisp members can now order TBD Health’s STI/STD testing kits on Wisp’s website for free delivery. They take the test by providing a urine sample and return the kit to one of TBD Health’s partner labs. If the test is positive, then they will consult with a TBD clinician to receive treatment and understand the next steps.\n\n“We are on a continued mission to offer patients the treatments and care they need when they need it with no hassle, judgment, and no insurance required. … This partnership is helping us to further democratize access to sexual health care and marks the first time we are experimenting with at-home diagnostics on our platform,” said Monica Cepak, CEO of Wisp, in an email.\n\nWisp is paying TBD Health for its inventory, Cepak added.\n\nThe company’s announcement comes at a time when STI cases are on the rise. More than 2.5 million cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia were reported in the U.S. in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Syphilis cases rose by 80% in the U.S. between 2018 and 2022.\n\n“We recognize that there has never been a greater need for STI/STD treatments and testing options,” Cepak stated. “Through this partnership, we are meeting patient demand while simultaneously working to educate consumers on what symptoms look like and what preventative and post-diagnosis options are.”\n\nThe company also recently added two new medications to its site: M. Hominis Treatment and Ureaplasma Treatment. These bacteria don’t typically lead to issues, but can cause pain, discharge, vaginal odor and challenges with fertility if an imbalance occurs. The medications were created to “effectively combat the imbalance of different bacterias and quickly aid uncomfortable genital symptoms,” Cepak said.\n\nOther companies that offer sexual health support for consumers include Ro and Hims and Hers.",

Hello, everyone. I’m Sean Ferrell. I’m a writer. I write some sci fi, I write some stuff for kids, and I’m just generally curious about technology. And luckily for me, my brother is that Matt from Undecided with Matt Ferrell, which takes a look at those very topics, emerging technology and its impact on our lives.\n\nAnd together, Matt and I record this follow up to his show, where we discuss a little bit deeper and ask some questions that we find in the comments to dive deeper into the context of what Matt has been discussing. And Matt, how are you today on this, let’s say pleasant, late August morning?\n\nDoing pretty well.\n\nUh, got to admit though, I’m a little burned out, so I’ve been, uh, crunching on the channel, trying to get videos queued up and ready to go . Cause I’m going to be going, doing a lot of travel. I’m going to Vancouver for the everything electric show. Um, September 6th, to the 8th, I think it is. And by the way, if you want to go, uh, you can go buy tickets.\n\nI have a discount. I can put that in the description of the podcast, but, um, getting ready for that. And then I have another event the immediate week after that, I’m going to, um, and so this past week I realized, I need a break. So, uh, you may notice something on the Undecided channel. There’s no, there’s not going to be any kind of scheduled regular videos, probably the first two weeks of September, because the way everything aligned, it was like, I don’t know if I can do a quality video and keep pace of what I’m doing.\n\nSo my team and I were kind of taking a little bit of a breather and trying to get ahead, but so there’ll be a little gap.\n\nIt’s very, very easy to move one thing up thinking, well, if I move this one thing up, then it will benefit me later. And then you forget that you move that one thing up and you move a second thing and then you move a third.\n\nAnd then pretty soon you’re like, how come I’m doing twice as much work in this five day period as I would normally do. And it’s because, Oh, I moved a full week of other content up one week. I do that to myself all the time. It’s very easy to catch yourself in that burnout moment. So I’m glad for your sake that you recognized it before you went on your trip, because I usually recognize it after I do something big like that by just getting sick.\n\nI like find myself in a position of like, why am I running a fever? Oh, I burnt myself out.\n\nWell, it, it also came up cause it’s like, um, I’m also, there might be a trip where I might be going to Mexico. At the end of October, uh, to go visit a production plant. I can’t say who it is and what it’s for yet. Um, but if that works out, that’s another huge trip I’m doing.\n\nAnd then in the first week of January, I’m going to CES. So I was planning all this out and that’s when I just kind of had this epiphany of like, what, what, what am I doing? I’m not built for all this travel. This is too much. Uh, I need, I need a break.\n\nYeah. And I mean, it’s funny, as you describe all of that, you’re not built for all this travel.\n\nI think of you as a pretty big homebody.\n\nI do not think of you as the like, I can’t wait to go. I can’t wait to be there. I can’t wait to see new sites. I think of you as the like. I will perhaps go there next year.\n\nAs we always like to do on this program, we’d like to follow up on our previous one before we get into the new content from Matt’s channel. So this will be a brief visit to the mailbag from episode 232, Weird Solar Panel Technology. This was the algae solar panel discussion we had last time. And we talked a bit about\n\nthe weird science of this, we talked a bit about the fringe science of this. We talked about the research for research’s sake, because part of our discussion was nobody out there is saying like, darn it, we have to crack the algae barrier, we have to get algae into the solar panels, so it became a discussion of kind of like when researchers follow their nose and just\n\nwander into weird corners. And there was some conversation in the comments about that very thing. Like this from Jim Thane, who said, science for the sake of knowledge is a great thing. Someone really should be covering this stuff and making it sexy so that more people are encouraged to do science for the sake of knowledge.\n\nSo many useful things have come out of such science totally unintentionally, that we really ought to be heavily encouraging it, even if it only leads to a dead end. Thanks for discussing this weird and fascinating idea. And I really liked Jim’s kind of, you know, wrapping it all up in a, this is great. And you don’t know what by products might come out of this.\n\nAnd I was wondering from your perspective, uh, just based on the research that you’ve done, you’ve now been doing your channel for, for many years on a scale of, Like one to 10 or a percentage perhaps is an easier way to do it. What percentage of technology that you talk about has in some way origins that started from research for research’s sake?\n\nOh, man, uh, I wouldn’t be able to really put a number on that, but it’s a, it’s going to be a high number. That one of the things that, this isn’t exactly what you’re talking about, but it’s kind of like there was a number of years ago I talked about this, um, fusion company here in New England called Commonwealth Fusion Systems.\n\nThey have this design for a spark reactor, which is really tiny, um, where The ITER project over in Europe is this massive boondoggle of a fusion thing that they’re building. They’ve been building it for 30 years and it’s still falling behind and it’s just a waste of money and it’s this huge kind of mess at the moment.\n\nThe spark reactor is like that shrunk down to something really tiny and it’s like, well, Why are we still doing ITER if we have this little spark reactor that they’re building and they’re hoping in the next five years to have it up and running for testing? It’s like, uh, why is that possible when the big guy is having trouble?\n\nAnd well, the reason is because there were discoveries around like magnets and superconductors that This rib, this ribbon material breakthrough for this superconductor that is being used in the spark design. So it’s like the spark design wasn’t possible until somebody else discovered this thing over here on this left side over here.\n\nAnd it’s like, well, what’s the practical use of that thing? Oh, well, Hey, look, you know, here’s the spark reactor over here. That’s like, Hey, we can use that. It’s like that kind of stuff happens all the time. And so it’s like, I think Jim, the way he said it. was perfect. It’s like, it’s like exploring this stuff, even if it hits a dead end, at some point down the road, it may unlock something for a completely different person, a different group to make their thing possible.\n\nIt’s like, you don’t know what you don’t know. So we have to kind of just kind of throw everything at the wall and see what sticks. Um, but the accident, like the accidental discovery, like you’re talking about like the, like the, like NASA stuff, like what, wasn’t it silly putty? Well, yeah, that was an accident, yeah, stuff like that.\n\nBut also just, just in the sense of, like, you often on your channel share, and one of the things we’re going to be talking about in today’s episode is a follow up to your most recent video, which talks about battery technology and the battery technology isn’t new. It’s been expanded upon and utilized in a new way to make it more efficient and trying to lower costs.\n\nBut the technology itself would have started decades ago and I couldn’t help but wonder how much of that research decades ago started as research for research’s sake that kind of hit a dead end because they were like, well, there’s nothing we can really do with this right now. And I know you’ve mentioned that in other videos, so I’m not trying to pin you down to answer the question, but I just think it’s an interesting thing to ruminate on and think in terms of, like Jim said, it’s, You never know what byproduct might come out of this thing.\n\nAnd to say, we need to have a direct application. I don’t even know how we would make progress into new fields if everything was related to a direct application. We’re seeing that happen constantly right now. I can’t help but think of AI. AI is being developed as a thing in and of itself without it being like, Oh, we’re answering this request.\n\nYeah. It touches on. Oh, I could go down a rabbit hole in that. We won’t, we won’t dive into that one this week. We’ll save that for another time. A couple more comments I wanted to share. These were followups on our conversation about Matt’s dog, uh, enjoying tearing my books apart. And as Aromatic Snail points out, if anything, Matt’s dog is confirming that Sean’s books are food for thought.\n\nThere we go. And finally, to wrap up the weird science of it all, Ryu jumps into the comments to say weird science episodes. Yes, please. But I now have that song stuck in my head. You’re welcome. It is it is an earworm. On now to this week’s episode of Undecided and it was Matt’s Recent episode, which dropped on August 8th, 2024, how this new battery is changing the game.\n\nAnd it, as we just briefly mentioned, this is not brand, brand new tech. It is a new way of utilizing older technologies and creating a, ultimately Matt, am I right in saying that the goal here is to lower the cost and increase the longevity as the two, the one, two punch for this. Yeah.\n\nIt’s increasing the longevity, which helps to reduce the cost.\n\nCause you have to change your batteries less frequently. You get more bang for your buck out of a battery like this. It’s kind of like, um, there’s a recipe that we have for something and it’s somebody figured out how to tweak one part of the recipe just to make it even better than it was before. It’s like, that’s essentially what’s happening with this battery.\n\nAre you surprised by anything about this? In the form of the speed with which the development of battery technology is happening recently. We’ve talked about batteries. It feels like we talk about batteries once a month. Roughly, it feels like, it feels like it’s, it’s the ever returning content of your channel.\n\nSo it’s the ever returning content of this channel and it’s different forms. Oh, there’s a salt battery. Oh, there’s a effectively a rust battery, a heat battery, a sand battery, like all the different permutations of these different things. And I’m wondering, is there. And I use this term without even intending to get to the pun of it is the research in this in the field here energized by the massive need that you point out in your video of people are using more and more power and we have the ability to generate more and more power in more sustainable ways.\n\nEven if you don’t take one coal plant or one gas burning plant offline, if all you do is add solar panels and wind turbines to energy generation, your energy levels go up, but you need to store that technology, that energy because you can’t rely on, well, the solar panel is feeding my television right now.\n\nThat’s not the way it would work. So is that what’s driving all these wild field researches into different new technologies around battery storage? Okay. I\n\nhave to break this down a couple of different ways. Yes. It’s like, if you look at I was, uh, recently looking at some research and some graphs and papers on how batteries have evolved over the past 30 years.\n\nAnd Like, prices of batteries have dropped almost 100%. I think it’s like 97 percent in the past 30 years from what they cost. It was like 6, 000 a kilowatt hour or something crazy. And now it’s like a hundred and something dollars per kilowatt hour. It’s like the drop in 30 years is crazy. And then that graph, If you invert it, it’s kind of like that’s the amount of money being spent on R& D in batteries.\n\nThe amount of money has been poured into this is just skyrocketing. It looks almost like an exponential graph. Then if you look at the use of batteries, how many batteries we need and we use, Same thing. It’s like 1990s, this like little blip. And then like, as you get to the 2000s, it gets higher because people are using laptops and phones and all those kinds of things.\n\nAnd then EVs, and then suddenly it just skyrockets. And it’s not that it’s just utility energy storage. It’s EVs, utility energy storage, iPhones, laptops, mobile phones, all these batteries just permeate everything in our world today, which is why it’s just like an exponential growth. And so all these things kind of go hand in hand.\n\nMore demand for energy storage has caused more investment into it, which has made more advances in it, which has reduced the cost of manufacturing it because they got better and better at it. So all these things kind of play together. And one thing I noticed in the comments of this most recent video is there’s this undercurrent of a thread of just enough with the batteries.\n\nI’m sick of this. Another game changing battery. I’m sick of this. To those people, my reaction is it doesn’t have to be a battery that’s available for you to buy today to talk about it because there is so much happening in battery research In this space, we got to talk about it because we have to understand where is this stuff heading?\n\nLike, I’m curious to see where this is going to be five years now, 10 years from now, to be able to understand that I have to look at the entire battery industry and see what’s happening and talk about those different things. And so it’s when I say this is a game changing the game, it’s changing the game because it’s taking a battery we’ve known and making it a longer lifespan, which means it’s going to last longer and be cheaper to make these installations.\n\nIt’s going to have a major impact on the industry over the next few years because it’s coming out like now. So it’s like, I find that perception Impr uh, Viewpoint on how many battery videos I’m making interesting, cuz like I don’t share that sentiment obviously cuz I talk about it a lot. But at the same time, I have hit a glut on my channel over the past like two months.\n\nThere’s been a lot of battery videos, and I’m gonna be dialing that back because I do have to find a better blend of topics, or the cuz it’s just like I’m kind of batteryed out myself a little bit, because I’m talking about it for so much so frequently recently, but at the same time, it’s we can’t ignore it.\n\nIt’s like this is happening because there’s so much investment into batteries today, and there’s so much advancement happening. So, you’re literally talking about changing up the batteries. Yes. Exactly. The other thing I find funny is that there are people saying like, this is being talked about all the time and the batteries we’re using today are the same they’ve been used for 30 years.\n\nNo, they’re not. The batteries in our mobile phones today are not the exact same batteries that were being used 20 years ago. They are not. They are, they are modern versions of batteries are better than the batteries they were 10 years ago. So it’s like, or five years ago, it’s like, you just don’t recognize it because it’s like hidden inside the devices we use and we’re not aware of it.\n\nBut these advances are ending up in the devices we’re using every day around us. It’s like, come on.\n\nYeah.\n\nJust those kinds of statements. I don’t understand.\n\nIt yeah it, it raises, there’s the aspect of, um, given the opportunity to learn information isn’t a requirement to learn that information. So there’s always the next channel.\n\nIf like, Oh, I’m batteried out. Come back next week. Matt will have a different topic, but, uh, there was also like, as you, as you pointed out, these are not all interchangeable. These are not all apples, even though they’re all batteries. They are, have different aspects to them. And there was a comment that I wanted to share from Hassan who jumped in to say, I’m a BESS engineer working with all of these systems mentioned in the video and many more.\n\nI’m under NDA for all of these. So I can’t say anything that’s not public, but all I can say is there is a lot coming and we are just at the start. I think that is. Exactly. That’s a really intriguing perspective for somebody to say, yeah, we’re not done. And I mean, some of the angles that you can take on this are really funny.\n\nThere’s inadvertent humor that comes out of it. Like I recently saw somebody pointed out. That they had purchased a, a set of wired earphones for their Mm-Hmm iPhone. And on the box it says, requires Bluetooth connection. Yes. So I saw the expression in your face, you’re like, Hmm. And it was, yeah. Like what?\n\nLike the guy’s, like, I got these from Amazon. What is going on here? And somebody in the comments pointed out they were probably super, super cheap. Yes. That’s because companies have discovered ways of making super, super cheap Bluetooth headphones. And it’s cheaper to not have a battery and to use the iPhone as the power.\n\nSo they have a wired connection. Only for power, but they are Bluetooth earphones. And I’m like, we’ve reached a level of absurdity with our technologies where is it a battery? It is it a new battery? Is it technology that’s old? Is it changing anything? We no longer have the ability to identify that easily.\n\nAnd your channel might be a way for people to learn how to tell Oh, yeah, the needle has moved a bit. This is not what we had 10 years ago. This is a little different. This is not doing exactly what the other one is doing. And to get back to the content of this particular battery pack, there were comments about the five year warranty, the five year plan of there being no degradation.\n\nI say the word warranty because that was one of the comments that kept coming up is. What does a system that’s saying it will last five years without degradation actually doing? And there was some speculation that what it might be doing is there might be something in the system that is using power cells in the batteries on a selected basis.\n\nSo that not every cell is being used all the time and it may be sharing the work over a period of time so that they avoid the normal degradation to get to that five year window. I don’t know if that even matters. Big picture. If you create a system that is using older tech in a new way that creates a five year promise of no degradation, I don’t know that it matters that it’s not doing something magical and new under the hood, if it’s still achieving that five year window.\n\nMy question though. Is, do you know anything about what the company is promising as far as a warranty, as far as here’s this tech and it’s going to have no degradation for five years? Do you know anything about what the companies are doing to stand behind that promise? From CATL, the specific battery\n\nthat we’re talking\n\nabout?\n\nNo. Because this is like utility grid scale. You’re buying a gigawatt hour of storage in a container. They don’t have on their website or their materials. And we offer a 30 year money back warranty on this. It’s not like a consumer product. It’s something very different. There’d be different warranties, different guarantees, and I could find nothing about it.\n\nThe big marketing that they’re putting out about it was this new SEI layer system that they’ve come up with when you first charge the battery improves the battery life span. So that first five years, there’s no noticeable degradation in this use. It does degrade over time, but that first five years, it’s like, if you think about like a graph, it looks like a prior S curve where it’s like almost flat and then it slowly starts to go down.\n\nUm, That’s what it looks like for the degradation. That’s why they’re saying it’s five years. I don’t think it’s a better battery energy management system. Like the commenters are saying that’s playing some kind of trick to make it work. I don’t think that’s the case, but of course, I don’t know. Maybe, maybe it’s part of that.\n\nBut again, at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter. If they’re selling you a gigawatt hour battery and it’s got a gigawatt hour and it doesn’t have any signs of degradation for five years, it’s like, you got what you paid for. It does what it says on the tin. That’s the thing that I think is interesting.\n\nIt’s a little bit like if you bought a car and you were told, like, it uses gasoline, but it gets A hundred miles to the gallon. You could say, well, I don’t want it because it’s still gas, but you shouldn’t be upset that it’s not somehow magically not gas. It’s the, the ultimate goal of improvement is what’s being offered.\n\nNot necessarily a super secret sauce that nobody’s heard of before.\n\nThis ties back to the very first comment that you were talking about. It’s going to seem like I took a hard right turn here. Electric toothbrushes. The reason this popped in my head was I used to have a Sonicare electric toothbrush for like a decade.\n\nI think it was great. And it needed to be charged about every two weeks and perfectly happy with it, but it was getting kind of, it was kind of starting to break down. So I had to replace it. I bought this different brand of toothbrush. I think it was called the LifeN, some Chinese toothbrush thing, half the cost.\n\nIt’s super tiny, like more compact. And I don’t know what voodoo magic they’re doing inside this thing, but the battery life is somewhere over 30 days before it has to be charged. I’ve had this thing for a month and have not charged it yet. And it’s like, okay, I don’t understand this. Are they using some kind of wizard battery in here that just lasts forever?\n\nOr is the motor in here way more efficient than the motor that was in the Sonicare? It’s like, there’s probably like a little from column A, column B, column C, like all these like little things that are probably a little bit better that make the lifespan of the battery, the toothbrush, the product last longer.\n\nAt the end of the day, I don’t care. This battery has not been charged yet. That’s been a month. It’s, there’s probably some kind of wizardry, wizardry going on with the CATL battery that goes beyond just that system that came up with the SEI layer, that new system. There’s probably more to it than that.\n\nBut at the end of the day, what’s the product\n\nactually do? Two final comments that I wanted to point out to conclude our conversation on this one, this one first from Dan Harold, who went directly to the point of the newness of a tech and the lack of the tech being on the market. A complaint that we see in your videos off and on, depending on what you’re talking about.\n\nPeople complaining, Oh, if this is so great, why isn’t it available yet? And Dan points out people are complaining that battery cell tech never makes it to market. It can take years to get from the lab to commercial penetration. 1996, John Goodenough, and his team at the University of Texas at Austin discovered the LFP cathode material. Patent was granted in 1999.\n\nThe global LFP share increased to 34% in 2022. November, 2023 LFP batteries captured 31% of the passenger EV market. The forecast is to reach 39% by 2024. In China, LFP batteries now make up over 50 percent of the EV battery market with gigawatts term. Interest in battery cells has increased somewhat and perhaps will accelerate the required time.\n\nThis is A marathon. This is not a dash. Yes.\n\nYes. Dan, you said it perfectly. Thank you for saying that. That’s a really great way to kind of frame\n\nit. And finally, wanted to give you an opportunity. Was this a correction that is in fact a correction or is there a confusion on either your part, the scripts part or our commenters part? Little Wolf jumps in to say that at three minutes and 44, you mentioned that the energy market has tripled and Little Wolf points out the energy storage market almost tripled, not the energy market.\n\nIs that just a typo in the script that made it through?\n\nYes. And I got to apologize. There were a few typos in the script on this one. Um, this was not the only mistake. There was one that was in there that I completely missed. And one of the very first comments that came on the video when it launched. I was like, uh oh, and thank you for the YouTube editor tool.\n\nI just went in there and snipped the mistake out and took it out. Uh, I don’t know how these little errors got through, but it’s like, it is a little, it seems insignificant on the surface, but it has a distinct difference in meaning. So yes, that is the correct energy\n\nstorage market. So listeners, viewers, what do you think about all of this?\n\nJump into the comments and please let us know what you think.
