      "# [Home](https://tbd.website/)\nGlobally, 1.7 billion adults lack access to the banking system, yet two-thirds of them own a mobile phone that could help them access financial services. The internet and wireless technology has given us the information infrastructure we need to serve everybody, but money and payments have not kept pace.\n\nOur mission is to catalyze a community of developers, enterprises and entrepreneurs to build an open financial system, based on open source protocols and common standards, that can facilitate the movement of value anywhere around the world in an efficient, inclusive and trusted way.\n\nTBD is focused on building open protocols, open standards and open development communities to create an ecosystem of tools that all participants in the economy can benefit from: individuals, businesses, institutions and yes, even governments.\n\nThe power of open source is that TBD collaborates with developers from all over the world, and with other businesses and institutions who share our vision for a more open financial system.\n\nThe most important information we need to own is information about ourselves. Today, our identities and log-ins are controlled by increasingly centralized entities.\n\nBefore we can build a new system in which people are in control of their digital and financial lives, we need to start with fixing identity.\n\nThe great power of the internet has been the democratization of information. With decentralized identity, TBD is reinventing the account model of the internet â to empower people to own their identities, unlock access to financial services, and regain privacy and control over how their personal data is used.\n\ntbDEX is an open protocol that can facilitate the transfer of value anywhere around the world â whether to relatives in other countries, employees in other jurisdictions, or suppliers around the world.\n\ntbDEX creates a bridge, based on open standards, that connects the world of legacy currencies to digital currencies, without the need for centralized intermediaries or governance tokens. True to open source practices, tbDEX is a protocol that is available to everyone, but owned by no one.",

You retain all rights in your Content, subject to the rights you granted to us in these TBD Terms.\n\nYou will not upload or provide Content or otherwise post, transmit, distribute, or disseminate through the Services any material that: (a) is false, misleading, unlawful, obscene, indecent, lewd, pornographic, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, hateful, abusive, or inflammatory; (b) encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense or gives rise to civil liability; (c) breaches or infringes any duty toward or rights of any person or entity, including rights of publicity, privacy or Intellectual Property Rights; (d) contains corrupted data or any other harmful, disruptive, or destructive files; (e) advertises products or services competitive with TBDâs or its partnersâ products and services, as determined by us in our sole discretion; or (f) in our sole judgment, is objectionable, restricts or inhibits any person or entity from using or enjoying any portion of the Services, or which may expose TBD, its affiliates or its customers or other persons to harm or liability of any nature.\n\nAlthough we have no obligation to monitor any Content, we have absolute discretion to remove Content at any time and for any reason without notice. TBD may also monitor such Content to detect and prevent fraudulent activity or violations of TBD Terms. You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, or objectionable. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any Content, including any loss or damage to any of your Content.\n\nGeneral. You and TBD agree that any and all Disputes, except those that are resolved informally or brought in a small claims court, will be arbitrated by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same individual damages and individual relief that a court can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TBD TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST TBD. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration).\n\nPre-Filing Requirement to Attempt to Resolve Disputes. Before an arbitration is commenced, you or TBD agree to attempt to avoid the costs of formal dispute resolution by giving each other a full and fair opportunity to address and resolve a Dispute informally. Both parties recognize that this is an important requirement, and that breach of this requirement would be a material breach of the Terms. To provide this opportunity, before commencing any arbitration or suit, each party agrees to send to the other party a written Notice (âNoticeâ). Any Notice to TBD should be sent by mail to Block, Inc., Attn: TBD Arbitration Provision, PO Box 427069, San Francisco, CA 94142. Any Notice sent to you will be sent to the address on file for your account. The Notice must: (i) include your name and account number; (ii) provide detailed information sufficient to evaluate the merits of the claiming partyâs individualized claim and for the other party to determine if an amicable resolution is possible; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought, including whatever amount of money is demanded and the means by which the demanding party calculated the claimed damages. Both parties agree that they will attempt to resolve a dispute through an informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice is sent. After that sixty (60) day period and not before, either party may commence arbitration. Each party agrees that state courts in the City and County of San Francisco, California, or federal court for the Northern District of California, referenced below, may enter injunctive relief to enforce the pre-filing requirements of this paragraph, including an injunction to stay an arbitration that has been commenced in violation of this paragraph.\n\nScope of Arbitration. If we are not able to resolve the Dispute by informal negotiation or, as provided below, in a small claims court, all Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator (the âArbitratorâ) administered by the American Arbitration Association (https://www.adr.org ) according to this Section and theÂ Commercial Arbitration Rules Â for that forum, except you and TBD will have the right to file early or summary dispositive motions and to request that the AAAâs Expedited Procedures apply regardless of the claim amount. Except as set forth above, the Arbitrator shall be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the TBD Terms and/or Additional Terms (or any aspect thereof) are enforceable, unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.\n\nSmall Claims Court. Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, either party may elect to pursue a Dispute in a local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as the matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual basis. If a party has already submitted an arbitration demand to the AAA, the other party may, in its sole discretion, inform the AAA that it chooses to have the Dispute heard in small claims court. At that time, the AAA will close the arbitration and the Dispute will be heard in the appropriate small claims court, with no fees due from the arbitration respondent.\n\nArbitration Procedures. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1-16, including its procedural provisions, fully applies. Any arbitration hearing will occur in San Francisco, California, at another mutually agreeable location or, if both parties agree, by telephone or videoconference. The Arbitratorâs award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. TBD values your privacy, particularly with respect to your financial transactions and data. Each of the parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration and shall not (without the prior written consent of the other party) disclose to any third party the fact, existence, content, award, or other result of the arbitration, except as may be necessary to enforce, enter, or challenge such award in a court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise required by applicable law. While an arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief, the Arbitrator may do so only with respect to the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual partyâs claim. The Arbitratorâs decision and judgment thereon will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect.\n\nArbitration Fees. In accordance with the AAA Rules, the party initiating the arbitration (either you or us) is responsible for paying the applicable filing fee. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and TBD also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the Services.\n\nOpt Out. You may reject this provision, in which case only a court may be used to resolve any Dispute. To reject this provision, you must send us an opt-out notice (the âOpt Outâ) within thirty (30) days after you create a TBD account or we first provide you with the right to reject this provision.\n\nThe Opt Out must be mailed to Block, Inc., Attn: TBD Arbitration Provision, PO Box 427069, San Francisco, CA 94142.

      "# [Quickstart](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/quickstart/)\nWeb5 in 5️⃣ minutes\n\nLet's build a decentralized application on the Web5 platform - in under 5 minutes. You will learn how to:\n\n✅ Create unique digital IDs for users known as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)\n\n✅ Issue and manage digital proofs using Verifiable Credentials(VCs)\n\n✅ Store and read data from your users' personal data store called a Decentralized Web Node (DWN)\n\nLet’s go! 🚀\n\nThis will be the home of your new Web5 app. Run the following commands in your CLI:\n\nUse NPM to initialize a package.json file:\n\nUse NPM to install Web5:\n\nThese steps will create a package.json in the root of your project. Open the newly created package.json and add module as a type:\n\nCreate an index.js file where you will write all of your application logic:\n\nFor Windows using PowerShell:\n\nAt the top of your index.js file, add these lines to import the Web5 package dependencies that you will use to build your application::\n\nAdditional import for Node 18\n\nimport{ webcrypto }from'node:crypto';\n\nif(!globalThis.crypto) globalThis.crypto= webcrypto;\n\nNow that you've installed the Web5 SDKs, you are ready to start building!\n\nIn Web5 apps, a user’s unique identifier - like an email address - is called a Decentralized Identifier (DID). We are building a decentralized app, so your users are using identifiers that aren't tied to a centralized authority.\n\nThe Web5 class is an isolated API object for doing all things Web5. The connect() function creates an instance of Web5 and also creates a decentralized identifier or obtains connection to an existing one.\n\nIn index.js below the import statement, create a new instance of Web5:\n\nThis Web5 instance is what you'll use to access the other objects of Web5 such as dwn. Within the connect function we’re using dht as the DID method. Learn more DID methods.\n\nTest your code\n\nWanna see the DID you just created?\n\nIn index.js, add the following line and save your file:\n\nconsole.log(aliceDid);\n\nThen from the terminal, run:\n\nnode index.js\n\nYou'll see the newly created DID.\n\nYour DID will appear here\n\nIn the previous step, you generated what is known as a (DID), which appears as an alphanumeric string. It's more specifically referred to as a DID URI.\n\nThis DID URI is part of a broader JSON object, known as a Bearer DID, which contains metadata such as cryptographic keys that prove ownership of the DID and rules governing its usage, management, or modification. With a Bearer DID, the owner can securely sign and verify data, ensuring authenticity and integrity.\n\nTo access your Bearer DID, add the following lines of code to your index.js:\n\nJavaScript\n\nKotlin\n\nSwift\n\nTest your code\n\nWanna see the Bearer DID?\n\nIn index.js, add the following line and save your file:\n\nconsole.log(aliceBearerDid);\n\nThen from the terminal, run:\n\nnode index.js\n\nYou'll see the Bearer DID.\n\nYour Bearer DID will appear here\n\nVerifiable Credentials (VCs) are digital proofs used to confirm specific facts about individuals, organizations, or entities. In this step, you'll enable your users to create a self-signed VC -- allowing them to issue a Verifiable Credential that makes claims about themselves. For this example, the credential will state that the user has completed the Web5 Quickstart Guide.\n\nIn your index.js, create your Verifiable Credential:\n\nJavaScript\n\nKotlin\n\nSwift\n\nTest your code\n\nWanna see the VC you just created?\n\nIn index.js, add the following line and save your file:\n\nconsole.log(vc);\n\nThen from the terminal, run:\n\nnode index.js\n\nYou'll see the newly created Verifiable Credential.\n\nEnter a name in the input field and click \"Run\" to create a Verifiable Credential.\n\nYour VC will appear here\n\nNow, your users can sign the VC with their Bearer DID to ensure its authenticity and integrity.\n\nTo allow users to sign a VC, add this line to your index.js:\n\nJavaScript\n\nKotlin\n\nSwift\n\nWhen an issuer signs a VC, it attests that they are truly the one who issued it. This cryptographic process also converts the VC into a JSON Web Token (JWT), making the credential tamper-evident and verifiable by others.\n\nTest your code\n\nWanna see the JWT version of your signed VC?\n\nIn index.js, add the following line and save your file:\n\nconsole.log(signedVc);\n\nThen from the terminal, run:\n\nnode index.js\n\nYou'll see the JWT-encoded version of your Verifiable Credential similar to the alphanumeric string below:\n\neyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImtpZCI6ImRpZDpkaHQ6cDNpeHo1MXp4azR1MW5uN29xcnhpaGJzc3o3amNnNXd4ZTVpeThwcGo4ZXVwOHF4OXB1eSMwIn0.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.6R8jx0Z3xhab7X-Y-sGPVnZ2NdFL746ILcjJbGvSfCixUY1DBsd86CVJfnXXAwbfRm5KQv0xMS5XH4h7gKkZDA\n\nYour JWT will appear here\n\nYour users can now store the JWT form of their VC in a DWN (Decentralized Web Node).\n\nA DWN is a personal data store - a platform for messages, pictures, videos, medical records, and just about any content a user may want to store.\n\nRead more about DWNs\n\nYour app should not store users' data in your centralized database. Instead, their data should be stored in their DWN. This is how the user retains ownership over their content. Through permissions, users can decide which apps can read, write, and delete content from their DWN.\n\nThe DWN exists in local storage. The DWN persists across browser sessions and can be synched across a user's devices.\n\nA user can host their DWN in multiple locations. The Web5 SDK is both browser and Node.js compliant, meaning you can use the same APIs on both client side and serverside.\n\nTo store a VC in a DWN, add the following lines of code to your index.js:\n\nJavaScript\n\nKotlin\n\nSwift\n\nTest your code\n\nLet's see what was just written to the DWN.\n\nIn index.js, add the following line and save your file:\n\nconsole.log('writeResult', record);\n\nThen from the terminal, run:\n\nnode index.js\n\nYou'll see the record that was written to the user's DWN. It will resemble:\n\nwriteResult _Record {}\n\nYour written result will appear here\n\nIf the user has given your app read permissions to their DWN, you can read their data by accessing it through the record property.\n\nTo read the JWT-encoded VC stored in your DWN, add the following to your index.js:\n\nJavaScript\n\nKotlin\n\nSwift\n\nTest your code\n\nTo see the record that was read from the DWN, add the following to index.js:\n\nconsole.log('readResult', readSignedVc);\n\nThen from the terminal, run:\n\nnode index.js\n\nYou'll see the JWT-encoded version of your Verifiable Credential similar to the alphanumeric string below:\n\neyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImtpZCI6ImRpZDpkaHQ6cDNpeHo1MXp4azR1MW5uN29xcnhpaGJzc3o3amNnNXd4ZTVpeThwcGo4ZXVwOHF4OXB1eSMwIn0.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.6R8jx0Z3xhab7X-Y-sGPVnZ2NdFL746ILcjJbGvSfCixUY1DBsd86CVJfnXXAwbfRm5KQv0xMS5XH4h7gKkZDA\n\nYour read result will appear here\n\nUpon receiving a Verifiable Credential (VC) as a JSON Web Token (JWT), applications can convert it back to JSON format using the VerifiableCredential.parseJwt() method.

      "# [Web Assembly with ChatGPT by Mic Neale on 2023-01-10](https://developer.tbd.website/blog/chatgpt-writingcode/)\nWeb Assembly is a popular format for running binary applications in web browsers (with wide support).\n\nThis can have a few advantages but the interesting thing for us is that this can allow sharing of implementations of functionality: credential issuance, DID resolving, cryptographic functions, etc which you may not want to necessarily re-implement in JavaScript or TypeScript.\n\nThe SSI-SDK is an implementation of a lot of standards for self-sovereign identity, so it is a great candidate to expose via WASM to web apps.\n\nNow there is a whole lot of (let's face it: tedious) machinery to get WASM to be compiled from Go (ok if you are really curious you can read the code), but the upshot of it is that there is a .wasm file produced which when consumed in just the right way in a web page, allows you to call functions from JavaScript, that look and feel like JavaScript, but are actually running in the web-assembly machiner (and compiled down from Golang).\n\nSay you had a function in Golang land which looked like this:\n\nYou could call it from the web via:\n\nand it would Just Work thanks to WASM! Well, thanks to WASM and a lot of boring glue.\n\nBut the boring glue is what I am here to talk about it, as it turns out ChatGPT can be quite helpful for the boring (but important) glue.\n\nSo firstly, there is some work to be done to build a shim between the JavaScript type world and the Golang type world:\n\nThis gets more complicated when you have more complicated types, but essentially this is the pattern you follow to expose functionality. Now I am a pretty ordinary Golang developer, so being lazy I thought I would see if I could teach ChatGPT about WASM and if it could write this glue code for me.\n\nHelpfully the SSI-SDK has a good amount of test coverage, so to teach ChatCPT about the API I was trying to expose, I pasted in a test case which exercised the API. The functionality was the \"Resolve\" function above, and the test code showed how to use it.\n\nI then asked ChatGPT to provide a WASM friendly wrapper for that functionality:\n\nTo do this, I gave it an example of some previously written code that uses some (unrelated) functionality and also exposes it to WASM. As you can see it was happy to provide an implementation which whilst close, with some minor tweaking.\n\nI was able to tidy it up and include it in the pull request. Handy - thanks ChatGPT! Moreover, as I am an ordinary Golang developer I was able to ask it to put in a retry on error (also some important glue) when using WASM from a web app (this staved a minor amount of googling):\n\nWASM seems surpremely useful, and ChatGPT, while terrifying on one level, looks like it can really take away some of the grind work from developers, allowing us to move much faster into more platforms. And no, this post was NOT written by ChatGPT, but by a human.",

      "# [Web5 App Wins did:hack Hackathon by Angie Jones on 2023-06-23](https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-hack/)\nThe Decentralized Identity Foundation organized did :hack, a decentralized identity hackathon designed for people to learn, collaborate, and think creatively about how decentralized identity technology can be leveraged to improve digital interactions in the future.\n\nThe 4-day virtual event included sessions from TBD, SpruceID, Dock.io, Aviary Tech, Trinsic, and Danube Tech - all providing educational sessions on ecosystem tools that enable decentralized identity and verifiable credentials.\n\nHackathon participants gathered in small teams to build projects centered around decentralized identity. There were some amazing ideas including:\n\ndid:loc, a privacy preserving location sharing DID method\n\na decentralized personal finance app using Web5\n\na mobile voting app that allows people to cast a vote from a mobile phone, and verifies a voter's eligibility with a verifiable credential that belongs to a DID\n\na browser extension to display and verify DID and Verifiable Presentation data for the currently viewed website\n\ndid-bsv, a DID method for verifiable ordinals\n\na decentralized housing platform using DIDs and VCs for reputation tracking\n\nFortunately, the presentations of the projects were recorded.\n\nD-PFin, a team comprised of Moises Jaramillo, Courtney Chan and Dixita Sharegar, used Web5 to create a decentralized personal finance app that stored financial data in a DWN and provides information to the user to make financial decisions.\n\nWe're delighted that the D-PFin team chose Web5 to build their decentralized app! It's a testament of the power of coupling decentralized personal data stores with decentralized identity. Be sure to watch the team's final presentation below.",

Immediately name your snippet after the :snippet-start: tag.\n\ntest('createDidDht creates a DID with did:dht method',async()=>{\n\nconst didDht =awaitDidDhtMethod.create({publish:true});\n\n});\n\nAfter creating your snippets, run the command pnpm run shnip. This will generate a folder called snippets and create a directory structure similar to where the file is.\n\nIn the generated folder you'll find the generated file named as functionName.snippet.js (or the respective file extension). For example, the above snippet will be createDidDht.snippet.js.\n\nTo use the snippet in your documentation(.mdx file), you're going to use the Shnip component. The Shnip component will dynamically import your snippets for you. Here's an example on how to use it:\n\n// if it's a multi language doc, you'll need to specify it with the LanguageSwitcher component\n\nJavaScript\n\nKotlin\n\nSwift\n\nThis is how you can add a generated code snippet and an inline hardcoded snippet into the doc:\n\n```js\n\n<Shnip\n\nsnippets={[{ name: 'assignVcJwt', language: 'JavaScript' }]}\n\ninlineSnippets={[\n\n{\n\ncode: `\n\nval signedVcJwt = \"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImtp...\"\n\n`,\n\nlanguage: 'Kotlin',\n\n},\n\n]}\n\n/>\n\nTo display inline code in a language different from the tab's primary language, use codeLanguage. If codeLanguage is unspecified, it defaults to language. Example: For Bash in a JavaScript tab, set language: 'JavaScript', codeLanguage: 'bash'\n\n<Shnip\n\ninlineSnippets={[\n\n{\n\ncode:`\n\nnpm install @web5/credentials\n\nnpm install @web5/dids\n\n`,\n\nlanguage:'JavaScript',\n\ncodeLanguage:'bash',\n\n},\n\n]}\n\n/>\n\nMDX and JSX struggle to parse line breaks. For controlled line breaks in inline snippets, use breakLineAt with line numbers in an array. Example: To break after lines 1 and 5, set breakLineAt: [1, 5]\n\n<Shnip\n\ninlineSnippets={[\n\n{\n\ncode:`\n\nimport { VerifiableCredential, PresentationExchange } from \"@web5/credentials\";\n\nclass SwiftiesFanClub {\n\nconstructor(level, legit) {\n\n// indicates the fan's dedication level\n\nthis.level = level;\n\n// indicates if the fan is a genuine Swiftie\n\nthis.legit = legit;\n\n}\n\n}\n\n`,\n\nbreakLineAt:[1,5],\n\n},\n\n]}\n\n/>\n\nTo add titles to code snippets, use the title prop. Example: title: 'Issuer.js' adds a title to the snippet.\n\n<Shnip\n\nsnippets={[{ name: 'assignVcJwt', language: 'JavaScript', title: 'Issuer.js' }]}\n\ninlineSnippets={[\n\n{\n\ncode: `\n\nimport { VerifiableCredential, PresentationExchange } from \"@web5/credentials\";\n\nclass SwiftiesFanClub {\n\nconstructor(level, legit) {\n\n// indicates the fan's dedication level\n\nthis.level = level;\n\n// indicates if the fan is a genuine Swiftie\n\nthis.legit = legit;\n\n}\n\n}\n\n`,\n\ntitle: 'Issuer.js',\n\n}\n\n]}\n\n/>\n\nTo enhance our documentation with executable code snippets that remain synchronized with the latest test cases, we've introduced prepend tags. These tags allow you to specify setup code, such as import statements, that should be automatically included at the beginning of designated snippets. This ensures that our documentation reflects accurate and executable code examples.\n\nmatch: Mimics the test file's directory structure.\n\nbyLanguage: Organizes snippets into language-specific directories.\n\norganized: A structure that organizes by language and function name. For example: /snippets/js/createDidDht and /snippets/kt/createDidDht\n\nflat: Places all snippets directly within the snippets folder.\n\nPrepend tags are used to mark blocks of code that should be prepended to one or more snippets. Here's how to use them:\n\nMarking Prepend Blocks: In your test files, use the :prepend-start: and :prepend-end: tags to denote the beginning and end of a code block that should be prepended. Immediately after the :prepend-start: tag, specify the names of the snippets that should include this block, separated by spaces.\n\nimport{SomeLibrary}from'some-library';\n\nAssociating with Snippets: Ensure that the snippet names provided after the :prepend-start: tag match exactly with the names used in your :snippet-start: tags. This association is case-sensitive and must be precise to ensure the correct prepend blocks are included.\n\nAfter marking your prepend blocks and associating them with snippets, run the pnpm shnip command. This process will automatically prepend the specified blocks to the snippets and generate the output in the configured snippets directory.\n\nimport{DidDhtMethod}from'@web5/dids';\n\nconst didDht =awaitDidDhtMethod.create({publish:true});\n\nThe generated snippet will include the import statement at the top, ensuring the snippet is executable and reflects the necessary setup:\n\nimport{DidDhtMethod}from'@web5/dids';\n\nconst didDht =awaitDidDhtMethod.create({publish:true});\n\nClear Command: pnpm shnip clear\n\nStructure Flag: pnpm shnip --structure byLanguage\n\nThe code snippet function names need to be unique, these names are what is used to generate/name the snippet files.\n\nThese tests are only testing the code snippets. There are more thorough tests that actually test the SDK.\n\nYou can use the following scripts to run the tests:\n\npnpm test to run tests\n\npnpm test:watch to run tests in dev mode\n\nWhen contributing to projects under TBD you agree to license your contributions under Apache License 2.0.\n\nJoin the Community\n\nConnect with us everywhere.\n\nGitHub\n\nSubmit a PR or open an issue\n\nView\n\nDiscord\n\nEngage with fellow community members\n\nJoin\n\nTwitter/X\n\nFollow us for news and updates\n\nFollow",
      "# [Blog on 2024-10-29](https://developer.tbd.website/blog/)\nWhenever I explore technology that's new to me, whether it be learning how decentralized apps work or what an open source tool does, it's seeing the technology in action that helps me understand whether or not it can impact me and my every day life. This is why every month at TBD, what better way to learn about our technology in action than from innovators using TBD's technologies today.\n\nHave you ever watched a creator’s video and thought, \"Where did she get that top?\" or \"I need that protein powder\"? You scroll through the comments, only to see the infamous \"link in my bio\" comment. You rush to click the link, and you're hit with-page not found 😒. I remember once being so desperate that I took a screenshot of the item and reverse-searched it on Google Images. I found something similar but not what I wanted. SO frustrating. Eventually, I gave up and kept on scrolling.\n\nAt the recent California DMV Hackathon, the Block team, represented by members from Square and TBD, won the Best Privacy & Security Design award for building a prototype of an instant age verification system. This solution utilizes mobile drivers’ licenses (mDLs) to provide secure, privacy-centric transactions for age-restricted purchases with Square’s Point of Sale (POS) system.\n\nIn this post, we’ll explore the core technical components behind our solution, which centered on using TruAge technology to enable seamless, secure age verification.\n\ntbDEX is an open messaging protocol that enables liquidity seekers to connect with liquidity providers. This means that as a liquidity provider, your business can be the backend supplier in several payment applications.\n\nPerforming KYC on repeat customers every time they attempt to transact with you from a different payment app would be a pain. To avoid this, you will use the Web5 SDK to issue a Known Customer Credential (KCC) to a customer, Alice, who you have already completed KYC on. You will store the JWT representing the KCC in Alice’s Decentralized Web Node so that she can present it to your business from any payment app.\n\nAt TBD, we are committed to building a decentralized future where users have greater control over their data and organizations can interact in a more open, trustworthy, and secure way. Open standards are the foundation of this vision, enabling the seamless collaboration and interoperability across systems.\n\nEverything we do at TBD is enabled and strengthened by open standards. Our most notable projects, Web5 and tbDEX, are deeply rooted in these open standards. The frameworks for decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs), and the protocols that facilitate their sharing form the backbone of our work.\n\n\"Verifiable Credentials seems niche. Only a small group of technologists would be interested in this,\" a conference attendee declared after I enthusiastically described my company's work in the Global Payments and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) ecosystem.\n\nThis comment gave me pause. Less than a year ago, I first encountered Verifiable Credentials (VCs) - a W3C standard for digital credentials that state specific facts about individuals, organizations, or entities. My initial reaction was similar to the conference attendee’s response. However, after interviewing SSI builders on a weekly livestream, my perspective changed dramatically.\n\nWhile VCs are relatively new and primarily explored by SSI enthusiasts, their benefits extend far beyond this group. Many of the services and products you use today already rely on them – even if you don't realize it.\n\nFrom healthcare to content creation, finance to travel, VCs are changing how we share and verify information. Here's a look at seven real-world applications of VCs that may surprise you:",

      "# [DID DHT: Ready For Primetime by Gabe Cohen on 2024-04-08](https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht/)\nDigital identity shapes every facet of our online interactions. The quest for a system that balances decentralization, scalability, security, and user experience has been relentless. Today, I'm thrilled to share that TBD has birthed a new solution: the DID DHT method. This leap forward is not just a technical achievement; it's a foundational component for the more inclusive and trust-based digital world we want for tomorrow.\n\nThe specification is nearing its first major version, and our team has produced client software in all of our open source SDKs in more than five languages. We have also built and deployed a publicly-available developer gateway, which has already registered many thousands of DIDs, with staging and production-ready gateways coming soon.\n\nSome of you may already be familiar with DID DHT and why we’ve chosen to make it our default DID method, but if not, or if you’re curious to find out more, read on to learn more about how the method was created, and how we’ve ended up here today.\n\nOur vision for a superior DID method hinged on several critical features:\n\nSufficient Decentralization — a foundational principle to mitigate censorship and enhance user autonomy.\n\nScalability and Accessibility – making digital identity accessible to billions, without a prohibitive cost barrier.\n\nComprehensive Feature Set — supporting multiple cryptographic key types, services, and other core DID properties.\n\nReliable and Verifiable History — enabling trust through transparency historical data.\n\nGlobal Discoverability – facilitating easy access and independent verification of digital identifiers.\n\nHistorically our software has supported did :key, did :web, and did :ion, and some other methods within certain segments of our stack. Recognizing the impracticality of a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach, we embraced a multi-method strategy. Today that strategy incorporates three key DID methods: did :jwk, did :web, and did :dht, each catering to specific scenarios with their unique strengths.\n\nWithin our SDKs, JWK replaces did :key , a simple and widely adopted method that uses standard JSON Web Keys (JWKs), limiting complexity over did :key ’s approach to using multi-formats. DID Web is an obvious choice for entities with existing brands, as trust can be easily linked to existing domains without the use of any special or complex technology. DID DHT is a new method that we view as a replacement for ION, which has strong decentralization characteristics, a robust feature set, and a simpler architecture.\n\nThe biggest change we’ve made is going from ION to DID DHT.\n\nION is a Sidetree-based DID method that is a L2 on the Bitcoin blockchain. ION is a fully-featured DID method, and one of the few that supports root key rotation and discoverability of all DIDs with complete historical state. However, there are three main reasons that led us to move away from using ION — architectural complexity, centralization risk, and a sub-optimal user experience.\n\nWhile ION presented a robust DID method with admirable features, its complexity, centralization risks, and user experience challenges prompted us to explore alternatives. DID DHT stands out as our choice for a new direction, offering simplicity, enhanced decentralization, and a user-friendly approach without compromising on the core features essential for a comprehensive DID method.\n\nDID DHT is built upon Pkarr, a community-created project. Pkarr stands for Public Key Addressable Resource Records and acts as a bridge between our DID method and the Mainline Decentralized Hash Table, overlaying DNS record semantics and providing a space-efficient encoding mechanism for DID Documents. The choice of Mainline DHT, with its over 20 million active nodes and a 15-year successful run, guarantees exceptional decentralization out of mainline nodes, but can also leverage Pkarr nodes and DID DHT gateways for additional functionality.\n\nDID DHT trades off use of a blockchain for immediate decentralization, fast publishing and resolution, and trustless verification. That’s right — the DID Document’s records are signed by its own key before entering the DHT — there’s no need to trust nodes, as you can verify payloads yourself client-side. Similar to ION, DID DHT documents support multiple keys, services, type indexing, and other DID Document properties.\n\nDID DHT, however, is not without its limitations. The main three being: a need to republish records to nodes regularly to prevent them from expiring from the DHT and reliance on a non-rotatable Ed25519 key called the “identity key,” as is required by the DHT and BEP44, and historical DID state not being shared between nodes. Our ongoing development and the community-driven enhancements aim to address these challenges, refining DID DHT's architecture for broader applicability and reliability.\n\nOne of the most interesting opportunities we have identified for DID DHT is interoperability with existing single-key methods like did :key and did :jwk. Essentially, you can continue to use single-key methods as you do today, with an optional resolution step to the DHT to extend the functionality of these methods, like adding additional keys or service(s) to a DID Document. We have begun to define this interoperability in the method’s registry.\n\nAnother interesting opportunity for DID DHT is with the W3C DID working group, which is currently going through a rechartering effort to focus on interoperability and DID Resolution. Depending on how the charter ends up, there could be an opportunity to promote the DID DHT method as one that is broadly interoperable, decentralized, and does not necessitate the use of a blockchain — a common critique of DIDs by community members in the past.\n\nWe have additional ideas such as associating human-readable names with DIDs, tying DIDs into trust and discoverability services, and supporting gossip between DID DHT gateways. We encourage you to join us on GitHub to continue the discussion.\n\nThe introduction of DID DHT represents a significant milestone in our journey toward a more decentralized, accessible, and secure digital identity landscape. We believe DID DHT has the characteristics to make it widely useful, and widely adopted. Try it out for yourself, and let us know what you think.\n\nAs we continue to refine and expand its capabilities, we invite the community to join us in this endeavor, contributing insights, feedback, and innovations to shepherd DID DHT toward becoming your default DID method.",
      "# [Beyond Blockchain: How Web5 Enables Fully Decentralized Apps by Chris Giglio on 2024-04-23](https://developer.tbd.website/blog/decentralized-apps/)\nWhen blockchain technology was first introduced a decade and a half ago, it made the possibility of a decentralized web seem viable to a mass audience. Since then, blockchains have proven themselves to be a poor solution to the majority of data storage problems outside of bearer assets - i.e. Bitcoin - because blockchains grow continuously without any ability to delete data, which just doesn’t make sense for things like personal data. But ‘blockchain’ isn’t synonymous with decentralization, and just because a blockchain isn’t the best solution for personal data storage doesn’t mean your app can’t be decentralized.\n\nThere are two common problems when trying to port a traditional centralized application over to the blockchain: data efficiency and data custody. In this post we’ll discuss why those two problems are blockers for most applications, and how Web5 components allow developers to build performant decentralized applications in a way that wasn't possible before.\n\nIt’s possible to make the argument that data such as GIS coordinates, historical data, or widely-used and immutable data are good candidates to be stored on the blockchain because there’s no need for deletion and a requirement for complete history. While blockchain isn’t the only storage method that meets the needs of these systems, those systems are the ones best suited to utilize blockchain. Despite that fact that those data are good candidates for blockchain, however, does not mean that blockchain is the best data storage solution for that data.\n\nHowever, blockchains are continuous ledgers of data that provide the benefit of immutability at the cost of storage inefficiency, which means that they aren’t great for storing large amounts of data or data sets in which there are large subsections of trivial or ignorable data. Firstly, their read times are slower than traditional data storage because the entire blockchain needs to be traversed for a read, and write times require settlement onto the blockchain which is out of an individual’s hands. As a result, the cost per transaction will likely be significantly higher on the blockchain when compared to traditional data storage, and that cost can grow over time.\n\nImagine an on-chain photo storage app that allows for users to encrypt their data. While this framework would technically allow for the replacement of large-scale cloud-based photo services that are run by centralized corporations, the end user experience would be tarnished by much slower speeds than what users have come to expect. That’s because blockchains are designed to store an immutable ledger of transactions (in this case uploads of photos), and knowing what photos belong to who would involve traversing the entirety of the blockchain. Queries to this kind of data storage are slow and expensive, as would be the proof-of-work or other verification method needed to add new blocks to the chain. As a result, while a photo sharing app, or any app that requires storage of large files, is theoretically possible on-chain, it isn’t very scalable or performant.\n\nA key tenet to the decentralized web is the idea of custody, or data ownership. Custody, or the ability to hold an asset in which only you have full access to it, breaks down into a handful of concerns including:\n\nPhysical storage ownership\n\nDeletion prevention\n\nCensorship resistance\n\nSpeed of use\n\nData interoperability\n\nA truly decentralized web makes it easy for each user to custody their own data, regardless of their reasoning for doing so. No matter a customer’s “why,” however, custody isn’t simply a matter of personal beliefs - it’s a feature that enables better user experience.\n\nWith blockchain technology, wallets don’t actually store your data - instead they address to your data on the blockchain via the public/private keys they hold and represent. This means, for example, that a crypto wallet doesn’t actually “store” your Bitcoins; it’s an address that is used as the identifier on transactions recorded on-chain, which can then be used to determine your wallet’s Bitcoin holdings.\n\nIn order to take custody of your on-chain data then you would need to run your own node on the blockchain network in question, which may not be a good solution for the average consumer. Additionally, in order to host a wallet that is available on all of your devices, that wallet will likely be hosted on a centralized third party’s servers.\n\nIt’s important to note that while the issues of wallet storage and running nodes aren’t unsolvable problems, they are inherently outside of the definitions of what a typical blockchain wallet does today.\n\nBearing in mind the limitations of custody and efficiency, it becomes clear that not a lot of data makes sense to be stored on-chain. However, just because you might not want to store important, large data like photos, or small, unimportant data like favicon history on-chain doesn’t mean that it isn’t possible to store that data in a decentralized way that offers custody and efficiency.\n\nKey Web5 technologies like Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs), and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) in supplement or in place of blockchain provide a framework for an internet that is both decentralized AND solves the issues we’ve discussed that blockchain alone can’t solve. It’s important to note that while the integration of these technologies with existing blockchain ecosystems isn’t unheard of, they are able to solve the issues with blockchain discussed above. Cumulatively, they offer a way to efficiently address data, store and replicate data in a decentralized manner, and maintain identity.\n\nA purely blockchain-focused wallet, as discussed previously, is simply a key pairing with an address that references ownership over transactions on the blockchain but doesn’t actually manage local or cloud storage. This means that any on-chain data, while decentralized, isn’t user-custodied unless they set up a node on the network in which they’re participating, which is something that in a blockchain context should happen in a separate app from the wallet.\n\nIn Web5, however, wallets are addressed via DIDs and are able to store data via DWeb Nodes - which can live on device and replicate storage remotely - rather than relying on storing everything on-chain or on the wallet developer’s cloud storage option. Because Web5 wallets are more robust than simply a wallet that connects to a blockchain, your Web5 wallet could theoretically manage running a blockchain node for you in addition to performing more standard “wallet” tasks like you might expect.\n\nAdditionally, because DWNs are able to replicate data across instances on different devices, it makes for self-custodying your data across devices much easier than with a blockchain wallet. While blockchain wallets require re-creating the private key pairings on another device and can pose a security risk, DIDs also offer ways to easily and securely port your DID between devices to replicate data and maintain a consistent user experience. You can imagine how great this is in the case of a photo storage app that is backed by a DWN that replicates data across your devices and makes sign-in on those devices easy!\n\nWhile blockchain wallets and Web5 wallets aren’t mutually exclusive - Web5 wallets can very well interact with blockchains and blockchain wallets may use concepts like DIDs and VCs -, what matters is that when users take advantage of wallet apps using DIDs, DWNs, and VCs, they can self-custody all their off-chain data and even their on-chain data should they be able to run a node locally.\n\nLedgers like the blockchain don’t make for performant databases in a lot of use cases, which is why DWNs are a breakthrough in combining decentralized web technologies with centralized web performance. While blockchains require ledger consensus and redundant storage to hold any type of data, DWNs are replicable nodes that can run any of the traditionally performant database technologies you’re used to - think SQL, MongoDB, etc. - without being tied to a centralized server.\n\nAs mentioned in our discussion about custody, you could run a DWN on your laptop, your phone, on your own server, or on rented server space from a cloud provider, and all of them can be synchronized to provide the kind of redundancy that we love about blockchain. As a result, DWNs are able to solve the problems of large file storage and off-chain storage.\n\nA performant decentralized web that offers users custody of their own data has been a tantalizing dream for almost two decades, but in that same timeframe blockchain technology has proven to not be the way to make that vision a reality. If you find yourself or your customers valuing decentralization, privacy, flexibility, and self-custodial apps, then Web5 provides the framework to achieve exactly those goals. Your Web5 app may very well leverage blockchain technology - a participating financial institution on the tbDEX protocol we’re developing is a great example of an app that uses Web5 tech to connect to blockchains, but there are lots of ways to build dApps with Web5.",

      "# [Hello DWAs - Building the decentralized future of PWAs by Chris Giglio on 2023-05-23](https://developer.tbd.website/blog/dwas-vs-pwas/)\nWhether or not you know the term, you know the experience of using a Progressive Web App (PWA): it’s the slick experience that enables you to install a web experience to your native device and enjoy the speed of use of a website with the tight system integration of a native app. They allow for experiences like recreating Starbucks’ native app in web, or for creating a highly 2G-optmized experience like what Uber created for some of their customers. PWAs take advantage of native features such as on-device storage, push notifications, and even windowing without requiring the overhead of a native app and the ability to install them without going through an app store.\n\nIn the same way that HTML5 and PWAs changed the way users expected to consume their apps through the minor addition of manifest, an even larger shift has arrived in the form of Decentralized Web Apps (DWAs), which combine PWAs with Web5. While PWAs redefined the relationship between the client and server by enabling richer on-device experiences through native integrations, DWAs are going to completely redefine data storage for apps resulting in a seismic shift in user privacy, ease-of-use, and data portability.\n\nThe basic client-server model that PWAs use is and has been the presumed standard for decades now. Users expect to open up their PWA, a client, that routinely makes API calls to a 3rd party service, the server, where all their data is stored and the business logic of the app lives. For example, a basic ToDo app PDA would provide you a UI to interface with all your action items by calling the API service that accesses those items; fundamentally the data and API layers live outside of the user’s control and ownership.\n\nIn DWAs, users own their own data and, as a result, their apps no longer need an API service because apps connect directly to the data source. This shift leads to virtually no UI/UX change, but triggers a radical change in app architecture because developers are now directly interfacing with a user’s data store instead of with app-owned server storage via API.\n\nIn DWAs, app data is stored in Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs), which are user-owned and redundant data stores capable of transmitting data that provide strong promises of privacy and guaranteed ownership. DWNs can be permissioned publicly or privately related to the querying decentralized identifier (DID) using permissions and protocols to allow select access to all the data stored in them.\n\nGoing back to our ToDo app example, a user would be able to store all of their todo items and app data on their own DWN rather than on a specific 3rd party’s servers, and all the app would do is focus on creating a presentation layer and additional features around the app’s concept.\n\nUpgrading to DWAs\n\nIf you want to migrate a PWA to a DWA, the only thing you’ll need to do is make sure that whatever data you were originally storing remotely and transmitting via API calls is now stored on the user’s DWN and is accessed using CRUD operations on the user’s DWN. For example, your ToDo app may have previously made an API call to write a new item to your list, but now you’d replace that API call with:\n\nYou might expect this section on how to migrate your PWA to a DWA to drag on, but that’s really it! Regardless of your front-end frameworks, you can easily turn your app into a DWA using our web5.js library with minimal code changes. So long as your application treats the user’s DWN as its data storage and allows the user to own their own data, your PWA is now a DWA.\n\nBenefits of a DWA\n\nEven though replacing all your API calls with DWA calls may be relatively easy work, convincing your users to get on board with Web5 and DWNs may be a challenge. So what’s in it for you and them when you build a DWA?\n\nUser ownership of data - users don’t have to worry about a server outage or be fearful of a company shutting down and losing all their data.\n\nData portability - because users are storing their own data in PWAs, they no longer need to be tied to a single service. Imagine, for example, a world with a decentralized Spotify and Tidal. If a Spotify user were to decide to leave the platform and migrate to Tidal, they’d own all their own playlist data and could therefore then give playlist access to Tidal so that all their data migrates seamlessly.\n\nReduced operational overhead - you no longer need to maintain a massive array of databases, clusters, and other infrastructure to host your simple PWA. Instead, a user can visit your DWA, plug in their DWN, and get to work.\n\nWhat’s Next?"

I recommend selecting a few target job titles, and then crafting a few different resumes - one for each of those titles.

I am last person to claim to be intelligent lol. DIY is the route people who plan on continuing to vape should go. From the old list of sweetener free vendors we had on here I think only two vendors left of out of the 25ish that were open ( one being Velvet Cloud that just reopened). Velvet Cloud throws me off due to their 100% vg only option. I don't build my own coils so not sure how that would work with my sub ohm devices/tanks. Been a very long time since tried 100% VG.\n\nSo Vapor Chef/Velvet Cloud or mass produced juice that has 4 to 10% sweetener in it because covers up the fact the juice sucks (You don't need sweetener in a good juice. Unless you just like sweetener which is fine if you do). I did order some stuff from Vapor Chef to see if I can recommend them. Hopefully they are as good as heard.  \n\n\nTruth is though 45 dollars for 120ML compared to DIY. The amount one will save going DIY is insane.\n\nLosing TBD was gut punch. :(\n\nLike I said if \"I\" can DIY you can do it also lol\n\n## Comment ID jw064dm with +5 score by [(C00bahR00bah, Reddit, 2023-08-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/15ptrkk/next_best_choice_since_tbd_permanently_closed/jw064dm/) (in reply to ID 15ptrkk):\nI recently ordered from dashvapes after seeing someone mention it here.

Nothing has changed on my end, this hasn't been an issue before.

I ordered it the 6th of December and signed up for text updates. Didn't receive a single update and it kept saying \"awaiting carrier pickup\" from both FN and the DHL website.\n\nThe delivery date was Dec 17th, then Dec 27th, then it changed to \"TBD\". It's still stuck on \"awaiting carrier pickup\". When I check DHL, it says my tracking number doesn't exist anymore. December 29th, without ever contacting them, they sent me an email saying that \"I requested to receive store credit\" which I never did??\n\nI tried contacting Fashion Nova and they said that they tried to deliver but no one was home or I put in the wrong address, because it's been marked as \"return to sender\". I know this is a blatant lie since I put in the right address, it never updated me to say it was on its way/to be delivered, and I was waiting on several important packages that needed signatures during those weeks (so I was home). \n\nThey still double down and say they don't provide refunds and that it's my fault. I've tried calling DHL Global on two different numbers multiple times/days and every time they say \"every one of our employees are in a company-wide meeting, please try again later\" and hang up. They ignored my email with an automatic answer bot. So I can't even reach DHL either?? \n\nI'm ripping my hair out here! Wth is going on??

What I feel may have happened is that maybe somehow there was an issue with an item that you ordered and it was no longer available and I'm sure that was an error on their part and this is the way they went about it. The good thing about m is that the store credit never expires or loses its value. But no it is an actual store that does their deliveries usually fairly well actually, so I'm sorry this happened to you. It is obnoxious that they don't do any returns but I guess that's also selfish of me to say as a patron who would prefer that. If you're sure you put the correct address and it was a house or there was an apartment number included and you didn't ask specifically for someone to have to sign for the package, then I feel it's what I guessed above. I'd give them another shot if you like their clothes, and if not, then I would just contact my banking institution and reported us wrong.

I went and checked the BBB and found out that fashion nova apparently got sued/taken to court by the FTC for doing exactly what has happened to me, so no I don't think I will be trusting them again.\n\n#### Comment ID j4otfp3 with +2 score by [(_ericamarta, Reddit, 2023-01-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fashionnova/comments/10dpmd8/so_is_fashion_nova_just_a_huge_scam/j4otfp3/) (in reply to ID j4ola5m):\nWait, what? I happened to use voice dictation when replying earlier as I'm doing now as well, but I just read over my response and I never used the word us not once. So I'm not sure what you're referring to. In addition, not only do I not work for them, but I'm also not sponsored by them either. @_ericamarta is my Instagram and tick tock handle although as an influencer I would loveingly accept sponsorship from one of several brands including but not limited to them. Mind you, this is coming from someone who quite literally just told you they also had a negative experience with them because I think they're no return policy is obnoxious I said, and that I wish they offered it lol. All I did was share the info that I know. When I was pregnant I ordered a bunch of dresses from them and I had no idea that was the return policy. I ordered different sizes for my baby shower and I went back and forth in several emails extremely upset asking for a one-time courtesy for a full refund and they wouldn't do it, they would not budge and I wasn't a fan of that. So I didn't order again for an entire year. When I said it's not a scam, I'm telling you that I know for a fact I have received orders and many friends that have as well. If apparently they've had issues where some people have not received their orders, I have no idea about that. Maybe you're right! But again I think it would go to what I said above. First and foremost you don't work for them, so I don't know how you're saying they were in stock. You act like there aren't website glitches and it could have said your size was in stock and it was an error, or what I said in the first reply which was that your item absolutely was in stock, and because of such an influx of many orders on the same item I literally said maybe they messed up and then realized it was their error that they never packaged your stuff on time and you were left without one of those items and instead of being forthright, they did the song and dance that they did above. So once more, if you are certain that you didn't ask for a signature upon arrival, and or that you put the correct address I'm pretty sure I'm right because I don't understand what reason they would have to not make their money. I also told you how to try to get your money back if that's what you want which is the contact your banking institution. You missed the ball big time on this one love, I have no work affiliation with them whatsoever and no dog in this fight. I was sharing my truth and experiences, and giving you an idea on how to get your money back. Anyway, sending you let in love. Be blessed and best of luck in this situation!\n\n#### Comment ID kqw4jqi with +2 score by [(No-Week1436, Reddit, 2024-02-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fashionnova/comments/10dpmd8/so_is_fashion_nova_just_a_huge_scam/kqw4jqi/) (in reply to ID j4ola5m):\nYou may have been  scammed.... it probably wasn't fashion nova you actually ordered from... scammers use their site and logo\n\n### Comment ID kur21x6 with +2 score by [(SignificantCloud1417, Reddit, 2024-03-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fashionnova/comments/10dpmd8/so_is_fashion_nova_just_a_huge_scam/kur21x6/) (in reply to ID j4oi1pa):\nNo because I ordered and still.havevnot received my order.

Ironically, the one I bought  that's his usual size is way too big and long. As their sizing is off, we should not be stuck with store credit. In addition, I had to pay to send back two parcels.

I guess people can say just trade in your Wii U games, but that won't make up the difference and I'm actually keeping my Wii U since there are so many indie games on it. It would be dumb to just get rid of my entire library on it. But with the DLC I basically have MK8 Deluxe besides the battle mode so it's a hard sell. I REALLY wish Nintendo would actually throw the dedicated Wii U base a bone, but they don't seem like they'll be doing that. They are out to make money just like every other company, but a part of me feels like they still owe a little good will to their dedicated fan-base.\n\nIf they made MK8 Deluxe 49.99 at least I would be happy. Take 10 bucks off... AT LEAST. It's not like they had to do that much and build the game from the ground up for Switch.

It's just high for us people who already own MK8 on Wii U and will be buying it again :(\n\nEdit: parenthesis.\n\n### Comment ID de6otae with +1 score by [(Soxicide, Reddit, 2017-02-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/5vztxo/nintendos_us_website_changed_mario_kart_8_deluxes/de6otae/) (in reply to ID de6699k):\nAnd with that we may be on the eve of the best Nintendo console ever.\n\n## Comment ID de669p2 with +410 score by [(bensly, Reddit, 2017-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/5vztxo/nintendos_us_website_changed_mario_kart_8_deluxes/de669p2/) (in reply to ID 5vztxo):\n$69.69\n\n### Comment ID de66cad with +197 score by [(TyHarWood, Reddit, 2017-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/5vztxo/nintendos_us_website_changed_mario_kart_8_deluxes/de66cad/) (in reply to ID de669p2):\nDeluXXXe\n\n#### Comment ID de69olx with +21 score by [(FierceDeity_, Reddit, 2017-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/5vztxo/nintendos_us_website_changed_mario_kart_8_deluxes/de69olx/) (in reply to ID de66cad):\nBMX XXX\n\n#### Comment ID de6sapi with +5 score by [(theironwaffles, Reddit, 2017-02-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/5vztxo/nintendos_us_website_changed_mario_kart_8_deluxes/de6sapi/) (in reply to ID de66cad):\npornographic Mario Kart?

Most games released for $60 in 2014 are not still $60 at retail.  That pricing policy is virtually exclusive to Nintendo.  Plenty of top games on competing platforms now get re-released at a bargain price with the DLC included.\n\nThe battle mode tracks are all-new and not existing DLC, but it's also not bonus content — it's something that had been included in every Mario Kart until Mario Kart 8.  Arguably, those of us who bought it for Wii U vastly overpaid, and now everyone who will buy it for Nintendo Switch will also overpay, and those who ultimately buy it for both platforms will overpay twice.\n\nBut at the end of the day, buying video games is entirely optional, and Nintendo is allowed to charge what they wish no matter how out of step they are with the rest of the industry, and anyone who is price-sensitive really shouldn't be a Nintendo fan, because this is just the way that Nintendo does business.\n\n#### Comment ID de71srp with +1 score by [(re1078, Reddit, 2017-02-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/5vztxo/nintendos_us_website_changed_mario_kart_8_deluxes/de71srp/) (in reply to ID de6j8hn):\nIt would be amazing if they would offer a trade in deal, I know that won't be happening but I can dream.\n\n### Comment ID de6cshi with +12 score by [(-_ellipsis_-, Reddit, 2017-02-24)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/5vztxo/nintendos_us_website_changed_mario_kart_8_deluxes/de6cshi/) (in reply to ID de6abvz):\nRight there with you.

Once all the defects started getting revealed and the recalls and delays were announced, I got an email, maybe about a week and a half ago, saying my pick up date was moved to August 23. I just got an email today saying that it's been delayed AGAIN, but now with a TBD placeholder. Anyone else get an email like that? And does anyone have any idea when we'll be getting the earphones now? \n\nUPDATE: Samsung sent me an email asking me to review my new Buds3 Pros.

I got them for an absurd deal, so I don't mind using my APP2 until then.\n\n### Comment ID leul55y with +1 score by [(Navycrew91, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/leul55y/) (in reply to ID leul0pr):\nYeah, the nice deal I got is the only reason I'm not cancelling my order, I know I'm not likely to get a deal like this in the future\n\n## Comment ID leux6tw with +2 score by [(chicopepsi, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/leux6tw/) (in reply to ID 1ebidoy):\nYeah, got the email last night\n\n## Comment ID lev2lhx with +2 score by [(blake72143, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/lev2lhx/) (in reply to ID 1ebidoy):\nI don’t understand what’s going on here. My email says “TBD,” Best Buy says the 23rd, and Samsung says the 28th. I’m afraid to even talk to a Samsung representative because they swore I would be able to pick them up from Best Buy on July 23rd and Best Buy said the same when I called them. I’ve been a Samsung user since the first Galaxy Note (I miss the Note 4 with the universal remote IR blaster), and I have preordered every single item I’ve ever had from the Note 8 to the S24U. (Trade-ins and the incentives mean I rarely pay even *half* the cost of anything, so I just keep that ball rolling.) That’s several phones, tablets, watches, and buds. I’ve never had a single issue aside from a shipper goofing my N20U delivery, and Samsung gave me a $100 credit to spend on any accessories, chargers, etc., for a mobile device. It wasn’t even their fault. Now I can’t even get a straightforward answer on anything for these. I understand that things can go wrong, sometimes catastrophically, but just give me some details, and I’m fine. I hate being in the dark like this.

Same status and everything. Only thing that keeps changing is the estimated arrival date, which keeps getting pushed forward by 3 days, every time the expected delivery date has come and gone smh. I've also read that the dates shown in the Samsung Store/Site/Shop Samsung app mean absolutely nothing, as other individuals on different forums and subreddits regarding the Buds Fiasco have received their non-buds products already, even though the Shop Samsung app states their product hasnt even shipped yet. As such, I wouldnt use the ETA shown in the Shop Sams app as an accurate point of reference. Either contact Sams Supp, or check for email updates. I preordered just about immediately when they opened up, and JUST received the delayed shipping email from Samsung today?!?!?... 3 weeks to the day since i placed my pre-order for the buds 3 pro silver.\n\n#### Comment ID lfso4ck with +1 score by [(KSamV, Reddit, 2024-07-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/lfso4ck/) (in reply to ID lfrxyua):\nHmm interesting, reason why I asked cuz I saw some people it still said preorder and mine got changed from preorder to in process\n\n## Comment ID leu0uzm with +1 score by [(1pwntrolz, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/leu0uzm/) (in reply to ID 1ebidoy):\nMine is delayed too, but isn't it better to  delayed than to receive defective items?\n\n### Comment ID leulkue with +2 score by [(Navycrew91, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/leulkue/) (in reply to ID leu0uzm):\nI don't mind the delay, I'm just wishing they'd give us more info on the delay.

So, for that reason, it makes perfect sense. If you're not going to save any extra, then I would agree that it could make sense to not preorder. Also, if you can return the product if you don't like it with no penalty (like with many Samsung products), then it also may be worth preordering.\n\n## Comment ID let40y6 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/let40y6/) (in reply to ID 1ebidoy):\nI'm sitting here rocking out with my Buds 3 Pro and reading the comments.

I think I'll wait for the iPhone 16 and AW ultra 3 announcements and plan my route. I'm so deep down in Samsung ecosystem that a switch will cost me a fortune but I'll do it if nothing changes until October. We'll see..."

We have several managers and employees working on our Host Management Team. Our Human Resources team is always available to help as well.\r\n\r\nOur management team prides itself on listening to concerns and suggestions. We do not condone employees attacking one and the other. Respectful interactions are integral to our culture. Our hosts come from all walks of life, as you say. We value everyone's opinion, and feedback is vital to improving processes and interactions. That is one way we have become so successful.\r\n\r\nAs for your comment about salary, our hosts start at $20.00 per hour. This rate is advertised across our job boards. We continually review pay rates to ensure we are providing competitive pay. Also, tenured hosts can earn more. Plus, there are bonuses for referring candidates and venues to Sporcle.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your input.\r\n \r\nThanks,\r\nAli",

They want the hosts to take on a lot of additional work in terms of marketing &amp; Facebook promotion. Overall, hosts are being asked to provide quite a lot of unpaid labor, without many opportunities to advance their compensation over time. My guess is that we are actually taking home more like $10/hour. That's pretty terrible, and it may explain why the company seems to be having problems with hiring &amp; retention.

That leaves many hosts to beg relentlessly for tips (which, in my experience, aren't particularly good.) While you aren't micromanaged, you also have to handle a lot of things yourself. You also have to use your own equipment (e.g., computer if you're running a PPT show, phone to run music, HDMI cords for venues that don't have them, etc.) Communication from the host management team can be spotty and unreliable. I've had messages from venues not get relayed. I've asked questions to the host management team that have gone unanswered for extended periods.",

My personal regular per event pay has decreased since the transition to Sporcle (exacerbated by recent increased costs on our end including travel to and from venues), and while they say opportunities exist to make more, in practice this is extremely difficult to do for weekly events. It’s heavily venue dependent - for some folks, no matter how great they are at the job, they’ll just never get enough players to meaningfully exceed the minimum more than a dollar here or there. “Raises” based on tenure are in the form of an increased maximum, not minimum, which for many of us does not change the amount of money we actually see in our checks. The real money is in private events, though opportunities for those are more limited and they come with other issues to deal with. Tips happen but are rare as many folks assume we are paid much more than we are. Some staff are responsive and helpful. Others not so much. There are very often miscommunications, or information collected from customers is simply not passed on to hosts clearly (or at all), which can make us look bad or result in a lot of back and forth. Feedback is collected frequently and has been acted on on occasion, but seems like it is often ignored or we are assured they know better than the hosts (who are out there with players every day and know what they do and do not like) and nothing needs to change. Having seen the pay recently offered for non-Host jobs (part time and/or almost comically low for the reality of 2022), it sort of explains the problems I see among some of the full time staff.",

Some people did very little in 40 hours of work for little criticism, and some people did upwards of 60 hours of work without management comprehending that yes, the tasks took that long. \r\n- The pay was poor compared to seemingly equivalent jobs, and a number of corporate team members needed to host trivia additionally to make ends meet\r\n- No framework in place for when a host creates issues/harasses team members or other hosts, or players -- only for when a host upsets a venue.\r\n- Upper management speculated openly to each other and co-workers about the sexuality and relationships of employees\r\n- The CEO frequently retweets and likes content regarding how \"working for anyone is a scam,\" \"fit people are smarter than fat people,\" and other values that feel absolutely wild for the company Sporcle claims to be.\r\n- Overall, it's likely not to be a good culture fit or a place that one can grow if you are not a very specific type of white man who can rub elbows with the people in charge.",

Some people did very little in 40 hours of work for little criticism, and some people did upwards of 60 hours of work without management comprehending that yes, the tasks took that long. \r\n- The pay was poor compared to seemingly equivalent jobs, and a number of corporate team members needed to host trivia additionally to make ends meet\r\n- No framework in place for when a host creates issues/harasses team members or other hosts, or players -- only for when a host upsets a venue.\r\n- Upper management speculated openly to each other and co-workers about the sexuality and relationships of employees\r\n- The CEO frequently retweets and likes content regarding how \"working for anyone is a scam,\" \"fit people are smarter than fat people,\" and other values that feel absolutely wild for the company Sporcle claims to be.\r\n- Overall, it's likely not to be a good culture fit or a place that one can grow if you are not a very specific type of white man who can rub elbows with the people in charge.",

        "cons": "They pay less than when they first acquired our trivia company. Their \"raises\" are a joke. They make a near impossible numbers to hit, and then the pitiful raise only comes in AFTER you hit the impossible numbers. Try to tell full time employees anything and they will tell you that you are wrong, whether it be question wording, issues with their website, or really any other issue. They are paid very little and I don't think they have much experience, so any constructive criticism given is taken as a direct assault on their jobs and they defend minor issues by ostracizing people that bring up issues. This results in people stopping giving any feedback and a cult like mentality of the full time employees that everything works fine, and that people that give non-positive feedback are the \"real\" problem.",

        "advice": "Pay everyone more, including your non-hosts! It’s the cost of business these days and pay is no longer as competitive as you think it is for the skill and time required to really do this job well and keep customers coming back. Listen to your hosts and don’t overcomplicate things - plenty of people out there just want to have a beer and answer some questions without unnecessarily complex question formats, all the other layers of competition, stats, etc. Provide real opportunities to make additional money based on tenure or performance, that actually results in larger paychecks regardless of venue.",
        "cons": "Pay is no longer adequate for the effort put in. My personal regular per event pay has decreased since the transition to Sporcle (exacerbated by recent increased costs on our end including travel to and from venues), and while they say opportunities exist to make more, in practice this is extremely difficult to do for weekly events. It’s heavily venue dependent - for some folks, no matter how great they are at the job, they’ll just never get enough players to meaningfully exceed the minimum more than a dollar here or there. “Raises” based on tenure are in the form of an increased maximum, not minimum, which for many of us does not change the amount of money we actually see in our checks. The real money is in private events, though opportunities for those are more limited and they come with other issues to deal with. Tips happen but are rare as many folks assume we are paid much more than we are. Some staff are responsive and helpful. Others not so much. There are very often miscommunications, or information collected from customers is simply not passed on to hosts clearly (or at all), which can make us look bad or result in a lot of back and forth. Feedback is collected frequently and has been acted on on occasion, but seems like it is often ignored or we are assured they know better than the hosts (who are out there with players every day and know what they do and do not like) and nothing needs to change. Having seen the pay recently offered for non-Host jobs (part time and/or almost comically low for the reality of 2022), it sort of explains the problems I see among some of the full time staff.",
        "lengthOfEmployment": 2,
        "pros": "I love my players and my bar. Things run relatively smoothly when you don’t need to interact with Sporcle HQ too much (like for a well established regular weekly game.) Depending on your location, there can be good opportunities to pick up extra events and coverage for extra pay, and scheduling is pretty flexible. Some of their technology does make things easier and more efficient for hosts compared to similar companies.",

        "advice": "With prep, travel, setup, etc., most hosts are putting in at least 5 hours per show. They're also paying their own gas, insurance, vehicle maintenance, etc., as well as incidental costs associated with computers and other equipment. They want the hosts to take on a lot of additional work in terms of marketing &amp; Facebook promotion. Overall, hosts are being asked to provide quite a lot of unpaid labor, without many opportunities to advance their compensation over time. My guess is that we are actually taking home more like $10/hour. That's pretty terrible, and it may explain why the company seems to be having problems with hiring &amp; retention. But I guess it's better than McDonalds.",
        "cons": "Their pay hasn't kept up with the times and rapidly-spiraling gas costs. In another review, someone from Sporcle asserted that they pay $20 an hour, but with prep, travel, and setup time it actually maths out to much, much less than that. That leaves many hosts to beg relentlessly for tips (which, in my experience, aren't particularly good.) While you aren't micromanaged, you also have to handle a lot of things yourself. You also have to use your own equipment (e.g., computer if you're running a PPT show, phone to run music, HDMI cords for venues that don't have them, etc.) Communication from the host management team can be spotty and unreliable. I've had messages from venues not get relayed. I've asked questions to the host management team that have gone unanswered for extended periods.",
        "lengthOfEmployment": 2,
        "pros": "It's a fun job if you like to perform and build relationships with the regular trivia teams who attend shows. As a host, you enjoy a high degree of autonomy and you aren't micromanaged. Sporcle provides pretty good equipment (though it's complicated and WAYYYY too big to haul from venue to venue.) Shows are in the evening hours, which may make this a convenient part-time option for those who are already working two or three other jobs during the daylight hours.",

At its core, the tbDEX protocol facilitates the formation of mutual trust between counterparties on an open and permissionless network. It also enables counterparties to negotiate requirements to enable compliant transactions. Yellow Card becomes the first Participating Financial Institution (PFI) on tbDEX that offers liquidity across 20 African countries.\n\nâtbDEX bridges the gap between the old and the new â enabling anyone to benefit from decentralized payment systems and digital assets, with easy on- and off-ramps to legacy payment systems and fiat currencies.â says Emily Chiu, COO of TBD. âFor developers, adopting the tbDEX protocol unlocks global liquidity for their customers, while avoiding the complexity associated with bespoke API integrations with each and every provider.â\n\nRe-Imagining a New World of Payments and Commerce\n\nGlobally, 1.7 billion adults lack access to the banking system, yet two-thirds of them own a mobile phone that could help them access financial services. The internet and wireless technology has given us the information infrastructure we need to serve everybody, but money and payments have not kept pace.\n\nAn open, decentralized financial system will enable people and institutions to exchange value and transact with each other globally, and at significantly lower costs and more inclusively than what traditional financial systems allow. tbDEX was formed as an open source, permissionless protocol out of a desire to enable everyone to participate in this vision for the future.\n\nâCore to tbDEXâs innovation is the creation of a trust protocol for the exchange of value. This is useful for bitcoin, stablecoins, digital assets, and traditional fiat alike â by creating a standardized way to establish trusted economic and commercial transactions on the internet through an internet-native financial protocol,â says Mike Brock, CEO of TBD. âThe absence of trust in payments means youâll have more fraud, misrouted payments, and higher financial losses. This increases the cost of financial transactions for everyone.â\n\ntbDEX Protocol: A New Trust and Identity Layer for Digital Payments\n\nThe tbDEX protocol creates a bridge, based on open standards, that connects the world of legacy money to digital money and assets, without the need for centralized intermediaries or governance tokens. True to open source practices, tbDEX is a protocol that is available to everyone, but owned by no one.\n\nThe protocol enables participants to securely validate counterparty identity and trust, as well as desired compliance with relevant laws and regulations. After trust establishment, tbDEXâs standard messaging protocol enables Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) and counterparties to discover, negotiate, and confirm transactions using a bid and ask system. Once transaction details are confirmed, participants execute and settle these trades outside of the protocol.\n\ntbDEX Protocol: A New Trust and Identity Layer for Digital Payments\n\nThe tbDEX protocol creates a bridge, based on open standards, that connects the world of legacy money to digital money and assets, without the need for centralized intermediaries or governance tokens.

      "# [Sutter Health Park Effects...TBD by Nico on 2024-10-12](https://www.athleticsnation.com/2024/10/12/24268323/sutter-health-park-effects-tbd-j-p-sears-joey-estes-sacramento-river-cats-meow)\nThe presumption seems to be that the A’s are moving to a launching pad in 2025, and so long as 40% of the rotation includes JP Sears and Joey Estes I suppose HRs will not be in short supply.\n\nBut some of the notion of Sacramento as a hitter’s paradise comes from perception that does not necessarily mirror reality. Sutter is being contrasted with the pitcher friendly Oakland Coliseum, with its vast foul territory and evening marine layer. Certainly, a park with normal amounts of foul ground and no heavy fog will play more fairly for the hitters.\n\nThe other perception altering factor is the temperature. It is presumed that any climate that reaches 100 degrees will be conducive to the long ball, but Sacramento is not the Las Vegas desert nor does it feature the Denver altitude. And HRs are only one measure of offense — hot days don’t help a ball scoot through the infield or find acreage in right-center field.\n\nSome truths about Sutter Health Park: the dimensions are comparable to the Coliseum. In fact it is an identical 330 feet to straightaway LF and a few feet deeper to CF at 403 feet. RF is 5 feet shorter at 325 feet. So it is not a “band box” by any means.\n\nAlso, while summers do get over 100 degrees in Sacramento the vast majority of the games are going to be scheduled at night to offset the heat, and so game time temperatures will generally be in the 80s and falling throughout the evening.\n\nOn the flip side, if they do in fact make the horrible and irresponsible decision to install turf that will likely create more offense by way of balls scooting faster through the infield and in the outfield.\n\nPut it all together and certainly you won’t have a pitcher’s park like the A’s have played in for decades. But it’s unclear how much of a hitter’s park it will be or how much it might play “fair” or “neutral”.\n\nI guess it’s looking like the field will play “a bit the hitter-y side of neutral,” which is certainly a significant shift from what A’s fans are accustomed to. But depending on how the turf (if it’s turf) is actually designed and installed, you could conceivably have a surface that slowed down balls a touch more than natural grass, which could in turn shift the metrics radically.\n\nI guess what I’m pointing out is that in a scenario where the grass/turf surface actually favors the defense over the batter, in the 4th inning where the temperature is in the mid-70s and it’s still 325-330 to the corners and 403 to CF...we probably shouldn’t jump to assume games are going to be 9-7.\n\nI do know this: if you’re an A’s hitter who has called the Coliseum home and who has seen his batting average take the usual .010-.020 point dip from foul balls that never made it into the seats and the relentless marine layer, you might be looking forward to at least the level playing field Sacramento will offer.\n\nBut this isn’t Fenway Park with it’s “310 feet” to LF (cough under 300 cough) or Wrigley Field with the wind blowing fiercely out. If you’re a hitter, you will still have to hit the ball well and if you’re a pitcher you should have a fighting chance.\n\nOne question the A’s front office has to consider is: do they want to factor in their new home park in how they build their roster, and if so how should they tilt? This becomes a more difficult strategy when you don’t know, exactly, what to expect. And we won’t really know until the A’s play some games there — yes, the River Cats have previewed life on the field but AAA baseball just isn’t the same game as the MLB version.\n\nWe will find out in 5.5 months just how the field plays, by which time it will even have a playing surface ready to play on. Until then all we can do is conjecture, so: conjecture away. What do you expect? And how should the A’s plan for life at Sutter Health Park in order to gain a home field advantage?",

LDA made updates and enhancements to its prior system and has launched a new site to provide patients with information about doctors, other practitioners, testing labs, and pharmacies that are knowledgeable about chronic Lyme disease and often about many other tick-borne diseases (TBD). Many of the doctors listed are often referred to as Lyme Literate Physicians/Doctors (LLMD). Tens of thousands of patients have successfully used the prior LDA system to locate Lyme and TBD resources.\n\nTerms & Conditions and Guidelines\n\nBecause there is a negative political climate surrounding Lyme disease, many LLMDs do not want their names posted outright on the internet. LDA has tried to balance the doctors’ wishes with patients’ need to find a doctor. This new system is a result of that compromise and therefore:\n\nLDA permits searches over a calendar month period that will result in access to up to 15 Doctor Referrals. To access a Doctor Referral listing, first conduct a search, and then click on the desired provider from the results that populate. Clicking on a listing will re-direct you to that provider’s page which will include all necessary contact information. The system enables you to click on up to 15 Doctor Referrals every calendar month period.\n\nSearches can be refined based on the search location (street address, city, zip code or country), search radius (distance from the starting point), category filter(s), and/or keyword search.\n\nBecause of the limited number of physicians treating chronic Lyme disease nationwide, some states, and in some instances, entire regions, may not have any treating physicians who follow flexible treating approaches such as those in the International Lyme & Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) Guidelines, Evidence Assessments and Guideline Recommendations in Lyme Disease: The Clinical Management of Known Tick Bites, Erythema Migrans Rashes and Persistent Disease. In the event that the LDA Doctor Referral System © contains no Lyme or TBD resource listings in a given area, the closest possible option(s) will populate based on the location entered and specaialty/ies selected. The LDA appreciates any changes in provider information that you may find and make us aware of so we can investigate.\n\nSome providers may not specifically treat Lyme and TBD but see patients who have symptoms associated with Lyme and TBD to address those specific symptoms. Contact the provider to confirm.\n\nIt is your responsibility to contact the provider’s office to confirm the current address, directions, nature of services provided, and all other provider information before you make an appointment.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Lyme Disease Association, Inc. provides referrals to health care providers who treat Lyme disease, and often other TBD, as a courtesy to those seeking Lyme Literate Physicians (LLMD). However, some of the providers included do not specifically treat Lyme and TBD but see patients who have symptoms associated with Lyme and TBD to address those specific symptoms. We do not evaluate the professional competence or qualifications of health care providers on our referral list or the costs of services provided. Accordingly, the LDA neither warrants nor endorses the health care providers contained on this list nor the quality of care you will receive from those providers. We do not make recommendations, only referrals. LDA does not receive any monies from physicians to be included on this list nor does LDA provide any monies to physicians. Because of the limited number of physicians treating chronic Lyme disease nationwide, some states, and in some instances, entire regions, may not have any treating physicians who follow flexible treating approaches such as those in the International Lyme & Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) Guidelines: Evidence Assessments and Guideline Recommendations in Lyme Disease: The Clinical Management of Known Tick Bites, Erythema Migrans Rashes and Persistent Disease. In the event that the Doctor Referral System contains no Lyme or TBD resource listings in a given area, the closest possible option(s) will populate based on the zip code entered and category/ies selected. The LDA appreciates any changes in provider information that you may find and make us aware of.\n\nLDA does not accept or reply to any comments on:\n\nWhat insurance a doctor accepts or does not accept, or if any insurance is accepted.\n\nHow listed doctors practice or any other aspect of the doctor-patient relationship.\n\nThe cost or fees charged by any healthcare provider.\n\nWhy a particular doctor is or is not listed.\n\nRequest for providers that treat COVID-19, although some of the providers in the system may treat COVID.\n\nWe cannot guarantee that the information provided will be timely and accurate or that physicians on the list are accepting new patients, or that they accept insurance. The selection of a physician should be made by you after careful consideration. There are two approaches in the treatment of Lyme disease. Our list contains physicians who generally follow more flexible treatment approaches than those advocated by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). LDA is not responsible for incorrect information on the website. BEFORE DOCTOR VISIT: Please contact the physicians’ offices directly to confirm their current address, directions, and any other necessary information before scheduling an appointment. Do not rely only on the maps provided on this site. The maps on LDA’s Doctor Referral System are for informational purposes and provide an approximate locality of the listing based on the addresses we are provided with at the time of site updates.

      "# [Transportation Benefit District](https://www.cityoftacoma.org/government/city_council/transportation_benefit_district)\nAbout Tacoma Transportation Benefit District\n\nOn November 20, 2012, the Tacoma City Council created the Transportation Benefit District (TBD), through passage of Ordinance No. 28099, that established a TBD for the purposes of acquiring, constructing, improving, providing, and funding transportation improvements within the TBD consistent with any state, regional, or local transportation plans, and necessitated by existing or reasonably foreseeable congestion levels.\n\nOn November 27, 2012, The Tacoma Transportation Benefit District Board authorized a vehicle license fee of $20. In June of 2013, the Washington State Department of Licensing began collecting vehicle license fees on behalf of the TBD to fund local transportation improvements within the district. The $20 vehicle license fee generates almost $5M in a biennium (the TBD spend plan is linked below).\n\nIn 2015 Tacoma residents passed Transportation Benefit District Proposition A, which permits the TBD to levy an additional sales tax of 1/10 of 1% for a period of ten years (for more information visit the Tacoma Streets Initiative webpage). Proposition A is projected to generate $4.5 million per year, or $45 million over the ten-year period. The additional funding will go towards transportation projects outlined in the Comprehensive Transportation Program including permanent pothole repair, street resurfacing, maintenance and improvements to arterials and freight access roads, installation of school crossing beacons, and building missing sidewalks.\n\nAgendas, Minutes and Videos on Legistar\n\nWhat is a Transportation Benefit District?"

    "# Comprehensive Analyst Report on TBD and tbDEX\n\n## Company Overview: TBD\n\nTBD is a subsidiary of Block, Inc., focused on developing open-source decentralized technologies. The company aims to create a more inclusive financial ecosystem by leveraging blockchain technology to enhance global commerce and financial access. TBD's mission is to bridge the gap between traditional financial systems and decentralized payment solutions, enabling users to transact with lower costs and greater efficiency. The company is committed to open-source practices, ensuring that its technologies are accessible to everyone while being owned by no one [(TBD, TBD Website, 2024)](https://tbd.website/blog/tbd-unveils-tech-preview-of-tbdex-open-source-liquidity-protocol-to-reimagine-global-payments-and-commerce).\n\n## Product Overview: tbDEX\n\ntbDEX is an open-source liquidity and trust protocol designed to facilitate frictionless commerce and financial access globally. The protocol aims to create mutual trust between counterparties on an open and permissionless network, allowing for compliant transactions without the need for centralized intermediaries. The tbDEX protocol is particularly significant as it addresses the needs of the 1.7 billion adults worldwide who lack access to traditional banking systems, despite many owning mobile phones that could facilitate financial services [(TBD, TBD Website, 2024)](https://tbd.website/blog/tbd-unveils-tech-preview-of-tbdex-open-source-liquidity-protocol-to-reimagine-global-payments-and-commerce).\n\n### Key Features of tbDEX\n\n- **Trust Protocol**: tbDEX establishes a standardized way to create trusted economic and commercial transactions on the internet, which is essential for various forms of currency, including bitcoin, stablecoins, and fiat [(TBD, TBD Website, 2024)](https://tbd.website/blog/tbd-unveils-tech-preview-of-tbdex-open-source-liquidity-protocol-to-reimagine-global-payments-and-commerce).\n  \n- **Decentralized Transactions**: The protocol allows participants to validate counterparty identity and trust while ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Transactions are negotiated and confirmed using a bid and ask system, executed outside the protocol once details are settled [(TBD, TBD Website, 2024)](https://tbd.website/blog/tbd-unveils-tech-preview-of-tbdex-open-source-liquidity-protocol-to-reimagine-global-payments-and-commerce).\n\n- **Global Liquidity**: By adopting the tbDEX protocol, developers can unlock global liquidity for their customers, simplifying the integration process with various financial providers [(TBD, TBD Website, 2024)](https://tbd.website/blog/tbd-unveils-tech-preview-of-tbdex-open-source-liquidity-protocol-to-reimagine-global-payments-and-commerce).\n\n## Recent Developments\n\n### Partnerships and Collaborations\n\nRecently, Yellow Card became the first Participating Financial Institution (PFI) on tbDEX, offering liquidity across 20 African countries. This partnership is a significant step in expanding tbDEX's reach and utility in emerging markets, where access to financial services is often limited [(TBD, TBD Website, 2024)](https://tbd.website/blog/tbd-unveils-tech-preview-of-tbdex-open-source-liquidity-protocol-to-reimagine-global-payments-and-commerce).\n\n### Executive Insights\n\nEmily Chiu, COO of TBD, emphasized the importance of tbDEX in bridging traditional and decentralized financial systems, stating, “tbDEX bridges the gap between the old and the new – enabling anyone to benefit from decentralized payment systems and digital assets” [(TBD, TBD Website, 2024)](https://tbd.website/blog/tbd-unveils-tech-preview-of-tbdex-open-source-liquidity-protocol-to-reimagine-global-payments-and-commerce). Mike Brock, CEO of TBD, highlighted the protocol's role in reducing fraud and financial losses, noting, “The absence of trust in payments means you’ll have more fraud, misrouted payments, and higher financial losses” [(TBD, TBD Website, 2024)](https://tbd.website/blog/tbd-unveils-tech-preview-of-tbdex-open-source-liquidity-protocol-to-reimagine-global-payments-and-commerce).\n\n## Company Scale and Market Position\n\nWhile specific employee numbers and revenue figures for TBD are not disclosed in the available sources, the company's affiliation with Block, Inc. suggests a robust backing and potential for significant growth in the decentralized finance sector. The focus on open-source technology positions TBD favorably in a rapidly evolving market that increasingly values transparency and accessibility.\n\n## Community Engagement and Events\n\nTBD is actively engaging with the developer community through initiatives like Hacktoberfest 2024, which encourages contributions to open-source projects. This event not only fosters community involvement but also enhances the visibility and adoption of TBD's technologies [(TBD, TBD Developer Website, 2024)](https://developer.tbd.website/blog/hacktoberfest-2024/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTBD is making significant strides in the decentralized finance space with its tbDEX protocol, which aims to enhance global financial access and trust. The recent partnership with Yellow Card and the active engagement in community events highlight TBD's commitment to fostering an inclusive financial ecosystem. As the company continues to develop its technologies and expand its partnerships, it presents a compelling opportunity for prospective candidates and investors interested in the future of decentralized finance."
