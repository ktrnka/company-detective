When we booked, we don't believe we were given the option to add a second guest name at that time. \n\nDoes anyone know the process?

Once all the defects started getting revealed and the recalls and delays were announced, I got an email, maybe about a week and a half ago, saying my pick up date was moved to August 23. I just got an email today saying that it's been delayed AGAIN, but now with a TBD placeholder. Anyone else get an email like that? And does anyone have any idea when we'll be getting the earphones now? \n\nUPDATE: Samsung sent me an email asking me to review my new Buds3 Pros.

Granted, yes, this first new date was most likely a placeholder, so they'd have time to figure things out, but they still could've done enough research into the matter to give a new estimated date. They could also just straight up say they don't know how long it'll take, just longer than initially expected, instead of no reason at all. Besides, they still have a set date for August 28th if you order it to be delivered directly to you from the Samsung store, so why is there no new set date for people picking up their orders from Best Buy? What's changed to caused the difference in dates?\n\n## Comment ID letgvd6 with +2 score by [(Suspicious-Bean0813, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/letgvd6/) (in reply to ID 1ebidoy):\nI didn't get an email, but my order was placed on hold at the samsung experience store, so I needed to cancel and re order with the buds on a second order to get the flip.

I’m afraid to even talk to a Samsung representative because they swore I would be able to pick them up from Best Buy on July 23rd and Best Buy said the same when I called them. I’ve been a Samsung user since the first Galaxy Note (I miss the Note 4 with the universal remote IR blaster), and I have preordered every single item I’ve ever had from the Note 8 to the S24U. (Trade-ins and the incentives mean I rarely pay even *half* the cost of anything, so I just keep that ball rolling.) That’s several phones, tablets, watches, and buds. I’ve never had a single issue aside from a shipper goofing my N20U delivery, and Samsung gave me a $100 credit to spend on any accessories, chargers, etc., for a mobile device. It wasn’t even their fault. Now I can’t even get a straightforward answer on anything for these. I understand that things can go wrong, sometimes catastrophically, but just give me some details, and I’m fine. I hate being in the dark like this.

I preordered just about immediately when they opened up, and JUST received the delayed shipping email from Samsung today?!?!?... 3 weeks to the day since i placed my pre-order for the buds 3 pro silver.\n\n#### Comment ID lfso4ck with +1 score by [(KSamV, Reddit, 2024-07-31)](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/lfso4ck/) (in reply to ID lfrxyua):\nHmm interesting, reason why I asked cuz I saw some people it still said preorder and mine got changed from preorder to in process\n\n## Comment ID leu0uzm with +1 score by [(1pwntrolz, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/leu0uzm/) (in reply to ID 1ebidoy):\nMine is delayed too, but isn't it better to  delayed than to receive defective items?\n\n### Comment ID leulkue with +2 score by [(Navycrew91, Reddit, 2024-07-25)](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxybuds/comments/1ebidoy/pick_up_date_changed_again_for_buds_3_pro/leulkue/) (in reply to ID leu0uzm):\nI don't mind the delay, I'm just wishing they'd give us more info on the delay.

So, for that reason, it makes perfect sense. If you're not going to save any extra, then I would agree that it could make sense to not preorder.

She starts scrabbling to prove them wrong.\n\n## Comment ID jksz1zz with +123 score by [(SnooPandas9602, Reddit, 2023-05-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SellingSunset/comments/13m04x9/s06e02_discussion_tbd_on_bre/jksz1zz/) (in reply to ID 13m04x9):\nI love that they are showing a lot more real estate this season!\n\n### Comment ID jl0lsbx with +101 score by [(HarrySpeakup, Reddit, 2023-05-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SellingSunset/comments/13m04x9/s06e02_discussion_tbd_on_bre/jl0lsbx/) (in reply to ID jksz1zz):\nAs far as I'm concerned, they could be showing one house over and over.

Some do very well, others not so much. Here is what I have been told by a realtor friend in SoCal - \n\nThe commissions presented on the show are the max. I believe Netflix is just list price * 6%. But half usually goes to the other agent.\n\nThen O group deducts the direct costs for selling the property. All the parties, ads, etc gets recouped.  Sometimes agents will cover expenses that are causing a stalemate. That gets recouped too. \n\nThen you have the brokerage cut. Which is about a third or so - 1% of the original seller side commission (3%). \n\nThen the interesting part - a lot of these listings are Jason or Brett’s clients. They don’t have enough time, and they hand them off. But Jason and Brett still keep a lot of the commission. So yah, the ladies are making .5% -1% commission. So a $10M house is $50k, not the $600K as presented. And the sometimes there are two on the listing with Jason.\n\nMy friend has told me there are agents in the suburbs selling average single family homes doing better financially than those in luxury real estate.\n\n### Comment ID jkxojz0 with +23 score by [(Cartoonexpertornot, Reddit, 2023-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SellingSunset/comments/13m04x9/s06e02_discussion_tbd_on_bre/jkxojz0/) (in reply to ID jku9wsk):\nOne them said in an interview last week that the numbers you see on the show are fake\n\n#### Comment ID jky8nzs with +25 score by [(Jane_Marie_CA, Reddit, 2023-05-20)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SellingSunset/comments/13m04x9/s06e02_discussion_tbd_on_bre/jky8nzs/) (in reply to ID jkxojz0):\nYah and not every house we see is for sale at the time of filming. \n\nThere have been a few houses over the years where I have looked it up online only to find the O Group sold it 3 years ago.

She was a new agent and needed the opportunities to build her portfolio, if she gets a chance, she’s gonna take it, no? How would it look for her as a new employee to reject opportunities given to her by her boss so she doesn’t offend Nicole?

In contrast, the variant I advocate for utilizes short-lived feature branches for pull requests before merging them frequently back into the trunk. This variant is sometimes, confusingly, equated with GitHub Flow.\n\nIf you are using branches at all, you're not using TBD, from what I've heard from advocates. They don't push every commit to trunk, but they also aren't working on a branch either, and they are supposed to be integrating multiple times per day with other code changes on trunk, not merely pulling trunk changes into their branch.\n\nSounds like the author is using GitHub Flow with a particular emphasis on very short-lived branches, but wants to call that TBD.\n\nIf that's wrong, I'd like to know the difference between the two. Surely it can't just be \"lifetime of branches\", to be called a different strategy.\n\n### Comment ID k9qdz4f with +9 score by [(BandicootGood5246, Reddit, 2023-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9qdz4f/) (in reply to ID k9p6udy):\nI think it's a purist argument to say you have to use no branches. From what I've seen short lived branches works pretty similar. \n\nMy main problem with gitflow is you're not always aiming for your code to be production ready at all times because Dev can be in weird intermediate state, and can lead to a bunch of things like gold-plating or \"it doesn't matter this isn't ready for prod it's only Dev\"\n\n#### Comment ID k9sdeeg with +2 score by [(lIIllIIlllIIllIIl, Reddit, 2023-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9sdeeg/) (in reply to ID k9qdz4f):\nAt my job, we say we do trunk-based development because all our branches are only 1-degree of separation from the main branch.

My team (myself included) just aren't good enough to merge code without someone else reviewing it. \n\nUnless they strongly follow the boyscout rule and communicate their code changes effectively with the rest of their team, I don't see it working.

I've just talked with a bunch of TBD purists who care very much. They are kind of annoying about it, especially when they insist that TBD is required for CI as well. No TBD, no CI, because it's not \"continuous\".\n\nI'm mainly asking because the author themselves made the point that what they are doing is definitely not GitHub Flow, but it actually sounds liked it is. I was hoping someone could actually point to a meaningful distinction.\n\nI also disagree with TBD advocates and their over-reliance on feature flags. I think feature flags are quite useful for several purposes, such as enabling A/B testing, releasing opt-in experimental/previews, or separating code delivery from feature launch.

If a person has the rigor to commit to trunk, their changes are already isolated until they push a set of commits. What does a branch give them? And why wouldn't this scale?\n\nIf anything, scaled TBD seems like a weird thing, because it stresses that branches are for a single developer only. Why the heck would a team want to limit itself from collaboration like that? I think it's better when multiple devs are working on a feature (or at least have the opportunity to do this), because then they are designing and testing it together live, rather than waiting for a review on the PR.

The hard part is training the team on small, consistent, commits. It’s very easy to get heads down and forget to commit. \n\nThat said, I wouldn’t say we NEVER use branches, but it is very rare. If I get pulled off to another card after partially completing work, I’ll move it onto a branch so the changes don’t get lost. The key at that point is to make sure you that when you do start work on the branch that you merge it into into trunk as soon as it’s buildable again.  Or do it immediately and keep the changes local, but if you’re sharing a machine with other devs this can get confusing. \n\nSuffice to say, I think there is a place for branches in TBD, and in some sense what OP is doing us TBD but with additional steps that I personally don’t really see the benefit of? Seems incredibly confusing to make so many tiny branches like that but 🤷‍♂️\n\n#### Comment ID k9q5m6e with +9 score by [(Mattsvaliant, Reddit, 2023-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9q5m6e/) (in reply to ID k9pqf22):\nSo how do you do PRs and code review?\n\n#### Comment ID k9qh12q with +4 score by [(goranlepuz, Reddit, 2023-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9qh12q/) (in reply to ID k9pqf22):\n(At my work, we regularly use branches).\n\n>so long as people are consistently pushing to the main trunk branch it immensely cuts back on merge conflicts!\n\nWhat also cuts it back is occasionally merging from trunk to my branch.\n\nI think this phrase is indicative of people not being sufficiently comfortable with source control.

All mainline development was on trunk. (We had customer support fixes for released products on their own branches, one per supported release, but almost all development was on trunk).\n\nIt was okay, but not amazing. I can't say I've had much issues with merge conflicts in the past, no matter what approach we were using. Developers with poor habits are going to be a problem no matter what approach is being used. A dev messing up feature flags and failing to guard their code correctly is going to be a problem as well.\n\nAlso, I think strict TBD doesn't work very well for non-cloud programs and non-web apps.\n\n#### Comment ID k9qrsms with +1 score by [(ErGo404, Reddit, 2023-11-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/17xom10/why_i_prefer_trunkbased_development/k9qrsms/) (in reply to ID k9pqf22):\nIs your main branch always in a \"releasable\" state with TBD ?\n\nIf not, how do you handle releases ?\n\nHow do you handle the development of large features ?

These are generally the cheapest controllers you can get with high levels of durability and reliability.\nASC | Arcade Style Controller | You get what you pay for, for ASCs that's a lot. This next tier features many components you will find inside the actual arcade games. They may have variance it the details, but this does the job for most people wanting the arcade experience at home.\nOAC | Official Arcade Style Controller | Arcade style controllers officially released or endorsed by the game developer.\nAAC | Arcade Accurate Controller | The most expensive tier of controller, these are 1:1 in size, components, features, and feel to their arcade counterparts.\n\n## Comment ID d0iaurw with +3 score by [(Dagam, Reddit, 2016-02-29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rhythmgames/comments/48bhgk/the_rrhythmgames_official_guide_to_simulation/d0iaurw/) (in reply to ID 48bhgk):\nPhase Shift it's a good alternative to Frets On Fire which stop developement a few years go.

They cost in the $70-$100 range, I got mine (with the U.S. PS2 game) for $80 off eBay. It's perfect for beginner and intermediate players getting into LR2, especially those that might already have a PS2-USB adapter with a dance pad like I do.\n\nStupidly, I threw mine away a few years ago when I was in the process of moving. Instantly regretted that when I found out about LR2.

See bmsplayerdata for info about support.\n* [nanasigroove2 (Toy Musical 3)](http://tm3.toymusical.net/en) - Game and music package for 9keys mode.

Originally developed by Urao Yane, but he dropped the project due to legal tension. It was later picked up by Kikuchan. It's support is very limited. It only supports base format BMS files, meaning 256 #WAV sounds or #BMP images, and only 5keys or 10keys modes. Has half lanes like old school beatmania.\n* [BM98 Drink Edition](http://www.uranus.dti.ne.jp/~kikuchan/bm98/) A mod of BM98 that makes it support 7keys and 14keys modes, and now has a skin which looks more akin to old beatmaniaIIDX styles.

But since we're not speaking strictly about Konami games, and many controllers called \"Arcade Style\" don't really come too close (Especially dance game pads), I decided to create some more specific terms.\n\nI mean, what would you call a 3rd party dance foam dance mat? It's neither a KOC or an ASC, it's an unofficial controller for home use. Cobalt Fluxes, similarly, aren't anywhere near arcade accurate, nor do they have any common design construction with arcade pads.\n\nThen, what would you call an original Red Octane guitar for Guitar Hero 2?

      "# [Sutter Health Park Effects...TBD by Nico on 2024-10-12](https://www.athleticsnation.com/2024/10/12/24268323/sutter-health-park-effects-tbd-j-p-sears-joey-estes-sacramento-river-cats-meow)\nThe presumption seems to be that the A’s are moving to a launching pad in 2025, and so long as 40% of the rotation includes JP Sears and Joey Estes I suppose HRs will not be in short supply.\n\nBut some of the notion of Sacramento as a hitter’s paradise comes from perception that does not necessarily mirror reality. Sutter is being contrasted with the pitcher friendly Oakland Coliseum, with its vast foul territory and evening marine layer. Certainly, a park with normal amounts of foul ground and no heavy fog will play more fairly for the hitters.\n\nThe other perception altering factor is the temperature. It is presumed that any climate that reaches 100 degrees will be conducive to the long ball, but Sacramento is not the Las Vegas desert nor does it feature the Denver altitude. And HRs are only one measure of offense — hot days don’t help a ball scoot through the infield or find acreage in right-center field.\n\nSome truths about Sutter Health Park: the dimensions are comparable to the Coliseum. In fact it is an identical 330 feet to straightaway LF and a few feet deeper to CF at 403 feet. RF is 5 feet shorter at 325 feet. So it is not a “band box” by any means.\n\nAlso, while summers do get over 100 degrees in Sacramento the vast majority of the games are going to be scheduled at night to offset the heat, and so game time temperatures will generally be in the 80s and falling throughout the evening.\n\nOn the flip side, if they do in fact make the horrible and irresponsible decision to install turf that will likely create more offense by way of balls scooting faster through the infield and in the outfield.\n\nPut it all together and certainly you won’t have a pitcher’s park like the A’s have played in for decades. But it’s unclear how much of a hitter’s park it will be or how much it might play “fair” or “neutral”.\n\nI guess it’s looking like the field will play “a bit the hitter-y side of neutral,” which is certainly a significant shift from what A’s fans are accustomed to. But depending on how the turf (if it’s turf) is actually designed and installed, you could conceivably have a surface that slowed down balls a touch more than natural grass, which could in turn shift the metrics radically.\n\nI guess what I’m pointing out is that in a scenario where the grass/turf surface actually favors the defense over the batter, in the 4th inning where the temperature is in the mid-70s and it’s still 325-330 to the corners and 403 to CF...we probably shouldn’t jump to assume games are going to be 9-7.\n\nI do know this: if you’re an A’s hitter who has called the Coliseum home and who has seen his batting average take the usual .010-.020 point dip from foul balls that never made it into the seats and the relentless marine layer, you might be looking forward to at least the level playing field Sacramento will offer.\n\nBut this isn’t Fenway Park with it’s “310 feet” to LF (cough under 300 cough) or Wrigley Field with the wind blowing fiercely out. If you’re a hitter, you will still have to hit the ball well and if you’re a pitcher you should have a fighting chance.\n\nOne question the A’s front office has to consider is: do they want to factor in their new home park in how they build their roster, and if so how should they tilt? This becomes a more difficult strategy when you don’t know, exactly, what to expect. And we won’t really know until the A’s play some games there — yes, the River Cats have previewed life on the field but AAA baseball just isn’t the same game as the MLB version.\n\nWe will find out in 5.5 months just how the field plays, by which time it will even have a playing surface ready to play on. Until then all we can do is conjecture, so: conjecture away. What do you expect? And how should the A’s plan for life at Sutter Health Park in order to gain a home field advantage?",

      "# [Invisible Rivers Mondo Bizarro on 2024-11-17](https://www.ringling.org/event/invisible-rivers/)\nPerformed on and near Sarasota Bay, this unique collaboration between Louisiana-based Mondo Bizarro and the Land Memory Bank & Seed Exchange combines the twin influences of art and education to involve citizen audiences in Invisible Rivers. Part procession, part performance-art talk, Invisible Rivers is a project that uses music, theater, and boatbuilding to bring their experiences from the rapidly changing coastal region of southeast Louisiana. Using a pontoon stage, the artists work with the local community hosting classes, dialogues, and performances on the “float lab” to elaborate stories of our region's interconnected struggles against coastal land loss, environmental racism, and displacement in the land we love.\n\nOur “Pay What You Wish” pricing structure allows full access to attend shows at the daringly affordable price of $0.99 per show with an option to contribute more if you wish. Your extra supports helps us make these events possible!\n\nSuggested Eco-Performance Support Levels:\n\n🎩 Eco-Blossom: $25\n\n🎩 Eco-Sapling: $15\n\n🎩 Eco-Seedling: $5\n\nThe SunHAT Eco-Performance Fest is funded in part by a grant from South Arts in partnership with the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nInvisible Rivers was made possible with funding by the New England Foundation for the Arts’ National Theater Project, with lead funding from the Mellon Foundation and additional support from the Doris Duke Foundation.",
