      "# [Home Mortgage Calculator on 2017-02-28](https://www.sofi.com/mortgage-calculator/)\nWelcome to the SoFi mortgage payment calculator. Whether you have found your dream home or are wondering what your purchase budget should be — or already own a home and are considering a refinance — this calculator will help you determine what your monthly home loan payment will be and how much interest you’ll pay over the life of your loan. Let the number crunching begin.\n\nStep 1: Enter your property value.\n\nUse the value or listed price of your desired home or the current estimated value of the home you wish to refinance.\n\nStep 2: Enter a down payment amount or percent down\n\nEnter a down payment of at least 3%. If you’re considering a mortgage refinance, enter the amount of equity you currently have in your home (subtract the amount you owe on your current mortgage from your home’s estimated current value).\n\nEnter a down payment amount and the mortgage payment calculator will give you the percentage down, and vice versa. So you could also choose to enter a percent down to see what your down payment would need to be. Putting 20% down on a property will allow you to avoid paying private mortgage insurance (PMI), but many homebuyers put down less than 20%, especially if they qualify as first-time homebuyers.\n\nIf you think you will need to borrow more than $766,550 to purchase a home, you’re likely a candidate for a jumbo loan and a lender may require you to put down at least 10%. (Some pricier areas have higher minimums for jumbo loans — enter the zip code of the location you’re shopping in at Fannie Mae’s mapping tool to see the jumbo loan number for your area.)\n\nStep 3: Enter an interest rate.\n\nPlug in the day’s average fixed rate for a 15- or 30-year mortgage, or use the rate a lender has suggested you may qualify for.\n\nStep 4: Choose a loan term.\n\nThe term is the number of years the loan will last. The lower the term, the higher the monthly payment but the greater the savings in total interest paid.\n\nUnderstanding the Results\n\nThe calculator will immediately show the following results:\n\n• Loan amount: This is the amount you would borrow, also known as the principal.\n\n• Monthly payment: This is what you would pay toward the principal and interest each month. Remember that you will also need to pay for property taxes, homeowners insurance, and perhaps homeowners association (HOA) fees and private mortgage insurance (PMI). Some of these costs will be higher or lower depending on the cost of living in your area.\n\n• Total interest paid: This is the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan.\n\n• Payoff date: Here, the mortgage loan calculator shows the day you’d pay off your mortgage unless you refinanced or paid it off early.\n\n• Amortization chart: This chart shows interest paid, principal paid, and the remaining amount of the loan with each mortgage payment. Move your cursor to the right to see how payments are amortized over time. The amortization chart can also serve as a mortgage payment calculator: As you move your cursor you can see how much money would be required to pay off the principal you owe at different times during the loan. If you do want to pay off your mortgage, get the exact amount due from your lender.\n\nBenefits of Using a Mortgage Payment Calculator\n\nMortgages can be complicated, especially if you’re buying your first home, but there are many ways a mortgage payment calculator can help. Playing with different property values can give you a general idea of how a home’s price might impact your monthly payments and what a mortgage loan may cost in total over the life of the loan.\n\nIt’s also helpful to use a home mortgage calculator to compare the monthly payment for different types of mortgage loans (15- vs. 30-year terms). And it’s useful to see how sizing up (or trimming back) your down payment amount might affect your monthly costs. (If you think you might struggle to come up with any down payment at all, there are down payment assistance programs that can help.)\n\nThe only downside of using a mortgage calculator? As noted above, many mortgage calculators don’t include property taxes, homeowners insurance, mortgage insurance, or HOA fees — so they don’t provide a complete picture of the recurring expenses on a property. And of course the numbers you get from a mortgage calculator are only as solid as the numbers you put in: If you put in a low interest rate that you can’t qualify for because of steep debts or a shaky credit history, your actual results in the mortgage market will differ.\n\nFormula for Calculating a Mortgage Payment\n\nThe mathematical formula for a home mortgage calculator is pretty complicated, which is why this calculator is so handy. If you wanted to do the math by hand, your formula would look like the one below. In this example:\n\nM = Monthly mortgage payment\n\nP = Principal (the amount you borrow)\n\nR = Your base interest rate. (Use the base rate, not the APR.) You’ll divide this by 12 because the rate is an annual one and you are solving for a monthly payment amount.\n\nN = Number of payments in your loan term. A 15-year term, for example, would have 180 monthly payments.\n\nM = P [R(1 + R)ⁿ] / [(1 + R)ⁿ − 1]²\n\nDeciding How Much House You Can Afford\n\nUsing a mortgage calculator is one way to begin to get a handle on how much house you can afford. You can also use a home affordability calculator , which will take into account your annual income and debts to generate a maximum home price that would be within your budget.\n\nThere are also longstanding guidelines for homebuyers that can help you determine what you can afford. One is the 28/36 rule, which states that your total mortgage payment, including principal, interest, taxes, and insurance, should not exceed 28% of your gross income, and your mortgage payment plus any other debt payments should not exceed 36% of your gross income. To learn what your monthly limits would be under the 28/36 rule, simply multiply your monthly gross income by 0.28 and again by 0.36.\n\nRecommended: Average Monthly Expenses for One Person\n\nHow Lenders Decide How Much You Can Afford to Borrow\n\nThere’s another important calculation involved in the homebuying process: the number-crunching a prospective lender will do to determine the size of loan and terms you might qualify for. Each lender has its own formula, but in general a lender will be looking at your debt-to-income ratio, which is your total debt divided by your total income, shown as a percentage. (Generally, lenders are looking for 43% or less.)\n\nLenders will also examine your credit history, your income history, your down payment amount, and other factors to arrive at whether you are a good candidate for a loan and, if so, what terms you’ll be offered.\n\nWhat’s Next: Get Preapproved for a Mortgage Loan\n\nOnce you’ve used a mortgage calculator to estimate how much you might be able to pay for a house, you can get prequalified for a mortgage with a few lenders to obtain a clearer idea of what interest rate and loan amount a lender might offer you, based on a high-level look at your finances. As you get serious about home-shopping, you’ll want to take the next step and get preapproved for a mortgage with at least one lender.\n\nGoing through the mortgage preapproval process involves a thorough review of your credit and financial history. If you seem to be a good candidate for a home loan, the lender will give you a letter stating that you qualify for a loan of a certain amount and at a certain interest rate. The letter is an offer, but not a firm commitment. It’s typically good for up to 90 days. If you’re competing with other buyers in a hot market, being preapproved for financing will make you more attractive to sellers.\n\nRecommended: Best Affordable Places in the U.S.\n\nComponents of a Mortgage Payment\n\nPrincipal and interest are the foundation of a mortgage payment, and the amount of your monthly payment that goes to each of these expenses changes over the life of the loan, with more of the payment being applied to interest costs early in the life of the loan. As you make payments over the years, more money will gradually go toward paying down the principal.\n\nTypical Costs Included in a Mortgage Payment\n\nPrincipal and interest aren’t the whole story. Maybe you’ve heard of PITI, which stands for principal, interest, taxes, and insurance. Property taxes and homeowners insurance costs can often be rolled into mortgage payments. The money is held in an escrow account, and payments are then made by your mortgage servicer. You can decide whether taxes and insurance become part of your monthly mortgage payment when you choose your home mortgage loan.\n\nTips on Reducing Your Mortgage Payment\n\nAfter you’ve had your home loan for a while, you might be interested in lowering your mortgage payments. One way is to apply any bonus or windfall to the principal. Another option might be to refinance to a lower interest rate. Maybe rates have dropped or your credit score has improved significantly since you bought your home — in this case, a refinance might offer real savings. You can put a lower interest rate into a mortgage payment calculator to see how a refinance would affect your monthly payments and interest paid over the life of a new loan.\n\nAnother way to reduce your monthly payment: If your equity in the home has hit 20% of its original value (the value when you purchased it), you can write to request that your lender cancel PMI. As long as the property has held its value, you have kept current on your monthly payments, and there are no liens or additional mortgages on the home, your request should be granted.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nA mortgage payment calculator can give you an idea of what your monthly mortgage payments would look like based on how much you spend on a house, what size down payment you make, and what interest rate you obtain. It’s also a good way to see how much interest you would pay over the life of a loan. Getting prequalified for a home loan with one or more lenders will give you an even clearer idea. And obtaining a mortgage preapproval will tell you exactly how much you may qualify to borrow from a lender and what your monthly payments might be.\n\nLooking for an affordable option for a home mortgage loan? SoFi can help: We offer low down payments (as little as 3% - 5%*) with our competitive and flexible home mortgage loans. Plus, applying is extra convenient: It's online, with access to one-on-one help.\n\nSoFi Mortgages: simple, smart, and so affordable.\n\nView your rate\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is a mortgage payment?\n\nA borrower makes monthly payments, typically made up of principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and any private mortgage insurance required by the lender. With a fixed-rate mortgage, monthly payments stay the same, but the amount of each payment that is put toward principal vs. interest is divvied up differently over time. A mortgage loan calculator can show what monthly payments would be based on different loan types and interest rates.\n\nHow does my credit score affect my mortgage loan interest rate?\n\nThose with the highest scores get the lowest rates. Even a small increase in rate can make a big difference over the life of a loan.\n\nWhat is principal and interest on a mortgage loan?\n\nThe principal is the amount borrowed. The interest is the price paid for borrowing.\n\nHow much should I put down on a mortgage?\n\nTwenty percent down on a conventional loan is ideal, but most people are not able to come up with that much. Some conventional and government-backed loans allow for low down payments or none at all.\n\nShould I choose a 30-year or 15-year mortgage term?\n\nIf you can comfortably swing the payments on a 15-year mortgage and you have emergency and retirement savings, the shorter loan term could be a smart choice because the total savings in interest will be substantial.\n\nHow can I get a lower mortgage interest rate?\n\nAdvertised rates are often misleading, so shoppers beware. Many house hunters ask for loan estimates from several lenders after applying for a mortgage. Be sure to examine the details and compare apples to apples. There may be room to negotiate with a chosen lender. FHA, VA, and USDA loans may have lower rates than conventional loans (but they require either mortgage insurance or fees).\n\nHow much income do you need for a $400,000 mortgage?\n\nIt would take an annual income of about $130,000 to afford a $400,000 mortgage. If you have significant debts, you might need to earn more.\n\nCan I afford a $300K house on a $70K salary?\n\nOne rule of thumb is that your home’s cost should not be more than three times your annual income. So it would be difficult to cover the costs of a $300,000 house on a $70,000 salary — unless you are able to contribute a large down payment. Use a home affordability calculator to zero in on your personal budget number.\n\nWhat is a livable hourly wage?\n\nThe living wage in the United States is $25.02 per hour, or $104,077.70 per year (before taxes) for a household of two working adults and two kids, according to 2022 analysis from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Living Wage Calculator. This is a national average, and your personal number will depend on costs in your local area and your family size.\n\nCan a single person live on $36,000 a year?\n\nA single person can live on $36,000 a year in a low-cost area of the country, but in a higher-priced region it would be difficult. In San Francisco, for example, a living wage for a single person is more than $56,000 per year, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Living Wage Calculator. In Des Moines, Iowa, however, a living wage for a single person is just under $36,000 a year.\n\nYou Might Also Like",

The industry is going through an unprecedented change, and our employees, like Content Writer/Editor Sulaiman Abdur-Rahman, are at the forefront. Sulaiman is here to share how he’s helping to drive the growth of our brand so we can fulfill our mission, all while achieving the work-life balance that allows him to bring his best self to work.\n\nBefore we get started, tell us three things that others may not know about you.\n\nSulaiman:\n\nI hold an Australian Permanent Resident visa;\n\nAt one time, I wanted to be the Anthony Bourdain of New Jersey (my place of birth);\n\nI regularly watch the soap opera General Hospital.\n\nWow, what a variety! And on top of that, you’re a writer who has spent the majority of your career as a freelancer. What made you decide to go ‘in house’?\n\nSulaiman: I’ve held full-time jobs most of my career as a professional journalist, but in my free time I would freelance to build up my experience and supplement my income. I would commit numerous hours toward work and side gigs, often burning the midnight oil. I knew I needed to make a change to provide a better work-life balance, and I’ve been blessed to have the opportunity to join an amazing team here at SoFi.\n\nWe love to hear it - and have seen a lot more research around how finding work-life balance and prioritizing your mental well-being is more important than ever. You decided to join SoFi in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. Other than looking for better work-life balance, why’d you decide to make the jump?\n\nSulaiman: I saw the global COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity for pursuing my personal and professional goals. It was a unique time where workers like myself suddenly had a renewed sense of value. There’s no reward without taking risks, and the tight labor market and so-called ‘Great Resignation’, on top of the new normal of working from home, placed me on an uncharted path that guided me to SoFi. I tell people that having the opportunity to work here in the role that I have as a Content Writer/Editor is an offer I couldn’t refuse.\n\n\"I saw the global COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity for pursuing my personal and professional goals. It was a unique time where workers like myself suddenly had a renewed sense of value.\"\n\nTell us about what you do here.\n\nSulaiman: I primarily write and edit educational SEO content for Lantern by SoFi. Providing Members with insights about personal loans, student loans, and auto loans is a major part of my job as a Content Writer/Editor, as well as enhancing our existing content and contributing ideas for growing our business and brand.\n\nHow have your freelance skills helped you excel in this role?\n\nSulaiman: I believe my freelance skills help me to quickly learn and adapt, which is essential when working for a fast-growing fintech. A big moment for us came when President Biden announced his broad student loan forgiveness plan in August 2022. My skills as an experienced journalist, accustomed to working on tight deadlines, prepared me for that day. Upon hearing the news, I produced an updated Lantern by SoFi student loan forgiveness article and made the necessary updates to other articles on our site reflecting the Dec. 31 payment pause extension.\n\nWorking in coordination with the Content Team, I’ve implemented the urgent updates using our content management system. The other priority I had that week was to draft urgent updates to the following articles: “Can You Get Student Loan Forgiveness if You Refinance?” and “Should I Refinance My Student Loans?” These efforts paid dividends: Lantern’s organic search traffic in August increased by 115% over July, and much of that boost came from a 323% increase in Lantern’s student loan organic search traffic month over month.\n\n\"I believe my freelance skills help me to quickly learn and adapt, which is essential when working for a fast-growing fintech.\"\n\nWhat has surprised you about working at SoFi?\n\nSulaiman: I was surprised by how such a quickly growing company with more than 4,000 employees in our SoFi-ety (our SoFi Society; SoFi-ety! That’s what we call our people) could create such a welcoming and unifying environment for everyone. To see the company executives, especially our CEO Anthony Noto, make themselves visible and regularly accessible while pushing this company forward, I must say that surprised me. I love the All-Hands weekly meeting, and I really feel as if we’re one big family here at SoFi.\n\nYour passion for where we are going is infectious!

      "# [Crypto 101: A Beginner's Guide to Cryptocurrency on 2023-11-16](https://www.sofi.com/crypto-guide/)\nCrypto Basics\n\nWhat Is Cryptocurrency?\n\nCryptocurrency, often simply called “crypto,” is any type of decentralized, digital currency that’s based on cryptography. Those three terms are key to understanding the thousands of different types of crypto being traded today.\n\n“Decentralized” means that cryptocurrency isn’t issued by a central authority like a government or bank, the way the dollar, euro, yen, and other fiat currencies are. Instead, cryptocurrencies are created, exchanged, and often overseen by a distributed peer-to-peer network.\n\nCrypto is digital, meaning two things. First, with a couple of exceptions, the value of most crypto is not pegged to a fiat currency like the dollar or euro, nor is it determined by a precious metal like gold. And though people may refer to crypto in physical terms (e.g., as coins), crypto is generated and traded in only a digital format.\n\nCryptography refers to the mathematical technique used to secure each unit of cryptocurrency and ensure it can’t be copied.\n\nMost crypto exists on a blockchain platform. Blockchain is the digital ledger that records most crypto transactions. This use of blockchain technology as a foundational element for cryptocurrency began in 2009, in tandem with the launch of Bitcoin. But blockchain technology is evolving rapidly, and a range of other industries are exploring its potential applications as well.\n\nHow Does Cryptocurrency Work?\n\nThere are thousands of cryptocurrencies, and while many are designed to provide some new feature or function on a given blockchain platform, many, if not most are founded on similar principles to those that established Bitcoin. Crypto is secured by a peer-to-peer network, and users can trade or transfer value — globally and almost instantly, 24 hours per day, seven days per week — without relying on a middleman, like a bank or payment processor.\n\nCryptocurrencies are considered secure because they employ a “trustless” system of verification for all transactions. This means that users don’t have to rely on a third party to verify transactions: the system itself is self-governing.\n\nAs of November 2023, estimates of the number of cryptocurrency you can trade are around 8,800, with a total market capitalization of over $1.32 trillion. The biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are Bitcoin and Ethereum – by a wide margin. Cryptocurrencies are generally stored in digital wallets, commonly a blockchain wallet, which allows users to manage and trade different crypto.\n\nWhat Is Blockchain Technology?\n\nThe widespread use of blockchain technology as the underlying platform for most forms of crypto began in 2009, when an innovative use of blockchain enabled the successful launch of Bitcoin. For that reason, many people think of blockchain and cryptocurrency as synonymous, when in fact blockchain technology has a wide variety of applications.\n\nBlockchain is a digital, append-only ledger that can be used to track or record almost any type of asset, from goods and services to patents, smart contracts, and more. It’s transparent, meaning the transactions on a public blockchain are accessible to anyone, and unlike a physical system of record keeping, the record of transactions is designed to be permanent and immutable.\n\nWhy Is It Called Blockchain?\n\nThe reason blockchain records are theoretically unchangeable is because the system is built from “blocks” of data that are “chained” together in chronological order (hence the name “blockchain”) so that all transactions are visible to everyone on the network. Blockchain technology relies on cryptography to secure these transactions and, in the case of many types of crypto, to mine coins and tokens.\n\nWhy Is Blockchain Considered Secure?\n\nA blockchain runs on a decentralized network of computers, called nodes, which enable a form of consensus (peer-to-peer) confirmation that can drive faster, more secure transactions. The distributed, self-governing nature of blockchain thus makes fraud and duplication far more difficult compared with legacy record-keeping systems.\n\nThe combination of speed, security, and transparency has not only enabled the growth of cryptocurrencies worldwide, many other industries are now exploring blockchain’s uses as well.\n\nWhat are Crypto Exchanges?\n\nWith the exception of emerging crypto-based securities, it’s generally not possible to trade crypto on a traditional exchange, which is why you need a crypto exchange.\n\nThere are three main types of crypto exchanges: centralized, decentralized, and hybrid. While centralized exchanges are still more common for trading crypto, it’s important to understand the differences among the three so you can decide which is best for you.\n\nCentralized\n\nA centralized cryptocurrency exchange is a platform where cryptos are bought and sold, with the help of a third party to conduct the transactions. On a centralized exchange you can use a traditional, aka fiat currency, like the dollar to execute trades, as well as trading crypto itself.\n\nDecentralized\n\nDecentralized exchanges (DEX) are more aligned with the spirit of crypto, in that these exchanges allow crypto investors to trade directly with each other, without the need for a middleman. In theory, a DEX might be more secure since there’s no central platform that can be hacked. Also, without the need for third parties, you might see lower fees and faster transaction speeds on a DEX.\n\nHybrid\n\nHybrid exchanges are less common than either centralized or decentralized exchanges. They aim to combine features of both: e.g., the liquidity of a centralized exchange and the security and anonymity of a DEX.\n\nWhen choosing the exchange where you prefer to trade crypto, there are other issues to consider, including ease of use, whether your funds might be insured, as well as other considerations.\n\nBitcoin and Beyond\n\nBitcoin: The OG Crypto\n\nBitcoin (BTC) was the first cryptocurrency to be created in 2009 by a person (or possibly a group) using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was designed to be independent of any government or central bank. Instead it relies on blockchain technology, a decentralized public ledger that contains a digital record of every Bitcoin transaction.\n\nIn essence, Bitcoin established the basic system of cryptography and consensus (i.e., peer-to-peer) verification that is the foundation of most forms of crypto today.\n\nBitcoin History\n\nIn 2008, an individual or group of individuals going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, published a paper called, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” It was not the first case ever made for a digital currency — there were many attempts in the decades prior — but this was perhaps the first to propose a “trustless” system of electronic transactions that would depend on a peer-to-peer system of verification via blockchain technology. This innovative approach also solved a persistent problem with digital currencies, the so-called double-spending problem — or the risk that digital currencies could be hacked and spent more than once.\n\nThanks to the research detailed in this paper, the first Bitcoins were created in January 2009, and the Bitcoin mining system was established. But the number of BTC in the market is capped. While there are more than 18.8 million Bitcoin tokens in circulation as of November 2021, worth over $1 trillion, the total limit is 21 million BTC.\n\nHow Bitcoin Works\n\nBitcoin miners use powerful computers to verify blocks of transactions and generate more Bitcoins — a complex, time-consuming process called proof-of-work (PoW). Each block of transactions is logged permanently on the blockchain, which helps to validate and secure each Bitcoin and the network as a whole. Owing to the vast number of computers or nodes on the Bitcoin blockchain, the PoW process ends up using so much energy that many people question whether it’s sustainable, as noted.\n\nHow To Get Bitcoin\n\nThThere are a few different ways to buy Bitcoin.\n\n• Exchanges. As noted above, you can trade crypto — including Bitcoin — on centralized, decentralized, or hybrid exchanges. All you need is a crypto wallet for storing your Bitcoins.\n\n• ATMs. There are many crypto ATMs scattered around the country where you can purchase Bitcoin. Unlike a traditional ATM, though, you can’t withdraw actual cash from these machines; they make digital only transactions via the blockchain.\n\n• Brokerages. A growing number of brokers now allow you to buy and sell crypto, similar to any other security, including SoFi Invest®.\n\nPros and Cons of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin may be the oldest and most popular form of crypto (by market share), but it has its pros and cons.\n\n• Market capitalization. The crypto-verse comprises thousands of coins and tokens, but Bitcoin is the biggest of them all, with a market cap of more than $675 billion, as of November 2023. For context: Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap, is around $225 billion.\n\n• Volatility. Bitcoin is extremely volatile. Even within the course of a single day, the value can fluctuate by thousands. And on a broader scale, between January and November 2023, Bitcoin’s value was as high as $35,000, and as low as $16,000.\n\n• Not SIPC insured. Most investors are insured by the SIPC up to $500,000 if a brokerage fails (or funds are stolen). But the SIPC doesn’t cover crypto.\n\n• Regulation and usage. The inconsistency of regulations governing crypto has likely limited the use of these currencies around the world. That said, a number of companies do accept Bitcoin as payment — just do your research first.",

      "# [Cost of Living in Utah (2024) by SoFi on 2021-12-10](https://www.sofi.com/cost-living-utah/)\n(Last Updated – 03/2023)\n\nIf you visit Utah you may notice a lot of people with smiles on their faces. Utah is the fourth happiest state in the country, according to a 2022 study by WalletHub, which took factors like economic, emotional, physical, and social health into consideration when ranking all U.S. states.\n\nIf you want to get in on some of that happiness, a move to Utah may be in order. To get a better idea if a move to the Beehive State is the right fit for your finances, keep reading to learn more about the Utah cost of living. That way you can keep your budget happy too.\n\nWhat’s the Average Cost of Living in Utah?\n\nAverage Cost of Living in Utah: $42,653 per year\n\nBefore you make any decisions about where to put down roots, you might want to take your monthly budget into consideration.\n\nThinking about moving to Utah? Get ready to tap your savings or earn quite a bit, as Utah has the 30th lowest cost of living across the United States, according to MERIC’s 2022 Cost of Living Index data gathered in 2022.\n\nIf Utah is out of your price range, you can consider making a move to Wyoming, which is in the same region but ranks 16th for states with the lowest cost of living.\n\nHow much does it cost to live in Utah? According to 2021 data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis , the average total personal consumption cost in Utah is $42,653 annually. Let’s take a closer look at that spending:\n\nCategory\n\nAverage Annual Per-Capita Cost in Utah\n\nHousing and Utilities\n\n$7,278\n\nHealth Care\n\n$5,735\n\nFood and Beverages (non-restaurant)\n\n$3,112\n\nGas and Energy Goods\n\n$1,162\n\nAll Other Personal Expenditures\n\n$25,367\n\nLooked at as average monthly expenses, that’s $3,554.\n\nHousing Costs in Utah\n\nAverage Housing Costs in Utah: $946 to $1,840 per month\n\nHousing in Utah can be expensive, but it can also be on the affordable side. How much you’ll spend depends on what type of living arrangements you choose. With more than 1.19 million housing units, according to 2021 census data, you’ll have plenty of options to choose from.\n\nUtah’s typical home value was $500,077 in February 2023, according to Zillow, but this is what you can expect to spend monthly if owning or renting, the 2021 census data shows.\n\n• Median monthly mortgage cost: $1,682\n\n• Median studio rent: $946\n\n• Median one-bedroom rent: $976\n\n• Median two-bedroom rent: $1,167\n\n• Median three-bedroom rent: $1,380\n\n• Median four-bedroom rent: $1,697\n\n• Median five-bedroom (or more) rent: $1,840\n\n• Median gross rent: $1,208\n\nWhere you live in Utah can play a major role in how much you spend on housing. These are the typical home values for a handful of major Utah cities, according to Zillow, in January 2023.\n\nUtah City\n\nTypical Home Price\n\nSalt Lake City\n\n$523,590\n\nOgden\n\n$467,276\n\nProvo\n\n$519,413\n\nSt. George\n\n$506,107\n\nLogan\n\n$423,557\n\nHeber\n\n$807,444\n\nCedar City\n\n$397,241\n\nVernal\n\n$273,115\n\nPrice\n\n$235,522\n\nUtility Costs in Utah\n\nAverage Utility Costs in Utah: $271 per month\n\nHow much should you budget for utilities every month if you plan to live in Utah? Here’s what the average monthly utility costs look like.\n\nUtility\n\nAverage Utah Bill\n\nElectricity\n\n$81\n\nGas\n\n$52\n\nCable & Internet\n\n$97\n\nWater\n\n$41\n\nSources: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Electric Sales, Revenue, and Average Price, 2021; Inspirecleanenergy.com; DoxoInsights, U.S. Cable & Internet Market Size and Household Spending Report 2022; and Rentcafe.com, What Is the Average Water Bill?\n\nGroceries & Food\n\nAverage Grocery & Food Costs in Utah: $259 per person, per month\n\nHow much you spend on food each month can vary depending on where you live. The Bureau of Economic Analysis found that Utah’s average annual (non-restaurant) food cost per person is $3,112, which equates to about $259 a month.\n\nThe Council for Community and Economic Research , which ranks the food costs in American cities, ranked Utah major cities’ grocery costs for the second quarter of 2022 (shown from lowest to highest).\n\nUtah City\n\nGrocery Items Index\n\nOgden\n\n96.5\n\nCedar City\n\n99.2\n\nProvo-Orem\n\n100.5\n\nSalt Lake City\n\n104.0\n\nTransportation\n\nAverage Transportation Costs in Utah: $5,316 to $15,073 per year\n\nFrom weekend ski trips to more mundane weekday commutes, transportation expenses add up. To get a clearer idea of how much you’d spend on transportation in Utah, take a look at the following annual estimates from MIT’s Living Wage Calculator , based on data from the first quarter of 2023.\n\nRecommended: 7 Ways to Save Money on Commuting to Work\n\nFamily Makeup\n\nAverage Annual Transportation Cost\n\nOne adult, no children\n\n$5,316\n\nTwo working adults, no children\n\n$9,561\n\nTwo working adults, three children\n\n$15,073\n\nHealth Care\n\nAverage Health Care Costs in Utah: $5,735 per person, per year\n\nThe average annual per-capita cost of health care in Utah comes out to $5,735, according to estimates from the 2021 Bureau of Economic Analysis Personal Consumption Expenditures by State report.\n\nWhat you’ll actually spend on health care will depend on your specific care needs and coverage.\n\nChild Care\n\nAverage Child Care Costs in Utah: $786 to $1,381 per child, per month\n\nMany parents struggle to make room for child care costs. Utah residents who need help covering the costs can look into state child care assistance programs .\n\nTo get a better understanding of how much you’d need to spend on child care in Utah, these are the average costs in that state, per 2021 data from costofchildcare.org .\n\nType of Child Care\n\nAverage Cost Per Month, Per Child\n\nInfant Classroom\n\n$1,381\n\nToddler Classroom\n\n$1,003\n\nPreschooler Classroom\n\n$794\n\nHome-based Family Child Care\n\n$786\n\nTaxes\n\nTax Rate in Utah: 4.85%\n\nUtah residents pay a flat-rate state income tax of 4.85%, according to the Tax Foundation’s State Individual Income Tax Rates and Brackets for 2023 .\n\nThat’s fairly low when you consider the fact that not too far away, Californians are paying as much as 13.3% in a graduated-rate state income tax system. That said, a change in plans and a move to Nevada will result in you not having to pay any state income tax at all.\n\nMiscellaneous Costs\n\nAfter you pay all of your bills, it’s time to kick back and relax. What does it cost to pass the time in Utah? According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, personal expenditures come out to $25,367 per person, per year.\n\nThese fun outings may be where some of that money is going (costs are accurate as of March 2023):\n\n• A family-friendly educational day at the Natural History Museum of Utah in Salt Lake City: $0 to $19.95, depending on age.\n\n• More family fun at the Hogle Zoo, also in Salt Lake City: $0 to $23.95, depending on age and season.\n\n• Exploring Zion National Park: $35 per vehicle for seven days."

I was with Chime. I didn’t have any major issues but did run into tiny then multiple concerns invalid options disputes became a regular occurrence sending money and delivery  service payments. Thus causing negative impact or negative account balances. Without Chime to Chime sending money was an issue especially if your expecting transactions delivered immediately. Personal checks would take 5-10 business days if your sender didn’t have Chime. Could not update to Joint Bank Accounts.

I have actually shifted to use them as my primary banking and taxable brokerage investing. There isn’t much wrong with Sofi as an app with a WHOLE LOT of benefit. Great HYSA rates, easy way to track and transfer money etc.\n\nHere is where I would like to see improvements however. Relay (their money tracking functionality) is great but I wish there were better ability to customize how things are tracked. Most importantly bank transfers from my BofA account to Sofi read as expenses since I have my BofA hooked up via plad.\nThere are a host of transactions like this that make the tracking functionality weak. It will look like I have 7k expenses per month just because of money transfers. The only way to resolve is manually going into each transaction and marking it as a transfer / exclude. This defeats the purpose I could do that in excel at that point.\n\nI wish they would focus more resources into those tracking features and net worth tracker, as well as build in more granularity into the invest features would be nice to use Sofi to execute short term trades but currently it’s not there yet",

My reason being is because you can not go into any branch and withdraw any large amount of cash even with a bank teller. Sofi bank teller withdraw cash limit is only $150.00 dollars and $1,000.00 dollars with the ATM, that makes no sense. Then Zelle’s transfer limit is $1,000.00 dollars as well. With that being said, when I tried to buy a $15,000 dollars car IN CASH, this bank prevented me from doing so that the seller ended up selling it to someone else for the delay SOFI caused because I couldn’t take out the cash or Zelle it due to the slavery limits this bank has. So my next and final option was a simple money transfer, guess how that went? Well when I tried to transfer money, SOFI CANCELED the wire transfer and said it can only be done if you are buying a home 😂. So if you want your own money to be limited, and I mean limited, then this is your bank. Plus this bank has no branches that you can walk in for help. Sure the 2 day early pay is nice, but the money hostage is not worth it. I’m going back to US Bank, no hassle at all. *Update, so there still has been no update or change of limit on SOFI account, I came back to US bank and man, am I glad I did. If you need to make a large withdrawal from a bank, or make a large transfer, DO NOT GET THIS BANK. You’ll save yourself a hassle. Other than that, if this bank is working for you then great. 👍",

Their banking side of the business does not communicate with their investment side. It was set up like this on purpose. Nikki in the investment/brokerage explained to me that they have layers built in on purpose. So if you are using both the bank and brokerage when you call one they can’t see the others systems. I spent 10 days on the phone to get a issues resolved with them and never got to actually talk to someone who could help fix the problem. They use a 3rd party to transfer money between the bank and brokerage and can’t see what happens with that company either. I believe it is Apex. Absolutely do not ever bank or invest with sofi.

And second of all I waited for my money to pend into my account after 7 days of my money being deposited into SoFi, I wanted to withdraw it back to my bank which it could not let me. So I traded Amazon and sold it right after hoping to be able to withdraw my money since SoFi didn’t receive any money on my brokerage to withdraw for whatever reason. Still won’t work so I call support and she says it’s cause I made a stock trade and now I have to wait 5 days until I can get MINE MONEY, for as I asked her alright than why couldn’t I have withdraw my money before as I tired and she still have no clue or understanding.

Since when do we need permission to delete our account including if we changed our mind and it’s empty cause it wouldn’t give us what we were looking for? In cases like this it makes you thankful for the branches you can go to because the lack of support with the technology glitches are lame.",

SoFi Plus should be available to all customers, not just those with direct deposit. Some customers may want to \"test drive\" the bank before fully committing by changing their direct deposit information. Offering those benefits upfront would be a better way to win over customers, but it seems SoFi has other priorities.\n\nRight now, it seems to be working.

Personal checks would take 5-10 business days if your sender didn’t have Chime. Could not update to Joint Bank Accounts. Sofi offers 10x more than Chime plus they actually assist you in any transaction, department or offer discounts upon lack of processing options. This Bank will be #1 Online Banking Services within next year! Guarantee!!!\nSuper Happy 😀💵💰",

After it went through, on my pay day, I called to get it disputed and they said it would take 10 business days for me to get my money back and to add insult to injury they want me to provide information to screenshots as proof of the scam in order for it to help my case. Never in my life had I heard of a bank that does business this way with its customers! I banked with Chase before this and anytime I was unfortunately scammed, all I had to do was call and dispute it and was able to get the money back the same day!!

EFT the balance payment on my account from the SAME account the loan is paid from. Payment set up on Tuesday, taken Tuesday afternoon from my bank, balance shows ZERO but they essentially FROZE the card and will NOT release the credit limit for 1.5 WEEKS AFTER they have taken the money from my account. Good thing it’s paid off and I now will switch auto payments for Apple and others to a different card. This card is TRASH and will never use it again.

Great HYSA rates, easy way to track and transfer money etc.\n\nHere is where I would like to see improvements however. Relay (their money tracking functionality) is great but I wish there were better ability to customize how things are tracked. Most importantly bank transfers from my BofA account to Sofi read as expenses since I have my BofA hooked up via plad.\nThere are a host of transactions like this that make the tracking functionality weak. It will look like I have 7k expenses per month just because of money transfers. The only way to resolve is manually going into each transaction and marking it as a transfer / exclude. This defeats the purpose I could do that in excel at that point.\n\nI wish they would focus more resources into those tracking features and net worth tracker, as well as build in more granularity into the invest features would be nice to use Sofi to execute short term trades but currently it’s not there yet",

With that being said, when I tried to buy a $15,000 dollars car IN CASH, this bank prevented me from doing so that the seller ended up selling it to someone else for the delay SOFI caused because I couldn’t take out the cash or Zelle it due to the slavery limits this bank has. So my next and final option was a simple money transfer, guess how that went? Well when I tried to transfer money, SOFI CANCELED the wire transfer and said it can only be done if you are buying a home 😂. So if you want your own money to be limited, and I mean limited, then this is your bank. Plus this bank has no branches that you can walk in for help. Sure the 2 day early pay is nice, but the money hostage is not worth it. I’m going back to US Bank, no hassle at all. *Update, so there still has been no update or change of limit on SOFI account, I came back to US bank and man, am I glad I did. If you need to make a large withdrawal from a bank, or make a large transfer, DO NOT GET THIS BANK. You’ll save yourself a hassle. Other than that, if this bank is working for you then great. 👍",

I’ve used many banks and watched and participated in the transition to online banking over the years. I can say without a doubt SOFI is the best bank I’ve ever used and I’ve used them all over the years. Completely blows away the Wells Fargo’s, Chase, Bank of America etc etc. The SOFI app itself is definitely the best one out there. Banking with SOFI is easy and for once actually makes me money. No fees and only profit! My only wish is this bank would have been around 20 years ago as I’d have a lot more money today if they did.

I spent 10 days on the phone to get a issues resolved with them and never got to actually talk to someone who could help fix the problem. They use a 3rd party to transfer money between the bank and brokerage and can’t see what happens with that company either. I believe it is Apex. Absolutely do not ever bank or invest with sofi.

I also have their credit card and utilize the relay service offered.\n\nIn 2 years I haven't had any major issues with them. \n\nPros:\n- Interest rate is competitive (I utilize a money market for a little more long term money, the cash in savings at SoFi is emergency funds).\n\n- Paycheck via direct deposit always on time (2 days early but sometimes was early as 6 days).\n\n- Customer service was super helpful for placing a long-term alert (traveling overseas for a few months). With that, received a few notifications to ensure it was me making the transaction, which is fine. Card worked in multiple countries with no issues minus the occasional fraud check stated. \n\n- Vaults is a solid idea. I like being able to visualize and setup with each paycheck to move amounts for items. I have it set for travel, insurance and taxes.\n\n- Relay is nice to put all my accounts together in one place to see my net worth.\n\n- I enjoyed the 1 year 3% cash back on the credit card, 2% after the promo. I use the SoFi card as our default fall back for anything that doesnt have a higher reward with another card.\n\nEDIT: - The Overdraft protection to pull from savings to checking is nice for auto payments. I keep all money in the savings to maximize interest.\n\n- Rewards are super easy to redeem and clearly spells out how much you will get and gives you options. I had no issues racking up a years worth (wanted to see how much we actually accumulated) and then requested a credit toward the credit card. Posted in 2 days against the card and reduced that month's auto payment amount.  \n\nCons:\n- the investment section is coming along but still well behind on options and features of bigger investment firms. The 2% IRA bonus is nice right now but compare rates of their funds if you are looking long term. \n\n- No physical branch. Obvious one but if you needed a cashier's check, you would need to wait. I'd suggest a local credit union for cash deposits and any in person needs. \n\n- Credit card payments take a day or two to reflect the balance removed from my SoFi bank account. Kind of annoying but I can live with it. \n\n- Personal checks take 4-5 days for funds to be available. Not a huge deal for me but I know some enjoy the instant availability other banks offer. \n\nOverall, it's been simple and easing using their services. As long as that system continues for me, I'll continue to use SoFi.\n\n### Comment ID l7j93kj with +1 score by [(Shot_Net_2457, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/l7j93kj/) (in reply to ID khdpanj):\nHey you \nIt’s been a while I hope you see this.

I still use a checking account from a bank with a local in-person branch.\n\nI keep 90% of my funds in the HYSA, and run nearly all my spending through credit cards. Most of my direct deposit goes to SoFi with a small portion to the \"big bank\" checking account. All my bills and credit card payments come straight out of the SoFi HYSA account.\n\nThis has worked out well for nearly a year, I get the benefit of the good APR on most of my money and it works out because SoFi allows unlimited transfers. Pretty much ideal scenario from my POV.\n\n\n\n### Comment ID khebtto with +1 score by [(Resident-Ad-408, Reddit, 2024-01-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/khebtto/) (in reply to ID khdy515):\nWell it would suck if they didn’t do unlimited transfers seeing how they don’t have any branches 😂\n\nI do a similar setup although I’m moving my direct deposit to SoFi to have it all contained in one area for day to day finances. I like their vault system so I don’t have to actively track allocations of savings myself. \n\nI use Amex Gold and a Hilton honors card for my daily expenses and pass my bills through my Amex Platinum so I steadily gain points as I go about life.

There's nothing \\*wrong\\* with USAA's banking platform - solid bank, but not much in incentives to stay there. Interest rate sucks (like it does with most brick & mortars), no great features, etc.\n\nI checked Ally and then heard about SoFi. Overall, I was more impressed with SoFi's features vs. Ally. The big feature that made me switch was NOT the APY (which I think was 4% at the time) - it was their Vaults feature (Ally has something similar called \"Buckets\".)\n\nBasically, it lets you create sub-accounts inside of your savings account called Vaults. This lets you earmark your cash for a specific goal or purpose. I've wanted a feature like this for close to a decade. \n\nVaults, along with some slight modifications to my financial decisions, suddenly made managing my money significantly easier than it's ever been. \n\nBecause Vaults are inside the Savings account, they also qualify for the higher APY as well.\n\nIf you have overdraft protection, you need to keep money in your actual savings account, because it will not automatically pull money out of any of your Vaults to cover an overdraft. You can transfer money between any of your SoFi Checking, Savings or Vaults instantly, so it's quick and easy to use.\n\nYou also have a feature called Autopilot, which can automatically transfer money from an incoming direct deposit, and auto send to the account or Vault of your choice. Makes it very easy to save money towards goals without having to think about it.\n\nI've been extremely happy with their service and have been with them now for a little over half a year.\n\n## Comment ID khhx8ol with +3 score by [(Kravos76, Reddit, 2024-01-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/khhx8ol/) (in reply to ID 1944r8o):\nMy usage of this service was purely to store a profit from a home sale and let it sit for the high yield savings benefit (along with direct deposit of 200/mo) from my employer. \nFast forward to purchasing a new home many months later and needing to wire transfer from SoFi to the title company…\n\nCaution:  if you need to do any wire transfers  - NOT AN ACH - but a real wire transfer; it’s not easy.

They’re similar in almost every way with a few exceptions. Sofi has a higher APY with 4.6% and Capital One is at 4.35%. Sofi has vaults and CO allows you to open up to 20 different savings accounts which is pretty much the same thing. You can invest through Sofi but not CO. Sofi allows you to track other bills and accounts with different banks CO doesn’t. SoFi requires direct deposit to get the higher APY but it’s not a requirement for CO. Things like cashier checks, Venmo and making big purchases like a big down payment for a car are just easier with CO. I’m not sure if these are available with Sofi yet. Both are fee free banking and anything that Sofi falls short on can be covered by Capital One. I suggest using both.

I put over $1000 er month in direct deposit to take advantage of all features including overdraft. You can literally direct deposit ANY amount to get 4.6% but you’ll need $1000 or more for overdraft. How do I use overdraft? I keep ZERO in checking and ANY amount that draws from checking gets pulled from savings. I love the 2% credit card. I love the points from the various activities. I love the vaults. I named a vault truck payment and my paid off truck payment amount automatically dumps in there when my deposit hits and earns the same 4.6%. I have a couple investments in SoFi invest simply to try it out. Transfer times are very quick and my amount limit to transfer is insanely high. Although I don’t know the exact number. ATM fees are zero when you use AllPoint ATM locations which you can find on the app. The only thing I will not do is mobile deposit because I have heard negative things have happened to people. I keep a local credit union to deposit any cash. I always recommend a local fee free bank in addition.

OK, say I put $60K into a savings account. At 4.6% APY, at the end of a calendar year I should have earned $2760 in interest made. If I divide that sum by 12, it amounts to $230 a month. Beginning after the first month after opening my account (my $60K's been in the savings account for 1 month already) would my $60,000 be up to $60,0230. And if I withdraw the $230 (move it over to checking), could I continue to do that every month? This of course assumes that the At 4.6% APY remains the same (SoFi says it's been stable for 2 years)\n\nI have contacted them directly and am waiting on a clear answer, but if anyone has real world experience regarding my subject, I'd love to hear it.\n\nThank You!\n\n## Comment ID khezrc3 with +1 score by [(Nuclear-Fat-Man, Reddit, 2024-01-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/khezrc3/) (in reply to ID 1944r8o):\nLook into Wealthfront, I use them and they’re great.

We do offer the option to add a bank account manually. It's not required to use Plaid. You can click the \"Don't see your bank\" icon. From there, you should be able to select \"Add an account manually.\" \n\nYou will be asked to enter your bank account information and confirm with two microtransactions. Please note that depending on multiple factors like account activity and tenure, this feature may not be available immediately. Please let us know if you have any questions.\n\n### Comment ID jj1aime with +1 score by [(Goofology, Reddit, 2023-05-06)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/yubr0b/transferring_money_between_sofi_another_external/jj1aime/) (in reply to ID iwe98j7):\nIs this still the case?\n\n## Comment ID iw8xj1r with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2022-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/yubr0b/transferring_money_between_sofi_another_external/iw8xj1r/) (in reply to ID yubr0b):\nUsing Cash App is an easy and fast route to move funds to any external bank\n\n### Comment ID iw8z6yh with +2 score by [(shut-up_legs, Reddit, 2022-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/yubr0b/transferring_money_between_sofi_another_external/iw8z6yh/) (in reply to ID iw8xj1r):\nthanks for the input.

Plaid is preferred, I think they allow greater same day funds availability. But you can add up to 2-3 accounts manually (I forget if it’s 2 or 3 manual links) (manual being account /RTN). To link an account manually, allow the plaid box to open and type “manually” - select cancel when your bank doesn’t come up. Follow the prompts to link an account manually. For me, sofi didn’t allow manual linking when the account was brand new.\n\nNote: please review the plaid privacy policy. They suck up ALL data from linked bank accounts. You can manage your data with the (relatively new) plaid portal.\n\n### Comment ID j7ojrg4 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/yubr0b/transferring_money_between_sofi_another_external/j7ojrg4/) (in reply to ID iwc9b7j):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID j7rexxp with +1 score by [(JV701, Reddit, 2023-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/yubr0b/transferring_money_between_sofi_another_external/j7rexxp/) (in reply to ID j7ojrg4):\nI think maybe I had to have a direct deposit coming in - which I started right away upon opening the account.

I need to do a transfer ASAP so any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n**ETA:** I meant to include that my debit card hasn't arrived in the mail yet. This is the whole reason for my question lol. However, I *have* activated & connected my virtual debit card to Google Pay in the meantime. \n\nAnyhow, whatever type of transfer we do, it can't require my physical debit card's details since I don't have that info yet. 🙃 TIA for any help!!\n\n\n\n## Comment ID jturvsi with +11 score by [(Mqxi, Reddit, 2023-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/15c7obm/best_way_to_instantly_transfer_from_sofi_acct_to/jturvsi/) (in reply to ID 15c7obm):\nPay > Pay a Friend\n\n### Comment ID jtuuh4f with +3 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-07-28)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/15c7obm/best_way_to_instantly_transfer_from_sofi_acct_to/jtuuh4f/) (in reply to ID jturvsi):\nThis is the correct answer if you're both on Sofi.

The “improvements” that were always “just around the corner” either never came or were too little and too late. Get the fraud managers out of the SOP process completely and hire an independent, experienced fraud investigator and/or education specialist to make the SOPs.

Completely unrealistic production standards that can only be met by sacrificing quality which costs millions of dollars and allows for ID theft. I regularly had to make calls that I knew were bad because we weren’t allowed time to properly do research. The company wouldn’t even pay for a backup IP search tool and we were stuck using whatever we could find on the internet. In the last year, SoFi seemed to be moving backwards in terms of progress and job quality. Not forwards. RTO, removal of development opportunities, lower raises, downsizing, etc all makes the company seem less like a FinTech and more like it was trying to be a bank. Which it didn’t know how to do yet.",

The behind-the-scenes is pretty underwhelming. \n\nOutdated and lacking tools - A lot of the work I was doing was done in excel while at other, small, less established companies I had investment into tools to help me be more efficient. \n\nLittle to no opportunities for growth.\n\nNo 401k match.",

You will always be just another number to them no matter how much they throw around and showcase their values. Prime example is the recent layoffs that happened. No warning and no real empathy given. The leader on the zoom was reading a script and they cut off access within minutes without any management reach out. \n\nTraining -Complete mess and have trainers who have not even done the actual job they are training on. So if you like being thrown it to fully do your job with a fraction of the knowledge needed to do it. This would be for you. \nThis company used to care but unfortunately you are just a number. \n\nThe other reviews about management are spot on.",

Regardless of what their code of conduct says, they will and they have allowed workplace bullying/harassment. In my experience I had a C suite leader belittle me and be demeaning throughout my tenure. Multiple times I had witnesses, and on more than 1 occasion they spoke to HR to place a complaint about his behavior. I also placed several complaints myself with my business partner. The feedback was always the same, he’s being coached. The behavior got so bad that it reached employee relations. Regardless of my evidence and witness accounts, the employee relations person stated: “I believe everything you’ve shared with me within the last 3 weeks. I am aware that this employee does have this history”. She even went and shared her own personal experience about this C suite leader. Yet, she concluded the investigation by stating that bullying isn’t illegal, and therefore they can’t do anything, and any disciplinary action cannot be shared. In an effort to protect myself, I recorded this conversation and also 5 team meetings/1-1’s with my Manager. I figured if HR wasn’t going to protect me, I needed to have this evidence for reference. He never took accountability for his actions, if anything, the investigation made things worse and I had to go back and share evidence of retaliation. The poor behavior by this leader was documented and witnessed by people team employees and across other departments. Yet nothing was ever done. The abuse continued. I’m no longer with SoFi. Yet, I will always remember how unfair I was treated and the hostile work environment brought on by this leader.\n\n“Facts do not seize to exist because they’re ignored.”",

While we are glad you enjoyed the people and benefits and felt your compensation was adequate, we are disappointed to hear you didn't experience a good work-life balance, as we strive to provide an environment that supports this. We are continually working to improve our processes and provide resources to help employees manage their work effectively and efficiently. As you know, one of our core values at SoFi is \"Take Care of People and Help Them Grow,\" so we appreciate you sharing that you would have preferred a different on-call rotation. We hope you shared your concerns with your manager or PBP during your time here. We have grown a lot over the last few years, partly because of the acquisitions we have made, which we believe were the right decisions to ensure SoFi's continued success. Like many companies over the past year, we have not been immune to small reductions in our workforce - these extremely difficult decisions are not taken lightly. If you would like to continue the conversation, I welcome an email to glassdoor@sofi.org. Best of luck in your next career endeavors.",

We have ambitious goals of becoming a top 10 financial institution, but we feel we will still be able to maintain the special sauce that makes SoFi, SoFi.  As you may remember, late last year, we announced our companywide RTO approach focused on flexibility. We do not currently have any plans to change our RTO policy.

Ultimately I was pushed out of the organization after a very long career of being an overachiever in every other place I’ve worked.

The company wouldn’t even pay for a backup IP search tool and we were stuck using whatever we could find on the internet.

Multiple times I had witnesses, and on more than 1 occasion they spoke to HR to place a complaint about his behavior. I also placed several complaints myself with my business partner. The feedback was always the same, he’s being coached. The behavior got so bad that it reached employee relations. Regardless of my evidence and witness accounts, the employee relations person stated: “I believe everything you’ve shared with me within the last 3 weeks. I am aware that this employee does have this history”. She even went and shared her own personal experience about this C suite leader. Yet, she concluded the investigation by stating that bullying isn’t illegal, and therefore they can’t do anything, and any disciplinary action cannot be shared. In an effort to protect myself, I recorded this conversation and also 5 team meetings/1-1’s with my Manager. I figured if HR wasn’t going to protect me, I needed to have this evidence for reference. He never took accountability for his actions, if anything, the investigation made things worse and I had to go back and share evidence of retaliation. The poor behavior by this leader was documented and witnessed by people team employees and across other departments. Yet nothing was ever done. The abuse continued. I’m no longer with SoFi. Yet, I will always remember how unfair I was treated and the hostile work environment brought on by this leader.\n\n“Facts do not seize to exist because they’re ignored.”",

      "# [SoFi Blog: Tips and News— for Your Financial Moves](https://www.sofi.com/blog/)\nWe closed out 2023 on a high note by debuting SoFi’s first comprehensive ESG report which captured our efforts throughout 2022. Today, we’re proud to share that our ESG Committee, which is made up of 10 SoFi stakeholders who represent key areas of our organization–including facilities, people, financial reporting, and others – has finalized our second annual ESG report. The 2023 ESG Report, tracks our progress across environmental, social, and governance programs while also collaborating to devise and execute strategies for future impact.\n\nThe report aims to provide stakeholders from across the SoFi community – from members, to investors, partners, and others – with a data-driven look at our stance on ESG matters today, while also providing a baseline that will be key to tracking progress over time. Programs reviewed include initiatives driven by our People team (e.g., benefits, diversity, equity and inclusion, compensation, our approach to talent and employee development, etc.) – as well as our product development processes, community investments and social impact, our environmental footprint, corporate governance strategies, risk management operations, public policy initiatives, and more.\n\nWe are excited to share the 2023 report with you today and continue to bring each of you along with us as we enter the next chapter in our endeavor to foster a better tomorrow.\n\nContact Information: For general inquiries about SoFi’s ESG strategy or upcoming report, please reach out to [email protected], and for investor-specific questions, [email protected].\n\nRead more\n\nWe’re thrilled to share some exciting news: SoFi has been named on Forbes’ Best Workplaces for Women! A true testament to our commitment to fostering an inclusive, supportive, and empowering environment for all employees, this recognition is especially meaningful to me, not just as SoFi’s Chief People Officer – but on a personal level, too.\n\nThis recognition, conducted annually by Forbes in partnership with market research firm Statista, celebrates the top 400 companies in the nation that excel in creating equitable environments for women in the workforce. This exciting acknowledgment is a testament to our ongoing efforts at SoFi to empower women and cultivate a culture that’s dedicated to the success, growth, and overall well-being of everyone. In other words: the best part of my job at SoFi!\n\nBut the reason I feel particularly proud of this is not just about my current role at SoFi. As a woman who’s spent 20+ years working in tech, finance, and healthcare, I am genuinely proud of the collective “us.” In addition to the progress we’ve made at SoFi, I’m deeply inspired by how far the broader workforce has come since I started my career, which is right around the same time I started my journey as a mom. This intersection of life milestones – though not easy at the time – has truly fueled my ambition to give all that I can as a mom while also bringing my best self to work each day.\n\nIn addition to reflecting on my own journey, today’s recognition from Forbes gave me a chance to reflect on the ways we’ve evolved – and are continuing to evolve – at SoFi to be part of the solution. Here are a couple of recent highlights that stood out to me and helped us secure a place on the coveted list:\n\nEmployee Resource Groups\n\nSoFi proudly sponsors nine Employee Resource Groups, known internally as SoFi Circles. These groups build high-trust, functional connections that help our organization thrive. They also foster a sense of belonging, drive innovation and help create bridges of connection and intersectionality. The SoFi Circles and their defined missions and while all employees are encouraged to join any Circle they feel aligned to, we see our female employees engaging most with two in particular:\n\n• Women@SoFi— Mission is to build a safe space for female-identifying employees and allies to connect across SoFi to promote the advancement and inclusion of women. We’re looking forward to taking this engagement to an even deeper level in the coming months as we plan to offer smaller group sessions – based on various levels within the organization to create space for meaningful conversations at specific levels (e.g. senior leaders, people managers, etc.).\n\n• Parents@SoFi— the mission of Parents@SoFi is to support current and future parents at SoFi. This is something I would’ve loved to have had access to when I was starting my journey as a working mom, which is part of the reason I stepped into the role of executive sponsor for this group which aims to create an environment where people with shared experiences can connect and help each other have both a successful career at SoFi and a rewarding family life.\n\nFace of Finance\n\nIn addition to building internal programs to support women, we’ve dedicated resources to external initiatives that aim to empower all women, as well. Our Face of Finance campaign was launched in an effort to bring attention to AI bias and present a new narrative around women’s financial successes. Our talented in-house team created a video revealing the bias that exists in current algorithms and successfully recast women in a more accurate light, depicting the image of wealth and fiscal responsibility that so many women work so hard to achieve. But our video was just the beginning. We enlisted the help of some of social media’s most influential women to help us retrain AI by using their images, so that it could better reflect the truth about women and money. In addition to having a positive external impact – with more than 81M impressions and a 42% surge in unaided awareness – the Face of Finance video also served as an excellent source of engagement internally as well, bringing employees together around a concept we all feel passionate about.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs I look to the future – both as a SoFi leader and a woman in the workforce – I know the best is yet to come. I’m looking forward to continuing to work with our team to bring solutions that empower women – and all employees – to collaborate across our organization in a way that allows them to unlock their potential and offers both clarity and purpose in the work they do everyday.\n\nRead more",

SOFI TUKKER will chat about bread, the beloved food staple, and the chemistry that makes it so delicious with Maria Ortiz — the food scientist behind the popular Instagram account All You Knead is Bread — on Sunday, Sept. 22 at 4:30 p.m.\n\nHosted by Emory’s Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, the event — which is free and open to the public — also features live music, local food vendors, children’s programming and exhibits. Festival registration is open.\n\nSOFI TUKKER joins the previously announced keynote speaker, renowned rapper, producer and record executive Jermaine Dupri, and more than 40 other speakers at the festival, intended to connect students and the greater community with visionary scholars, creators and thought leaders, including a Pulitzer-winning journalist, transformative business executive, New York Times-bestselling music historian and innovative toy designer.\n\nDuring the festival’s keynote session Friday evening, Dupri, a Grammy Award winner, Atlanta native and founder of So So Def Recordings, will engage in conversation with Whyte and Joycelyn Wilson, assistant professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at Georgia Tech. Through her work as an ethnographer, Wilson has traced the cultural forces that have shaped Atlanta’s unique identity as the thriving epicenter of hip hop and R&B.\n\nDelving into multiple themes\n\nAdditional speaker sessions on Saturday and Sunday will cover an array of themes including science, history, literature, entrepreneurship, music and cinematography and photography. The full schedule and speaker biographies are now available on the newly launched Ideas Festival Emory website.\n\nJust a few of the notable speakers include:\n\nBarbara Kopple, a two-time Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker;\n\nVirginia Willis, a James Beard award-winning cookbook author and chef;\n\nJon Goode, an Emmy-nominated writer whose work has been featured on CNN, HBO and BET;\n\nStephanie Stuckey, board chair of Stuckey’s, the candy manufacturer; and\n\nCarrie Buse, head of design for Mattel’s Future Lab, which focuses on innovative products and play experiences.\n\nThroughout the weekend, Ideas Festival Emory will feature live music and entertainment on the Oxford College quad, photography exhibits and food and drink vendors.\n\nThe event will also include children’s programming and collaborations with local schools. In partnership with the Newton Education Foundation, the Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement will host hundreds of students from Newton County Schools, providing them with a unique learning opportunity to connect with children’s book authors.\n\nThe festival has attracted sponsors committed to engaging individuals and families across the metro Atlanta region in its programming, including Lumina Foundation, WABE, the City of Covington and Rough Draft Atlanta.\n\nKen Carter, Charles Howard Candler Professor of Psychology and founding director of the Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, believes the festival — the center’s flagship event — will be distinctive in its mission to share ideas and spark curiosity with local and global audiences.\n\n“Ideas Festival Emory is a celebration of creativity and innovation, connecting the public with visionary leaders who inspire and challenge us,” says Carter. “We hope the festival will ignite new ideas and inspire meaningful conversations, in an environment that will be fun for people of all ages.”\n\nWhile attendees will engage with and learn from speakers during the sessions, Carter hopes the festival will have an impact that stretches beyond the three-day event. Speaker sessions will be recorded for an upcoming podcast that will help extend the festival's reach and attract curious listeners from around the world.\n\nThe Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, established in 2023, aims to help faculty and students proactively engage in public conversation and increase confidence in the value of scholarship and evidence-based research. With plans to expand its programming and host a Public Scholarship Academy for faculty in May 2025, the center — housed at Oxford College — hopes to establish itself as a novel space where scholars share knowledge and insights directly with the community.\n\n“I’m proud that Oxford College is home to the Emory Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, and we look forward to hosting this incredible weekend of exploration and discovery on our beautiful campus,” says Oxford Dean Badia Ahad.\n\n“Bringing together a diversity of scholars, artists and writers to discuss some of the most pressing and complex issues of our time is particularly important in this cultural moment when we need more and better models of civil discourse, free expression of ideas and constructive dialogue,” Ahad continues. “This perfectly captures the spirit of education and collaboration we embrace here at Oxford and Emory.”",
      "# [This Apple News Could Change Your Life by Keith Wagstaff on 2024-09-20](https://www.sofi.com/article/money-life/this-apple-news-could-change-your-life/)\nThe new iPhone 16 models hit stores today, but there’s some other Apple (AAPL) news that might impact you more.\n\nMonths after the filing of an antitrust case in the U.S., the company announced it’s opening the technology that powers Apple Pay to outside developers. That might not sound as exciting as a fancy new phone feature, but it could have serious repercussions for the tech industry – and consumers worldwide.\n\nThe Rise of NFC Payments\n\nApple Pay launched in 2014 and is now accepted at 85% of retailers across the U.S., according to the company. It runs on NFC (near-field communication) technology, which also powers Google Pay from Alphabet (GOOGL) and Samsung Pay.\n\nThe technology uses a radio frequency meant for communication at close ranges. Place a phone with NFC payments enabled near a compatible terminal and voila! You’ve just paid for coffee without taking out cash or a credit card.\n\nMore than half of U.S. consumers (51%) use contactless payments, according to CNBC, citing a survey from MasterCard. During the pandemic, Americans were less keen on handling cash and cards, leading to a spike in the use of NFC payments.\n\nApple Pay has become very popular. But other apps weren’t able to use the product unless it was through Apple Wallet, which meant giving Apple a 0.15% cut of every transaction. That led to new EU regulations and an antitrust case in the U.S. Now, things are changing.\n\nFuture of NFC\n\nApple announced it’s giving third-party developers access to Apple Pay, meaning apps will be able to use the technology on iPhones without sacrificing a percentage of each financial transaction.\n\nThat could incentivize companies to embrace NFC in a whole new way, said The Verge. In the future, your favorite bank, retail store, airline, coffee chain, or other business might offer customers the ability to pay, use discounts, and collect rewards points directly through their apps. Or the technology could allow you to share files more easily or scan a virtual badge to walk into work.\n\nOf course, developers just got access to the technology, so don’t expect new NFC features from your favorite iOS apps anytime soon. When they do arrive, customers might finally feel more comfortable leaving their physical wallets at home.\n\nCheck it out\n\nPlease understand that this information provided is general in nature and shouldn’t be construed as a recommendation or solicitation of any products offered by SoFi’s affiliates and subsidiaries.

      "# [Week Ahead on Wall Street: Emergency Cut? by Mario Ismailanji on 2024-08-12](https://www.sofi.com/article/market-news/week-ahead-on-wall-street-emergency-cut/)\nNot When, But How Many\n\nPeople may be in the thick of their summer vacations, but there’s no such thing as time off for financial markets. Last week was a prime example of that and judging by what’s on the calendar for this week, we’re likely to get another such reminder.\n\nSeveral economic indicators will be updated, with each having the potential to make or break how investors think about the macroeconomic backdrop. Inflation releases (producer and consumer prices) will be particularly scrutinized, as they’ll help inform the path of interest rates. Lower than expected inflation reports could increase rate cut expectations, while hotter prints could have the opposite effect.\n\nThe Fed isn’t due to meet again until September, but some investors have brought up the possibility of an emergency inter-meeting rate cut. While such a thing is certainly possible, it has historically been rare and reserved for periods of sudden economic deterioration or financial market instability. Proponents of an emergency cut argue that the weak July jobs report and last week’s market volatility fit the criteria, but Claudia Sahm, economist, former Fed insider, and the creator of the Sahm Rule, as well as SoFi’s very own Liz Young Thomas disagree and think an emergency cut is not only unlikely but would even be counterproductive.\n\nInstead of debating the timing of the first interest rate cut – September seems almost guaranteed at this point – a more interesting discussion is the magnitude of the cut and how many more will follow. Market pricing currently indicates a more than 50% chance that the central bank will cut by 50bps in September – more than the standard 25bp increment – followed by additional cuts in November, December, and beyond. So as economic data comes out this week, investors won’t be thinking about when cuts are coming. They’ll be thinking about how many are ahead.\n\nEconomic and Earnings Calendar\n\nMonday\n\n• July New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations: This is a measure of peoples’ expectations for inflation, jobs prospects, earnings growth, and more.\n\n• July Treasury Statement: This summarizes the U.S. federal government budget by tracking government revenues and expenditures.\n\nTuesday\n\n• July NFIB Small Business Optimism: This measures how small business owners feel about current and future economic conditions.\n\n• July Producer Price Index: The PPI tracks price trends that producers face and is down significantly from its peak earlier in the cycle.\n\n• Fedspeak: Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic will discuss the economic outlook in a moderated conversation.\n\n• Earnings: Home Depot (HD)\n\nWednesday\n\n• July Consumer Price Index: The CPI is one of the most popular indicators for tracking consumer price trends and is a marquee release for market watchers. CPI has come down notably from its peak in 2022 but remains somewhat above pre-pandemic levels.\n\n• Weekly Mortgage Applications: Mortgage activity gives insight on demand conditions in the housing market.\n\n• Earnings: Cardinal Health (CAH), Cisco (CSCO)\n\nThursday\n\n• August Empire State Manufacturing Activity: The New York Fed’s survey of manufacturing executives in the region on business conditions and their outlook.\n\n• July Retail Sales: This measures spending at retail stores and is a key indicator of consumer demand.\n\n• August Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Activity: The Philadelphia Fed’s survey of manufacturing executives in the region on business conditions and their outlook.\n\n• July Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization: The industrial sector accounts for much of the cyclical swings in economic activity.\n\n• August NAHB Housing Market Index: This index tracks how homebuilders feel about the current and future state of the single-family housing market.\n\n• Weekly Jobless Claims: This high frequency labor market data gives insight into filings for unemployment benefits.

I hadn’t had a dog since I was a child and really had no interest. It was a lot of work, I thought, and when you’re depressed – as I was – that’s the last thing you want in your life.\n\nMy 13-year-old daughter, Annie, knew better, though. We – I – needed a dog. “Let’s just go and look at these eight-week-old snowball puppies,” she said. “We don’t have to take one – just look.”\n\nThose “snowball puppies” turned out to be American eskimos – the kind of dog they had rolling on balls in circuses. Sofi was the runt of the litter, a ball of white fur you could not see in the snow. Annie said she would take care of her. Good intentions, I’m sure – but we both knew this would be my dog in the long run.\n\nIn the years to come, I would learn why people have such an affinity with dogs. They don’t offer you anything tangible, serve up great conversations or make your life easier. No, they’re your connection with the universe.\n\nSofi single-handedly lifted me out of my depression, accomplishing what therapists, family and friends could not by absorbing how I felt and letting me know it was OK to feel those things. When I was uptight, she was tense. When I was sad, she stared at me quietly – for as long as it took to comfort me. At those times she would not leave my side unless someone took her away. Her amazing presence represented all the mysterious strength the universe had at its disposal. I had never experienced anything like it, and I doubt I ever will again.\n\nShe still found time to be silly. She would leap high in the air to snatch a stick from your hand, and even higher to snag a Frisbee out of the air. She spent her summers playing dangerous games with bees and, despite her thick coat, lying baking in the sun and hiking with us. And nothing compared with the pure natural beauty of watching her sprint down a beach or across a field. She spread her goodwill to everyone she met, unless you were wearing a hat.\n\nShe was 14 when a routine checkup revealed that she didn’t have long to live. Time to say goodbye so she would not suffer. For the next two weeks we basked in her company and spoiled her silly. Years of memories flooded by, the funny and incredible experiences, and all of the lives Sofi had affected positively. I felt I was dealing with it stoically. Until that day came.\n\nThe veterinarian apologised as Sofi needed a third needle to make the drugs work. Sofi wasn’t having any of it. She didn’t want to leave me alone, to leave me behind. She refused to even lie down. She looked at me and said she was going nowhere, at least for a few more minutes. To Sofi it had never been about being my dog. From day one it had been her task to watch over me. An act of grace.",

(August 13, 2024) – TGL presented by SoFi, the new team golf league backed by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy’s TMRW Sports, announced Toptracer as the Official Ball-Tracing Partner of TGL presented by SoFi. TGL consists of six teams of PGA TOUR superstars competing in a progressive, fast-paced form of team golf within the custom-built SoFi Center, a 250,000 square foot venue on the campus of Palm Beach State College in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. The league’s inaugural season launches Tuesday, Jan. 7 in prime time on ESPN and ESPN+ in the U.S. Today’s announcement was made by Scott Blevins, General Manager, Toptracer, and Andrew Macaulay, Chief Technology Officer, TMRW Sports and TGL presented by SoFi.\n\nToptracer’s ball-tracing capabilities are a central part of TGL’s technology mix, which incorporates Toptracer’s camera sensors to track ball flights on tee and approach shots taken into TGL’s massive screen and accurately extrapolate the remaining trajectory of each shot. TGL’s tee boxes are set 35 and 20 yards from the screen, which is 64x53 feet and nearly 24 times larger than a standard simulator screen. All of Toptracer’s data will be fed into TGL’s data engine, providing viewers and second-screen users a depth of insights, learnings, and predictive data on every shot.\n\n“We’ve been relentlessly collaborating with TGL over the past two years on how to deliver the best fan experience, with all our learnings from broadcasting golf’s biggest moments, our 1,000+ strong network of golf facility operators across the globe—including Topgolf, the biggest off course operator—and golf governing partners,” said Blevins. “As leaders in modern golf, we’re excited to be part of this groundbreaking format and deliver a new way for fans to be engaged with the sport.”\n\n“For two years, TGL presented by SoFi has been working with Toptracer’s technology team to refine how we accurately merge live action and virtual technology. With the flexibility, accuracy, and reliability of Toptracer’s ball-tracing technology, we’re gathering an extensive amount of data on each shot to help accurately transition into the virtual landscapes of our custom-designed holes,” said Macaulay. “Using Toptracer’s ball-tracing has added to the scale of TGL, allowing for our tee boxes to be a long way from the screen and for shots to be hit from any lie and location.”\n\nToptracer is the No. 1 range technology in golf, integrated into more than 1,000 driving range facilities around the world—including Topgolf venues—and provides broadcast TV ball-tracing technology for all of golf’s major tournaments.

He said city officials worked with festival organizers between Saturday and Sunday to find ways of alleviating the problem, which primarily focused on certain \"bass frequencies.\"\n\n\"These frequencies can be affected by stage position, reflection off of buildings and atmospheric conditions including wind,\" Bass wrote in a statement. \"City authorities engaged the event promoter and the venue and implemented several critical adjustments to each stage and established enhanced monitoring plans for overall sound and bass levels. Additional sound engineers were strategically positioned in areas of concern from Saturday afternoon through Sunday and were promptly dispatched to make necessary adjustments in real time.\n\n\"As a result, a significant decrease in call volume was observed on Sunday in the initially impacted areas,\" he said. \"However, some areas continued to experience bass vibrations. Moving forward, and with the lessons learned the past weekend, we are prepared to better monitor and supervise future event organizers to minimize the sound and vibration impact on the community outside the venue.\"\n\nThe Hard Summer festival featured four outdoor music stages positioned outside SoFi Stadium, located mainly in the surrounding parking lots.",

      "# [SoFi Connection getting closer by GumbyDammet on 2023-12-29](https://community.quicken.com/discussion/7944565/sofi-connection-getting-closer)\nI try to connect my Quicken to my SoFi accounts every once in a while and I've gotten some success today. It appears as though the checking and saving accounts are downloading transactions with a few twists and turns.\n\nWith my first attempt, I linked all of my accounts and only got transactions for my checking account. It loaded a long history of transactions which matched to a lot of the reconciled transactions in my register along with a lot of old transactions that did not match. One thing I did notice is that it screws up the opening balance when it downloads so make sure you check it before you connect your account. I deleted all of the old, downloaded transactions that were reconciled but didn't match and accepted the rest.\n\nSince I only got the checking account transactions, I deactivated the connections for my savings account and vaults and tried connecting them again. This time I got the savings transactions but nothing for the vaults. Repeated the process used for checking to get the savings account reconciled.\n\nFinally, I deactivated the connections to my vaults and tried connecting them but did not get any transactions for any of my vaults.\n\nThe great news is that it looks like we are finally going to be able to download our SoFi transactions into Quicken for Windows. The bad news is that it is not quite there yet. I'll post an update in a few days to see if I get new transactions.\n\nInteresting.\n\nI am new to Sofi over the last 2 weeks. Since setting up Savings/Checking/CC, I was able to set-up all accounts in Quicken with the \"Add Account\" and searching Sofi. It found all three and has been downloading new transactions on them all for the past 2 weeks as I've transferred money in and made some initial purchases on the CC.\n\nYesterday I created 2 vaults… today I saw the transactions come in via the savings account (one for a balance of the vault and another showing the transfer from the Savings into the vault. I then hit \"add account\" again, and sure enough the two vaults showed up as additional accounts to add into Quicken.\n\nAt least for me… everything is working as I would expect from any other institution. I saw that multiple people have had issues over the past few months, but so far its been smooth for me."
