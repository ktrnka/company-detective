Enter SoFi, the all-in-one banking app that allows consumers to save, spend, borrow, earn, invest and protect their money.\n\nThe brand is encouraging the public to drop their financial institutions with their fun “Break Up With Bad Banking” campaign — and shelling out several chances to win prizes at the same time!\n\nOne opportunity includes taking part in a three-day TikTok challenge where participants can share their break up stories using a catchy tune made in partnership with @JaxWritesSongs and using the hashtag #SoFiBreakUpChallenge. Several celebrities — including Porsha Williams, Karamo Brown and rapper 24kGoldn — are already on board!\n\nThroughout the campaign, SoFi will reward people with $75,000 in SoFi Reward Points and the grand prize winner will be awarded $25,000 in rewards points at the end of the contest.\n\nBecause that’s not enough, SoFi is also offering up another opportunity to cash in during Super Bowl LVI on Sunday, February 13. Throughout the big game, SoFi will host a Twitter conversation calling on members to #MoveOnWithSoFi and provide prompts via social media giving away up to $25,000 in prizes.\n\n“Sometimes we stay in relationships that don’t fulfill us even though we know it’s time to break up,” Lauren Stafford Webb, Chief Marketing Officer of SoFi, says. “Our new ‘Break Up with Bad Banking’ campaign is a call to action for consumers to wake up from financial complacency and join a bank that truly understands their wants and needs.”\n\nThe exec adds: “We are committed to creating meaningful and lasting relationships with our members.

No issues though I havent used customer service yet. I have checks and vaults. I accidently overdrew my checking and it auto-pulled from savings (which was nice feature I didnt even know about as I was trying to keep low checking balance). APY applies to all the accounts/vaults. It does track your spending and home value and car value too if you want that, though I find its hard to find where this is on the app. If you do direct deposit from certain payors you get paid 2 days earlier (Wed instead of Friday). Sync to Monarch has been without any issue or hiccup since day one and the transactions come over pretty quickly.\n\n### Comment ID lxmytmk with +2 score by [(Youknowit2btrue, Reddit, 2024-11-17)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1gsd7ix/officially_migrating_to_sofi_anything_i_should/lxmytmk/) (in reply to ID lxhw7xi):\nThe auto pull from savings is a nice feature I use all the time.

Generally all the deposits and bank transfers are quick. The app is nice, but it does incentivize you to take out debt with all their other products. When you are Plus the extra interest and reward points are great. \n\nIf you get their credit card, they do not do CLI on them. So you are stuck with whatever the introductory offer is. Support isn’t bad, but they haven’t always solved my problem. Right now I have a transaction on my credit card that will not clear. I have called the vendor and bank. Both say the money is cleared but the hold will not go away. It’s almost been a month now. As I mentioned they just flat out tell me no they are not doing CLI on the credit cards on phone calls or in chat. \n\nThe Invest worked fine. I was able to transfer funds, buy stocks and things worked well. \n\nI can’t articulate my exact reasons for leaving, just something in my gut that says to go. I’ve read posts about fees starting to pop up for things like account inactivity, robo advisors, etc. i haven’t looked at their balance sheet lately, but they need to keep showing growth.

I think it is a little more intuitive than Fidelity for example. I only invested in VOO while I was using it so I can’t provide feedback on any complex portfolio management. Doesn’t sound like you’d be doing that either. \n\nI moved to Fidelity largely because of how much assets they manage over SoFi. I don’t think either is right or wrong when you are starting out. Your behavior and savings rate is far more important. \n\nThe only thing to remember is to get access to Plus you do need to have direct deposits going to SoFi. In a multi-\naccount structure you may have to move money around. \n\nWhat I personally did was used SoFi for everything and had a credit union for cash and check deposits. (I read a story where someone deposited a check with SoFi and they froze all their money and it scared me). I previously had multiple accounts and played to much mental math that has me spending more than I realized. That is what is leading to the simplification of my finances. I might not get as high of a return on my cash in a credit union, but the simplicity and returns on a money market account (through Fidelity) are worth the peace for me.\n\n## Comment ID lxdh6o8 with +2 score by [(Retire_Trade_3007, Reddit, 2024-11-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1gsd7ix/officially_migrating_to_sofi_anything_i_should/lxdh6o8/) (in reply to ID 1gsd7ix):\nLeave money in savings and turn on all the overdraft settings.

I also have their credit card and utilize the relay service offered.\n\nIn 2 years I haven't had any major issues with them. \n\nPros:\n- Interest rate is competitive (I utilize a money market for a little more long term money, the cash in savings at SoFi is emergency funds).\n\n- Paycheck via direct deposit always on time (2 days early but sometimes was early as 6 days).\n\n- Customer service was super helpful for placing a long-term alert (traveling overseas for a few months). With that, received a few notifications to ensure it was me making the transaction, which is fine. Card worked in multiple countries with no issues minus the occasional fraud check stated. \n\n- Vaults is a solid idea. I like being able to visualize and setup with each paycheck to move amounts for items. I have it set for travel, insurance and taxes.\n\n- Relay is nice to put all my accounts together in one place to see my net worth.\n\n- I enjoyed the 1 year 3% cash back on the credit card, 2% after the promo. I use the SoFi card as our default fall back for anything that doesnt have a higher reward with another card.\n\nEDIT: - The Overdraft protection to pull from savings to checking is nice for auto payments. I keep all money in the savings to maximize interest.\n\n- Rewards are super easy to redeem and clearly spells out how much you will get and gives you options. I had no issues racking up a years worth (wanted to see how much we actually accumulated) and then requested a credit toward the credit card. Posted in 2 days against the card and reduced that month's auto payment amount.  \n\nCons:\n- the investment section is coming along but still well behind on options and features of bigger investment firms. The 2% IRA bonus is nice right now but compare rates of their funds if you are looking long term. \n\n- No physical branch. Obvious one but if you needed a cashier's check, you would need to wait. I'd suggest a local credit union for cash deposits and any in person needs. \n\n- Credit card payments take a day or two to reflect the balance removed from my SoFi bank account. Kind of annoying but I can live with it. \n\n- Personal checks take 4-5 days for funds to be available. Not a huge deal for me but I know some enjoy the instant availability other banks offer. \n\nOverall, it's been simple and easing using their services. As long as that system continues for me, I'll continue to use SoFi.\n\n### Comment ID l7j93kj with +1 score by [(Shot_Net_2457, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/l7j93kj/) (in reply to ID khdpanj):\nHey you \nIt’s been a while I hope you see this.

There's nothing \\*wrong\\* with USAA's banking platform - solid bank, but not much in incentives to stay there. Interest rate sucks (like it does with most brick & mortars), no great features, etc.\n\nI checked Ally and then heard about SoFi. Overall, I was more impressed with SoFi's features vs. Ally. The big feature that made me switch was NOT the APY (which I think was 4% at the time) - it was their Vaults feature (Ally has something similar called \"Buckets\".)\n\nBasically, it lets you create sub-accounts inside of your savings account called Vaults. This lets you earmark your cash for a specific goal or purpose. I've wanted a feature like this for close to a decade. \n\nVaults, along with some slight modifications to my financial decisions, suddenly made managing my money significantly easier than it's ever been. \n\nBecause Vaults are inside the Savings account, they also qualify for the higher APY as well.\n\nIf you have overdraft protection, you need to keep money in your actual savings account, because it will not automatically pull money out of any of your Vaults to cover an overdraft. You can transfer money between any of your SoFi Checking, Savings or Vaults instantly, so it's quick and easy to use.\n\nYou also have a feature called Autopilot, which can automatically transfer money from an incoming direct deposit, and auto send to the account or Vault of your choice. Makes it very easy to save money towards goals without having to think about it.\n\nI've been extremely happy with their service and have been with them now for a little over half a year.\n\n## Comment ID khhx8ol with +3 score by [(Kravos76, Reddit, 2024-01-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/khhx8ol/) (in reply to ID 1944r8o):\nMy usage of this service was purely to store a profit from a home sale and let it sit for the high yield savings benefit (along with direct deposit of 200/mo) from my employer. \nFast forward to purchasing a new home many months later and needing to wire transfer from SoFi to the title company…\n\nCaution:  if you need to do any wire transfers  - NOT AN ACH - but a real wire transfer; it’s not easy.

They’re similar in almost every way with a few exceptions. Sofi has a higher APY with 4.6% and Capital One is at 4.35%. Sofi has vaults and CO allows you to open up to 20 different savings accounts which is pretty much the same thing. You can invest through Sofi but not CO. Sofi allows you to track other bills and accounts with different banks CO doesn’t. SoFi requires direct deposit to get the higher APY but it’s not a requirement for CO. Things like cashier checks, Venmo and making big purchases like a big down payment for a car are just easier with CO. I’m not sure if these are available with Sofi yet. Both are fee free banking and anything that Sofi falls short on can be covered by Capital One. I suggest using both.

I put over $1000 er month in direct deposit to take advantage of all features including overdraft. You can literally direct deposit ANY amount to get 4.6% but you’ll need $1000 or more for overdraft. How do I use overdraft? I keep ZERO in checking and ANY amount that draws from checking gets pulled from savings. I love the 2% credit card. I love the points from the various activities. I love the vaults. I named a vault truck payment and my paid off truck payment amount automatically dumps in there when my deposit hits and earns the same 4.6%. I have a couple investments in SoFi invest simply to try it out. Transfer times are very quick and my amount limit to transfer is insanely high. Although I don’t know the exact number. ATM fees are zero when you use AllPoint ATM locations which you can find on the app. The only thing I will not do is mobile deposit because I have heard negative things have happened to people. I keep a local credit union to deposit any cash. I always recommend a local fee free bank in addition.

OK, say I put $60K into a savings account. At 4.6% APY, at the end of a calendar year I should have earned $2760 in interest made. If I divide that sum by 12, it amounts to $230 a month. Beginning after the first month after opening my account (my $60K's been in the savings account for 1 month already) would my $60,000 be up to $60,0230. And if I withdraw the $230 (move it over to checking), could I continue to do that every month? This of course assumes that the At 4.6% APY remains the same (SoFi says it's been stable for 2 years)\n\nI have contacted them directly and am waiting on a clear answer, but if anyone has real world experience regarding my subject, I'd love to hear it.\n\nThank You!\n\n## Comment ID khezrc3 with +1 score by [(Nuclear-Fat-Man, Reddit, 2024-01-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/khezrc3/) (in reply to ID 1944r8o):\nLook into Wealthfront, I use them and they’re great.

I've also had zero issues with their customer service - the few times I've actually needed to use it. They've always been professional, friendly and helpful. \n\nOne feature I always wanted (that I didn't know anyone offered until I started checking other banks out) is a \"sub account\" in the savings account - similar to SoFi's Vaults or Ally's Buckets. USAA doesn't offer it, and it seems like such a no-brainer of a feature to have - set aside money for different goals in the same account - see the total, but also see that your money is split up for different things - massive win for me.\n\nI've come to realize that as much as I like USAA for all their services, they're just falling behind. I would have never considered switching away from them for car insurance - been with them 23 years on my own policy, and before that with my parents. \n\nBut I see SoFi offers car insurance too, so hey, may as well get a quote, if nothing else. See if they really can beat a company I've had almost a 25 year history with.\n\nI'm keeping my USAA credit card - don't want to lose over a decade of history. Doesn't have great cash back, but it IS good for when I travel internationally. No FTF, good travel benefits like accident insurance, trip cancellation and a couple of other perks.\n\nBack to SoFi - I've been reading a lot of reviews, watching a lot of Youtube reviews...the only thing I think I \\*don't\\* know at this point - do they actually offer checks with the checking account? None of the Youtube reviews have mentioned it one way or another. I know we don't use checks much anymore, but I'd kind of like to at least have a book or two of them just in case.\n\nAbout to go check out their website, and probably sign up either tonight or in the morning.\n\n### Comment ID jqhxydt with +6 score by [(rebel_dean, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/14owun8/goodbye_usaa_hello_sofi/jqhxydt/) (in reply to ID jqh7wr6):\nSoFi has free checks.

My understand is: for plain set up (account username and password), if you have anything change (password change) or some website change, ACH transfer may not work, you may need to set up plain again. While routing number and account number setup is reliable for long term.\n\nBut you can use Plain to link external account to Relay Insight, it is for viewing external account balance/activities, not for ACH transfer. This has nothing to do with ACH transfer.\n\nFor ACH transfer, you will need to add it as external account, either by routing number/account number or by plain.

Plaid is preferred, I think they allow greater same day funds availability. But you can add up to 2-3 accounts manually (I forget if it’s 2 or 3 manual links) (manual being account /RTN). To link an account manually, allow the plaid box to open and type “manually” - select cancel when your bank doesn’t come up. Follow the prompts to link an account manually.

Thanks for dropping by our sub for the first time. I'm happy to step in here and help.\r  \n\r  \nLet's first walk through the steps of how to add an account in Full View®. Please follow these steps after logging into Fidelity.com:\r  \n\r  \n1. Click \"Accounts & Trade\" and then \"Full View®\"\r  \n2. On the \"Full View®\" home page, click \"Organizer\" above the welcome message\r  \n3. From the \"Organizer\" page, click \"Accounts\" on the left side and click the blue \"Add Accounts\" button in the top right\r  \n4. Select \"I have an online login to this account\" to begin the search. You may have to try a few different keyword searches. If you find the proper connection, click it to start the connecting process.\r  \n\r  \nIf you do not see the correct institution available when attempting to connect an account, the alternative would be to add the card manually. To do so, go back to the \"Add Accounts\" page, but this time click \"I don't have an online login to this account.\" Follow the account set-up to complete the process.\r  \n\r  \nIf you decide to go this path, please know that your manual accounts must be updated by you. To perform a manual account update, use these steps:\r  \n\r  \n1. Starting on the \"Home\" page of Full View®, identify the manual account and click on it\r  \n2. On the \"Account\" page, click the \"Edit\" button\r  \n3. Make the appropriate changes, then click the blue \"Save\" button when finished\r  \n\r  \nYou can read more about linking a bank to Full View® by checking out the link below. \r  \n\r  \n[Full View®](https://www.fidelity.com/what-we-offer/planning)\r  \n\r  \nIf we can help with anything else, please let us know.

I use the Personal Capital tool for net worth tracking, and the amount that you hold in the SoFi vault is hidden when it reports your balance.  I have no idea why.  I end up making a separate entry   \n\n\nAlly Bank's savings account also has a vault system, but they call it buckets, there.  Currently, the account earns 0.5% interest.  Unfortunately, their checking accounts don't have the vault system and it's only 0.1% interest; however, moving money between checking and savings is pretty seamless, and you can turn on reserve management/overdraft protection if needed.     \n\n\nPlus, I like that you can automatically schedule transactions more easily than you can with SoFi, and, if you schedule transactions or deposits, you can direct that money directly into specific buckets.   Interest works differently, though, because you designate a single bucket (or Core Savings) to receive the interest you accrue.  \n\n\nTo be honest, I have accounts with both SoFi and Ally.  I use SoFi as my main account since I prefer their investment platform, and I use Ally as a secondary for emergency funds.  I've found that I have an easier time linking Ally with some other accounts more easily than SoFi, and I have not been able to use Zelle with SoFi.\n\n## Comment ID hud5l17 with +1 score by [(itsjustmd, Reddit, 2022-01-26)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/sdec61/alternative_banks_with_vaults/hud5l17/) (in reply to ID sdec61):\nI mean it's really not any more complicated lol.

Newcomer here thinking about opening a checking/saving account. I currently have an Apple Saving account (with Apple Card). I also have a traditional brick and mortar bank account. It's satisfactory. But a few things I like about SoFi is:\n\n1. Higher APY \\~4.30% for Saving and 1.20% for Checking.\n2. Platform agnostic, unlike Apple Savings/Apple Card.\n3. All in one banking solution.\n4. Can cash out through ATMs unlike with the Apple Savings account. \n\nMy main concerns are: how good is the fraud protection? Have you had any instances where it became a headache to resolve these issues? Is having no physical locations a non-issue? And finally - Is it a good solution for someone looking for a combined HYSA and HYCA without having to have multiple accounts with different banks? \n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n\n## Comment ID jr93pe2 with +15 score by [(Neuromancer2112, Reddit, 2023-07-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/14uruq3/would_you_all_recommend_i_open_up_a_sofi_bank/jr93pe2/) (in reply to ID 14uruq3):\nI'm still a new member myself, still need to get my direct deposit set up, hopefully on Monday.\n\nI've been with USAA for around 13 years - great bank, but never really progressive in terms of adding modern features. I'd been looking at other banks for the past month or so, and finally decided on SoFi.\n\nMy big reason was NOT the generous savings account APY (although it's certainly nice to have), but rather the Vaults feature - you have a savings account, and you can have up to 20 \"sub accounts\" (Vaults) within it, to be able to track money for specific goals. There's no need to open a bunch of different savings accounts, or worse - leaving all your savings in one account, and having to manually figure out if you're pulling out enough money for one goal, without jeopardizing something else you're saving for.\n\nIt definitely feels platform agnostic - Nice website interface, as well as mobie app interface (which is thankfully optimized both for a phone AND a tablet, at least on iOS, which is what I have.)\n\nVery much an AIO banking solution, literally - it has banking, credit card (which I recently got, but I heard it requires a relatively high score, based on others' experiences), an investment platform (I'm with Fidelity as my primary, but I may go ahead and use this as well), Loans (personal, student and I think home), Relay (think Mint, but I like this better), and able to get quotes on different types of insurance. It's a very nice system from what I've seen so far.\n\nWhen you sign up, you automatically get a checking and savings account (can't get one without the other) and a debit card ordered. You can also order a free checkbook in case you need to write an occasional check.\n\nYou gain rewards points just for doing things in the account, like logging in each day (10 points for a week long steak), points for attaching external accounts, etc. You have free access to the Allpoint network of ATMs. If you need to deposit cash, that option is available, but has to be done through Green Dot, and a participating location, which can charge up to A $4.95 fee. That's about the only fee you're gonna find in this account though. They have free overdraft protection, etc.\n\nSome of the features aren't available until you are a SoFi Plus member - the way to get that status is to just add SoFi bank as your direct deposit.\n\nAs far as digital-only bank (no physical locations), I dealt with this back when I signed up with USAA, and found it wasn't as scary as I thought. It's not really a big deal unless you have some kind of special requirement, like depositing cash, but as I said, there IS a paid option for that.\n\nIt's not really a High Yield Checking Account - I mean, it's higher than you're likely to find at most B&M banks (which is usually nothing), but it's 1.2% APY for both checking and savings without direct deposit. With DD, the savings goes up to the advertised 4.3%, but checking doesn't change.\n\nOverall I'd say yes, it's a good solution to have HYSA and checking all at one bank, and the vaults feature makes the savings part even easier.\n\nFinally, I would probably keep the local account open and minimally funded - you never know if there's a network error, or your debit card gets damaged/stolen. Keep enough in there to make sure you don't have any monthly fees. I have a credit union account I have a minimal amount direct deposited into, so I don't get dormant fees for basically never using it.\n\nHope this helps! Feel free to ask questions and I'll answer if I'm able to.\n\n### Comment ID k1tsm59 with +1 score by [(jeryo, Reddit, 2023-09-23)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/14uruq3/would_you_all_recommend_i_open_up_a_sofi_bank/k1tsm59/) (in reply to ID jr93pe2):\nHow do you get a minimal amount direct deposited into your local account?

I’m not a sofi user but I’m here because I got a text message from a legit-looking scam and wanted to confirm that that’s what it was in case someone was using my info to create an account.\n\nUnless you’re a cybersecurity expert and willing to sacrifice your quality of life for information security, profiles of your info already exist on the internet. Emails and IP texts are super cheap, so some phishing scams don’t care if your info was pulled from a specific company or service… they’ll just cast a wide net pretending that everyone is a customer, knowing that those who respond probably are customers. Then, even if they don’t successfully scam you, they’ll sell your packaged info to other scammers along with the information that you responded to or clicked on the initial attempt at contact. Other more targeted scam specialists will then use that purchased information to, (potentially in this case) target you with more sofi scams.\n\nThat’s how ‘leaks’ can appear to happen despite companies adamantly insisting they weren’t hacked. Sometimes it’s a real hack and the company is incompetent or lying, but often it’s a mass sale of fished data, in much the same way that aboveboard companies occasionally exchange legally obtained CRM sales data.\n\n## Comment ID jjtovmn with +7 score by [(divsandpremium50, Reddit, 2023-05-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/13f2o6e/almost_fell_for_sofi_scam/jjtovmn/) (in reply to ID 13f2o6e):\nMan they got me with this same thing, luckily I’m fine and sofi reimbursed me the charges.

          "advice": "*Criticisms aside, I think management is doing a great job, overall.\n\n1. I understand employee engagement and satisfaction is most easily measured by surveys and survey participation, but insisting everyone participates in an \"optional\" survey tells you less, and worse, potentially tells you the wrong things. You'll receive junk responses that have to be sifted through resulting in wasted staff hours, and many will be indistinguishable from honest feedback, simply for appearances. There will also be false positive answers from people who don't want to actually engage with the task; all ratings 5/5 with no substance. Additionally, measuring how many people fail to participate is *also* a key metric for employee engagement and satisfaction. More or less demanding feedback doesn't work in your favor.\n\n2. Please reassess how you reassess non-exempt wages. I know we have someone monitoring fair market wages in all locations, and while I can't speak for others, I don't feel like it's worked for me. I'm being forced by economic pressure into looking for openings with other companies that might compensate me more generously, and I don't want to. I really don't want to. I absolutely love working at SoFi, but my hand is being forced, and I don't think I'll be able to resist the financial tide much longer.\n\n3. Though the 2 hours paid self-guided training is very much appreciated, it is not enough to make any new knowledge really stick. This can be overcome by employees continuing these courses off the clock, which is fine, but without setting that expectation, I do not believe the company is getting a good ROI. I believe that either providing slightly more paid hours more frequently or specifically encouraging employees to finish courses outside scheduled hours will lead to better outcomes. In either case, a low cost incentive for completed courses might be a good idea, but particularly in the latter.",
          "adviceOriginal": null,
          "cons": "1. Feedback is valued so much that it's practically compulsory. I don't always have something to say, but I feel more or less forced to think of something for the quarterly surveys, even if its relatively inconsequential.\n\n2. Average cost of living in my city has outpaced my wages by ~6% over the last 4 years, while my rent alone has gone up ~11.67% while remaining below the median.\n\n3. Slow downsizing followed by COVID resulted in the closure of the CA operations office. Although this means I'm now fully remote (which is nice), advancement opportunities are significantly limited by location requirements, which is discouraging. This could be a factor for new hires who are fully remote.\n\n4. Rapidly increased outsourcing of lower operations roles, particularly customer service. The company insists onshore jobs are secure, but it's very hard to trust that completely.\n\n5. In spite of a focus on employee development, additional training in my role has been sparse. There are very good reasons for this, not the least of which is upheaval caused by promoting from within (which is a good thing overall). However, it is still an opportunity for improvement.\n\n6. No 401k match, and I haven't received RSU's since my original grant when hired, all of which vested years ago. This is probably not true for employees outside support roles, but I don't really know.",

          "pros": "1. Feedback is valued so much that it's practically compulsory.\n\n2. Company \"lives\" by its core values. They don't feel like hollow ideals we never deliver on. My favorite is: \"Do the right thing. If you’re not sure, do the harder thing.\"\n\n3. Surprisingly less evil than most finance companies, with a focus on member success. When I was in a customer \"facing\" role, I always felt like advocating for the consumer was both welcome and desired.\n\n4. In the last few years, the company has shifted to a strong emphasis on employee development and internal promotion. I have two hours of paid time per month to work on external skills training (formerly Udemy, now through LinkedIn).\n\n5. CEO has placed a focus on developing excellent corporate culture from day one (early 2018).\n\n6. Medical benefits are above average. Other myriad benefits are available with varying cost reductions, but the free Gympass (now Wellhub) membership and discounts for family members are a nice bonus.\n\n7. DEI is strong in multiple ways. SoFi accommodated my disability with no fuss or pushback, and there was no underhanded reprisal like being flagged as a \"problem employee\" who needs to be \"managed out of the business\" with excessive criticism and documentation of every possible perceived failure. *I cannot emphasize enough how valuable that is.\n\n8. Depending on your location and role, many positions are fully remote or on a 2:3 hybrid, including low level operations employees.\n\n9. Unless in a rigidly scheduled role, like customer \"facing\" roles, schedules are very flexible when needed. I've split my shift for a medical appointment on several occasions.\n\n10. Good amount of PTO for hourly employees with modest increases every year to year 6 (I believe). Exempt (salaried) employees have essentially unlimited PTO within reason, as long as business continuity is maintained.\n\n11. SoFi recognizes that good ideas come from all levels. First hand insight is valued, and appropriately escalated to stakeholders. That's not true for many companies, where lower tier employees are essentially told to leave thinking to the almighty middle management.",

You will always be just another number to them no matter how much they throw around and showcase their values. Prime example is the recent layoffs that happened. No warning and no real empathy given. The leader on the zoom was reading a script and they cut off access within minutes without any management reach out. \n\nTraining -Complete mess and have trainers who have not even done the actual job they are training on. So if you like being thrown it to fully do your job with a fraction of the knowledge needed to do it. This would be for you. \nThis company used to care but unfortunately you are just a number. \n\nThe other reviews about management are spot on.",

The program is rooted in our leveling guide, which each employee is evaluated against. We aim to create a consistently positive member experience with every interaction, and in order to do so, we set very specific metrics - all employees are provided and evaluated against. Every employee is held to the same set of metrics, and we strive to give everyone the training and tools they need to meet and exceed expectations. If you have any concerns about the process, we highly recommend you reach out to your People Business Partner (PBP) or your manager - who are here to support your career journey.

I regularly had to make calls that I knew were bad because we weren’t allowed time to properly do research. The company wouldn’t even pay for a backup IP search tool and we were stuck using whatever we could find on the internet. In the last year, SoFi seemed to be moving backwards in terms of progress and job quality. Not forwards. RTO, removal of development opportunities, lower raises, downsizing, etc all makes the company seem less like a FinTech and more like it was trying to be a bank. Which it didn’t know how to do yet.",

You will always be just another number to them no matter how much they throw around and showcase their values. Prime example is the recent layoffs that happened. No warning and no real empathy given. The leader on the zoom was reading a script and they cut off access within minutes without any management reach out. \n\nTraining -Complete mess and have trainers who have not even done the actual job they are training on. So if you like being thrown it to fully do your job with a fraction of the knowledge needed to do it. This would be for you. \nThis company used to care but unfortunately you are just a number. \n\nThe other reviews about management are spot on.",

The engineering primitives and infrastructure that would make it possible to build interesting things quickly and reliably either doesn’t exist or is so minimally invested in that each project tends to need to whip together its own basics in the tiny window of time before the next “extremely important” project is shoved on a group’s plate by various independent areas of leadership that don't understand what’s taking so long.",

I regularly had to make calls that I knew were bad because we weren’t allowed time to properly do research. The company wouldn’t even pay for a backup IP search tool and we were stuck using whatever we could find on the internet. In the last year, SoFi seemed to be moving backwards in terms of progress and job quality. Not forwards.

        "advice": "*Criticisms aside, I think management is doing a great job, overall.\n\n1. I understand employee engagement and satisfaction is most easily measured by surveys and survey participation, but insisting everyone participates in an \"optional\" survey tells you less, and worse, potentially tells you the wrong things. You'll receive junk responses that have to be sifted through resulting in wasted staff hours, and many will be indistinguishable from honest feedback, simply for appearances. There will also be false positive answers from people who don't want to actually engage with the task; all ratings 5/5 with no substance. Additionally, measuring how many people fail to participate is *also* a key metric for employee engagement and satisfaction. More or less demanding feedback doesn't work in your favor.\n\n2. Please reassess how you reassess non-exempt wages. I know we have someone monitoring fair market wages in all locations, and while I can't speak for others, I don't feel like it's worked for me. I'm being forced by economic pressure into looking for openings with other companies that might compensate me more generously, and I don't want to. I really don't want to. I absolutely love working at SoFi, but my hand is being forced, and I don't think I'll be able to resist the financial tide much longer.\n\n3. Though the 2 hours paid self-guided training is very much appreciated, it is not enough to make any new knowledge really stick. This can be overcome by employees continuing these courses off the clock, which is fine, but without setting that expectation, I do not believe the company is getting a good ROI. I believe that either providing slightly more paid hours more frequently or specifically encouraging employees to finish courses outside scheduled hours will lead to better outcomes. In either case, a low cost incentive for completed courses might be a good idea, but particularly in the latter.",
        "cons": "1. Feedback is valued so much that it's practically compulsory. I don't always have something to say, but I feel more or less forced to think of something for the quarterly surveys, even if its relatively inconsequential.\n\n2. Average cost of living in my city has outpaced my wages by ~6% over the last 4 years, while my rent alone has gone up ~11.67% while remaining below the median.\n\n3. Slow downsizing followed by COVID resulted in the closure of the CA operations office. Although this means I'm now fully remote (which is nice), advancement opportunities are significantly limited by location requirements, which is discouraging. This could be a factor for new hires who are fully remote.\n\n4. Rapidly increased outsourcing of lower operations roles, particularly customer service. The company insists onshore jobs are secure, but it's very hard to trust that completely.\n\n5. In spite of a focus on employee development, additional training in my role has been sparse. There are very good reasons for this, not the least of which is upheaval caused by promoting from within (which is a good thing overall). However, it is still an opportunity for improvement.\n\n6. No 401k match, and I haven't received RSU's since my original grant when hired, all of which vested years ago. This is probably not true for employees outside support roles, but I don't really know.",
        "lengthOfEmployment": 6,
        "pros": "1. Feedback is valued so much that it's practically compulsory.\n\n2. Company \"lives\" by its core values. They don't feel like hollow ideals we never deliver on. My favorite is: \"Do the right thing. If you’re not sure, do the harder thing.\"\n\n3. Surprisingly less evil than most finance companies, with a focus on member success. When I was in a customer \"facing\" role, I always felt like advocating for the consumer was both welcome and desired.\n\n4. In the last few years, the company has shifted to a strong emphasis on employee development and internal promotion. I have two hours of paid time per month to work on external skills training (formerly Udemy, now through LinkedIn).\n\n5. CEO has placed a focus on developing excellent corporate culture from day one (early 2018).\n\n6. Medical benefits are above average. Other myriad benefits are available with varying cost reductions, but the free Gympass (now Wellhub) membership and discounts for family members are a nice bonus.\n\n7. DEI is strong in multiple ways. SoFi accommodated my disability with no fuss or pushback, and there was no underhanded reprisal like being flagged as a \"problem employee\" who needs to be \"managed out of the business\" with excessive criticism and documentation of every possible perceived failure. *I cannot emphasize enough how valuable that is.\n\n8. Depending on your location and role, many positions are fully remote or on a 2:3 hybrid, including low level operations employees.\n\n9. Unless in a rigidly scheduled role, like customer \"facing\" roles, schedules are very flexible when needed. I've split my shift for a medical appointment on several occasions.\n\n10. Good amount of PTO for hourly employees with modest increases every year to year 6 (I believe). Exempt (salaried) employees have essentially unlimited PTO within reason, as long as business continuity is maintained.\n\n11. SoFi recognizes that good ideas come from all levels. First hand insight is valued, and appropriately escalated to stakeholders. That's not true for many companies, where lower tier employees are essentially told to leave thinking to the almighty middle management.",

The festival, a celebration of creative minds, is set to take place Sept. 20-22 on Emory University’s Oxford College campus.\n\nThe group, comprising Sophie Hawley-Weld and Tucker Halpern, recently released their third studio album “BREAD.” An acronym for Be Really Energetic and Dance, “BREAD” encapsulates their infectious music, which spreads themes of liberation, unity and self-empowerment. The band has amassed more than three billion streams, earned platinum and gold records on five continents and been featured in several brand campaigns for Apple, Peloton and Smartwater.\n\nAs part of the festival, the duo will speak with Matt Whyte, host of the Sing for Science podcast, which connects musicians with scientists. SOFI TUKKER will chat about bread, the beloved food staple, and the chemistry that makes it so delicious with Maria Ortiz — the food scientist behind the popular Instagram account All You Knead is Bread — on Sunday, Sept. 22 at 4:30 p.m.\n\nHosted by Emory’s Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, the event — which is free and open to the public — also features live music, local food vendors, children’s programming and exhibits. Festival registration is open.\n\nSOFI TUKKER joins the previously announced keynote speaker, renowned rapper, producer and record executive Jermaine Dupri, and more than 40 other speakers at the festival, intended to connect students and the greater community with visionary scholars, creators and thought leaders, including a Pulitzer-winning journalist, transformative business executive, New York Times-bestselling music historian and innovative toy designer.\n\nDuring the festival’s keynote session Friday evening, Dupri, a Grammy Award winner, Atlanta native and founder of So So Def Recordings, will engage in conversation with Whyte and Joycelyn Wilson, assistant professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at Georgia Tech. Through her work as an ethnographer, Wilson has traced the cultural forces that have shaped Atlanta’s unique identity as the thriving epicenter of hip hop and R&B.\n\nDelving into multiple themes\n\nAdditional speaker sessions on Saturday and Sunday will cover an array of themes including science, history, literature, entrepreneurship, music and cinematography and photography. The full schedule and speaker biographies are now available on the newly launched Ideas Festival Emory website.\n\nJust a few of the notable speakers include:\n\nBarbara Kopple, a two-time Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker;\n\nVirginia Willis, a James Beard award-winning cookbook author and chef;\n\nJon Goode, an Emmy-nominated writer whose work has been featured on CNN, HBO and BET;\n\nStephanie Stuckey, board chair of Stuckey’s, the candy manufacturer; and\n\nCarrie Buse, head of design for Mattel’s Future Lab, which focuses on innovative products and play experiences.\n\nThroughout the weekend, Ideas Festival Emory will feature live music and entertainment on the Oxford College quad, photography exhibits and food and drink vendors.\n\nThe event will also include children’s programming and collaborations with local schools. In partnership with the Newton Education Foundation, the Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement will host hundreds of students from Newton County Schools, providing them with a unique learning opportunity to connect with children’s book authors.\n\nThe festival has attracted sponsors committed to engaging individuals and families across the metro Atlanta region in its programming, including Lumina Foundation, WABE, the City of Covington and Rough Draft Atlanta.\n\nKen Carter, Charles Howard Candler Professor of Psychology and founding director of the Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, believes the festival — the center’s flagship event — will be distinctive in its mission to share ideas and spark curiosity with local and global audiences.\n\n“Ideas Festival Emory is a celebration of creativity and innovation, connecting the public with visionary leaders who inspire and challenge us,” says Carter. “We hope the festival will ignite new ideas and inspire meaningful conversations, in an environment that will be fun for people of all ages.”\n\nWhile attendees will engage with and learn from speakers during the sessions, Carter hopes the festival will have an impact that stretches beyond the three-day event. Speaker sessions will be recorded for an upcoming podcast that will help extend the festival's reach and attract curious listeners from around the world.\n\nThe Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, established in 2023, aims to help faculty and students proactively engage in public conversation and increase confidence in the value of scholarship and evidence-based research. With plans to expand its programming and host a Public Scholarship Academy for faculty in May 2025, the center — housed at Oxford College — hopes to establish itself as a novel space where scholars share knowledge and insights directly with the community.\n\n“I’m proud that Oxford College is home to the Emory Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, and we look forward to hosting this incredible weekend of exploration and discovery on our beautiful campus,” says Oxford Dean Badia Ahad.\n\n“Bringing together a diversity of scholars, artists and writers to discuss some of the most pressing and complex issues of our time is particularly important in this cultural moment when we need more and better models of civil discourse, free expression of ideas and constructive dialogue,” Ahad continues. “This perfectly captures the spirit of education and collaboration we embrace here at Oxford and Emory.”",
      "# [Launch Dates Confirmed for TGL presented by SoFi, Starting in Prime Time on ESPN](https://tglgolf.com/articles/2024/03/tgl-presented-by-sofi--coming-january-2025/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=website_internal&utm_campaign=web_link_1)\nMatches 1, 2 and 3 of the first TGL presented by SoFi season will all take place on Tuesdays in January and be live from SoFi Center. The first night of TGL action will be Tuesday, January 7th.\n\nThe full TGL schedule - including matchups - will be announced later this year.\n\nThe launch of TGL’s inaugural season will benefit from promotion during ESPN’s comprehensive coverage of the NFL Playoffs and new 12-team College Football Playoff. At this time of year, ESPN’s coverage includes TGL’s week 2 match on Tuesday, Jan 14, the night following ESPN’s Monday Night Football Wild Card Playoff game, and TGL’s week 3 match on Tuesday, Jan 21, the night following ESPN’s coverage of the College Football Playoff National Championship Game.\n\nESPN’s NFL Playoff game and College Football National Championship Game are traditionally the network’s most-watched games each year and drive January as the network’s most-watched month.\n\n“As we plan the 2025 launch of TGL presented by SoFi, we now have the first three Tuesdays in January circled to introduce sports fans to this new form of team golf. January is a tremendous time of year for fans looking for prime time sports and TGL’s launch will complement the start of the PGA TOUR season and take advantage of ESPN’s promotional machine across their coverage of the NFL and college football playoffs,” said Mike McCarley, founder and CEO of TMRW Sports.\n\n“We’re grateful for our tremendous partner SoFi, who shares in our vision to harness technology to create new approaches within traditional institutions. As construction proceeds on SoFi Center, we’re eager to introduce sports fans to TGL as we focus on the league’s debut this coming January.”\n\n“From our very first conversation, there’s been a natural alignment between TGL’s innovative, tech-forward approach to golf with SoFi’s similar approach to helping millions get their money right with our digital all-in-one banking and financial services platform,” said SoFi CEO Anthony Noto. “Investing in sports like our partnerships with the NFL and the NBA has proven unequivocally valuable, and we’re thrilled to be partnering with TMRW Sports to bring the SoFi Center and TGL to life.”\n\nAll the action will take place in the custom-built SoFi Center, a steel-supported structure located on the campus of Palm Beach State College in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. The six teams consist of the PGA TOUR's top talent who will compete in a 15-match regular season, plus semifinals and finals matches in the 250,000-square-foot venue.\n\nSoFi Center is an unprecedented, tech-infused arena for golf and will create an intimate and unique “greenside” experience for fans with 1,500 seats wrapping around TGL’s field of play, which is similar to the size of a football field at 97-yards long and 50-yards wide.\n\nTGL matches will start with teams teeing off from real grass tee boxes to play custom-designed, virtual holes projected onto a 64’x53’ screen, more than 24 times larger than a standard golf simulator screen (144 square feet, 16’x9’). Once teams are inside approximately 50 yards they will transition to live action and finish each hole within TGL’s GreenZone, a 22,475-square-foot short game complex that transforms between holes.\n\nThe GreenZone will use advanced technology to make each hole a unique challenge for the teams, including its 41-yard-wide turntable that rotates the green and three bunkers to change approach angles and using nearly 600 motorized actuators as part of Full Swing’s Virtual Green technology embedded under the synthetic putting surface to morph its topography.\n\nEvery shot will be broadcast live during TGL, with teams playing within a 40-second shot clock. All players will also be mic’d up to bring fans closer to the action with real-time strategy discussions.",
