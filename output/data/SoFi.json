      "# [SoFi Candidate Resource Website](https://sofietyinfo.sofi.com/faq)\nDue to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, all interviews are being conducted remotely via Zoom, but this is subject to change.

      "# [SoFi Candidate Resource Website](https://sofietyinfo.sofi.com/interviews)\nMedito Meditation\n\nInterviewing can be stressful and there’s no better way to calm your nerves than to take a deep breath and re-center yourself. Our favorite way to do this? Take a pause via the Medito website and app - we’re big fans of the Work Life Meditation and Walking Meditation.\n\nThe best thing about Medito? It’s free!\n\n2. Practicing to Make Perfect\n\nDifferent companies or organizations may use different platforms to host the interview—from Zoom to Google Hangouts to other programs. You don’t need to become an expert in these features but, it’s a good idea to become comfortable at:\n\n• Using the video software, download and try it out well before the actual call.\n\n• Dialing in to scheduled calls\n\n• Checking the audio and the camera\n\n• Understanding what the interviewer can see\n\nYour Story\n\nRecruiters are looking for someone who is living a purpose-driven life and who wants to work at their specific company for a real, heartfelt reason. This is why it’s powerful to start your pitch off with one or two sentences that paint a picture of a deeper meaning to why you are there. This can connect to a defining moment in your life that influenced your career path or helped you make a career pivot.\n\nYour Cuff\n\nIt’s important to take a moment to address any spots in your resume or job history that may leave recruiters with questions - it should be brief and “off the cuff.” Perhaps you have a gap on their resume, you are transitioning out of industries, or you’re trying to leave a job they just started. Interviewers may wonder about something in your application, but instead of asking about it, they will give you the opportunity to address it. So use the cuff to clarify what you think needs explaining, and do it quickly!\n\nYour Golden Skill\n\nRecruiters are hiring for a particular role, so it’s important you share a skillset applicable to the role at hand. This can be a testimonial from your boss or a colleague who has given you praise for that one golden skill and presents it in an honest and not overly boastful way. If you aren’t sure about your strongest skill set, ask the people you work closely with for their insight.\n\nYour Goal\n\nAt this point you’ve shared a bit about your career journey so it’s important to highlight your goal to get the job. You’ll want to speak to the importance of the company’s mission and how that relates to you and the work you would do in this role.",

      "# [Crypto 101: A Beginner's Guide to Cryptocurrency on 2023-11-16](https://www.sofi.com/crypto-guide/)\nCrypto Basics\n\nWhat Is Cryptocurrency?\n\nCryptocurrency, often simply called “crypto,” is any type of decentralized, digital currency that’s based on cryptography. Those three terms are key to understanding the thousands of different types of crypto being traded today.\n\n“Decentralized” means that cryptocurrency isn’t issued by a central authority like a government or bank, the way the dollar, euro, yen, and other fiat currencies are. Instead, cryptocurrencies are created, exchanged, and often overseen by a distributed peer-to-peer network.\n\nCrypto is digital, meaning two things. First, with a couple of exceptions, the value of most crypto is not pegged to a fiat currency like the dollar or euro, nor is it determined by a precious metal like gold. And though people may refer to crypto in physical terms (e.g., as coins), crypto is generated and traded in only a digital format.\n\nCryptography refers to the mathematical technique used to secure each unit of cryptocurrency and ensure it can’t be copied.\n\nMost crypto exists on a blockchain platform. Blockchain is the digital ledger that records most crypto transactions. This use of blockchain technology as a foundational element for cryptocurrency began in 2009, in tandem with the launch of Bitcoin. But blockchain technology is evolving rapidly, and a range of other industries are exploring its potential applications as well.\n\nHow Does Cryptocurrency Work?\n\nThere are thousands of cryptocurrencies, and while many are designed to provide some new feature or function on a given blockchain platform, many, if not most are founded on similar principles to those that established Bitcoin. Crypto is secured by a peer-to-peer network, and users can trade or transfer value — globally and almost instantly, 24 hours per day, seven days per week — without relying on a middleman, like a bank or payment processor.\n\nCryptocurrencies are considered secure because they employ a “trustless” system of verification for all transactions. This means that users don’t have to rely on a third party to verify transactions: the system itself is self-governing.\n\nAs of November 2023, estimates of the number of cryptocurrency you can trade are around 8,800, with a total market capitalization of over $1.32 trillion. The biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are Bitcoin and Ethereum – by a wide margin. Cryptocurrencies are generally stored in digital wallets, commonly a blockchain wallet, which allows users to manage and trade different crypto.\n\nWhat Is Blockchain Technology?\n\nThe widespread use of blockchain technology as the underlying platform for most forms of crypto began in 2009, when an innovative use of blockchain enabled the successful launch of Bitcoin. For that reason, many people think of blockchain and cryptocurrency as synonymous, when in fact blockchain technology has a wide variety of applications.\n\nBlockchain is a digital, append-only ledger that can be used to track or record almost any type of asset, from goods and services to patents, smart contracts, and more. It’s transparent, meaning the transactions on a public blockchain are accessible to anyone, and unlike a physical system of record keeping, the record of transactions is designed to be permanent and immutable.\n\nWhy Is It Called Blockchain?\n\nThe reason blockchain records are theoretically unchangeable is because the system is built from “blocks” of data that are “chained” together in chronological order (hence the name “blockchain”) so that all transactions are visible to everyone on the network. Blockchain technology relies on cryptography to secure these transactions and, in the case of many types of crypto, to mine coins and tokens.\n\nWhy Is Blockchain Considered Secure?\n\nA blockchain runs on a decentralized network of computers, called nodes, which enable a form of consensus (peer-to-peer) confirmation that can drive faster, more secure transactions. The distributed, self-governing nature of blockchain thus makes fraud and duplication far more difficult compared with legacy record-keeping systems.\n\nThe combination of speed, security, and transparency has not only enabled the growth of cryptocurrencies worldwide, many other industries are now exploring blockchain’s uses as well.\n\nWhat are Crypto Exchanges?\n\nWith the exception of emerging crypto-based securities, it’s generally not possible to trade crypto on a traditional exchange, which is why you need a crypto exchange.\n\nThere are three main types of crypto exchanges: centralized, decentralized, and hybrid. While centralized exchanges are still more common for trading crypto, it’s important to understand the differences among the three so you can decide which is best for you.\n\nCentralized\n\nA centralized cryptocurrency exchange is a platform where cryptos are bought and sold, with the help of a third party to conduct the transactions. On a centralized exchange you can use a traditional, aka fiat currency, like the dollar to execute trades, as well as trading crypto itself.\n\nDecentralized\n\nDecentralized exchanges (DEX) are more aligned with the spirit of crypto, in that these exchanges allow crypto investors to trade directly with each other, without the need for a middleman. In theory, a DEX might be more secure since there’s no central platform that can be hacked. Also, without the need for third parties, you might see lower fees and faster transaction speeds on a DEX.\n\nHybrid\n\nHybrid exchanges are less common than either centralized or decentralized exchanges. They aim to combine features of both: e.g., the liquidity of a centralized exchange and the security and anonymity of a DEX.\n\nWhen choosing the exchange where you prefer to trade crypto, there are other issues to consider, including ease of use, whether your funds might be insured, as well as other considerations.\n\nBitcoin and Beyond\n\nBitcoin: The OG Crypto\n\nBitcoin (BTC) was the first cryptocurrency to be created in 2009 by a person (or possibly a group) using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was designed to be independent of any government or central bank. Instead it relies on blockchain technology, a decentralized public ledger that contains a digital record of every Bitcoin transaction.\n\nIn essence, Bitcoin established the basic system of cryptography and consensus (i.e., peer-to-peer) verification that is the foundation of most forms of crypto today.\n\nBitcoin History\n\nIn 2008, an individual or group of individuals going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, published a paper called, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” It was not the first case ever made for a digital currency — there were many attempts in the decades prior — but this was perhaps the first to propose a “trustless” system of electronic transactions that would depend on a peer-to-peer system of verification via blockchain technology. This innovative approach also solved a persistent problem with digital currencies, the so-called double-spending problem — or the risk that digital currencies could be hacked and spent more than once.\n\nThanks to the research detailed in this paper, the first Bitcoins were created in January 2009, and the Bitcoin mining system was established. But the number of BTC in the market is capped. While there are more than 18.8 million Bitcoin tokens in circulation as of November 2021, worth over $1 trillion, the total limit is 21 million BTC.\n\nHow Bitcoin Works\n\nBitcoin miners use powerful computers to verify blocks of transactions and generate more Bitcoins — a complex, time-consuming process called proof-of-work (PoW). Each block of transactions is logged permanently on the blockchain, which helps to validate and secure each Bitcoin and the network as a whole. Owing to the vast number of computers or nodes on the Bitcoin blockchain, the PoW process ends up using so much energy that many people question whether it’s sustainable, as noted.\n\nHow To Get Bitcoin\n\nThThere are a few different ways to buy Bitcoin.\n\n• Exchanges. As noted above, you can trade crypto — including Bitcoin — on centralized, decentralized, or hybrid exchanges. All you need is a crypto wallet for storing your Bitcoins.\n\n• ATMs. There are many crypto ATMs scattered around the country where you can purchase Bitcoin. Unlike a traditional ATM, though, you can’t withdraw actual cash from these machines; they make digital only transactions via the blockchain.\n\n• Brokerages. A growing number of brokers now allow you to buy and sell crypto, similar to any other security, including SoFi Invest®.\n\nPros and Cons of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin may be the oldest and most popular form of crypto (by market share), but it has its pros and cons.\n\n• Market capitalization. The crypto-verse comprises thousands of coins and tokens, but Bitcoin is the biggest of them all, with a market cap of more than $675 billion, as of November 2023. For context: Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap, is around $225 billion.\n\n• Volatility. Bitcoin is extremely volatile. Even within the course of a single day, the value can fluctuate by thousands. And on a broader scale, between January and November 2023, Bitcoin’s value was as high as $35,000, and as low as $16,000.\n\n• Not SIPC insured. Most investors are insured by the SIPC up to $500,000 if a brokerage fails (or funds are stolen). But the SIPC doesn’t cover crypto.\n\n• Regulation and usage. The inconsistency of regulations governing crypto has likely limited the use of these currencies around the world. That said, a number of companies do accept Bitcoin as payment — just do your research first.",

You have to go through more trouble in more circles calling the company just to delete it when you should be able to do that yourself and it should verify the same as it did when you created it.

Great HYSA rates, easy way to track and transfer money etc.\n\nHere is where I would like to see improvements however. Relay (their money tracking functionality) is great but I wish there were better ability to customize how things are tracked. Most importantly bank transfers from my BofA account to Sofi read as expenses since I have my BofA hooked up via plad.\nThere are a host of transactions like this that make the tracking functionality weak. It will look like I have 7k expenses per month just because of money transfers. The only way to resolve is manually going into each transaction and marking it as a transfer / exclude. This defeats the purpose I could do that in excel at that point.\n\nI wish they would focus more resources into those tracking features and net worth tracker, as well as build in more granularity into the invest features would be nice to use Sofi to execute short term trades but currently it’s not there yet",

With that being said, when I tried to buy a $15,000 dollars car IN CASH, this bank prevented me from doing so that the seller ended up selling it to someone else for the delay SOFI caused because I couldn’t take out the cash or Zelle it due to the slavery limits this bank has. So my next and final option was a simple money transfer, guess how that went? Well when I tried to transfer money, SOFI CANCELED the wire transfer and said it can only be done if you are buying a home 😂. So if you want your own money to be limited, and I mean limited, then this is your bank. Plus this bank has no branches that you can walk in for help. Sure the 2 day early pay is nice, but the money hostage is not worth it. I’m going back to US Bank, no hassle at all. *Update, so there still has been no update or change of limit on SOFI account, I came back to US bank and man, am I glad I did. If you need to make a large withdrawal from a bank, or make a large transfer, DO NOT GET THIS BANK. You’ll save yourself a hassle. Other than that, if this bank is working for you then great. 👍",

I’ve been banking since the 80’s. I’ve used many banks and watched and participated in the transition to online banking over the years. I can say without a doubt SOFI is the best bank I’ve ever used and I’ve used them all over the years. Completely blows away the Wells Fargo’s, Chase, Bank of America etc etc. The SOFI app itself is definitely the best one out there. Banking with SOFI is easy and for once actually makes me money. No fees and only profit! My only wish is this bank would have been around 20 years ago as I’d have a lot more money today if they did.

The Investing side is very surface level, beginner and underwhelming. For example, charts for stocks don't have a scale at all. What? How is that useful? A line drawn on a blank background gives no real information of any price movement if there is no scale on the sides of the chart and horizontal and vertical lines to guide.\n\nA gtc order in the list of orders doesn't also show the current price of the security. You have to go look that up yourself somewhere else. \n\nI don't recommend the investment side until it matures.",

You have the ability to pay one time or pay monthly; what about my car insurance which is due every six months? Or my trash collection service, which is due every three months.?  Annoying. \n\nAlso I set up a “vault” for my child’s nest egg. I appreciate the nature of the app - to hide long term savings from routine view. That is a good idea!  BUT I have not figured out how to see how much is actually in that vault AT ALL. I would like to check in on it now and then. I promise I won’t spend it. This could be a ME (user) issue, not an APP issue. \n\nOn the plus side it is a clear easy to read and use app for the most part. Encourages saving.",

After having difficulty with my previous bank I decided to take the plunge. I now have a checking and savings account with you all as well as your credit card. I love how seamless it is to bank with you all. SoFi has answered all of my questions as I make this transition. Thank you and look forward to banking with SoFi for a long time",

I used it as a back up account for certain things as one back I doesn’t offer Zelle so I used it for that purpose! I had been moving and my friend lost his id and debit card and needed to get something’s taken care of! Moving needed to get a U-Haul and had to be out because new tenants were moving in! So he sent me some money and I used my card to pay for the moving and him to get a hotel for a 10 days till he could be in his new place? There was no choice so I guess because I had been Zelled 3000 they considered it fraudulent! Which to me is really terrible! I could see if I was randomly moving large amounts constanly yes! I mean I get the scams and frauds out there but one time! Someone needed access to these things and fast! No time to wait for a new card to come! So someone gave me 3000 isn’t that still okay to do for someone? I don’t see why that is grounds to close my account! Thanks SoFi!",

The app is great, I’ve had no issues banking and customer service was reachable in the chat function rather quickly. My gripe is that SoFi offers pay in four. I wasn’t aware of this until I was researching different pay in four apps as I am a frequent user. There’s literally no option to request or apply for the feature and upon reaching a representative they couldn’t help either . This was quite disappointing as I’m not sure what the criteria is or how to add the feature. I have a decent amount DD weekly and clearly it can be seen that I use the service elsewhere. It would just be super convenient to use my bank where my money already resides. Please fix this as to give the consumer the option to apply. The algorithm being used , which I’m not privy to the metrix, isn’t taking key aspects into account. Other than that things have been quite good at SoFi for me, my wife also has brought her assets over as well. \n\nThank you ,\nAllen",

Thus causing negative impact or negative account balances. Without Chime to Chime sending money was an issue especially if your expecting transactions delivered immediately. Personal checks would take 5-10 business days if your sender didn’t have Chime. Could not update to Joint Bank Accounts.

      "# STAY AWAY FROM THIS BANK, 1 stars [(Kameron.P, Apple App Store, 2024-08-27)](https://apple/11659024347)\nI recently got scammed out of money and called to get the issue resolved, but they said that in order for them to dispute the transaction I would have to wait till it’s done pending. So I patiently waited, for a WEEK, until it was done pending. After it went through, on my pay day, I called to get it disputed and they said it would take 10 business days for me to get my money back and to add insult to injury they want me to provide information to screenshots as proof of the scam in order for it to help my case. Never in my life had I heard of a bank that does business this way with its customers! I banked with Chase before this and anytime I was unfortunately scammed, all I had to do was call and dispute it and was able to get the money back the same day!! I guess it’s time to switch back to Chase now, I don’t even know why I bothered to switch to this bank. So do yourselves a favor and stay away from this bank if you value your money especially if you have the unfortunate experience of getting scammed because this bank doesn’t care.",

They’ll take it out of your loan balance the same day as well. However, with regards to their Creditcard, that is NOT the way it happens. EFT the balance payment on my account from the SAME account the loan is paid from. Payment set up on Tuesday, taken Tuesday afternoon from my bank, balance shows ZERO but they essentially FROZE the card and will NOT release the credit limit for 1.5 WEEKS AFTER they have taken the money from my account. Good thing it’s paid off and I now will switch auto payments for Apple and others to a different card. This card is TRASH and will never use it again.

I have actually shifted to use them as my primary banking and taxable brokerage investing. There isn’t much wrong with Sofi as an app with a WHOLE LOT of benefit. Great HYSA rates, easy way to track and transfer money etc.\n\nHere is where I would like to see improvements however. Relay (their money tracking functionality) is great but I wish there were better ability to customize how things are tracked. Most importantly bank transfers from my BofA account to Sofi read as expenses since I have my BofA hooked up via plad.\nThere are a host of transactions like this that make the tracking functionality weak. It will look like I have 7k expenses per month just because of money transfers. The only way to resolve is manually going into each transaction and marking it as a transfer / exclude. This defeats the purpose I could do that in excel at that point.\n\nI wish they would focus more resources into those tracking features and net worth tracker, as well as build in more granularity into the invest features would be nice to use Sofi to execute short term trades but currently it’s not there yet",

My reason being is because you can not go into any branch and withdraw any large amount of cash even with a bank teller. Sofi bank teller withdraw cash limit is only $150.00 dollars and $1,000.00 dollars with the ATM, that makes no sense. Then Zelle’s transfer limit is $1,000.00 dollars as well. With that being said, when I tried to buy a $15,000 dollars car IN CASH, this bank prevented me from doing so that the seller ended up selling it to someone else for the delay SOFI caused because I couldn’t take out the cash or Zelle it due to the slavery limits this bank has. So my next and final option was a simple money transfer, guess how that went? Well when I tried to transfer money, SOFI CANCELED the wire transfer and said it can only be done if you are buying a home 😂. So if you want your own money to be limited, and I mean limited, then this is your bank. Plus this bank has no branches that you can walk in for help. Sure the 2 day early pay is nice, but the money hostage is not worth it. I’m going back to US Bank, no hassle at all. *Update, so there still has been no update or change of limit on SOFI account, I came back to US bank and man, am I glad I did. If you need to make a large withdrawal from a bank, or make a large transfer, DO NOT GET THIS BANK. You’ll save yourself a hassle. Other than that, if this bank is working for you then great. 👍",

I hope you don’t take this review lately and you take steps to consider getting peoples money cleared faster than that because this is very hard on people like me who don’t have a lot of money at all because I literally put my last $50 into that account, which is causing me to go hungry all weekend until Tuesday because I only work extreme part-tim\nSincerely, Erica Jones",

It’s minor but I would love to have some shorter term vaults on top and ones I use less on the bottom and as of now the only way to do that is to delete them and try to open them in the order that you want them.

Their banking side of the business does not communicate with their investment side. It was set up like this on purpose. Nikki in the investment/brokerage explained to me that they have layers built in on purpose. So if you are using both the bank and brokerage when you call one they can’t see the others systems. I spent 10 days on the phone to get a issues resolved with them and never got to actually talk to someone who could help fix the problem. They use a 3rd party to transfer money between the bank and brokerage and can’t see what happens with that company either. I believe it is Apex. Absolutely do not ever bank or invest with sofi. There are many more reasons I have to leave or never bank with them. If there was ever a bank that deserved to go out of business it is them.",

You basically have to read your transactions through a little window. The Zelle experience is bad. It’s a webview into a pretty poorly designed interface that doesn’t support autofill. Before they added Zelle to this app, I could use the vastly better Zelle app, but now I can’t. Also the app sometimes shows your personal information & asks you to confirm that it’s still correct when you sign in. It shows my old address, so I change it & press submit. Nothing ever happens after that. I can press submit all I want & I never leave that screen, so I have to press skip. Then the app is like “are you sure you don’t want to do it now?” Actually I would. Anyway, when you skip, it makes you promise to do it next time, so this actually happens every time I open the app.",

The Investing side is very surface level, beginner and underwhelming. For example, charts for stocks don't have a scale at all. What? How is that useful? A line drawn on a blank background gives no real information of any price movement if there is no scale on the sides of the chart and horizontal and vertical lines to guide.\n\nA gtc order in the list of orders doesn't also show the current price of the security.

Annoying. \n\nAlso I set up a “vault” for my child’s nest egg. I appreciate the nature of the app - to hide long term savings from routine view. That is a good idea!  BUT I have not figured out how to see how much is actually in that vault AT ALL. I would like to check in on it now and then. I promise I won’t spend it.

The app is great, I’ve had no issues banking and customer service was reachable in the chat function rather quickly. My gripe is that SoFi offers pay in four. I wasn’t aware of this until I was researching different pay in four apps as I am a frequent user. There’s literally no option to request or apply for the feature and upon reaching a representative they couldn’t help either . This was quite disappointing as I’m not sure what the criteria is or how to add the feature. I have a decent amount DD weekly and clearly it can be seen that I use the service elsewhere. It would just be super convenient to use my bank where my money already resides. Please fix this as to give the consumer the option to apply.

I literally cannot login to move my money between accounts to BUY A NEW PHONE because they refuse to verify me any other way than through a phone. May as well be a scam with operation procedures like that. As soon as I somehow get around this shit I'm getting all of my money away from them posthaste.\n\nEDIT: For anyone asking/wondering, this was after calling their phone support and being told that without a phone number for them to verify, there's nothing to be done. And it seems to have devolved to people happily enjoying SoFi with no intent on losing their phones or other verification methods ever just lambasting me for a mistake out of my control, I'll no longer be engaging.

Yes it sucks you can't visit a branch and verify like a normal bank.\n\nBut anyways, like I suggested in one of the comments, go to your cell phone carrier's store and get a new SIM card with your phone number on it, it's $20 or less, sometimes free.

Never had issues with any of my banks like you see posted here. I just read another post about direct deposit issues. Sounds like they need to get their shit together. Maybe physical offices instead of a bunch of apathetic, mouth-breathing apes working from home with your PII would be a better idea. I guess I really dont get what the appeal is from bundling all your financial services togerger if you have a good chance to fuck everything up on any given day.

Most people love to complain. \n2. A decent chunk of the complaints I have seen when more information comes out are a combination of the fault of the OP due to either unrealistic expectations, new account holders that are still looking to gain “full access”, or living paycheck to paycheck and a direct deposit being delayed by an hour becomes a catastrophe. \n3.  SoFi is a newer bank (recent bank charter compared to regular FINTech that isn’t chartered) and therefore SoFi is a little more risk adverse until they get to know you so people will be declined for the credit card, limited on check deposit limits, take a little longer to clear funds when first setting up account etc.  \n4. There will be occasional issues and you should have a second bank that you have established for check cashing, cash deposits, emergency fund etc. \n\nBiggest advice is to do research, be patient if you are a newer customer, and provide constructive feedback to SoFi so they can continue to fix issues when they arise.\n\n## Comment ID ldwyx77 with +10 score by [(Mav3r1ck77, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1e70nxm/why_so_many_issues_with_sofi/ldwyx77/) (in reply to ID 1e70nxm):\nI have never had any issues with sofi.

Also, folks are more likely to speak of negative experiences than positives.\n\nI’ve been with SoFi just short of 2 years - have had no issues whatsoever. I do keep a brick-mortal checking account ($4.95 monthly fee) for ATM convenience. \n\nAlso, I was the victim of check fraud - one of my rent checks was intercepted in the mailbox and the culprits rinsed the check and made it out to someone else with a different amount. I contacted SoFi, they quickly started a fraud investigation process, had me sign/notarize an affidavit, and the money was back in my account by the following week.\n\nI like SoFi. With the explosion of HYSAs and Fintech brokerages (with their shady legal writing, ie. we are not a bank, your funds are sweeped/pooled/held at partner banks, and are only FDIC ensured when they arrive at said banks, etc etc), SoFi gives me great peace of mind. \n\nI tried Wealthfront and moved my money back as soon as it cleared - it just didn’t feel as secure as SoFi.\n\n## Comment ID ldx7da5 with +6 score by [(LiechsWonder, Reddit, 2024-07-19)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1e70nxm/why_so_many_issues_with_sofi/ldx7da5/) (in reply to ID 1e70nxm):\nIt has generally worked well for me across the products I’ve used since first refiing student loans with them.\n\nI’ve had a couple of issues with them in the past, but nothing that wasn’t eventually resolved, and nothing that was severe enough to cause me to switch to a different financial institution.\n\nThere are definitely some features, especially on the invest side that they still need to roll out in my opinion.\n\nI still have a local credit union, but I do not keep the majority of my financial activity in there.

Or different savings account with a different branch?  The interest with Sofi seems tempting, rather not go with a .01% like chase saving account.

Chase is very dated and won't reward you at all for being active or a long term customer. Sofi builds a good relationship with you by rewarding you for using the features. I've had ally as a savings account for a long time, and I'd compare SoFi to them. It's just SoFi is more new and hip.\n\n I had chase for over 20 years back when it was Washington mutual. Did all my banking with them for years. 2 mortgages, numerous car loans. And the last mortgage I went with them, there was literally no benefit for me being a long term customer. They even acted like they didn't know how much I had in the bank accounts with them. \n\nBrick and mortar banks are dead in my mind.  They are def needed for certain customers. Last time I was there I saw a family checking their safety deposit box, a old man not understanding anything, a foreigner that didn't understand how banks work, and a homeless person arguing that they had money in their account and it's wrong that it shows they don't.

I still have my account with my local credit union where I keep most of my checking and then I moved my savings to Sofi. The one issue is that look into the transfer logistics of your local bank. Mine is smaller so Sofi doesn’t have Plaid set up which means I can’t easily move funds from Sofi back. I have instead requested checks from Sofi to just pay myself when I need to move funds back. Also, my credit union caps daily external transfers at $1,000 and monthly totals at $5,000. So when I initially moved my savings from the credit union to Sofi I again used a check made out to myself as it was easier. It’s still worth it though because I was making literal Pennie’s on my savings at my credit union and I love the vaults.

One extreme edge case I just experienced through sofi was that I needed to put a swift code in for an international transfer from an airline because they overbooked my flight.

I started up a chat and the automated system gave me a toll free number to call.  I asked the nice lady if SoFi Expedia does any price matching and she told me no (in a more polite manner).  The hotel I am staying at is $80 cheaper per night on Priceline for the exact room as on SoFi Expedia.  Granted, I get extra discounts as a Priceline VIP, which I think everybody becomes,  But SoFi needs to get competitive.

I regularly had to make calls that I knew were bad because we weren’t allowed time to properly do research. The company wouldn’t even pay for a backup IP search tool and we were stuck using whatever we could find on the internet. In the last year, SoFi seemed to be moving backwards in terms of progress and job quality. Not forwards. RTO, removal of development opportunities, lower raises, downsizing, etc all makes the company seem less like a FinTech and more like it was trying to be a bank. Which it didn’t know how to do yet.",

Regardless of what their code of conduct says, they will and they have allowed workplace bullying/harassment. In my experience I had a C suite leader belittle me and be demeaning throughout my tenure. Multiple times I had witnesses, and on more than 1 occasion they spoke to HR to place a complaint about his behavior. I also placed several complaints myself with my business partner. The feedback was always the same, he’s being coached. The behavior got so bad that it reached employee relations. Regardless of my evidence and witness accounts, the employee relations person stated: “I believe everything you’ve shared with me within the last 3 weeks. I am aware that this employee does have this history”. She even went and shared her own personal experience about this C suite leader. Yet, she concluded the investigation by stating that bullying isn’t illegal, and therefore they can’t do anything, and any disciplinary action cannot be shared. In an effort to protect myself, I recorded this conversation and also 5 team meetings/1-1’s with my Manager. I figured if HR wasn’t going to protect me, I needed to have this evidence for reference. He never took accountability for his actions, if anything, the investigation made things worse and I had to go back and share evidence of retaliation. The poor behavior by this leader was documented and witnessed by people team employees and across other departments. Yet nothing was ever done. The abuse continued. I’m no longer with SoFi. Yet, I will always remember how unfair I was treated and the hostile work environment brought on by this leader.\n\n“Facts do not seize to exist because they’re ignored.”",

While we are glad you enjoyed the people and benefits and felt your compensation was adequate, we are disappointed to hear you didn't experience a good work-life balance, as we strive to provide an environment that supports this. We are continually working to improve our processes and provide resources to help employees manage their work effectively and efficiently. As you know, one of our core values at SoFi is \"Take Care of People and Help Them Grow,\" so we appreciate you sharing that you would have preferred a different on-call rotation. We hope you shared your concerns with your manager or PBP during your time here. We have grown a lot over the last few years, partly because of the acquisitions we have made, which we believe were the right decisions to ensure SoFi's continued success. Like many companies over the past year, we have not been immune to small reductions in our workforce - these extremely difficult decisions are not taken lightly. If you would like to continue the conversation, I welcome an email to glassdoor@sofi.org. Best of luck in your next career endeavors.",

We have ambitious goals of becoming a top 10 financial institution, but we feel we will still be able to maintain the special sauce that makes SoFi, SoFi.  As you may remember, late last year, we announced our companywide RTO approach focused on flexibility. We do not currently have any plans to change our RTO policy.

I spent more time trying to manage the toxicity in the organization than actually able to do the work I was interested and hired to do. Ultimately I was pushed out of the organization after a very long career of being an overachiever in every other place I’ve worked.

You will always be just another number to them no matter how much they throw around and showcase their values. Prime example is the recent layoffs that happened. No warning and no real empathy given. The leader on the zoom was reading a script and they cut off access within minutes without any management reach out. \n\nTraining -Complete mess and have trainers who have not even done the actual job they are training on.

We're sorry to hear you feel our values are not genuine, we have been very intentional about weaving our values into everything we do - from our onboarding programs, to our value of the month programming, to our performance process, and our recognition tool. We wish you the best in your next endeavor. Thank you again for the time you spent at SoFi, take care.",

I am aware that this employee does have this history”. She even went and shared her own personal experience about this C suite leader. Yet, she concluded the investigation by stating that bullying isn’t illegal, and therefore they can’t do anything, and any disciplinary action cannot be shared. In an effort to protect myself, I recorded this conversation and also 5 team meetings/1-1’s with my Manager. I figured if HR wasn’t going to protect me, I needed to have this evidence for reference. He never took accountability for his actions, if anything, the investigation made things worse and I had to go back and share evidence of retaliation. The poor behavior by this leader was documented and witnessed by people team employees and across other departments. Yet nothing was ever done. The abuse continued. I’m no longer with SoFi. Yet, I will always remember how unfair I was treated and the hostile work environment brought on by this leader.\n\n“Facts do not seize to exist because they’re ignored.”",

      "# [SoFi Blog: Tips and News— for Your Financial Moves](https://www.sofi.com/blog/)\nWe closed out 2023 on a high note by debuting SoFi’s first comprehensive ESG report which captured our efforts throughout 2022. Today, we’re proud to share that our ESG Committee, which is made up of 10 SoFi stakeholders who represent key areas of our organization–including facilities, people, financial reporting, and others – has finalized our second annual ESG report. The 2023 ESG Report, tracks our progress across environmental, social, and governance programs while also collaborating to devise and execute strategies for future impact.\n\nThe report aims to provide stakeholders from across the SoFi community – from members, to investors, partners, and others – with a data-driven look at our stance on ESG matters today, while also providing a baseline that will be key to tracking progress over time. Programs reviewed include initiatives driven by our People team (e.g., benefits, diversity, equity and inclusion, compensation, our approach to talent and employee development, etc.) – as well as our product development processes, community investments and social impact, our environmental footprint, corporate governance strategies, risk management operations, public policy initiatives, and more.\n\nWe are excited to share the 2023 report with you today and continue to bring each of you along with us as we enter the next chapter in our endeavor to foster a better tomorrow.\n\nContact Information: For general inquiries about SoFi’s ESG strategy or upcoming report, please reach out to [email protected], and for investor-specific questions, [email protected].\n\nRead more\n\nWe’re thrilled to share some exciting news: SoFi has been named on Forbes’ Best Workplaces for Women! A true testament to our commitment to fostering an inclusive, supportive, and empowering environment for all employees, this recognition is especially meaningful to me, not just as SoFi’s Chief People Officer – but on a personal level, too.\n\nThis recognition, conducted annually by Forbes in partnership with market research firm Statista, celebrates the top 400 companies in the nation that excel in creating equitable environments for women in the workforce. This exciting acknowledgment is a testament to our ongoing efforts at SoFi to empower women and cultivate a culture that’s dedicated to the success, growth, and overall well-being of everyone. In other words: the best part of my job at SoFi!\n\nBut the reason I feel particularly proud of this is not just about my current role at SoFi. As a woman who’s spent 20+ years working in tech, finance, and healthcare, I am genuinely proud of the collective “us.” In addition to the progress we’ve made at SoFi, I’m deeply inspired by how far the broader workforce has come since I started my career, which is right around the same time I started my journey as a mom. This intersection of life milestones – though not easy at the time – has truly fueled my ambition to give all that I can as a mom while also bringing my best self to work each day.\n\nIn addition to reflecting on my own journey, today’s recognition from Forbes gave me a chance to reflect on the ways we’ve evolved – and are continuing to evolve – at SoFi to be part of the solution. Here are a couple of recent highlights that stood out to me and helped us secure a place on the coveted list:\n\nEmployee Resource Groups\n\nSoFi proudly sponsors nine Employee Resource Groups, known internally as SoFi Circles. These groups build high-trust, functional connections that help our organization thrive. They also foster a sense of belonging, drive innovation and help create bridges of connection and intersectionality. The SoFi Circles and their defined missions and while all employees are encouraged to join any Circle they feel aligned to, we see our female employees engaging most with two in particular:\n\n• Women@SoFi— Mission is to build a safe space for female-identifying employees and allies to connect across SoFi to promote the advancement and inclusion of women. We’re looking forward to taking this engagement to an even deeper level in the coming months as we plan to offer smaller group sessions – based on various levels within the organization to create space for meaningful conversations at specific levels (e.g. senior leaders, people managers, etc.).\n\n• Parents@SoFi— the mission of Parents@SoFi is to support current and future parents at SoFi. This is something I would’ve loved to have had access to when I was starting my journey as a working mom, which is part of the reason I stepped into the role of executive sponsor for this group which aims to create an environment where people with shared experiences can connect and help each other have both a successful career at SoFi and a rewarding family life.\n\nFace of Finance\n\nIn addition to building internal programs to support women, we’ve dedicated resources to external initiatives that aim to empower all women, as well. Our Face of Finance campaign was launched in an effort to bring attention to AI bias and present a new narrative around women’s financial successes. Our talented in-house team created a video revealing the bias that exists in current algorithms and successfully recast women in a more accurate light, depicting the image of wealth and fiscal responsibility that so many women work so hard to achieve. But our video was just the beginning. We enlisted the help of some of social media’s most influential women to help us retrain AI by using their images, so that it could better reflect the truth about women and money. In addition to having a positive external impact – with more than 81M impressions and a 42% surge in unaided awareness – the Face of Finance video also served as an excellent source of engagement internally as well, bringing employees together around a concept we all feel passionate about.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs I look to the future – both as a SoFi leader and a woman in the workforce – I know the best is yet to come. I’m looking forward to continuing to work with our team to bring solutions that empower women – and all employees – to collaborate across our organization in a way that allows them to unlock their potential and offers both clarity and purpose in the work they do everyday.\n\nRead more",

      "# [The pet I’ll never forget: Sofi the dog, who single-handedly lifted me out of my depression by Guardian staff, Lou Olivier on 2024-01-22](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/22/the-pet-ill-never-forget-sofi-the-dog-who-single-handedly-lifted-me-out-of-my-depression)\nSofi appeared in 2006 after my marriage fell apart. I hadn’t had a dog since I was a child and really had no interest. It was a lot of work, I thought, and when you’re depressed – as I was – that’s the last thing you want in your life.\n\nMy 13-year-old daughter, Annie, knew better, though. We – I – needed a dog. “Let’s just go and look at these eight-week-old snowball puppies,” she said. “We don’t have to take one – just look.”\n\nThose “snowball puppies” turned out to be American eskimos – the kind of dog they had rolling on balls in circuses. Sofi was the runt of the litter, a ball of white fur you could not see in the snow. Annie said she would take care of her. Good intentions, I’m sure – but we both knew this would be my dog in the long run.\n\nIn the years to come, I would learn why people have such an affinity with dogs. They don’t offer you anything tangible, serve up great conversations or make your life easier. No, they’re your connection with the universe.\n\nSofi single-handedly lifted me out of my depression, accomplishing what therapists, family and friends could not by absorbing how I felt and letting me know it was OK to feel those things. When I was uptight, she was tense. When I was sad, she stared at me quietly – for as long as it took to comfort me. At those times she would not leave my side unless someone took her away. Her amazing presence represented all the mysterious strength the universe had at its disposal. I had never experienced anything like it, and I doubt I ever will again.\n\nShe still found time to be silly. She would leap high in the air to snatch a stick from your hand, and even higher to snag a Frisbee out of the air. She spent her summers playing dangerous games with bees and, despite her thick coat, lying baking in the sun and hiking with us. And nothing compared with the pure natural beauty of watching her sprint down a beach or across a field. She spread her goodwill to everyone she met, unless you were wearing a hat.\n\nShe was 14 when a routine checkup revealed that she didn’t have long to live. Time to say goodbye so she would not suffer. For the next two weeks we basked in her company and spoiled her silly. Years of memories flooded by, the funny and incredible experiences, and all of the lives Sofi had affected positively. I felt I was dealing with it stoically. Until that day came.\n\nThe veterinarian apologised as Sofi needed a third needle to make the drugs work. Sofi wasn’t having any of it. She didn’t want to leave me alone, to leave me behind. She refused to even lie down. She looked at me and said she was going nowhere, at least for a few more minutes. To Sofi it had never been about being my dog. From day one it had been her task to watch over me. An act of grace.",

He said city officials worked with festival organizers between Saturday and Sunday to find ways of alleviating the problem, which primarily focused on certain \"bass frequencies.\"\n\n\"These frequencies can be affected by stage position, reflection off of buildings and atmospheric conditions including wind,\" Bass wrote in a statement. \"City authorities engaged the event promoter and the venue and implemented several critical adjustments to each stage and established enhanced monitoring plans for overall sound and bass levels. Additional sound engineers were strategically positioned in areas of concern from Saturday afternoon through Sunday and were promptly dispatched to make necessary adjustments in real time.\n\n\"As a result, a significant decrease in call volume was observed on Sunday in the initially impacted areas,\" he said. \"However, some areas continued to experience bass vibrations. Moving forward, and with the lessons learned the past weekend, we are prepared to better monitor and supervise future event organizers to minimize the sound and vibration impact on the community outside the venue.\"\n\nThe Hard Summer festival featured four outdoor music stages positioned outside SoFi Stadium, located mainly in the surrounding parking lots.",

Its offerings include personal loans, student loans, home loans, and various investment services, including SoFi Invest, a mobile-first investment platform [(Yahoo Finance, October 2, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOFI/).\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, SoFi employs approximately 4,400 full-time employees and has a market capitalization of around $8.304 billion [(Yahoo Finance, October 2, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOFI/). The company has reported a revenue of $2.34 billion for the trailing twelve months, although it has also posted a net loss of $153.23 million [(Yahoo Finance, October 2, 2024)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOFI/).\n\n## Recent Developments\n### New Product Launches\nOn October 2, 2024, SoFi announced the launch of its Directed Share Platform (DSP2.0) in collaboration with PrimaryBid Technologies. This platform aims to streamline equity program management for companies looking to raise capital in the U.S., allowing them to allocate shares to employees and individual investors more efficiently than traditional investment banks [(Reuters, October 2, 2024)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SOFI).\n\nAdditionally, SoFi is piloting two new invitation-only credit cards: the SoFi Everyday Cash Rewards Credit Card and the SoFi Essential Credit Card. The Everyday Cash Rewards Card offers 3% cash back on dining, 2% on groceries, and 1% on all other purchases, while the Essential Card is designed for members looking to improve their credit without hidden fees [(SoFi Blog, July 31, 2024)](https://www.sofi.com/blog/sofi-everyday-cash-rewards-sofi-essential/).\n\n### Partnerships\nIn April 2024, SoFi partnered with the National Association of Realtors (NAR) to provide exclusive rates and discounts on various financial products for NAR members and their clients.

Jim Cramer has expressed bullish sentiments, suggesting that the recent rate cuts could benefit SoFi's lending business, which has been growing at a slower pace [(CNBC, October 1, 2024)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SOFI). However, some analysts have raised concerns about the company's performance in the AI sector, labeling it as one of the \"worst AI stocks to buy\" according to Reddit sentiment [(CNBC, October 1, 2024)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SOFI).\n\n## Conclusion\nSoFi Technologies, Inc. is a rapidly evolving fintech company with a diverse range of financial products and a growing user base. While it faces challenges in profitability and market perception, recent product launches and strategic partnerships may position it for future growth. Investors and prospective candidates should consider both the opportunities and risks associated with SoFi as it navigates the competitive landscape of digital financial services."
