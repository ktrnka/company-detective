      "# [SoFi Candidate Resource Website](https://sofietyinfo.sofi.com/interviews)\nMedito Meditation\n\nInterviewing can be stressful and there’s no better way to calm your nerves than to take a deep breath and re-center yourself. Our favorite way to do this? Take a pause via the Medito website and app - we’re big fans of the Work Life Meditation and Walking Meditation.\n\nThe best thing about Medito? It’s free!\n\n2. Practicing to Make Perfect\n\nDifferent companies or organizations may use different platforms to host the interview—from Zoom to Google Hangouts to other programs. You don’t need to become an expert in these features but, it’s a good idea to become comfortable at:\n\n• Using the video software, download and try it out well before the actual call.\n\n• Dialing in to scheduled calls\n\n• Checking the audio and the camera\n\n• Understanding what the interviewer can see\n\nYour Story\n\nRecruiters are looking for someone who is living a purpose-driven life and who wants to work at their specific company for a real, heartfelt reason. This is why it’s powerful to start your pitch off with one or two sentences that paint a picture of a deeper meaning to why you are there. This can connect to a defining moment in your life that influenced your career path or helped you make a career pivot.\n\nYour Cuff\n\nIt’s important to take a moment to address any spots in your resume or job history that may leave recruiters with questions - it should be brief and “off the cuff.” Perhaps you have a gap on their resume, you are transitioning out of industries, or you’re trying to leave a job they just started. Interviewers may wonder about something in your application, but instead of asking about it, they will give you the opportunity to address it. So use the cuff to clarify what you think needs explaining, and do it quickly!\n\nYour Golden Skill\n\nRecruiters are hiring for a particular role, so it’s important you share a skillset applicable to the role at hand. This can be a testimonial from your boss or a colleague who has given you praise for that one golden skill and presents it in an honest and not overly boastful way. If you aren’t sure about your strongest skill set, ask the people you work closely with for their insight.\n\nYour Goal\n\nAt this point you’ve shared a bit about your career journey so it’s important to highlight your goal to get the job. You’ll want to speak to the importance of the company’s mission and how that relates to you and the work you would do in this role.",

      "# [SoFi Has Been Named a 2023 Best Place to Work by Built In by Kari Scheidt, Talent Brand @ SoFi, Kari Scheidt, Talent Brand @ SoFi on 2023-01-11](https://sofietyblog.sofi.com/builtinbest-2023)\nAt SoFi, we are committed to creating a culture where our employees can thrive so they can fulfill our company mission of helping our members achieve financial independence. That’s why everything we do – from building our employee programs, benefits and perks - is centered around what our people need to bring their best selves to work everyday. So when we are recognized by our peers, like digital fintech community, Built In, as being a 2023 “Best Place to Work” it shows that we are moving in the right direction, on a path to building a world-class culture that attracts and retains the best talent.\n\nWe are honored to be named a 2023 Best Place to Work on the following Built In awards:\n\nSan Francisco Best Large Places to Work - #16\n\nSan Francisco Best Places to Work - #41\n\nSeattle Best Large Places to Work - #4\n\nSeattle Best Places to Work - #7\n\nUS Best Large Places to Work - #41\n\nTo be named alongside so many other industry-leading companies is humbling. We have ambitious goals at SoFi – we’ve set out to change the way people think about and interact with personal finance. We’re a next-gen personal finance company, utilizing innovative, mobile-first technology on a mission to help our over four and a half million members reach financial independence to realize their ambitions.\n\nThis journey starts with being deeply committed to our mission - we’re proud to come to work every day knowing that what we do has a direct impact on people’s lives, with our 11 core values guiding us every step of the way. For example, our Value of the Month programming highlights one of our 11 core values (December is dedicated to all 11!) and offers both in-office and virtual programming to bring it to life. From learning sessions with industry thought leaders and experts, to monthly contests, recognition opportunities, and more, there is something for everyone.\n\nWe truly believe that our people are our greatest differentiator – if we take care of them, they will take care of our members. So, we take a holistic approach to employee wellbeing, offering a wide range of benefits and programs that support our people; including: our low-to-no-cost medical plans, mental health services through a partnership with Modern Health, family planning benefits, caregiver leave, gym & wellness programs, and more. Additionally, we want to help our employees achieve financial independence, just like our members, so we contribute $200 per month toward their student loans to help pay down debt—plus free financial classes. To address burnout employees were feeling from working from home throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we created SoFridays, where exempt employees can start their weekends at 2 p.m. every Friday, all year.\n\nAdditionally, our new employee wellness program, SoFi Cares, focuses on how our employees can be their best selves in and out of the office. This includes guided meditations, catered lunch, and other experiences for employees to take care of themselves and connect with others – virtually and in person.\n\nWhen the global COVID-19 pandemic forced companies to shift to full-time remote work, SoFi also had to adapt. What started as a temporary work-from-home environment has shifted to a flexible approach to work. Why? Because flexibility is no longer a nice to have; it’s a non-negotiable for employees. Our Chief People Officer, Anna Avalos, recently told Built In, “We know that the work environment – and employees’ needs – are going to continue to evolve, so we make sure that we are regularly listening to our employees and adapting our offerings to their needs.” That’s why we now offer flexible work environments in which each employee works with their manager to pick the setting that best works for them: in-office, hybrid or full-time remote.\n\nWe believe that in order to help employees manage work and life, we have to meet them where they are and give them the flexibility to bring their best selves to work every day. This includes ensuring that remote employees have the same high-quality experience over Zoom as those employees who go into the office. For example, our regular All Hands meeting with CEO Anthony Noto (unique to the industry) is Zoom-first to ensure all employees get the same access and overall feel. This is the same with external speakers and other company-wide programming. For those events that are in-person, such as volunteering, we ensure remote employees have access to a similar, virtual experience with the same organization.\n\nBut don’t just take it from us – our employees are sharing what they think makes SoFi a 2023 Built In Best Place to Work:\n\nPatrick F., Senior Copywriter, San Francisco:\n\n“SoFi is leading the charge in a category that our members genuinely care about—because we get to impact how they save, spend, and borrow money. While the rest of the industry is spiraling out of control from overpromises and reckless growth, SoFi is steady at the wheel showing the world what fintech can really do.\n\nPlus, SoFi is contradictory in all the best ways. It's big, but it feels small. Leadership is world-class, but approachable. Work-life balance is figured out, but not at the expense of career growth. The people are smart, but kind.”\n\nKrista A., Senior Site Lead, Salt Lake City:\n\nAfter over 5 years with SoFi, I am still regularly being challenged and continuing to grow in my role. With my manager's support and the greatest team I've ever been a part of, I feel like I am doing my best work.\n\nWant to shape a brighter financial future with us?

      "# [SoFi GROW: Mentoring Excellence by Aly Wangerin, Talent Brand @ SoFi, Aly Wangerin, Talent Brand @ SoFi on 2023-06-27](https://sofietyblog.sofi.com/sofi-grow-mentoring-excellence)\nIn the fast paced and dynamic world of fintech, SoFi is always seeking innovative ways to help our employees thrive — one of which is our SoFi GROW mentorship program. GROW helps develop SoFi’s underrepresented minorities and groups (URMs and URGs) through professional mentorship by pairing these future leaders with senior employees at the company to provide real-time feedback, active coaching, key business knowledge, and advocacy to support their professional journeys.\n\nMeet Carlos Bravo and Nikhil Agarwal, recent GROW participants! Nikhil is a Senior Staff Software Engineer and Carlos is currently a Senior Software Engineer, and Nikhil mentors Carlos through SoFi GROW. We had the opportunity to catch up with them to discuss their experience in the program and find out what they think makes SoFi a great place to work!\n\nWhat inspired you to participate in GROW?\n\nCarlos (mentee): Every manager I’ve ever had has told me that they had a mentor. I joined GROW because I thought it would be extremely valuable for me to have a person other than my direct manager who I could go to for career advice! After learning about the program at SoFi, I decided to jump right into it and knew that it would be great for my personal development.\n\nNikhil (mentor): I am extremely grateful to the mentors and coaches who have helped shape my career. After I read about the GROW program, I knew I wanted to give back and share my knowledge and experiences with fellow colleagues who are in the early stages of their career. GROW—like any mentoring program—is a two-way street, and I am proud to say that I have been able to learn a lot from Carlos’ experiences as well.\n\nTell me about a benefit at SoFi that you utilize to its full potential, professional development or otherwise.\n\nCarlos: I would say the Udemy for Business courses! We are able to take any online course on the platform and learn new skills. Additionally, although I haven’t used it myself, I also know that SoFi encourages additional continuing education by providing tuition reimbursement.\n\nNikhil: I really enjoy the flexible time off benefits we have at SoFi, which help us recharge and rejuvenate. This helps a traveler like me to explore new places/experiences and come back supercharged. Additionally, SoFridays allows eligible full-time employees to start their weekends early, every Friday at 2pm local time!\n\nWhat is your favorite part about working at SoFi?\n\nCarlos: I would say the people at SoFi make this company. Whether in the office or remote, everyone is super kind and ready to help at the drop of a hat. The tools and resources at our fingertips are unmatched and we are able to communicate in real time with people who really want to help you grow!\n\nNikhil: I also agree that the people at SoFi make it a very special place to work. Everyone is empathetic and kind in their interactions with their colleagues and coworkers. This fosters a very friendly and collaborative environment in the company.\n\nTell me about the most valuable thing you’ve learned from your time in GROW!\n\nCarlos: My time in GROW has helped me develop better organizational and presentation skills as well as setting up my SMART goals. With the guidance of Nikhil, I am able to strive for excellence by gaining tips about how to properly present to my teammates, or setting up my professional goals.\n\nNikhil: As a GROW mentor, I believe that everyone has the potential to GROW to their fullest, sometimes it just requires a gentle nudge.\n\nOne last question, just for fun: What would the title of your autobiography be and why?\n\nCarlos Bravo: “Personal Growth”\n\nI have grown a lot within the SoFi Grow mentorship. It has opened up my growth mindset and I truly believe this mindset aligns with a lot of our SoFi Core Values. For example, “Set ambitious goals, be gritty, be accountable”, “Get to the truth”, and “Learn, Innovate, Iterate”! I’m very grateful for this opportunity, and my goal is to one day become a great mentor like Nikhil.\n\nNikhil Agarwal: “Just Getting Started…”\n\nEvery day I feel I have new heights to climb, impossible things to solve and too far to drive. I am just getting started and gearing up for the long journey!",

A part of that is looking for a high yield savings account. I keep seeing Sofi pop up. If you use it, I would be very grateful to hear what you have to say about it. Any pros and cons, are there any fees, minimums, time to transfer, etc.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID khdpanj with +24 score by [(DeathMoJo, Reddit, 2024-01-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/khdpanj/) (in reply to ID 1944r8o):\nI been using SoFi as my primary back just over 2 years now. I also have their credit card and utilize the relay service offered.\n\nIn 2 years I haven't had any major issues with them. \n\nPros:\n- Interest rate is competitive (I utilize a money market for a little more long term money, the cash in savings at SoFi is emergency funds).\n\n- Paycheck via direct deposit always on time (2 days early but sometimes was early as 6 days).\n\n- Customer service was super helpful for placing a long-term alert (traveling overseas for a few months). With that, received a few notifications to ensure it was me making the transaction, which is fine. Card worked in multiple countries with no issues minus the occasional fraud check stated. \n\n- Vaults is a solid idea. I like being able to visualize and setup with each paycheck to move amounts for items. I have it set for travel, insurance and taxes.\n\n- Relay is nice to put all my accounts together in one place to see my net worth.\n\n- I enjoyed the 1 year 3% cash back on the credit card, 2% after the promo. I use the SoFi card as our default fall back for anything that doesnt have a higher reward with another card.\n\nEDIT: - The Overdraft protection to pull from savings to checking is nice for auto payments. I keep all money in the savings to maximize interest.\n\n- Rewards are super easy to redeem and clearly spells out how much you will get and gives you options. I had no issues racking up a years worth (wanted to see how much we actually accumulated) and then requested a credit toward the credit card. Posted in 2 days against the card and reduced that month's auto payment amount.  \n\nCons:\n- the investment section is coming along but still well behind on options and features of bigger investment firms. The 2% IRA bonus is nice right now but compare rates of their funds if you are looking long term. \n\n- No physical branch. Obvious one but if you needed a cashier's check, you would need to wait. I'd suggest a local credit union for cash deposits and any in person needs. \n\n- Credit card payments take a day or two to reflect the balance removed from my SoFi bank account. Kind of annoying but I can live with it. \n\n- Personal checks take 4-5 days for funds to be available. Not a huge deal for me but I know some enjoy the instant availability other banks offer. \n\nOverall, it's been simple and easing using their services. As long as that system continues for me, I'll continue to use SoFi.\n\n### Comment ID l7j93kj with +1 score by [(Shot_Net_2457, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/l7j93kj/) (in reply to ID khdpanj):\nHey you \nIt’s been a while I hope you see this.

Most of my direct deposit goes to SoFi with a small portion to the \"big bank\" checking account. All my bills and credit card payments come straight out of the SoFi HYSA account.\n\nThis has worked out well for nearly a year, I get the benefit of the good APR on most of my money and it works out because SoFi allows unlimited transfers.

I like their vault system so I don’t have to actively track allocations of savings myself. \n\nI use Amex Gold and a Hilton honors card for my daily expenses and pass my bills through my Amex Platinum so I steadily gain points as I go about life.

There's nothing \\*wrong\\* with USAA's banking platform - solid bank, but not much in incentives to stay there. Interest rate sucks (like it does with most brick & mortars), no great features, etc.\n\nI checked Ally and then heard about SoFi. Overall, I was more impressed with SoFi's features vs. Ally. The big feature that made me switch was NOT the APY (which I think was 4% at the time) - it was their Vaults feature (Ally has something similar called \"Buckets\".)\n\nBasically, it lets you create sub-accounts inside of your savings account called Vaults. This lets you earmark your cash for a specific goal or purpose. I've wanted a feature like this for close to a decade. \n\nVaults, along with some slight modifications to my financial decisions, suddenly made managing my money significantly easier than it's ever been. \n\nBecause Vaults are inside the Savings account, they also qualify for the higher APY as well.\n\nIf you have overdraft protection, you need to keep money in your actual savings account, because it will not automatically pull money out of any of your Vaults to cover an overdraft. You can transfer money between any of your SoFi Checking, Savings or Vaults instantly, so it's quick and easy to use.\n\nYou also have a feature called Autopilot, which can automatically transfer money from an incoming direct deposit, and auto send to the account or Vault of your choice. Makes it very easy to save money towards goals without having to think about it.\n\nI've been extremely happy with their service and have been with them now for a little over half a year.\n\n## Comment ID khhx8ol with +3 score by [(Kravos76, Reddit, 2024-01-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/khhx8ol/) (in reply to ID 1944r8o):\nMy usage of this service was purely to store a profit from a home sale and let it sit for the high yield savings benefit (along with direct deposit of 200/mo) from my employer. \nFast forward to purchasing a new home many months later and needing to wire transfer from SoFi to the title company…\n\nCaution:  if you need to do any wire transfers  - NOT AN ACH - but a real wire transfer; it’s not easy.

They’re similar in almost every way with a few exceptions. Sofi has a higher APY with 4.6% and Capital One is at 4.35%. Sofi has vaults and CO allows you to open up to 20 different savings accounts which is pretty much the same thing. You can invest through Sofi but not CO. Sofi allows you to track other bills and accounts with different banks CO doesn’t. SoFi requires direct deposit to get the higher APY but it’s not a requirement for CO. Things like cashier checks, Venmo and making big purchases like a big down payment for a car are just easier with CO. I’m not sure if these are available with Sofi yet. Both are fee free banking and anything that Sofi falls short on can be covered by Capital One. I suggest using both.

I put over $1000 er month in direct deposit to take advantage of all features including overdraft. You can literally direct deposit ANY amount to get 4.6% but you’ll need $1000 or more for overdraft. How do I use overdraft? I keep ZERO in checking and ANY amount that draws from checking gets pulled from savings. I love the 2% credit card. I love the points from the various activities. I love the vaults. I named a vault truck payment and my paid off truck payment amount automatically dumps in there when my deposit hits and earns the same 4.6%. I have a couple investments in SoFi invest simply to try it out. Transfer times are very quick and my amount limit to transfer is insanely high. Although I don’t know the exact number. ATM fees are zero when you use AllPoint ATM locations which you can find on the app. The only thing I will not do is mobile deposit because I have heard negative things have happened to people. I keep a local credit union to deposit any cash. I always recommend a local fee free bank in addition.

OK, say I put $60K into a savings account. At 4.6% APY, at the end of a calendar year I should have earned $2760 in interest made. If I divide that sum by 12, it amounts to $230 a month. Beginning after the first month after opening my account (my $60K's been in the savings account for 1 month already) would my $60,000 be up to $60,0230. And if I withdraw the $230 (move it over to checking), could I continue to do that every month? This of course assumes that the At 4.6% APY remains the same (SoFi says it's been stable for 2 years)\n\nI have contacted them directly and am waiting on a clear answer, but if anyone has real world experience regarding my subject, I'd love to hear it.\n\nThank You!\n\n## Comment ID khezrc3 with +1 score by [(Nuclear-Fat-Man, Reddit, 2024-01-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/khezrc3/) (in reply to ID 1944r8o):\nLook into Wealthfront, I use them and they’re great.

I've also had zero issues with their customer service - the few times I've actually needed to use it. They've always been professional, friendly and helpful. \n\nOne feature I always wanted (that I didn't know anyone offered until I started checking other banks out) is a \"sub account\" in the savings account - similar to SoFi's Vaults or Ally's Buckets. USAA doesn't offer it, and it seems like such a no-brainer of a feature to have - set aside money for different goals in the same account - see the total, but also see that your money is split up for different things - massive win for me.\n\nI've come to realize that as much as I like USAA for all their services, they're just falling behind. I would have never considered switching away from them for car insurance - been with them 23 years on my own policy, and before that with my parents. \n\nBut I see SoFi offers car insurance too, so hey, may as well get a quote, if nothing else. See if they really can beat a company I've had almost a 25 year history with.\n\nI'm keeping my USAA credit card - don't want to lose over a decade of history. Doesn't have great cash back, but it IS good for when I travel internationally. No FTF, good travel benefits like accident insurance, trip cancellation and a couple of other perks.\n\nBack to SoFi - I've been reading a lot of reviews, watching a lot of Youtube reviews...the only thing I think I \\*don't\\* know at this point - do they actually offer checks with the checking account? None of the Youtube reviews have mentioned it one way or another. I know we don't use checks much anymore, but I'd kind of like to at least have a book or two of them just in case.\n\nAbout to go check out their website, and probably sign up either tonight or in the morning.\n\n### Comment ID jqhxydt with +6 score by [(rebel_dean, Reddit, 2023-07-03)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/14owun8/goodbye_usaa_hello_sofi/jqhxydt/) (in reply to ID jqh7wr6):\nSoFi has free checks.

On the \"Full View®\" home page, click \"Organizer\" above the welcome message\r  \n3. From the \"Organizer\" page, click \"Accounts\" on the left side and click the blue \"Add Accounts\" button in the top right\r  \n4. Select \"I have an online login to this account\" to begin the search. You may have to try a few different keyword searches. If you find the proper connection, click it to start the connecting process.\r  \n\r  \nIf you do not see the correct institution available when attempting to connect an account, the alternative would be to add the card manually. To do so, go back to the \"Add Accounts\" page, but this time click \"I don't have an online login to this account.\" Follow the account set-up to complete the process.\r  \n\r  \nIf you decide to go this path, please know that your manual accounts must be updated by you. To perform a manual account update, use these steps:\r  \n\r  \n1. Starting on the \"Home\" page of Full View®, identify the manual account and click on it\r  \n2. On the \"Account\" page, click the \"Edit\" button\r  \n3. Make the appropriate changes, then click the blue \"Save\" button when finished\r  \n\r  \nYou can read more about linking a bank to Full View® by checking out the link below. \r  \n\r  \n[Full View®](https://www.fidelity.com/what-we-offer/planning)\r  \n\r  \nIf we can help with anything else, please let us know.

My understand is: for plain set up (account username and password), if you have anything change (password change) or some website change, ACH transfer may not work, you may need to set up plain again. While routing number and account number setup is reliable for long term.\n\nBut you can use Plain to link external account to Relay Insight, it is for viewing external account balance/activities, not for ACH transfer. This has nothing to do with ACH transfer.\n\nFor ACH transfer, you will need to add it as external account, either by routing number/account number or by plain.

Plaid is preferred, I think they allow greater same day funds availability. But you can add up to 2-3 accounts manually (I forget if it’s 2 or 3 manual links) (manual being account /RTN). To link an account manually, allow the plaid box to open and type “manually” - select cancel when your bank doesn’t come up. Follow the prompts to link an account manually.

      "# Post ID 1fcphqp: Alternatives to SoFi?  with +16 score by [(fishpocketz, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1fcphqp/alternatives_to_sofi/)\nI’ve truly been SoFi’s #1 soldier for years and years at this point, but I am consistently running into bizarre issues with my banking that SoFi seems to always be the weakest link in. I’ve been hunting down my measly ‘23 tax return since January, with about a dozen calls to the IRS, multiple traces, etc. I’ve been repeatedly told this is on SoFi, and when I called their customer service over using their live chat, I was screamed at by the associate insisting it wasn’t sofi’s fault. \n\nI’m currently 3ish weeks into a sizable-to-me balance transfer away from my SoFi card to Discover, all of which went smoothly— except for SoFi not registering the balance transfer as completed, leading me to now be that amount *more* in debt, and it considerably crushing my credit score. I’ve initiated a trace with SoFi, again, but im really not optimistic. I’m only a couple of weeks into this process, and discover is my next contact. \n\nI’m just honestly very very tired with this. I have a very simple income, one source, direct deposit, one tax form, etc, truly nothing fancy. No stocks, a couple credit cards that I have 100% payments on and manage decently well. These things shouldn’t be happening to me constantly. \n\nI adore the product, but SoFi is consistently coming up the weakest link when I have issues. Is there anything similar? I know I can’t really get that APY many other places that *arent* HYSA, but there has to be something. I adore Relay, I adore and see a ton of productive use out of Vaults, I adore my 3% credit card, and I really do love the customer service availability. Surely by now someone has to have emulated this elsewhere for a simple checking and (ideally) vaulted savings? \n\nAll input is genuinely appreciated here. Thanks!\n\n## Comment ID lma5x1x with +18 score by [(NefariousnessHot9996, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1fcphqp/alternatives_to_sofi/lma5x1x/) (in reply to ID 1fcphqp):\nWealthfront\n\n### Comment ID m9y2mgk with +1 score by [(UrBoiJash, Reddit, 2025-01-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1fcphqp/alternatives_to_sofi/m9y2mgk/) (in reply to ID lma5x1x):\nNo joint checking features means it’s no good for me\n\n#### Comment ID m9y4jra with +1 score by [(NefariousnessHot9996, Reddit, 2025-01-30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1fcphqp/alternatives_to_sofi/m9y4jra/) (in reply to ID m9y2mgk):\nYea.

While the APR on CapitalOne’s savings account is slightly lower (currently 4.25% vs. 4.5% with SoFi), it’s a more established bank with modern technology that rivals SoFi’s.\n\nUS Bank could be another viable option, offering up to 4.1% on savings (though this requires a $25K+ balance).\n\nYou might also consider the BofA + Merrill Edge combo. While BofA doesn’t have great savings account rates, you could invest in TTTXX through Merrill Edge and potentially earn 5%+ with the added benefit of state and local tax savings. The downside is that it requires manual management, as you’ll need to handle fund purchases and sales yourself, and there’s no overdraft protection.\n\n### Comment ID lmay1vl with +1 score by [(igcetra, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1fcphqp/alternatives_to_sofi/lmay1vl/) (in reply to ID lmawkh7):\nAre there fees to Cap1?\n\n#### Comment ID lmbbsgm with +5 score by [(TheSan92, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1fcphqp/alternatives_to_sofi/lmbbsgm/) (in reply to ID lmay1vl):\nNo, in fact, since Covid they don't even have the per month limitations on savings to checking transfers that some banks still apply (usually like 6 per month).  So you're able to transfer money back and forth between checking and savings as necessary.\n\nWhile they don't have buckets or vaults for savings, it's like a 10 second process to open additional (easily nicknamed) savings accounts (up to 25), since it's all pre-filled as a current customer.\n\nThe current rate on savings accounts is 4.25%, and there's no direct deposit requirement or minimums or anything of that nature on their checking (the checking rate, however, is only .10%).  You can have your payroll check direct deposited to checking and setup auto transfers to immediately send to one or more savings accounts as you wish.  \n\nAlso to note, while Cap1 doesn't have branches everywhere, they do at least exist if you need them.  They also have cafes in several larger cities with banking abilities.  The other useful part is that you can deposit cash easily (if needed) and FREE at Walgreens, CVS and Duane Reade by just giving a deposit barcode from your app to an associate (up to $999 5 times a month).  Most Allpoint ATMs (once again, at Walgreens/CVS/Duane Reade) also allow cash deposits at their ATMs as well, and obviously ATM withdrawals are free there (and thousands of other places) as well.\n\nFinally, even if you have multiple checking/savings accounts, it's all on one consolidated statement (broken down by account) at the end of the month.  Oh, and if you need it, Zelle exists (and always works too).\n\n#### Comment ID lmazdnk with +1 score by [(odin888, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1fcphqp/alternatives_to_sofi/lmazdnk/) (in reply to ID lmay1vl):\nNo fees or minimal balance requirements\n\n## Comment ID lma15i2 with +14 score by [(altboyjunkie, Reddit, 2024-09-09)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1fcphqp/alternatives_to_sofi/lma15i2/) (in reply to ID 1fcphqp):\ni recently transferred from SoFi to Fidelity.

They’ve got their strengths and weaknesses. I absolutely love SoFi’s rates and their app is fairly intuitive if you’ve got sight (I’m blind for reference and some things do not work), but the push notifications are fantastic. Ally is on par with SoFi as far as the accounts go. Buckets are the same as vaults although you do not need a checking account to get a savings account as you do with SoFi. Capital One is solid as well. Their app is sleek and modern. It doesn’t have as many savings tools as SoFi or Ally but definitely a solid contender if you’re looking for alternatives. I also forgot to mention that ally did not provide early deposit for my paycheck as the other 2 did although your experience may differ. Just my thoughts.

I’m not a sofi user but I’m here because I got a text message from a legit-looking scam and wanted to confirm that that’s what it was in case someone was using my info to create an account.\n\nUnless you’re a cybersecurity expert and willing to sacrifice your quality of life for information security, profiles of your info already exist on the internet. Emails and IP texts are super cheap, so some phishing scams don’t care if your info was pulled from a specific company or service… they’ll just cast a wide net pretending that everyone is a customer, knowing that those who respond probably are customers. Then, even if they don’t successfully scam you, they’ll sell your packaged info to other scammers along with the information that you responded to or clicked on the initial attempt at contact. Other more targeted scam specialists will then use that purchased information to, (potentially in this case) target you with more sofi scams.\n\nThat’s how ‘leaks’ can appear to happen despite companies adamantly insisting they weren’t hacked. Sometimes it’s a real hack and the company is incompetent or lying, but often it’s a mass sale of fished data, in much the same way that aboveboard companies occasionally exchange legally obtained CRM sales data.\n\n## Comment ID jjtovmn with +7 score by [(divsandpremium50, Reddit, 2023-05-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/13f2o6e/almost_fell_for_sofi_scam/jjtovmn/) (in reply to ID 13f2o6e):\nMan they got me with this same thing, luckily I’m fine and sofi reimbursed me the charges.

They even spoofed the number so it matched Chase’s 800 number on my caller id. I had a weird feeling about the guy calling, so I just told him it was a bad time, and that I would call Chase back in an hour. He was very insistent I stay on the phone with him, and that’s when I knew. I hung up, called Chase and they confirmed no one on their end had contacted me.

About 3 years ago i opened account with CapitalOne online Banking with a small amount of my paycheck going via direct deposit no issues ever.  I have no use for BoA have not walked into a branch for anything other than to get an emergency debit/visa card a few times when i lost mine over the years. Their interest rates suck and there really is no reason for me to have my money there at all other than that legacy security and name.  With that said im ready to make the jump to another \"cloud\" banking alternative and close down my BoA account but a few questions ..\n\n1) does it matter anymore in credit checks / getting loans etc how long your bank account has been opened?  \n\n2)Does SoFi pull money from your legacy bank per say ? Example if i try to send money from BoA to Capital one Checking or Savings they want to charge a fee but i can pull the money from BoA using my COne accounts to deposit for free.\n\n3)Is it as simple once my account is open i can just \"pull\" all my funds to SoFi and close my BoA accounts online? (pending of course taking care of any recuring payments etc)\n\nI'm sure i have a few more questions but these are the primary ones that are on my mind before opening. .. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n\n## Comment ID kgqdcwg with +31 score by [(edapalooza, Reddit, 2024-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/190saak/move_from_brick_and_mortar_to_sofi/kgqdcwg/) (in reply to ID 190saak):\nI keep a brick-and-mortar for those emergency times I need a little bit of quick cash, but everything else goes into SoFi.\n\n### Comment ID kgr1gng with +4 score by [(Dense-Strategy-1450, Reddit, 2024-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/190saak/move_from_brick_and_mortar_to_sofi/kgr1gng/) (in reply to ID kgqdcwg):\nCame here to say this.

I have most of my stuff thru SoFi but have these other banks in case I need something where I need to go into bank or I’m traveling or SoFi doesn’t have something at this point.  Credit cards thru Chase and BofA\n5.  This is my story and it works for me🤔. I know what I’m getting from each bank and how I’m using them.

Because a lot of these banks don’t have a great option for depositing cash and other features can sometimes be limited also. \n\nSo for me, I picked up a local CU account years ago where I keep a couple of paychecks worth of cash on the off-chance that my SoFi account ever gets frozen for any reason.

Or you can always divert a smaller portion of your direct deposit there and make Sofi your hub.\n\nOr sometimes they waive all fees when your balance is above X including investments which means Merrill Lynch brokerage with those funds could work.\n\nLastly, BofA does have a rewards program which gives you higher cashback on your CC based on total balance with the firm (including investments) which is pretty popular.\n\nI recommend switching, but think you may be able to keep some benefits of BofA on the side.\n\n### Comment ID kgrhey6 with +3 score by [(donatom3, Reddit, 2024-01-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/190saak/move_from_brick_and_mortar_to_sofi/kgrhey6/) (in reply to ID kgraf3l):\nI do the smaller direct deposit with Chase.

They refused to overnight my card and it took around 30 days to get my debit card. Their chat support was also rude. Fast forward to March 17th, I get in contact with SoFi to despite a charge from a company that charged me without my knowledge. The chat representative specifically said that I wouldn’t have to get a new card and that “he took care of it.” Now on March 24th I find my card doesn’t work. Turns out they lied and did actually deactivate my card and again refuse to overnight a card to me even after their screwup and the chat representative was rude and condescending. Plus their Zelle implementation is garbage too, always fails when I send money and can’t even use Zelle’s app because SoFi blocks it. Save yourself the headache and choose another service.",

I’ve had SoFi installed for a week and used it for about an hour and have experienced just as bad service as the old CU. 3.something percent in savings never compensates for lousy service and services.

Eventually I started getting emails (with no links) saying I needed to sign my application and do other tasks to complete my account. I couldn’t find these tasks on my profile ANYWHERE. I’ve been using computers my whole life and could not figure out where to go. I eventually emailed the help desk and never got a response. Decided to close my account and open one with WeBull. Wasn’t even 12 hours before I completed everything and was trading on their platform. Pretty sad I had these easy fix issues and was met with radio silence considering how big of a company SoFi is.",

The SOFI representatives that I spoke to were very understanding and quickly resolved the issue. I received my card in 2 days at my home. Since switching over to SOFI not too long ago from my credit union, I have had nothing but good representatives helping me. Thank you to everyone that has helped me whenever I have called.

We are also committed to ensuring promotions are conducted in a fair and equitable way. We have a semi-annual performance check-in program to award merit increases and promotions. The program is rooted in our leveling guide, which each employee is evaluated against. We aim to create a consistently positive member experience with every interaction, and in order to do so, we set very specific metrics - all employees are provided and evaluated against. Every employee is held to the same set of metrics, and we strive to give everyone the training and tools they need to meet and exceed expectations. If you have any concerns about the process, we highly recommend you reach out to your People Business Partner (PBP) or your manager - who are here to support your career journey. You can also email us at glassdoor@sofi.org. Thanks for being on this journey with us! Take care.",

Alot of management is fake and pretend to be on your side but will throw you under the bus at any moment. \n\nGrowth- they promise growth and all these opportunities but it's just a smoke screen to make it seem like you have an opportunity so you stay. \n\nManagement\n\nFake values- At the end of they day they are a corporate bank. You will always be just another number to them no matter how much they throw around and showcase their values. Prime example is the recent layoffs that happened. No warning and no real empathy given. The leader on the zoom was reading a script and they cut off access within minutes without any management reach out. \n\nTraining -Complete mess and have trainers who have not even done the actual job they are training on. So if you like being thrown it to fully do your job with a fraction of the knowledge needed to do it. This would be for you. \nThis company used to care but unfortunately you are just a number. \n\nThe other reviews about management are spot on.",

I spent more time trying to manage the toxicity in the organization than actually able to do the work I was interested and hired to do. Ultimately I was pushed out of the organization after a very long career of being an overachiever in every other place I’ve worked.

I understand employee engagement and satisfaction is most easily measured by surveys and survey participation, but insisting everyone participates in an \"optional\" survey tells you less, and worse, potentially tells you the wrong things. You'll receive junk responses that have to be sifted through resulting in wasted staff hours, and many will be indistinguishable from honest feedback, simply for appearances. There will also be false positive answers from people who don't want to actually engage with the task; all ratings 5/5 with no substance. Additionally, measuring how many people fail to participate is *also* a key metric for employee engagement and satisfaction. More or less demanding feedback doesn't work in your favor.\n\n2. Please reassess how you reassess non-exempt wages. I know we have someone monitoring fair market wages in all locations, and while I can't speak for others, I don't feel like it's worked for me. I'm being forced by economic pressure into looking for openings with other companies that might compensate me more generously, and I don't want to. I really don't want to. I absolutely love working at SoFi, but my hand is being forced, and I don't think I'll be able to resist the financial tide much longer.\n\n3. Though the 2 hours paid self-guided training is very much appreciated, it is not enough to make any new knowledge really stick. This can be overcome by employees continuing these courses off the clock, which is fine, but without setting that expectation, I do not believe the company is getting a good ROI. I believe that either providing slightly more paid hours more frequently or specifically encouraging employees to finish courses outside scheduled hours will lead to better outcomes. In either case, a low cost incentive for completed courses might be a good idea, but particularly in the latter.",

          "cons": "1. Feedback is valued so much that it's practically compulsory. I don't always have something to say, but I feel more or less forced to think of something for the quarterly surveys, even if its relatively inconsequential.\n\n2. Average cost of living in my city has outpaced my wages by ~6% over the last 4 years, while my rent alone has gone up ~11.67% while remaining below the median.\n\n3. Slow downsizing followed by COVID resulted in the closure of the CA operations office. Although this means I'm now fully remote (which is nice), advancement opportunities are significantly limited by location requirements, which is discouraging. This could be a factor for new hires who are fully remote.\n\n4. Rapidly increased outsourcing of lower operations roles, particularly customer service. The company insists onshore jobs are secure, but it's very hard to trust that completely.\n\n5. In spite of a focus on employee development, additional training in my role has been sparse. There are very good reasons for this, not the least of which is upheaval caused by promoting from within (which is a good thing overall). However, it is still an opportunity for improvement.\n\n6. No 401k match, and I haven't received RSU's since my original grant when hired, all of which vested years ago. This is probably not true for employees outside support roles, but I don't really know.",

My favorite is: \"Do the right thing. If you’re not sure, do the harder thing.\"\n\n3. Surprisingly less evil than most finance companies, with a focus on member success. When I was in a customer \"facing\" role, I always felt like advocating for the consumer was both welcome and desired.\n\n4. In the last few years, the company has shifted to a strong emphasis on employee development and internal promotion. I have two hours of paid time per month to work on external skills training (formerly Udemy, now through LinkedIn).\n\n5. CEO has placed a focus on developing excellent corporate culture from day one (early 2018).\n\n6. Medical benefits are above average. Other myriad benefits are available with varying cost reductions, but the free Gympass (now Wellhub) membership and discounts for family members are a nice bonus.\n\n7. DEI is strong in multiple ways. SoFi accommodated my disability with no fuss or pushback, and there was no underhanded reprisal like being flagged as a \"problem employee\" who needs to be \"managed out of the business\" with excessive criticism and documentation of every possible perceived failure. *I cannot emphasize enough how valuable that is.\n\n8. Depending on your location and role, many positions are fully remote or on a 2:3 hybrid, including low level operations employees.\n\n9. Unless in a rigidly scheduled role, like customer \"facing\" roles, schedules are very flexible when needed. I've split my shift for a medical appointment on several occasions.\n\n10. Good amount of PTO for hourly employees with modest increases every year to year 6 (I believe). Exempt (salaried) employees have essentially unlimited PTO within reason, as long as business continuity is maintained.\n\n11. SoFi recognizes that good ideas come from all levels. First hand insight is valued, and appropriately escalated to stakeholders. That's not true for many companies, where lower tier employees are essentially told to leave thinking to the almighty middle management.",

You will always be just another number to them no matter how much they throw around and showcase their values. Prime example is the recent layoffs that happened. No warning and no real empathy given. The leader on the zoom was reading a script and they cut off access within minutes without any management reach out. \n\nTraining -Complete mess and have trainers who have not even done the actual job they are training on.

        "advice": "*Criticisms aside, I think management is doing a great job, overall.\n\n1. I understand employee engagement and satisfaction is most easily measured by surveys and survey participation, but insisting everyone participates in an \"optional\" survey tells you less, and worse, potentially tells you the wrong things. You'll receive junk responses that have to be sifted through resulting in wasted staff hours, and many will be indistinguishable from honest feedback, simply for appearances. There will also be false positive answers from people who don't want to actually engage with the task; all ratings 5/5 with no substance. Additionally, measuring how many people fail to participate is *also* a key metric for employee engagement and satisfaction. More or less demanding feedback doesn't work in your favor.\n\n2. Please reassess how you reassess non-exempt wages. I know we have someone monitoring fair market wages in all locations, and while I can't speak for others, I don't feel like it's worked for me. I'm being forced by economic pressure into looking for openings with other companies that might compensate me more generously, and I don't want to. I really don't want to. I absolutely love working at SoFi, but my hand is being forced, and I don't think I'll be able to resist the financial tide much longer.\n\n3. Though the 2 hours paid self-guided training is very much appreciated, it is not enough to make any new knowledge really stick. This can be overcome by employees continuing these courses off the clock, which is fine, but without setting that expectation, I do not believe the company is getting a good ROI. I believe that either providing slightly more paid hours more frequently or specifically encouraging employees to finish courses outside scheduled hours will lead to better outcomes. In either case, a low cost incentive for completed courses might be a good idea, but particularly in the latter.",
        "cons": "1. Feedback is valued so much that it's practically compulsory. I don't always have something to say, but I feel more or less forced to think of something for the quarterly surveys, even if its relatively inconsequential.\n\n2. Average cost of living in my city has outpaced my wages by ~6% over the last 4 years, while my rent alone has gone up ~11.67% while remaining below the median.\n\n3. Slow downsizing followed by COVID resulted in the closure of the CA operations office. Although this means I'm now fully remote (which is nice), advancement opportunities are significantly limited by location requirements, which is discouraging. This could be a factor for new hires who are fully remote.\n\n4. Rapidly increased outsourcing of lower operations roles, particularly customer service. The company insists onshore jobs are secure, but it's very hard to trust that completely.\n\n5. In spite of a focus on employee development, additional training in my role has been sparse. There are very good reasons for this, not the least of which is upheaval caused by promoting from within (which is a good thing overall). However, it is still an opportunity for improvement.\n\n6. No 401k match, and I haven't received RSU's since my original grant when hired, all of which vested years ago. This is probably not true for employees outside support roles, but I don't really know.",
        "lengthOfEmployment": 6,
        "pros": "1. Feedback is valued so much that it's practically compulsory.\n\n2. Company \"lives\" by its core values. They don't feel like hollow ideals we never deliver on. My favorite is: \"Do the right thing. If you’re not sure, do the harder thing.\"\n\n3. Surprisingly less evil than most finance companies, with a focus on member success. When I was in a customer \"facing\" role, I always felt like advocating for the consumer was both welcome and desired.\n\n4. In the last few years, the company has shifted to a strong emphasis on employee development and internal promotion. I have two hours of paid time per month to work on external skills training (formerly Udemy, now through LinkedIn).\n\n5. CEO has placed a focus on developing excellent corporate culture from day one (early 2018).\n\n6. Medical benefits are above average. Other myriad benefits are available with varying cost reductions, but the free Gympass (now Wellhub) membership and discounts for family members are a nice bonus.\n\n7. DEI is strong in multiple ways. SoFi accommodated my disability with no fuss or pushback, and there was no underhanded reprisal like being flagged as a \"problem employee\" who needs to be \"managed out of the business\" with excessive criticism and documentation of every possible perceived failure. *I cannot emphasize enough how valuable that is.\n\n8. Depending on your location and role, many positions are fully remote or on a 2:3 hybrid, including low level operations employees.\n\n9. Unless in a rigidly scheduled role, like customer \"facing\" roles, schedules are very flexible when needed. I've split my shift for a medical appointment on several occasions.\n\n10. Good amount of PTO for hourly employees with modest increases every year to year 6 (I believe). Exempt (salaried) employees have essentially unlimited PTO within reason, as long as business continuity is maintained.\n\n11. SoFi recognizes that good ideas come from all levels. First hand insight is valued, and appropriately escalated to stakeholders. That's not true for many companies, where lower tier employees are essentially told to leave thinking to the almighty middle management.",

If you wish to participate in any Referral Program described below, you agree to the terms for such Referral Program described in Part I below, as well as the General Terms and Conditions in Part II, which apply to all Referral Programs.\n\nPlease note that any friend whom you’d like to refer must use your specific product referral link in accordance with the terms and conditions associated with the specific promotional campaign for that link. By clicking “Share Link” and sharing your link with your friend, you agree that you have express consent to send your friend promotional messages about SoFi’s products and services. Note you have separate referral links for (1) Personal Loans and Student Loans, (2) Checking and Savings accounts, or (3) Invest products, or (4) Credit Score Monitoring. Only one referral reward and one welcome bonus per new customer, with the exception of referrals for new closed end unsecured installment loans. You will not receive multiple referral bonuses for the same friend taking advantage of multiple promotions, nor will your friend receive multiple welcome bonuses for taking advantage of multiple promotions unless they are for a new closed end unsecured installment loan that your friend has not previously obtained. You will receive an additional referral bonus for the same friend funding a new personal loan, new student loan refinance or new private student loan, provided the friend applies through the specific product’s referral link and has not previously obtained that type of closed end unsecured lending product. Employees of Social Finance, LLC and its affiliates are not eligible to receive referral bonuses under the Referral Programs.\n\nEach person referred should be someone you have a direct, personal relationship with. You may not distribute a Referral Link or otherwise solicit anyone through mass email, any form of commercial advertising or other similar means.\n\nSoFi reserves the right to review, investigate, and disqualify anyone from participation in the SoFi Referral Program at any time, and reserves the right to not honor any referral which in our sole discretion was solicited in a manner inconsistent with the spirit or terms and conditions of the SoFi Referral Program.\n\nFurthermore, SoFi Securities reserves the right to seek reimbursement from any customer (including by deduction from their Invest Account) of amounts paid as Referral Bonuses to customers solicited via mass solicitation. Please note that in certain circumstances the deduction of such amounts from their account may result in a negative balance.\n\nAny person referred to a SoFi loan or SoFi Checking or Savings account may not have an existing registered SoFi account. Any person referred to Credit Score Monitoring may not currently have another SoFi product but may already have a registered SoFi account. A person referred to a SoFi Invest account may have an existing SoFi account.\n\nIf account funding is required to meet referral bonus payout eligibility, P2P transfers or proceeds of a reward, promotion or similar program are not eligible methods of funding.\n\nTo protect the privacy of those you refer, referral prospect account information or eligibility is not, under any circumstances, permitted to be shared with referral promoters.\n\nReferral Program — Part I\n\nLoan Referral Program\n\nThe terms below and those set forth in Part II govern your participation in SoFi Bank, N.A.’s (“SoFi Bank”) Loan Referral Program (the “Loan Referral Program“) described below. The Loan Referral Program is open to any consumer who registers on SoFi’s website and who resides outside of the state of Vermont (the “Eligible Loan Referrer(s)“). Employees of Social Finance, LLC and its affiliates are not eligible to receive Loan Referral Bonuses under the Loan Referral Program.\n\nEligible Loan Referrers are limited to refer friends, colleagues, family members, and other people they (collectively, the “Eligible Loan Recipient(s)“) believe may be interested in applying for a student loan or personal loan product as described in a specific promotional campaign (collectively, the “Eligible Loan(s)“). SoFi Bank reserves the right to disqualify anyone from participating in the Loan Referral Program at any time. The Eligible Loan Referrers will NOT receive a Loan Referral Bonus for referrals for any other SoFi Bank loan products. Anyone who violates these terms and conditions is ineligible for payment of any bonus.\n\nTo receive credit for a referral under the Loan Referral Program, Eligible Loan Referrers must send their unique referral link to an Eligible Loan Recipient, the Eligible Loan Recipient must use their Eligible Loan Referrer’s unique referral link within 120 days after receipt of the Eligible Loan Referrer’s unique referral link, and the Eligible Loan Recipient must meet the terms and conditions of the specific promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral. Further, in order for the Eligible Loan Recipient to receive their Loan Welcome bonus for a SoFi Personal Loan, the loan must still be an active loan in good standing ninety (90) days after the disbursement date. For Private Student Loan referrals, the Eligible Loan Recipient and Eligible Loan Referrer will receive their bonus sixty (60) days after their first loan disbursement, and the Eligible Loan Referrer is eligible for a maximum of 5 total referral bonuses for the Private Student Loan product. Further, for referrals for the Private Student Loan product no payments will be made if the Eligible Loan Referrer is employed by a qualified educational institution. If the Eligible Loan Recipient uses the Eligible Loan Referrer’s unique referral link and meets the terms and conditions of the specific promotional campaign associated with that unique referral link, SoFi Bank or its designee shall pay to (a) the Eligible Loan Referrer, a referral bonus into a SoFi Bank Checking or Savings account in the amount specified in the promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral (the “Loan Referral Bonus“); and (b) the Eligible Loan Recipient, a welcome bonus into a SoFi Bank Checking or Savings account in the amount specified in the promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral (the “Loan Welcome Bonus“). Only one Loan Referral Bonus and one Loan Welcome Bonus will be awarded for each referred Eligible Loan Recipient, regardless of whether the Eligible Loan Recipient takes out multiple Eligible Loans. Further, and notwithstanding the above, the following additional restrictions shall apply (1) no Loan Referral Bonus will be paid to otherwise Eligible Loan Referrers who are residents of Vermont, and (2) no Loan Referral Bonus will be paid for otherwise funded loans made to Vermont residents. An Eligible Loan Referrer will not earn a Loan Referral Bonus if the Eligible Loan Recipient has or had an existing funded SoFi loan account, or if the Eligible Loan Recipient does not use the unique referral link provided by the Eligible Loan Referrer.\n\nIf the Eligible Loan Recipient already has a SoFi loan account, is on our opt-out list or the national email opt-out list, or has already used another Eligible Loan Referrer’s unique referral link, the Eligible Loan Recipient may not be sent an email. We cannot disclose to you any information about funded loans opened by any Eligible Loan Recipients you refer to us. Participation in the Loan Referral Program serves as a one-time limited waiver of privacy rights by both parties, whereby each may become aware of the presence of an account relationship with SoFi Bank.\n\n$1,000 Medical and Dental Referral Offer: All referral program terms and conditions apply. Offer is subject to lender approval and not available to residents of Vermont.

Bonuses that are not redeemed within 180 calendar days of the date they were made available to the recipient may be subject to forfeit. Bonus amounts of $600 or greater in a single calendar year will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as miscellaneous income to the recipient on Form 1099-MISC in the year received as required by applicable law.

A referrer must have a SoFi Invest account offered by SoFi Securities LLC (either an Automated Invest account or an Active Invest account) which is funded and in good standing (i.e., not suspended) (an “Eligible Invest Referrer(s)”). Employees of Social Finance, LLC and its affiliates are not eligible to receive Invest Referral Bonuses under the Invest Referral Program.\n\nThe Eligible Invest Referrers are encouraged to refer friends, colleagues, family members, and anyone else they believe may be interested in opening a SoFi Active Invest account (the “Eligible Invest Recipient(s)”).

SoFi Securities LLC, or its designee (collectively, “SoFi Securities”) reserve the right to disqualify anyone from participation in the Invest Referral Program at any time.\n\nTo receive credit for a referral made under the Invest Referral Program, an Eligible Invest Referrer must access their own unique referral link and send it to the Eligible Invest Recipient(s) whom they wish to refer to open a new SoFi Active Invest Account (an “New Active Invest Account”). The Eligible Invest Recipient must use the Eligible Invest Referrer’s unique referral link to open a New Active Invest Account within 120 days after receipt of the Eligible Invest Referrer’s unique referral link, and meet the terms and conditions of the specific promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral.\n\nFor each Eligible Invest Recipient who opens and funds a New Active Invest Account within 120 days after receipt of the Eligible Invest Referrer’s unique referral link, and meets the terms and conditions of the specific promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral, SoFi Securities will: (a) credit an Invest account of the Eligible Invest Referrer with a referral bonus in the amount and method specified in the promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral (the “Invest Referral Bonus”); and (b) credit the New Active Invest Account of the Eligible Invest Recipient, with a one-time welcome bonus in the amount and method specified in the promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral (the “Invest Welcome Bonus”).

An Eligible Invest Referrer will not earn an Invest Referral Bonus if the Eligible Invest Recipient has or had an existing funded SoFi Invest account or does not use the unique referral link provided by the Eligible Invest Referrer.\n\nPlease note that if the Eligible Invest Recipient already has an Invest account, is on our opt-out list or on the national email opt-out list, or has already used another Eligible Invest Referrer’s unique referral link, SoFi Securities will not send an email to such Eligible Invest Recipient. We cannot disclose to you any information about New Active Invest Accounts opened by any Eligible Invest Recipients you refer to us. Participation in the Invest Referral Program serves as a one-time, limited waiver of privacy rights by both you and the Eligible Invest Recipient, pursuant to which each may become aware that the other has an account relationship with SoFi Securities.\n\nBank Referral Program\n\nTo receive the promotional bonus, referred participants must (i) apply and successfully open a SoFi Checking and Savings account and (ii) make deposits totaling $50 or more that settle within 21 days of clicking the referral link.

SoFi reserves the right to change or terminate the offer at any time without notice.\n\nCredit Score Monitoring Referral Program\n\nSoFi will give the referrer 1000 rewards points (equivalent to $10) if the referred participant registers to use, and successfully activates, SoFi Credit Score Monitoring within 60 days of you sending the link.

Neither you nor SoFi intend to establish an employment relationship, and you are not entitled to any benefits.

SoFi Plus\n\nLast Updated: March 25, 2025\n\nSoFi Plus is a benefits program (“Plus Benefits Program”) offered by Social Finance, LLC and its affiliates (collectively “SoFi”) that gives SoFi Plus members (defined below) the opportunity to take advantage of various benefits across the SoFi ecosystem.\n\n(a) Eligibility:\n\nSoFi Plus members are defined as customers who meet either of the following eligibility criteria:\n\n(i) Customers of SoFi Checking and Savings, which is offered by SoFi Bank, National Association, Member FDIC, who receive Eligible Direct Deposit (defined below and when recognized by SoFi) into a SoFi Checking and Savings account every 30 days. Eligible Direct Deposit means a recurring deposit of regular income to an account holder’s SoFi Checking or Savings account, including payroll, pension, or government benefit payments (e.g., Social Security), made by the account holder’s employer, payroll or benefits provider or government agency (“Eligible Direct Deposit”) via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Network during a 30-Day Evaluation Period (as defined below). Although we do our best to recognize all Eligible Direct Deposits, a small number of employers, payroll providers, benefits providers, or government agencies do not designate payments as direct deposit. To ensure you’re receiving SoFi Plus benefits, we encourage you to check your SoFi Plus status in the Membership & Rewards Center the day after your Eligible Direct Deposit arrives. If your SoFi Plus status is not reflected in the Membership & Rewards Center, contact us at 855-456-7634 with the details of your Eligible Direct Deposit. As long as SoFi Bank can validate those details, you will start receiving SoFi Plus benefits from the date you contact SoFi for the rest of the current 30-Day Evaluation Period. You will also be eligible for SoFi Plus benefits on future Eligible Direct Deposits, as long as SoFi Bank can validate them. Deposits that are not from an employer, payroll or benefits provider, or government agency, including but not limited to check deposits, peer-to-peer transfers (e.g., transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc.), merchant transactions (e.g., transactions from PayPal, Stripe, Square, etc.), and bank ACH funds transfers and wire transfers from external accounts, or are non-recurring in nature (e.g., IRS tax refunds), do not constitute Eligible Direct Deposit activity. SoFi Bank shall, in its sole discretion, assess each account holder’s Eligible Direct Deposit activity to determine eligibility and may require additional documentation to complete this verification. The 30-Day Evaluation Period refers to the “Start Date” and “End Date” set forth on the APY Details page of your account, which comprises a period of 30 calendar days (the “30-Day Evaluation Period”). You can access the APY Details page at any time by logging into your SoFi account on the SoFi mobile app or SoFi website and selecting either (i) Banking > Savings > Current APY or (ii) Banking > Checking > Current APY. SoFi Plus member benefits will be lost during periods in which the customer has turned off Eligible Direct Deposit into their account. If you are a joint account holder of a SoFi Checking and Savings account and either you or your joint account holder receives Eligible Direct Deposit into your SoFi Checking and Savings account, then you will be eligible for all SoFi Plus benefits, including on accounts you hold in your own name.\n\n(ii) Customers who pay the SoFi Plus subscription fee of $10 (the “SoFi Plus Subscription Fee”) every 30 days via the SoFi mobile app. SoFi Plus member benefits will be lost during periods in which the customer has not paid the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee. See section 10(b) herein for the terms and conditions governing the Subscription Fee. If you are a joint account holder of a SoFi Checking and Savings account and only the other joint account holder pays the SoFi Plus subscription fee, then you will receive the high annual percentage yield (“APY”) set forth in Section 10(c)(i) herein, but you will not be eligible for all other SoFi Plus benefits, unless you meet either of the eligibility criteria described in this Section 10(a), or you are also a joint account owner on an account that receives benefits.\n\nYou may only enroll in SoFi Plus if you are legally authorized to accept and be bound by these terms and are of a legal age to enter this Agreement.\n\n(b) SoFi Plus Subscription Fee\n\n(i) Payment Methods: Customers may use the following payment methods to pay the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee.\n\n(1) ACH Transfer from SoFi Checking Account: Customers may pay the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee from their SoFi Checking account. By submitting payment for the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee via the SoFi mobile app, you authorize SoFi to initiate ACH transfers every 30 days to SoFi by debiting your SoFi Checking account for the amount of the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee stated in section 10(a) herein. If we determine that you have insufficient funds in your SoFi Checking account to pay the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee, you will be prompted to add funds to your SoFi Checking account. If you fail to add funds to your SoFi Checking account, SoFi reserves the right to terminate your SoFi Plus benefits.\n\n(2) Credit Card or Debit Card: Customers may pay the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee via credit card or debit card. By submitting payment for the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee via the SoFi mobile app, you authorize SoFi to charge the credit card or debit card entered on the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee payment page every 30 days. If your selected payment method fails, you will not be enrolled as a SoFi Plus member.\n\n(ii) Billing Cycle: Your billing cycle start date is the date on which you click “Join SoFi Plus” in the SoFi mobile app. Upon clicking “Join SoFi Plus,” you will receive an email notification of the start of your SoFi Plus membership. You will also receive an email notification upon SoFi’s receipt of each SoFi Plus Subscription Fee payment.\n\n(iii) Canceling Payments: You can cancel your authorization of future ACH transfers or future credit card or debit card payments at any time by logging into your SoFi account and canceling your SoFi Plus membership on the subscription management page. You must cancel your SoFi Plus membership by 7:59 p.m. P.T. at least one (1) calendar day before the subscription renewal date to avoid being charged the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee for the next billing period. If a cancellation request is submitted after this time, you may be charged for the subsequent billing period. Please note that SoFi will not issue a partial refund for canceling a SoFi Plus membership before the end of a billing cycle. Upon successful cancellation, you will continue to enjoy all SoFi Plus benefits until the last day of your current billing cycle.\n\n(iv) Student Free Trial: Members who sign up for a new SoFi Plus paid subscription with an email address ending in .edu in their SoFi account profile prior to 3/31/2025 at 11:59pm PT will receive their first 90 days of SoFi Plus (the “Free Trial Period”) for $0.00. On day 91 after signup, the provided payment method will be charged $10. You must provide a valid payment method and service will automatically renew every 30 days, unless you terminate your SoFi Plus membership. You must cancel your subscription during your Free Trial Period to avoid charges. If you receive Eligible Direct Deposit to a SoFi Checking or Savings account during your Free Trial Period, you will exit the Free Trial Period and your subscription will automatically be canceled; you will remain a Plus member as long as you continue to receive Eligible Direct Deposit every 30 days. To cancel your SoFi Plus subscription, visit the Subscription Management page of the Membership & Rewards Center. SoFi reserves the right to modify or terminate this promotion at any time.\n\n(v) SoFi Plus Free Trial: Members who sign up for a new SoFi Plus paid subscription between 3/25/2025 at 12:00pm PT and 4/1/2025 at 12:00pm PT will receive their first 90 days of SoFi Plus (the “Free Trial Period”) for $0.00. On day 91 after signup, the provided payment method will be charged $10. You must provide a valid payment method and service will automatically renew every 30 days, unless you terminate your SoFi Plus membership. You must cancel your subscription during your Free Trial Period to avoid charges. If you receive Eligible Direct Deposit to a SoFi Checking or Savings account during your Free Trial Period, you will exit the Free Trial Period, and your subscription will automatically be canceled; you will remain a Plus member as long as you continue to receive Eligible Direct Deposit every 30 days. To cancel your SoFi Plus subscription, visit the Subscription Management page of the Membership & Rewards Center. SoFi reserves the right to modify or terminate this promotion at any time.\n\n(c) SoFi Plus Member Benefits:\n\n(i) 3.80% APY on savings:\n\nSoFi members with Eligible Direct Deposit activity can earn 3.80% annual percentage yield (APY) on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances. Eligible Direct Deposit means a recurring deposit of regular income to an account holder’s SoFi Checking or Savings account, including payroll, pension, or government benefit payments (e.g., Social Security), made by the account holder’s employer, payroll or benefits provider or government agency (“Eligible Direct Deposit”) via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Network during a 30-Day Evaluation Period (as defined below).\n\nAlthough we do our best to recognize all Eligible Direct Deposits, a small number of employers, payroll providers, benefits providers, or government agencies do not designate payments as direct deposit. To ensure you’re earning 3.80% APY, we encourage you to check your APY Details page the day after your Eligible Direct Deposit arrives. If your APY is not showing as 3.80%, contact us at 855-456-7634 with the details of your Eligible Direct Deposit. As long as SoFi Bank can validate those details, you will start earning 3.80% APY from the date you contact SoFi for the rest of the current 30-Day Evaluation Period. You will also be eligible for 3.80% APY on future Eligible Direct Deposits, as long as SoFi Bank can validate them.\n\nDeposits that are not from an employer, payroll, or benefits provider or government agency, including but not limited to check deposits, peer-to-peer transfers (e.g., transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc.), merchant transactions (e.g., transactions from PayPal, Stripe, Square, etc.), and bank ACH funds transfers and wire transfers from external accounts, or are non-recurring in nature (e.g., IRS tax refunds), do not constitute Eligible Direct Deposit activity. There is no minimum Eligible Direct Deposit amount required to qualify for the stated interest rate. SoFi members with Eligible Direct Deposit are eligible for other SoFi Plus benefits.\n\nAs an alternative to Direct Deposit, SoFi members with Qualifying Deposits can earn 3.80% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances. Qualifying Deposits means one or more deposits that, in the aggregate, are equal to or greater than $5,000 to an account holder’s SoFi Checking and Savings account (“Qualifying Deposits”) during a 30-Day Evaluation Period (as defined below). Qualifying Deposits only include those deposits from the following eligible sources: (i) ACH transfers, (ii) inbound wire transfers, (iii) peer-to-peer transfers (i.e., external transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc. and internal peer-to-peer transfers from a SoFi account belonging to another account holder), (iv) check deposits, (v) instant funding to your SoFi Bank Debit Card, (vi) push payments to your SoFi Bank Debit Card, and (vii) cash deposits. Qualifying Deposits do not include: (i) transfers between an account holder’s Checking account, Savings account, and/or Vaults; (ii) interest payments; (iii) bonuses issued by SoFi Bank or its affiliates; or (iv) credits, reversals, and refunds from SoFi Bank, N.A. (“SoFi Bank”) or from a merchant. SoFi members with Qualifying Deposits are not eligible for other SoFi Plus benefits.\n\nSoFi Bank shall, in its sole discretion, assess each account holder’s Eligible Direct Deposit activity and Qualifying Deposits throughout each 30-Day Evaluation Period to determine the applicability of rates and may request additional documentation for verification of eligibility. The 30-Day Evaluation Period refers to the “Start Date” and “End Date” set forth on the APY Details page of your account, which comprises a period of 30 calendar days (the “30-Day Evaluation Period”). You can access the APY Details page at any time by logging into your SoFi account on the SoFi mobile app or SoFi website and selecting either (i) Banking > Savings > Current APY or (ii) Banking > Checking > Current APY. Upon receiving Eligible Direct Deposit or $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits to your account, you will begin earning 3.80% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% on checking balances on or before the following calendar day. You will continue to earn these APYs for (i) the remainder of the current 30-Day Evaluation Period and through the end of the subsequent 30-Day Evaluation Period and (ii) any following 30-Day Evaluation Periods during which SoFi Bank determines you to have Eligible Direct Deposit activity or $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits without interruption.\n\nSoFi Bank reserves the right to grant a grace period to account holders following a change in Eligible Direct Deposit activity or Qualifying Deposits activity before adjusting rates. If SoFi Bank grants you a grace period, the dates for such grace period will be reflected on the APY Details page of your account. If SoFi Bank determines that you did not have Eligible Direct Deposit activity or $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits during the current 30-Day Evaluation Period and, if applicable, the grace period, then you will begin earning the rates earned by account holders without either Eligible Direct Deposit or Qualifying Deposits until SoFi Bank recognizes Eligible Direct Deposit activity or receives $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits in a subsequent 30-Day Evaluation Period. For the avoidance of doubt, an account holder with both Eligible Direct Deposit activity and Qualifying Deposits will earn the rates earned by account holders with Eligible Direct Deposit.\n\nSeparately, SoFi members who enroll in SoFi Plus by paying the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee every 30 days can also earn 3.80% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances.\n\nMembers without either Eligible Direct Deposit activity or Qualifying Deposits, as determined by SoFi Bank, during a 30-Day Evaluation Period and, if applicable, the grace period, or who do not enroll in SoFi Plus by paying the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee every 30 days, will earn 1.00% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances.\n\nInterest rates are variable and subject to change at any time. These rates are current as of 1/24/25. There is no minimum balance requirement. Additional information can be found at https://www.sofi.com/legal/banking-rate-sheet.\n\n(ii) 10% Boost on Cash Back Rewards Points for SoFi Credit Card Purchases:\n\nMembers who meet the eligibility criteria shall earn a 10% boost on cash back rewards rates for all eligible purchases made with a SoFi Credit Card (the “Promotion”). A 10% boost means that a 10% multiplier shall be applied to existing cash back rewards rates (e.g., a purchase previously earning 100 rewards points would now earn 110 with the promotion). For purposes of calculating the 10% boost on cash back rewards points, each transaction shall be rounded to the nearest dollar, and fractional points shall be rounded to the nearest whole point. The 10% boost shall not apply to (i) transactions that are not eligible for cash back rewards points, including: fees or interest charges, balance transfers or cash advances, purchase of traveler’s checks or other cash equivalents, purchase or reloading of prepaid cards, or other quasi-cash transactions; or (ii) courtesy rewards points that are manually awarded. SoFi shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether a transaction is eligible to earn the 10% boost under this Promotion.\n\nTo be eligible for this Promotion, you must be successfully enrolled in SoFi Plus during the Promotion Period. In order to enroll in SoFi Plus and to continue to receive the 10% boost, you must either (i) receive Eligible Direct Deposit during each 30-Day Evaluation Period (as defined below) or (ii) pay the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee every 30 days, as detailed in the SoFi Plus Terms and Conditions. Eligible Direct Deposit means a recurring deposit of regular income to an account holder’s SoFi Checking or Savings account, including payroll, pension, or government benefit payments (e.g., Social Security), made by the account holder’s employer, payroll or benefits provider or government agency (“Eligible Direct Deposit”) via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Network during a 30-Day Evaluation Period. Although we do our best to recognize all Eligible Direct Deposits, a small number of employers, payroll providers, benefits providers, or government agencies do not designate payments as direct deposit. To ensure you’re receiving the 10% boost on cash back rewards points for SoFi Credit Card purchases, we encourage you to check your SoFi Plus status in the Membership & Rewards Center the day after your Eligible Direct Deposit arrives. If your SoFi Plus status is not reflected in the Membership & Rewards Center, contact us at 855-456-7634 with the details of your Eligible Direct Deposit. As long as SoFi Bank can validate those details, you will start receiving the 10% boost on cash back rewards points for SoFi Credit Card purchases from the date you contact SoFi for the rest of the current 30-Day Evaluation Period. You will also be eligible for the 10% boost on cash back rewards points for SoFi Credit Card purchases on future Eligible Direct Deposits, as long as SoFi Bank can validate them. Deposits that are not from an employer or government agency, including but not limited to check deposits, peer-to-peer transfers (e.g., transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc.), merchant transactions (e.g., transactions from PayPal, Stripe, Square, etc.), and bank ACH funds transfers and wire transfers from external accounts, or are non-recurring in nature (e.g. IRS tax refunds), do not constitute Eligible Direct Deposit activity.\n\nThe 30-Day Evaluation Period refers to the “Start Date” and “End Date” set forth on the APY Details page of your account, which comprises a period of 30 calendar days (the “30-Day Evaluation Period”). You can access the APY Details page at any time by logging into your SoFi account on the SoFi mobile app or SoFi website and selecting either (i) Banking > Savings > Current APY or (ii) Banking > Checking > Current APY. Upon receiving Eligible Direct Deposit to your account, you will begin earning the 10% boost on cash back rewards. You will continue to earn the 10% boost for (i) the remainder of the current 30-Day Evaluation Period and through the end of the subsequent 30-Day Evaluation Period and (ii) any following 30-Day Evaluation Periods during which SoFi Bank determines you to have Eligible Direct Deposit activity without interruption. SoFi Bank reserves the right to grant a grace period to account holders following a change in Eligible Direct Deposit activity before terminating your 10% boost benefit. If SoFi Bank grants you a grace period, the dates for such grace period will be reflected on the APY Details page of your account. If SoFi Bank determines that you did not receive Eligible Direct Deposit during the current 30-Day Evaluation Period and, if applicable, the grace period, then you will no longer earn the 10% boost until SoFi Bank recognizes Eligible Direct Deposit activity in a subsequent 30-Day Evaluation Period. In certain cases, it may take up to 90 days for your Eligible Direct Deposit to be recognized, after which you will begin earning the 10% boost on cash back rewards. If you do not see your 10% boost on cash back rewards benefit after 90 days, please contact our help center.\n\nPromotion Period: The Promotion will begin on 4/1/24 at 1:00 PM ET. SoFi reserves the right to terminate or make changes to this Promotion at any time.\n\nEligible Participants: All new and existing SoFi Credit Card members who successfully enroll in SoFi Plus during the Promotion Period are eligible for this Promotion. In order to enroll in SoFi Plus and to continue to receive the 10% boost, you must either (i) receive Eligible Direct Deposit during each 30-Day Evaluation Period or (ii) pay the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee every 30 days, as detailed in the SoFi Plus Terms and Conditions. A member shall not earn the 10% boost under this Promotion if they are currently earning 3% cash back rewards points under the 3% Cash Back Rewards Promotion. If you currently benefit from the 3% Cash Back Rewards Promotion, then you will continue to earn 3% cash back rewards points until you are either no longer eligible or until the expiration of such benefit, as provided in the 3% Cash Back Rewards Promotion terms. Upon the expiration of your 3% cash back rewards points benefit, you will be eligible to earn the 10% boost under this Promotion, provided that you meet the eligibility criteria stated herein. Offer limited to one per SoFi Checking and Savings account. A SoFi Credit Card account will only benefit from the 10% boost under this Promotion if the primary SoFi Credit Card account holder receives Eligible Direct Deposit into their SoFi Checking or Savings account (or, in the case of a joint Checking and Savings account, a joint account holder receives Eligible Direct Deposit). SoFi reserves the right to exclude any member from participating in this Promotion for any reason, including suspected fraud, misuse, or if suspicious activities are observed.\n\n3% Cash Back Rewards on SoFi Credit Card Purchases for 12 months on your SoFi Credit Card:\n\nThe Promotion Period concluded on 4/1/24\n\nYou will need to receive an Eligible Direct Deposit every 30 days into your SoFi Checking or Savings account in order to continue to receive this promotional cash back rewards rate.

If your SoFi Plus status is not reflected in the Membership & Rewards Center, contact us at 855-456-7634 with the details of your Eligible Direct Deposit.

      "# [SOFI TUKKER joins Jermaine Dupri, 40+ creative thinkers at Ideas Festival Emory Sept. 20](https://news.emory.edu/stories/2024/09/er_ideas_festival_dupri_sofi_tukker_05-09-2024/story.html)\nGrammy-nominated genre-defying duo SOFI TUKKER has joined the lineup for the inaugural Ideas Festival Emory, organizers announced Sept. 9. The festival, a celebration of creative minds, is set to take place Sept. 20-22 on Emory University’s Oxford College campus.\n\nThe group, comprising Sophie Hawley-Weld and Tucker Halpern, recently released their third studio album “BREAD.” An acronym for Be Really Energetic and Dance, “BREAD” encapsulates their infectious music, which spreads themes of liberation, unity and self-empowerment. The band has amassed more than three billion streams, earned platinum and gold records on five continents and been featured in several brand campaigns for Apple, Peloton and Smartwater.\n\nAs part of the festival, the duo will speak with Matt Whyte, host of the Sing for Science podcast, which connects musicians with scientists. SOFI TUKKER will chat about bread, the beloved food staple, and the chemistry that makes it so delicious with Maria Ortiz — the food scientist behind the popular Instagram account All You Knead is Bread — on Sunday, Sept. 22 at 4:30 p.m.\n\nHosted by Emory’s Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, the event — which is free and open to the public — also features live music, local food vendors, children’s programming and exhibits. Festival registration is open.\n\nSOFI TUKKER joins the previously announced keynote speaker, renowned rapper, producer and record executive Jermaine Dupri, and more than 40 other speakers at the festival, intended to connect students and the greater community with visionary scholars, creators and thought leaders, including a Pulitzer-winning journalist, transformative business executive, New York Times-bestselling music historian and innovative toy designer.\n\nDuring the festival’s keynote session Friday evening, Dupri, a Grammy Award winner, Atlanta native and founder of So So Def Recordings, will engage in conversation with Whyte and Joycelyn Wilson, assistant professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at Georgia Tech. Through her work as an ethnographer, Wilson has traced the cultural forces that have shaped Atlanta’s unique identity as the thriving epicenter of hip hop and R&B.\n\nDelving into multiple themes\n\nAdditional speaker sessions on Saturday and Sunday will cover an array of themes including science, history, literature, entrepreneurship, music and cinematography and photography. The full schedule and speaker biographies are now available on the newly launched Ideas Festival Emory website.\n\nJust a few of the notable speakers include:\n\nBarbara Kopple, a two-time Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker;\n\nVirginia Willis, a James Beard award-winning cookbook author and chef;\n\nJon Goode, an Emmy-nominated writer whose work has been featured on CNN, HBO and BET;\n\nStephanie Stuckey, board chair of Stuckey’s, the candy manufacturer; and\n\nCarrie Buse, head of design for Mattel’s Future Lab, which focuses on innovative products and play experiences.\n\nThroughout the weekend, Ideas Festival Emory will feature live music and entertainment on the Oxford College quad, photography exhibits and food and drink vendors.\n\nThe event will also include children’s programming and collaborations with local schools. In partnership with the Newton Education Foundation, the Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement will host hundreds of students from Newton County Schools, providing them with a unique learning opportunity to connect with children’s book authors.\n\nThe festival has attracted sponsors committed to engaging individuals and families across the metro Atlanta region in its programming, including Lumina Foundation, WABE, the City of Covington and Rough Draft Atlanta.\n\nKen Carter, Charles Howard Candler Professor of Psychology and founding director of the Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, believes the festival — the center’s flagship event — will be distinctive in its mission to share ideas and spark curiosity with local and global audiences.\n\n“Ideas Festival Emory is a celebration of creativity and innovation, connecting the public with visionary leaders who inspire and challenge us,” says Carter. “We hope the festival will ignite new ideas and inspire meaningful conversations, in an environment that will be fun for people of all ages.”\n\nWhile attendees will engage with and learn from speakers during the sessions, Carter hopes the festival will have an impact that stretches beyond the three-day event. Speaker sessions will be recorded for an upcoming podcast that will help extend the festival's reach and attract curious listeners from around the world.\n\nThe Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, established in 2023, aims to help faculty and students proactively engage in public conversation and increase confidence in the value of scholarship and evidence-based research. With plans to expand its programming and host a Public Scholarship Academy for faculty in May 2025, the center — housed at Oxford College — hopes to establish itself as a novel space where scholars share knowledge and insights directly with the community.\n\n“I’m proud that Oxford College is home to the Emory Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, and we look forward to hosting this incredible weekend of exploration and discovery on our beautiful campus,” says Oxford Dean Badia Ahad.\n\n“Bringing together a diversity of scholars, artists and writers to discuss some of the most pressing and complex issues of our time is particularly important in this cultural moment when we need more and better models of civil discourse, free expression of ideas and constructive dialogue,” Ahad continues. “This perfectly captures the spirit of education and collaboration we embrace here at Oxford and Emory.”",
      "# [SoFi Completes Acquisition of Technisys](https://www.galileo-ft.com/pt/news/sofi-completes-acquisition-of-technisys/)\nSoFi Technologies, Inc. (“SoFi”), the digital personal finance company, today announced the completion of its acquisition of Technisys S.à.r.l. (“Technisys”), a leading cloud-native, digital multi-product core banking platform.\n\nTechnisys adds a unique, strategic technology and business to the SoFi family, bolstering SoFi in its pursuit to provide best-of-breed products as a one-stop-shop financial services platform, and complementing and enhancing SoFi’s Galileo business, in SoFi’s overall pursuit to build the AWS of fintech. The combined Galileo/Technisys technology stack will create what is expected to be the only end-to-end vertically integrated banking technology stack, from user interface development capabilities to a customizable multi-product banking core and ledger with fully integrated processing and card issuing available for SoFi products and Galileo/Technisys partners. The combination of Technisys’ platform with Galileo will uniquely support multiple products – including checking, savings, deposits, lending and credit cards – as well as future products, all surfaced through industry-leading APIs. Together, Galileo and Technisys are expected to enable the combined company to meet both the expanding needs of their existing partners, as well as serve additional established banks, fintechs and non-financial brands looking to enter financial services.\n\nThe acquisition is also expected to add to the high revenue growth rate of SoFi and accelerate its three-year revenue CAGR. Together, the companies can better serve Galileo’s consumer fintech and enterprise partners seeking to add product offerings to their 100 million enabled customer accounts across the U.S., Mexico and Colombia, and Technisys’ more than 60 established bank, fintech and non-financial brands in Latin America and the U.S., while expanding both companies’ partner bases in the U.S. and an addressable market across 16 countries. The estimated incremental revenue from the acquisition, including base revenue of Technisys and revenue synergies of the vertically integrated capabilities, is expected to add a cumulative $500 to $800 million through year-end 2025, at high incremental margins.\n\nSoFi also expects to leverage this modern technology stack to capture significant savings in third-party costs by integrating Technisys. Once SoFi has migrated off its current multiple third-party cores to a single owned and operated Technisys core, it expects to be able to innovate even faster, perform more real-time decisioning, and offer greater personalization for its approximately three and a half million members. SoFi estimates this shift and the vertical integration with Galileo will create approximately $75 to $85 million in cumulative cost savings from 2023 to 2025 and approximately $60 to $70 million annually thereafter.\n\nAbout SoFi\n\nSoFi’s mission is to help our members achieve financial independence to realize their ambitions. Our products for borrowing, saving, spending, investing and protecting give our three and a half million members fast access to tools to get their money right. SoFi membership comes with the key essentials for getting ahead, including career advisors and connection to a thriving community of like-minded, ambitious people.
