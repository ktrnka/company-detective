      "# [Home Mortgage Calculator on 2017-02-28](https://www.sofi.com/mortgage-calculator/)\nWelcome to the SoFi mortgage payment calculator. Whether you have found your dream home or are wondering what your purchase budget should be — or already own a home and are considering a refinance — this calculator will help you determine what your monthly home loan payment will be and how much interest you’ll pay over the life of your loan. Let the number crunching begin.\n\nStep 1: Enter your property value.\n\nUse the value or listed price of your desired home or the current estimated value of the home you wish to refinance.\n\nStep 2: Enter a down payment amount or percent down\n\nEnter a down payment of at least 3%. If you’re considering a mortgage refinance, enter the amount of equity you currently have in your home (subtract the amount you owe on your current mortgage from your home’s estimated current value).\n\nEnter a down payment amount and the mortgage payment calculator will give you the percentage down, and vice versa. So you could also choose to enter a percent down to see what your down payment would need to be. Putting 20% down on a property will allow you to avoid paying private mortgage insurance (PMI), but many homebuyers put down less than 20%, especially if they qualify as first-time homebuyers.\n\nIf you think you will need to borrow more than $766,550 to purchase a home, you’re likely a candidate for a jumbo loan and a lender may require you to put down at least 10%. (Some pricier areas have higher minimums for jumbo loans — enter the zip code of the location you’re shopping in at Fannie Mae’s mapping tool to see the jumbo loan number for your area.)\n\nStep 3: Enter an interest rate.\n\nPlug in the day’s average fixed rate for a 15- or 30-year mortgage, or use the rate a lender has suggested you may qualify for.\n\nStep 4: Choose a loan term.\n\nThe term is the number of years the loan will last. The lower the term, the higher the monthly payment but the greater the savings in total interest paid.\n\nUnderstanding the Results\n\nThe calculator will immediately show the following results:\n\n• Loan amount: This is the amount you would borrow, also known as the principal.\n\n• Monthly payment: This is what you would pay toward the principal and interest each month. Remember that you will also need to pay for property taxes, homeowners insurance, and perhaps homeowners association (HOA) fees and private mortgage insurance (PMI). Some of these costs will be higher or lower depending on the cost of living in your area.\n\n• Total interest paid: This is the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan.\n\n• Payoff date: Here, the mortgage loan calculator shows the day you’d pay off your mortgage unless you refinanced or paid it off early.\n\n• Amortization chart: This chart shows interest paid, principal paid, and the remaining amount of the loan with each mortgage payment. Move your cursor to the right to see how payments are amortized over time. The amortization chart can also serve as a mortgage payment calculator: As you move your cursor you can see how much money would be required to pay off the principal you owe at different times during the loan. If you do want to pay off your mortgage, get the exact amount due from your lender.\n\nBenefits of Using a Mortgage Payment Calculator\n\nMortgages can be complicated, especially if you’re buying your first home, but there are many ways a mortgage payment calculator can help. Playing with different property values can give you a general idea of how a home’s price might impact your monthly payments and what a mortgage loan may cost in total over the life of the loan.\n\nIt’s also helpful to use a home mortgage calculator to compare the monthly payment for different types of mortgage loans (15- vs. 30-year terms). And it’s useful to see how sizing up (or trimming back) your down payment amount might affect your monthly costs. (If you think you might struggle to come up with any down payment at all, there are down payment assistance programs that can help.)\n\nThe only downside of using a mortgage calculator? As noted above, many mortgage calculators don’t include property taxes, homeowners insurance, mortgage insurance, or HOA fees — so they don’t provide a complete picture of the recurring expenses on a property. And of course the numbers you get from a mortgage calculator are only as solid as the numbers you put in: If you put in a low interest rate that you can’t qualify for because of steep debts or a shaky credit history, your actual results in the mortgage market will differ.\n\nFormula for Calculating a Mortgage Payment\n\nThe mathematical formula for a home mortgage calculator is pretty complicated, which is why this calculator is so handy. If you wanted to do the math by hand, your formula would look like the one below. In this example:\n\nM = Monthly mortgage payment\n\nP = Principal (the amount you borrow)\n\nR = Your base interest rate. (Use the base rate, not the APR.) You’ll divide this by 12 because the rate is an annual one and you are solving for a monthly payment amount.\n\nN = Number of payments in your loan term. A 15-year term, for example, would have 180 monthly payments.\n\nM = P [R(1 + R)ⁿ] / [(1 + R)ⁿ − 1]²\n\nDeciding How Much House You Can Afford\n\nUsing a mortgage calculator is one way to begin to get a handle on how much house you can afford. You can also use a home affordability calculator , which will take into account your annual income and debts to generate a maximum home price that would be within your budget.\n\nThere are also longstanding guidelines for homebuyers that can help you determine what you can afford. One is the 28/36 rule, which states that your total mortgage payment, including principal, interest, taxes, and insurance, should not exceed 28% of your gross income, and your mortgage payment plus any other debt payments should not exceed 36% of your gross income. To learn what your monthly limits would be under the 28/36 rule, simply multiply your monthly gross income by 0.28 and again by 0.36.\n\nRecommended: Average Monthly Expenses for One Person\n\nAdditionally, before you settle on a location, do your homework on the cost of living and mortgage rates. It might just surprise you.\n\nCurrent Mortgage Rates by State\n\nHow Lenders Decide How Much You Can Afford to Borrow\n\nThere’s another important calculation involved in the homebuying process: the number-crunching a prospective lender will do to determine the size of loan and terms you might qualify for. Each lender has its own formula, but in general a lender will be looking at your debt-to-income ratio, which is your total debt divided by your total income, shown as a percentage. (Generally, lenders are looking for 43% or less.)\n\nLenders will also examine your credit history, your income history, your down payment amount, and other factors to arrive at whether you are a good candidate for a loan and, if so, what terms you’ll be offered.\n\nWhat’s Next: Get Preapproved for a Mortgage Loan\n\nOnce you’ve used a mortgage calculator to estimate how much you might be able to pay for a house, you can get prequalified for a mortgage with a few lenders to obtain a clearer idea of what interest rate and loan amount a lender might offer you, based on a high-level look at your finances. As you get serious about home-shopping, you’ll want to take the next step and get preapproved for a mortgage with at least one lender.\n\nGoing through the mortgage preapproval process involves a thorough review of your credit and financial history. If you seem to be a good candidate for a home loan, the lender will give you a letter stating that you qualify for a loan of a certain amount and at a certain interest rate. The letter is an offer, but not a firm commitment. It’s typically good for up to 90 days. If you’re competing with other buyers in a hot market, being preapproved for financing will make you more attractive to sellers.\n\nRecommended: Best Affordable Places in the U.S.\n\nComponents of a Mortgage Payment\n\nPrincipal and interest are the foundation of a mortgage payment, and the amount of your monthly payment that goes to each of these expenses changes over the life of the loan, with more of the payment being applied to interest costs early in the life of the loan. As you make payments over the years, more money will gradually go toward paying down the principal.\n\nTypical Costs Included in a Mortgage Payment\n\nPrincipal and interest aren’t the whole story. Maybe you’ve heard of PITI, which stands for principal, interest, taxes, and insurance. Property taxes and homeowners insurance costs can often be rolled into mortgage payments. The money is held in an escrow account, and payments are then made by your mortgage servicer. You can decide whether taxes and insurance become part of your monthly mortgage payment when you choose your home mortgage loan.\n\nTips on Reducing Your Mortgage Payment\n\nAfter you’ve had your home loan for a while, you might be interested in lowering your mortgage payments. One way is to apply any bonus or windfall to the principal. Another option might be to refinance to a lower interest rate. Maybe rates have dropped or your credit score has improved significantly since you bought your home — in this case, a refinance might offer real savings. You can put a lower interest rate into a mortgage payment calculator to see how a refinance would affect your monthly payments and interest paid over the life of a new loan.\n\nAnother way to reduce your monthly payment: If your equity in the home has hit 20% of its original value (the value when you purchased it), you can write to request that your lender cancel PMI. As long as the property has held its value, you have kept current on your monthly payments, and there are no liens or additional mortgages on the home, your request should be granted.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nA mortgage payment calculator can give you an idea of what your monthly mortgage payments would look like based on how much you spend on a house, what size down payment you make, and what interest rate you obtain. It’s also a good way to see how much interest you would pay over the life of a loan. Getting prequalified for a home loan with one or more lenders will give you an even clearer idea. And obtaining a mortgage preapproval will tell you exactly how much you may qualify to borrow from a lender and what your monthly payments might be.\n\nLooking for an affordable option for a home mortgage loan? SoFi can help: We offer low down payments (as little as 3% - 5%*) with our competitive and flexible home mortgage loans. Plus, applying is extra convenient: It's online, with access to one-on-one help.\n\nSoFi Mortgages: simple, smart, and so affordable.\n\nView your rate\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is a mortgage payment?\n\nA borrower makes monthly payments, typically made up of principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and any private mortgage insurance required by the lender. With a fixed-rate mortgage, monthly payments stay the same, but the amount of each payment that is put toward principal vs. interest is divvied up differently over time. A mortgage loan calculator can show what monthly payments would be based on different loan types and interest rates.\n\nHow does my credit score affect my mortgage loan interest rate?\n\nThose with the highest scores get the lowest rates. Even a small increase in rate can make a big difference over the life of a loan.\n\nWhat is principal and interest on a mortgage loan?\n\nThe principal is the amount borrowed. The interest is the price paid for borrowing.\n\nHow much should I put down on a mortgage?\n\nTwenty percent down on a conventional loan is ideal, but most people are not able to come up with that much. Some conventional and government-backed loans allow for low down payments or none at all.\n\nShould I choose a 30-year or 15-year mortgage term?\n\nIf you can comfortably swing the payments on a 15-year mortgage and you have emergency and retirement savings, the shorter loan term could be a smart choice because the total savings in interest will be substantial.\n\nHow can I get a lower mortgage interest rate?\n\nAdvertised rates are often misleading, so shoppers beware. Many house hunters ask for loan estimates from several lenders after applying for a mortgage. Be sure to examine the details and compare apples to apples. There may be room to negotiate with a chosen lender. FHA, VA, and USDA loans may have lower rates than conventional loans (but they require either mortgage insurance or fees).\n\nHow much income do you need for a $400,000 mortgage?\n\nIt would take an annual income of about $130,000 to afford a $400,000 mortgage. If you have significant debts, you might need to earn more.\n\nCan I afford a $300K house on a $70K salary?\n\nOne rule of thumb is that your home’s cost should not be more than three times your annual income. So it would be difficult to cover the costs of a $300,000 house on a $70,000 salary — unless you are able to contribute a large down payment. Use a home affordability calculator to zero in on your personal budget number.\n\nWhat is a livable hourly wage?\n\nThe living wage in the United States is $25.02 per hour, or $104,077.70 per year (before taxes) for a household of two working adults and two kids, according to 2022 analysis from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Living Wage Calculator. This is a national average, and your personal number will depend on costs in your local area and your family size.\n\nYou Might Also Like",

The industry is going through an unprecedented change, and our employees, like Content Writer/Editor Sulaiman Abdur-Rahman, are at the forefront. Sulaiman is here to share how he’s helping to drive the growth of our brand so we can fulfill our mission, all while achieving the work-life balance that allows him to bring his best self to work.\n\nBefore we get started, tell us three things that others may not know about you.\n\nSulaiman:\n\nI hold an Australian Permanent Resident visa;\n\nAt one time, I wanted to be the Anthony Bourdain of New Jersey (my place of birth);\n\nI regularly watch the soap opera General Hospital.\n\nWow, what a variety! And on top of that, you’re a writer who has spent the majority of your career as a freelancer. What made you decide to go ‘in house’?\n\nSulaiman: I’ve held full-time jobs most of my career as a professional journalist, but in my free time I would freelance to build up my experience and supplement my income. I would commit numerous hours toward work and side gigs, often burning the midnight oil. I knew I needed to make a change to provide a better work-life balance, and I’ve been blessed to have the opportunity to join an amazing team here at SoFi.\n\nWe love to hear it - and have seen a lot more research around how finding work-life balance and prioritizing your mental well-being is more important than ever. You decided to join SoFi in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. Other than looking for better work-life balance, why’d you decide to make the jump?\n\nSulaiman: I saw the global COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity for pursuing my personal and professional goals. It was a unique time where workers like myself suddenly had a renewed sense of value. There’s no reward without taking risks, and the tight labor market and so-called ‘Great Resignation’, on top of the new normal of working from home, placed me on an uncharted path that guided me to SoFi. I tell people that having the opportunity to work here in the role that I have as a Content Writer/Editor is an offer I couldn’t refuse.\n\n\"I saw the global COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity for pursuing my personal and professional goals.

Providing Members with insights about personal loans, student loans, and auto loans is a major part of my job as a Content Writer/Editor, as well as enhancing our existing content and contributing ideas for growing our business and brand.\n\nHow have your freelance skills helped you excel in this role?\n\nSulaiman: I believe my freelance skills help me to quickly learn and adapt, which is essential when working for a fast-growing fintech. A big moment for us came when President Biden announced his broad student loan forgiveness plan in August 2022. My skills as an experienced journalist, accustomed to working on tight deadlines, prepared me for that day. Upon hearing the news, I produced an updated Lantern by SoFi student loan forgiveness article and made the necessary updates to other articles on our site reflecting the Dec. 31 payment pause extension.\n\nWorking in coordination with the Content Team, I’ve implemented the urgent updates using our content management system. The other priority I had that week was to draft urgent updates to the following articles: “Can You Get Student Loan Forgiveness if You Refinance?” and “Should I Refinance My Student Loans?” These efforts paid dividends: Lantern’s organic search traffic in August increased by 115% over July, and much of that boost came from a 323% increase in Lantern’s student loan organic search traffic month over month.\n\n\"I believe my freelance skills help me to quickly learn and adapt, which is essential when working for a fast-growing fintech.\"\n\nWhat has surprised you about working at SoFi?\n\nSulaiman: I was surprised by how such a quickly growing company with more than 4,000 employees in our SoFi-ety (our SoFi Society; SoFi-ety! That’s what we call our people) could create such a welcoming and unifying environment for everyone. To see the company executives, especially our CEO Anthony Noto, make themselves visible and regularly accessible while pushing this company forward, I must say that surprised me. I love the All-Hands weekly meeting, and I really feel as if we’re one big family here at SoFi.\n\nYour passion for where we are going is infectious!

      "# [Crypto 101: A Beginner's Guide to Cryptocurrency on 2023-11-16](https://www.sofi.com/crypto-guide/)\nCrypto Basics\n\nWhat Is Cryptocurrency?\n\nCryptocurrency, often simply called “crypto,” is any type of decentralized, digital currency that’s based on cryptography. Those three terms are key to understanding the thousands of different types of crypto being traded today.\n\n“Decentralized” means that cryptocurrency isn’t issued by a central authority like a government or bank, the way the dollar, euro, yen, and other fiat currencies are. Instead, cryptocurrencies are created, exchanged, and often overseen by a distributed peer-to-peer network.\n\nCrypto is digital, meaning two things. First, with a couple of exceptions, the value of most crypto is not pegged to a fiat currency like the dollar or euro, nor is it determined by a precious metal like gold. And though people may refer to crypto in physical terms (e.g., as coins), crypto is generated and traded in only a digital format.\n\nCryptography refers to the mathematical technique used to secure each unit of cryptocurrency and ensure it can’t be copied.\n\nMost crypto exists on a blockchain platform. Blockchain is the digital ledger that records most crypto transactions. This use of blockchain technology as a foundational element for cryptocurrency began in 2009, in tandem with the launch of Bitcoin. But blockchain technology is evolving rapidly, and a range of other industries are exploring its potential applications as well.\n\nHow Does Cryptocurrency Work?\n\nThere are thousands of cryptocurrencies, and while many are designed to provide some new feature or function on a given blockchain platform, many, if not most are founded on similar principles to those that established Bitcoin. Crypto is secured by a peer-to-peer network, and users can trade or transfer value — globally and almost instantly, 24 hours per day, seven days per week — without relying on a middleman, like a bank or payment processor.\n\nCryptocurrencies are considered secure because they employ a “trustless” system of verification for all transactions. This means that users don’t have to rely on a third party to verify transactions: the system itself is self-governing.\n\nAs of November 2023, estimates of the number of cryptocurrency you can trade are around 8,800, with a total market capitalization of over $1.32 trillion. The biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are Bitcoin and Ethereum – by a wide margin. Cryptocurrencies are generally stored in digital wallets, commonly a blockchain wallet, which allows users to manage and trade different crypto.\n\nWhat Is Blockchain Technology?\n\nThe widespread use of blockchain technology as the underlying platform for most forms of crypto began in 2009, when an innovative use of blockchain enabled the successful launch of Bitcoin. For that reason, many people think of blockchain and cryptocurrency as synonymous, when in fact blockchain technology has a wide variety of applications.\n\nBlockchain is a digital, append-only ledger that can be used to track or record almost any type of asset, from goods and services to patents, smart contracts, and more. It’s transparent, meaning the transactions on a public blockchain are accessible to anyone, and unlike a physical system of record keeping, the record of transactions is designed to be permanent and immutable.\n\nWhy Is It Called Blockchain?\n\nThe reason blockchain records are theoretically unchangeable is because the system is built from “blocks” of data that are “chained” together in chronological order (hence the name “blockchain”) so that all transactions are visible to everyone on the network. Blockchain technology relies on cryptography to secure these transactions and, in the case of many types of crypto, to mine coins and tokens.\n\nWhy Is Blockchain Considered Secure?\n\nA blockchain runs on a decentralized network of computers, called nodes, which enable a form of consensus (peer-to-peer) confirmation that can drive faster, more secure transactions. The distributed, self-governing nature of blockchain thus makes fraud and duplication far more difficult compared with legacy record-keeping systems.\n\nThe combination of speed, security, and transparency has not only enabled the growth of cryptocurrencies worldwide, many other industries are now exploring blockchain’s uses as well.\n\nWhat are Crypto Exchanges?\n\nWith the exception of emerging crypto-based securities, it’s generally not possible to trade crypto on a traditional exchange, which is why you need a crypto exchange.\n\nThere are three main types of crypto exchanges: centralized, decentralized, and hybrid. While centralized exchanges are still more common for trading crypto, it’s important to understand the differences among the three so you can decide which is best for you.\n\nCentralized\n\nA centralized cryptocurrency exchange is a platform where cryptos are bought and sold, with the help of a third party to conduct the transactions. On a centralized exchange you can use a traditional, aka fiat currency, like the dollar to execute trades, as well as trading crypto itself.\n\nDecentralized\n\nDecentralized exchanges (DEX) are more aligned with the spirit of crypto, in that these exchanges allow crypto investors to trade directly with each other, without the need for a middleman. In theory, a DEX might be more secure since there’s no central platform that can be hacked. Also, without the need for third parties, you might see lower fees and faster transaction speeds on a DEX.\n\nHybrid\n\nHybrid exchanges are less common than either centralized or decentralized exchanges. They aim to combine features of both: e.g., the liquidity of a centralized exchange and the security and anonymity of a DEX.\n\nWhen choosing the exchange where you prefer to trade crypto, there are other issues to consider, including ease of use, whether your funds might be insured, as well as other considerations.\n\nBitcoin and Beyond\n\nBitcoin: The OG Crypto\n\nBitcoin (BTC) was the first cryptocurrency to be created in 2009 by a person (or possibly a group) using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was designed to be independent of any government or central bank. Instead it relies on blockchain technology, a decentralized public ledger that contains a digital record of every Bitcoin transaction.\n\nIn essence, Bitcoin established the basic system of cryptography and consensus (i.e., peer-to-peer) verification that is the foundation of most forms of crypto today.\n\nBitcoin History\n\nIn 2008, an individual or group of individuals going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, published a paper called, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” It was not the first case ever made for a digital currency — there were many attempts in the decades prior — but this was perhaps the first to propose a “trustless” system of electronic transactions that would depend on a peer-to-peer system of verification via blockchain technology. This innovative approach also solved a persistent problem with digital currencies, the so-called double-spending problem — or the risk that digital currencies could be hacked and spent more than once.\n\nThanks to the research detailed in this paper, the first Bitcoins were created in January 2009, and the Bitcoin mining system was established. But the number of BTC in the market is capped. While there are more than 18.8 million Bitcoin tokens in circulation as of November 2021, worth over $1 trillion, the total limit is 21 million BTC.\n\nHow Bitcoin Works\n\nBitcoin miners use powerful computers to verify blocks of transactions and generate more Bitcoins — a complex, time-consuming process called proof-of-work (PoW). Each block of transactions is logged permanently on the blockchain, which helps to validate and secure each Bitcoin and the network as a whole. Owing to the vast number of computers or nodes on the Bitcoin blockchain, the PoW process ends up using so much energy that many people question whether it’s sustainable, as noted.\n\nHow To Get Bitcoin\n\nThThere are a few different ways to buy Bitcoin.\n\n• Exchanges. As noted above, you can trade crypto — including Bitcoin — on centralized, decentralized, or hybrid exchanges. All you need is a crypto wallet for storing your Bitcoins.\n\n• ATMs. There are many crypto ATMs scattered around the country where you can purchase Bitcoin. Unlike a traditional ATM, though, you can’t withdraw actual cash from these machines; they make digital only transactions via the blockchain.\n\n• Brokerages. A growing number of brokers now allow you to buy and sell crypto, similar to any other security, including SoFi Invest®.\n\nPros and Cons of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin may be the oldest and most popular form of crypto (by market share), but it has its pros and cons.\n\n• Market capitalization. The crypto-verse comprises thousands of coins and tokens, but Bitcoin is the biggest of them all, with a market cap of more than $675 billion, as of November 2023. For context: Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap, is around $225 billion.\n\n• Volatility. Bitcoin is extremely volatile. Even within the course of a single day, the value can fluctuate by thousands. And on a broader scale, between January and November 2023, Bitcoin’s value was as high as $35,000, and as low as $16,000.\n\n• Not SIPC insured. Most investors are insured by the SIPC up to $500,000 if a brokerage fails (or funds are stolen). But the SIPC doesn’t cover crypto.\n\n• Regulation and usage. The inconsistency of regulations governing crypto has likely limited the use of these currencies around the world. That said, a number of companies do accept Bitcoin as payment — just do your research first.",

Tried loading funds onto it 3 separate times and each time the ACH transfer failed to process on THEIR end but that didn’t stop them from charging me a $30 fee for each time they failed to process the transfer. So right there I lost $90. Customer service is not helpful at all, despite being professional and courteous (as I work in customer service too) each time I tried getting a problem fixed it was always “there’s nothing I can do about that sir” well can you escalate this to a supervisor? “No sir there is nothing we can do” . Funds take a week to transfer between the investing wallet to the actual brokerage account. And another week to transfer it to your actual bank account. They also do not allow for you to take overdraft off. Purchases don’t reflect on the account sometimes until a day later. So you might think you have a little extra money and then spend, turns out you don’t really have that money in your account and BOOM! Overdraft. I am currently in the process of liquidating this account but since they are so slow it will likely take a month or two.

On multiple occasions, I have received conflicting information regarding the same request, which is not only frustrating but entirely unprofessional. In September, I changed the due date of my loan payment, and while it was unclear whether I would be charged twice, I was assured that if that happened, I could request a refund. Predictably, I was indeed charged twice.\n\nSince then, I’ve been forced to contact the bank repeatedly. Initially, I was told the refund would be processed within 6-10 business days. After waiting the full 10 days without any resolution, I called again, only to be told—once more—that I would need to wait another 6-10 days. Unsatisfied with this response, I requested to speak to a manager. At that point, I was informed that my refund request had actually been denied—information that was never communicated to me during any of my previous calls. To make matters worse, I was told that a refund would cause my account to become delinquent, despite the fact that I have now made two payments in a single month.\n\nThis entire situation is completely absurd and reflects the worst customer service I have ever encountered. How can anyone trust a bank that demonstrates such incompetence and lack of transparency? I strongly advise others to think carefully before banking here, as this is a truly appalling way to conduct business.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn’t an isolated issue. Every single time I’ve had to interact with customer service, regardless of the situation, the experience has been similarly frustrating and unhelpful.",

You have to go through more trouble in more circles calling the company just to delete it when you should be able to do that yourself and it should verify the same as it did when you created it.

I was with Chime. I didn’t have any major issues but did run into tiny then multiple concerns invalid options disputes became a regular occurrence sending money and delivery  service payments. Thus causing negative impact or negative account balances. Without Chime to Chime sending money was an issue especially if your expecting transactions delivered immediately. Personal checks would take 5-10 business days if your sender didn’t have Chime. Could not update to Joint Bank Accounts.

EFT the balance payment on my account from the SAME account the loan is paid from. Payment set up on Tuesday, taken Tuesday afternoon from my bank, balance shows ZERO but they essentially FROZE the card and will NOT release the credit limit for 1.5 WEEKS AFTER they have taken the money from my account. Good thing it’s paid off and I now will switch auto payments for Apple and others to a different card. This card is TRASH and will never use it again.

They have a tracker of my loan payment progress on the home page, but when you click into it all it does of show you your transaction history (which isn’t even fully up to date).

Tried loading funds onto it 3 separate times and each time the ACH transfer failed to process on THEIR end but that didn’t stop them from charging me a $30 fee for each time they failed to process the transfer. So right there I lost $90. Customer service is not helpful at all, despite being professional and courteous (as I work in customer service too) each time I tried getting a problem fixed it was always “there’s nothing I can do about that sir” well can you escalate this to a supervisor? “No sir there is nothing we can do” . Funds take a week to transfer between the investing wallet to the actual brokerage account. And another week to transfer it to your actual bank account. They also do not allow for you to take overdraft off. Purchases don’t reflect on the account sometimes until a day later. So you might think you have a little extra money and then spend, turns out you don’t really have that money in your account and BOOM! Overdraft. I am currently in the process of liquidating this account but since they are so slow it will likely take a month or two. I DO NOT recommend anyone to use this app. Chime is a way more responsive platform.",

Within the last couple months I’ve had over 1000 dollars taken from me, to which wasn’t credited back. They told me they didn’t see it as fraud (despite 1000 dollars being taken within a day from the same person w/ different obscure amounts) and the ‘protection’ they keep promising to put on my account has done nothing. They had promised a new debit card to me for months, and I also still have not received it. At this time I’m simply closing down my account, as it’s all gotten too ridiculous. \n\nSoFi starts out well, but their customer service does ultimately nothing in the long run, and seemed to jeopardize my money further rather than help.

There seems to be no way to just use the app without some other product being pitched to you through a pop up or through a menu option that is impossible to remove.  2) There are still a number of settings and features where the app sends you to a web interface to make changes rather than having it built, natively, in the application.  If I had a magic wand and could fix anything, it would be these two things.  Especially #1.

On multiple occasions, I have received conflicting information regarding the same request, which is not only frustrating but entirely unprofessional. In September, I changed the due date of my loan payment, and while it was unclear whether I would be charged twice, I was assured that if that happened, I could request a refund. Predictably, I was indeed charged twice.\n\nSince then, I’ve been forced to contact the bank repeatedly. Initially, I was told the refund would be processed within 6-10 business days. After waiting the full 10 days without any resolution, I called again, only to be told—once more—that I would need to wait another 6-10 days. Unsatisfied with this response, I requested to speak to a manager. At that point, I was informed that my refund request had actually been denied—information that was never communicated to me during any of my previous calls. To make matters worse, I was told that a refund would cause my account to become delinquent, despite the fact that I have now made two payments in a single month.\n\nThis entire situation is completely absurd and reflects the worst customer service I have ever encountered. How can anyone trust a bank that demonstrates such incompetence and lack of transparency? I strongly advise others to think carefully before banking here, as this is a truly appalling way to conduct business.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn’t an isolated issue. Every single time I’ve had to interact with customer service, regardless of the situation, the experience has been similarly frustrating and unhelpful.",

The customer support is poor with reliable pick up times, but best believe you’ll be talking with someone that doesn’t understand there job. With the issue of withdrawing money is impossible and be skeptical of your money for as it takes 5 days to withdraw any money from your SoFi brokerage account, for any of my other brokerages there are no limitations or restrictions to withdraw money at any time. And second of all I waited for my money to pend into my account after 7 days of my money being deposited into SoFi, I wanted to withdraw it back to my bank which it could not let me. So I traded Amazon and sold it right after hoping to be able to withdraw my money since SoFi didn’t receive any money on my brokerage to withdraw for whatever reason. Still won’t work so I call support and she says it’s cause I made a stock trade and now I have to wait 5 days until I can get MINE MONEY, for as I asked her alright than why couldn’t I have withdraw my money before as I tired and she still have no clue or understanding.

Thus causing negative impact or negative account balances. Without Chime to Chime sending money was an issue especially if your expecting transactions delivered immediately. Personal checks would take 5-10 business days if your sender didn’t have Chime. Could not update to Joint Bank Accounts.

They’ll take it out of your loan balance the same day as well. However, with regards to their Creditcard, that is NOT the way it happens. EFT the balance payment on my account from the SAME account the loan is paid from. Payment set up on Tuesday, taken Tuesday afternoon from my bank, balance shows ZERO but they essentially FROZE the card and will NOT release the credit limit for 1.5 WEEKS AFTER they have taken the money from my account. Good thing it’s paid off and I now will switch auto payments for Apple and others to a different card. This card is TRASH and will never use it again.

A part of that is looking for a high yield savings account. I keep seeing Sofi pop up. If you use it, I would be very grateful to hear what you have to say about it. Any pros and cons, are there any fees, minimums, time to transfer, etc.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\n\n## Comment ID khdpanj with +23 score by [(DeathMoJo, Reddit, 2024-01-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/khdpanj/) (in reply to ID 1944r8o):\nI been using SoFi as my primary back just over 2 years now. I also have their credit card and utilize the relay service offered.\n\nIn 2 years I haven't had any major issues with them. \n\nPros:\n- Interest rate is competitive (I utilize a money market for a little more long term money, the cash in savings at SoFi is emergency funds).\n\n- Paycheck via direct deposit always on time (2 days early but sometimes was early as 6 days).\n\n- Customer service was super helpful for placing a long-term alert (traveling overseas for a few months). With that, received a few notifications to ensure it was me making the transaction, which is fine. Card worked in multiple countries with no issues minus the occasional fraud check stated. \n\n- Vaults is a solid idea. I like being able to visualize and setup with each paycheck to move amounts for items. I have it set for travel, insurance and taxes.\n\n- Relay is nice to put all my accounts together in one place to see my net worth.\n\n- I enjoyed the 1 year 3% cash back on the credit card, 2% after the promo. I use the SoFi card as our default fall back for anything that doesnt have a higher reward with another card.\n\nEDIT: - The Overdraft protection to pull from savings to checking is nice for auto payments. I keep all money in the savings to maximize interest.\n\n- Rewards are super easy to redeem and clearly spells out how much you will get and gives you options. I had no issues racking up a years worth (wanted to see how much we actually accumulated) and then requested a credit toward the credit card. Posted in 2 days against the card and reduced that month's auto payment amount.  \n\nCons:\n- the investment section is coming along but still well behind on options and features of bigger investment firms. The 2% IRA bonus is nice right now but compare rates of their funds if you are looking long term. \n\n- No physical branch. Obvious one but if you needed a cashier's check, you would need to wait. I'd suggest a local credit union for cash deposits and any in person needs. \n\n- Credit card payments take a day or two to reflect the balance removed from my SoFi bank account. Kind of annoying but I can live with it. \n\n- Personal checks take 4-5 days for funds to be available. Not a huge deal for me but I know some enjoy the instant availability other banks offer. \n\nOverall, it's been simple and easing using their services. As long as that system continues for me, I'll continue to use SoFi.\n\n### Comment ID l7j93kj with +1 score by [(Shot_Net_2457, Reddit, 2024-06-07)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/l7j93kj/) (in reply to ID khdpanj):\nHey you \nIt’s been a while I hope you see this.

I still use a checking account from a bank with a local in-person branch.\n\nI keep 90% of my funds in the HYSA, and run nearly all my spending through credit cards. Most of my direct deposit goes to SoFi with a small portion to the \"big bank\" checking account. All my bills and credit card payments come straight out of the SoFi HYSA account.\n\nThis has worked out well for nearly a year, I get the benefit of the good APR on most of my money and it works out because SoFi allows unlimited transfers. Pretty much ideal scenario from my POV.\n\n\n\n### Comment ID khebtto with +1 score by [(Resident-Ad-408, Reddit, 2024-01-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/khebtto/) (in reply to ID khdy515):\nWell it would suck if they didn’t do unlimited transfers seeing how they don’t have any branches 😂\n\nI do a similar setup although I’m moving my direct deposit to SoFi to have it all contained in one area for day to day finances. I like their vault system so I don’t have to actively track allocations of savings myself. \n\nI use Amex Gold and a Hilton honors card for my daily expenses and pass my bills through my Amex Platinum so I steadily gain points as I go about life. Definitely a great way to do it with CCs plus they offer the fraud protection your debit card just won’t have.\n\n## Comment ID khe0pqj with +4 score by [(americanadiandrew, Reddit, 2024-01-11)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/khe0pqj/) (in reply to ID 1944r8o):\nIt’s technically my primary bank but it’s only because of the interest rate.

There's nothing \\*wrong\\* with USAA's banking platform - solid bank, but not much in incentives to stay there. Interest rate sucks (like it does with most brick & mortars), no great features, etc.\n\nI checked Ally and then heard about SoFi. Overall, I was more impressed with SoFi's features vs. Ally. The big feature that made me switch was NOT the APY (which I think was 4% at the time) - it was their Vaults feature (Ally has something similar called \"Buckets\".)\n\nBasically, it lets you create sub-accounts inside of your savings account called Vaults. This lets you earmark your cash for a specific goal or purpose. I've wanted a feature like this for close to a decade. \n\nVaults, along with some slight modifications to my financial decisions, suddenly made managing my money significantly easier than it's ever been. \n\nBecause Vaults are inside the Savings account, they also qualify for the higher APY as well.\n\nIf you have overdraft protection, you need to keep money in your actual savings account, because it will not automatically pull money out of any of your Vaults to cover an overdraft. You can transfer money between any of your SoFi Checking, Savings or Vaults instantly, so it's quick and easy to use.\n\nYou also have a feature called Autopilot, which can automatically transfer money from an incoming direct deposit, and auto send to the account or Vault of your choice. Makes it very easy to save money towards goals without having to think about it.\n\nI've been extremely happy with their service and have been with them now for a little over half a year.\n\n## Comment ID khhx8ol with +3 score by [(Kravos76, Reddit, 2024-01-12)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/khhx8ol/) (in reply to ID 1944r8o):\nMy usage of this service was purely to store a profit from a home sale and let it sit for the high yield savings benefit (along with direct deposit of 200/mo) from my employer. \nFast forward to purchasing a new home many months later and needing to wire transfer from SoFi to the title company…\n\nCaution:  if you need to do any wire transfers  - NOT AN ACH - but a real wire transfer; it’s not easy.

They’re similar in almost every way with a few exceptions. Sofi has a higher APY with 4.6% and Capital One is at 4.35%. Sofi has vaults and CO allows you to open up to 20 different savings accounts which is pretty much the same thing. You can invest through Sofi but not CO. Sofi allows you to track other bills and accounts with different banks CO doesn’t. SoFi requires direct deposit to get the higher APY but it’s not a requirement for CO. Things like cashier checks, Venmo and making big purchases like a big down payment for a car are just easier with CO. I’m not sure if these are available with Sofi yet. Both are fee free banking and anything that Sofi falls short on can be covered by Capital One. I suggest using both.

I put over $1000 er month in direct deposit to take advantage of all features including overdraft. You can literally direct deposit ANY amount to get 4.6% but you’ll need $1000 or more for overdraft. How do I use overdraft? I keep ZERO in checking and ANY amount that draws from checking gets pulled from savings. I love the 2% credit card. I love the points from the various activities. I love the vaults. I named a vault truck payment and my paid off truck payment amount automatically dumps in there when my deposit hits and earns the same 4.6%. I have a couple investments in SoFi invest simply to try it out. Transfer times are very quick and my amount limit to transfer is insanely high. Although I don’t know the exact number. ATM fees are zero when you use AllPoint ATM locations which you can find on the app. The only thing I will not do is mobile deposit because I have heard negative things have happened to people. I keep a local credit union to deposit any cash. I always recommend a local fee free bank in addition.

OK, say I put $60K into a savings account. At 4.6% APY, at the end of a calendar year I should have earned $2760 in interest made. If I divide that sum by 12, it amounts to $230 a month. Beginning after the first month after opening my account (my $60K's been in the savings account for 1 month already) would my $60,000 be up to $60,0230.

This is pretty cool, I've never seen it elsewhere, and I really like it.  It's helped me notice some subscriptions etc I needed to get rid of.\n\nCons:\n\n* They don't offer outgoing wire transfers\n* Bill pay service isn't great.  They say they sent a check, but my counterparty claims never to have gotten it.  Resolving this was somewhat time consuming.  Also, they send the checks really slowly, it's like 10 days before the counterparty gets it.\n* They told me it's impossible to get your credit limit on the CC raised.  If you don't like to run heaps of cards, this can lead to high credit utilization % which can hurt your credit score.\n* I got a rep on the online chat who basically couldn't understand what I was trying to tell him.  Either his English wasn't strong enough for the task, or he hadn't been adequately trained.\n* They bug you with lots of notifications and emails advertising add ons\n* No Zelle, which a bunch of tradesmen etc in my city like to use.\n\n## Comment ID kiuu31b with +1 score by [(tylerduzstuff, Reddit, 2024-01-21)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1944r8o/pros_and_cons_of_sofi/kiuu31b/) (in reply to ID 1944r8o):\nMy only bank now - about 2 years. \n\n* Nice having invest, checking, savings, credit card, rewards, all in one account\n* app experience is a lot better than most traditional banks \n* decent interest rates and perks\n* zero fees \n* no time to transfer \n\ncons\n\n1.

Luckily this account is already connected to Sofi. However, the last 4 digits of the account number is different from what it should be. It seems that Sofi uses a ghost number instead of the real account number for “safety reasons”! When contacted the support, they told me the only way I can verify this is the account I need is to do test transfer with some small amount of money.\n\nIt seems pretty stupid to me to not showing numbers of the linked accounts. All the other banks I’m using all correctly show the account number. \n\nAny suggestions on checking the linked account status?\n\n## Comment ID kzw9rtj with +7 score by [(MzDrea26, Reddit, 2024-04-16)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1c5rhkr/sofi_changed_the_account_number_of_connected/kzw9rtj/) (in reply to ID 1c5rhkr):\nDepends on the bank, for security reasons some banks don’t display/share your actual account number when linked externally, it’s a protection feature, for sure I know Chase has a history of doing this\n\n### Comment ID l05i3vf with +1 score by [(zo3foxx, Reddit, 2024-04-18)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/1c5rhkr/sofi_changed_the_account_number_of_connected/l05i3vf/) (in reply to ID kzw9rtj):\nYep was about to say Chase does this.

To perform a manual account update, use these steps:\r  \n\r  \n1. Starting on the \"Home\" page of Full View®, identify the manual account and click on it\r  \n2. On the \"Account\" page, click the \"Edit\" button\r  \n3.

I've also had zero issues with their customer service - the few times I've actually needed to use it. They've always been professional, friendly and helpful. \n\nOne feature I always wanted (that I didn't know anyone offered until I started checking other banks out) is a \"sub account\" in the savings account - similar to SoFi's Vaults or Ally's Buckets. USAA doesn't offer it, and it seems like such a no-brainer of a feature to have - set aside money for different goals in the same account - see the total, but also see that your money is split up for different things - massive win for me.\n\nI've come to realize that as much as I like USAA for all their services, they're just falling behind. I would have never considered switching away from them for car insurance - been with them 23 years on my own policy, and before that with my parents. \n\nBut I see SoFi offers car insurance too, so hey, may as well get a quote, if nothing else. See if they really can beat a company I've had almost a 25 year history with.\n\nI'm keeping my USAA credit card - don't want to lose over a decade of history. Doesn't have great cash back, but it IS good for when I travel internationally. No FTF, good travel benefits like accident insurance, trip cancellation and a couple of other perks.\n\nBack to SoFi - I've been reading a lot of reviews, watching a lot of Youtube reviews...the only thing I think I \\*don't\\* know at this point - do they actually offer checks with the checking account? None of the Youtube reviews have mentioned it one way or another.

Will this make it impossible to transfer money between the two? For anyone who's on SoFi right now, are there any ways I could get around this (ie. is there a non-Plaid option to withdraw my money from SoFi)?\n\n\n\n## Comment ID iwaef3k with +4 score by [(VAer1, Reddit, 2022-11-14)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/yubr0b/transferring_money_between_sofi_another_external/iwaef3k/) (in reply to ID yubr0b):\nOf course you can transfer money between the two(SoFi checking and external bank account), all you have to do is: manually add the external account with routing number and account number, then verify two trial deposit.\n\nFor ACH transfer, I never set up with Plaid, I always set up with routing number/account number. My understand is: for plain set up (account username and password), if you have anything change (password change) or some website change, ACH transfer may not work, you may need to set up plain again. While routing number and account number setup is reliable for long term.\n\nBut you can use Plain to link external account to Relay Insight, it is for viewing external account balance/activities, not for ACH transfer. This has nothing to do with ACH transfer.\n\nFor ACH transfer, you will need to add it as external account, either by routing number/account number or by plain. I much prefer using routing number/account number.\n\n## Comment ID iw8muwk with +2 score by [(mistafoot, Reddit, 2022-11-13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/yubr0b/transferring_money_between_sofi_another_external/iw8muwk/) (in reply to ID yubr0b):\nSofi uses plaid to link accounts, but I couldn’t ever get it to work so had to link my external account using invest.

Plaid is preferred, I think they allow greater same day funds availability. But you can add up to 2-3 accounts manually (I forget if it’s 2 or 3 manual links) (manual being account /RTN). To link an account manually, allow the plaid box to open and type “manually” - select cancel when your bank doesn’t come up. Follow the prompts to link an account manually. For me, sofi didn’t allow manual linking when the account was brand new.\n\nNote: please review the plaid privacy policy. They suck up ALL data from linked bank accounts. You can manage your data with the (relatively new) plaid portal.\n\n### Comment ID j7ojrg4 with +1 score by [(None, Reddit, 2023-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/yubr0b/transferring_money_between_sofi_another_external/j7ojrg4/) (in reply to ID iwc9b7j):\n[deleted]\n\n#### Comment ID j7rexxp with +1 score by [(JV701, Reddit, 2023-02-08)](https://www.reddit.com/r/sofi/comments/yubr0b/transferring_money_between_sofi_another_external/j7rexxp/) (in reply to ID j7ojrg4):\nI think maybe I had to have a direct deposit coming in - which I started right away upon opening the account.

Funds take a week to transfer between the investing wallet to the actual brokerage account. And another week to transfer it to your actual bank account. They also do not allow for you to take overdraft off. Purchases don’t reflect on the account sometimes until a day later. So you might think you have a little extra money and then spend, turns out you don’t really have that money in your account and BOOM! Overdraft.

Problem is the companies are credit cards, utilities, ect. I like the platform and had high hope, but this is a banking app for those in desperate time and can’t get a real bank.

Within the last couple months I’ve had over 1000 dollars taken from me, to which wasn’t credited back. They told me they didn’t see it as fraud (despite 1000 dollars being taken within a day from the same person w/ different obscure amounts) and the ‘protection’ they keep promising to put on my account has done nothing. They had promised a new debit card to me for months, and I also still have not received it. At this time I’m simply closing down my account, as it’s all gotten too ridiculous. \n\nSoFi starts out well, but their customer service does ultimately nothing in the long run, and seemed to jeopardize my money further rather than help.

          "content": "I don’t typically leave reviews, but my experience with this bank has been so poor that I feel obligated to share it in order to warn others about what banking here is truly like.\n\nThe level of customer service is absolutely unacceptable. On multiple occasions, I have received conflicting information regarding the same request, which is not only frustrating but entirely unprofessional. In September, I changed the due date of my loan payment, and while it was unclear whether I would be charged twice, I was assured that if that happened, I could request a refund. Predictably, I was indeed charged twice.\n\nSince then, I’ve been forced to contact the bank repeatedly. Initially, I was told the refund would be processed within 6-10 business days. After waiting the full 10 days without any resolution, I called again, only to be told—once more—that I would need to wait another 6-10 days. Unsatisfied with this response, I requested to speak to a manager. At that point, I was informed that my refund request had actually been denied—information that was never communicated to me during any of my previous calls. To make matters worse, I was told that a refund would cause my account to become delinquent, despite the fact that I have now made two payments in a single month.\n\nThis entire situation is completely absurd and reflects the worst customer service I have ever encountered. How can anyone trust a bank that demonstrates such incompetence and lack of transparency? I strongly advise others to think carefully before banking here, as this is a truly appalling way to conduct business.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn’t an isolated issue. Every single time I’ve had to interact with customer service, regardless of the situation, the experience has been similarly frustrating and unhelpful.",

And second of all I waited for my money to pend into my account after 7 days of my money being deposited into SoFi, I wanted to withdraw it back to my bank which it could not let me. So I traded Amazon and sold it right after hoping to be able to withdraw my money since SoFi didn’t receive any money on my brokerage to withdraw for whatever reason. Still won’t work so I call support and she says it’s cause I made a stock trade and now I have to wait 5 days until I can get MINE MONEY, for as I asked her alright than why couldn’t I have withdraw my money before as I tired and she still have no clue or understanding.

On top of that if you filled it out for a reason like investing and you want to move on due to trouble it’s so lame it won’t let you delete your profile yourself. You have to go through more trouble in more circles calling the company just to delete it when you should be able to do that yourself and it should verify the same as it did when you created it. Since when do we need permission to delete our account including if we changed our mind and it’s empty cause it wouldn’t give us what we were looking for?

Love that it give you spending breakdowns in Relay and you get a lot of features including investing. It feels very robust and can feel overwhelming at first but once you understand everything it give you a lot of information. The one thing I am begging y’all to is make a quick view widget.

Offering those benefits upfront would be a better way to win over customers, but it seems SoFi has other priorities.\n\nRight now, it seems to be working.

Insurance travel and offers various benefit loan and credit builder services.\n Sofi is a One stop shop. Took a risk opening an account with a online bank without a lot of advertising. I was with Chime. I didn’t have any major issues but did run into tiny then multiple concerns invalid options disputes became a regular occurrence sending money and delivery  service payments. Thus causing negative impact or negative account balances. Without Chime to Chime sending money was an issue especially if your expecting transactions delivered immediately. Personal checks would take 5-10 business days if your sender didn’t have Chime. Could not update to Joint Bank Accounts. Sofi offers 10x more than Chime plus they actually assist you in any transaction, department or offer discounts upon lack of processing options. This Bank will be #1 Online Banking Services within next year! Guarantee!!!\nSuper Happy 😀💵💰",

The ATM locator is factually incorrect for almost every location.\n\nSofi bank wrongfully accused me of fraud for two Zelle transactions of $550.

After it went through, on my pay day, I called to get it disputed and they said it would take 10 business days for me to get my money back and to add insult to injury they want me to provide information to screenshots as proof of the scam in order for it to help my case. Never in my life had I heard of a bank that does business this way with its customers! I banked with Chase before this and anytime I was unfortunately scammed, all I had to do was call and dispute it and was able to get the money back the same day!! I guess it’s time to switch back to Chase now, I don’t even know why I bothered to switch to this bank.

However, with regards to their Creditcard, that is NOT the way it happens. EFT the balance payment on my account from the SAME account the loan is paid from. Payment set up on Tuesday, taken Tuesday afternoon from my bank, balance shows ZERO but they essentially FROZE the card and will NOT release the credit limit for 1.5 WEEKS AFTER they have taken the money from my account. Good thing it’s paid off and I now will switch auto payments for Apple and others to a different card. This card is TRASH and will never use it again. Not only that but after the interest hit my card, it went over the limit and writhing 15min I had alerts from EVERY credit report because SoFi quickly posted to them saying it was over the limit.

The “improvements” that were always “just around the corner” either never came or were too little and too late. Get the fraud managers out of the SOP process completely and hire an independent, experienced fraud investigator and/or education specialist to make the SOPs. The crap they had us using in a google doc was an absolute joke.",

Completely unrealistic production standards that can only be met by sacrificing quality which costs millions of dollars and allows for ID theft. I regularly had to make calls that I knew were bad because we weren’t allowed time to properly do research. The company wouldn’t even pay for a backup IP search tool and we were stuck using whatever we could find on the internet. In the last year, SoFi seemed to be moving backwards in terms of progress and job quality. Not forwards. RTO, removal of development opportunities, lower raises, downsizing, etc all makes the company seem less like a FinTech and more like it was trying to be a bank. Which it didn’t know how to do yet.",

We are also committed to ensuring promotions are conducted in a fair and equitable way. We have a semi-annual performance check-in program to award merit increases and promotions. The program is rooted in our leveling guide, which each employee is evaluated against. We aim to create a consistently positive member experience with every interaction, and in order to do so, we set very specific metrics - all employees are provided and evaluated against. Every employee is held to the same set of metrics, and we strive to give everyone the training and tools they need to meet and exceed expectations. If you have any concerns about the process, we highly recommend you reach out to your People Business Partner (PBP) or your manager - who are here to support your career journey. You can also email us at glassdoor@sofi.org. Thanks for being on this journey with us! Take care.",

I regularly had to make calls that I knew were bad because we weren’t allowed time to properly do research. The company wouldn’t even pay for a backup IP search tool and we were stuck using whatever we could find on the internet. In the last year, SoFi seemed to be moving backwards in terms of progress and job quality. Not forwards.

      "# [An Update on SoFi’s Crypto Services on 2023-11-29](https://www.sofi.com/blog/sofi-crypto-update/)\nAt SoFi, our mission has always been clear: to help you get your money right. Everything we offer—from investment accounts to member benefits—echoes this mission. However, sometimes this means making changes to our business.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we’ve made the decision to discontinue our crypto services by the end of this year. To ensure our members can continue investing however they want, we are giving members the option to migrate their crypto holdings to Blockchain.com, one of the leading cryptocurrency platforms, to ease the transition. Crypto members’ can choose to either migrate their accounts and assets to Blockchain.com, or to liquidate their holdings with all transaction fees from selling crypto reimbursed.\n\nWhat Does this Mean for Members?\n\nSoFi will no longer be opening new crypto trading accounts, but all existing members with active crypto accounts can buy and sell crypto as usual. To ensure each member can choose the option that works best for them, they can choose either of the following:\n\nBlockchain Migration\n\nIn order to make this transition seamless, SoFi will handle migrating members’ crypto holdings to Blockchain.com. SoFi members only need to opt in via the SoFi web or app and the rest is handled. If members do not agree to the migration, all crypto holdings will be liquidated and funds will be deposited into their brokerage accounts after the migration is completed.\n\nSoFi and Blockchain.com will send new account information to all members so they can log in and start trading shortly after the migration is completed. Members will no longer be able to trade any cryptocurrency with SoFi as of Friday, 12/19.\n\nDue to local availability with Blockchain.com, members in Hawaii, Louisiana, New Jersey, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia may need to sell certain coins prior to migration (more details in the FAQ section here).\n\nClose SoFi Crypto Accounts\n\nFor members that prefer not to migrate their holdings to a Blockchain.com account, they can liquidate their holdings by end of day 12/18 (11:59 PM ET / 8:59 PM PT).\n\nSoFi will reimburse all fees on crypto sales through 12/19 to ensure the migration is as frictionless as possible.\n\nNew York State Residents\n\nFor members residing in New York State, SoFi will not migrate accounts to Blockchain.com due to local availability. Members can sell their crypto assets and close their accounts by end of day 1/27 (11:59 PM ET / 8:59 PM PT).\n\nIf members do not sell before 1/27, SoFi will liquidate and close the crypto accounts on 1/28, and deposit any proceeds from the sales into the members’ brokerage accounts shortly after the migration is completed. All transaction fees from selling crypto will be reimbursed by 1/30.\n\nIt’s important to us to ensure members can select the path forward that best suits their needs. In addition to reimbursing all transaction fees from selling crypto, SoFi’s investment specialists will be available to help members navigate this process from start to finish as needed.\n\nWhy Blockchain.com?\n\nThe decision to work with Blockchain.com on this migration for members was due to their long-standing work in the cryptocurrency industry, and particularly their dedication to an intuitive user experience and abundant educational resources.\n\nAdditionally, Blockchain.com offers a variety of services beyond buying, selling and holding crypto, including:\n\n1. All in One Place: Buy, sell, swap, and self-custody your crypto in one app for a simple, seamless experience.\n\n2. DeFi Wallet Access: Members will be able to explore the option to self-custody their crypto using Blockchain.com’s DeFi Wallet, giving members greater control over their assets and seamless access to the decentralized finance space.\n\n3. Advanced Trading Features: Members will enjoy a new, expanded range of advanced trading features and tools. Blockchain.com provides a comprehensive platform for both beginners and experienced traders alike.\n\n4. Educational Resources: Blockchain.com is committed to empowering investors beyond the platform by providing access to a wealth of educational resources to stay informed and make confident decisions in the crypto space.\n\nWhat does this mean for SoFi Invest?\n\nThe decision to make changes to SoFi’s cryptocurrency model does not impact other SoFi Invest offerings (e.g., brokerage accounts, IRAs, etc).\n\nSoFi will continue to invest in expanding our products and services, as well as improve upon our current offerings. In recent months, SoFi launched the biggest upgrade to SoFi Invest’s design since launching in 2019, as well as launching a 1% match to IRAs and offered access to some of the most anticipated Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) of the year via the SoFi IPO investing platform.\n\nSoFi is constantly looking at ways to offer members the best experience and empower them to achieve financial independence. SoFi will have more exciting news to share in the coming months as well.\n\nLooking forward\n\nPutting members interests first has always been SoFi’s top priority, and we’re here to make the migration as seamless as possible while continuing to offer members access to all investment opportunities to ensure they can reach their financial goals\n\nWe truly appreciate members’ understanding as we navigate this migration and remain committed to our mission of doing everything we can to help members get their money right.\n\nDisclosure\n\n1.

      "# [SoFi Technologies, Inc. (SOFI) Latest Stock News & Headlines](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOFI/news/)\nSoFi Stock Didn’t Get Enough of a ‘Trump Bump.’ How Other Payment Companies Fared.\n\nOf course, the market did a tap dance Wednesday following news that Trump had won the presidency, and payment stocks certainly were celebrating. To better understand why, Mizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev sorted them into a trio of move categories: those whose moves were deserved, stocks that didn’t rise enough, and shares that have gone too far. Robinhood gained 20% to $29.86 on Wednesday, and though the recent flurry of trading activity likely isn’t sustainable, Mizuho believes the crypto company’s mix of financial services should benefit from an uptick in user engagement.\n\nSoFi Technologies, Inc.

SoFi’s Referral Program\n\nLast Updated: September 20, 2024\n\nThe following describes the terms of service which apply to participation in the referral or account opening promotional programs (collectively, the “Referral Programs”) currently offered by Social Finance, LLC (“SoFi”) and its affiliates. If you wish to participate in any Referral Program described below, you agree to the terms for such Referral Program described in Part I below, as well as the General Terms and Conditions in Part II, which apply to all Referral Programs.\n\nPlease note that any friend whom you’d like to refer must use your specific product referral link in accordance with the terms and conditions associated with the specific promotional campaign for that link. By clicking “Share Link” and sharing your link with your friend, you agree that you have express consent to send your friend promotional messages about SoFi’s products and services. Note you have separate referral links for (1) Personal Loans and Student Loans, (2) Checking and Savings accounts, or (3) Invest products. Only one referral reward and one welcome bonus per new customer, with the exception of referrals for new closed end unsecured installment loans. You will not receive multiple referral bonuses for the same friend taking advantage of multiple promotions, nor will your friend receive multiple welcome bonuses for taking advantage of multiple promotions unless they are for a new closed end unsecured installment loan that your friend has not previously obtained. You will receive an additional referral bonus for the same friend funding a new personal loan, new student loan refinance or new private student loan, provided the friend applies through the specific product’s referral link and has not previously obtained that type of closed end unsecured lending product. Employees of Social Finance, LLC and its affiliates are not eligible to receive referral bonuses under the Referral Programs.\n\nEach person referred should be someone you have a direct, personal relationship with. You may not distribute a Referral Link or otherwise solicit anyone through mass email, any form of commercial advertising or other similar means.\n\nSoFi reserves the right to review, investigate, and disqualify anyone from participation in the SoFi Referral Program at any time, and reserves the right to not honor any referral which in our sole discretion was solicited in a manner inconsistent with the spirit or terms and conditions of the SoFi Referral Program.\n\nFurthermore, SoFi Securities reserves the right to seek reimbursement from any customer (including by deduction from their Invest Account) of amounts paid as Referral Bonuses to customers solicited via mass solicitation. Please note that in certain circumstances the deduction of such amounts from their account may result in a negative balance.\n\nAny person referred to a SoFi loan or SoFi Checking or Savings account may not have an existing registered SoFi account. A person referred to a SoFi Invest account may have an existing SoFi account.\n\nIf account funding is required to meet referral bonus payout eligibility, P2P transfers or proceeds of a reward, promotion or similar program are not eligible methods of funding.\n\nTo protect the privacy of those you refer, referral prospect account information or eligibility is not, under any circumstances, permitted to be shared with referral promoters.\n\nReferral Program — Part I\n\nLoan Referral Program\n\nThe terms below and those set forth in Part II govern your participation in SoFi Bank, N.A.’s (“SoFi Bank”) Loan Referral Program (the “Loan Referral Program“) described below. The Loan Referral Program is open to any consumer who registers on SoFi’s website and who resides outside of the state of Vermont (the “Eligible Loan Referrer(s)“). Employees of Social Finance, LLC and its affiliates are not eligible to receive Loan Referral Bonuses under the Loan Referral Program.\n\nEligible Loan Referrers are limited to refer friends, colleagues, family members, and other people they (collectively, the “Eligible Loan Recipient(s)“) believe may be interested in applying for a student loan or personal loan product as described in a specific promotional campaign (collectively, the “Eligible Loan(s)“). SoFi Bank reserves the right to disqualify anyone from participating in the Loan Referral Program at any time. The Eligible Loan Referrers will NOT receive a Loan Referral Bonus for referrals for any other SoFi Bank loan products. Anyone who violates these terms and conditions is ineligible for payment of any bonus.\n\nTo receive credit for a referral under the Loan Referral Program, Eligible Loan Referrers must send their unique referral link to an Eligible Loan Recipient, the Eligible Loan Recipient must use their Eligible Loan Referrer’s unique referral link within 120 days after receipt of the Eligible Loan Referrer’s unique referral link, and the Eligible Loan Recipient must meet the terms and conditions of the specific promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral. Further, in order for the Eligible Loan Recipient to receive their Loan Welcome bonus for a SoFi Personal Loan, the loan must still be an active loan in good standing ninety (90) days after the disbursement date. For Private Student Loan referrals, the Eligible Loan Recipient and Eligible Loan Referrer will receive their bonus sixty (60) days after their first loan disbursement, and the Eligible Loan Referrer is eligible for a maximum of 5 total referral bonuses for the Private Student Loan product. Further, for referrals for the Private Student Loan product no payments will be made if the Eligible Loan Referrer is employed by a qualified educational institution. If the Eligible Loan Recipient uses the Eligible Loan Referrer’s unique referral link and meets the terms and conditions of the specific promotional campaign associated with that unique referral link, SoFi Bank or its designee shall pay to (a) the Eligible Loan Referrer, a referral bonus into a SoFi Bank Checking or Savings account in the amount specified in the promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral (the “Loan Referral Bonus“); and (b) the Eligible Loan Recipient, a welcome bonus into a SoFi Bank Checking or Savings account in the amount specified in the promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral (the “Loan Welcome Bonus“). Only one Loan Referral Bonus and one Loan Welcome Bonus will be awarded for each referred Eligible Loan Recipient, regardless of whether the Eligible Loan Recipient takes out multiple Eligible Loans. Further, and notwithstanding the above, the following additional restrictions shall apply (1) no Loan Referral Bonus will be paid to otherwise Eligible Loan Referrers who are residents of Vermont, and (2) no Loan Referral Bonus will be paid for otherwise funded loans made to Vermont residents. An Eligible Loan Referrer will not earn a Loan Referral Bonus if the Eligible Loan Recipient has or had an existing funded SoFi loan account, or if the Eligible Loan Recipient does not use the unique referral link provided by the Eligible Loan Referrer.\n\nIf the Eligible Loan Recipient already has a SoFi loan account, is on our opt-out list or the national email opt-out list, or has already used another Eligible Loan Referrer’s unique referral link, the Eligible Loan Recipient may not be sent an email. We cannot disclose to you any information about funded loans opened by any Eligible Loan Recipients you refer to us. Participation in the Loan Referral Program serves as a one-time limited waiver of privacy rights by both parties, whereby each may become aware of the presence of an account relationship with SoFi Bank.\n\n$1,000 Medical and Dental Referral Offer: All referral program terms and conditions apply. Offer is subject to lender approval and not available to residents of Vermont. The offer is only open to new medical or dental Student Loan Refinance borrowers and may not be combined with other offers aside from the autopay discount.

Once conditions are met and the loan has been disbursed, both the referrer and referee welcome bonus will be deposited into their respective SoFi Checking and Savings or Money account within 30 calendar days. Bonuses that are not redeemed within 180 calendar days of the date they were made available to the recipient may be subject to forfeit. Bonus amounts of $600 or greater in a single calendar year will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as miscellaneous income to the recipient on Form 1099-MISC in the year received as required by applicable law. Recipient is responsible for any applicable federal, state or local taxes associated with receiving the bonus offer; consult your tax advisor to determine applicable tax consequences. SoFi reserves the right to change or terminate the offer at any time with or without notice.\n\nInvest Referral Program\n\nThe terms below and those set forth in Part II govern your participation in the SoFi Invest Referral Program (the “Invest Referral Program”). The Invest Referral Program is open to all current SoFi Active Invest account holders who meet the criteria below, and wish to refer someone to open a SoFi Invest account offered by SoFi Securities LLC. A referrer must have a SoFi Invest account offered by SoFi Securities LLC (either an Automated Invest account or an Active Invest account) which is funded and in good standing (i.e., not suspended) (an “Eligible Invest Referrer(s)”). Employees of Social Finance, LLC and its affiliates are not eligible to receive Invest Referral Bonuses under the Invest Referral Program.\n\nThe Eligible Invest Referrers are encouraged to refer friends, colleagues, family members, and anyone else they believe may be interested in opening a SoFi Active Invest account (the “Eligible Invest Recipient(s)”). The Eligible Invest Referrers will NOT receive an Invest Referral Bonus for referrals for a SoFi Automated Invest account. SoFi Securities LLC, or its designee (collectively, “SoFi Securities”) reserve the right to disqualify anyone from participation in the Invest Referral Program at any time.\n\nTo receive credit for a referral made under the Invest Referral Program, an Eligible Invest Referrer must access their own unique referral link and send it to the Eligible Invest Recipient(s) whom they wish to refer to open a new SoFi Active Invest Account (an “New Active Invest Account”). The Eligible Invest Recipient must use the Eligible Invest Referrer’s unique referral link to open a New Active Invest Account within 120 days after receipt of the Eligible Invest Referrer’s unique referral link, and meet the terms and conditions of the specific promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral.\n\nFor each Eligible Invest Recipient who opens and funds a New Active Invest Account within 120 days after receipt of the Eligible Invest Referrer’s unique referral link, and meets the terms and conditions of the specific promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral, SoFi Securities will: (a) credit an Invest account of the Eligible Invest Referrer with a referral bonus in the amount and method specified in the promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral (the “Invest Referral Bonus”); and (b) credit the New Active Invest Account of the Eligible Invest Recipient, with a one-time welcome bonus in the amount and method specified in the promotional campaign associated with the unique referral link that was used for the referral (the “Invest Welcome Bonus”). Only one Invest Referral Bonus and one Invest Welcome Bonus will be awarded for each referred Eligible Invest Recipient, regardless of whether the Eligible Invest Recipient opens and funds multiple accounts. An Eligible Invest Referrer will not earn an Invest Referral Bonus if the Eligible Invest Recipient has or had an existing funded SoFi Invest account or does not use the unique referral link provided by the Eligible Invest Referrer.\n\nPlease note that if the Eligible Invest Recipient already has an Invest account, is on our opt-out list or on the national email opt-out list, or has already used another Eligible Invest Referrer’s unique referral link, SoFi Securities will not send an email to such Eligible Invest Recipient. We cannot disclose to you any information about New Active Invest Accounts opened by any Eligible Invest Recipients you refer to us. Participation in the Invest Referral Program serves as a one-time, limited waiver of privacy rights by both you and the Eligible Invest Recipient, pursuant to which each may become aware that the other has an account relationship with SoFi Securities.\n\nBank Referral Program\n\nReferred participants must first apply and successfully open a SoFi Checking and Savings account. To receive the promotional bonus, they must then make a deposit of $50 or more that settles within 14 days of registration. The deposit must be made via an ACH transfer from a linked bank account, via “Instant Transfer” from a debit card (if available), or from cash deposits, mobile check deposits, or wires. P2P transfers (ACH-based P2P or debit-card based P2P from Venmo, PayPal, Apple Cash, Square Cash, etc.) are excluded. Within 7 business days of such a qualifying deposit, SoFi will: (a) credit referred members a one-time cash bonus of $25 into their SoFi Checking and Savings account and (b) credit the referrer a one-time cash bonus of $75 into their SoFi Checking and Savings account. The referrer must have an open SoFi Checking and Savings account within 60 days of a successful referral in order to receive their one-time cash bonus of $75. Note that this is a limited-time offer from SoFi with limited availability, and is subject to expire at any time. Referrer will not earn a referral bonus if the recipient has or had an existing SoFi account or profile, or does not use the unique referral link provided by the referrer. Employees of Social Finance, LLC and its affiliates are not eligible to receive referral bonuses under the Bank Referral Program. In no event will any referrer or recipient be entitled to receive more than $10,000 in cumulative referral or welcome bonuses under all available SoFi referral programs within any calendar year. Bonuses are considered miscellaneous income, and will be reportable to the IRS on Form 1099-MISC (or Form 1042-S, if applicable). This SoFi Checking and Savings Referral Offer cannot be combined with the SoFi Checking and Savings “account $20 open offer.” SoFi reserves the right to disqualify anyone from participation in the referral program at any time. SoFi reserves the right to change or terminate the offer at any time without notice.\n\nGeneral Terms and Conditions — Part II\n\nReferral Cap\n\nIn no event will any person be entitled to receive more than $10,000 in cumulative referrals or welcome bonuses under these Referral Programs within any calendar year. In addition, SoFi reserves the right to, at any time, limit the maximum number of times a Referral Link can be used. Referral Bonuses and Welcome Bonuses are each considered miscellaneous income and may be reportable to the IRS on Form 1099-MISC (or Form 1042-S, if applicable).\n\nNon-Solicitation Agreement\n\nIf you participate in any of the Invest Referral Program, Money Referral Program, or the Loan Referral Program described above (collectively, the “Referral Program(s)”), you agree not to participate in any other solicitations for SoFi products. Other than as set forth herein, you agree not to compensate or accept any compensation from applicants whom you refer to SoFi through any of the corresponding Referral Programs described above. You further agree that your activities will be limited to referring potential customers as described above, so they may independently decide whether to apply. You may not collect information from eligible recipients under any Referral Program, assist with filling out an application, or discuss specific product terms.\n\nNo Spam\n\nYou must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, in soliciting referrals. Eligible referrers may not purchase internet search terms or publicly advertise SoFi’s products or name in any fashion. Further, any distribution of a program link that could constitute unsolicited commercial email or “spam,” any content which impersonates or implies an affiliation with or endorsement by SoFi or any SoFi subsidiary, or any actions which otherwise violate any terms or conditions imposed by SoFi, or that SoFi determines in its sole discretion to be fraudulent in nature, are prohibited and will be grounds for immediate termination from a Referral Program. We will not honor referral payments for referrals which are generated using any of the foregoing means.\n\nIndependent Contractor\n\nYour participation in a Referral Program is solely as an independent contractor. Neither you nor SoFi intend to establish an employment relationship, and you are not entitled to any benefits. We may require completion of a Form W-9 prior to payment of any referral or welcome bonus. Any payments that are not claimed within 180 days of the date the funds have been made available because either the direct deposit bank account or required tax information have not been provided are subject to forfeit.\n\nConflict\n\nIn the event any of the terms of these Terms of Service conflicts with any terms in a specific promotional campaign associated with a unique referral link, the terms of these Terms of Service shall govern.\n\nDiscontinuation of Previous Referral Program\n\nThe Referral Programs described herein replace all earlier versions of such SoFi referral programs. SoFi reserves the right to temporarily, or permanently modify or discontinue the Referral Programs at any time, for any reason, at our sole discretion and without notice to you.\n\n9.

SoFi Plus\n\nLast Updated: October 30, 2024\n\nSoFi Plus is a benefits program (“Benefits Program”) offered by Social Finance, LLC and its affiliates (collectively “SoFi”) that gives SoFi Plus members (“defined below”) the opportunity to take advantage of various benefits across the SoFi ecosystem.\n\n(a) Eligibility:\n\n(i) SoFi Plus members are defined as customers of SoFi Checking and Savings, which is offered by SoFi Bank, National Association, Member FDIC, who have Direct Deposit (defined below) into a SoFi Checking and Savings account. Direct Deposit means a recurring deposit of regular income to an account holder’s SoFi Checking or Savings account, including payroll, pension, or government benefit payments (e.g., Social Security), made by the account holder’s employer, payroll or benefits provider or government agency (“Direct Deposit”) via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Network. Deposits that are not from an employer or government agency, including but not limited to check deposits, peer-to-peer transfers (e.g., transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc.), merchant transactions (e.g., transactions from PayPal, Stripe, Square, etc.), and bank ACH funds transfers and wire transfers from external accounts, or are non-recurring in nature (e.g. IRS tax refunds), do not constitute Direct Deposit activity. SoFi Bank shall, in its sole discretion, assess each account holder’s Direct Deposit activity to determine eligibility and may require additional documentation to complete this verification. SoFi Plus member benefits will be lost during periods in which the customer has turned off Direct Deposit into their account. PLEASE NOTE: If you qualify for the higher annual percentage yield (“APY”) via Qualifying Deposits (as defined below), rather than Direct Deposit activity, you will NOT qualify for the other SoFi Plus benefits. Currently, the only way to qualify for all SoFi Plus benefits is with Direct Deposit.\n\n(b) SoFi Plus member Benefits:\n\n(i) 4.20% APY on savings:\n\nSoFi members with direct deposit activity can earn 4.20% annual percentage yield (APY) on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances. Direct Deposit means a recurring deposit of regular income to an account holder’s SoFi Checking or Savings account, including payroll, pension, or government benefit payments (e.g., Social Security), made by the account holder’s employer, payroll or benefits provider or government agency (“Direct Deposit”) via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Network during a 30-day Evaluation Period (as defined below). Deposits that are not from an employer or government agency, including but not limited to check deposits, peer-to-peer transfers (e.g., transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc.), merchant transactions (e.g., transactions from PayPal, Stripe, Square, etc.), and bank ACH funds transfers and wire transfers from external accounts, or are non-recurring in nature (e.g., IRS tax refunds), do not constitute Direct Deposit activity. There is no minimum Direct Deposit amount required to qualify for the stated interest rate. SoFi members with direct deposit are eligible for other SoFi Plus benefits.\n\nAs an alternative to direct deposit, SoFi members with Qualifying Deposits can earn 4.20% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances. Qualifying Deposits means one or more deposits that, in the aggregate, are equal to or greater than $5,000 to an account holder’s SoFi Checking and Savings account (“Qualifying Deposits”) during a 30-day Evaluation Period (as defined below). Qualifying Deposits only include those deposits from the following eligible sources: (i) ACH transfers, (ii) inbound wire transfers, (iii) peer-to-peer transfers (i.e., external transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc. and internal peer-to-peer transfers from a SoFi account belonging to another account holder), (iv) check deposits, (v) instant funding to your SoFi Bank Debit Card, (vi) push payments to your SoFi Bank Debit Card, and (vii) cash deposits. Qualifying Deposits do not include: (i) transfers between an account holder’s Checking account, Savings account, and/or Vaults; (ii) interest payments; (iii) bonuses issued by SoFi Bank or its affiliates; or (iv) credits, reversals, and refunds from SoFi Bank, N.A. (“SoFi Bank”) or from a merchant. SoFi members with Qualifying Deposits are not eligible for other SoFi Plus benefits.\n\nSoFi Bank shall, in its sole discretion, assess each account holder’s Direct Deposit activity and Qualifying Deposits throughout each 30-Day Evaluation Period to determine the applicability of rates and may request additional documentation for verification of eligibility. The 30-Day Evaluation Period refers to the “Start Date” and “End Date” set forth on the APY Details page of your account, which comprises a period of 30 calendar days (the “30-Day Evaluation Period”). You can access the APY Details page at any time by logging into your SoFi account on the SoFi mobile app or SoFi website and selecting either (i) Banking > Savings > Current APY or (ii) Banking > Checking > Current APY. Upon receiving a Direct Deposit or $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits to your account, you will begin earning 4.20% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% on checking balances on or before the following calendar day. You will continue to earn these APYs for (i) the remainder of the current 30-Day Evaluation Period and through the end of the subsequent 30-Day Evaluation Period and (ii) any following 30-day Evaluation Periods during which SoFi Bank determines you to have Direct Deposit activity or $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits without interruption.\n\nSoFi Bank reserves the right to grant a grace period to account holders following a change in Direct Deposit activity or Qualifying Deposits activity before adjusting rates. If SoFi Bank grants you a grace period, the dates for such grace period will be reflected on the APY Details page of your account. If SoFi Bank determines that you did not have Direct Deposit activity or $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits during the current 30-day Evaluation Period and, if applicable, the grace period, then you will begin earning the rates earned by account holders without either Direct Deposit or Qualifying Deposits until you have Direct Deposit activity or $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits in a subsequent 30-Day Evaluation Period. For the avoidance of doubt, an account holder with both Direct Deposit activity and Qualifying Deposits will earn the rates earned by account holders with Direct Deposit.\n\nMembers without either Direct Deposit activity or Qualifying Deposits, as determined by SoFi Bank, during a 30-Day Evaluation Period and, if applicable, the grace period, will earn 1.20% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances.\n\nInterest rates are variable and subject to change at any time. These rates are current as of 10/31/2024. There is no minimum balance requirement. Additional information can be found at http://www.sofi.com/legal/banking-rate-sheet.\n\n(ii) Up to Two Day Early Paycheck in your SoFi Checkings and Savings account. Early access to Direct Deposit funds is based on the timing in which we receive notice of impending payment from the Federal Reserve, which is typically up to two days before the scheduled payment date, but may vary.\n\n(iii) No Fee Overdraft Coverage for SoFi Plus members with at least $1,000 of Direct Deposits into a SoFi Checkings and Savings account during the 30-Day Evaluation Period. Overdraft Coverage is limited to $50 of coverage on SoFi Debit Card purchases only and does not apply to peer-to-peer transfers, bill payments, checks or other types of transactions. Members with a prior history of non-repayment of negative balances are ineligible for Overdraft Coverage.\n\n(iv) Personal Loan Direct Deposit Discount Terms and Conditions:\n\nTo be eligible to potentially receive an additional (0.25%) interest rate reduction for setting up Direct Deposit with a SoFi Checking and Savings account offered by SoFi Bank, N.A. or eligible cash management account offered by SoFi Securities, LLC (“Direct Deposit Account”), you must have an open Direct Deposit Account within 30 days of the funding of your Loan. Once eligible, you will receive this discount during periods in which you have enabled payroll Direct Deposit of at least $1,000/month to a Direct Deposit Account in accordance with SoFi’s reasonable procedures and requirements to be determined at SoFi’s sole discretion. This discount will be lost during periods in which SoFi determines you have turned off Direct Deposit to your Direct Deposit Account. You are not required to enroll in Direct Deposit to receive a loan.\n\n(v) 3% Cash Back Rewards on SoFi Credit Card Purchases for 12 months on Your SoFi Credit Card:\n\nYou will need to receive a Direct Deposit every month into your SoFi Checking or Savings account in order to continue to receive this promotional cash back rewards rate. Direct Deposit means a deposit into an account holder’s SoFi Checking or Savings account, including payroll, pension, or government payments (e.g., Social Security), made by the account holder’s employer, payroll or benefits provider or government agency (“Direct Deposit”) via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Network. Deposits that are not from an employer or government agency, including but not limited to check deposits, peer-to-peer transfers (e.g., transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc.), merchant transactions (e.g., transactions from PayPal, Stripe, Square, etc.), and bank ACH funds transfers and wire transfers from external accounts, do not constitute Direct Deposit activity and do not qualify for this promotion. It may take up to 90 days for your Direct Deposit to be recognized, after which you will begin earning 3% cash back rewards. If you do not see your 3% cash back rewards benefit after 90 days, please contact our help center. A maximum of 36,000 rewards points can be earned from this limited-time offer. After the Promotion Period ends or once you have earned the maximum points offered by this promotion, your cash back rewards earning rate will revert back to 2%. 36,000 rewards points are worth $360 when redeemed toward active SoFi accounts, including but not limited to, your SoFi Checking or Savings account, SoFi Money® account, SoFi Active Invest account, SoFi Credit Card account, SoFi Personal Loan, Private Student Loan, Student Loan Refinance, or toward SoFi Travel purchases.\n\nPromotion Period: The Program will be available from 4/5/22 12:01AM ET to 4/1/24 12:59 PM ET (the “Promotion Period”).

A 10% boost means that a 10% multiplier shall be applied to existing cash back rewards rates (e.g. a purchase previously earning 100 rewards points would now earn 110 with the promotion). For purposes of calculating the 10% boost on cash back rewards points, each transaction shall be rounded to the nearest dollar, and fractional points shall be rounded to the nearest whole point. The 10% boost shall not apply to (i) transactions that are not eligible for cash back rewards points, including: fees or interest charges, balance transfers or cash advances, purchase of traveler’s checks or other cash equivalents, purchase or reloading of prepaid cards, or other quasi-cash transactions; or (ii) courtesy rewards points that are manually awarded.

SoFi Bank reserves the right to grant a grace period to account holders following a change in Direct Deposit activity before terminating your 10% boost benefit. If SoFi Bank grants you a grace period, the dates for such grace period will be reflected on the APY Details page of your account. If SoFi Bank determines that you did not receive a Direct Deposit during the current 30-day Evaluation Period and, if applicable, the grace period, then you will no longer earn the 10% boost until you have Direct Deposit activity in a subsequent 30-Day Evaluation Period. In certain cases, it may take up to 90 days for your Direct Deposit to be recognized, after which you will begin earning the 10% boost on cash back rewards.

      "# [SOFI TUKKER joins Jermaine Dupri, 40+ creative thinkers at Ideas Festival Emory Sept. 20](https://news.emory.edu/stories/2024/09/er_ideas_festival_dupri_sofi_tukker_05-09-2024/story.html)\nGrammy-nominated genre-defying duo SOFI TUKKER has joined the lineup for the inaugural Ideas Festival Emory, organizers announced Sept. 9. The festival, a celebration of creative minds, is set to take place Sept. 20-22 on Emory University’s Oxford College campus.\n\nThe group, comprising Sophie Hawley-Weld and Tucker Halpern, recently released their third studio album “BREAD.” An acronym for Be Really Energetic and Dance, “BREAD” encapsulates their infectious music, which spreads themes of liberation, unity and self-empowerment. The band has amassed more than three billion streams, earned platinum and gold records on five continents and been featured in several brand campaigns for Apple, Peloton and Smartwater.\n\nAs part of the festival, the duo will speak with Matt Whyte, host of the Sing for Science podcast, which connects musicians with scientists. SOFI TUKKER will chat about bread, the beloved food staple, and the chemistry that makes it so delicious with Maria Ortiz — the food scientist behind the popular Instagram account All You Knead is Bread — on Sunday, Sept. 22 at 4:30 p.m.\n\nHosted by Emory’s Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, the event — which is free and open to the public — also features live music, local food vendors, children’s programming and exhibits. Festival registration is open.\n\nSOFI TUKKER joins the previously announced keynote speaker, renowned rapper, producer and record executive Jermaine Dupri, and more than 40 other speakers at the festival, intended to connect students and the greater community with visionary scholars, creators and thought leaders, including a Pulitzer-winning journalist, transformative business executive, New York Times-bestselling music historian and innovative toy designer.\n\nDuring the festival’s keynote session Friday evening, Dupri, a Grammy Award winner, Atlanta native and founder of So So Def Recordings, will engage in conversation with Whyte and Joycelyn Wilson, assistant professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at Georgia Tech. Through her work as an ethnographer, Wilson has traced the cultural forces that have shaped Atlanta’s unique identity as the thriving epicenter of hip hop and R&B.\n\nDelving into multiple themes\n\nAdditional speaker sessions on Saturday and Sunday will cover an array of themes including science, history, literature, entrepreneurship, music and cinematography and photography. The full schedule and speaker biographies are now available on the newly launched Ideas Festival Emory website.\n\nJust a few of the notable speakers include:\n\nBarbara Kopple, a two-time Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker;\n\nVirginia Willis, a James Beard award-winning cookbook author and chef;\n\nJon Goode, an Emmy-nominated writer whose work has been featured on CNN, HBO and BET;\n\nStephanie Stuckey, board chair of Stuckey’s, the candy manufacturer; and\n\nCarrie Buse, head of design for Mattel’s Future Lab, which focuses on innovative products and play experiences.\n\nThroughout the weekend, Ideas Festival Emory will feature live music and entertainment on the Oxford College quad, photography exhibits and food and drink vendors.\n\nThe event will also include children’s programming and collaborations with local schools. In partnership with the Newton Education Foundation, the Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement will host hundreds of students from Newton County Schools, providing them with a unique learning opportunity to connect with children’s book authors.\n\nThe festival has attracted sponsors committed to engaging individuals and families across the metro Atlanta region in its programming, including Lumina Foundation, WABE, the City of Covington and Rough Draft Atlanta.\n\nKen Carter, Charles Howard Candler Professor of Psychology and founding director of the Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, believes the festival — the center’s flagship event — will be distinctive in its mission to share ideas and spark curiosity with local and global audiences.\n\n“Ideas Festival Emory is a celebration of creativity and innovation, connecting the public with visionary leaders who inspire and challenge us,” says Carter. “We hope the festival will ignite new ideas and inspire meaningful conversations, in an environment that will be fun for people of all ages.”\n\nWhile attendees will engage with and learn from speakers during the sessions, Carter hopes the festival will have an impact that stretches beyond the three-day event. Speaker sessions will be recorded for an upcoming podcast that will help extend the festival's reach and attract curious listeners from around the world.\n\nThe Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, established in 2023, aims to help faculty and students proactively engage in public conversation and increase confidence in the value of scholarship and evidence-based research. With plans to expand its programming and host a Public Scholarship Academy for faculty in May 2025, the center — housed at Oxford College — hopes to establish itself as a novel space where scholars share knowledge and insights directly with the community.\n\n“I’m proud that Oxford College is home to the Emory Center for Public Scholarship and Engagement, and we look forward to hosting this incredible weekend of exploration and discovery on our beautiful campus,” says Oxford Dean Badia Ahad.\n\n“Bringing together a diversity of scholars, artists and writers to discuss some of the most pressing and complex issues of our time is particularly important in this cultural moment when we need more and better models of civil discourse, free expression of ideas and constructive dialogue,” Ahad continues. “This perfectly captures the spirit of education and collaboration we embrace here at Oxford and Emory.”",
      "# [SoFi Connection getting closer by GumbyDammet on 2023-12-29](https://community.quicken.com/discussion/7944565/sofi-connection-getting-closer)\nI try to connect my Quicken to my SoFi accounts every once in a while and I've gotten some success today. It appears as though the checking and saving accounts are downloading transactions with a few twists and turns.\n\nWith my first attempt, I linked all of my accounts and only got transactions for my checking account. It loaded a long history of transactions which matched to a lot of the reconciled transactions in my register along with a lot of old transactions that did not match. One thing I did notice is that it screws up the opening balance when it downloads so make sure you check it before you connect your account. I deleted all of the old, downloaded transactions that were reconciled but didn't match and accepted the rest.\n\nSince I only got the checking account transactions, I deactivated the connections for my savings account and vaults and tried connecting them again. This time I got the savings transactions but nothing for the vaults. Repeated the process used for checking to get the savings account reconciled.\n\nFinally, I deactivated the connections to my vaults and tried connecting them but did not get any transactions for any of my vaults.\n\nThe great news is that it looks like we are finally going to be able to download our SoFi transactions into Quicken for Windows. The bad news is that it is not quite there yet. I'll post an update in a few days to see if I get new transactions.\n\nInteresting.\n\nI am new to Sofi over the last 2 weeks. Since setting up Savings/Checking/CC, I was able to set-up all accounts in Quicken with the \"Add Account\" and searching Sofi. It found all three and has been downloading new transactions on them all for the past 2 weeks as I've transferred money in and made some initial purchases on the CC.\n\nYesterday I created 2 vaults… today I saw the transactions come in via the savings account (one for a balance of the vault and another showing the transfer from the Savings into the vault. I then hit \"add account\" again, and sure enough the two vaults showed up as additional accounts to add into Quicken.\n\nAt least for me… everything is working as I would expect from any other institution. I saw that multiple people have had issues over the past few months, but so far its been smooth for me.",

      "# [Exploring New Challenges to Create a Meaningful Career by Taylor Sullivan on 2024-07-11](https://sofietyblog.sofi.com/exploring-new-challenges)\nAt SoFi, we know our people are our greatest differentiator, and we are dedicated to empowering them to take ownership of their career journeys by pursuing internal opportunities, utilizing available resources, and embracing fresh challenges.\n\nShilpi is one of our employees who has taken the driver's seat of her career. She’s a Senior Staff Marketing Data Scientist on our Credit Card team. Her main focus is designing the data-driven acquisition strategy for Credit Card to optimize for profitability. She’s been at SoFi for over 5 years, and has had the opportunity to work on the Money and Member Products teams, too!\n\nIn this SoFi-ety spotlight, Shilpi shares how she stepped out of her comfort zone to achieve new career experiences at SoFi—and how she used those learnings to land a new role.\n\nWhat inspired you to pursue your current career path?\n\nShilpi: Prior to SoFi, I worked at a number of large banks. In joining SoFi, I had the unique opportunity to build the analytics foundation of one of our product lines from the ground up! This was a dream role for me and gave me the chance to lead many “first'' initiatives for SoFi’s Money and Bank businesses through close collaboration with our engineering, product, finance and risk teams. This first data analytics role helped me gain exposure and learn about every aspect of the money business, and I’m proud to say I was able to make a quick impact on the business. I have always been interested in data-driven problem solving and data science offers a compelling combination of analytical challenges, creative problem-solving, and the opportunity to contribute to various aspects of the business by leveraging the power of data.\n\nCan you share any experiences where you had to step out of your comfort zone to pursue new opportunities or tackle unfamiliar challenges?\n\nShilpi: I am always looking for opportunities that push me out of my comfort zone. When I oversaw Money/Bank product analytics for three years and the Credit Card product was launched, the team needed expertise to help scale the business. I stepped up and took additional responsibility for Credit Card and effectively managed analytics for two businesses. I also believe that by creating forums to present my work, I’ve been able to get the right visibility among senior management. I also believe it's important to have an open conversation with your manager and work with them on a plan to help you achieve your shared goals.\n\nHow do you approach professional development to continue growing in your career?\n\nShilpi: I believe in continuous learning. Data science is an ever-evolving field and it's important to embrace a growth mindset and commit to learning the latest technologies and best practices in the field, like acquiring new technical skills, improving soft skills or gaining domain-specific knowledge. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities for growth that combine my long term career aspirations with short term goals. Embracing challenges has helped me develop resilience, problem-solving skills, and adaptability.\n\nAdditionally, networking has played a big role in my professional journey. Moving from India and establishing myself in a new environment was possible only through building and nurturing a professional network of colleagues, mentors, and industry contacts. My mentors have provided me with the right guidance, feedback and support to navigate my career journey.\n\nHow have you taken advantage of opportunities for advancement in your career?\n\nShilpi: I have always approached my work with a high level of ownership and commitment. I have sought to demonstrate leadership qualities within projects even if they were unofficial. I take initiative, problem-solve, and foster collaboration. This has helped showcase my readiness for advancement and growth. I have consistently maintained high standards in my personal performance and demonstrated our SoFi values in the workplace.\n\nHow do you continually challenge yourself to drive your career growth?\n\nShilpi: I challenge myself by setting specific goals and working toward them. The goals are a combination of short- and long-term aspirations like learning new skills, completing a challenging project or taking on a leadership role. I also actively seek feedback from peers and mentors to identify areas for improvement and growth.\n\nThank you for sharing your incredible experience, Shilpi. One final question to get to know you a little more; If you could only eat one cuisine for the rest of your life, what would it be?\n\nShilpi: I am a big fan of Indian cuisine as it is a unique combination of regional and traditional foods. It is so diverse that I can eat it daily without getting bored of it.\n\nThe individual featured is a SoFi employee. Their personal experiences, obviously, do not take into account your own specific objectives, financial situation, and needs. Results will vary.\n\n©2024 Social Finance, Inc. All rights reserved.",

      "# [Launch Dates Confirmed for TGL presented by SoFi, Starting in Prime Time on ESPN](https://tglgolf.com/articles/2024/03/tgl-presented-by-sofi--coming-january-2025)\nMatches 1, 2 and 3 of the first TGL presented by SoFi season will all take place on Tuesdays in January and be live from SoFi Center. The first night of TGL action will be Tuesday, January 7th.\n\nThe full TGL schedule - including matchups - will be announced later this year.\n\nThe launch of TGL’s inaugural season will benefit from promotion during ESPN’s comprehensive coverage of the NFL Playoffs and new 12-team College Football Playoff. At this time of year, ESPN’s coverage includes TGL’s week 2 match on Tuesday, Jan 14, the night following ESPN’s Monday Night Football Wild Card Playoff game, and TGL’s week 3 match on Tuesday, Jan 21, the night following ESPN’s coverage of the College Football Playoff National Championship Game.\n\nESPN’s NFL Playoff game and College Football National Championship Game are traditionally the network’s most-watched games each year and drive January as the network’s most-watched month.\n\n“As we plan the 2025 launch of TGL presented by SoFi, we now have the first three Tuesdays in January circled to introduce sports fans to this new form of team golf. January is a tremendous time of year for fans looking for prime time sports and TGL’s launch will complement the start of the PGA TOUR season and take advantage of ESPN’s promotional machine across their coverage of the NFL and college football playoffs,” said Mike McCarley, founder and CEO of TMRW Sports.\n\n“We’re grateful for our tremendous partner SoFi, who shares in our vision to harness technology to create new approaches within traditional institutions. As construction proceeds on SoFi Center, we’re eager to introduce sports fans to TGL as we focus on the league’s debut this coming January.”\n\n“From our very first conversation, there’s been a natural alignment between TGL’s innovative, tech-forward approach to golf with SoFi’s similar approach to helping millions get their money right with our digital all-in-one banking and financial services platform,” said SoFi CEO Anthony Noto. “Investing in sports like our partnerships with the NFL and the NBA has proven unequivocally valuable, and we’re thrilled to be partnering with TMRW Sports to bring the SoFi Center and TGL to life.”\n\nAll the action will take place in the custom-built SoFi Center, a steel-supported structure located on the campus of Palm Beach State College in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. The six teams consist of the PGA TOUR's top talent who will compete in a 15-match regular season, plus semifinals and finals matches in the 250,000-square-foot venue.\n\nSoFi Center is an unprecedented, tech-infused arena for golf and will create an intimate and unique “greenside” experience for fans with 1,500 seats wrapping around TGL’s field of play, which is similar to the size of a football field at 97-yards long and 50-yards wide.\n\nTGL matches will start with teams teeing off from real grass tee boxes to play custom-designed, virtual holes projected onto a 64’x53’ screen, more than 24 times larger than a standard golf simulator screen (144 square feet, 16’x9’). Once teams are inside approximately 50 yards they will transition to live action and finish each hole within TGL’s GreenZone, a 22,475-square-foot short game complex that transforms between holes.\n\nThe GreenZone will use advanced technology to make each hole a unique challenge for the teams, including its 41-yard-wide turntable that rotates the green and three bunkers to change approach angles and using nearly 600 motorized actuators as part of Full Swing’s Virtual Green technology embedded under the synthetic putting surface to morph its topography.\n\nEvery shot will be broadcast live during TGL, with teams playing within a 40-second shot clock. All players will also be mic’d up to bring fans closer to the action with real-time strategy discussions.",

(abbreviated as SoFi) is an American personal finance and financial technology company.[3] Founded in 2011 at Stanford University,[4][5][6] it operates as a direct bank and supports other financial institutions through its technology platform.[7][8][9] As of 2024, SoFi reports 9.4 million customers and 160 million platform accounts.[10][11]\n\nIn its early years, SoFi focused on providing student loans, using data science to assess risk and offer borrowers lower interest rates.[12] Over time, the company expanded its offerings to include mortgages, personal loans, auto loans, credit cards, stock investing, insurance, estate planning and bank accounts, ultimately obtaining a U.S. bank charter.[7][13] SoFi also made acquisitions and began supporting other financial institutions through its technology platform in this period.[8][9] As of 2024, the company has gained recognition as a \"one-stop shop\" for financial services, noted for its \"competitive rates\" on savings accounts.[14][15][16]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\n2011–2013: Founding and early years\n\n[edit]\n\nSoFi, short for Social Finance, was founded at Stanford University in the Fall of 2011.[4][17] The founders were Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady, four students who met at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The founders hoped SoFi could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education.[18] The company's inaugural loan program was a pilot at Stanford; for this pilot program, 40 alumni loaned about $2 million to approximately 100 students, for an average of $20,000 per student.[18][19][20]\n\nIn September 2012, SoFi raised $77.2 million, led by Baseline Ventures, with participation from DCM and Renren.[21][22] Additional investors included Ron Suber.[23]\n\nOn October 2, 2013, SoFi announced that it had raised $500 million in debt and equity to fund and refinance student loans. This total funding amount came from $90 million in equity, $151 million in debt, and $200 million in bank participations, with the remaining capital from alumni and community investors.[24] The $151 million in debt includes a $60 million line of credit from Morgan Stanley, and a $41 million line of credit from Bancorp.[25][26][27]\n\nAs of September 2013, SoFi had funded $200 million in loans to 2500 borrowers at the company's 100 eligible schools.[28]\n\nIn November 2013, SoFi announced a deal with Barclays and Morgan Stanley to create a bond backed by peer-to-peer student loans, which would create the first securitization of these loans to receive a credit rating.[29]\n\n2014–2018: Expansion, challenges, FTC charges\n\n[edit]\n\nIn April 2014, SoFi raised $80 million in a Series C round led by Discovery Capital Management with participation from Peter Thiel, Wicklow Capital, and existing investors. Money was raised to expand the footprint of the company's student loan refinancing business and to extend into new products like mortgages and personal loans.[30]\n\nIn February 2015, the company announced a $200 million funding round led by Third Point Management. That same month, the company officially began offering personal loans.[31][32] By March 2015, the company was offering mortgages in more than 20 states, up from its initial launch that included under ten states in October 2014.[33][34] By April 2015, the company had funded more than $2 billion in loans, including student loan refinancing, mortgages, personal loans, and MBA loans. To celebrate its $2 billion milestone, SoFi announced a contest, #2BillionTogether, to pay off one of its members student loans.[35] In September 2015, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt was added as an advisor. The firm also raised a $1 billion round of investment from SoftBank[36] and said it had funded $4 billion in loans.[37]\n\nIn May 2016, SoFi became the first startup online lender to receive a triple-A rating from Moody's. In September 2016, SoFi launched SoFi at Work, an employee benefit program to reduce student debt and build financial wellness, and announced it has more than 600 corporate partners.[38] As of October 2016, SoFi has funded more than $12 billion in total loan volume and has 175,000 members.[39] In February 2017, it was announced that SoFi raised an additional $500 million from an investor group led by Silver Lake, and also including SoftBank, to help support global expansion.[40][41] In May 2017, Reuters reported that SoFi had launched a new online wealth management service, and referenced the company as \"one of the largest online lenders\" in the U.S.[42]\n\nOn September 11, 2017, CEO Mike Cagney announced he would resign by the end of year due to allegations of sexual harassment and skirting risk and compliance controls.[43] Announced January 23, 2018, Anthony Noto resigned from his position as COO of Twitter, to become the CEO of SoFi.[44][45] In April 2018, SoFi announced that Michelle Gill, who previously worked at TPG and Goldman Sachs, was joining the company as Chief Financial Officer.[46]\n\nIn October 2018, SoFi settled Federal Trade Commission (FTC) charges, agreeing to stop making false claims about savings from student loan refinancing. The FTC alleged that SoFi had been making such false claims since April 2016.[47] In February 2019, the FTC announced its approval of the final consent order under which SoFi is prohibited from misrepresenting to consumers how much money consumers will save or have saved using its products and from making any claims about any such savings unless the claims are backed up with reliable evidence.[48] The order expires on February 22, 2039, or 20 years from the Commission's most recent date of filing a complaint in federal court reporting any misconduct that occurs later.[49]\n\n2019–2024: Going public and diversification\n\n[edit]\n\nIn May 2019, SoFi closed $500 million in a single funding round led by Qatar Investment Authority.[50] In September 2019, SoFi signed a 20-year deal with the Los Angeles Rams and the Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL) for the naming rights to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.[51] The deal, which is worth $30 million annually, is a record for any naming rights for a sports venue.[52] In April 2020, SoFi acquired Salt Lake City-based financial services API and payments platform \"Galileo\" for $1.2 billion in stock and cash,[9] and Hong Kong–based investment app \"8 Securities\".[53] SoFi went public through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) backed by Chamath Palihapitiya raising up to $2.4 billion at a $9 billion valuation.[54] It began trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol SOFI on June 1, 2021.[55]\n\nIn January 2022, SoFi received approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for a national bank charter.[56][57] In February 2022, SoFi purchased Golden Pacific Bancorp, owner of Sacramento, California based Golden Pacific Bank, for $22.3 million.[58] This allowed SoFi to hold loans for investment as opposed to selling them to outside investors,[59] and allowed it to obtain the bank charter from the OCC.[60][13] In March, SoFi acquired Technisys, a cloud-based banking system, for $1.1 billion.[61][8][62]\n\nIn 2023, SoFi was named as one of the World's Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company in March and one of the World's Top Fintech Companies by CNBC in August.[63][64] In January, the company was quoted to claim nearly 6% market share in the U.S. personal loans business.[65] Later, by March, it had reached over $10B in total deposits.[66][67] The same month, SoFi sued the Biden administration to block the pause on student loan repayment, saying it was hurting its business.[68] SoFi dropped the lawsuit three months later, after a debt ceiling deal had been signed into law which provided a clear timeline for the resumption of student loan repayments.[69] In April 2023, the company announced it had acquired Wyndham Capital Mortgage in an all-cash deal.[70][71] According to American Banker in July 2023, SoFi had an estimated 60% share in the U.S. student loan refinancing market.[72] By December 2023, the company reportedly had a 9.5% market share in \"unsecured lending within a specific credit box\" and a 0.1% share in the home loan market in the U.S.[73]\n\nIn April 2024, a CNN study recognized SoFi as the \"best student loan refinance lender\". The study highlighted SoFi's competitive rates, flexible terms, and various perks. However, it also noted areas for improvement, specifically in disclosing the minimum credit score requirement and offering a cosigner release option for refinance loans.[74] During the same month, another study cited SoFi's auto repair loans as the \"best for customer benefits,\" while also noting some downsides, including a high credit score requirement, a minimum loan amount of over $5,000, lack of disclosure on the minimum income requirement, and limited nationwide availability.[75]\n\nIn May 2024, SoFi was fined $1,100,000 for creating a cash management brokerage account system that people subsequently used to fraudulently withdraw funds from accounts that did not belong to them by using stolen identities or fake identification. SoFi was found to have failed to set up proper safeguards to prevent this from happening. Around 800 of these accounts were opened, and were used to transfer some $8.6 million from other people's customer accounts.[76] That same month, CNN cited SoFi as the \"best online personal loan\" provider. The lender was stated as offering \"larger loan amounts than most competitors\" while not asking to pay origination fees.[77] Separately, SoFi was called the \"best for investors who want a one-stop shop for all their money needs\". The company was said to offer \"competitive rates\" in savings and checking accounts and \"free access to professional financial advisors who do not sell products\" and must provide advice in line with the best interests of SoFi's customers.[14][15][16]\n\nIn August 2024, both CBS News and USA Today ranked SoFi as the \"best overall\" provider of personal loans. The company was said to be able to lend money on the same day as approval for a majority of the approved applications.[78][79] Separately, SoFi's personal loans were cited as the \"best for long repayment terms\" and were noted for offering repayment periods up to 84 months and loan amounts up to $100,000.[80][81] The personal loans were also recognized as the \"best for refinancing high-interest debt\".[82] In the following month, SoFi's mortgage lending was cited as the \"best for saving money\", noted for the discounts it offered.[83]\n\nIn October 2024, SoFi's Form 8-K for July-September 2024, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, stated that the number of SoFi members (customers) was nearly 9.4 million and that the company's \"technology platform enabled accounts\" numbered 160 million.[10][11]\n\nBusiness model\n\n[edit]\n\nSoFi originally utilized an alumni-funded lending model that connected students and recent graduates with alumni and institutional investors via school-specific student loan funds.[84] Investors received a financial return and borrowers received rates lower than the federal government offered. The company sought to minimize defaults by focusing on low-risk students and graduates, using data science to determine risk and offer borrowers a lower rate.[85][12]\n\nAs SoFi's offerings expanded to include mortgages, mortgage refinancing, personal loans, auto loans, credit cards, stock investing, insurance, estate planning and bank accounts, the company placed focus on digital banking methods, without operating physical branches.[7] As of 2024, it operates as a personal finance company as well as a fintech company,[3][86][87] and comprises three divisions: lending, technology platform and financial services. The lending division, SoFi's largest source of revenue as of 2023, generates income from net interest, securitization sales, and whole loan sales. The technology platform division generates income via Galileo's customer services, including platform access and card management services, offered in form of APIs.[88][89] The financial services division generates income from transaction and management fees, share lending, and other sources.[90][91][92]\n\nProducts\n\n[edit]\n\nLending\n\n[edit]\n\nPersonal loans, student loans, home loans, and loan refinancing are all part of SoFi's lending services.[93] In 2015, four years after its launch, SoFi had over $6 billion in loans issued, becoming one of the largest marketplace lenders.[94] They continue to maintain a policy of no fees for their loans, aside from the interest.[citation needed]\n\nStock investing\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2018, SoFi introduced commission and fee-free trades of stocks and exchange-traded funds under the name SoFi Invest (formerly SoFi Wealth).[95] This service is now called SoFi Active investing.[96]\n\nAs of December 2023 , SoFi's assets for the fiscal year totaled $27.98 billion.[97][third-party source needed] Services offered also include traditional IRA, Roth IRA, and SEP IRA retirement accounts.[98]\n\nCryptocurrency trading (closed in 2023)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2019, SoFi launched a partnership with Coinbase to offer cryptocurrency trading,[99][100] offering trading of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and more than 17 other crypto assets to users in every U.S state apart from Hawaii, New Jersey, and West Virginia.[101] Cryptocurrency transactions were one of SoFi's only products that have fees.[102] In December 2023, SoFi shuttered its cryptocurrency services.[103][104]\n\nBank accounts and credit cards\n\n[edit]\n\nSoFi offers a high-yield checking/savings account with no fees that is backed by the FDIC.[105] Their cash management (checking) accounts and investment platform include brokerage and robo-advisor services.[106] In July 2020, SoFi launched a partnership with Samsung Pay to launch Samsung Money by SoFi, a cash management checking/savings accounts, with a digital and physical debit card.[107][108] In late 2020, SoFi launched its first-ever credit card.[109][110] In 2022, SoFi launched SoFi Money under SoFi Bank, a checking and savings account. The previous cash management account was deprecated to pay zero percent interest, which caused controversy.[111][112]\n\nSoFi Relay, a credit score monitoring and budgeting tool, is available to anyone who registers a free SoFi account. The service allows users to track their money in bank, credit card, investment, and loan balances and transactions as well as set financial goals. No-cost credit score tracking with weekly updates is provided through TransUnion.[113] In August 2023, SoFi began integrating Galileo Financial Technologies' conversational AI engine into its personal finance application.[114]\n\nInsurance\n\n[edit]\n\nSoFi has partnered with several third party insurance companies, such as Lemonade, Inc., in order to offer life insurance, auto insurance, homeowners insurance, and renters insurance.[115][116]\n\nBanking technology platform\n\n[edit]\n\nSoFi is a provider of digital banking software to multiple banks and fintech brands in the U.S. and Latin America.[117] The company also provides API access to its technology platform, supporting banks in processing credit card payments and helping businesses launch financial services.[88][89]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]",
